[00:09]
yes dj
drop the beat drop the beat

[00:21]
a lot of [ __ ] has happened because
when i first started watching i think
the game just started and they didn't
have this much money

[00:33]
this is just a flip looks like just a
flip just a little flip

[00:46]
shout out to the poker click oh wait you
want another part here
h5 offsuit okay okay okay
pre-bet call that big
against close enough with the h5rs

[01:12]
against close enough with the h5rs
probably prefer a check race but hey who
am i who am i

[01:16]
am i who am i
to say right i'm the wacko
i'm going to play some 500 zoom yes yes
yes yes yes
big ass kubus

[01:31]
big ass kubus
he's back wacko's back yes thank you
thank you thank you
we got it through guys with the h4 if we
have made a little c bet
he went away here with the king jack
decide to check back

[01:46]
decide to check back
we'll do that again
probably have to call the river but
but it's expensive huh

[02:03]
he's saying that he slowplayed something
that he made a flush it's
unlikely joey just started the channel
again with bluff catching you know you
guys know i don't like the folder

[02:16]
boom
oh

[02:37]
okay double flash drop board
is that one where [ __ ] gets interesting

[02:46]
the early position i'm gonna go quite
older on this turn i'm gonna make some
big ass bets
175 percent what seems appropriate

[03:00]
already like the only sizing i ever have
here
boo and now hope he didn't have 10 jack
actually that's quite unlike that

[03:16]
deck
then jack is quite unlikely i would say
because he could probably check her is
that on the turn i think i'm
probably the way to go here

[03:34]
volts and in the meanwhile or go for
little every race here with the fight
for suit
and we said we had seven deuce

[03:51]
gonna start off with a little sea vet
don't really have the greatest hands but
you know

[04:03]
i have potential mate or as we say in
dutch potency
ah and we got one true shout out to me
too much
let's go another part against knee two
my three

[04:15]
my three
what percent let's just lead out here
he doesn't expect me to lead out with
with a boat here this is
this is next level leveling going on
here
this next level leveling i would never
do this with a 5 or a boat come on

[04:30]
do this with a 5 or a boat come on
you know this
who's going to race wrong timing
i told you

[04:54]
um

[05:01]
chips and crips is also in the house
guys obviously straightaway through
betting me
he checks back okay

[05:19]
i'll go for a little bit
regardless in holland guys akito

[05:36]
bachchan
let's see if he gets keto

[05:46]
and on the other table guys we by the
way have top set versus chips encrypt
fourth pair i have

[06:03]
seven dudes guys we still have the seven
deuce
and we're gonna rip it in

[06:32]
and i was like yeah you will never lead
out a hand
that cannot jam the river right ah
[Music]

[06:45]
[Music]
blue so also in the house guys oh oh oh
this is gonna become
one crazy zoom pool we got chips and
crips
me too my three floofsu this and that's
quick
and he likes to do this betting here

[07:00]
and he likes to do this betting here
because we've had a hand earlier to him
i don't think i can basically fold any
hand for
this sizing obviously depending on his
how he constructs his dividing range i
would say
he checks i think it's a good spot to

[07:16]
he checks i think it's a good spot to
start betting

[07:33]
we're going to bed the river again
kind of think of sizing here

[07:46]
probably an over bed right
ha snip god it's a snap call
mr jew jasper johnson thank you very

[08:01]
mr jew jasper johnson thank you very
much sir
hope i won't let you down
here one describer come on mr chips
encryption
how fast can you for batman is there
literally a faster button than this

[08:18]
okay just we just go and flop a set
not bad not bad jakai board isn't great
snapchat no this is chris man the guy

[08:30]
snapchat no this is chris man the guy
the guy is like basically arlene is
awesome chess
i forgot actually what the name was
check

[08:48]
i think we have a block

[09:03]
and he falls i think he's a fine
candidate for a check race

[09:23]
he calls now i think probably
check is best

[09:31]
yeah we're probably sort of
play range check uku japanese wreck he
also plays
high sticks what do i think actually i
haven't really played much with you guys
let's see indeed also plays high stakes

[09:47]
let's see indeed also plays high stakes
he blocks
basically i think this this line will
play out like this quite often
now on the turnout we'll kind of mix it
up
and go again we hit three pair on the
river

[10:00]
river
prepare ain't bad so we maybe lead like
some of the time
probably right

[10:22]
actually it's probably not a great lead
when you have a seven in your hand the
high side
if i would have like queen exit clubs or
something i would definitely play this
way i think this is a good lead

[10:34]
but obviously like yeah that's exactly
that i was going for

[10:46]
that i was going for
here we're going to get it in with the
ace queen let's go
flip but you want to cash out let's cash
out
resume okay you're a loss your loss

[11:01]
resume okay you're a loss your loss
your loss like
c c
oh let's go oh let's go
lexi lexi let's go oh

[11:16]
lexi lexi let's go oh
let's go let's see
back back
back see put your hands up more legs put
your hands up

[11:40]
collect

[11:47]
that's either
this hand in a vacuum i will step

[12:43]
all right go nowhere

[12:47]
it's a big money man it's got a big
money bet
oh that now finally now finally bet
someone bets the sizing that i can
actually consider folding that's good
that's actually quite good still not

[13:00]
that's actually quite good still not
gonna do it
but hey you tried them you tried you
tried hard
that's fair don't think it was against
him but hey i don't care
i think it's fair if pokerstars would

[13:15]
i think it's fair if pokerstars would
just give one back
uh-oh king high board ace king more
combos than kings
even though i have space i was still i
was just confirming that yes
guys twice more likely

[13:31]
a little bit little twenty percent
i do want to give a shout out afterwards
after all this chaos airs finish to the
guy
trying to block me with 300 because he

[13:45]
trying to block me with 300 because he
really tried
and i admire that i admire the spirit of
trying
people still are not watching the tree
stream because they they know i don't
fool
but they still try i can admire i can
only admire them

[14:13]
i really hope he doesn't have kinks

[14:16]
i really hope he doesn't have kinks
so don't hope that the river is a
diamond
that's a good river that's just 6'5
suited
actually that that is actually somewhat

[14:31]
actually that that is actually somewhat
likely now
would be six five diamonds could have
fast played that at some point
but let's say let's say that's one combo
three so it's four commas that was beat
he always has ace king

[14:46]
he always has ace king
six combos he can hero fall
too then we should still jam

[15:00]
oh my god

[15:15]
ace king a sad guy man he has been
i don't think the guy i think the guy is
a sweden
it's probably a wreck
i like the way he's playing it

[15:30]
i like the way he's playing it
i like set actually i do recall
something with
set wasn't he like an old school legend
like high-stakes player that
sounds familiar

[16:20]
okay okay gg set i really like set then
now this is good play i really like it

[16:45]
does he have to bolster just ship it in
now
no he doesn't
occur is what he has king jack

[17:00]
occur is what he has king jack
gigi if seth knows about the stream set
come on the stream man
we'd love to chat with you and about
your new refound interesting poke

[17:16]
what did we do with this santa
this guy also it's a

[17:34]
not really sure what it is
that what does he check raise flop back

[17:48]
that what does he check raise flop back
turn
right a little bit

[18:00]
right a little bit
dolls
actually gonna make a nitty check here
[ __ ] people are trying
like in terms of aces guys asus is not

[18:16]
like in terms of aces guys asus is not
our hand today
asus is not our hand

[18:41]
hey four bets to me hi stephanie st
we're tangling here with miss and

[18:45]
we're tangling here with miss and
esquick okay okay
you flop again it's a good flop

[19:00]
we block a5 suited that's good we block
king fire suited that's good
it checks
it's actually quite a

[19:15]
i mean if he has we're quite deep right
i don't think there's much incentive in
flow playing
if he has asian king there's no example
in stop playing

[19:40]
probably just

[19:57]
what's he saying that he has i don't get

[20:04]
it
