[00:00]
you know what i do when i flop aces with
ace we go feel how much
[Music]
got a little announcement for you guys
because next to our mechanics of poker
program and master classes we have now

[00:16]
program and master classes we have now
released the poker ambition academy in
this academy you will be receiving
weekly interactive webinars based on
your pain points we will be discussing
all areas that you can improve in to

[00:30]

taught by coaches who have walked the
path that you're currently walking so if
you're interested go over to the site
and i'm looking forward to seeing you in
the academy right guys
got back just in time went to the gym

[00:45]
got back just in time went to the gym
a little uh
sauna session
but just in time uh come back just in
time for the free rule to start over
mission prior right here

[01:00]
mission prior right here
we're gonna show some tournament skills
today
starting off with a little four-way pot
with five news
i'm gonna bet this hand again

[01:16]
on a bad i wanna actually bet one big
blind but i'll go for the two big five
many faults
there's one for the wacom guys one for
the wacko five high like a boss got a
call sometimes

[01:31]
call sometimes
89 i think i will call but
not too happy about it
they went to seven if you would have
went seven and a half
pick on a queen five six i'm going to

[01:45]
pick on a queen five six i'm going to
call one
with pocket eight
it's a good turn
which is gonna happen
often enough that's why pocket eight you
know it was a good hand to fall like
[ __ ] tense i would just fold the flop

[02:04]
my pocket is definitely calling
uh we could do actually a couple things
here on the turn
for this rainbow so i don't think i'm
gonna check race

[02:17]
maybe end like five four suited or
something or seven eight suited would be
okay and to check race but this end i'm
just gonna call
maybe barrel is gonna be quite
interesting

[02:30]
he did decide to give up
but it's a little a little chicken sound
for chops there
[Music]
he was thinking about
the ace king decided to give up

[02:45]
the ace king decided to give up
he was probably going for it
but i guess then he realized that
probably blocking some of my fault
here we have not been so not going
anywhere
top pair not going anywhere right

[03:03]
oh don't
yes i do

[03:16]
so i have a bounty on my head basically
if you kick me out you get extra points
academy free rules
let me see guys
so in the end
neander fighting for this
oh by the way guys today's also the last

[03:31]
oh by the way guys today's also the last
uh the last black friday discount so if
you want to join next month's seminar
this is your chance
so over again we can weigh over ten
thousand dollar value
basically you can score points and win
some free [ __ ] in the free rules

[03:46]
some free [ __ ] in the free rules
and after i think four editions so the
fourth month or the fifth month not sure
you're gonna play a free roll for this
you can win the three mechanics of poker
free masterclass some discounts that's
gonna be the the prize pool

[04:02]
let me go for a little better with the
pocket eight it's quite close though
it's quite close
i'm going to check the turn
big bucket dates is probably still

[04:16]
big bucket dates is probably still
calling
some of the time
let's try it
here's a jack not bluffing me my friend

[04:31]
here's a jack not bluffing me my friend
not blocking me
[Music]
not bluffing me
how sick is that
oh my god

[04:45]
oh my god
am i the best
10 a minute sit say it you have to say
i'll probably check racist some of the
time but on a one
not this time
gonna turn straight
life's good definitely good spot to do
some check raising
and here i actually face check

[05:03]
and here i actually face check
and i think it's an okay spot dark build
snapseed backlash equity to go with my
hand
turn is close i think if we do stab ace
jack

[05:16]
jack
between definitely barreling i think i'm
gonna go for
check we don't always bet this hand
anyway
and here
definitely going to go for a check raise

[05:34]
and i'm going to check
here face a back on the river
[Music]
and

[05:47]
i don't think we can jam anymore oh i
got the wrong one day nine the river was
quite bad let me show you
the river was quite bad
it was uh a queen

[06:01]
it was uh a queen
which jack nine is definitely
in both people's ranges
but probably my main bluffing candidate
which now got in
he could potentially still have ace jack

[06:15]
he could potentially still have ace jack
or jack9 himself
so i definitely think it's a spot where
i should slow down a little bit so
actually i went for three quarters bet
and he actually snapped me off
which
he's actually blocking i think some of
my blocks i think i can definitely be

[06:32]
my blocks i think i can definitely be
he can even call it mergy
a little bit mergy on the term weight of
seven so i don't think a seven is
necessarily a great hand to have
he's not blocking any of my volume

[06:47]
he's not blocking any of my volume
oh no i don't think it's necessarily a
snap call on the river unless he thinks
i'm crazy
i'll leave that i'll leave that up to
the viewers again aggressive plays rng
people watching we're now in the zoom

[07:00]

that's an aside flop
you know what i do when i flop aces with

[08:00]
you know what i do when i flop aces with
ace he go feel home
don't tell him he got aces don't tell
him

[08:15]
this line is going to be very in line
with the aces and kings that i'm going
to take now
very like
here i'm gonna pray that i can play the
chicken song and win a showdown

[08:33]
okay we jumped
we took guys
you know what they say lee
everyone loves a chop pot do you need
some help playing three bad pots out of
position well for that we have created

[08:45]
position well for that we have created
our master classes in which we dedicate
one coaching program to dive very deep
into a specific spot go over to the site
pokermission.com masterclasses and
eliminate those weaknesses
oh bretsky bretzky bretsky what you

[09:01]
oh bretsky bretzky bretsky what you
doing mate
what you doing mate what you doing what
you're doing
you're a little forgot
i don't mind if i do why not

[09:19]
yo loco
and he falls

[09:30]
that's how we do it guys
guys we reached the final table which
isn't that hard with uh some entries

[09:45]
isn't that hard with uh some entries
okay four bets
it's going quite big
could be exploitative as i have my
favorite hand

[10:12]
um

[10:16]
draw a little check rescue
they were in aggressive mood okay folds
a spicy plate guys spicy place this is
this is getting spicy this is getting
spicy this is spicy as [ __ ] spice

[10:30]
spicy this is spicy as [ __ ] spice
spice all right
the bobby phias is in the mix as well
little three red bubble asking suit it
wouldn't be so bad

[10:47]
pretty big
for this side i'm just gonna rip it in
falling and letting him in
maybe he does something stupid

[11:28]
did that stupid thing that i talked
about

[11:33]
assume he's not doing this with a boat
so i assume our outer life
can we dominate him maybe as jack queen
club something

[11:48]
oh that worked out quite well now didn't
need weko
come on on your bike
on your bike

[12:03]
you play very well you play very very
well
this is not something someone to learn
from
you see guys two trees in the hand one

[12:15]
you see guys two trees in the hand one
tree on the board
that means we have a set
a set ain't bat you know that's what i
like to say that ain't bad

[12:43]
here we go

[12:45]
here we go
that's quite unlucky sir that's quite
unlucky
i'm gonna win this [ __ ] thing i feel
it
i'm gonna limp this don't try this at
home guy

[13:01]
quite a big big raise here from bretsky

[13:16]
shout out
seven dudes never lose
that's right ciao do you miss brett
fluffy comes with seven dudes we got a
cold format in position the a screen
suit it probably just calls

[13:32]
lapanese means trouble in paradise

[13:49]
but uh obviously still calling one like
the flush draw
another ace can roll off
or we can hit a queen

[14:00]
or the board can run out four four
then we play the board
actually it's quite a big sizing i think
i'm already gonna fold quite a lot of
hands

[14:15]
to be honest
interesting

[14:31]
because for this barrel i think
things still have a call again
again not much we can do
and re-evaluate on the river

[14:52]
pick a much rather call
by other aces than ace
i think he could definitely bluff hand
like king queen suited

[15:01]
like king queen suited
so on the river i'm not really going to
call with this age let's say that ace
five suited i think that's a fine call
but uh this is not so much
definitely also spot where i can still
have ace king in my range
and we have no win

[15:15]
and we have no win
and a casualty bingo lino is out gg
did you sir
gg ski with king queen
i'm just gonna damn

[15:30]
i'm just gonna damn
that's what i'm gonna do with king
i don't give any [ __ ]
just gonna go all in
and have them decide
run into aces are you [ __ ] kidding me

[15:45]
nice life nice life decided to you know
make that the moment that we're gonna
change this chip stack towards our favor
so we can put a lot of pressure on these
these guys here on the left but no so
sick
it's so i hate poker so much

[16:01]
it's so i hate poker so much
oh so till
so tilt lil flipski and we have a
casualty mr daniel peterson is out
you're out sir
you're out game over gg
down dog

[16:34]
i think i just want to get a call here
from a flush

[16:45]
i don't want to go too big
i think after calling the check race
there it's very hard for me to have a
buff i think it just out of place
jack 10. probably normally you know in
probably normally all in actually i am
actually not really bubbling to be
honest

[17:00]
honest
oh wait but i do have to take
consideration that i have a bounty on my
head
that's worth more than a bubble

[17:17]
that makes actually so actually the
bubble doesn't really count on me
what's the bubble situation here
oh wait there's an o in ace king

[17:30]
oh wait there's an o in ace king
bubble is bursting the bubble has
bursted
everyone is guaranteed two points
for
the lady point gg seven points for first
five points per second four points for
three two point four four
and with those points you can uh make it

[17:46]
and with those points you can uh make it
to the grand grand final
which is going to be in two months so
you can still register into the academy
today it's also black friday still last
day
so for 50 euro you can enter the free

the [ __ ] how does he get [ __ ]
rewarded for that [ __ ] [ __ ] play
