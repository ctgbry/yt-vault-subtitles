[00:00]
and actually another diamond did come in
he called twice
and we decided to throw our stacking
blocking aces blocking
ace queen and diamonds ace jacket
diamonds ace tenor diamond type of
holdings i think

[00:17]
holdings i think
hi guys welcome back in this video we're
going to continue
triple barreling we're gonna continue
where we left off
after just losing a big pot and in the
next hand we are gonna try to win our

[00:30]
next hand we are gonna try to win our
money back triple barrelling as always
if you did like the way i tried to win
my money back give this video a thumbs
up
also leave a comment down below without
further ado let's get into the tripling
we have the queen eight we open the

[00:45]
we have the queen eight we open the
bottom same villain calls let's see if
we
can win some money back king 710 board
i decided to go for it three quarters
bat it's a it's a
it's a board where you could definitely
start adding some up sizes i think we
could even go bigger than this

[01:02]
still some arguments for one third so i
think we will have a split betting
strategy
between bigs big bad small bets and
check queen eight i think it's fine in
this sizing
now the turn is a six i decide to barrel

[01:16]
now the turn is a six i decide to barrel
i go for
three quarters again like like earlier
it's a split betting
it's a split spot where you have some
over beds on three quarters
the board does contain a little bit more
connectivity usually
leading to sizing down for the

[01:30]
leading to sizing down for the
imposition
so i don't mind my three quarter bets he
calls
and on the river it's a six and
i decide to shove my stack in trying to
win back my money that i lost with the
ace queen
uh he thinks about it for a little while

[01:46]
uh he thinks about it for a little while
unfolds
uh but basically the idea is quite
simple again uh
we do have a blocker to probably like
some of his stronger hands
let's say king queen or eight nine uh
even though i think king queen could

[02:00]
even though i think king queen could
check raise some of the time
on the flop no actually we bet it a
little bit bigger so i guess it is
relevant
in terms of an absolute strong hand for
him um
but i think mainly the eight here is
very important as we are blocking eight
nine if you didn't check raise it on the

[02:15]
nine if you didn't check raise it on the
turn
our blockers are quite relevant so again
a little bit of a similar spot however
here
the straight already came in on the turn
and he didn't race
usually still giving us the advantage
instead of the straight hitted on the
river like in earlier hands

[02:35]
river like in earlier hands
a little bit of a different spot this
time we are actually the limper against
mr otp
himself let's see let's see if we can
bluff the otp

[02:46]
bluff the otp
in general uh abort that not gonna
necessarily bad range in the limp pot
due to the ranged interactions but i
think eight nine is probably one of your
first betting candidates
in terms of a bluff as it has some
potential so i bet

[03:00]
potential so i bet
turn is a diamond and i decide to block
um i think it's
fine i don't think we should size much
bigger than like three quarters
uh i think block i think i think i think
actually block is fine basically

[03:16]
actually block is fine basically
the smaller you bet the wider you can
bet for value um
yeah i don't necessarily mind my block i
also wouldn't mind uh
three quarters but he calls and on the
river we get a similar situation
as earlier where we kind of now make a

[03:31]
as earlier where we kind of now make a
lot of hands that he cannot have so king
queen
jack queen 910
probably does have at least witted
diamonds
but where we have a nine so that's quite
favorable we still are blocking a flush

[03:45]
favorable we still are blocking a flush
with the eight at diamonds
and in general i think we have quite a
big advantage given it's a limp pot
and the port contains three broadways
and suited hands where
usually those are hands that your
imposition is going to race
so i decided to go for an over bet so

[04:00]
so i decided to go for an over bet so
again from a range perspective how the
run-up came and how the preferred brain
just look
you kind of see if you have an advantage
and then adjust your bat sizing
accordingly
so i did over bat and he did decide to
bluff
to fault winning us a little pot again

[04:16]
to fault winning us a little pot again
you could have made arguments to go even
bigger
uh but i think this way we can still bat
a one bear hand given it's a limp pod
let's say we have a good king like king
10 or something i think we
we could still um we could still bet for

[04:32]
we could still um we could still bet for
this sizing
we have an eight and nine kind of
blocking his best king x i think king
ate king nine
king nine is definitely calling so in
terms of blockers i think we also do
well

[04:47]
another little limp up spot which kind
of has a similar
idea flopcom's ajak 9 actually a board
that we could already consider
starting with an over bat or you can
just batman basically range as the

[05:00]
just batman basically range as the
imposition
he cannot really do much so it's an it's
an easy spot
he should actually over fold as well in
theory
that's kind of how the spot plays we bet
a lot and then we check a lot and
yeah that's kind of it uh the turn

[05:15]
yeah that's kind of it uh the turn
brings the king
uh thus giving us more advantage like i
said a hand like king jack for example
his hand that he would most likely race
preflop
queen 10 now also has a straight which
is also likely to raise pre-flop
and if he didn't we do have the 10 and

[05:30]
and if he didn't we do have the 10 and
as well here we could decide to go for a
bigger
sizing i think at some point on these
kind of boards given the range
interactions you should
use bigger sizings i think in a lot of
these hands i kind of delayed them to
the river
maybe nowadays i would kind of already
start

[05:45]
start
being more aggressive on the turn but
like i said there are benefits um
and here on the river we see kind of a
similar trend how i've been kind of
playing my hands
um where i go for a big over bed now
kind of saying like listen i have all

[06:01]
kind of saying like listen i have all
the two pairs i have all the straights
that you're lacking good luck with that
and it's going to be very hard for
imposition to defend and we can still go
quite thin for value
as he didn't race on earlier streets and
we just have such an advantage given how

[06:16]
we just have such an advantage given how
kept he is given the preflop action
and he does fault so we again a trend is
that we're we're winning the small pots
and we're losing the big pots
usually not a great strategy for
long-term long-term money in your

[06:30]
long-term long-term money in your
account but
you know we'll take it we'll take it
another hand in this hand is actually a
little bit different uh we're opening
the queen
six i'm opening here for four excising
basically i'm using a split
split betting strategy uh queen six i

[06:45]
split betting strategy uh queen six i
think is a fine hand to go in the race
i decided to go for a small bet and the
villain calls
and the turn is a jack think
split betting strategy again would make
sense big bad small bat

[07:00]
sense big bad small bat
is usually kind of the philosophy i use
and i think actually this hand the hand
specifically i think should probably go
in a big pad
but i went for the small bit as i think
it in general it's a good strategy to
use in this kind of situations

[07:18]
actually you could make because usually
then you want to
put like stronger draw so let's add in
like queen 7 i think it's definitely a
small bat
but when you have a stronger draw like
for example in this case queen six you

[07:31]
for example in this case queen six you
could definitely
put it in a bigger sizing however um
if a deuce does run out and in the s3 or
something
yeah we could sometimes make him fold
the worst straight draw which we don't
really want

[07:45]
really want
and i actually went for a triple block
which actually i think is a very good
line basically
you are saying that you're still
representing a quite wide variety of
hands
and you are acknowledging the fact that
the imposition could have some strong
hands of good have made some strong

[08:01]
hands of good have made some strong
strong hands that you don't have um and
from here
i think he's going to raise quite them
for value from there you could maybe go
over the top so
as a strategy i think it works quite
well
however he did in this case have deuces

[08:17]
however he did in this case have deuces
and now you can say okay yeah yeah you
only bet it one third of the time
obviously he's gonna call deuces but
you're kind of targeting a different
part of his range let's say yeah then
like aced line yeah i'm targeting those
type of hands to fold
remember kind of math for basics

[08:32]
remember kind of math for basics
uh i'm only betting one third of the pot
okay or even yeah one third of the pot
or a quarter of the pot so it doesn't
have to work that often
so a kind of a different type of triple
barrel than the previous but i think
definitely an

[08:45]
definitely an
important move to have in your
repertoire
um the sherlock back limitless in the
house
limit is limping in we have the queen
three off we decide to check

[09:01]
three off we decide to check
765 limited checks it's a little bit
similar as a hand that we played earlier
only this time the board is a little bit
higher um favoring us a little bit less
but we're still gonna come out betting i
decide to bet here with the queen three

[09:15]
decide to bet here with the queen three
and limitless cause you should be
careful when you're when you're the big
blind here that you're not
overdoing it with all these hands so you
could use an rng depending on how good
your opponent
is uh basically the battery is the more
you have to be careful

[09:30]
you have to be careful
in terms of not putting all your bluffs
in the bedding line especially your
lower equity lanes like queen three
you could also just decide to always bat
queen four and never back to queen creed
that's also an option
so the turn is a jack we do have a club
in general good

[09:45]
in general good
to barrel as if a club hits you uh get a
little bit more fault equity as it's
less likely that you're a villain that
that your opponent made a flush
we can still bet quite thin here for
value
so i like my sizing and on the river

[10:00]
so i like my sizing and on the river
it's quite similar as the other
scenario where the board paris and
basically now i'm
most probably not value betting a seven
anymore so i'm basically going
six plus and therefore i'm going to use
a bigger sizing and actually just like
in the other hand
here we did that more money-wise but in

[10:16]
here we did that more money-wise but in
terms of a
one wise i think here to up the pressure
a little bit more
i think i would have liked a bigger
sizing
but we did get it through guys we did
get a true win a nice 1.5 k
pop there um but again just like in the

[10:31]
pop there um but again just like in the
other scenario it's kind of
you have to understand when do we decide
to bat bigger here on the river
um
we open here with ace king get defended
here by the big blind

[10:46]
here by the big blind
uh high low low board given our
given the fact that we have a spade i
think it's an easy see bet
on the turn we turn sort of the not
flush draw and i think here
you should already kind of see it coming
we are basically blocking the nuts

[11:01]
we are basically blocking the nuts
uh i think after he calls we should
then utilize the fact that he cannot
have the nuts and we do that by betting
as big as possible
in this case getting our stack in okay
i think this is the way we can best use

[11:15]
i think this is the way we can best use
the lighter blockers if we're putting
our
uh we're putting this this villain here
in a very tough spot again i think
you shouldn't always jam all your hands
i think again it's a split
uh it's a split situation i think if we
have kings with a spade for example we
probably
still want to bet not sure if we want to
go this big so i think the

[11:31]
go this big so i think the
majority of bets will be maybe three
quarters and then if we have the nuts we
want to get it in
and if we have the nut blocker we want
to get it in so in this case i think
this is a good
example of a hand that we just want to
put our stack in

[11:45]
put our stack in
and he did fold again which is going to
happen quite often
as i stated given our blockers and
giving the fact that we're betting four
times but
another good example of a spot to triple

[12:03]
another good example of a spot to triple
is we get called here in the small blind
and the flop is 977.
now in general if you look at the small
blind calling range in this scenarios
it's not going to contain quite a lot of
7x
whereas if our button range is going to

[12:15]
whereas if our button range is going to
contain quite a lot of 7x as well
if for example it turns on 8 it's less
like it's not likely that he has
jacked 10 off and we do so these are
spots that the small blind calls
compared to the big blind calls
uh are definitely spots that a range
advantage could

[12:30]
advantage could
um could be created or is already
present and could only be
i would say that would only get bigger
depending on the run out
so i decided to start off with a wonder
bat and basically i already
kind of committed to triple barreling

[12:46]
kind of committed to triple barreling
especially we don't have a diamond which
is good as long as the
board doesn't contain the diamond
i bet turn uh you see a similar story i
think i
could over bet this hand uh for what
it's worth actually we're blocking also
7 8 suited which he could call

[13:01]
7 8 suited which he could call
a small percentage of the time he calls
and on the river as a king and basically
i'm now going to use the advantage of
seven that i have now as for sizing
again
i think we could have even went a little
bit bigger

[13:15]
bit bigger
um but i think the main takeaway of this
hand is
how it plays different than if the small
blade calls compared with the big band
calls in terms of the advantage
in the 7x and the advantage that we
might have on future straight
run out okay and therefore we can apply

[13:31]
run out okay and therefore we can apply
good pressure
queen jack we open the button get caught
by the big blind a7 deuce
i think this hand should probably check
but we're looking at triple barrel so i
probably did
bet yes i did in the bed similar as a

[13:47]
bet yes i did in the bed similar as a
spot i think we discussed earlier
i think this is going a little bit out
of line i think the jack 10 should again
be the c
bet if i did decide to bet though
um i think using your jack blocker

[14:01]
um i think using your jack blocker
in terms of blocking ace jack a screen
blocker for what it's worth if he did
call
his queen probably will check raise that
some of the time that's why i think
check 10
or headlight 910 is a way more favorable
hand to see that and barrel than queen
jack

[14:15]
jack
and basically if we don't really have a
nice barrel here with queen jack
i think we should just go back one
street and not even see bet it
i think that would be the correct
solution but we did actually decide to
barrel
and we now decided to just go all the
way we didn't use a very big sizing as

[14:31]
way we didn't use a very big sizing as
we are kind of trying to represent that
we're still value betting maybe hand
like a stem plus
whereas if we would go really big let's
say we about three times the pot and he
hasn't had like a six
he might consider that or h5 he might
consider that

[14:45]
consider that
like a very good bluff catcher as we are
not value betting had like ace 10
anymore
and he's blocking at like five six so i
think ahead like h5 for example has a
harder time calling 819
then possibly a two and a half time pot
bet so
i think uh if i did decide the better

[15:02]
i think uh if i did decide the better
thing this is good sizing for this exact
holding
but in general like i said i don't
really like the flop pad that much
he did call and he had two pair which
yeah it's not really a hand that we're
expecting to fold so this is also

[15:16]
expecting to fold so this is also
actually a very important
lesson if you are bluffing if your
opponent calls you with a hand
that is a standard call or a very strong
strong hand
you don't have to feel bad about your
bluff right you only have to feel bad
about your bluff when your opponent

[15:30]
about your bluff when your opponent
calls you with a hand that
you expected him to fault then you
should maybe reconsider your bluff
okay and even then you don't know if he
calls it 100 of the time
um but i do do feel like
um that is a good thing to look out for

[15:45]
um that is a good thing to look out for
okay if i want
to make him fault for example i'm like
seven five and he calls here with seven
five i'll be like hmm interesting um
maybe i shouldn't have triple barrel to
jack queen here versus this opponent
i hope you guys uh liked this video

[16:01]
i hope you guys uh liked this video
give you a little bit of an insight
about some spots that you could triple
barrel
if you did remember give it a thumbs up
if you have any questions leave them
down below
have a lot of fun triple barrelling as
always poker ambition cannot be held

[16:16]
always poker ambition cannot be held
responsible for any triple barrels that
have gone wrong
so do take that in consideration before
you're investing your money in the river
and i wish you guys a lot of luck
barreling and good luck at the tables in
general
see you in the next video
