i actually do think this is a good point
to now just try to get the money in
and ops queens or kings or
some flush draw
and not jax
queens okay
fair
that's a good scenario
that's also a good run out

oh way of force my policy is usually
be a bit careful with deuces trees force
and then go bumbles with fives
but you know
for the for the stream
for the stream guys for the stream we
try to flop a set
so now what do we do what do you do when
you have a set the last tip i have for
you is on small pocket pairs
and these are hands that you can win
monster pods so when you get delta
pocket pair try to flop a set
play it smooth and win all the money
whatever set
actually check called
that was my
strategy here
it's interesting because i called from
the small blind
i think on the river we should probably
just bet
i think betting seems like
the thing to do
and i was hoping to get called by uh
bucket queens [ __ ] jax
as i can have five six suited five for
suited six seven suited maybe uh a
counterfeited pocket sevens or something
i don't know if i had to squeeze that
on the bb i would have just squeezed but
yeah
now i'm not so sure
okay another table starting no not at it
oh
it's a bad river
shall we cooler this guy
no i'm gonna go for the for the trappy
move
so
dance i don't think it's in his range
jacks
probably also not
actually i don't mind just ripping it in
here now we don't block
flush off we do block ajax suited which
is not great
i actually do think this is a good point
to now just try to get the money in
and obs queens or kings or
some flush draw
and not jax
queens okay
fair
that's a good scenario
and that's also a good run out what can
you do poker 3 is not really a board i'm
gonna see that all that often
but hey when you have a set
you should go for it
actually a spot there on the turn that
people
tend to over over
to over over betsy beth over over betsy
battle i said it correctly
i'm gonna leave it for the river
wow he timed
i'm not talking about oh [ __ ] i ran out
of time right there that's not good what
did i do i checked yes i checked
oh he called
thank you very much sir
that's very much appreciated
very much appreciate it give it to me
baby
give me [ __ ] what the [ __ ]
yeah yeah position that looks more like
the reason that's right disrespect
exactly
two years ago when play five another
zuma asked netherland players why you
guys use the same open size he said we
have the same teacher
good chance that that was me
this interesting turn
i'm gonna check do something funky
guys if i can play a hand funky on
stream
you know we can't help ourselves right
uh he fires 98
of the pot he was like i'm gonna go pot
but you know the wacko dutch greedy
[ __ ]
let's give the guy a little discount
lure him in well i'm in buddy
it's not the greatest of rivers i would
say
i am going to lead though
i'm gonna go for a little donkey donkey
which is again also a little bit funky
defaults okay does 88 have tougher poo
after poker stars
it's donkey donkey time people yes yes
yes we made a little donkey donkey
do me as donkey donkey maybe maybe jack
10 is a little bit better
i think if i river jack then i don't
mind the donkey donkey this one is maybe
a little bit uh
a little bit dicey
tents good sometimes four but
i'm going to go for the call
we have good tense
which means i block king 10 suited so
good tense
and we don't block a flush draw which is
good
so good tense definitely continuing
but it's a spot that i would definitely
have to do overfolding
start with a call
and to feel like this is an okay yeah it
kind of goes out of both ways but i
think it's an okay spot to call twice
okay he uses very small
small turn sign is interesting
i think it's correct strategy should
just be
i fold a lot on the flop
and therefore you should now maybe slow
down a little bit
but hey
who am i
nines
triple one turning in position
so he could have a yolo
but the yolo is usually on the lower
side so like five four five six then now
the pair would probably just check
have an ace high but ace high is quite a
poor barrel rule
as i will fold a lot of my a size on the
river
the most logical bluffs would be
something with a tent so yeah
i guess well played
but no other than that i don't have any
television history that i know of
might have seen me on some porn sites
though
i'm just joking guys they were they were
for more like is it is he serious
here versus space ace i'm gonna start
with a check he has shown some
aggression if we give him some room so
let's just give him some room and see if
he does something funky
let's go for the twenty percent
yet seven eight okay
so he's a one-time stabber i said i was
considering like turning o could even
lead because he will connect a lot
but sometimes you know that they just
also
barrel oh well
how but we didn't win
how do we not win on that board
sweden hero in the mix guys he starts
out with a little bit
as sweden hero has just such a high
random factor i think just calling his
best
and we get four bet here we call
it's not a good flop
checks now river is interesting i think
on the river i'm just gonna bet big and
hope he has a piece of the board and he
pays
i already know what his calling
tendencies are
we call this one
i'm gonna check raise
check our da7
okay turn
deuce makes us a straight and a 6 makes
us a straight
we cannot really fault for that amount
maybe we can bluff spades
i don't mind actually buffing spades
here sweden hero leads out let's see
what that means i'm going to make a
small race
here we can still sometimes win a
showdown so let's go
here because people are complaining i
don't use the pop button i decided to
use the pod button
it's quite interesting
so with dicey as obviously we have a
queen and an ace so usually not really
the cataract is of a hand that you want
to be value betting but we don't have
the aids of hearts i guess he could have
the ace of hearts
i don't want it to check back you want
to have a better understanding of what's

that's mr clinton big blind
clanty clanty what you gonna do what you
gonna do
when i have to bear
for the french people hey sweden hero
came to play another table
well
we're definitely in sir
five six suited
ah pain in my heart pain in my heart
nitty fault chicken song for me guys
chicken something
there's just days where i cannot seem to
follow suit attempt hand also get jacks
now jacks
we make a four bet we get a call so
we're playing two four by pots already
and we get aces what the [ __ ] is going
on
oh the
jacks are gonna be quartering it up
again
i'm trying to keep it in the in the
table
the aces we're gonna make a small c bet
jax we have a cold one we have an
eastern that is not good at
is what they call
a not so very favorable turn
you can do actually a range of things
now
go for the check
actually don't mind barreling 10 that
this is definitely a thing here
ace is obviously barreling
and now we face a small bet on the river
this is really annoying
it's gonna be quite hard for him to show
but bluffs i think he would have to
probably bluff
something this hand is also really
annoying the aces how the board ran out
nine stands jacks
i think doesn't really have much queens
nity check here
pocket six is dude what the [ __ ] are you
doing
uh
jax yeah jax yeah the 98 suited the
seven eight suited or maybe i thought
even the king queen suited
but i wasn't really sure if you would
bluff that
as is blocking kings and queens which is
going to be my main check back
check back turn
and
the side river type of holdings
the 89 suited shouldn't be in there a
lot of people make a mistake i don't
know what the pocket 6's hand was doing
oh that's a good hand
come on sweden
yeah a little forbid he's tired he lost
the ace deuce yeah a little format ha
we got sweden exactly where we want him
let's put on the poker face
i call
not a great board
but we've seen mr sweden hero do some
weird stuff that was yesterday though
today he's been a little bit quiet
he goes to the ten percent fan of the
stream shout out to this guy guys ten
percent
a barrel air of sweden
okay we got an interesting river in the
below table
i'm gonna call down here
i hope sweden hero didn't
[ __ ] jax or a queen
no pocket kings how weird he was just
unlucky from the start
this guy has been very unfortunate
against us so i think there's a very
legit chance he's gonna go on complete
monkeytails right now
that's the only thing that the only way
i can explain that his stats weren't
that crazy
and we saw him do some
really crazy stuff in yesterday's stream
and then there was this one huh
quite a dicey turn coleman
queen's kings asus is jacking jack
about my bloss
it does our ace five the thing is
he might have enough equity on the turn
but he cannot maneuver rivers i think in
order to call this hand
just
there's no flush draws yeah i don't know
i don't know
