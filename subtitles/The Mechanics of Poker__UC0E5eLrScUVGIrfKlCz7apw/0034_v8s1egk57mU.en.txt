welcome back guys to another edition
of the weko show on air
hello and chat my first live
all right we got a virgin in the chat
guys we got a virgin in chat missing no
question
first time ever live
someone has been asking for graph i will
help him with
results
and we get straight over boat
unfortunately almost done tomorrow
exhale start recording
prepared everything made all the
made all the sheets prepared all the
sims and tomorrow actually i'll start
making the first recording actually the
first master class
playing three webparts out of position
it's a tough spot for
a lot of people including me actually
that's actually why i decided to start
there
interesting spot there i called because
there's a recreational behind me
uh he will probably squeeze maybe a
little bit more linear
this is an interesting spot i think if
he jams the turn i'm just gonna
fold worse best case scenario you know
like okay versus this sizing i probably
still have to call as it's more likely
that he will have ace king as well maybe
he's still bad's hand like king queen
now if dennis falls i have to call i
guess with 20
hope he has king queen if he hasn't had
like jack 10 or something you know yeah
we still have some out so let's hope for
it
hey at seven nine gg he's
like he's in the tough spot with ace
king um
me not so much given the puddles already
in the pot
but this is kind of what i said right i
called just to let the guy
get in with some random hand fortunately
had 79 suited which obviously
doesn't play that well versus ace king
off but in general recreationals they
will also overcall with a standoff king
jack off
and obviously those are hands that play
well
and we flop a set which is usually
usually decent usually a decent hand to
make some moment the money weight guys
[Music]
um
okay okay gg he got there if you see for
example a solver and it tells you that
you're not allowed
to do something or you know you should
have a certain
betting frequency uh
while i play this hand
if it's because of your range it matters
a little bit less but if it's due to
someone else's range containing just a
lot of good hands and therefore you have
to slow down
you know it's usually uh it's usually a
good idea to
to go with those rules all right guys
first
first all in are we gonna hold twice
god this is a good start
[Music]
started with a little seabed here with
the ace king not doing a lot of betting
in these positions but i think this is
actually a spot where i can still do
quite a lot of betting and on the other
table actually we have an interesting
situation
i'm gonna cover it sevens because this
guy is quite crazy
and we're quite deep and he falls here
with the ace king
but in general i'm not gonna be doing
quite a lot of betting here i position
but
this is just a spot where uh i have
i have the most advantage now um and in
the future
so i'll do some betting i think ace king
sounds like a decent candidate
on the turn actually i followed it up
with another small bat
which i think is a nice play
how many play hands did you play online
lifetime 2-3 million
yeah probably i would say somewhere
around those region
while we face a bat check bet here
from our friend napsup
i'm gonna throw out a little check raise
here
i think this is a good candidate for
some obvious reasons
and that reason being the ace of spades
the eight is the eight relevant in some
way i don't really think so i think six
eight is probably barreling the turn but
for example i think it's good to not
have a
ten or something ace ten because he
could have
probably probably opens a little bit
more 10x than 8x that he would love the
river with so
i mean who feels me who has seen
the fun player turnover pocket deuces
there
i've seen it okay this is quite a strong
hand
as we have two sixes and there's four
four six
so let's slow play this
and make a little blocky blocky on the
river
expect him to raise a decent 10 himself
maybe do some bluff races
oh it's very unlikely guys it's very
unlikely but he actually had the other
six
if another six would have hit then we
would have had called pokestar support
because that's not even possible
but now you need to ask jinspoker if you
need hooker advice
the wacko is too handsome to know thank
you very much sir
good job good job i mean jenna all right
he knows more about bangkok taiwan or
where does the guy live
there's a little tree right here with
the pocket fives gotta see your flop
gonna turn a goddamn set that's what i'm
gonna do
that's what i'm gonna do
[Music]
oh yeah oh yeah
not gonna do any check raising on this
board so i'm
just gonna check
come on put some pressure my friend i
didn't put the pressure
then i tried to trap him on the river
and he didn't bite ace queen
i had two sevens actually i heard in rio
they closed the beach
and if they close the beach in rio de ja
might as well not go why would you're a
little donkey donkey here
on the 674 i like it
and he falls because he knew we were
balanced
just kidding mr human just kidding my
friend
flop a little trip trip trip kings
strip kings is a good hand he starts off
with a one third c bet
go for a little check race i think
will i no i won't
ha i was kidding guys just kidding i was
even kidding myself you saw
cps is top 10 from current active high
stakers
i think orange was already confirmed by
the way a crusher
tech crash shot slash high staker slash
so that was actually no longer a
surprise
okay so we face a barrel from the top 10
player in
z world or just in high sex poker i
guess
and we're just gonna make a little
caller on the turn
shall we trip at the baron guys no i'm
not going to attribute the baron
i'm going to expand the three betting
range but against the baron
goes for the half pot okay okay
i'm gonna go for a check race
and he's going to turn over king 10 guys
oh he was just kidding he was just
kidding what a fun guy this lucas evp
he was just kidding
okay we get a flop check
it's actually quite a good board for him
don't really see a reason why he would
start checking
i think we talked about this before
right usually when that happens i
approach
it a little bit carefully i'm gonna try
a little trick right here with the baron
because we ain't giving [ __ ]
and he falls what a play
what a play guys he checks again we
check check check check check
i have a feeling i'm up against ace king
he thinks about it for a very long time
i think if he had a worse king he would
have just slipped at the flop like king
jack king 10.
so he's either is trapping me or he has
the same hand
so i see no point in raising
throw all of that out of the window guys
throw all of that out of the window
let me know what you guys think i think
it's it's a fine play i think
my mistake is then to not raise the
river
make a little bet here with the king ape
show some check race inductions yeah we
haven't really seen much check raised
inductions it's true
we got race which is not the problem at
all guys it's not a problem
should we draw the bad guys i'm gonna
throw out a bat
why do you think a crusher like linus
was struggling at 200 l before he
started to use solvers
i mean the only logical reason i could
think of he had a certain approach to
the game that wasn't working apparently
started to look at solvers he saw the
solver doing some things he saw certain
patterns coming back in that
wow in the meanwhile casually you flop a
set so he started to see like a couple
of patterns
and from there he
maybe started to see some patterns hey i
usually play my hand like this
the solver doesn't play the hand like
this et cetera et cetera and from there
you started to make like some
adjustments
i think that is like the most likely
of things
while i draw a little a little check
raise here
with z pocket fives
does gluca still play tournaments
in turn is a probably a range check
and here i'm gonna check funky funky
so
and here we actually face a bet with the
pocket vice we're gonna check call here
on the river we decided to make a little
blocky blocky
and we have the worst river ever six so
now let's hope he has seven eight and
give up
one time and here on the river we got
called by king jack
he bets again and we have quite a bad
hand now
okay okay my friend you win you win like
a little delay sieben
king 10 king 10 king 10 fresh in my mind
man fresh in my mind i'm going to go
back
king 10 king 10 king 10 kington
king 10 king 10 kingdom
queen 10 rule the four so we're gonna
over bet
any snap calls he also has a queen that
seems very unlucky my friend
that's a good term
actually ice cream probably better check
in hindsight
is king age jack definitely betting it's
probably a mistake
and there you go check raised oh let's
tag along
at least one
and that is the nuts
thank you he's gonna block i'm gonna jam
happy life
which sick human being would bluff here
he made a flush okay gg
like a little trivet here with the ace
king we flop two pair here
life is good guys see where the floppy
days can take down
what was set a set ain't bad
already there first
is the late seabed we're gonna call
make a little donkey donkey on the river
let's see what he thinks of that
he throws a little race okay let's go my
friend
let's go let's pump it up
