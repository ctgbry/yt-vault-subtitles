[00:00]
um
yeah a jack or
a flush
i think those are probably now his most
likely holdings
and triple ain't giving [ __ ] okay

hi there fellow poker friends and
welcome to an episode of high stakes
heroes in which we are going to be
sweating some high stakes poker
the player who we're going to be

[00:30]
the player who we're going to be
sweating today is the new polish
superstar triple yes it's not only the
limitless who is the polish superstar
but maybe we got a new contender for the
title
sitting here with a nice 10k dollar
stack after battling it out on the 2k

[00:46]
stack after battling it out on the 2k
tables
if you liked this video do remember to
give this video a thumbs up let me know
in the comments down below if you played
any hands any different and without
further ado let's get into the first
hand

[01:01]
so our hero is on the button raising it
up to tune off axe which is probably the
most common size in cash games
gus gore the german superstar three bets
from the small blind and triple decides
to make a four bet so far everything

[01:17]
to make a four bet so far everything
seems quite standard goose core calls
this is gonna be a quite frequent
situation in your
six-handed cash game
flop comes dues do seven
let's see if someone played the seven

[01:30]
let's see if someone played the seven
deuce maybe triple also places seven
juice just like limitless
he goes for a small c bet of around
20 25 pot seems like quite a gto sizing
so far
now it's up to goose core and goose core
actually just ships in his stack which

[01:46]
actually just ships in his stack which
is actually quite an interesting play i
think the preferred sizing here
probably i would
recommend a smaller sizing something
like 400 450
not really much bigger than 500 i would

[02:02]
not really much bigger than 500 i would
say
as it's quite hard to have a lot of plus
in display like you're not going to do
this with a hand like 9 10 off spades
for example i guess i guess you could
but i think the benefit of raising
smaller hair and goose core shoes is

[02:16]
smaller hair and goose core shoes is
just that we can add more bluffs and
then basically let's say we have like
7-6 suited which is very small and then
if he gets it in you know gg we're gonna
see a turn it's quite quite uh actually
one thing else to consider on these
power boards if you have a hand like

[02:30]
power boards if you have a hand like
normally if it's like deuce three seven
and they have like seven six suited i
think just check raising small getting
it in with this low spr it's quite a
good play when the board is paired
though your seven six suited is worth a
little less and i had like sixes with a
club or something here goes up in value

[02:46]
club or something here goes up in value
so something to take in consideration so
goose cord does actually go for the gem
i think in a vacuum
he's probably going to have
i would say
a pair or a flush draw that's kind of
his most likely holding

[03:01]
his most likely holding
i think triple here
basically
good score's jam cannot really be bad it
cannot really be minus ev if he has like
a flush draw or a pair uh just given the
ranges and how much money is already in
the pot but we're trying to make the
most the highest ev decision and trying

[03:16]
most the highest ev decision and trying
to play the highest ev strategy so
i would say for him that's probably
raising a little bit smaller and then
for triple now i think he has quite an
easy call with
basically any ace king that doesn't
block a flush

[03:31]
block a flush
actually it goes both ways right if he
has a club he has more equity versus he
had like seven six or seven eight suited
or eights or nines so i guess he's just
gonna bad call all his
ace king and that call his better paris
i would say that's probably strategy he

[03:45]
i would say that's probably strategy he
calls
and we have a showdown and gus gore is
in deep trouble guys
triple has him completely dominated here
with the a3 and gus gore shows up with a
hand that we kind of expected him to
have right
um and for triple i think yeah he has

[04:00]
um and for triple i think yeah he has
quite an okay hand to just i think
batsman on the flop turn is quite
interesting is probably going to be a
check i would say
um
or you could consider jamming on a blank
turn um maybe for make goose core fold
like some ace jack some ace queen i

[04:16]
like some ace jack some ace queen i
think that's a fine strategy i think
blue skirt that shouldn't really have
much flush draws on the turn and the
flush draws that he might have like king
queen of clubs are probably still
calling versus gem so i think bat
betting and triple shoes probably the
right play

[04:32]
and triple wins both the pot so that's
that's how he makes money guys a nice
healthy 12k stack there right in the
first
hand mr tripple opens again on the
button agl buy

[04:46]
button agl buy
very
also a good high six rex
playing with mr helmets from estonia
also a good high stakes irregular so
tough game if you see a flop before do
seven triple opened on the bottom we
have big which i think is uh a good

[05:01]
have big which i think is uh a good
sizing on this texture
as it i mean you're you're you have
quite a big equity advantage so you can
put a lot of money in the pot
um it can boost like some equity denial
let's say we have a hand like nice knees
king jack off he probably has to fold so

[05:16]
king jack off he probably has to fold so
i think it's a good strategy
speaking about the king jack so if we
have eights now it's probably still the
best hand triple goes for an over bat
which i think he's probably gonna have a
mix i would say on this turn um

[05:30]
mix i would say on this turn um
of like three quarter bats and over bats
so so far i don't think there is very
much for us to say
agl calls
we can still have quite a range of hands
the jack is just in general a very
favorable card after we better pick on
the flop

[05:46]
the flop
because
basically we still have like hands like
910 jack 10 jack queen whereas agl
probably has already folded those hands
so we can just in general have a high
betting frequency in these kind of turns
river is the queen of spades agl checks
oh no wait he didn't

[06:01]
oh no wait he didn't
agl
front jammed the river
quite an interesting play
[Music]
um
as i would say triple probably is the
person who has most flush draws in his
range

[06:16]
basically agl is saying that he has the
nut flush like a 7x a flush
but we we have to try to find like some
bluffs here right what can ajl be
bluffing with
i think

[06:31]
the
most obvious candidate would be maybe
ace five with the ace of spades
i think ace 10 with the ace of spades is
probably just folding the turn
ace 4 with the ace of spades is an

[06:45]
ace 4 with the ace of spades is an
option but has some showdown value
even though probably versus aggressive
player yeah if you check
i don't think we can can we call no in
if he if he bats
like he can have 910
i
maybe versus a very aggressive player if

[07:00]
maybe versus a very aggressive player if
you have ace four with the asus bass i
think check calling river isn't
necessarily bad because i think it is a
possible over bluff spot actually i
think we reviewed a similar spot
uh in my bluff catching episode so if
you haven't checked seen that one check

[07:15]
you haven't checked seen that one check
that out
so triple
actually
mocks and shows a five and this is kind
of what i was saying right like i
wouldn't be surprised if people
especially more aggressive players just
show up with a hand like king five of
clubs here i would definitely not be

[07:31]
clubs here i would definitely not be
surprised so i don't really see the
merits of
jamming with the strong hands i also
think triple is still going to be value
betting
on the thinner side so if he has kings
aces river queen he's probably still

[07:45]
aces river queen he's probably still
value betting
[Music]
so yeah i don't really see the point in
bluffing i don't really see much bluffs
i also don't really see the point but in
the same time also don't really see the
point of value jamming a strong hand
if i could guess i would say this is

[08:00]
if i could guess i would say this is
probably more likely to be a strong hand
just like a seven axis paid that is
afraid that a queen or an overbear
without a spade is checking behind
so
i think it's a good fault i don't know
what his other card is of course
probably he has like
five six or something so good for by mr

[08:16]
five six or something so good for by mr
triple creative play here by mr agl
we are in the small blind this hand and
we open agl calls
flop comes monotone it's a bit on the

[08:30]
flop comes monotone it's a bit on the
lower side
usually like lower boards blind versus
blind it will connect a little bit
better with the big blind than with the
small blind also kind of depends i don't
know i think he's playing a race only
strategy from what i've seen so far uh
for example i like to play a mix then
mono boards in general when i limp a lot

[08:46]
mono boards in general when i limp a lot
of my off suit hands will be in the
limco range so mono boards do very bad
but i think
uh he could still do some betting
smaller sizings are usually recommended
on motherboards as
if we start to bed very big basically a

[09:01]
if we start to bed very big basically a
spade kind of kills us
you know the board is going to change a
lot so we usually prefer to bet smaller
sizes and this is exactly what our hero
does
he blocks the turn again this way he can

[09:15]
he blocks the turn again this way he can
bet a very right variety of hands so so
far i like it he's he's gonna force agl
to defend quite white which is going to
be hard to do as he's already in a wide
spot
in this way he can basically bluff let's
say he has like eight nine suited or

[09:31]
say he has like eight nine suited or
something i think it's a fine hand to
play this way so
far on the river he bets 227 so more a
little you could say a little bit more
of a polarizing um bet however i don't
think so basically if he had had like

[09:45]
think so basically if he had had like
eight nine stands they're definitely
worth its this sizing
um
don't think he's batting fives and sixes
anymore i think he could again split his
range here on the river
uh i think this sizing could be like

[10:00]
uh i think this sizing could be like
some reserved for really something
particular i personally would probably
prefer to just do a lot of blocking
again
uh
as i think
um actually i think this this

[10:17]
um actually i think this this
this is fine is your calls depending on
his hands of course he actually shows up
with the nut flush
[Music]
which
yeah i think is is is a fine play he

[10:30]
yeah i think is is is a fine play he
could maybe consider
like basically 758 dollar went in the
pot
maybe he could have used a bigger sizing
at some point but then again you know
you also don't really want to scare away
and like 9 10 with a spade
um

[10:45]
um
so yeah i think
hard to get a lot of value with this
hand also when the board parrots it's
not like he has a nuts i think if the
river is like
maybe
a queen or a jack or something you maybe
could consider check raising the river i

[11:01]
could consider check raising the river i
think that's a fine play as well
basically when you have the nuts you
know you're trying you're trying to get
yourself in a spot where you can get
your stack in and that's just not going
to happen real often i don't think agl
is going to find a lot of blood rays
here on the river
as we already have the nut flush

[11:21]
we're in the big blind agel opens we
three bet from the big blind
and we face a format we call
seven three eight

[11:31]
seven three eight
check agl bats so far quite standard he
goes for like a little like a thirty two
percent sizing just like in the early
end i think this is fine
and triple again goes for the gem i do
think actually the the

[11:46]
think actually the the
stacks are a little yeah he went to 480
the pot is a little bit bigger than in
the last hand
and agile does and triple just rips it
in i think a very big difference on this
board compared to the other board that
let's say triple has a hand like nines

[12:00]
let's say triple has a hand like nines
or tens or jacks here um he can actually
get called by quite a lot of worse hands
so i had like king it suited for example
i had like 87 suited which usually if
there's more hands that villain can call
you with you can increase your sizing so
in this spot i think jamming makes a

[12:16]
in this spot i think jamming makes a
little bit more sense in the other spot
and agl folded i think in general a good
aggressive play with basically any two
parts that kind of connect in this
region i would say

[12:33]
raise a small blind
get treated by the big blind we're
playing some very deep stack poker here
we're already over 300 big man's deep so
this can get quite interesting
963 i think it's a board that still

[12:47]
963 i think it's a board that still
favors helmets quite a lot he probably
doesn't have threes and sixes
six is maybe at some frequency the ninth
i think is quite fair he bets half pot
which so far seems good gets a call
turn is a six

[13:01]
turn is a six
doesn't really change that much some
people you see now leading on this turn
triple decided not to
but he actually decided to go for the
jack race aggressive guy aggressive guy
this triple
and helmets decides to tag along all

[13:17]
and helmets decides to tag along all
right i think
triple here it's
maybe if he has like a hand like 10 8
suited or something
that he didn't really want to check
raise the flop width as it's not a very
high equity and i think he could do this

[13:30]
high equity and i think he could do this
this with maybe
like a hand like jack queen clubs i
think is a fine candidate obviously six
would definitely be nice as well um
maybe like a lower or lower hand like
five four of spades or something is fine

[13:47]
five four of spades or something is fine
so yeah so far
that's kind of i think how his range
looks
river is the king of clubs which is
quite interesting as helmets now
improves to kings
triple i don't think like i said has

[14:00]
triple i don't think like i said has
i don't think he said i think he
definitely still has some flash draws i
think if he hadn't like ten eight or
five four um i think he should
definitely be bluffing especially the
five four blocking like some maybe like
some six five of spades
um and i think you definitely still want

[14:16]
um and i think you definitely still want
to be betting your six
i
definitely so i would like to find a
sizing that i can still value better six
um
so
the king is also quite a scarecrow right
if he had queens or jacks uh he's now in

[14:32]
if he had queens or jacks uh he's now in
some trouble
and
so i don't think he's going to call a
very big bet so if i was triple here i
would probably come up with a small
sizing let's say 1200 or something i
think that's
that is a fine bet

[14:45]
that is a fine bet
and kind of reserve my gems for
if i have a very strong hand so like the
nut flush
and i'm trying to actually now think
blood i think in terms of bluffs
probably maybe in gto we would check
race i had like ace club
jack space or something on the turn some

[15:01]
jack space or something on the turn some
percentage of the time to have some
bluffs on these kind of rivers but i
think in general i don't think we have
much of those bluffs so then
uh i think just coming up with a small
size me on the river is probably good

[15:15]
but he actually checks and helmets
checks behind he actually shows up with
the 76 which i'm not really a big fan of
i think he should definitely be betting
the river
maybe he was a little bit afraid of the
flush uh but i think the right response
um

[15:30]
um
should just be too bad like 1200 i mean
he still has a lot of worse hands that
can call you with you still have quite a
lot of bluffs and you also have like you
have a lot of blocks that don't really
want to bet too big as we're not
blocking any aces kings any flushes like
five four spades for example or like

[15:45]
five four spades for example or like
1080 spades i think those hands
uh do well in a smaller sizing so i'm
not really sure why you checked
let me know what you guys think
what would you have done on the river
would you have just be like [ __ ] it he
doesn't have a flush i'll throw my stack

[16:00]
doesn't have a flush i'll throw my stack
in would you have bad small would you
have also checked
let us know in the comments down below
we open the button
mr helmuts
[Music]

[16:15]
[Music]
has the big stack right now with a nice
little 10k dollar
we see that one third sexy abort that i
think population is oversea betting a
little bit so some free advice here
definitely a spot to do check race

[16:30]
definitely a spot to do check race
helmets obviously already knew that so
he's gonna go for the check race
and the triple defense so far you know
both ranges are still quite white uh i
think good hands for helmets here to be
checked raising our hands maybe like a
seven with a club ace five with a club

[16:45]
seven with a club ace five with a club
obviously like some direct good flush
draws maybe like some open enders
maybe had like deuces with a club
wouldn't be surprised if that happens a
very small percentage of the time but i
think mainly draws
and like your a side with your backdoors

[17:01]
and like your a side with your backdoors
ace four h5 a7 maybe ace nine even but
probably a little bit less
so there's a four which is a good
turn
i would say for four helmets he bats

[17:15]
i would say for four helmets he bats
three quarters
which
i think his range can probably bet
a little bit bigger i don't know how how
thin he wants to go here in terms of
king jacks
but in general on two gun board you
won't be doing that much check raising i
think with king tanking jack especially

[17:31]
think with king tanking jack especially
not without a club
we were did we actually start off the
hand a little bit deeper now right
yeah i i i would personally use a little
bit of a bigger sizing on a four
especially on like a deuce or something
you would probably go very polar but i

[17:46]
you would probably go very polar but i
think of four
i would probably go towards pot with my
betting range but he bets three quarters
which you know it's like whatever
triple calls
river is a jack
helmets now gems is stacking

[18:02]
helmets now gems is stacking
okay
so because we sized a little bit down in
the turn the river bat is like 1.5 x pot
whereas if we would have
followed the turn or maybe slightly over
bedded we would have just had pop behind
so now it's quite interesting we can

[18:15]
so now it's quite interesting we can
fold a little bit more if we are triple
blockers here kind of go both ways um
let's say for example we have a hand
like eight seven yes we're blocking the
seven five suited um but in the same
time you know we're also blocking hand
like a seven off suit so i don't think

[18:31]
like a seven off suit so i don't think
it's really a spot
where your blockers are gonna matter
that much uh obviously i wouldn't start
calling with a hand like pocket tents or
something that seems quite bad in
general i think having a king is
probably decent for example a hand like

[18:46]
probably decent for example a hand like
king queen here i think is a better
bluff catcher than i had like pocket
asus as with king queen you know we're
blocking king six king eight um
and with asus we are blocking some of
his bluffs maybe like a7 h5

[19:00]
his bluffs maybe like a7 h5
so
i would probably just look for calls in
my king axe
maybe a hand like eight
seven eight seven suited i guess you
could go but i think it's mainly just
gonna be your kings so you're king seven

[19:15]
gonna be your kings so you're king seven
your king five his prime candidates and
your king queens or you riverton king
jax
triple does call
and he had pocket kings
if one king is a good call then probably
two kings is a great call and

[19:30]
two kings is a great call and
helmets did indeed show up with a hand
that i think is quite gto until maybe
the river in general if you're bluffing
the river you don't really want to have
hands that villain is going to call call
fold so in this case think a hand that's
always bad calling calling turner

[19:45]
always bad calling calling turner
folding river is the is a club so like
ace deuce h3 h5 a7 h9 is 10 ace queen
so you know those are already like six
seven combos that we're basically
blocking the five i don't think
does that much
yeah king fight student is gonna call so

[20:01]
yeah king fight student is gonna call so
you have some blocker that five seven
suited he's gonna call so you have but i
think five seven suited is probably
raising the turn a fair amount
so you're not really blocking that so
i'm not really sure about helmets play
um i think he should just give up on the

[20:16]
um i think he should just give up on the
river and only jam
club but hey
our clown is gaining some money
[Music]
we open on the button agl calls
we see a flop of 6 jack 10 triple again

[20:31]
we see a flop of 6 jack 10 triple again
goes for a big bat which we have seen
him use now a couple of times he's
definitely mixing up his flop sizings i
think he has small and big so far which
i definitely like i think this is
definitely a board where you can have
big bets on

[20:45]
big bets on
agl check raises
which is not gonna happen and very high
frequency versus a bigger sizing on this
board
so i think he's already starting to
he probably has like age jack maybe king
jack suited those are probably his
weakest hands and then of course he has

[21:00]
weakest hands and then of course he has
the two past and the jack 10 the 10 6
suited the jack 6 suited
in terms of bluffs probably somewhere
around that region like the queen nines
the eight nines um
maybe like your 780 clubs i think these
are like

[21:15]
are like
i think the the bluffs are very natural
to find on this board unlike the other
board on the king was it the king six
eight
[Music]
our hero calls
and agl does go indeed for a more
polarizing sizing like i suggested

[21:31]
polarizing sizing like i suggested
helmut would have used in the other hand
which i like he that's very big
triple is calling i think here on the
turn triple still has quite a lot of
calls
if he has a very strong hand i think
it's a good time to to shove your stack

[21:47]
it's a good time to to shove your stack
in um
but apparent i think a lot of fans like
ace queen ace king king queen i think
are still quite okay cause

[22:00]
now the river is a jack
which is
i think quite
neutral
as
yes ajl probably only has i think when
he when he bets paul in the turn he

[22:15]
he when he bets paul in the turn he
probably doesn't have king jack suited
anymore um
ace jack off i guess is his worst jack
which
triple has obviously way more jacks but
triple also has ace king ace queen king
queen so percentage-wise the total
ranges if we look at how often uh both

[22:31]
ranges if we look at how often uh both
players have a jackax i think it's
pretty well divided
i think agl here should just
be jamming
his jackax his sixes
his 610 did get counterfeited

[22:47]
also in terms of trip i think triple
still has a lot of hands like queens
queens for example is probably a gem on
the turn same with kings
um ace is probably a call on the turn
with kings for example we're unblocking
and like uh ace jack so i think kings is

[23:01]
and like uh ace jack so i think kings is
a fine gem on the turns and queens so i
think triples range is mainly going to
be a skinking queen a screen maybe like
a six excess space then excess space
type of holding
uh 10x's page probably not very likely
in the flop sizing

[23:15]
in the flop sizing
so if i was agl i would definitely try
to follow through if i have a hand like
uh yeah like your straight draws
like i had like eight nine queen nine
basically eight nine would probably be

[23:30]
basically eight nine would probably be
my preferred bluff and then because if
we have queen nine it's less likely that
he is ace queen or king queen hence that
he's going to fault
um
agl actually
timed for a little while and decided to
check and he actually shows up with

[23:45]
check and he actually shows up with
what i think actually is a great
bluffing candidate we are blocking some
uh jackax which obviously used the big
sizing on the flop i'm not really sure
if he puts a hand like jack 9 suited in
there or jacket suited but i think it's
definitely fine in this board as we are
still getting called a lot by worse

[24:00]
still getting called a lot by worse
and triple he actually takes down the
nice 1.8 k pot with king queen
um
probably i would say misplayed by agl
and i think triple played his hand fine
not to bluff the river i think this is a
spot where people are a little bit

[24:15]
spot where people are a little bit
unbalanced on the river
you could say that king queen
should probably be jamming
in theory at least
but in practice i don't mind his check
[Music]
helmets opens the button we defend in

[24:31]
helmets opens the button we defend in
the big blind flock comes ajak 5 helmets
decide to go for a small bat and support
that you could approach in multiple ways
you can either think about very small
high percentage of the time or go for a
bit more polarizing sizing

[24:45]
bit more polarizing sizing
i think both strategies are fine i
personally like to use a bigger sizing
but the ajax 5 rainbow particularly i
would definitely also still have some
small sizing so so far so good
the jack again triple does not decide to

[25:00]
the jack again triple does not decide to
lead
which he also didn't earlier in the 6x
maybe this is not really part of his
strategy in general i think this is an
okay spot to lead don't think we have to
lead that small actually this i think is
an okay spot to lead a little bit polar
um

but still probably gonna have quite a
high checking frequency i mean if
helmets just bets range on this flop and
you call
i think it's a spot that people
tend to dunk too much okay so here here
i definitely don't mind

[25:30]
i definitely don't mind
helmets did indeed decide to bet again
he uses a pot sizing which i think is
fine this way you can still bet quite a
lot of strong ace acts add some jackax
into there so i don't mind it
triple calls
rivers of spade let's see if triple

[25:46]
rivers of spade let's see if triple
leads the river just like agl did no he
didn't
helmets actually goes now for the over
bed and now we're getting a little bit
more polarizing territories basically
helmets i don't think it's gonna be very
maybe maybe he fell he bets ace king a
screen with a spade that is an option

[26:01]
screen with a spade that is an option
definitely a skin with spade but that's
probably his weakest valley bets i think
now we're just gonna have to look at a
jack
yeah a jack or
a flush
i think those are probably now his most
likely holdings

[26:17]
likely holdings
and triple ain't giving [ __ ] okay
he raises 1.8 which is actually not
i mean in terms of money-wise it's it's
uh
it's a little bit it's an interesting
race size

[26:30]
race size
um
as
i think if he did have like the nuts
like ace jack for example uh i think a
bigger i think again you can have two
razors here i think ace jack probably
just wants to go big
100 sure here but

[26:46]
100 sure here but
um
he's basically saying that he still now
has the king i flushes the queen high
flushes
or actually a flush in general i would
say
well it's like the tiniest hand that he
can check raise maybe like a 10-5 of

[27:00]
can check raise maybe like a 10-5 of
spades i would say makes sort of sense
i don't know how low he will go in his
flushes though
but helmut does say that he still has
quite a lot of good jacks
um but i think probably like queen five
of spades king five of spades probably
the bottom range now of triple maybe

[27:16]
the bottom range now of triple maybe
even king five of spades only and then
just
boats
the more flushes he starts to track race
it becomes actually quite interesting
for helmets that if he has a hand like
jack queen with a spade or something
that he would now come over the top
actually probably without a spade would
be better so like a normal jack queen i

[27:32]
be better so like a normal jack queen i
think actually that would be a good play
will he do it though that is the
question
ah he folded a nice little pot here by
triple don't blame him i think it's
quite hard also for our hero triple in
this case to

[27:45]
this case to
to find a lot of bluffs here right what
would be a good bluff maybe hand like
king queen with the queen of spades uh
maybe it's probably better to have the
queen of spades
as he can still be very bad in ace king
with the king of spades he's probably
checking back a lot of king king access

[28:01]
checking back a lot of king king access
plates on the flop so i think king queen
with the queen of spades is probably a
good
hand to check race bluff on the river in
this kind of scenarios as well the three
pairs are usually good candidates so the
ace five in this case would be an okay
candidate to check race

[28:15]
candidate to check race
but in general i don't think
it's it's like our hero is going to be
showing up with a lot of blush here
open up the button
game became six-handed neomorph calls in
the big blind
with a little bit of a shortage stack so

[28:31]
with a little bit of a shortage stack so
we got the 10k versus the 700 bucks
not really a fair fight but let's see
queen 75 flop triple checks behind
neomorph checks again on the turn and
triple decides to go for a delay
um you sometimes see some players size

[28:46]
um you sometimes see some players size
down here
uh due to connectivity but i think this
port becomes now so connected that we
could sort of size up again
neomorph decides to go for the check
race like the delayed check race which i
think is a good place especially with
the stack size to just push a lot of

[29:00]
the stack size to just push a lot of
equity
triple is probably a little bit capped
and it's probably inclined to be betting
a lot of hands like 10's jacks maybe
like some wheat weak queen axe on the
turn which are all i think in quite a
nasty spot also given the stack size

[29:15]
nasty spot also given the stack size
uh so i don't mind
to push like some equity if i'm hearing
near more shoes probably you want to
have a hand with an eight in it and a
nine as triple it's probably not folding
eighths or ninths so maybe i had like
five eight suited
six eight suited would be fine

[29:31]
six eight suited would be fine
candidates i also actually don't mind it
if he does it with a hand like king
queen
i think it's fine we checked we let him
do the betting if we bet now he can play
quite perfectly i would say whereas if
we check his bats we kind of put him in
the tough scenario

[29:46]
the tough scenario
triple calls
river is a jack
now it's
[Music]
if you're a new move shoe share it's
it's going to be a little bit tricky
right i think if triple indeed at eight
or nines i think it's gonna be quite

[30:00]
or nines i think it's gonna be quite
hard to get him off him as they seem
like good primary bluffing candidates as
we're blocking the nuts in eight nine um
he might still have some flush draws but
i don't really see which ones
um so if i'm in new more shoes here i
would be a little bit careful

[30:17]
would be a little bit careful
yeah we definitely tend to be lean a
little bit more on the careful side you
just jam
which
i don't think he's gonna show up with a
lot of blush hair to be honest uh so if
i'm triple
i wouldn't be looking to hero call at a

[30:31]
i wouldn't be looking to hero call at a
high frequency
and he actually does show up with the
bluff and triple actually shows up with
the nuts okay not a great spot to bluff
with your neo morph if your opponent has
that has a nuts he doesn't have um

[30:45]
that has a nuts he doesn't have um
which is actually quite interesting that
he checked 89 on the flop it's i think
it's definitely a good play especially
when you get shorter you will get check
raised at a higher frequency and then he
just bats the turn all in for example
you cannot really continue anymore so
starting to check back some draws like

[31:00]
starting to check back some draws like
this when you get shallower i think is a
great play in terms of neomorph
he did have indeed a hand that can just
push equity i think
in his shoes
with his exact hand maybe just over

[31:15]
with his exact hand maybe just over
betting the turn is also an option
which i don't really mind
yeah actually maybe i prefer that over
check raising if i was in his shoes
but a nice little party for our hero

[31:32]
but a nice little party for our hero
helmets opened we're in a small blind
week three bat
helmets calls
we see a flop of jack 10 deuce i think
it's a flop that's definitely going to
be favoring this small blind it's a
rainbow board song i expect to

[31:45]
rainbow board song i expect to
triple to do a lot of sea betting here
probably you can simplify australia here
and go over a range c bet
he doesn't he checks and helmut decides
to check behind so it's quite
interesting what i guess his first check
would be a hand like pocket nines i

[32:00]
would be a hand like pocket nines i
guess
uh this deep i would probably also think
that pocket knights who pocket nine's
call sometimes it did not probably still
just three betting
so i would say nines then maybe a hand
like
yeah basically i can only think of nines

[32:15]
yeah basically i can only think of nines
and maybe i had like six seven of clubs
six seven of diamonds these kind of
holdings
i guess that's the that's what i would
say are the most frequent checks maybe
pocket jacks [ __ ] top sets never a
bad hand to be checking or maybe pocket
ten

[32:30]
ten
third is an ace which isn't that good
for pocket nine so let's see
triple checks
helmet checks again actually on the turn
it's uh it's it's quite interesting if
you're in helmet shoes okay what is he
checking to me twice
becomes quite interesting right now

[32:45]
becomes quite interesting right now
helmet should probably now start maybe
bluffing even with like some very
unnatural hands like maybe pocket fours
pocket fives some of the time to get
ahead like knights default
we are unblocking maybe his check faults
like six seven yes we beat six seven if

[33:00]
like six seven yes we beat six seven if
we have an end like pocket force but
then again if we check and six seven
bluffs us on the river we're not gonna
call or are we
no we're probably not
so it goes check check river is a king
so i actually have no clue anymore who
has what
uh don't think triple should be able to

[33:17]
uh don't think triple should be able to
win here with pocket nines if he did
have that
uh if he does indeed win with pocket
knights i think helmets somewhere made a
mistake in his range construction
triple checks again
helmet checks behind actually triple
shows up with the pocket kings which i

[33:31]
shows up with the pocket kings which i
actually find
quite interesting i don't know what he
was trying to do
basically check raising 200 bb deep
maybe already a little bit dicey the
board is rainbow though so i don't mind
it that much i guess that's what his
plan was to just check raise flop and

[33:46]
plan was to just check raise flop and
try to build a pot
which i mean if your opponent is
stabbing quite aggressively it's fine
right we're betting the flop to try to
get some money in so if he just stabs
very aggressive check raising seems an
okay strategy uh on the river i think
he's just now thinking like okay it's

[34:01]
he's just now thinking like okay it's
way more likely
that helmet just has nothing six seven
suited five four suited these type of
holdings maybe bucket trees fours fives
and it's more likely that i will get
bluffed and i will get hero called so i
think that's the reason why he checked

[34:15]
think that's the reason why he checked
the river but helmets didn't bite it
smelled a little bit funny right it
smelled already a little bit funny on
the flop on these boards where people
normally do a lot of betting if they
check we can quite narrow them down even
though i was completely off as he did
turn over the pocket kings which i
definitely did not expect

[34:31]
definitely did not expect
that's it for the hands from our polish
superstar mr triple the clown himself
if you liked the way he played his hands
give this video a thumbs up if you have
any suggestions for mr triple write them
down in the comments down below i'm sure

[34:46]
down in the comments down below i'm sure
