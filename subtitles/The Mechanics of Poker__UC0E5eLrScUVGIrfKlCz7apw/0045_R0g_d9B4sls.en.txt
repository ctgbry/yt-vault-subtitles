[00:00]
but i wouldn't actually be surprised
this hand sometimes re-raises
when he jams a river

[00:24]
me we have quite quite a good hand
you could say

[00:32]
i'm gonna fault
[Music]
do you want to know what is inside the

[00:45]
do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo yes
yes yes hello boys and girls
i will keep on saying girls because i
found out that there's actually

[01:01]
found out that there's actually
a female watching streams or at least
the youtube
got a comment that there's definitely
fee more interest in the stream so i'm
just gonna keep on greeting the females
as well
let's see about that this hand is
probably not going to become very
interesting

[01:16]
interesting
unless i make like a runner runner
straight
and a lot of money suddenly goes in
oh oh seven pet small
race jam [ __ ] my life

[01:32]
i have another check i think i'm just
gonna check again with this hand
sevens i might bet or something there's
an eight or something
there's a half pots even here definitely

[01:45]
there's a half pots even here definitely
calling actually i don't have any time
bank there
here we face an over bet so the hand
actually did turn out interesting
i think i'm gonna call basically on the

[02:01]
i think i'm gonna call basically on the
river
uh on the river is actually quite
interesting because
if you would put in a small sizing
i might have i think a little bit of a
worse hand to call
but versus the more polarized sizing

[02:16]
i mean basically he's saying as ace jack
and king jack think those are the most
likely hands that will play this way
if he has stronger than that maybe he
could go for a check raise again
that's i think an option or at least so

[02:30]
that's i think an option or at least so
i would maybe reduce
a little bit of his value combos
especially if he has had like eights or
something
like it is probably just always triple
checking

[02:46]
this hand can go two ways i would say
i'm gonna go for the big bat

[03:03]
i think it's big bet or check raise
interesting turn

[03:43]
and he's easily calling a gem

[03:47]
and he's easily calling a gem
oh we saw he got he sucked out on us
jack is it bad i think we should raise
his hand
special versus health pot

[04:14]
okay face the re-raise interesting

[04:18]
um not a hundred percent sure
but i think i'll start off with a call
but i wouldn't actually be surprised
this
hand sometimes re-raises

[04:37]
when he jams a river

[04:49]
me we have quite quite a good hand
you could say
i'm going to fold a little bit

[05:01]
i'm going to fold a little bit
guys
a little bit of a nitty-fold there
isolated the
recreational here

[05:20]
actually we got a call from aj as well
going to make a bet on the flop
get a call

[05:44]
i'm going to check the turn

[06:18]
uh
i'm interested in the river
i'm sure the rail's also interested in
seeing his cards now let's
take the decision that we can see his

[06:30]
take the decision that we can see his
cards
okay i got completely owned
completely owned gg
okay can i do i have an applause emoji
or something like that

[07:05]
isn't seven seven or king that suited a
flat
he opens he was opening three acts if
he's opening a little bit little
definitely flat but
i think versus versus those sizings uh

[07:16]
i think versus versus those sizings uh
i'm not going to be flooding
i made a half pot seabed here turn
brings a flush
i think i'm just gonna continue with
doing a lot of half pop betting
you could kind of split the turn
but i think after half pot usually when

[07:31]
but i think after half pot usually when
it turn like this comes in i just keep
on going off but

[07:56]
followed by actually for quite some time
i decided to call

[08:01]
i'm gonna fight a river again versus
that timing
or he was deciding to race then
it's maybe not a good idea

[08:25]
okay he was deciding to race that is
maybe not a good idea

[08:30]
maybe not a good idea
i faced a check race here with the ace
queen definitely calling
face a barrel interesting
i think i'm gonna call again

[08:49]
queen of spades is not the greatest hand
to have but
instinct river

[09:05]
and we're gonna check i wouldn't
actually mind a gem either

[09:17]
can we just win versus six nine that's
fine device exuded big blind versus ep

[09:33]
that's not the greatest of turns
let me think what i'm gonna do
i'm gonna block again

[09:59]
it's a little bit dicey

[10:07]
because it's an interesting river i
think
now probably have a check call

[10:28]
no so i don't have a checkup because he

[10:30]
no so i don't have a checkup because he
had one of these hands that he
could bluff i should take more time for
my decisions because i already had now a
couple of hands where in hindsight i
wanted to do something else

[10:45]
wanted to do something else
that's a good turn actually thank you
very much pokestars for that turn
yeah i should have just made another
blocky on the river
i i thought he would be bluffing these
type of holdings so then i think i have

[11:00]
type of holdings so then i think i have
an easy check call
if it doesn't then i should probably
just bet myself and get calls from ace
king
oh yes that is a good river

[11:19]
snip call oh yes at ace five okay then
we're gonna make a little hero call here
he had a straight how does he have a
straight if i have a six
basically i'm gonna finish this this

[11:30]
basically i'm gonna finish this this
musculars that i'm working on then i'm
gonna work on
the academy to get that up and running
as soon as possible i have a couple
other things to take care of
and then basically i'm going to start
my you could call it quote quote

[11:45]
my you could call it quote quote
normal grind and play more consistently
hi boss what is the program you're using
for products it is
star's caption
you guys run a cfp yes we do

[12:00]
lawyers who jack these guys
inform me or face the check right here
with pocket asus
where's the yetis
here we make tricky tricky tricky check

[12:15]
here we make tricky tricky tricky check
back with the ace king
it's two spots
checks okay should be doing at
a decently high frequency i'm gonna

[12:30]
a decently high frequency i'm gonna
check aces
and here we checked it down
unfortunately we didn't improve
i know it's impossible if it's a river

[12:46]
i know it's impossible if it's a river
i'm going to fold
i yeah this makes a little bat is his
hand
too thin to raise i'm not really sure
i am going to race but maybe this is a

[13:00]
i am going to race but maybe this is a
little bit thin
as he's still quite uncapped i don't
really know the guy so if he comes over
the top i'm just gonna call but
feels a little bit thin uh feels a
little bit weak

[13:15]
and streams on twitch oh [ __ ] so i could
have seen also his hand
jammed but i actually i wasn't that
curious
my confidence in that fold was quite
high
jeremy oh jeremy

[13:35]
jeremy oh jeremy
and then actually we're quite deeper
i'm gonna go twice the pot now that
we're this deep
so basically when i get a little bit

[13:47]
so basically when i get a little bit
deeper we have an
advantage in basically all the overpass
which i think is very valid
as hero i've already checked raised some
sets on the flop
we have eight similar
i just have a very big range advantage

[14:00]
i just have a very big range advantage
which i'm gonna turn into a lot of money
by betting a lot of big
i'm gonna go big that big

[14:17]
i'm gonna go big that big
[Music]

[14:32]
we also now have an advantage in the 910
but that's only
suited so it's not that many
combinations
but i wouldn't be surprised if i get
locked looked up here by jack knights to
the jack 10 suited type of holdings

[14:47]
well i four right here with the ace king
suited
i succeeded check fault oh wow

[15:02]
i succeeded check fault oh wow
my checkout would have been quite bad if
you snap check stands behind okay you
said it
should also be check checking
okay get a call

[15:21]
so i have a little c bit here

[15:57]
barrel to turn

[16:10]
it's quite an interesting spot

[16:24]
it's quite an interesting spot

[16:48]
um
oh wow wow he didn't bluff

[17:00]
oh wow wow he didn't bluff
how can you not bluff that hair my
friend gonna make a c bet here with the
ace
five probably looking to barrel some

[17:16]
turns

[17:30]
do

[17:54]
so we've gone back here to the days king
decided to go for a little ten percent
here on the flop

[18:05]
everyone can be a poker goat these days
okay okay
train i think is definitely a point
where we are going to be looking to do

[18:15]
where we are going to be looking to do
some betting
trying to think in terms of sizing what
would be optimal
i think big with this hand is probably
best

[18:34]
and we just hope for a river deuce

[18:50]
river 4 is also decent i would say
we're gonna jam it in and hope he
doesn't have the nuts

[19:08]
which
he doesn't

[19:29]
[Music]

[19:32]
[Music]
okay he's thinking about it
and a hero called with queen 10 which is
probably a
a frequency call but i want to thank you

[19:46]
a frequency call but i want to thank you
guys all for tuning in again today
bro the lovely spirit i don't think i
had
as i already kind of
uh mentioned don't think i was the most
engaged or most

[20:00]
engaged or most
energetic i also don't think we've
played almost any clips but that's also
because there aren't just
yeah i just weren't a lot of spots to
play clips so
thank you guys and i will see you all
next stream which is going to be on
