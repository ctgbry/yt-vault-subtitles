the launch is finally there our poker
ambition academy is now live with our
more advanced products like the
mechanics of poker and master classes we
were aiming for the mid to high stakes
players while i'm very much aware that
the majority of you are going to be

[00:16]
the majority of you are going to be
playing a little bit lower stakes and
for that we have now provided the poker
ambition academy go over to our site
pokermission.com to find out more is
this the echo show yes you're in the
right place my friend this is indeed the

[00:30]
right place my friend this is indeed the
eco show today we're going to be railing
reviewing some high stakes poker you
fall out of the boat as we say in the
netherlands
here we have an open a call and a
squeeze and when i see

[00:45]
squeeze and when i see
758 with this action i assume check
range for
that and he's in a lot of trouble
that's kind of how the spot is going to
play i assume

[01:03]
thinking about it but i assume he's
going to end up checking
checks
as kind of expected

[01:15]
and a bet which i expect to almost be
happening with range here
as we're a little a very big portion of
reigns that calls and then calls again
is gonna be pocket pairs
for example i looked it up here

[01:34]
like we're gonna be broadway heavy and
have
a lot of pairs here in the middle
so let's say we call when the flop is
indeed what was it eight five
seven

[01:47]
sixty six point five percent check so
like i said quite a high checking
frequency and i assume in position can
bet a lot
in position basically
there is not really a hand that's a

[02:00]
there is not really a hand that's a
clear check ace king off clear check a
screen suited reasonably clear check
hands actually but i think most people
just bad tents but yeah it's just a very
good board
and
it's definitely something that you
shouldn't ignore

[02:16]
shouldn't ignore
basically
ogre is quite simple if there is a board
or someone has a lot of strong hands
it's usually not a good idea to start
betting into that range
okay little limpy limpy this is also the
fun fun thing about having antis you

[02:31]
fun fun thing about having antis you
know you can in general just vp more
which is also good for the side right
everyone feed flipping where the pots
get the average spot goes up i don't
understand why they don't just make
everything empty

[02:47]
everything empty
it's a spot very
probably gonna do a bit too much betting
usually on boards and limp pods where
there's like a two to seven
the low end connected in the future
the big blind can make quite a lot of

[03:00]
the big blind can make quite a lot of
straights for example he has three seven
off that you don't have he can have four
or five off that you might not have
are the tables live or are we watching a
replay we are watching a replay

[03:19]
we got a little raise here from mr lee
and a tank enough from ducks what is he
uh what is he deciding to do
interesting tank i think we usually just
check

[03:32]
hey follow out for a little while and
decide to check

[03:47]
a snap goal
interesting river
recreationals
general reader on recreationals is
recreations are a little bit afraid of

[04:01]
recreations are a little bit afraid of
flushes so then what you often see is
that they will forget to value their
hands but they might still bluff
so usually when flush completes
when the flush completes
there's

[04:15]
there's
there can be some imbalances
going on okay
because i'm operating on the assumption

[04:31]
because i'm operating on the assumption
that he's very polarized in that spot
which
combinatorically narrows his value range
of taunton um could create a bluffing
imbalance if he's not very careful
they are combattorically speaking a
bluffing infrequency can occur on this

[04:45]
bluffing infrequency can occur on this
river i would say
daniel drill long live wacko thank you
very much for the sub man thank you very
much for this sub
stars tested anti-zoom i wonder how that

[05:01]
stars tested anti-zoom i wonder how that
test went apparently not that great
right else i would have
kept it but i think especially in zoom
yeah
i would like it would like to see it

[05:16]
big thank you from ducks it's quite
interesting now what bluff
mr lee can have let's say for example he
did raise four six or something well
that now got there let's say he raised
four five four he's now gonna check
so yeah he needs to turn over something

[05:30]
so yeah he needs to turn over something
really yolo
so i wouldn't be too excited to hear a
color if i'm ducks
the the most natural bluffs aren't
really there queen three
and queen iron he thinked about it

[05:45]
and queen iron he thinked about it
i would have probably liked the race a
bit more
right
yeah i wouldn't have mined a race
depending on your recreational
with the queen of diamonds i think the
queen of diamonds is a very good card to

[06:00]
queen of diamonds is a very good card to
have no need to bet anything bigger
he has five big blinds left now so we
have a
very shorty game
we got actually two all-ins here

[06:15]
we got actually two all-ins here
an ace king versus queens and a screen
versus a6 okay ace king owing guys
what the [ __ ] let's gamble baby girl
here we go baby girl
here we go okay
come on [ __ ]

[06:30]
come on [ __ ]
you hat
jax oh my god
king

[06:45]
okay not good time but the ace king won
queens didn't hold so hey mr wacko if
you don't have many tables to choose
from would you play a lineup where the
table is full of good racks and one
mediocre recreation but you have the
worst position on the fish

[07:00]
worst position on the fish
the recreational is to your direct left
if i would play the game if i have
nothing else
i guess they'll say
usually yes if i have uh but if i have
no tables and that's the only game i'm
just gonna do do something else

[07:15]
just gonna do do something else
basically but let's play one table
that's good there's no other game
it depends how
yeah
it depends on what the alternatives are
you don't have many tables to choose
from would you play a lineup for example

[07:30]
from would you play a lineup for example
i would play
any game
that's why the game is 500 or less
basically
because then always you know you can
still have someone joining the game
whereas if it's already six-handed yeah

[07:45]
whereas if it's already six-handed yeah
you don't really have the benefit
anymore
and i actually missed this missed action
again it was a race call just like the
previous hand
that goes for a one third

[08:00]
that goes for a one third
which becomes a good strategy i don't
know how big you open but basically the
smaller you open the wider the big man
calls and the more you can bet one third
the bigger you open the tighter is the
more you want to battle more of a
polarized strategy
gonna have a high checking frequency on

[08:16]
gonna have a high checking frequency on
this turn
he bets quite big three quarters i
would assume that this usually
or the most players that are watching if
you play lower stakes is a spot where

[08:30]
you play lower stakes is a spot where
you should massively overfall
because people will not uh
first of all they will not slow play
enough it's a spot where you have to do
some trappy trappy checking
and so they will usually battle much of
their strong hands and they will lack

[08:46]
their strong hands and they will lack
the the bluffs
what street do you think people make the
biggest mistakes on

[09:00]
i think it i mean in terms of a solver
right
the biggest errors
if you play for example gto training the
biggest errors occur on the river
because but this is in the solver
because on the turn whatever action you
take you still have the river or these

[09:16]
take you still have the river or these
in the solver the solver still has the
river to make up for your thermostat
same with the flop right that's why
usually changing something on the flop
doesn't really have a big impact because
on later streets we can still maneuver
quite well
but i think often

[09:37]
hmm tough question
because i can make arguments for
for multiple things
he's probably gonna ship it in

[09:46]
he's probably gonna ship it in
think i think you know
what time is it guys i think it's time
to uh it's time to ship it in and go to
bed
ship it in and go to bed
let's see if mr dutty thinks the same
yes ship it in and go to bed gets a snap

[10:01]
yes ship it in and go to bed gets a snap
call
so definitely has to be a flush right
the ace queen with the ace of hearts
gets snapped up by a flush
do you need help explaining what the
hell goes on in these videos well then

[10:15]
hell goes on in these videos well then
poker ambition is the place to go to we
offer various servers for various levels
of players go over to our
sitepokermission.com to find out more
about they're not playing that deep

[10:35]
very good board for the imposition
king high boards in general uh
kneel the three better
but we have to check out from stefan you

[10:46]
but we have to check out from stefan you
can already start narrowing down his
range quite a lot there here i think in
his spot i would just say yeah king
queen suited is a very big part of his
range
pink win suited ninth
with a spade

[11:05]
he calls again yeah so he probably has
king queen suited i would say
the mezza would like queen jacket
diamonds

[11:20]
or evaluate stefan obviously you can
also have a flush draw a standard space
ajak of spades
but ranges here are quite narrow

[11:31]
he's thinking it's it's a very annoying
spot here because basically your range
contains only of bluff catchers
unless you think he has king queen
suited you have king queen suited
but the rest of your range is basically
bluff catchers

[11:48]
and given the stack size pre
i don't think you will have sixes that
often or sevens
see i guess ninth
is an option

[12:01]
defaults okay
what happened here race seabed one third

[12:15]
what happened here race seabed one third
so far so standard
i was going to say turn is probably a
mix but linus likes to keep his bed size
together he goes for a half pot it's an
interesting sizing
i do like it

[12:30]
i do like it
i think it makes a lot of sense
now they're raising from isaac
i like his mom

[12:45]
it's a good spot for a little mergy race
let's say he has
fives five of diamond five a heart

[13:09]
hey jack versus king deuce
you are like the king deuce race

[13:16]
you are like the king deuce race
i mean you have quite a lot of equity
right so it's gonna be
that
interesting bear with ace jack

[13:30]
i think it's a fine barrel
isaac comes out shooting big on the
do-76
stay from this time not with the lead

[13:45]
so it's interesting sure you have some
sort of leading range
a little blocky
definitely the preferred play

[14:11]
isaac throwing out the race

[14:15]
isaac throwing out the race
okay
isaac isaac what do you have
king 9 makes sense
win 9 makes sense

[14:30]
win 9 makes sense
i think that's what he's going for the
king nine and the queen nine
i guess king queen would be an okay
bluff but don't really think that plays
like this
not because
because basically
if king 9 and queen 9 is the best value

[14:46]
if king 9 and queen 9 is the best value
then stefan should be calling a lot with
king 7 and queen 7
king 6 queen 6 type of holdings
so then you want to basically block the
bat you want to block the bad calls of
stefan so
bluffing here with a king or a queen
even though stefan doesn't have king

[15:00]
even though stefan doesn't have king
queen or queen 9 it's still
valuable
jafoy paranor dash
i mean i went to uh

[15:17]
and stefan
again with the block three but it's the
second time it's a signature move
that's a very good play i mean uh

[15:30]
yeah isaac is just in a world of world
of trouble right now
shout out to steven man guys they found
the goat my favorite player incredibly
strong and aggressive play
[Music]

[15:51]
yeah now isaac is in the tank
i mean i guess stefan just wants to in

[16:02]
i mean i guess stefan just wants to in
terms of re-bluffing like what what do
you want to have
i guess a six or a seven
because i guess sixes
and then maybe i get a six because sixes

[16:15]
and then maybe i get a six because sixes
could play like this
and eight is useless
10 is useless
i guess you want to re-bluff a six

[16:32]
and basically isaac has only frequency
calls
because they're all bluff catchers
i don't really see one being better than
the other

[16:45]
very let's let's let's loop this hand up
in the meanwhile
how did this hand go
it was bottom versus big blind correct
we had a deuce

[17:01]
we had a deuce
seven
six
because it's paper
okay
oh wait are the three reports now i'm
mentioning race but

[17:25]
definitely some big bedding gonna go on

[17:30]
yeah i would just say like bad ranges
three quarters is probably a good
strategy
um
let's just do that
our race preferred race item should be
small
i would say the 10.9

[17:48]
9.4 percent we go there was the deuce
right
we should definitely have some leads
here
and i know stefan uh stephan likes
leading so we can already deduct some
dance like and like six five or

[18:00]
dance like and like six five or
something could lead oh sorry we should
just read lead range
my apologies okay so this sim is gonna
get quite screwed
check because here's the problem like

[18:16]
check because here's the problem like
this this turn solution is based on the
fact that
basically he now calculates the turn
strategy based on that the fact that we
already almost don't our range whereas
if
basically if we wouldn't have a dunk we

[18:31]
basically if we wouldn't have a dunk we
would not bet this this often
but okay check
river nine
block
as expected

[18:45]
as expected
still quite some races
small race sizing i think is preferred
okay so
yes wacko you're so good you and we saw
that it was preferred with 0.4 percent
okay so yeah k9 queen 9 like i said
these are going to be most is dominant

[19:01]
these are going to be most is dominant
value
we raise
are 3.65 or something do we want to have
a 6
nine six
seven six i guess
if we had it

[19:16]
if we had it
now we call
what is our most dominant race then
ten seven
why the ten
because he's gonna call with tens but in
practice they don't have tents

[19:32]
practice they don't have tents
and i guess you see they don't really
have calls nine ten barrels so i know i
don't think this applies at all
ten eight and ten nine these are hands
that just always barrel in practice i
would say i understand that ten seven
wants to re-raise because you block

[19:45]
wants to re-raise because you block
value but i don't think in practice this
this works like this
but hey funky spot
funky spot
so now isaac is like is it likely that
stefan finds

[20:01]
stefan finds
where was the range again
is it likely that stefan
finds these hands too often
or not often enough but the 10 6 is he
going to go there too often

[20:17]
i don't
and it's really hard to say these spots
are really tough
no one is balancing this spot
so it's up to you to figure out oh he
calls we have the 10 8

[20:30]
calls we have the 10 8
versus the ace deuce he checked back the
deuce on the turn
interesting

[20:45]
not something the solver does love also
doesn't open ace deuce we hate it it
hates the dusa
i would assume more like sixes or
something is trapping
nope
don't think we really trap
at all

[21:02]
now we have no traps
i would definitely have trapped seven
sixes on the turn
time to i'm too trappy too trappy

[21:15]
time to i'm too trappy too trappy
to trap before my car to trap before my
gun so yeah isak i think has a call on
the river i think if stefan had ace
deuce he could play the same way yeah
