what's up guys it's mindset performance
coach Adam K here and in today's video
you're going to be learning about the
future of Poker coaching now before we
dive into this video a few of you are
probably wondering who the hell I am and
where the hell Ren is gone now I don't
know where Ren is gone he's probably on
the beach somewhere si in pina coladas
but I will give a quick introduction of
who I am and what I can bring some value
to you today so my pocket Journey
started in 2011 and I quit my job in
England which was some rubbish job
coaching of the council and I moved to
Thailand with some friends to start
playing heads up sitting goes and we
played online for six years and we're
able to make our way from the lowest
stakes in those formats all the way
through to the highest stakes in heads
of Sting go over sixe Span in that time
I've been able to travel the world get
myself in a great financial situation
and in 2017 I decided I was going to
move away from playing poker and I
wanted to coach and I wanted to get into
mindset and performance coaching which
was my deep passion so for the past 3
years from from 2017 to now I've been
coaching Pok players around the world on
how to level up their mindset and
performance to become the ultimate poker
player now about a year ago me and reny
started chatting with each other and we
realized that there's a next level of
Poker coaching available and Rene for a
long time had been teaching the
technical side of the game and myself
I'd been doing the mindset performance
and we decided that what would happen if
we joined forces and we created the
ultimate poker program so we sat for a
while and we discussed where poker
coaching was going to go in the future
and what was needed to build the
ultimate poker player and we decided or
we came to the conclusion that there was
three pillars or three pillars to
achieve your PO goals and the first one
is the technical side of the game now
that's going to be Ren's 4 and ren is
going to be teaching you guys the most
advanced uh technical Concepts ever and
he's going into the why we do stuff
rather than the how and I'll leave him
to explain his angles on a different
video but he's going to cover all the
technical site that's the first key
element so you guys agree technical site
the gamees pretty important right but we
realized just having good technical side
of the game it's just one fundamental
skill the next one is your mindset all
right and both of us been around
hundreds maybe thousands of poker
players between us that if your mindset
is not a good place you a't getting
success you have success you're going to
fail so quick all right you not get the
top level you're not have success in po
care without building a strong mindset
and then even with a strong mindset even
with good technical abilities there's
another pillar that matters and that is
performance all right so your technical
ability we've got your mindset and we've
got your performance and you've got to
cover all three of these in depth at a
high level in order to guarantee your
success as a pocket player but if you
can guess what success is all but
guaranteed so after these conversations
me and reny decided we were going to
take on the ambitious project together
of creating the ultimate poker program
called the mechanics of Poker Rene will
do the technical side of the game and I
will do the mindset and performance now
we're very very close to get having this
ready for launch and today I just want
to talk to you about the concepts of how
to build a strong mindset all right so
I'm not going to go in super in depth of
every little nitty-gritty bit that will
be coming up in the program but I do
want to give you an overview and I do
want to give you guys some value here
today all right so this is not going to
be a sales pitch for the program this is
going to be teaching you some Concepts
that you can use straight in order to
start building a stronger mindset we'll
also touch on the performance angle as
well so when I started thinking about
how to create the ultimate mindset
program for poker players the first
thing I thought of and the first module
of the program will be around
understanding where you are right now
all right so you in this very moment
you've got a whole bundle of beliefs
thought patterns the way you think about
life all right very often the reason you
can't get to the next level is You' got
some blockages all right some belief
systems some blockages which are
stopping you from going to the next
level so my goal of the first module is
to highlight these problems to you to
see the kind of predicament that you're
in and how the mind has you trapped in
this box all right now it's not all doom
and gloom at the end of the first module
I go into a belief reprogramming system
all right so six phases to reprogram
your beliefs and build a mindset that
doesn't hold you back all right so
imagine this as almost like like setting
a destination in your s of before you
start going anywhere you need to know
where you are right now all right so
educate on where you are and what is
happening with you right now that is
keeping you stuck because very often
we're keeping ourselves stuck once we
unleash those kind of um what what what
you call them the ropes holding us in
place we're very often able to make
massive massive progress very quickly
all right so the first module is all
about understanding where you are and
reprogramming your beliefs so there's
nothing holding you back awesome Off to
the Races then the second module is all
about understanding where you want to
get to all right now this is really
really powerful and it's not just
setting goals and doing smart goals and
stuff like that this is about creating
an identity for yourself all right and
creating a vision of yourself which is
in alignment with your future Visions
all right so I'm a big believer if you
want to have the life you want the life
that you're capable of having create an
identity create a vision of that life
that you want and create a character
that can step into that identity all
right so is really really powerful um
modeling of where you want to be all
right so you set the goals and you build
this identity and this character and you
start realizing wait a second I have a
lot of control all right so in this
module you understand the the mechanisms
of the brain of how we can actually
decide on the life we want we can
actually choose to have a certain
outcome and we can create a life in
align with that all right so this is
almost like setting the final
destination in your sat nve all right so
we've got the starting point and we've
got the destination on your road trip
and we're going to make that really
exciting really inspiring that keeps you
um engaged all right so we've got that
and then we go into the third module
which is all about how to rewire your
brain for poker and this is what it gets
really in depth so in order to have
success in poker you've got to deal with
a lot of all right like as a poker
player there's a lot of situations that
you're just not prepared for for One
poker feels incredibly unfair compared
to your normal life it feel you feel
very unlucky at times there's a lot of
stress and pressure on you you judge
yourself very highly in terms of am I
smart am I not smart your self-worth
gets tired of in poker so you got to
rewire your brain for poker sounds super
complex right but it's not all right
basically our brains are wired based on
our th patterns and the way we repeat
stuff and you've got to start rewiring
consciously rewiring your brain in order
to deal with the wide range of
situations that poker puts you in so to
do this I talk you through mental models
all right I talk through the concept
that Our Brands have built all these
mental models and I highlight all the
ones that don't work for poker all right
some of you guys be like holy that
models me that models me all right these
are called like coding to biases and
then I tell you how to break past them
all right and how to remodel your brain
so that you're actually able to overcome
the biases of the brain all right so the
brain isn't built for poker not yet
anyway all right unless you've done the
work so your brain is built to survive
reproduce and have a comfortable life
with low energy expenditure basically
but you you can get your brain to do
anything you want it to but you've got
to mold it in that way all right so
we're going to consciously wire your
brain to deal with poker all right so
some of you guys will have trouble
dealing with bad beats some of you guys
have trouble down swings some of you
guys have trouble just losing in general
or trouble when you make mistakes you
have all these things flare up all right
so you want to understand what triggers
you and we're going to consciously
rewire your brain so anything in poker
that comes up you can deal with it all
right so from there we've got we've now
got the starting point we've got the end
destination then we've got a brand that
can deal with all the inputs poker
throws at us all right so we're making
progress we're getting we're building a
framework here of how to deal with the
poker landscape the next thing we need
to go to is how to train to win at poker
all right and as a poker player there's
a certain amount of mental skills that
you need to work on all right so the
fourth module is training to win and
I've tried to focus on the key skills
you need to succeed in poker so one of
those is focus the ability to hold your
attention for a certain amount of time
at the pocket tables and really
intensely intensely hold it and for a
long periods there's a whole training
program I go through on how to train
that skill the second one is awareness
and how you train your awareness so
you've got attention at the the center
of your focus then awareness is more the
peripheral attention how do you train
your awareness so you're aware of as
much stimulus as possible we've also got
using meditation as a tool we have
perspective changing we have how to
visualize and set your intentions and
how to train your mental muscles all
right and we also have a section on
mental toughness how to build resilience
work ethic overcoming adversity overcome
procrastination and build a mental
toolkit that can deal with anything that
the poet throws your away all right this
is development skills so with each of
the subsections of this module you will
learn certain you'll have a certain
training program all right so each
section of the program the course has a
worksheet and training program to go
with it all right so you'll be training
these skills over and over and over by
repetition all right in the final module
of the mindset is your new mindset
philosophy all right so new mindset
philosophy I'm trying to think of a way
of injecting a chip into your head that
gives you a Viewpoint of how to view
situations all situations in poker from
the right lens all right so you can
actually have a perspective that is
almost bulletproof in the poker world
all right so there's I'm drawn on many
concepts for this one and they're all
very powerful and this will really be a
game changer for a lot of you so the
first angle is the poker stoic all right
and using stoicism as a philosophy to
deal with adversity and also to separate
situations from what you control and
what you don't control and you learn how
to think like your stoic at the pocket
tables and this will be super super
powerful all right so this is a real
ancient philosophy of the stoicism the
Greek stoics and I'll be teaching you
how to use that in the poker context the
next philosophy you'll learn is the
performance mindset over the training
mindset all right the performance
mindset is a a mindset we switch on
every time we sit down to play the
trainer mindset is a mindset we switch
on every time we sit to study or we're
trying to learn right these are very
distinct almost like Polar Opposites and
a lot of people use the wrong mindset
for the wrong situation so I'll be
teaching you how to switch on a certain
mindset Philosophy for each situation
you're in all right there's a whole
criteria of things to do for each
framework all right then we've got the
next philosophy which is the Fearless
athlete all right and this is drawn on
the best uh performance habits from
Elite athletes and how they deal with
adversity how they deal with fear how
they build confidence how they're able
to move forward and perform at a high
level in tough environments which is
very very much poker all right so the
way I look at it poker players are like
athletes all right I want you to become
Fearless I want you to build confidence
I want you to overcome anxiety
frustrations any negative emotions in
this in this module you'll again have a
training program in order to become a
Fearless poker athlete in the final
mindset philosophy is How to Think Like
a Warrior all right and this is all
about understanding how high perform
performers think how high performers
control their inner conversation under
pressure when you think about it as
you're in at the pocket tables or you're
in high pressure scenarios what really
matters to your performance is this
inner conversation what are you saying
to yourself how are you coaching
yourself all right this will be teaching
you how to coach yourself and installing
a philosophy that you can use in order
to deal with high pressure scenarios how
to perform at your best over and over
all right so there's a lot of different
philosophies going into this in order to
create get a blueprint for how to think
and I've tried to think about every
situation you guys can find yourself in
and create a philosophy to help you deal
with that all right so we recap here
we've got first of all understanding
where you're starting from and what's
holding you back understand where you're
going to and create an identity and a
character to get you there and really um
igniting that flame of purpose of why
you're trying to do what you do then
we've got rewiring your brain so that
everything that pocket throws at you
you're built to deal with it then we've
got building your skill set all right
armoring up bu training to win training
to win a poker and get all these skill
sets that allow you to succeed at poker
and then finally finally a philosophy a
whole mindset kind of blueprint in order
to think about how to deal with
everything all right from poker to life
the whole philosophy of being an elite
performer is covered within that all
right so that will teach you how to
level up your mindset and like I'm 100%
sure any single person who goes through
this program whether you're the highest
St player in the world are you playing
low Saks you will come out a bit a
different person all right you will
level up 100% all right there's so much
lots of exercise to go through and a
lots of worksheets to accompany the Coe
chain but it's very in depth and it will
change you all right in a very very
fundamental way your partner will notice
the difference your friends will notice
the difference your results at the
tables is going to be completely
different you're just going to be a much
upgraded version all right so once
you've got that so Rene is already at
this point Ren's already taught you all
the technical stuff and you've now
technical Wizards you've now got the
mindset the strong mindset the final
step in order to fully reach your
potential as a poker player is your
performance habits all right and how to
become an elite performer all right how
do you get the most of yourself dayto
day all right so the first thing we're
going to look at is your routines in
terms of your morning routine and your
whole preparation around poker all right
so you're from pregame during game post
game how to systemize your performance
so every day you show up like an elite
performer no excuses every day over and
over you get the best out yourself how
do you do that how do you create a
system for it and luckily for you guys
there's some amazing Concepts we put
together to allow you to do that all
right so that's the first one building
those high performance routines around
poker and studia the second thing we go
into is your habits all right and
building out your lifestyle habits so
you can get the most of yourself this is
from diet from exercise from how to
recover all the habits that you need to
have in order to become a high performer
now this is not just going here do these
habits I educate you on exactly why to
do them and how to do them all right so
you'll learn the what what to do why you
do it and how to do it all right it's
going to be the latest sciencetific
approaches in order to perform an elite
level all right these are very very
tailored to Poker all right there's no
no fluff here and there's no Concepts
every there's no like conceptual stuff
it's all about practical all right how
to install them and day by day week by
week you'll be choosing new habits to
install and there's a whole framework on
how to build those in order to get more
to yourself all right and then we've got
executing like a pro which is how to get
the most out of your de and that goes
from planning to monitoring to
evaluating all right this is all about
systemizing success a lot of pro players
really struggle with lack of
organization lack of structure and they
found it super super boring trying to
create any structures all right so with
this one I've c a different angle and
I'm showing you the benefits in how to
create a system that's personalized for
you and the whole goal of the system is
is to get to the objective all right so
when you're building routines habits
performance measures it's all about
where you're trying to get to so you
create a plan in alignment with those
goals we then create monitoring
variables all right so I get you to
monitor key performance variables that
are very specific and unique to you and
that show you how to create an
evaluation system so you're continually
getting better all right I think Life's
a game of always be growing always be
improving and I I'm show you how to
create a system that guarantees you're
always progressing imagine every day
every week every month you become a
better version of yourself you get
pretty far pretty quick right even if
it's only a small Improvement every day
and I show you able to do that through
this uh Monitor and evaluation systems
right so super powerful this is how to
execute like a pro and then I finish off
the performance modules with some juicy
stuff on how to get into Peak States all
right how to join the elite who can stay
at that high performance zone for a long
time how do you how do you keep your
motivation High how do you keep your
energy optimized how do you keep
yourself in the zone playing your A game
for long periods of time all right so
once you've gone through the other eight
modules you'll be ready for this if I
threw this module at the start it' be
too much for you all right but at the
end of the coaching it's going be
perfect and you guys will be super ready
to actually start performing an elite
level all right and this is really going
to open your eyes to what's possible and
you'll see that the key to Elite
Performance the key to perform at your
best is to manage your state how do you
feel and you guys will know this
intuitively like when you wake up in the
morning and you're low energy and you
motivated how hard is the day how well
do you reform not very well right on the
flip side you wake up motivated high
energy how easy is life how well do you
form different completely different
right even just on that state so I show
you guys how to master that how to not
just leave it a chance I walk some days
I feel good some days I feel bad I'll
show you how to systemize that how to
feel good every day and how to control
your state so you can control your
performance so there going to be a lot
of stuff right this going to be super
exciting it's going to be an amazing
Journey for you guys and I'm really
excited to be working with Renee and the
poker ambition brand in order to bring

tons and tons of free videos on how to
level up your Pokemon mindsets but this
is it my myself and Rene uh I've come to
come to the understanding that this is
the next level this is the future of
Poker coaching it's the technical side
of the game it's the mindset side of the
game and it's the performance all right
