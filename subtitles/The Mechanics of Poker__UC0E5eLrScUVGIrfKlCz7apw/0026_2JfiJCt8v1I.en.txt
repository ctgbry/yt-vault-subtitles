[00:00]
basically luke's four spades but i don't
think i will
ever check her is his hand cool
turn is a 10 and this is kind of the
most um
sort of obvious spot to dunk or at least
that i see
happen most in in today's games

[00:21]
[Music]
welcome back my fellow dunk betting
friends
we are going to continue this donk
betting series where we left off

[00:30]
betting series where we left off
trying to bluff bit too easy with four
high now if you think i will succeed
hit that thumbs up button leave a
comment down below and without further
ado
let's get back to the donking

[00:45]
let's get back to the donking
basically i don't think we should we
don't have any blockers to a flush
or to any strong hands for that matter
so i don't think if we decide
to bluff the river i think we should not
bet too big
don't mind actually blocking again

[01:00]
okay i went for a what is this like two
thirds three quarters bad basically i'm
saying i have a
decent 10. that's kind of the thing
right with this sizing i've
i would have actually preferred the
smaller sizing so i can still value that
like i had like 10-6 suited or something

[01:15]
like i had like 10-6 suited or something
but you know betting a little bit bigger
to make between's
full is probably also not the worst
ideas so
and he did indeed decide to fault
winning a little pot here with the deuce
for and i think this is probably the

[01:30]
for and i think this is probably the
most
the hand that you guys could most
identify with playing in the same manner
okay this is something that i see quite
often at the tables
another hand we're gonna go in limp call

[01:46]
another hand we're gonna go in limp call
territory just like the first hand
versus the baron
this time we're facing against stuff
shark i decide to make a little lead on
the flop
tough shark decided to tag along and
we turn a nine which is quite good

[02:01]
we turn a nine which is quite good
as we have now an open ended straight
draw
basically sort of the nut turn except
for a queen
and i decide to block again
[Music]
again could use a split wouldn't again

[02:15]
again could use a split wouldn't again
mind
[Music]
adding the queen 10 in the big bad but i
decided to go for a small bet
tough shark did not agree he decided to
race
sticky as i am i decided to tag along
and the river is a six and basically now

[02:30]
and the river is a six and basically now
what happens is
i think if you look at block block or
block call turn
who has more aids is probably me
so i decided to use that 8x advantage to
make a bet
i do think i should probably be bigger

[02:45]
i do think i should probably be bigger
given the fact that flushos miss i think
my
bad size should just be a gem um
so this one yeah i should have
definitely just over bet
well luckily i didn't since tough stroke
did raise all in and obviously i'm gone

[03:00]
did raise all in and obviously i'm gone
but i dislike my sizing
as also i don't have that much 8x so to
to kind of sort of remain balance on the
river
uh because in the same time also if you
have an eight it makes a lot of sense to
donkbat because let's say he raises asia

[03:15]
donkbat because let's say he raises asia
on a turn
he's probably checking behind as we have
either have a miss flush draw
or we have an eight or we have a hand
that's at least not going to call a bad
versus hdx so ajax doesn't have much
incentive
uh calling but sh could have an
incentive um
uh betting if he doesn't have incentive

[03:31]
uh betting if he doesn't have incentive
betting himself but he could have an
incentive to
call a riverbed okay
but then i would probably want to bet
bigger so i definitely think this is a
mistake from me
but like i said luckily because i don't
think
that shark bluffed us here but you know

[03:46]
that shark bluffed us here but you know
you never know crazy guy crazy guy
excited to limp in here versus makley
miranda in
the small blind with the deuce four suit
it looks quite pretty
low board quite good for the in position
limper so i decided to check he bats and

[04:01]
limper so i decided to check he bats and
i decided to check home
i think the hand is a little bit too
weak to check race
but could do it with the hearts um as we
obviously sometimes turn some actually
like this time
i check again monkey bats again now i

[04:15]
i check again monkey bats again now i
could check raise now
i have to say i'm not my turn check
raising game is probably my less
developed game not really sure
not really sure how that exactly would
play but i mean i have

[04:31]
play but i mean i have
a gut shot and a flush draw and he could
still have some bluff so
probably here it's it's not the worst of
spots kind of the problem that i have is
if i check raising he comes over the top
yeah we kind of uh
we're kind of in a shitty spot so i
decided to check oh again a river is a

[04:45]
decided to check oh again a river is a
nine
giving the seven is straight and if you
look at the range that i'm check calling
twice could contain quite a lot of
sevens maybe had like eight seven
six seven uh a7 maybe ten seven maybe
nine seven not so much but these type of

[05:00]
nine seven not so much but these type of
holdings so i decided to
throw a little bit on the river i also
think that let's say for example if i
have a hand like 9
10 would definitely be ahead that i
could be leading here on the river
same with eight nine um so i don't think

[05:15]
same with eight nine um so i don't think
i don't think we have to go as polarized
as just a seven in this spot
uh this is also a reason why i didn't
over bet um
so yeah i i like my play and again from
like he could have
jack 7 off which i don't have so usually

[05:30]
jack 7 off which i don't have so usually
from those kind of perspective you don't
want to bet too
big but i like my sizing here and he did
indeed decide to fold so again a nice
little pot for the wacko

[05:46]
mr sherdock on the button opening we
have to jack it off
decide to defend four five six flop you
already know what time it is
it's donkey time so the wacko decides to
dunk

[06:00]
dunk
mr sherdock decides to tag along
and on the turn we're kind of going to
be splitting again
i decide to block uh we talked about
this earlier i think i have
if i hadn't have a hand like seven nine
for example or a two pair

[06:16]
for example or a two pair
or a set uh those would all be good
hands to
start over betting actually a set
or two pair maybe two pair maybe not
that much probably two pair not
but if i have a set or straight i would
definitely be over betting together with

[06:30]
definitely be over betting together with
like some
stronger drills on jacket but i think
jack 8 is fine for one third
and mr shirt of calls and the river is a
six and i can go
two ways again i can either uh block
again
which is an option uh basically saying

[06:45]
which is an option uh basically saying
that i'm still
very very very thin or i can say listen
my friend i have the advantage already
since the flop and now it's time to
utilize on that i definitely have a big
6x advantage
and um i'm going to use that to put

[07:01]
and um i'm going to use that to put
quite a lot of pressure on you
and i went kind of for the last one and
mr sherdock did decide to fold guys i
didn't i didn't necessarily
select these hands that they also
actually had to fold this was just the
nature of the spots that

[07:15]
nature of the spots that
came that came back when i
looked for like dunk bedding lines which
obviously not
like texture is quite important
and certain run-outs have to also be
favorable so it's not like the most

[07:31]
favorable so it's not like the most
frequent spot in the world but
i think it's definitely something that
if you start to understand and implement
in your game it's definitely a windbreak
booster
deja vu sherlock again and we have the
queen eight time we

[07:46]
queen eight time we
queen ate this time we did make a little
promotion from the jacket to the queen
eight
and we have actually a certain sort sort
of similar
board and i will use a similar strategy
and measure dock is also using a similar
strategy so far

[08:02]
strategy so far
and the rear now is a three and this is
quite a good card for us
obviously and here we can go two ways
again we can again
that's small saying that we are still
betting
uh like a jack or two pair

[08:16]
uh like a jack or two pair
but actually i think he doesn't have
much sevens i think a lot of sevens in
his range would raise
the flop um so i think if i have a set
or two pair
i can still just bet big a deuce it's
also not that relevant probably more
likely in my range so i think my range

[08:31]
likely in my range so i think my range
in general can just bet very big here
which i did do went for the over bet
and trying to get another pot in
and it did indeed work again guys sure
dog
laid it down and we want a nice little

[08:46]
laid it down and we want a nice little
pot again here with the queen eight
we open the jack ten suited get called
here on the button
we're playing heads up i decide to throw
out
a little c bat with some backdoor

[09:00]
a little c bat with some backdoor
potential not really a spot i'm gonna do
a lot of seabedding but i think
a low frequency is fine and then this
hand i think is a fine candidate
i get called and on the turn is
nine and i decided to continue barreling

[09:15]
nine and i decided to continue barreling
i don't think on the term we're gonna
use a lot of small bats um so i prefer
to
kind of split my range into a big bad
small bat like all my team value bets i
think i will now just be checking i
don't really see much value twice

[09:32]
and on the turn actually we get raced
which is quite a strong line from our
opponent
but it's also a line where i think
villains
range is lacking certain hands i thought

[09:47]
range is lacking certain hands i thought
there was still a chance that we
actually might have the best hand some
of the time believe it or not i think i
had like
um five four suited or five six suited
is
likely i don't think flush draws are
very likely
maybe our jack antenna is sometimes live

[10:01]
maybe our jack antenna is sometimes live
maybe turns a hand like i don't know
seven six or something into a bluff and
if he does have a strong hand let's say
he does have a set
he could raise that on the flop if he
turned the set that's very likely where
he turned two pair
with a hand like ace nine suited but we
still have a couple of outs to the nuts

[10:19]
still have a couple of outs to the nuts
and you guys already know what's coming
as this is a very dunk bed related video
the river is the four of clubs and i
decide to shove my stacking
i think that if you look at

[10:32]
i think that if you look at
the range that i'm betting the flop with
bad calling the term width
it doesn't really contain a lot of
bluffs if i indeed had five
six i now have a straight so basically
eight
tenths suited which i probably actually
won't be opening from this position

[10:46]
won't be opening from this position
so basically then tanjak suited is sort
of all that's left
or i need to be turning a hand like ace
king with a king of clubs or something
into a bluff
uh actually remembered his hands that he
timed for
aegis before calling with the h9

[11:03]
aegis before calling with the h9
well i think the timing in his hand is
quite important if he snap calls you
with ace 9 then i should definitely
uh label this as a very bad bluff
uh i couldn't really control myself i

[11:16]
uh i couldn't really control myself i
i i just tried to win the pot and this
is actually a good tell
uh in general if you're trying to play a
little bit creative poker
uh you know you're gonna be bouncing on
the lines of what is good and what is
just a little bit spewy

[11:30]
just a little bit spewy
okay like you cannot make some genius
plays without also sometimes blundering
a hand that's kind of how it works when
you try to step outside of your
comfort zone and try to find certain
place and
your intuition sometimes screams like
okay maybe this is just spew i did have

[11:45]
okay maybe this is just spew i did have
that with this hand like okay maybe
we're not pushing it too far i'm just
trying to win the pot
um and it's not necessarily that always
trying to win the pot is better than
sometimes just giving up
and i think this was maybe uh maybe a
hand but
he did time for quite a while if he snap

[12:01]
he did time for quite a while if he snap
called it would have been quite bad but
at least he thought about folding uh and
this is a hand that's quite high up in
this range
okay so i hope you guys got
inspired by this dunk bed video and go
out and confuse the poof by

[12:16]
out and confuse the poof by
tongue betting on multiple streets
uh in general i like that about donk
betting as it's not
really the most common thing that i see
it kind of
throws your opponents off guard it makes
you it makes them

[12:31]
you it makes them
face something that they are not use
facing and it might be in that is a spot
where people can definitely make
mistakes
okay because i don't don't have much
experience in that spot whereas if you
have studied how to play these kind of
spots well
then you can definitely have a big

[12:45]
then you can definitely have a big
advantage all right
i wish you guys a lot of luck and thank
you for watching
