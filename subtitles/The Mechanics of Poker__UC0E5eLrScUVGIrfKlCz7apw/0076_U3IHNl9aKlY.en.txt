new promotions hi there boys and girls
and everything in the middle fellow
poker enthusiasts and welcome to a new
video here on the poker ambition channel
in which today we are going to be taking
a look at
a hand that i've played in one of my
previous streams there was quite some
commotion about it and actually i was
quite
interested as well to take a little bit
of a deeper dive into the hand
um also kind of showing you the process
that i go through after i play the hand
like how am i gonna figure out
um if the hand was played correctly
correctly
if i could maybe learn something from
the hand if there was something that i
missed
i think especially since i've also
twitched while playing the hand i can
also kind of look at my thought process
and see if something goes on in there
so i think it will be just very valuable
for you guys to kind of see
how that process looks like if you like
this video guys make sure to give it a
thumbs up
subscribe to the channel as i'll be
leaving more videos
and let's get into the hand so we are
at the youtube channel of poker ambition
and we're looking
at some previous stream highlights
we just start off with a little clip of
the matrix
touching bullets well we are going to
flop a 10
a pocket dancer
very important predicting what's going
to happen we're predicting the [ __ ]
future a little conor mcgregor quote
i'm the [ __ ] future i would say this
is um
classified as an above average flop
clearly in our thought process at the
moment there is nothing going on of
value
here so this is the first point
our opponent see bats
stack his ass okay this very advanced
play
but i face a quarter of the pot on the
flop
and i have a decision now
so first step in general when you try to
evaluate a poker hand
is usually nowadays you look at what
does a solver do okay what is
optimal in an optimal world so i ran a
little sim for you guys
we have the 1033
going on this is gonna be our out of
position range
approximately calling a four bet from
the big blind versus the cutoff as you
can see pocket tense is going to be
there in there at a 100 frequency the
rest of our range is going to be
a little bit stronger overpriced like
jackson queens slow play aces some of
the time ace king
and some high broadways and maybe like
some suited connectors
so as kind of predicted the imposition
will
basically bad range for a quarter of the
pot
and he bets and now we can actually see
that we're going to be raising 37
percent of the time
you can see that even if we flop top
boat stacking his ass
is clearly a play that the solver does
sometimes prefer
this is something that i think same with
like check raising aces almost at a full
frequency
it's something that not a lot of people
do in four bad pods so this was already
this is a concept that i'm aware of
um and something
that while playing the hand or while
playing forward pods as the color
i do try to look to fast play a little
bit more often so this is a thought that
was somewhere in the back of my head
we didn't go for the check race we
actually went for the check call
and the term was a deuce and let's see
what happened
it's very likely as an overpair jax
queens kings asus i don't want that
schedule so here we can see
my main thought process stack his ass he
has a lot of overpass it's quite a tight
position we're playing cutoff versus big
blind
in general the big blind tends to
three bet if we talk about like a
tendency of the population the big line
tensor three but a little bit less than
gto and what you then often see is that
the cutoff also responds by four by
bluffing a little bit less than in gto
and this is something that you often see
in
population imbalances when there's a
unbalance in one side
of the tree kind of the population
intuitively responds by countering that
in the other side of the tree so the big
blind is on the three bedding therefore
the cut-off starts on the form but
bluffing this is something for example
that i take in consideration
let's say we would have played this hand
small blend versus button
i would ask the mate population to have
a little bit more bluffs
my range is a little bit wider so their
willingness to follow through
based on the fact that my rate is a
little bit wider as well is going to be
a little bit higher
so i would not have check raise now i
just estimated that over paris
were a bigger proportion of his range
and you heard me say
i don't really want a scare car to fall
off now if we look at the board
3 3 10 deuce there aren't that many
scare cards right
obviously if an ace rolls off that's
probably the worst card his jax queen's
kings are
no longer going to pay me off maybe i
should do some leading something that
we could actually consider um
but let's see what the solver does first
so we came to the deuce actually i
didn't have any leads in the sim and we
can actually see that we were
or at least the symbol have quite a high
burning frequency if he did show up with
a bluff like ace nine
suited as eight suited king nine suited
which are kind of preferred bluffs in
this position maybe like a ten nine
suited
um you can see actually tennis suit is
always checking
these blocks are following through at
basically a hundred percent frequency
because these hands weren't in there at
100 frequency preflop so
the combos that he does have he decides
to always barrel
here you can see with the king queen and
the ace jack he decides to do kind of
the same
and i think ace king here we can see
quite a high barreling frequency still
and i think here
is where a lot of people will just take
their shoulder value i don't think
this is a barreling frequency that most
players will use i do also think that
kings
is in there at a higher frequency same
with aces they are probably also just
going to use that i'm going to stack his
ass strategy
um and a screen is actually not bearing
that often this is probably something to
do with the fact that it's gonna block
hands that i will fold like a screen
suited
yeah that's gonna be my primary float on
the flop um
so yeah we bet and now it's up to us and
here we can actually see that tens is
just a pure
call if we had queens we now will do
some check raising but basically the
check raising mainly occurred on the
flop
and not on the turn so basically i
should have used the stack as
on the flop and as played in the solver
world
i should have slow played this is mainly
because as we saw he's bluffing at quite
a high frequency and he's sometimes
checking
kinks so we can see in the solver that
okay in an optimal world
this might be optimal but my estimation
was that he was
had last combinations pre in bluffs and
that he will barrel at a less bluffy
frequency
so now we have to give him new
information and then
show us what is the optimal strategy if
my assumptions are correct
so for that we have played around a
little bit flop is
the same turn is a 10 and here you can
see in the sim as well it's locked
that's because
i've reduced the barreling frequency of
air actually i didn't increase
increased kinks actually let me show you
guys really how to do that
why not so we say that this is the range
and we want kings to just always barrel
same with ace let's say just always
barrels is over pair so here we can now
see
they have 100 barreling frequency i
already reduced the bluffs
we let the sim run it's gonna be very
fast as it's a four back pot
it's already stopped so now we have the
scenario where if we check
villain is betting overpass at a very
high frequency
and we lowered his bluffing frequency
with air
now actually what we can see is that
tenth is going to become a pure
check race now obviously when we go down
this tree
it becomes a little bit more dangerous
because we're working on assumptions
a lot of people like to stay away from
assumptions completely and i think this
is very incorrect
um there's a lot of people that talk
more about
you know the intuitive movement shout
out to mr charlie carroll
i am lucky i am skillful and i will win
you gotta feel it and i think using your
intuition
and kind of maneuvering around
the population and as helmut would like
to call it kind of dutch bullets here
and there
and maybe stack someone's ass here and
there even though gto doesn't prefer it
i think this is kind of what uh what
turns an average midsex player into a
very good player all right making those
right adjustments
so now we can see that we clearly want
to check race
and we want to hero fall because his
range is going to be a little bit
stronger for all reasons that i've
explained
so if my sums are correct this was
indeed a profitable gem
i don't want that scarecrow so back to
the hands we indeed jammed
and he folded yes unfortunately he
actually had a bluff okay
recently here also in my response okay
he actually had a bluff you know respect
for him i did not expect that i would
have expected his range
to be a little bit too value heavy and
therefore made an adjustment that i
thought was higher av
now another way to do this and now we're
gonna go a little bit more to the
dinosaur age of
solving a poker hand is a program that
i find very valuable and i think it's
very underused
if any of my cfp students are now
watching it's like oh no the weka is
going to open carter on this ev again
and you're damn right i'm going to open
carter on this ev again
this is card runner's effect this was
kind of uh
the solver before solvers where it would
give you the evs of place but
you had to put in the put in the
variable so obviously it's quite biased
but i still think it's a very valuable
program i think they also have i think
this gto plus
things that that's their solver program
but i'm mainly here for the car to run
the tv so what i did was i gave the cut
off a range
he opened we threw back the pocket tents
i made him for bat and in the four bed
range
i already kind of estimated okay
how much bluffs is he's gonna have i
think he was now folding to
a five bet around 35 percent of the time
which i think is quite reasonable for
population as well
then flop 10 d3 like i said i expect him
to just
uh bet range for a quarter of the pot
you can see the evs of his bat where
they are basically all minus ev
that's because we always have a boat
because i only gave us
tens and because it's not solving based
on all the information that doesn't
really matter we just want to
focus on okay what is the ev of our hand
and mainly on the turn
so how do we do that we call
turn now the return is the first place
where we have to then make estimations
right
so here you can see that in my
estimations i have made in barrel always
a hand higher than an over pair
basically i said at least an over pair
100 of the time and then with a lot of
these hands like top
pair i made them bad 50 of the time and
then like some bluffs 50
of the time and here we can see the
total and you can see that also
for example the ace jack and the king
queen they kind of fade away that's
because it's less combinations
so in the end he has a barrel frequency
of 62
and at least or around half
of his bearing base is going to be an
over pair and he will have some checks
and now this is kind of the decision
point right do we race
or do we call now obviously raising uh
it's plus a fee it's winning us 116
chips on the 16 bb because we have the
nuts
basically always and here we can see his
losses
because he's obviously always losing so
now we have to compare the ev of raising
with the evf calling so how do we do
that well i made him race and then it's
at 50
so i open up another tree towards call
and here you can
see that the calling option right now
here it says 117
it says on the 16. so i already did some
first calculations estimations and we
can actually see that it's very close
but here comes now i think the good
future because for these kind of spots i
think carter runs the v is very handy
you can now group rivers so i group the
river in blanks a 10 a jack a queen a
king and an
ace and you can play around in the tree
so
what i said on blanks we check uh
obviously i think our ev of checking on
blanks is going to be very high 145
this is basically uh like i said
one of the reasons why you want to jam
now is because he has a lot of
overpressure you don't want scarecrows
to run off
while a blank is not really a scare card
so we're not losing any value
and he's sometimes bluffing so what i
told him was listen you're now always
jamming your overpass
i sometimes made him check jacks because
the positions are quite tight
and maybe like for example on a nine he
might be scared of nines
so i do think it's he might still also
be scared of queens
he might be scared of aces might be
scared of 10th so i don't think it's
unreasonable for someone to check back
jack some of the time and i made him
bluff the high cards that he arrived to
on the river
um 50 of the time now obviously if i
would increase his number
so we now have the call at 117 ev
if i would now say he's barreling he's
gonna
barrel the river 75 of the time so you
get some more aggressive player
and we run the calculation again we can
see that we won three more big blinds by
calling the turn
because in the future we will get
bluffed more often right so this is also
more practical example versus more
aggressive opponents obviously
you know if you play versus guys
completely out of his mind then and he's
just bluffing way too much
then obviously i would never consider
raising the turn
so the main problem is going to come
when
let's say the river is a king because
now suddenly in the checkpoint range is
going to have jackson queens and these
were hands that we were actually getting
value from on the turn
that now we lose value from so that has
to then be compensated by the fact that
he's now going to be bluffing his jack a
screen
and his ace nine suited etc etc same
with an ace i think the ace like i said
is probably the worst card you can see
also our checky v here wins only 90.
uh because he's just gonna yeah his high
cards
this gun is gonna have a top pair and
yeah we're basically in trouble he's
just gonna check back a lot and we're
not gonna win any money
so this is another interesting way of
calculating in my opinion especially
turn spots where you kind of doubt
between two lines
you can then kind of play around with
the variables and this is in my opinion
a very important skill and this is
something that people forget when they
just look at the solver
you need to understand the variables
that impact the ev so in this case like
i said if we have someone who's
completely out of his
out of his mind stacking his ass is not
a very good strategy
then you know giving him rope and
letting him hang himself is the correct
strategy
and how to make a lot of money in poker
is to estimate
that on the table estimate the profile
of your opponent
and then adjust accordingly so
conclusion being it's quite close
it was not necessarily another bad idea
but it was also not necessarily a very
good idea
let's say for example the turn had a
flush draw to go with it
like a nine of hearts for example then
you could actually make some arguments
that maybe on flush rivers he would
check back a bit more often
with overpass that would actually maybe
be a reason to jam a little bit more but
now as you can see
the evs were actually quite close
now if you guys liked this analysis and
if you want to
see me do more analysis of hands that
were very interesting on stream
you know leave comments down below
create a discussion about hands that
i've played
and maybe i will pick up on that and
create a future video
i hope you guys learned a lot from it i
think knowing how to evaluate hands that
you've played
whether that's hence if you played very
well or very wrong
in the end guys in poker like you see on
my streams as well i make various
mistakes
it's what you're gonna do with that
mistakes and what you're gonna how
you're gonna learn from that mistake the
person
who's gonna learn the most from his
mistakes and knows how to learn from his
mistakes
that's the person that's gonna end up on
top so
am i going to see you on top or are you
going to say the solver is 100 calling
i am gto up to you
