they could counter adjust but it's an

[15:12]
they could counter adjust but it's an

[15:12]
they could counter adjust but it's an
anonymous pool so it was very hard for

[15:15]
anonymous pool so it was very hard for

[15:15]
anonymous pool so it was very hard for
people to counter adjust. Um, so that's

[15:17]
people to counter adjust. Um, so that's

[15:17]
people to counter adjust. Um, so that's
where I developed like my sort of red

&gt;&gt; Well, in order to make the exploitation

[17:20]
&gt;&gt; Well, in order to make the exploitation

[17:20]
&gt;&gt; Well, in order to make the exploitation
of course you want to know the theory.

[17:21]
of course you want to know the theory.

there's nothing like that comes up on on

there's nothing like that comes up on on

there's nothing like that comes up on on
top of my head. I I remember a

[29:10]
top of my head. I I remember a

[29:10]
top of my head. I I remember a
conversation with a guy once that was

[29:12]
conversation with a guy once that was

[29:12]
conversation with a guy once that was
like thinking that he essentially he

[29:17]
like thinking that he essentially he

[29:17]
like thinking that he essentially he
thought that everyone was just

[29:18]
thought that everyone was just

[29:18]
thought that everyone was just
approaching it wrong. He was just like,

[29:20]
approaching it wrong. He was just like,

[29:20]
approaching it wrong. He was just like,
you you you just like try and get to, I

[29:24]
you you you just like try and get to, I

[29:24]
you you you just like try and get to, I
don't know, 2 million at like the

[29:26]
don't know, 2 million at like the

[29:26]
don't know, 2 million at like the
fastest possible. So, oh, you just take

[29:29]
fastest possible. So, oh, you just take

[29:29]
fastest possible. So, oh, you just take
insane variance and then if you drop

[29:30]
insane variance and then if you drop

[29:30]
insane variance and then if you drop
down now, you just start grinding again.

[29:32]
down now, you just start grinding again.

[29:32]
down now, you just start grinding again.
But I just feel like this is such a like

[29:35]
But I just feel like this is such a like

[29:36]
But I just feel like this is such a like
you just that's just you need such

[29:39]
you just that's just you need such

[29:39]
you just that's just you need such
little variance to go against you for

[29:41]
little variance to go against you for

[29:41]
little variance to go against you for
that to happen. And now you have to

[29:43]
that to happen. And now you have to

[29:43]
that to happen. And now you have to
start over and go and and thinking that

[29:47]
start over and go and and thinking that

[29:47]
start over and go and and thinking that
when you go down and you can say you can

[29:48]
when you go down and you can say you can

[29:48]
when you go down and you can say you can
just grind it up again. Sometimes you

[29:50]
just grind it up again. Sometimes you

[29:50]
just grind it up again. Sometimes you
also go down and you can just like take

[29:53]
also go down and you can just like take

[29:53]
also go down and you can just like take
on bad various and it can take you a

[29:54]
on bad various and it can take you a

[29:54]
on bad various and it can take you a
long time to grind it up again. So it's

[29:56]
long time to grind it up again. So it's

[29:56]
long time to grind it up again. So it's
like I feel like that approach was very

[30:00]
like I feel like that approach was very

[30:00]
like I feel like that approach was very
bad to just go insane with your with

[30:02]
bad to just go insane with your with

look at your frequencies, your stats,

compare it to what solver stats would be

[37:56]
compare it to what solver stats would be

[37:56]
compare it to what solver stats would be
in the sim in similar spots. And so it's

[37:59]
in the sim in similar spots. And so it's

[37:59]
in the sim in similar spots. And so it's
a lot tougher to actually like identify

&gt;&gt; Um I think blockers are super overrated

&gt;&gt; Um I think blockers are super overrated

&gt;&gt; Um I think blockers are super overrated
in most spots. um like river river

[52:48]
in most spots. um like river river

[52:48]
in most spots. um like river river
bluffing or bluff catching spots. Um

[52:51]
bluffing or bluff catching spots. Um

[52:51]
bluffing or bluff catching spots. Um
like if someone bets pot on the river,

[52:53]
like if someone bets pot on the river,

[52:53]
like if someone bets pot on the river,
you need to win a third of the time. And

[52:56]
you need to win a third of the time. And

[52:56]
you need to win a third of the time. And
in many cases, it's going to be you only

[52:59]
in many cases, it's going to be you only

[52:59]
in many cases, it's going to be you only
win 20% of the time. So block, unless

[53:02]
win 20% of the time. So block, unless

[53:02]
win 20% of the time. So block, unless
it's a super narrow range spot, blockers

[53:05]
it's a super narrow range spot, blockers

[53:05]
it's a super narrow range spot, blockers
aren't going to swing the equation 13%.

[53:09]
aren't going to swing the equation 13%.

[53:09]
aren't going to swing the equation 13%.
Um or or you win 50% of the time against

[53:12]
Um or or you win 50% of the time against

[53:12]
Um or or you win 50% of the time against
pot. So then you just call your whole

[53:14]
pot. So then you just call your whole

[53:14]
pot. So then you just call your whole
range. So, like I think a lot of a lot

[53:17]
range. So, like I think a lot of a lot

[53:17]
range. So, like I think a lot of a lot
of spots you face should be range calls

[53:19]
of spots you face should be range calls

[53:19]
of spots you face should be range calls
or range folds, you know, or range

[53:22]
or range folds, you know, or range

or range folds, you know, or range
bluffs or range give ups regardless of

you know, when when you're facing a a

unblocking bluffs. The bluffs don't

[53:35]
unblocking bluffs. The bluffs don't

[53:35]

And yeah, also, you know, I've just put

in the most study using, you know,

[1:03:43]
in the most study using, you know,

[1:03:43]
in the most study using, you know,
common sizes on flop and turn. So those

[1:03:45]
common sizes on flop and turn. So those

[1:03:45]
common sizes on flop and turn. So those
are the ones I try to implement.

[1:03:47]
are the ones I try to implement.

[1:03:47]
are the ones I try to implement.
&gt;&gt; And when you say, to clarify, when you

[1:03:48]
&gt;&gt; And when you say, to clarify, when you

[1:03:48]
&gt;&gt; And when you say, to clarify, when you
say one size, you don't mean that you

[1:03:51]
say one size, you don't mean that you

[1:03:51]
say one size, you don't mean that you
only use one size, but when you see the

[1:03:53]
only use one size, but when you see the

[1:03:53]
only use one size, but when you see the
texture, you decide on one dominant size

[1:03:56]
texture, you decide on one dominant size

[1:03:56]

that you're going to use for that

[1:03:58]
that you're going to use for that

that you're going to use for that
texture. Correct.

as well to RNG.

&gt;&gt; So, I use RNG um pre flop and MTTS

[1:12:23]
&gt;&gt; So, I use RNG um pre flop and MTTS

always, you're three betting too much.

[1:12:36]
always, you're three betting too much.

[1:12:36]
always, you're three betting too much.
If you do them never, you're not three

[1:12:37]
If you do them never, you're not three

[1:12:37]
If you do them never, you're not three
betting enough. And then if you simplify

[1:12:40]
betting enough. And then if you simplify

betting enough. And then if you simplify
by only picking certain certain hands,

[1:12:43]
by only picking certain certain hands,

by only picking certain certain hands,
then you have problems post flop. So, I

then you have problems post flop. So, I

[1:12:46]
then you have problems post flop. So, I
I like using it for pre flop. Um,

[1:12:49]
I like using it for pre flop. Um,

[1:12:49]
I like using it for pre flop. Um,
sometimes for flops. That way, you know,

[1:12:51]
sometimes for flops. That way, you know,

[1:12:51]
sometimes for flops. That way, you know,
you'll have some flush draws, you check
