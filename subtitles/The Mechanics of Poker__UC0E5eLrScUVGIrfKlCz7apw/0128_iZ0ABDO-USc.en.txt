got a little announcement for you guys
because next to our mechanics of poker
program and master classes we have now
released the poker ambition academy in
this academy you will be receiving
weekly interactive webinars based on

[00:17]
weekly interactive webinars based on
your pain points we will be discussing
all areas that you can improve in to
become a more successful poker player
taught by coaches who have walked the
path that you are currently walking so
if you're interested go to the site and
i'm looking forward to seeing you in the

[00:31]
i'm looking forward to seeing you in the
academy
welcome welcome welcome
first end of the stream
trips
very dry board
this is the part where we're gonna
probably only over bet we get a check

[00:45]
probably only over bet we get a check
race
how ridiculous thing is that
so now let's hope we jerk yeah i mean we

[01:00]
so now let's hope we jerk yeah i mean we
sucked out on him hopefully
unless he has pocketed
that wouldn't be a great start of the
session
probably going to check
i already see any point
embedding

[01:15]
embedding
regardless of what he has

[01:31]
and you add
a flash drop
and we win our first stack of the day
interesting
kind of debating sizing here the
recreational still on the hands you
actually get a call
from a 17 bb stack

[01:46]
from a 17 bb stack
it's gonna
what do you call your whole stack with i
mean i guess you can still have a king
i went for the bigger sizing as there
are so many draws on the board and
they're still recreational

[02:05]
i'm a little bit concerned about the
cold call but on pots
it's difficult because everyone
perceives spots so differently it's very
hard to
make accurate decisions

[02:19]
right
i guess if he has 64 he kind of has to
go with it not going to be very happy

[02:30]
go with it not going to be very happy
but
given the fact how much money there is
in the middle
or he's just timed out that
river
means

[02:45]
means
am i check folding
i don't think so but this is a horrible
ripper i mean he never has seven eight
so that's good
or at least i assume he doesn't call off
a stack with seven eight jack queen i
guess could be an option

[03:03]
yeah i think just
padding is probably
the best of all options
because if i check let's see he has
pocket acer a skin maybe he rips it in i
still feel like i have to call

[03:16]
still feel like i have to call
i'm not very happy about it but let's
see
like i said
people perceive bone spots in such such
different ways yeah this was
this was a this was definitely a
scenario i was afraid of but like i said

[03:31]
scenario i was afraid of but like i said
it is
i feel like
my natural bias in these bomb bots is
that i'm a bit too careful where i see
other players are
splashing around a little bit more than
i am
so i try to take that in consideration

[03:46]
so i try to take that in consideration
that i don't
get too foldy
i'm not gonna mix this because this is
the set and you know what you have to do
when you have a set

[04:00]
have to pay smooth and get all the money
in guys
boom
the last tip i have for you is on small
pocket pairs
and these are hands that you can win
monster pots
so when you get delta pocket pair try to

[04:16]
so when you get delta pocket pair try to
flop a set
play it smooth and win all the money
[Music]
decide to proceed with a little call

[04:36]
yeah block his main blast which is going
to be something with a three
it leads me to think he's more made hand
heavy

[04:49]
texas for example i would probably just
call but i think there's i'm just gonna
get it in now

[05:05]
uh

[05:27]
okay

[05:31]
yeah you're dead sir so basically for
the reason
i jab
so basically the reason i jammed threes
and not sixes was i figured h3 would
rebound the flop not a6

[05:45]
rebound the flop not a6
yeah
turned out i was uh i was wrong
but it did turn out great suited i would
definitely get in i think with this
stack size i'm still going to do it
close though

[06:01]
oh
it's nine off
i thought he wasn't that crazy so far
but as you can see again so far doesn't
really say something
when you play against a recreation

[06:15]
when you play against a recreation
this is again also my my natural default
tends to be a bit careful and
recreational
i have some hands also in uh that i
usually go to before playing didn't do
it today but you know these
recreationals show me again their
randomness so every time my thoughts

[06:31]
randomness so every time my thoughts
are folding come into my head i get
reminded
this kind of stuff
again is a poker ad

[06:46]
again is a poker ad
do i still have that i'm not really sure
actually if i still have the ad
this is the very highest frequency check
for my range especially deeper
say it's almost a range check

[07:32]
but definitely check raising the turn
bring the government upbeat
great strategy let go

[07:45]
great strategy let go
hoping praying you know
these are the ways
to do it in program
we get a call
not that angry river now isn't it
i think we should probably block

[08:02]
block the side
be one of these spots
hmm

[08:22]
[Music]

[08:33]
okay my friends
in a master class we take the deepest
dive available out there into one
specific spot we will compare all the
strategies discuss all possible lines
discuss various textures talk about gto

[08:48]
discuss various textures talk about gto
and how to exploit your population
you're already further down your career
and there's just this one or two spots
that could need some extra work the
master classes are for you the master
classes are revised and improved content

[09:01]
classes are revised and improved content
directly from our cfp program so what is
the spot that you have most trouble
playing in browse through the
masterclass library and fix those leaks
bump up action bumpy comfy bumpy fat

[09:16]
bump up action bumpy comfy bumpy fat
action
pop a king
more inclined to check with the
recreational here

[09:43]
foam

[10:05]
checks the turn
go for a check as well
river is six which should make us the

[10:15]
river is six which should make us the
best hand
that's big unless you have five seven
suited
trying to think of a hand that checks
turn that can actually call the river if

[10:30]
turn that can actually call the river if
i race
and check
the river i raised so ace king
that crosses my mind

[10:47]
we were obviously calling let me get
that one straight
this display this is a little bitty

[11:06]
i mean
what the [ __ ]
as mr rack panther would call it
what the [ __ ] our mechanics of poker is

[11:15]
what the [ __ ] our mechanics of poker is
our main coaching program we made the
academy which is more affordable for
lower stakes
still very good quality
there's a format i think i'm going

[11:30]
ain't not suited it's my least favorite
hand
but i would say obviously mechanicses
are are our most complete most intense
program
people sometimes then ask me is it too
advanced

[11:47]
okay five zero three with some of the
time 86 i do that i see
players using
the rng the opposite way i just use it
high number is aggressive
doesn't really matter right
11 is quite not aggressive but i do feel

[12:01]
11 is quite not aggressive but i do feel
like just shipping it in and go to bed
so we just ship it in it's time to ship
it in and go to bed
up we're ahead
just got our money in the head guys
that's how you do it
another secret of poker get your money a
while ahead and you just went twice

[12:19]
classic internet players over playing
ace king it's not even a not even a
parent okay so that's the standard
that's the standard young guy you know

[12:30]
that's the standard young guy you know
internet play is to just move in for 16
big blinds but the guys they're around
for a long time they never use that play
you'll never see daniel the ground you
do it you'll not see any of the great no
players do that
flop here with the pocket kings

[12:45]
flop here with the pocket kings
flip flop ass you can have a screen
suited it's a great turn as well
here i'm gonna go in

[13:02]
i think there's plenty of
possible blocks from me mainly the ace
diamond jack uh the exam the ace club
jack the ace club queen
i think this is also the best way to get
value from a 10.

[13:19]
he could sometimes look me up
in suited

[13:38]
thank you very much sir
give it to me baby

[13:45]
give me [ __ ] what the [ __ ]
also there i will refer you to the
academy and to my series how to become a
more successful poker player
will actually be available soon

[14:01]
let me see
six seven eight
nine ten straight
that's a good hand straight

[14:21]
this is check back that's it
that's

[14:42]
i think i misplayed this a little bit
small i have

[14:45]
small i have
three
i think very small spy if you have the
set now as played i guess i'm a bit
small again
but i misplayed this and
a lot of ways
yeah i misplayed that

[15:00]
yeah i misplayed that
a lot that was
they call a big blunder
if you have a set that's fine because
then you have way less hands like this
but
now he's going to have a lot of these
hands so basically you want to just
punish that that's very big

[15:17]
punish that that's very big
go through it here from the cfp
obviously calling
not a great board

[15:30]
pick yep to check
nickname of yeppy by the way kid gto
people didn't know

[15:51]
okay gto checks again
the low number chucky checky as well

[16:01]
that's an excellent river now isn't it
unless he has pocket aces
that would not be great
what's my play

[16:29]
without any further inspiration i just

[16:31]
without any further inspiration i just
went for the eye of the nuns i go in
main block has to probably be a river 9.
