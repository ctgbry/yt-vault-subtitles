goes for halbot hbot is very weird he's
basically saying he has
ace4 oh I think versus the line that he
took I think we suddenly have an okay
blocker with the
four wouldn't be
surprised if he just shows up with Queen
10 here or
something King
10 yeah that story uh didn't really
check out in my opinion
[Music]

over to Poker miss.com to enroll and
make
advantage of this
promotion the pool let me see poo poo do
I know people Mr Goosey in the house
Goosey Goosey never Loosey is present we
got vit 90 I've played with him
before and
s come out for three bet straight away
if think KN and suited we have an easy
call and that's a beautiful
flop let's see what it does he goes for
SNAP one3 cat it's actually a spot
where in
theory I think you want to approach it a
little bit more big bat check that's
personally how I approach it obviously
you know you can still also bet small
that's perfectly fine as well this hand
is close let's open for the sake of the
video Turn is
interesting our hand is not great in
terms of blockers because we block a lot
of the hands that are going to fall to a
bat especially if we bet big however if
we bet small I think uh he's probably
still going to continue with some flush
draws I think that's fine also I think
if he did see bat a bit too often on
this board uh I think just following it
up with a small bet is probably going to
be good
um on the river I think just unblocking
all the sets
Straits two pairs Etc we just want to be
jamming so that's what I'm going to do
not too much thinking going on
there and he
F here when check check check we don't
block the 68 suited we do block a king
six suited let's say we had the eight
hearts or something we could probably
consider calling
[Music]
um an eight in general though is quite a
good card because 78 810 58 and stuff
are definitely hands that he could be
betting on the turn with uh so I would
say having the eight of hearts or having
the eight of what the other one the club
I think uh it's actually an okay spot to
call I think it's quite
close and when things are close your
blockers start to really matter do think
in general people kind of over fetish on
blockers in some spots it's very
important in other spots it's a bit less
important and I think a common mistake
is that
people raate their the weight the weight
that they put on their blockers and
unblockers for making their decision is
the same in a lot of spots where I think
where in theory you know this is
definitely true but I think in practice
uh the weights that you should give on
it should vary here we're going to go
for a check race with the bottom bear
back to flush draw I think it's a fine
play if we can get a hand like eight n
clubs to fold that's actually quite
quite a good
result here we Face a barrel with the a
jack I think we have an easy call again
the
46 46 is pretty
[Music]
interesting terms of what we should do
not 100% sure think I'm going to go for
a block
the three is actually quite a bad card
four five completing so that's not
great and now on the river the jack
isn't that
great jack isn't that
[Music]
great think I want to do I want to do
with this hand
here we Face a barrel we would probably
prefer to have a spade calling because
he's probably going to give up a Miss
flush
draw um so I would prefer to have the
Jack of Spades that's
one Jack 10 is definitely a hand that he
can be barreling
with bucking my ajck and h10 however I
think he could maybe still B ajck
himself even though it's probably close
the three really sucks
really
sucks yeah this spot feels a little bit
close not really sure what I prefer to
have probably ace5
ace4 and here we have a
fold on the river very interesting hand
I would
say very interesting hand I think on the
turn our hand is actually a fine bat
we can even check some rivers and
sometimes win versus Ace queen or Ace
Jack however on a jack River that's kind
of uh out of the window and I think if
you look at the hands that
we want to be betting I went for the
overb I figured you know we block a set
and a set is going to call the sizing
that I bet I didn't go too big because I
think if we have bottom set you know he
will still have the advantage King 10
off King jack off type of
Holdings so that's why uh I didn't go
too crazy there
here from small blind think he's more of
a recreational player I'm going to go
for a small overb I'm going to call here
with the
ace5 PX off is definitely in his range
so we should definitely take it easier
on this turn but with A5 A5 kind of
sucks
first overb the problem is he could
sometimes do this
with maybe like Ace three or something
or a three or a four and that really
sucks but I
do I do still think we should probably
call
this but I'm a little bit afraid to that
he now shows A3 or something that would
really suck
we don't have a
club but also I don't think that really
matters a lot only I guess if we River
the as of clubs that could be trouble
but the five of clubs doesn't really
matter he gems we have easy fult okay
interesting spots interesting spots we
will take a little a little dive deeper
into some of the hands afterwards to see
uh to
see how our reasoning was
and I think this is something that you
should always be doing while playing but
uh you know we got into some interesting
spots straight away so that's good
because that's what you want to see when
you're recording a a YouTube
video so I'm going to try try to now let
go of all the hand H we played because
we already had a lot of close decisions
and what you usually don't want to do
is keep wandering on past played hands
while playing new hands because then
let's say I always see it as this your
brain when you play a hand let's say you
have 100% brain capacity to think about
the hand but if 10% of that brain
capacity is used to still think about
the previous hand yeah that's a waste
right so usually what I do is I'll I'll
mark the hands and as soon as I mark
them for me they're they're sort of done
I will look at them afterwards obviously
when you're making a play and explain
video is a bit more difficult because
you're trying to explain certain hands
and talk about certain hands even though
new hands have already been
played but uh this is just a general
piece of
advice auses easy go
Jack
Queen two regulars behind think if the
cut off opens could consider just
calling if this guy opens I think I'll
three bet and if we get three bet
ourselves we have an easy call now flop
a royal
flush that's not a royal
flush okay chooses a more polarized
approach or at least sort of polarized
approach I'm personally not a big fan of
a Health poot strategy on this board I
don't really think it achieves that much
necessarily
so okay turn have easy fold I want to
say if you now check to us I think we
have a good betat because I don't think
queens and Jacks make it to this flop
sizing that he used and Ace Jack Ace
Queen could so we on the turn we are
definitely blocking some of the stronger
hands in his range
but I think on that board I prefer
either bet bigger and check or bet very
small and check but the half pot for me
I mean in the end you can make a
strategy around any type of
sizing but for me at the half pot
uh doesn't really do
it A10 I think just a bit too good to B
and just going to check fault
five for suited going to go for the
three bat probably not folding to a four
bat unless he makes it like 26 big PLS
or
something interesting flop we can go
either we can do various things
here we can do various things here I'll
go for a check
race you can bet big you can bet small
you can check race you can do whatever
the [ __ ] you
want let's say with ace5 I would
definitely prefer the
check uh the check race 54 I guess I
prefer betting a little bit more for
example I I feel a bit
more I'm a bit happier now and check
check with ace5 than with 54 basically
Ace
Jack this spot we could approach in
various ways I'm going to go for a check
now we Face a delay
bat and is is very close
already it's very close but I think I'm
going to call
one interesting
River interesting
River I'm going to check for the flop
for a big
bet I think a lot of his Bluffs on 95 D
are going to be for example 10 Jack I
would much rather call Ace King than Ace
Jack in a river it's quite
interesting goes for halbot halp is very
weird he's basically saying he has
ace4 oh I think vers the line that he
took I think we suddenly have an okay
blocker with the
four wouldn't be
surprised if he just shows up with Queen
10 here or
something King
10 you sing the
best better than all the
rest yeah that story uh didn't really
check out in my
opinion like I said I mean he he sold a
good story he sold he for suited but
unfortunately for him we had the
four so given the sizing and line he
took our blockers played let's say he
jammed he doesn't have ace4 so then our
blockers
are sort of useless but still then we
would be unblocking a lot of Bluffs
because he doesn't really have a bluff
with a four in
it but yeah interesting
hand think if you would have see that
the
Flop not really sure what I would have
done in the turn probably check fault so
I guess s plate
it turned out good for
us not really sure if we maybe do some
donking there on on the
ace a part of my my repertoire you could
say on the turn when I called there was
definitely I was considering donking
like some Spades you [ __ ] dunk you do
it again I remember in a video before
I've told you to not dunk
and I think our improves are quite clean
with the five and the four don't think
that would scare is Jack Queen suited or
something King Jack
suited Queen 10
off could actually three B at a low
frequency usually with some of these
offsuit hands you can do
that back to Royal Flush
draw he goes for m I like the
strategy let's say I had a lower pair or
something with a club and my check race
but I think this hand just wants to
call a kicker does play which makes me
lead a bit more towards betting
so that's actually what I'm going to
do if our kicker let's say we at I think
105 is probably your best example of a
check he goes for the race um by betting
small I sort of open myself up to
this having the queen of Club is
good I me the 10 is a bit whatever
a queen in general I think is
okay but I think I'm going to
fult actually our time bank is running
out here let's refresh our time
bank I think it's just a good run out
for me I would have already folded quite
a lot of my air on the Flop and on the
river I just am very M hand heavy
like I said I would have probably
checked lower 10x
so
yeah don't think we have to be too
concerned there and we can just call
uh like a rivered king Jack or queen
Jack is already
better is Queen suited probably if we
for bet it's going to be a forb bet call
we could probably do it some of the time
or else we call a queen off we and
definely forbat and then fold I think
I'm just going to go
for a forbat
call and this works
again king
queen go EAS check on
flop we have an easy open even ver half
B I think king queen with a heart
definely still a
call pocket
eight not really sure if a king is
lead lead that a
word PO is a bit close I went for the
check but sometimes you you'll see this
hand already being bluffed the 10 is a
very bad
card but I do think we should be
betting a hand as strong as our
hand just try to get value from a
nine or pocket sixes why not
I mean I guess bucket sixes block six7
suited and unblocks like Ace Jack or
something that I could be bluffing with
so I think actually it's a fine call
78 we can do a little bit of
everything let's go
for King
six probably on 200 rake we never
calling this and just falling I think is
fine 78
he
bats I'm going to try a little
ra little ra
Daisy [ __ ] my pot boy [ __ ] my pot
get the [ __ ] out of my pot thank you
very
much any thought
Al for dog probably also recreational I
don't see him
reloading pocket T let's go for the
three
bets pocket aces on a wheel board with
the diamond pocket T here I don't know
if this guys are recreational I think we
should play it fast if not
think we should be a little bit
careful because we're in very tight
positions I don't think we should be
overrating T I think T without a heart
is definitely checking this tense could
also just bet once or a small sizing
hoping to fold out king Jack or
something and it kind of also depends if
you think like I'm not really sure what
this guy is then I prefer checking a bit
more because he could be recreational
and then I think in general they're a
bit more stabby so then we get some
value out of Bluffs if we
check I'm not really
sure and I think now we have a pretty
clear
bet here for is half pot half pot I
think we should raise the river but it's
a bit
close the snap calls with a straight
okay then maybe
maybe a river race it's probably
close again it's the half pot maybe
maybe this is a 200 Zoom thing that
people just you know they saw out
there's some small Bing some big bing
let's just bad half pot then you're
really missing the point in my opinion
again I think it's a turn
where I I I or at least in my philosophy
how I approach Boer also how I
explain poker for example in mechanics
usually you want to have a big sizing
and a small
sizing because basically with with those
things you can achieve like some hands
if you have a medium hand meak to weak
to medium hand you just bet small if you
have a very strong hand you bet big yeah
that makes way more sense from uh
generating EV perspective uh compared to
uh betting half I think half you kind of
missing the
point but
hey went for the forbat here Queen 10
suited I think I'll overcall with
another Recreation on the big blind and
try to flop something beautiful fourway
that uh seems like an okay strategy
could also be convinced that squeezing
is
okay he
[Music]
calls I'll just start off with
quarter I want actually bet a little bit
bigger with this
hand I want to
bet why you not listening I want to bet
35%
butt me time just going to fold straight
away if I had backs I would call so I
think Queen 10 of diamonds is basically
the one that I
fold because we have very bad
suits we would much rather have Spades
so blocking the king T of Spades for
example nine1 of Spades so this hand has
no business on the turn at least here
we're going to open to 22 I'm just going
to fold with the pocket
a I do think our hand can make it in a
bck b
line mainly not
blocking Ace Queen and Ace Jack don't
think he has Ace King he could have
pocket NES I think this hand probably
makes it into a jam on the river I think
it's just time to ship it in and go to
bed obviously this also kind of depends
if you think he's going to call Ace Jack
then maybe King Jack is better but I
think you know incredibly strong and
aggressive
play blocking
nines and not blocking the the floats
that are going to fold the river except
for maybe king queen of hearts but I
actually I was trying to upsize the Flop
a little bit to make him King
Queen of Spades for example King Jack of
Spades not really sure if 35 does I felt
half pot felt a bit too
big and 25 felt too small but that's why
I landed on 35 but I guess you know if
you want to be picky 40 I think 40%
would have been a little bit better
Queen
five all right I'll let that one go my
friend I'll let that one
go I'm going to do something that I said
we shouldn't be doing but go back to the
36 St at hand where we at Aces
usually if you have a
straight usually want to just use some
some bigger sizings there
unless you think I'm going to be spaz
raising a
lot I don't think we can call our hand a
spaz race though but get the point this
hand we could probably
squeeze preferably more off suit hands
but I'm trying to
squeeze a little bit more I think this
hand uh can make it King
Nine can do a little bit of everything
let's go for an
overbut won't have too much overb bets
on this board but I think King
N is a fine to do that with
because it's a hand that if we bet one
turet and gets check race it cannot
really call I mean it cannot call now
either right the check rised but if you
over bet it's going to happen less often
whereas if you bet one3 in check raises
let's say at king9 suited with back
doors you could possibly bet call with a
one3 after a one3 sizing so then I think
betting 1/3 already becomes a bit more
attractive and that's said King six sud
there or something I think just betting
one3 is fine and if you check raises
then you give him the two thumbs up and
you muck your
hand and I think if your hand is a
little bit better let's say you have
ace9 I think it's a fine
check so yeah then you should always try
to think about okay watch your range and
like some weaker Kings clearly just want
to bet one3 and fold some stronger Kings
Maybe king queen I think king queen can
bet one third and call
can can
um this is under the same
model and now we actually do have an
offsuit hand it's actually Sam who calls
oh
everyone everyone calls Jesus guys come
on
ah just bet I guess bet and hope bet and
pray that the guy doesn't have a set or
something I don't know the guy
jams I don't know who this guy is feels
like Queens but I guess he could have
the same hand unknown maybe has King
Jack suited who
knows or Jack offsuit that's uh
Stephanie that was the other hand that I
was going to say
after King Jack Suited
wait I think I now labeled someone else
a
fish yes I don't think you're uh don't
think you're
recreational okay then we were just
clearly squeezing for Value I mean
squeezing you cannot really use the
words value or Bluff it's you know
that's sure just going a bit bit more
linear samt are you still in are you
still in the PO T
because you deserve a little techy
mate where are you
from mate was appropriate he's from the
UK
mate
no was the Jack eight the Jack eight was
it and then he left actually for the
people uh who play0 and want a shot 200
right now is a good poo to do it
on poo started really small when I
started out but now everyone came to
play let's try a little step ke with to
check five I see there's there's
something's happening
there's something
happen Queen 3 is
suited definitely open with a Recreation
on the big
blind this board you can approach in a
couple of ways I prefer
checking and big betting usually versus
recreationals and then this hand
definitely makes it into the
check I'll go for the the car with A8
suited with a Recreation on the big
blind we face it b
um I think just raising is probably
good like
this we're unblocking the king we can
make him fold some Equity with like Jack
n or something not that Jack n has a lot
of equity and it kind of
depends on how often you think he's
going to Bluff the river the more often
you think he's going to Bluff the river
with those hands the more we shoot Co
and the less aggressive he's going to be
on the river I think the more we should
definitely just
race yeah the PO has been uh P has been
very
good six s
suited pretty hand let's go for a three
bet
this is actually one of the one of the
type of ports like the low disconnected
that I do think half pot range is makes
a lot of sense but the other board where
we saw the other guy do it
on um just going to call with the H5
because he's short and there's a
recreational behind
The Other Board I think was A5 twoone
there I don't like it but on a low board
I think betting half pot there has
benefits When the board becomes a little
bit more connected I then prefer to
probably split again between big bat and
check uh big bet and small bat and maybe
even
check think here with the A5
[Music]
this guy is still
behind this is clearly a blue line
versus Red Line decision
and I think we have to call the term but
I'm not too thrilled about
it kind of depends what he does with
king
queen with some worse flush
draws but I think we're going to
call there's a dead hand we cannot call
specifically he casted out
okay better save than sorry
Tutone think I'm going to bet
34s to
pot potting still
appropriate somewhere between these two
sizings I think is fine pocket eight
let's just go for a three
betat don't think there's much turns
that we can fold on
I think the queen and the King are the
turns that we can fold on obviously you
can just raise the Flop and yeah get it
in that's perfectly
fine the only downside is the small is
also recreational is probably very
suited heavy so let's say we race and he
has Queen six of diamonds he's probably
just
folding but this is why I said if we
call we're going to win a big pot at
Showdown more often and if we race we're
going going to win a smaller pot without
Showdown more often so
clearly a red line versus Blue Line
difference in approach you can I but
either player is going to be uh
plus like I said the only downside of
maybe just calling is that there's a
king and a queen turn on which we are
not going to realize our Equity that
often if he's going to jam for a MIM ra
Al call
108 especially if for a recreational you
could say yeah he's from the cut or from
the MP but in general recreationals they
are less positional aware they just have
a certain range of hands that they want
to play you can see this in basically
all positions they play sort of the same
range and it doesn't also in terms of
sizing it Al also doesn't really matter
that often if we raise MIM rise 2x or 3x
they just have a certain amount of hands
that they want to play
so he raises from the cut off but it
could be the same range as on the button
or under the gun so position matters a
bit less I usually always when I play
against the fish in my head it's always
big blind button button big
blind and look at that we were actually
head on the
Flop I have some big news my fellow

opportunity before the doors are closed
and let us help you realize your poker
goals go over to Poker ambition.com to
en
roll rety here with the bucket Queens we
are pretty
deep he goes for forbat okay well let's
win a six on BB pot with the set of
Queens that's uh that's our current
strategy so his forbing
range should be quite Ace exited heavy
A4 suited definitely a hand that could
be in
there starts with a one
tur
which I think even this deep he could
just bat off I think we have an easy
call turn a is very bad I think his
forbing range when out of position here
is going to contain a lot of Ace
exuded also me in position is going to
call a lot with Ace King so actually I
think on the turn pocket Queens
especially with a diamond is just a
fault let's say we had 87 suited or
something I think it's a way better call
because then he has more king queen
suited type of Holdings that he could
Bluff with um yeah also I think Queens
without a diamond is already a way
better Pew than queens with a
diamond but yeah this deep I think the a
turn Just Hits him so hard that it's
very easy for him to run out of Bluffs
and then I I said then I guess the
second option of hands that he could
choose are are going to be the king
queen
suited and well we have two we have two
queens including the queen of diamonds
so I think easy
fault a stand with a heart I think an
easy spot to bet
one3
um want to fold the king to suited just
three on big BL
deep let's say I had ace8 Su there I
would definitely call but think this is
fine but F Queen 10 suited we could
sometimes
forbat let's let that for let that
sometimes be
known Goosey
Goosey never Lucy
good play by
him check
memories Que
suited think is not going to make it in
the call and as you can see gooy gooy
never
losey a five I think we're just going to
check full the
turn after betting half B on the Flop on
this very
dry disconnected board we definitely
Barrel hands like King Jack King 10 I
think those hands are fine barrels
Rivers the ace that's very
interesting the question is should we
check call or bet we have a
five I think that leads us to do a bit
more
checking then let's say for example we
had Ace 10 or Ace Jack I think we want
to do a bit more betting but now he
could have floated King Jack or King 10
of hearts and bluffed now on the river
so I think the side card here definitely
matters also if we check he could turn
sevens into a bluff
yeah luckily we didn't have a jack
because I would have
been likely to bet that myself and then
he would have probably just F the pocket
seven no clue what this guy is I'll
start
call Jack stre B getting it in
definitely going to continue here with
our set
draw
[Music]
here say
normally uh we could do actually a
couple things I'm actually just going to
go for a very small bet I think
definitely recreationals are going to
overall the Flop here with pocket a for
example and he will have more king queen
off in his range so protection is a
little bit more important
here I think on a turn we actually have
a fine hand to
bat given that I would have already
raised fours and
fives with a club on the Flop some of
the time I think six is with a club you
know it's kind of what is left he bets
the river this kind of
sucks I guess we just hoped him to
check Renee if your game is based on
Hope have to re-evaluate
wait um yeah I think I'm just going I
think like I said he can have more king
queen off he also has more East stand
off just don't really think it's the
spot where I'm going to see a little of
Boss flop a little guty
with the
710 a spot where I could sometimes cold
call he has 60 big blinds if you had a
little bit more money I might have
considered the cold call here on the
turn I don't think we're going to step
710 it's only a gutter in a spot where
we have also some open Enders with the
57 the 78 we have a lot of better draws
in our range so I think we're just going
to check f
this one we could sometimes treat let's
go for it this
time he calls kinging five rainbow it's
actually very good board for me the 10
and the eight aren't great but I think
we can just still see B one
third because they block a lot of Dan
that he could call and then fold a82
that King a King at suited actually we
block so that's quite good Queen 10
suited Jack 10 suited type of
Holdings King
Queen
close sometimes check sometimes
bad I think the 108 we're not blocking
king T
suited just going to check hope to rever
eight or
something we
did so having a 10 of Hearts here and
the a of space for example is a way
better hand for various reasons he BET's
actually quite big that's
interesting why would he bet so
big a queen
wo bet so
big why would you bet so big
why so
big so
big very nitty
fault very nitty
fault don't like the Ten of
diamonds interesting a big sizing there
Queen Jack
suited I guess that would have made
sense for a big
sizing okay let's reevaluate some of the
hands we played and we call it a
day shall we
another chance to flop a royal
flush what are the odds of flopping a
royal flush no
clue but I'll I'll accept the Jack I'll
accept the
Jack he bets half pot for half pot and
don't think I'm going to play much
raises now this is again is a board
where I think half pot is an acceptable
strategy
still not necessarily my preference no
on this board I
think whatever E's a gem on the
turn with is Jack
okay first hand was that Ace Jack where
we we debating on the river let's look
at his turn Bing range first not a lot
of unintuitive stuff except for the 10 n
Jack nine off that's mixing in even
without a spade I think with a spade
that makes sense and I guess the most
undu things are like seven six of clubs
which mainly Barrel because we float
more hearts diamonds and Spades that
we're TOA the turn so if you have seven
six of clubs you're blocking the Queen
Seven suited the queen six suited and
you're unblocking a hand like King eight
of diamonds and King eight of heart is
now going to fall so that's why 67 of
clubs is actually a fine Barrel I think
for the rest it looked quite intuitive
on the
river um you see that he will continue
to Bluff here we can see for example the
Jack of Spades that's giving up so this
is why in game I wanted to have the
Spade a jack a spade um you can also see
here if he has just Jack six of Spades
he's going to give up whereas if he has
Jack six a clubs he's going to Barrel so
that was something that I had in my mind
which I think is good let me see a jack
we see that actually it doesn't really
matter that's quite interesting because
it was indeed giving up the Spade so I
was going to call ajck with a spade and
decid to fold the rest which I think and
then H5 and H4 H5 clearly a better hand
um and same for H4 four so calling ace5
A4 and Ace Jack with a spade I think in
practice is actually a fine strategy we
should find some random calls with King
10 high uh this is mainly because it
does a very good job blocking the value
range with Queen 10 and king queen and
Ace King I imagine a king still betting
no Ace King is actually
checking but I think uh I think my fault
there is
fine then we had this 4 six hand we went
for the check race on the Flop which as
we can see here 64 of clubs wants to
raise the majority of the time sizing is
somewhere between half pot and pot we
went for three quars so you could say
that we sort of kned that let's say we
check race turn is a king we can see
that actually there were a bit more big
bets than I would have imagined six4 of
clubs actually mainly gives up the
reason why I baral uh was simply because
we're unblocking the queen Jack a jack a
Queens um he can fold a hand like pocket
a can sometimes call a hand like a queen
at diamonds so there are some mergy
effects going on we keep the
initiative U honestly I don't think it's
it's necessarily such a horrible
play uh if we have a low
flush I imagine if we have a low flush
like five six diamonds actually we might
sometimes want to
check five six of diamonds full check
that makes sense um
and a king we're more likely to bet
because a king can still
improve and 56 of diamonds can't that's
kind of the the main reason the 46 it
does get in there in a bad some of the
time it prefers to have the Spades and
the hearts mainly because uh then we're
actually doing a job Oh wait we're
looking I think at the wrong one no then
it actually does a job of blocking King
for
suited so the block is still fine then
on the
river uh Co
River oh wait I was
looking at the wrong place for the
turn yeah here we can see it 46 space 46
of Hearts definitely betting 46 of clubs
usually preferring checking probably if
you let this run until the end it
probably just checks
so not GTO but I don't think necessarily
that bad then as blate on the river we
can see actually that we don't have big
sizings and I think this is definitely
where I make a mistake I
I didn't want a bat too big that was
definitely something that I had in my
mind and then I went for
125 um because I figured I could put a
flush in quite a tough spot a bear King
in quite a tough spot and we're blocking
bucket force that was basically my
argument I guess it already puts a king
in a tough spot with a one3
sizing King five for example is folding
King n is sometimes folding but yeah the
the the small bet is mainly so we can
still induce Bluff raises which I guess
with 46 isn't that great so maybe in a
vacuum uh 46 picked the right sizing uh
from My overall strategy it's probably
not that great there aren't a lot of
hands that want to bet this sizing I
would say except for maybe pocket force
that just wants
to but even pocket Force probably just
wants to bet small and in juice so
there's no hand that wants to bet this
sizing except for four six of clubs as a
bluff okay the problem so this all
sounds cool you might say like okay well
then it's a good play but the problem is
if something never happens in theory
good players can definitely read through
this and they' be like wait this is this
makes no sense so then the next question
is why are you choosing a sizing that's
not a
thing um is that is it more likely that
a bluff triggered you to choose the
sizing that's not a thing or a value
hand that triggered you to use a sizing
that's not a thing here I guess we could
say a block
so but I mean we ran into I mean cool
cool guy if you still jum now because
like if we would overb which is
obviously never a thing U I think he's
just going to find way less Bluff Champs
so good with our
hand bad overall
strategy then we had this ace5 hand I
decided to go for small but on the Flop
and he raced it's not really a board I'm
going to see but at a very high
frequency the ace5 does something
sometimes bet that's fine he finds the
race and now it's up to us we will
actually sometimes stre bet the Flop
ace4 or Ace three three bets way more
often those would definitely also be my
preference like King three of hearts or
like a hand like king queen I think
these make better three bets then a five
uh so yeah I that's why I didn't really
through b I think 56 suited actually is
also fine through bat I call turn is a
seven I assume we just fully check
because 56 is in there for for him he
indeed went for the small
overbut um this was one of the things I
was concerned about him turning over 54
or A3 or
A4 that wouldn't be great obviously
uh let me see there's there still some
68 I think people can find 67 yeah and
this is this is kind of what I was
concerned about on the turn that love of
the bar rign is gonna contain a pair
like I would not fold a jack for sure
six is five just that makes sense um oh
wait actually I have to see I would not
fold the
Jack okay that's that's then a little
bit too loose I guess but no I would
probably not fold the Jack yet on the
turn A5 sometimes calls having a club
going kind of goes both ways I guess
he's more likely to race flop with Queen
five of clubs than Queen five of hearts
and more likely to Barrel Queen five of
clubs on the turn a queen five of
diamonds or something so if you hit an
ace like I said but if I hit a five and
it's a club it's not really a problem
not going broke and Ace with the club if
I hit that then yeah I also don't think
it's a huge problem so I'm not really
concerned about my suits here and I
would say I almost prefer to not have a
club in practice uh but the call is not
great to say the least I think we should
have just uh let this one go then this
54 suent with three B jack8 five we can
indeed see that the 54 on to sometimes
check sometimes bad big sometimes spe
but like I said uh this hand probably
doesn't really have a big preference I
did actually want to go for the check
race let's see if that's a thing or if
it just call it just
calls uh five4 of Hearts this is this is
a difference if you play for example
single race pot you would much rather
check race 54 of Hearts whereas the spr
is smaller in a three BS you would
prefer to check call the 54 of hearts
and check race the 54 of clubs this is a
a concept for you guys to take away it
has everything to do with um the still
behind and the amount of times we will
get jammed versus the check Race
So I was going for the check race
aggressive play aggressive play I I
still think it's a fine play um so when
now went check check turn was a three we
something so now we much better we we
were actually also talking about ace5
that I would much rather check
A5 it seems to play it similar does it
much rather check rat A5 it does much
rather check race A5 because it's
blocking some of the A5 and I guess he
would stab pocket force and fold that
yeah that that's probably uh that's
probably the problem that's why it
prefers A5 as well so it's it's
unblocking more bad folds and blocking
more bet calls basically check check
Turners a
three uh we check with the
54 he now goes for a delayed step with a
very wiish range we know actually check
raise the 54 and that's because in
position should step pretty linear with
for example pocket seven sometimes
pocket sixes and we can now make that
fold I guess we sometimes still get some
value out of a queen with a spade or
something I think in practice though
it's less linear so I actually like my
call I think this check race is a bit
spewy call River Ace let's see if we
dunk we do indeed dunk some hands 54
doesn't really make it but I did I did
think donking was a thing let's say it's
the six spad or
something we now dun to 54 this was
indeed in my
mind so I would say if the river was a
spade I would have made a good play now
the river is in Ace he went for this
half pot sizing which doesn't exist and
this is a good example of the 64 where I
chose a sizing that doesn't exist and he
could read through that and this is an
example where he CH he chose a sizing
that doesn't exist and I read through
that and made a with
five4 then we had the pocket aces reased
we had this five D four flop I
actually I mean can we call a mistake
yes I checked Aces quite quickly but
Aces because it has more Equity because
it has a gutter to go with a hand you're
much more likely to bet that than I
think Queens Kings or Jacks so let's say
the Flop is is uh
564 then we're more likely to check Aces
and more likely to bet
Kings because see queens now bets more
often than Aces so that's a small Nuance
that I guess I wasn't really paying
attention to however uh we playing T
don't know this guy I'm assuming he's
not dunking and people should dunk so if
we remove this dunk we should definitely
check more in position so but still
small small pointer small pointer turn
is the eight clubs he went for that half
pot is
sizing uh 1/3 I think here actually
because of how connected the board
is I I would personally just lean
towards betting more one3 but like I
said he went for off po we have easy
call with Aces more on the river that we
had
the the question of what to do and again
we see half pot is not a thing okay it's
either bet small or bet very big this
split makes way more sense also from in
terms of what your hands wants to do so
to me it felt like the half pot was very
much weighted towards a nine and that's
why I race on the
river uh 36 as I mentioned you're
unblocking the whole board so that
usually leads you to want to bat pig
whereas let's say we have 54 54 usually
wants to bet small
okay but yeah uh he bet if he bet half
pot we still call but that's in
theory do we even race we do race versus
the first of one/ thir so I think I
played this hand fine I'm still still
fine with how I played the hand however
he did show up 63 so he put it the hand
to a small sizing that should have been
in the big
sizing if that means that his smaller
sizing is way stronger obviously we
should not be calling Aces but we don't
know his complete strategy so let's not
draw unnecessary
conclusion let's look at his Queen's
hand where we were very deep GTO wizard
has 200 Big BL deep Sims what we do see
is we three bet a little bit bigger when
we are 200 Big BLS deep so that's
actually something that I did do we were
even 300 big BLS deep so I went to
10.5 um the out of position the gut off
as you can see is very going to be very
Ace ex suited heavy suited heavy Ace
Queen off actually is still in there I
was a bit more surprised I would lean
more towards king queen suited King Jack
suited Ace suited and all these acex
suited uh obviously if he does forbat
which actually is a huge sizing in the
Sim uh we just call Queens so it's not
going to be it's not going to be super
accurate but let's see if some of the
concepts that I was talking about
actually make sense he should inde bad
half pot this is something that I did
mention especially to on Big B B but he
went for the quarter we call turns the
ace diamonds and he even should down
size down to 10% which already because
he went I think he went around 20% so
queens now you can see with a diamond
especially leaning towards a fult and
let's say we have 87 was mentioning okay
87 is actually folding as well I would
have probably be more inclined to call
with for example nines 10 Queens however
in the Sim he still has quite H Queen
off maybe for three on a big BL Zep that
uh that disappears a little bit and then
I think nines becomes better than
queens and for this last ended was the
108 off with threw that pre big blind
versus small blind he checked we went
for one3 bat which we can do at quite a
high frequency this board is is very
good for us so I think range betting
here is hard to get punished so that's
what we did turn is the deuce um I went
on a
ramble like if it's a spot where you
know yeah you just have not much going
on for your hand you're going to try to
look for some reasons to still Barrel I
said that the 10 of diamonds was very
bad we can definitely agree on that the
10 of diamonds with the eight of spades
for example is a a clear check and then
I mentioned the 10 of Hearts would be a
great card so the 10 of hearts with the
eight of spades and we can indeed see
that that indeed is the preferable hand
because you're blocking King then sued
and you're unblocking for example if we
bet again that would have been a sizing
okay actually I would have probably went
I think three quars is fine he's going
to fold Ace 10 of diamonds for example
he's going to fold Queen 10 of diamonds
these type of Holdings okay whereas
hearts's less likely to float on the
Flop you can see he mainly folds Queen
ten of Hearts but he's floating Queen
ten of diamond so I think how I was
constructing my range on the turn made
quite a lot of sense let's say we have
queen8 it already M matters way less uh
what our suits are because we're
blocking the offsuit ace queen and the
offsuit king queen which are both
probably calling the turn so green high
Barrel is uh it's definitely fine you
also have more Equity versus a hand like
pocket tense for example so I think I
would have constructed my range well and
then the river was the interesting point
right we hit the eight you know great
times we just bet small I think we have
easy call anything half b or less
because then I think he can just bet
worse he checks we have an easy bet then
he went for this very big bet you can
see that there's quite a small betting
around 40% which makes a lot of sense
right you have a lot of pairs who want
to bet small you can see that uh pocket
s was bet I think 62% is that it also 30
36% so like I said around half pot I
think that's a fine sizing for a lot of
hands but then when we go look at bigger
sizing so 87% let's say that's kind of
the big sizing 62 and 87 they're not
really that often used yes if you have
nines they're used if you have 10
they're used because you want to get max
value out of an eight that makes a lot
of sense and if you have a king it's
used and it's very easy in my in my
opinion to in this spot be greedy with a
king right you see most of the dark red
is coming from a king and the bluff is a
little bit less into intive 6 seven
suited for example is the bluff some ACE
Heights are the bluff but actually I
think we made a good fall there on the
river I did I think mention like Queen
Jack sued like some of the hands that
block Queen's Jacks type of Holdings
that they just want they want to block a
lot of the cost for the big sizing
actually I think we made a good
exploited default here uh I know uh I do
know who v card Killer is so maybe maybe
maybe he confirms or Den ni in in the in
the comments below if we made a good
fault or you know if he just releveled
own us chose a sizing and that I would
be like why would you choose the sizing
as a bluff and then actually turn it
over as a bluff you know some next
leveling Wars going on okay so that's it
I think the video overall was quite
educational I think it had a little bit
of everything we talked about some

good the mix that I use when playing
