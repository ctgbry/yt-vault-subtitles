what's up guys
what i was feeling you know like playing
some poker having some fun with my uh
with my twitch
my twitch stream fans
turn it close in terms of sizing
sometimes butcher these kind of spots
would say
especially with our hand we can
definitely bet reporters don't think we
ever want to bet bigger than three
quarters
but i have a lot of hands marked that i
go over before i play
or at least before my
official session which was actually this
morning
mornings this afternoon
actually uh
quite proud of myself this week i think
uh
i followed my schedule pretty well i
made
played a lot of poker
it's good
we also took our first shots at 5k today
yes
you know i for this week i kept it in
the lobbies to see
what's up
not a lot a lot was running i know i
know everyone is now gonna say yes
because you have to play on gg echo
will happen no worries everything uh at
his own pace
but you know i saw a good game i think
it was on 888 a 5k game i jumped in i
liked the lineup seemed like a good game
to take a shot
lost like 2k or something not a big deal
but i thought the game was good
so uh
the first step is out of the way and in
general you know i just played a lot of
1k player of 2k
um
also made very good progress on the
master classes for the people who don't
know the master classes basically i'm
going to release a muscle class for
every spot
well wacko that sticking is going to
take you very long if you take as long
as releasing the next one after the
three by parts out of position people
are just like okay this guy made a
course three by pots out of position
what's the point
it will make sense once you know you see
that they're all there
basically
hey face erase
i'm gonna go for the call
and string turn
definitely turn i'm gonna continue on
as now i have more outs versus a nine
the king is now
put out as well
possibly the king
most probably if he now polarizes we're
gonna call
and the river isn't king
or an ace we should probably implement
the leading range
but obviously until now you know we have
an easy call
actually that ace comes this is
interesting
we should now probably have a leading
range
not really sure how big it should be
i imagine not that big
yeah he's he's gonna fault and if i
check he's not gonna bluff though
maybe we should have even that smaller
just to to milk a nine basically the
wheel is back yes
okay
all your friends the wii is back this is
what we can win a bunch of free stuff
and i personally thought i announced it
quite uh
funny
okay obviously uh correct me if i'm
wrong basically this is what i said
we give away free and then [ __ ] so
if you understood what i meant
it's giveaways free [ __ ]
what you have to do is at the end i will
ask questions
which you will only get to answer
correctly
if
yeah if you've watched the stream
and
the winners
probably do two three questions
and the winners can make a spin on the
wheel and win free [ __ ] that's how it
works that's why it was free
and an image of [ __ ] trying to see
for example i have one table here that i
can just right away sit
i even have the nut seat but that's nice
it's king here i think this is a very
good hand to check
i would much rather bat king queen
or like ninth with a spade than ace king
in general you know you want to have
spades
turn
don't mind the lead actually
don't mind if i do don't mind if i do
he raises i think we still have a call
i think one of the
eight said he could maybe bet on the
flop could be ace eight
like upper middle kicker some people use
it as a rule so you have an easy call
obviously a bad river
ass
is raised on the terminal probably
contain equity like 910 with a spade up
like that back 9 with the spade check
with the spades
check
we should probably bluff this sometimes
king seven obviously our
primary bluff
just like king queen
actually i think
i would probably much rather bluff an
eight as well so i think fluffing ace
king is overdone king queen king seven
and some ace acts uh eight x i think
those should be our bluffs
i think that bluff
here we check back the sixes turn is
amazing definitely raising
yes there are quite a lot of straights
out there but
i think it's important to raise here to
fold out something that has equity
and we can easily get called by love
wars hands
doing king jack ace jack queen axe
you name it
i think it's a
good spot to race
he threw bats which obviously is not
ideal
as obviously
as aware he will have some advantage but
obviously we're calling
and we're just gonna boat up and our
life is easy
if you can predict the future
then poker became quite easy he checks
i think all we can do now is
jam
and hope he has a straight face off i
don't really know this guy so
also not gonna give him too much credit
for hero folding
so i three better ds5 start out with a
small c bet
turn is a bit close but i think blocking
is probably good
i think how big
and go for 20 again seems fine
definitely gonna mix
i think ace five is a fine candidate or
uh for small again
interesting river
i think block again is probably good
and he falls so he probably had a seven
obviously you can also consider checking
but i would probably
rather check if i had a high card to go
with my hand pay attention guys we are
giving away over 10k dollar worth of
free prizes in our poker ambition
academy including a free license to our
mechanics of poker program
so what are you waiting for join our
weekly interactive webinars at the poker
ambition academy
um
this one can go either way
we'll do 50 50.
this is funky
actually this happened last time as well
i think i'm streaming when people were
check raising me here versus the bigger
sizing which i think is in a
interesting play say
now turn is a bit close
this hand is is weird
okay
show me what you got mr monkas
a little bluffy bluffy
a little bluffy bluffy that's what he
had a little bluffy bluffy
we were just waiting
waiting for him to make a little bluffy
bluffy
thank you very much sir
thank you very much give it to me baby
give me [ __ ] what the
[ __ ] a big bet
i'd say it's not the most common sizing
on this board
good
turn thinking queen is now less likely
and i think that's definitely one of the
first hands
checks
interesting
or we said check
and he mocks
what do you have
i go for bananas
yeah i have bananas
this hand we can sometimes play
sometimes not play sometimes do play
sometimes not play sometimes a bit of
everything i will go for call
i'll just do it one third one third or
fourth one third of the time call the
other one third and three bet the other
one third
gto
very good flop for my calling range
isn't bad
hi i'm new here well omega lulu what are
you waiting for hit the subscribe button
like and subscribe
check race never seen this guy before
but he's playing uh very good ass if huh
russians
i don't want to make any accusations but
usually uh
i'm a bit careful when there's an
unknown guy especially from russia
nothing against the russians you know
they just come here
and play gto
out of nowhere
it's a bit suspicious
i'm usually a bit skeptical
but hey rta or not that part was mine
that's why we call this five six suited
it's a very good vote for us where we
can do various things
i will put this hand
to my big bad check
so that means we're gonna bet big and
check the turn that's kind of
what that meant
a little vibe out here on the river with
the two pair
and get cold thank you very much sir
people thought that was too light since
there were a lot of straights
uh uh a little secret here with the
queen jack i have a feeling this is
gonna go
all the way
as we have the supreme
supreme blockers
nice and wacko he really likes the line
so we have fans guys doctor
a good friend dire dome gave us some
credit for how he played the king 10
there he really liked it queen jack the
easiest ship in the world i would say
blocking his main
10x
i'm not blocking any clubs clubs like
ace nine of clubs zandy's gonna going to
fold
king queen this is like best king we
block we block jack then suited with
black queen 10 suited
he folds
[Music]
[Applause]
you're too kind
but hey you flopped two pair
it doesn't really matter now does it
yeah this is going to be a check fest
unless pierre papa does the betting
come on swedenbe in there no
damn
you want to get this guy to fold
this bad hand at 50 percent
i think he will fold almost this range
but that's not bad 150 percent
i think even versus dizzy just gonna
fold
ah what is the result for this session
the three people closest to the correct
answer get to spin the wheel
okay we didn't play any 2k i think we
mainly played 1k and 500 zoom
so we do them big blinds maybe that's
that's a bit easier so
you know we don't have too much variance
in the stick so
in terms of big blinds
how much did we win
in general the zumpo is looking quite
good one two three four fishes
do have some serious opposition though
serbian people also love free [ __ ] he's
there for the free [ __ ]
that's a flush
oh you're putting my friend that's
not a great idea
i think he has a flush
do you ever have a boat oh this is so
unlikely
only deuces or something
owen
he's gonna go for the maximum it's gonna
be greedier
[Music]
he called me with k4 what the [ __ ]
he was like
you would never go away with the flush
you would want me to go apparently not
my friend okay note to self don't block
that guy
so as we already predicted redline going
through the roof
