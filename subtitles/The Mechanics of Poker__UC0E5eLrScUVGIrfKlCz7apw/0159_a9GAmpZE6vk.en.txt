but they will not race whereas if i
okay
yeah buddy if you have a straight you
have a straight
let me see i he could also still have
all the sets
are sick suited
hmm
actually i think i'm going to call
mainly to try to keep jeffy boying
but then i lose value from that guy

this hand could actually do a couple of
things
let's go for a check call
but he didn't bite
i'm gonna go for a delay check race
not biting
i think in a river i'm gonna go for a
check call
i think he's gonna show up a lot of ace
highs around the river that are not
really going to call that but they
could bet themselves maybe as an
underpair or like a random three-four
suited yet ace tree
pocket atc bad for straight two
recreationals are gonna be quite loose
full pocket trees even though there were
three recreations behind but two of them
were with 40 bb
here on the turn i'm gonna
this is not really software proofed but
i'm going to be splitting
because i think people here are quite
white
and
i want to still bet quite a lot for
protection
value
so for example let's have pocket force
there rocket sevens still want to bet
so i'll create a strategy around a small
sizing and a bigger sizing the bigger
sizing then would be probably three
quarters or so
here if i would never check raise this
if you would start check raising you
want to probably have a spade with your
hand
the nine
i forgot how big he better
he continues blocking i think it's a
good strategy
should actually probably still defend
this but i think the way people use the
customer
sucks i think with the king
at queen nine
i mean i definitely fall back nine
i do have a better
hand this is probably a call
don't
then what are you waiting for wacko
i'm holding her at the nines on an asap
flop
hey better the worst hand
that's interesting
i don't think that's a bad underturn
from his side he has queen nine
and then when he finally made the best
hand
he decided to check
a lot of people call eight
not an eight
checks these guys are going to be quite
wide especially
so i will have more hands to get value
from so i actually decided to go for a
small bet here
because these guys will show up with
more hand like king five suited queen
five suited ace five off suit the only
guy i'm worried about is initial razer
i think i want to check the river
and go for a check raise
and the same concept earlier with the
kings i think there's gonna be a lot of
hands that will call my bet
but they will not race whereas if i
okay
yeah buddy if you have a straight you
have a straight
let me see
the i he could also still have all the
sets or six suited
hmm
actually i think i'm going to call
mainly to try to keep jeffy boying
but then i lose value from that guy i'm
on the tree
okay interesting
so that was an interesting spot
i didn't have enough time to figure that
out but i guess it it worked out well
uh
so
like always things have benefits and
downsides i'll fold the king jack of
spades here versus under the gum range
it's quite close though
versus one third
so i was quickly counting in my head and
if he has four six suited ace for suited
that's that makes
eight straights
would make up for nine
if you would
play it that way but i think threes and
deuces are likely to bet the flop more
often than a gutter you're recreational
so
you could say that
i mean obviously
okay very clear we cannot fault i was
debating
if re-raising and getting the extra
money would be worth it
the benefit of call let's say i jam
boy is just going to fold a set
whereas if i call jeffy boy always calls
a set so that's
or at least i assume he's going to call
a set and not hero for the set again
here the small sizing on the low pair
board
it should probably get upsized
don't turn this as close if you want to
go backpack or check
i think actually we should go back back
now i'm going to check behind loose
versus high
races that's why you bet one third
sneaky ass [ __ ]
so i think i think calling there with
the eights is a bit more plus v thinking
queenier on the turn i should have
thought about a little bit more i was
gonna play the river
um
again we were facing a one-third
bet
on this texture it shouldn't happen all
that often
asus
which is the hand that he had definitely
bats from benefiting small so usually
when people bet some on this board i get
a little bit suspicious
um you can actually see that king queen
off
is just mainly a fault which i was
actually quite surprised by
so maybe i'm over calling in this spot
especially if
i think
so actually this doesn't make much sense
i'm suspicious of the wanter but it's
still call so that's probably something
i'm doing wrong
nine
checks
king queen off yes mainly betting so i
got this wrong
and i already thought i got it wrong in
game right
this hand probably just wants to
bat bat because he's now going to call a
lot of king queen with a heart he's
actually raising a screen with a heart a
lot of hands with a heart now are going
to call for blocking kings and queens so
i think this hand now just wants to
blast off so let's say river is a 10.
with king queen off
it's interesting he wants to bet with
the heart but i figured that would block
more
of
villains faults
and i think actually in practice it does
i think people
will check on more ace queen with a
heart and barrel more hearts themselves
so
yeah i don't think i played this this
hand very well i think if it does go
check check i remember it's a five
it's like yeah check and lose
seems like an okay strategy no it just
wants to bet
quite often that's interesting because
smallmouth is actually checking giving
up here with king jack jack queen so we
will actually win at showdown
quite often queen 10 jack 10 nothing not
bluffing here in the river is that big
of a mistake i think not betting the end
on the turn though i think
could definitely be a mistake
luckily i didn't go back back else we
would have lost
narasti
but i do think bad battle would have
probably been the best play
don't have a great hand to bluff
i do think though the spot is okay
and what's he gonna do with knights and
eights
he's not careful that's quite a big part
of his range
he should probably bet fives on the flop
so the five doesn't really do much the
set he could check sevens though so
that's why the seven isn't great
um
but hey clubs is still better than
spades there for example on the river as
he's most likely to just better flush
around himself on the turn
and i just think the way people
construct their rangers
leaning towards the bed they're more
often on the river than not is probably
gonna make you money
now i'm not giving much credit to my
opponent but
sorry mr joe black you're watching
was this a mixed clicker or is this a
strategy i'm gonna go for
this is his strategy
uh this is this is just a miss click
i think we should just come over the top
and then play sort of a single race pod
he's going to be very
pocket prayer heavy it's a very good
flop for me
not only because
i have top pair but also in terms of his
range is going to be a lot of
force five sixes sevens eight nines
and i'm kind of
reducing a lot of the
strong parts of his range it does have
like i said we're basically playing an
inflated pot versus a face up range
or at least unless he misclicked that he
wanted to three bet for example that uh
that could obviously also be the case
here are the third sixes we can actually
do a couple of things i'm gonna go for a
barrel here
this sizing this is probably the size
you gotta choose
what i'm desiring
and river is checked back
and we got two nice streets of value
and yeah he's [ __ ] on that board
basically after what happened on the
deuce made a big bat
i think here
uh i mean i made
yeah quite a big bet i think that's good
on a deuce
whereas on when we had the kings on the
jack 3310
i made a bit of a smaller bet
and leave your comments down below
to explain us
the difference
why did i bet three quarters on the
three jack deus dos where three quarters
was a very big
bet compared to the sbr that we were
playing and the other spot i bet it
three quarters while that was
not a big bet compared to the spr that
we were playing
don't want to give away everything right
oh i'm gonna make you guys think a
little bit for yourselves as well
else what's the fun
just gonna make a small better with my
gutter versus recreational and go from
there don't really wanna check and then
have him maybe bluff me
i think he's just gonna fold this on the
paris and i think on the turn i'm gonna
make another bet because we have a
gutter
snap calls for paris now he starts
thinking about it that's always a bad
sign
and i'm gonna make a fold
we're going to turn we just put quite a
lot of pressure on ace 9 offsuit for
example
if it goes we still have a gutty
and we block some of the calling range
scs if he has the king himself like
purple's gutter he will always call
only downside of betting is that he
would sometimes race and then we fall
together
probably if he raises he's gonna have a
10 a lot so then
we didn't have much outs anyway
am i trying out a step actually with the
king 10 some of the time
the king then specifically i think it's
an okay bat
and now
now he's gonna be like dude
you don't have a 10.
and then i suddenly do have a 10.
very disguising this
the mirror is not like dude what are you
saying
yeah i know
i know it's very unlikely to have a 10
right
so he's actually very likely to
be drawing
my opinion or he has a worse than
i think the only the only option here is
just call
the good river in terms of his draws
were not completed let's say he was
making a little bluffy bluffer with a
five he now also has a boat
come on don't make this a boring handy
you just show up with a 10.
that would be uh that would be a bit
stupid
oh yeah he thought i didn't have a 10.
surprise surprise i did have it then
feel the power
you feel my power baby
feel my power
you guys sometimes it's good to have the
hand
that your opponent doesn't think you
have
this is another reason why for example a
solver
would always try to have a little bit of
everything in all lines so
basically he would not get in a very
high ep spot there on the turn where i
never have a 10 and he always has a 10.
not saying that that is
the reason
that
i bet but
just play a
part um
what
got a small raise here
go for an overpaid here
but the quite the real question now
people are like yeah wacko
i can also call river shelves with boats
the real echo
the real
the real question would be what would we
have done if we were batting king queen
interesting question
and probably the answer to that question
is we would probably have called the one
the ones with the flush draw
because he's likely to
if queens i would
be more inclined to check but jax i
think i'm okay with betting
he can probably fold nines he can
probably fold tens on the turn so that's
definitely beneficial
he can definitely check back
a screen his king
that we could call it
the [ __ ] is going on
you have to be joking i mean
and trying not to be negative but god
damn [ __ ] [ __ ]
okay wait we're quite deep actually this
is something you should have taken
consideration welcome this probably
checks changes his check back range
could we just be dead here he checks
back
for example kings or queens now also
makes absurdly big race sizing
the [ __ ] is going on here
look
i have a feeling i need luck
this is weird
this is very weird
very weird
seventh
so we bet here for
protection-ish a bit thin
the way people usually construct their
ranges i think this is fine
okay i'm just gonna fold
i have no [ __ ] clue what's going on
here
i actually already felt like folding the
turn
versus the
more than three-quarters bot race sizing
let's get funky with the five force
especially i think i'm on 210l i think
these these type of spots are just
yeah they are kind of what they seem
even though they seem like i don't know
what they see
uh
yeah
where tent
but i mean we have straights we have
flushes we have sets we have i mean we
call them
we call the under the gun three bet
and then
we bet the turn a pretty connected board
then he raced and we called the race so
now we at least have two pair
and now he's gonna 200 the river
yeah sounds sounds sounds pretty greedy
to me
but sometimes check race here let's
do it
watch turn that
and probably going to blast this off
i think he still can call
i think he's still going to overcall
with hands like ace jack as queen as
king on a turn he could set off king
queen with a diamond king jack with a
diamond jack queen with a diamond
and i don't think this is a spot where
even a recreational is very happy with
his ace
incredibly strong and aggressive play
oh yeah i think the 200
bet on the river is just a bit too
greedy from him
and the turn racing might be already a
bit greedy
i
i think i honestly think we could make
an argument for folding the turn
because if the board pairs and he has a
flush
is he really
in these knit formations where but is he
really still going to bet the river i
don't think we have a lot of implied
adults let's say river is a queen or
king and it just has queens of kings we
lose our stack and we're quite deep
so
i think
we honestly think calling the turn there
to fold the river is a mistake and
probably just a red line killer
well we've been flocking quite a lot of
sets
so let's do it again
nope
i'm just going to try to bring the ace
queen to showdown
um
forest fives
call sixes as a bit close actually
already i would say
view one hoping for i don't know what
we block one of the a6 suited
i'm gonna fall there with
yeah
don't have a heart out
annoying
son of a heart we block one a6 suited
we don't block five four
we should probably have races on the
turn
wacko
the race is on the turn
one nine ten of hearts one time
king ten of hearts i should have races
on the turn
so we have another spot where we are the
caller in position facing a three bet
this is actually one of the spots that
i'm least comfortable with a spot that
i'm currently
studying a little bit more so no
surprise that a lot of the doubts that i
had were around this position
so he starts off with
a small bat which he can basically do
with range let's see if he bets 33 if
sixes become close no never close so he
bets 20 i call
turn is the ace of hearts
he's going to continue blocking which
he's going to do quite often
he can actually not go that relentless
so
this is actually i think i think is a
spot where it's very easy to overdo it
with for example i had like 910 suited
i think that would make us lean more
towards calling
but i also talked about the raising we
see actually deuces raising okay this is
nothing freeze raising a raising here
actually with sixes is not really a
thing
it looks like
but even seeing this i still
think it's actually not a bad play
actually but they're gonna bet these
hands more often as well
so apparently actually we played the
hand
pretty standard from a gta perspective
perspective
yeah we checked behind the river he gave
up his kingdom which i assume is going
to be the case kingdom has heart yeah
giving up
okay the hand was way less interesting
than apparently
i thought
and that's like i said probably because
this spot this
spot that i
think i'm
worse at
um but do actually
yeah
great analysis wacko great analysis give
us more give us more
the hand wasn't played very well but we
still want the money
why poker such
a weird game
off put that here from our opponent on
ace ace or three
rainbow
no [ __ ] glue this guy is
the bad river
we could probably make a small race here
just accept river isn't the greatest
river isn't the greatest
make a small cold format here
i think this just works well with our
range basically the smaller
volt 4 bet you make you could even go 12
the more we can
hold four bet
now we have easy fault and then when
this happens you know you just lose this
point
with the weaker part of your ring
i think we could have even went smaller
like i said 12
from a strategical perspective would
have probably been better
uh when a river pressed the board here
on the 4 i'm not going to over bet i
would have over bet 7 for example
i'm gonna
rebat here with the a6 he does mirror so
i could also like to call but i think
he's a recreational player and then i
just prefer to
re-bet a little bit more
so many falling deuces and force even
though there was a recreational big line
the problem though with the properties
that pocket deuces has
which is it doesn't block any of the
three bed ranges behind me is that
yes obviously if we open in the big
blind calls this recreational play we're
going to make more money but the problem
is
given the fact that we have deuces the
people behind us will have hands that
are going to rip up more often
could uh actually three bet this but
we're quite deep 240 big blind so
definitely lean less towards three
betting
in general
um ace king we are blocking the ace king
however i think ace king if we go check
raise bad bat is gonna be
a bluff catcher
so i would much rather check race seven
eight seven six seven five type of hands
that have
vector straight draws
and that kind of are not blocking hands
that is probably
supposed to fall by the river
very big
sizing or
this texture
actually it's okay it's on the bigger
side that's for sure
under the gun versus big big blind
yeah so actually in the beginning of the
video i talked a little bit about deep
well
playing a lot of big three by pots or
trying to build a lot of big pots out of
position when you're very deep it's
probably not a great idea so therefore
we had a bit less
it's the same here again with the pocket
deuces in the small blind yes you know
you can call and if you see
in general if you see a flop it's going
to make you money however
given the fact that we have two deuces
the big plants just gonna squeeze the
[ __ ] out of us
killer
rainbow broadway export
blue one third
i would probably check
depending on my suits
i think jax i would have just checked in
general
check nine here we don't have a heart so
i'm not gonna
check raise this
fix back
pink
i think this fine hand for an over but
i think we can over bet quite some queen
x here
i would not over bet here with a gutter
king jack can also sometimes check
and on the river
i think that not having a heart and not
having an ace probably good so i'll go
for the alphabet again
not having a king i think this is just
this is just the perfect hand to to bet
twice with let's say you did check back
queen nine or queen jack he has an easy
call
and let's say the check pack of flush
draw or turned something like a ace four
or yes it's king or his jack
it's most likely falling
so i guess ace king
[Music]
asking with a heart could maybe call
a little bit deeper here so i'll make
everybody a little bit bigger
don't pay too much attention to
i guess the color tags
of the racks here
because
i have not really played with them
tens i think i'm gonna lean towards
falling because the the cold four bed
range contains a lot of the cards that i
need to
for example it's a spot where let's say
i have three bit boxes sixes i would
much
rather call that
because then he doesn't have the cards
that i need to improve and also then if
i flop something with my pocket sixes
oh
everyone is in aces against kings
uh
then if i do
improve with pocket dance
let's say it's king queen nine
uh he will have a lot of my outs in his
hand or in his range
and also let's say i then do turn
straight you can still sometimes have
kings wins so then i again need to dutch
uh
touch another bullet so that's not great
so
that's a little through right here jack
six why the
not
huh
wait you bet
i have to be a bit careful here i think
i
want to raise a bit more polar not too
linear
because i definitely don't want to race
for this end so i'll just go for a call
okay he's very enthusiastic i'll show
him the six i want to show show a card
oh yeah gg
probably a recreational player
good thing that we didn't raise the flop
like you might get triggered there if
people lead into a board that's yours to
just race but
and let's say we had jack then
jack then
was jacked in a gutter
then it's a bad example yeah let's say
we had queen 10 of clubs or something
raising
perfectly fine
because then if he re-raises it's yeah
whatever
but now it would kind of suck don
i'm not gonna [ __ ] with
[Music]
my name position called calls and
the board connects a little bit between
the sixth and the ninth specif
particularly so like it did in this case
uh i'm gonna open it with six of suited
simply because there's three
recreationals
and they will do way less tree bedding
you usually and then you got three bet
so they would do less three betting
and actually if they rebed it we would
do a smaller sizing so
we get to see more flops
he checks
just gonna check
the bad term
he now goes for delayed over bet quite
funky we don't block any of the
the 9x
let's say we had a standard heart set or
something i guess that would we could
consider to be a hero call i think i'm
gonna call the turn here simply because
his bet's so small
and i think if we hit a seven or six and
he has aces or a skin we will a lot of
money
super baby
let's hope for ace jack
checked
let me go for a check call here
check again
i would have definitely check raised h8
for example or king eight or nine stance
but i think having the six and the eight
it's just less hand to get value from he
bets again
we have an easy call again and probably
this hand will
not lead
much to anything
simply because yeah again we have a six
and an eight
nine is not great was not great in
general right he could have five seven
ten seven he can now also have made jack
nine
and 9 10. so actually i think
going to lean towards
holding but i already know it's probably
not what i'm going to do
good luck
yeah
but yeah obviously not not the greatest
of run outs
with the nine pairing and a flush
completing
but i still think uh six eight for
example is a way better bluff catch on
the than for example with
jax queens
these type of holdings assuming that
he's not value betting
a wars eight
uh
it's not toy betting ace eight or
something
which i don't think he is
so yeah i think six eight
kind of has to call and lose
often
i would have there for example also
check raised the bottom set
and probably actually also the middle
set and why i do check raise the set
because yeah set is simply a better hand
than two pair
for example
in the exact runner that we now had if
he had 910 we would have
made a boat on the river and he would
have made trips and now we get
counterfeited so
would have check raised bottom set
always middle set usually and
upset probably not
i usually open a bit bigger when there's
a recreation on the big one i'm on the
button however these recreationals here
on zoom they usually play quite tight
actually i think maybe just opening way
more and opening smaller is
on a zoom table maybe a better
adjustment i think in a wrecking table i
prefer to
open bigger
and we can do that again because they
are not preventing that much
uh here you can play two strategies
or two types of strategies i prefer to
raise a little bit smaller raise a
little bit more
i would change to a bit more of a
polarized approach if finn is very
aggressive
but not knowing much about him
makes me
just lean towards my default
race often or small
i know
actually most people do something
different but
approach it i like
and i start with a check on the flop
and
and i'm going to probably call it
turning to turn again
unless he snaps checks
so what is he not betting that he snaps
the turn with
a little ten percent
so
good that he shows up with queens if
sometimes you see them just randomly pop
at the jack i can get a little bit of
value there on the river from a jack
uh he could have turned a 10 he could
have made a buck advice or something
just don't think people are the
recreational there is going to fall
towards ten percent so we sneak a little
bit more value
could even have bet twenty percent
this is the same guy
see if he puts again
in general you will see me checking
quite a lot towards recreationals
uh in general recreationals
they
have decent step tendencies on both flop
and turn versus missy bets
and they often just do random [ __ ]
so
giving rope to recreationals to let them
do random [ __ ] i think is usually a good
strategy these kind of things for
example can sometimes happen but
therefore i
like to do quite a lot of checking
from a theory perspective
in this spot actually it also makes
sense
you could actually consider a small lead
again because he he did that depolarized
with queens and lassen so he could
actually have a jacket that we now lost
value from
pocket kings deja vu
maybe thought that one true
because i'm explaining that to you guys
but i instantly checked
even though it was something i was
taking in consideration
here at the four three
i think this is a finance to go for a
check race we have some backdoor
backdoor properties we unblock all the
bad folds
for example let's say it's 9 10 off
so you would much rather check raise
this hand than for example 410
because he will have more bad volts now
and obviously we have some
vector properties here with the three
four suited
and most likely always most likely
always that doesn't make sense always
betting the turn
this makes very little to no sense but
i'm just gonna give it credit
here i don't know who this guy is
hmm shall we go satisfy the gto crowd
i throw a little a little jam ski here
why not guys why not we roll high
we are rolling high
oh [ __ ] oh that's why he gem h5 because
we still have some equity
five five no ace
five ace
unbelievable
unbelievable you have 33 and not even
win one
we'll actually make a color with pocket
four simply because we're two and a bb
deep
and in general i want to be calling a
little bit more when we're at this text
size
i think then uh
we can also call pocket force probably
just check call the flop here he will
have way more h5 mainly the s5 off suit
advantage is quite a problem the ace 8
offsuit advantage is quite a problem oh
he actually checks back
and
i love his checkbook range probably
contains a king
or a weak ace
gonna check and help get the showdown
the ace nine can check race check call
check fold first if you bet small big
board is not running out any better
i think just checking down i hope he has
ace high is probably the best play
same here
no this guy just checked back jack seven
suited three times that's a guy versus
which who we want to
defend quite a lot of big blinds as we
get to realize quite a lot of equity
we had a set
it's not too bad
go for a check again when we have the
two sixes
um by betting small i sort of opened
myself up to this
miracle [ __ ] river
um
you have to be a little bit careful
around the turn as he will have kingdom
often i won't so that's a dangerous
advantage he was f108 suited and i don't
so it's quite a dangerous turn there the
pocket sixes
i think
his check back check back range is going
to contain a lot of seventh eighths
ninths
that i'm just gonna
try to get value from i checked the turn
so he if he did check back an air hand
he could now
decide to bluff it
so i was gonna go for like a small and
juice maybe if he still had arrogant
buffers to river i think if he has two
pair he's still going to race
doesn't have to worry that much about
ace queen in my range but fortunately he
had ace queen himself
obviously if we block there we're never
folding
simply because he could have a worse
hand sometimes and we might have induced
the bluff
unfortunately he had a screen
father god damn son of a [ __ ] [ __ ]
bastard son of a [ __ ] [ __ ] why the
[ __ ] [ __ ] sucking hell does this
happen every [ __ ] time
and with the kings even though it's such
a good
turn for his range i think kings we
should still always bet
simply because
it's less likely that he has the king 10
that's one and
if he does have the king then we still
have equity same if it does have the 108
we still have equity
