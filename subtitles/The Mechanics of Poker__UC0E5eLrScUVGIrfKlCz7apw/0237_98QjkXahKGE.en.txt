[00:00]
You can never tell that to yourself.
That can never never exist in your mind.
And if it does and you catch it. In
today's episode, we're joined by Belgian
highstakes entity player Thomas Boyin.
With a background in engineering, Thomas
has developed a structured and

[00:16]
has developed a structured and
analytical approach to poker. You know,
analyze the impact of one parameter. So,
you only change that parameter. You put
it in a few different situations and you
see different outputs and then you draw
a conclusion. His obsession with
continuous improvement has led him to

[00:30]
continuous improvement has led him to
study peak performance, mindset, and
biohacking, reading books, taking
courses, and working with top coaches to
refine his edge. I like to deconstruct a
topic. I save all the handy stories
online where I have a question where I'm
not sure, right? And I put them in

[00:46]
not sure, right? And I put them in
categories. And after a month, I look at
which folder has the most handy stories.
If it's five bet spots and I have one
hand per year, I don't really care. I'm
not going to go into that biggest icing
pressure you have on yourself. So the
biggest rispium, however you call it,

[01:00]
biggest rispium, however you call it,
the biggest pressure, the less you want
to put money into the pot on textures
where the nuts is going to change. When
do you think simplification is overdone
and kind of hurting your EV?
Oversimplifying would be you can bet

[01:15]
Oversimplifying would be you can bet
range one/3 every board and I think
nowadays it's not great. And in poker,
you really need confidence because many
decisions you can never know if they
were good. You can never know if the guy
was actually folding top pair, but this
time he had trips. And so it takes a lot

[01:31]
time he had trips. And so it takes a lot
of reps to build that confidence. And
the more confident you are, the less
validation you need. But yeah, I've had
similar experiences where I thought I
found something and then solver found a
way to remind me that he is omnicient
and smarter than me.

[01:46]
and smarter than me.
And it was a humbling experience.

going to be another great episode of the
Mechanics of Poker podcast. Quick

ado, guys, enjoy this episode. Thomas,

[02:15]
ado, guys, enjoy this episode. Thomas,
by degree you are a civil engineer
specialized in mechanics and energetics.
From what I know, engineer engineering
is all about the problem solving,
creating structure and analytical
thinking. I'm curious, how has that

[02:31]
thinking. I'm curious, how has that
background shaped the way you approach
poker and being a poker professional in
general?
Um yeah, it has definitely I think
shaped my approach to the game in the
way that I think there's two things that

[02:45]
way that I think there's two things that
I learned probably I mean there's more
things that I learned hopefully but two
things the main two things that I have
in mind that I can uh use in poker all
the time. The first thing was just that
I had to study uh at least a decent
amount of you know hours in order to

[03:03]
amount of you know hours in order to
graduate. uh I wasn't the study the
student who studies the whole year
throughout but one month before the the
you know examinations I would spend 14

[03:16]
you know examinations I would spend 14
hours a day for four weeks to binge
everything and study very hard and so
when I came to poker and then it was
time to study again uh it was pretty
easy for me to put on two hours a day or
something like that seemed very light um

[03:32]
something like that seemed very light um
compared to what I before like doing my
degree. Um and I think another thing is
clearly what you mentioned is like the
analytical mindset problem solving. Um
basically the scientific uh method where

[03:48]
basically the scientific uh method where
you want to you know analyze the impact
of one parameter. So you only change
that parameter. You put it in a few
different situations and you see
different outputs and then you draw a
conclusion. and you say, "Hey, when I

[04:00]
conclusion. and you say, "Hey, when I
change that only, it goes in that
direction, right?" Then you do the same
with another parameter and it goes in
the other direction. And then when you
do that with all the parameters,
eventually you kind of have an idea of
how the game moves, you know, left and
right based on tendencies, based on

[04:15]
right based on tendencies, based on
profiles, based on ICM, like all those
stuff. And this kind of understands this
kind of experimental mindset, right? I
think you you know just like many
players obviously you use a solver and
like you said you can change one thing
in the solver and see how that then

[04:31]
in the solver and see how that then
impacts strategy and then instead of
learning okay this is what I have to do
in this spot it's like hey this is the
key parameter that drives this spot
going from either left to right do you
recall any like big aha moments you had

[04:46]
recall any like big aha moments you had
like playing around with these
parameters
uh yeah for sure one of I feel like the
parameters that I was shocked by how
sensitive believe it was is for example
the three bet on the flop. So let's say
your opponent bets C bets range button

[05:03]
your opponent bets C bets range button
big blind right and then you're in the
big blind and you can check raise. Um
now the check raise frequency is going
to be impacted by many things but one of
the thing that impacts it pretty u

[05:15]
the thing that impacts it pretty u
widely is how much after you check raise
your opponent will three bet. So
essentially sometimes they just have to
let's say they see a two big blind you
check raise six big blind and they have
to show 40 bigs you know with over pairs

[05:30]
to show 40 bigs you know with over pairs
with top pairs and a few bluffs and that
seems like something that rarely happens
and so you could think that's probably
unimportant. Um but in reality you tweak
that a little bit you make your opponent
shove a little bit less 50 bigs in your
face on the flop because like

[05:46]
face on the flop because like
realistically that doesn't happen very
often. um solver does it let's say 12%
you node lock to 8% or 7% and then
suddenly you can check raise maybe twice
as much from 18 to 36 so clearly that
was a ha moment when I verified it and I

[06:01]
was a ha moment when I verified it and I
did it many times and I was like okay
that's parameter is super sensitive and
there's there's a few like that on the
flip side any parameters you played
around with they were like hm this is
pretty useless

[06:15]
pretty useless
um well I I thank my selective memory
for not having anything in mind right
now. Um, yeah, I I probably tend to
forget them right away. Actually, I had
a similar experience with with what you
mentioned. It was uh uh we were we were

[06:30]
mentioned. It was uh uh we were we were
playing around with this exactly the
same spot was blind versus blind. I
would raise the flop. Um, and you know,
I would not have him three bet the flop,
right? So, I imagine, okay, well, if if
he if he if if I don't allow him to
three bet the flop, I should probably

[06:45]
three bet the flop, I should probably
just always raise, right? because he
cannot free bet. And then I was playing
around with the solver and I was like,
"Hey, he's not raising that much. I
would have imagined what's going on."
And then I figured out that the solver,
as smart as he is, he
pre-app he he he adapted. He was like,

[07:01]
pre-app he he he adapted. He was like,
"Okay, I cannot throw at the flop.
However, I can call your race." And then
suddenly on the turn, he had like a 50
to 60% dunking range. Like, exactly.
That [ __ ] you know, you
understand? Did did you ever have a sim
similar experience where basically the

[07:16]
similar experience where basically the
solver sort of outsmarted you? Yeah, for
sure. That's a good example that you
mentioning. We call actually that the
like the the the check raise of the
passive uh old man. That that's what we
call it the the check call turn lead.

[07:31]
call it the the check call turn lead.
You know, you see that I don't know all
old guys doing that on the parrot board.
They're gonna check call 105 and then
lead turn deuce. And basically they have
a trips. They just didn't dare to check
risk. But yeah, I've had similar
experiences where I thought I found
something and then solver found a way to

[07:47]
something and then solver found a way to
remind me that he's omnicient and
smarter than me and
humbling. It was a humbling experience.
Yeah. Uh wi with your engineering
mindset, you already mentioned uh that
it helped you studying, but I can also

[08:01]
it helped you studying, but I can also
imagine it helped you with your study
process and especially how you structure
it. How do you systematically approach
studying poker like from a engineer
mindset? Sure. Um, so like I said, I

[08:17]
mindset? Sure. Um, so like I said, I
like to deconstruct a topic. So for
example, what I do, I save all the handy
stories online where I have a question
where I'm not sure, right? And I put
them in categories and after a month I

[08:30]
them in categories and after a month I
look at which folder has the most handy
stories, right? If it's five bet spots
and I have one hand per year, I don't
really care. I'm not going to go into
that in in depth. But then there's BVB.
Maybe last month I had 20. Uh then I'm
like, okay, this is really a spot where

[08:45]
like, okay, this is really a spot where
I have a lot of uncertainties. And so
I'm going to tackle BVB limpot. And
yeah, I really like to have a global
overview frequencies, then I go in
depth, strategies, then I go in depth,
simplifications, I look at exploits. And
so I'm basically going to spend maybe

[09:01]
so I'm basically going to spend maybe
two weeks just doing BBB uh because I
really want to kind of finish that topic
before moving on.
So you kind of use your own uncertainty
in a spot as kind of a compass towards

[09:15]
in a spot as kind of a compass towards
what you have to put work in.
Yes. Uh I do either that or what I've
done for example we did a map with a
friend Kenny Hollard. Um we did a map of
what nodes impact the win rate and in in

[09:32]
what nodes impact the win rate and in in
in uh which fashion. So basically we had
three bet pots, PVB, single race pot,
you know, everything you can think of.
And then we took a big database and we
kind of looked, okay, three bet pots,

[09:47]
kind of looked, okay, three bet pots,
they involve that many big blind, you
know, over time, uh BVB, that many big
blind on the flop for like, etc., etc.
Uh and then you cross that with the
frequency of the spot, right? Single

[10:00]
frequency of the spot, right? Single
race spot, small parts but very frequent
blah blah blah. We crossed everything
and the answer was basically how much
does that node impact your win rate. Is
it a lot? Is it medium? Is it not at
all? Like I mentioned six big pots. The
pots are giant but it never happens. So

[10:15]
pots are giant but it never happens. So
it doesn't impact your win rate at all.
Right? And so basically we did that and
then we just I just prioritize. Okay,
I'm just going to tackle what impacts my
win rate the most. That's where I want
to get really good. Then I went second
layer. What impacts the win the min rate
the win rate like you know in a medium

[10:31]
the win rate like you know in a medium
fashion. Uh and I probably never got to
the the small stuff. No six back pots.
No six pot. I'm a fish in six pot. Uh
actually it's very similar. We we had a
podcast with um with Patrick Howard and

[10:46]
podcast with um with Patrick Howard and
I think we talked similar like in a
similar fashion. Then we talked about
textures. Then we talked about mono
boards and then I asked him a question
about it. He said, "I don't know and I
don't care. It never happens." Yeah.
Which which was a good answer. Like in
in cash games like I use a very very

[11:01]
in cash games like I use a very very
similar approach. Frequency of spots uh
pot size. What you mentioned like your
own skill level is definitely a variable
to take in consideration. I think also
the skill level of your opponent is a
very interesting one. So in general,
it's worth putting more time into a spot

[11:16]
it's worth putting more time into a spot
where on average the population leaks
the most because basically then your
return of investment of putting time in
that spot because you can come up with
better exploits. You know, there's more
to gain. So there's like a couple of
variables here. Obviously in cash is a
bit easier because it's always the same.
How do you then measure in phases of the

[11:32]
How do you then measure in phases of the
tournament? Yeah. Yeah, that's
definitely complex. Um I think that was
a good analogy, a good example you gave.
For example, recently I started to work
way more on postrop ICM and that's kind

[11:45]
way more on postrop ICM and that's kind
of a new topic. It's kind of a new world
uh that opened to us recently with
solvers being super fast and we can now
really study that part of the game
efficiently. Uh but that's clearly a
topic where if you would if you watch

[12:00]
topic where if you would if you watch
streams even high stakes um you see
people doing a lot of stuff nobody knows
if it's good. And that's kind of what
you're mentioning, right? If you put 20
hours there, you're going to become the
best ICM postal player in the world.

[12:15]
best ICM postal player in the world.
Honestly, like I'm oversimplifying, but
that's a little bit how it feels right
now. In one year, it's going to be
different, of course. Um so yeah that's
a good way to also I think direct or
study um or at least I think it's a
really rewarding one because like you

[12:30]
really rewarding one because like you
mentioned you you end up having a big
edge after 20 hours of study whereas if
you want to have a big edge in single
race big line you have to put you know
100 I remember actually we also did a
podcast with with Jono and I think he he

[12:45]
podcast with with Jono and I think he he
mentioned 80% of a study is pre flop and
ICM because he says that's that's like
where where ref is going to be by far
the most frequent, right? And ICM is
going to have the biggest impact in
terms of on your win rate. Would you
would you say your your study ratio is

[13:01]
would you say your your study ratio is
is similar? No, I don't think so. I
don't do so much pre flop. Um, and yeah,
I'm more of a post flop studier, if you
might say. Uh I do ICM of course so
maybe something like 20% pre flop

[13:19]
maybe something like 20% pre flop
um 40%
ICM including post flop and 40% post
flop
GPV you mentioned that nowadays it
become is or at least we have now a

[13:31]
become is or at least we have now a
model to study right with postlop ICM
when that came out any any any
realizations you had like oh I was I was
I was pretty bad at so many so many so
many textures I was betting way too
often um as a covered stack for example

[13:49]
often um as a covered stack for example
so many textures I wasn't leading as a
covering stack from the big blind uh so
many textures I wasn't putting big bet
you know in as the big stack so the big

[14:01]
you know in as the big stack so the big
stack can actually play pretty splashy
in some spots uh and I didn't think that
would be the case because we always have
the wide range we face tight range Um
but that doesn't really matter in some
spots where we overrealize our equity uh

[14:15]
spots where we overrealize our equity uh
they have a big risk premium so they
overfold or obluffs you know are making
more money and we end up being splashy
with a lot of big bets. So yeah lots of
spots where I learned a
lot if you I feel like you know
especially in entities because it's so
it's so diverse so complex there's so

[14:30]
it's so diverse so complex there's so
many so many things going on it's really
valuable to zoom out. So if you if you
look at what you learned in posttop ICM
and you kind of zoom out what's what's
kind of the main principle or the kind
of the main takeaway that people should
should keep in mind because like all the

[14:46]
should keep in mind because like all the
specific spot that you mentioned they
all have to do with the amount of
pressure you can you can put on your
opponent given given the ICM
restrictions right that's kind of the
the the the bigger topic. Yeah. Yeah.
Exactly. That's the zoom out. Uh the

[15:00]
Exactly. That's the zoom out. Uh the
zoom out is the biggest icing pressure
you have on yourself. So the biggest
rispium, however you call it, the
biggest pressure, the less you want to
put money into the pot. Um on textures
where the nuts is going to change,

[15:15]
where the nuts is going to change,
right? So on a ace queen six rainbow, if
we have a tight range, we can have big
bets, everything that's fine. But on
those textures where the nuts is going
to change. So let's take a king 56 flush
draw. Now that's a completely different

[15:31]
draw. Now that's a completely different
story because on many turns and rivers
uh we don't want to stack off anymore
with aces and ace king. And when we have
a big pressure these are the flops where
I feel like population bets way too
much. I was betting way too much.

[15:45]
much. I was betting way too much.
Sometimes we have to check back a ton
even some ai boards a45 you know those
kind of texture. So when we have a big
pressure, don't bet too much those
textures. And then vice versa, when you
are the big stack and the other guy uh

[16:01]
are the big stack and the other guy uh
is going to under realize equity because
he has a big pressure, you can easily
bet pretty much any board uh range like
versus the big guy. There's a few
exceptions, but yeah, that's that's a
pretty interesting finding because like

[16:15]
pretty interesting finding because like
in in cash obviously because the SPR in
general is bigger like the equity
retention and how the N is going to
change is way more important. I always
thought that in tournaments because you
know SPR is smaller it doesn't really
matter but now you've thrown ICM in the
mix and now now it flips again. So that

[16:30]
mix and now now it flips again. So that
that's that's why ICMS is very very uh
tournaments is very interesting because
you think you know something and then
you add a new parameter right a new
variable to the equation and then it
suddenly does something else. Is that
also something that keeps you excited

[16:45]
also something that keeps you excited
like from from kind of digging into your
story you seem like a very curious and
and motivated guy. You you really seem
to really love poker. Is it is it
because the complexity of it? Yeah, I
think so. Of course, there's, you know,
all the good hormones you get when you

[17:01]
all the good hormones you get when you
deep run and when you win, and that's
super exciting, but I don't think I
would be that deep in your game. That
would be super simple. Like, it's like
you said, it's very exciting to keep
learning. Is that also one of the reason

[17:15]
learning. Is that also one of the reason
why you you chose I don't know how
conscious this choice was to play MTTS
for example compared to cash games
which from what it sounds like you know
obviously it has its own type of depths
but it is has less is less I remember we

[17:31]
but it is has less is less I remember we
had a podcast with I think it was good
enough he said cash game is deeper and
entities are wider I thought it was a
pretty interesting interesting
comparison yeah definitely yeah I for me
it was just more to play MTS like I

[17:45]
it was just more to play MTS like I
basically started with sit and goes
because cash game was yeah a little bit
boring for me and s and goes was like a
tournament but that if you just want to
play one hour and a half that's fine uh
uh and and because of being at
university that that was the way I was

[18:00]
university that that was the way I was
playing poker uh but yeah it's mostly
for the fun and the probably the
diversity of of the spots like you
mentioned um but I think it's just you
know naturally just more exciting to
have a final table uh being able to win
big and then those kind of stuff. Um,

[18:15]
big and then those kind of stuff. Um,
that's probably what got me in. As a as
an engineer, uh, very structured,
systematic, how do you go about the
process of continuous improvement? I
feel like many players leave improving
as a player up to kind of randomness

[18:32]
as a player up to kind of randomness
like wherever they feel like they should
put time. Now, you already kind of
mentioned, right, for example, that your
study approach is way more systematic.
you put more time into the spots that uh
uh that get you the highest return. How

[18:46]
uh that get you the highest return. How
do you approach
uh improving as a
player in terms of like the whole the
whole spectrum? Yeah. So I think for
sure there's probably one big league of

[19:01]
sure there's probably one big league of
a good part of the population, the pros,
right, that that don't maybe accept the
truth that is that if you want to be
competitive, you you have to evolve with
the game and with the population. Um,

[19:16]
the game and with the population. Um,
for me honestly, I would say the the
key, the number one key is just
discipline because I know I have to do
it if I want to stay competitive. Now,
it's fun to discover something. It's fun
to sometimes find uristics and stuff. U

[19:31]
to sometimes find uristics and stuff. U
I also like coaching a lot, which I will
mention in a in a minute. But honestly,
eventually I do it because I have to do
it. If I could just play main events
across the world and be the best player
in the world, that's probably what I
would do. Um but realistically speaking,

[19:46]
would do. Um but realistically speaking,
I know I have to put in the work and so
I just do it because I have to do it. Um
but I kind of found the form the magic
formula for me when you say really how
basically do I practically doing uh do
it is coaching. Uh I realized a few

[20:02]
it is coaching. Uh I realized a few
years ago that
coaching forces me puts some kind of
positive pressure on me where you know I
book a session with somebody and they
want to work on post flop ICM I have to
know my stuff. I have to do some

[20:16]
know my stuff. I have to do some
researches beforehand and I'm going to
get some tough questions and sometimes
I'm not going to know it. I'm going to
do the research afterwards and so
eventually coaching really pushes me to
evolve as a player with some kind of
positive pressure where I don't have to
decide myself hey today it's Friday I

[20:31]
decide myself hey today it's Friday I
have to study six hours. Um yeah for me
that works really well.
How do you structure a coaching session?
Um so it really depends what kind of
students what kind of programs but

[20:45]
students what kind of programs but
essentially let's say it's a one-on-one
and the student wants to work on a
specific topic for example BVB limpot
um usually what I do because now after a
few years I start to have like a pretty
extensive library of material and so I

[21:01]
extensive library of material and so I
take the material I have and then we go
in together and I'm going to say okay
this is what I have um these are the
important stuff. Where are you at in
your journey? What do you know? What's
your strategy in that spot? You know, uh

[21:15]
your strategy in that spot? You know, uh
we can we kind of feel where he is at.
Um and then we start from there and we
at the same time deepen the knowledge,
right? And say, hey, look, there's this
strategy or there's this uristics and
there's this stuff. And also we focus on

[21:30]
there's this stuff. And also we focus on
their population because you know a cash
gamer transitioning to MTT or a live you
know player in USA or an online rag or
live player in Cambodia. All those guys

[21:45]
live player in Cambodia. All those guys
they play different population and so we
kind of focus on their population and
we're like okay what are the main
exploits we can get in that node right?
How is your population playing? Are they
doing that too often or not enough? and
we find exploits right away. So that's

[22:00]
we find exploits right away. So that's
kind of how I would structure it. So we
start from theory, equilibrium,
overview, we go a little bit deeper,
more theory, more accuracy, and then we
switch to exploits versus
population. Yeah, I like that. I like
that structure. I feel like especially
in the past, for example, I don't know,

[22:16]
in the past, for example, I don't know,
I think you've been playing for 10
years, may maybe you were there already
in the pre-olver era, but in pre-olver
era, if you have like a pyramid, we're
only playing poker like here at the top.
We're just trying to figure out what our
opponent has and try to make an optimal
decision. It was pure exploitative base,
right? Yeah. But now with solvers, we

[22:30]
right? Yeah. But now with solvers, we
gained like a certain fundament below
that like if you don't know what your
opponent who your opponent is, basically
the level that we have that we fall back
on, I think is way more solid nowadays
if you have good theoretical
understanding. And from there you can,

[22:45]
understanding. And from there you can,
you know, make very good exploits,
right? Um, also in order to make a good
exploit, you first have to know what's
what's correct, right? I remember when
when some of us came out, I was doing
things that I thought people were doing
wrong that turns out it was not wrong.
So, I was just exploiting myself, right?

[23:01]
So, I was just exploiting myself, right?
Um I'm I'm really curious how someone
with an engineer mindset like yourself
approaches the process of like building
that foundation, right? Let's say the
process of strategy building or strategy
development. How do you take like the

[23:15]
development. How do you take like the
raw theory like so from solvers or data
and turn that into something practical
that you can actually apply to the
tables? I think that definitely
something people struggle with, right?
That that translation of okay, I have
this in theory. How do I turn this into
a practical strategy that I can start

[23:30]
a practical strategy that I can start
applying? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Uh
I would say like so I come from just
pre-solver maybe when they started to be
more coming out but not super popular
and the guy who kind of told me MTT when

[23:46]
and the guy who kind of told me MTT when
I was transitioning from sen go it was
purely exploitative as well really like
you think he overfolds bluff range you
feel you think he under bluffs fold
range like really very exploitative then
I got to studying I really like the

[24:00]
I got to studying I really like the
baseline because then I could tweak a
parameter like I told you and in game I
could decide, hey, I think that guy's
going to overfold. It's just so hard to
defend here. I'm just going to bluff a
little bit more often every single time.
Um, I want to stay focused on your
question, but it's because it it remind

[24:16]
question, but it's because it it remind
me of some kind of journey. Then after a
few years, there was really one year
where I got too deep in the solver and I
started to only play or try to emulate
GTO and and and re replicate thing I
would learn but in equilibrium not

[24:32]
would learn but in equilibrium not
exploiting enough having a little bit
paranoia like oh if I you know if I fold
this combo he's going to exploit me
because I overfold. Um and that year
coincidence or not that was my worst
year in like seven years. uh stopping to

[24:47]
year in like seven years. uh stopping to
listen to my intuition, stopping to play
exploitatively and try to play
equilibrium was my worst year and then I
had talks with some people and then
again they was like hey but how were you
winning before and like I was more based
on intuition uh studying a lot but

[25:01]
on intuition uh studying a lot but
exploiting a lot and like and why did
you stop and anyway we question and then
I came back to the collision okay nobody
plays perfectly there's no equilibrium
nobody's omnicient um and so it's really
important I think starting to get back
to your question um to study, know the

[25:17]
to your question um to study, know the
baseline, know how parameters are
moving, but the end goal and the only
goal is that at the table you own your
opponents day and night. And so if we
play one night together, of course you
can do whatever you want. Um it's

[25:30]
can do whatever you want. Um it's
different than if you play three years
together online, but there's still so
many nodes that it's just naturally
going to be really hard for you as a
human to play correctly. And the more
you can identify those hot spots, the

[25:45]
you can identify those hot spots, the
more you can put pressure in those spots
and over bluff slightly, overfold
slightly because it's really hard to
find the bluffs, that kind of stuff. Um,
yeah, for me the goal is really to
understand the game very deep. That's
why I study. And then in game, it's a
lot of one or zeros. There's a lot of,

[26:02]
lot of one or zeros. There's a lot of,
you know, over bluff, overfold,
uh, over check back, but it's not like
randomized
67% calling on the river. For me, that
makes no sense. I I don't think that's
exist in in practice. I think you always

[26:16]
exist in in practice. I think you always
face ones or zeros.
Yeah, because I I I agree with that.
Like sometimes when I hear or see
someone roll, I'm like, okay, so when
you roll, there's two assumptions that
you make. You're assuming that this guy

[26:31]
you make. You're assuming that this guy
plays that GTO that you need to defend
that GTO that overalling this hand more
than 40% of the time or less is actually
going to be a leak. And second of all,
you're telling me now that you know this
hand is 40% calling and 60% folding.

[26:45]
hand is 40% calling and 60% folding.
Both things I don't think will ever
apply. There's one instant in which I do
actually like an RNG, uh, which is, for
example, let's say you're a station on
the river and you just always press
call. Yeah. Then sometimes you should
maybe when you feel like it's close it's

[27:00]
maybe when you feel like it's close it's
probably not you you understand your
intuition is a little bit biased then
running the RNG in in those spots at
least folding your hand 50% of the time
if you really don't if you really don't
know then at least you can protect
yourself from your bias constantly
impacting your game if you understand

[27:15]
impacting your game if you understand
what I mean for example I'm naturally a
bit more risk averse so I would find a
reason to fold so when I feel like it's
close I'll run the RNG and do it 50/50
not because I need to defend 50/50 but
just to protect
myself if that makes sense. Yeah, for

[27:30]
myself if that makes sense. Yeah, for
sure. I think it's smart. I think
there's a few nodes where RNG makes
sense, namely pre flop when you know you
play that all the time. Let's say you
play bet from the big blind, very
shallow, you know the combos, but you
know it's 20% here and there. Uh yeah,
it's the same if you don't want to

[27:46]
it's the same if you don't want to
overdo it. Every time you think, "Oh,
that's a great spot. I'm going to three
bet." Um if you don't want to overdo it,
RNG makes a lot of sense. But I agree
with you.
Rivers honestly I would say it shouldn't
apply. Like we do it because we are

[28:02]
apply. Like we do it because we are
maybe afraid to make a mistake. Uh but I
would say
that in practice versus the ranges we
play, there's probably never RNG, right?
If we would have an AI bot that could

[28:17]
If we would have an AI bot that could
know everything that's happening, he
would probably never RNG. He would have
pure decisions with everything. Yeah.
And he would he would outsmart everyone.
So for for sure he would he would just
completely annihilate you. Uh you you

[28:31]
completely annihilate you. Uh you you
mentioned that that year where you went
too far into into theory, right? You you
went a bit too far and later you kind of
found found the balance even though that
year wasn't great. What were like some
things that you did learn from going

[28:45]
things that you did learn from going
very deep in theory that you took with
you? H but maybe applied in a in in a
more practical way. Yeah. Um I think
just all the study I did was not for
nothing and I learned a lot of stuff. I

[29:01]
nothing and I learned a lot of stuff. I
was just not utilizing it properly. But
the year after I had all that knowledge
that I accumulated but now I was able to
think as a strategical mindset. How am I
going to use it? How am I going to

[29:16]
going to use it? How am I going to
exploit those guys? How am I going to
deviate? uh in final tables, you know, I
don't need to take something that's
close because there's nothing that's
close. Either that guy is under three
betting, either he's over three bidding.
So, I just starting to use my intuition

[29:30]
So, I just starting to use my intuition
more. Uh but I had much more baseline.
So, you know, I had more spots where I
knew how I could exploit. So, that was a
good thing. Uh I just had to wake up on
how to use it.
Do you feel like you also got kind of

[29:45]
Do you feel like you also got kind of
lost because for example obviously a
solver very important tool. I feel like
there's multiple things you can learn
from a solver. You can learn indeed like
how the parameters impact strategies.
You can kind of try to understand why
certain hand classes prefer certain
things. So there's a lot of things but

[30:00]
things. So there's a lot of things but
then you have like the actual range
construction like you said the frequency
which which is a bit more built around
GTO strategy whereas the other things
are more poker theory. you think you got
a bit too far down trying to play a GTO
strategy and later when you evolved just

[30:15]
strategy and later when you evolved just
like huh the actual GTO strategy doesn't
really matter but the underlying
concepts are very valuable.
Yeah. Yeah. It's exactly that. It's uh
being too much into the overall strategy
um into the frequency into you know

[30:30]
um into the frequency into you know
never getting exploited and so yeah
really like an overall strategy like you
say. Yeah.
A lot of uh a lot of players you know
they talk about the importance of
simplifying your strategy. I think

[30:45]
simplifying your strategy. I think
that's also something that you mentioned
in terms of making it practical.
Simplification however can have very
different uh can mean different things
to different people right how simple for
you might not be the version of simple
for for someone else. Do you have maybe

[31:01]
for for someone else. Do you have maybe
an example of how you simplify and kind
of where or when do you think
simplification is overdone and kind of
hurting your EV? Yeah. Okay. Um I think
typical example would be for me in

[31:16]
typical example would be for me in
position versus big line especially
from a middle position and early
position when we have a tight range um
that is very strong on many boards.
Oversimplifying would be you can bet

[31:30]
Oversimplifying would be you can bet
range one/ird every board and I think
nowadays it's not great because people
have been facing CBET 1/3 for 15 years
and it's it's hardly challenging from
big blind anymore right 15 years ago it

[31:47]
big blind anymore right 15 years ago it
was killing because people were
overfolding and under check raising and
everything but it's not the case anymore
um and if you just do CBET range but
having two sizings one very small one 20
25 one very big one 100 125

[32:03]
25 one very big one 100 125
uh first of all you gain EV even versus
GTO bot it's like a more advanced better
strategy by a significant margin so it's
not like having five size compared to
four where it wouldn't matter like this

[32:16]
four where it wouldn't matter like this
is actually a real difference uh but
second layer is that the human is now
going to be way more challenged when you
be hund um and when you B20 as well
because now that you have the Bund B20

[32:31]
because now that you have the Bund B20
is actually weaker and so they should
attack it way more uh but probably
people don't think oh it B 20 but I
remember 6 months ago he behind that
spot so I have to defend more aggressive
you know no so that would be an example
where people oversimplify and miss out

[32:46]
where people oversimplify and miss out
on quite a lot of EV in my opinion I'm
curious like when when when building
strategies uh like you already just
mentioned right imposition is initial
razor you you you found like a strategy
basically that the population has a

[33:00]
basically that the population has a
tougher time defending against, right?
When building strategies, do you
approach situations differently? Whether
you're the aggressor, so like the
initial razor or the defender since like
when you're the aggressor, like in the
spot that you you just explained, you
kind of drive the action, right? You put

[33:16]
kind of drive the action, right? You put
you enforce a strategy that your
opponent has difficult time playing
against on the other. Whereas if you're
the big blind, you have to react. So do
you approach studying these situations
in a different way? Yeah. Um I think the

[33:30]
in a different way? Yeah. Um I think the
main difference is that there's more
uncertainty in what kind of strategies
are being used when you are in big blind
because it doesn't matter which size you
face. You eventually don't really know
at what frequency he uses it. There's
tails of course if it's 25% on NI board

[33:46]
tails of course if it's 25% on NI board
is probably range but you know on some
other textures it's harder. So what I
like to do is just
uh study how I'm supposed to react in
different situation. So let's

[34:00]
different situation. So let's
say it's a dynamic texture queen 96
flush row and I face B 23. Um next time
I want to study that spot from the big
blind, hopefully not while I'm playing,

[34:15]
blind, hopefully not while I'm playing,
uh is going to be look at the solver and
look at the different options. First of
all, what if my opponent can check bet
small B23 and then I see, okay, this is
my defense. Next option, what if my
opponent just check B23. Okay, these are
the differences. Next scenario, what if

[34:31]
the differences. Next scenario, what if
my opponent best range 23? Uh this is
how I react, right? And so you get
again, you know, three baselines. Um and
then in game depending on your opponent
you can make assumptions and maybe you

[34:45]
you can make assumptions and maybe you
merge number one and number three uh
check raise more but do this and do
that. So there's more guessing but again
having a couple baselines under your
sleeves it's going to help you in game
figure out even if you have to merge two
solutions

[35:00]
solutions
together. I'm always a big fan of when
when when I study spots, I always like
to first start I always give people the
recommendation to first start with the
the spot looking at it from the
aggressor perspective because it will
really help you when you're the defender
because the defender is more about

[35:16]
because the defender is more about
trying to figure out what your opponent
is doing wrong and exploit that. And in
order to know that you first must have
studied, okay, what was correct in the
first place, right? And usually when you
look at the solver, especially in like
for example this situation, you say,
"Okay, queen 96. Okay, I'm going to play
a mix between check one/3 and big bet.

[35:32]
a mix between check one/3 and big bet.
Okay, I'm going to be very sensitive to
screw up this range construction here
and there, right?" And when studying
that, you can then use that knowledge
when you're in the big blind and be
like, well, he's also human, so most
likely he will also have trouble, you

[35:45]
likely he will also have trouble, you
know, making his big bat a bit too
equity driven, a bit too strong, and his
his weak bat a bit too full of [ __ ] So,
so from there you can uh you can make I
think very very good exploits. Um yeah,
100% agree. One struggle I actually see
a lot coming up also in our in our own

[36:01]
a lot coming up also in our in our own
coaching community is how to optimally
document uh your study notes and your
findings, right? Uh have you found any
particularly effective ways to document,
retain and structure poker knowledge
over time? Yeah, actually I think that's

[36:16]
over time? Yeah, actually I think that's
also something I take from university.
uh more structure approach, you know,
taking notes, taking doing summaries. Um
definitely I've started to do that
pretty early. I mean, I think there are
different tools. I'm not like the most

[36:32]
different tools. I'm not like the most
um like I have a method. I like it. I
keep using it. I'm not going to look
every year for a new tool. Uh but I use
a document like Quip, for example, where
I can do all my summaries. You can put

[36:45]
I can do all my summaries. You can put
screenshots, you can put links, you can
put like a few things.
Um, yeah, I I usually do one document
for one node. So, you know, three bet
small blind versus in position, that's
going to be one big document. Big blind

[37:00]
going to be one big document. Big blind
versus in position, that's going to be
another document. Um, so I have a bunch
of documents. Then I have a document
that I called Mark's daily spot, which
is just anything I come across that I
don't know, it's like a river five flush

[37:15]
don't know, it's like a river five flush
lead all in with range. Uh, okay. That's
like weird and interesting, but halfly
useless, but I didn't know the answer
and and I learned something new. So
maybe I copy paste it in the martm spot
and when I have 15 minutes I want to

[37:30]
and when I have 15 minutes I want to
mental warm up or something, I just
scroll and look at the I don't know the
five most recent spots for example that
I learned
something. That would be my method. Um,
but I have friends who have more
advanced method. For example, they do
memory cards. So everything they learn

[37:46]
memory cards. So everything they learn
they put in memory cards and then they
quiz themselves and it's it's very
dynamic. Only the wrong answers come
back with time. So you know it's it
increases memory retention like uh yeah
it's it's too advanced for me and I
don't like to uh do those small things

[38:02]
don't like to uh do those small things
but uh these guys are learning fast and
for them it works really a lot. So I
guess it depends on your style but there
are some great tools available I would
say. Yeah, we had a we had a podcast
with uh I think it was Yolan. He used to

[38:17]
with uh I think it was Yolan. He used to
be a memorization world champion. So
maybe if you want to learn something,
you can go check out that episode for
people interested. He also talked about
the like best tactics for like me memory
retention and stuff. Uh was was
definitely uh very interesting. So what

[38:31]
definitely uh very interesting. So what
it sounds like you basically have the
book How Thomas plays poker like your
your baseline strategy, your foundation.
Yes. I think it's very important as well
that you mentioned that you have
summaries. So you have kind of a summary

[38:46]
summaries. So you have kind of a summary
on how to play every spot because
sometimes I feel like if you study a lot
and you have a lot of pieces to the
puzzle, but you don't summarize it at
the end, aka you decide what your
strategy is going to be and put all the
the puzzles together. If you then find
something in game, you can have all

[39:00]
something in game, you can have all
these pieces of information, but you
haven't really structured it. How
important is like that summary for you?
Yeah, for me it's pretty important.
There are so many spots that are so
complicated and for me it has helped to
have that summary because I like to

[39:15]
have that summary because I like to
understand why something is happening.
But yeah, eventually like you say, you
understand a 100 stuff. But eventually
it kind of helps if you have just one
small table with four different textures
of ASI, you know, ace high X is low is

[39:31]
of ASI, you know, ace high X is low is
midm. Okay, that's three categories. Uh
and then you have big uristics. Hey, on
all of these we actually have big bets.
Uh but on these ones we never have big
bets. So small table, you know, few
simplified strategies for me that's very
helpful.

[39:47]
Being organized uh off the table also
will help you uh and will translate to
being structured in your in your in your
thought process right in game. How do
you structure your decision- making

[40:00]
you structure your decision- making
process while playing? Are you like
deliberate about the key factors that
you want to consider and then how has
this evolved for you over the years? Um
probably dare I deviate from the
stereotype engineer. I'm more like a

[40:17]
stereotype engineer. I'm more like a
little bit I'm not going to say feeling
but I'm like okay I'm like this is this
this is the spot he's supposed to do
that he's supposed to see that much that
sizing I'm supposed to check raise that
but he's supposed to react that way uh
so it goes really fast of course I let

[40:31]
so it goes really fast of course I let
the infusion do the work uh and then I'm
like okay then I'm going to check race
that combo very aggressively because I
think that's the best way um and then I
already think okay that means on the
turn maybe I have to readapt but yeah I
don't really have like a list five

[40:45]
don't really have like a list five
questions like myself every river for
example um yeah I'm more like letting my
intuition do the work rather than
controlling the thought process
there's obviously you know intuition is

[41:00]
there's obviously you know intuition is
is very helpful right because if we
would really write down everything we
consider in a hand that that is indeed a
lot of thing right so if you make that a
conscious process will will burn out way
too much uh way way too much brain power
like I said there's infinite variables
we and think about blockers, bet sizing,

[41:16]
we and think about blockers, bet sizing,
timing tells game flow. There's so much
things to take in consideration. If you
had to rank like the most important
things to take in consideration when
making a decision to so like the thing
that has the greatest impact right on
the EV of your decision, what would be

[41:31]
the EV of your decision, what would be
at the top and what would be at like the
bottom of the
list? I think the top eventually is just
technical analysis of there is a
baseline. I think I know where it is and

[41:46]
baseline. I think I know where it is and
these are my assumptions on how it
deviates, right? And then that is for me
the most important. Sometimes it's there
other things. There's the profile. The
guy's I don't know 80 years old who
hasn't played a hand like there's other

[42:00]
hasn't played a hand like there's other
things that you know you kind of really
want to take into account over that. But
then the answer is just okay he has way
too many bluffs like that's and I found
in my experience that that is the most
important thing to to hold on right he

[42:16]
important thing to to hold on right he
has
25 bluffing combos available per every
value combos and I know he's a nit when
it comes to value betting the answer is
just call like it doesn't really matter

[42:31]
just call like it doesn't really matter
anything else you know this is the most
important for me this the technical
side of of the the
equation. Um, the least
important or okay, for me personally, I

[42:45]
important or okay, for me personally, I
think it's uh uh physical tails. I'm
really not good at it
and sometimes it can, you know, uh, put
me in like question my my decision,
maybe confuse me, maybe go against what

[43:01]
maybe confuse me, maybe go against what
I thought was the right move. And
honestly, I'm just not good at it. So
now I disregard it. Um yeah, I just
disregard it. Now
you you do play you do play a lot of
life. Is that a area that maybe in the

[43:16]
life. Is that a area that maybe in the
future you'll be curious in exploring? I
I do understand what you mean. Like I've
been in a similar situation where I play
live very unfrequent then I sit and I
see him acting a certain way and then
it's like hey this probably means
something but I have no clue what it
means. So maybe I should try to ignore

[43:30]
means. So maybe I should try to ignore
it. But then like but I did see it. So
then it starts to you know it starts to
creep into my decision making like why
am I thinking about these things I have
no baseline I cannot I cannot know if
this is weaker or or strong. Yeah, I
have worked. I followed some program.
Um, it's just somehow feels like I'm not

[43:46]
Um, it's just somehow feels like I'm not
super talented at that. Now, I must say
that of course in high stakes, I think
it it's really hard to find reliable
tails or at least for me probably some
for some people it's not. Uh now of
course if I'm going to play softer

[44:00]
course if I'm going to play softer
fields, lower stakes, WSOP main event
like in those tournaments, yeah, you can
see sometime some um sizing tails, some
sorry, some physical tails, some some
timing tails and I will use them, but
honestly, usually they are like second

[44:16]
honestly, usually they are like second
or third degree because those guys who
have tails probably have giant leagues
in every single decision that they make.
So again you know the number one
parameter is going to be just uh the
technical analysis of the spot.

[44:32]
technical analysis of the spot.
It's quite interesting that that you
mentioned about uh about intuition
earlier because I figured like engineers
you know they will naturally be drawn
towards data logic but obviously there
is data logic right it's it's it's what
you put it your time in offame and it

[44:47]
you put it your time in offame and it
feels like the time that you've put it
in offgame right in that document we
discussed right where Thomas how Thomas
how Thomas plays poker that allows you
to then in game
go you don't have to think about your
base answer anymore so it sounds like

[45:00]
base answer anymore so it sounds like
then in game, you can just look at the
new information that comes towards you,
which seems to be more like the
exploitative layer, but you you can only
do that because you don't have to think
about the fundamentals anymore. Correct.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah. Overall,
overall, I would say is correct. Now,

[45:16]
overall, I would say is correct. Now,
there are still spots where I do have to
consciously think about the baseline.
I'm like, what was it again here? Can I
can I do that? What was the logic
behind? Like, you know, it's really a
complex game like like you mentioned.
And so sometimes I do have to go back

[45:30]
And so sometimes I do have to go back
there. Uh but eventually I will still
end up in do I think I can exploit
somebody somehow like I I always like to
play with those uh
things. feel like I have something else
in mind but tough remember what

[45:46]
in mind but tough remember what
what are like some of your favorite uh
tendencies or like that that you try to
look out for in your opponents there you
from which you know like hey if I can
figure this out on my opponent that that
will lead me to a a good plus V spot

[46:02]
will lead me to a a good plus V spot
um I would say from both sides so when
I'm the aggressor I'm usually going to
think what is the defend what is the def
the bottom combos that have to defend

[46:15]
the bottom combos that have to defend
like what are the toughest defend in his
range in his strategy when I do a
certain sizing and then I'm just going
to wonder okay is he actually going to
do that or not uh I think that is an
information we can use a lot flop river

[46:31]
information we can use a lot flop river
um and then when we are facing the
aggression I think it's a combination of
how many unnatural bluffs does he have
to have like does he have to have a lot
of zero equity jack high nothing bluffs

[46:47]
of zero equity jack high nothing bluffs
on the turn and on the river or not? Uh
that's very important because some
profiles are not very comfortable you
know starting to blast off jack high
nothing turn and river. Um and then the
second one in contrast to that is you

[47:01]
second one in contrast to that is you
know how thin does he have to value bet?
Is he supposed to bet bet bet bet bet
bet bet bet bet bet bet bet bet bet bet
bet bet bet bet bet bet all in with
almost any top pair for 60 bigs? If yes,
that's pretty hard. And so you can
contrast those two usually and sometimes
it leads you to a very clear decision.

[47:16]
it leads you to a very clear decision.
Uh easy to bluff, hard to value or the
opposite very hard to bluff, easy to
value, you know, and then you have a
pure decision with your hand.
Yeah, it's a great answer. So both kind
of both again stem from first knowing

[47:31]
of both again stem from first knowing
knowing what's correct, right? you know
that this is a spot where the bluffs
have to come from a part of the range
that's often unnatural so easy to be
missed then on average if you look at
okay best case scenario he does reach
them and my call might be like zero EV
right it's just indifferent hand in

[47:46]
right it's just indifferent hand in
theory but if he does miss my hand loses
a lot so probably not really a spot
where I'm going to make a lot of money
whereas in the in the other scenario
that you said okay well you know this is
a spot where people's fold allowance is
very low right they have to defend all

[48:01]
very low right they have to defend all
these hands that are They're very hard
to defend. So, it's more likely that if
he defends correctly, it's my hand's
going to be zero, but it's way more
likely that it's going to overfold. So,
we should probably always pull a
trigger. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.

[48:15]
Intuition can often be used as like a
super weapon, right? When you're really
in the flow and it's it's it's pointing
in the right direction, you feel like
poker is easy, right? You make good
decisions. But sometimes when things are
not really going your way, especially
when you're in a downswing or you made a

[48:31]
when you're in a downswing or you made a
couple of bad decisions in a row, it
feels like sometimes my intuition kind
of lets me down, right? I think I I've
mentioned that earlier. For example,
naturally, if I'm in a downswing, I
become a bit more risk averse. So, my
intuition just says fold, fold, fold,

[48:45]
intuition just says fold, fold, fold,
fold. He sets everywhere. You know, it's
it turns very very pessimistic. Uh how
do you make sure that your intuition is
always spot on? And what are like signs
that it's going either towards to the
left because I I'm also sensitive
towards the other side, right? If every

[49:01]
towards the other side, right? If every
like I I suddenly see hero calls
everywhere. So I feel like it's
impossible to always stay centered. So
maybe we should talk about uh uh how can
we spot the difference between good
intuition and the impact of bias and how
do we try to steer back to the middle

[49:16]
do we try to steer back to the middle
and stay in the middle uh as as as much
as possible. Yeah, I think it's a great
topic, great question. Um yeah, it make
me think that one of the way I think I
notice that I'm not purely listening to

[49:32]
notice that I'm not purely listening to
my intuition. That's usually when
there's some kind of dissonance in how I
feel. So for example, I'm on the river.
Uh somebody put me all in and I have to
think do I call or not? And there's

[49:45]
think do I call or not? And there's
different part of me that kind of feels
that they want to do different things.
And that's usually because there's
something else in intuition, right? Your
intuition is telling you one or the
other. And then a fear is telling you
the opposite. So maybe your intuition

[50:02]
the opposite. So maybe your intuition
tells you it's a bluff. Uh like it's so
easy to overbluff. You know it it's hard
to value bet. But then your fear is
telling you it's 17 left in that 10k.
The field is soft. I have an edge. I

[50:17]
The field is soft. I have an edge. I
really don't want to bust right now.
uh you know and then those two like
which one do you choose? Um and I think
also how how do you know which one is
talking? Yeah, exactly. How do you know?
Yeah. Oh yeah, of course. Which one do

[50:30]
Yeah. Oh yeah, of course. Which one do
you choose? You know it if you know
which one is intuition for sure. Yeah,
you're right. Which one is talking? Um I
had to learn it. I mean by fail and and
like trial and failure. Um I had to fail
many times and I had to question like

[50:47]
many times and I had to question like
you know I had that feeling many times
like I knew what I had to do and I
didn't do it. Why is that? How can it be
possible that that I know what is the
best play and I don't do it? What
happened there? It's not logical. And no

[51:00]
happened there? It's not logical. And no
it's not it's not rational. It's
emotional. And so I made the mistakes
many times and then eventually I
understood okay I have to perform
emotionally really at my best in order
to apply all that work that I do in the
lab otherwise it's useless. If you're

[51:16]
lab otherwise it's useless. If you're
the most knowledgeable player in the
world and you cannot apply it because of
emotions it's a waste. Um so yeah just
basically start to I started to be more
um listening to the small signs. What

[51:31]
um listening to the small signs. What
can be fear? um like what am I fearing?
Is it busting and the end of the fun? Is
it looking silly in front of other high
stakers? Uh you know, I felt them all.
And so eventually I just developed some
kind of more sensitivity to those things

[51:47]
kind of more sensitivity to those things
and I can recognize them. And if I can
recognize him, then I'm like, okay, I'm
afraid to look silly uh
by bluffing this nonsense combo, but at
the same time, I really think it's a

[52:01]
the same time, I really think it's a
good play. And so I nowadays I'm pretty
happy of my performance and I feel like
I always go with what I think is the
right play. Um, and that means that I
fail more often listening to my
intuition. And that is more rewarding

[52:18]
intuition. And that is more rewarding
for me than failing because I didn't
listen to my intuition. And then you
have regrets, right? So I'm more
satisfied with the failure nowadays
because I followed my gut.
Um, yeah. When you say listen, is it

[52:33]
Um, yeah. When you say listen, is it
like a a pattern in the type of chatter
you hear in your mind or is it when you
say listen, do you mean like listen to
what you're feeling in your body? Like
how is the the sensation in your body

[52:47]
how is the the sensation in your body
different when it's good intuition or
when it's fear? It's so hard to explain
honestly. I have to think, put myself in
the situation, see how I feel.
Somehow I have the feeling that yeah I

[53:02]
Somehow I have the feeling that yeah I
have this technical analysis that I feel
is right you know and that like I
basically I don't think too much I'm
like okay I'm pretty sure that is right
and I try not to listen too much the
rest what's going on all the fears and

[53:15]
rest what's going on all the fears and
all the stuff like I'm like okay I I I
hold on to that maybe I'm going to use
25 seconds just I'm I'm going to think
what I have for dinner tomorrow whatever
but I'm going to just Stick with that.
Stick with that initial technical

[53:31]
Stick with that initial technical
intuition, right? And not trying to find
excuses to uh act like my fears want me
to
act. I I like I'm I I feel like I uh I

[53:45]
act. I I like I'm I I feel like I uh I
can definitely relate a lot to what
you're saying.
Um I one thing that has helped me
actually I remember I was playing live
uh in Vegas. I don't play live that
often. So, in general, I can be a little
bit nervous. Uh, especially when, you

[54:00]
bit nervous. Uh, especially when, you
know, the pots get bigger, you have real
chips, you know, there's all stuff of
real stuff going on. And sometimes I
feel like I'm way too much in like a
fight or flight spot. Something that
really helped for me is that in in
indecision, I would I would literally
ask myself facts or thoughts and try to

[54:15]
ask myself facts or thoughts and try to
and try to make a difference between
those two. And it's kind of a check-in
moment that you try to stay with the
facts. You you're trying to check in
like, hey, is this facts or thoughts?
where I feel like if you don't check in,
your thoughts can just take over. And if
your thoughts are mainly fear driven,
I'm I'm sure players have experienced

[54:31]
I'm I'm sure players have experienced
this, but then sometimes the hand is
over, it's like, what the [ __ ] just
happened? It's almost like you you it's
it's gone black and it's like, you know,
the the fear or the emotions have taken
over like do these emotions still come
up for you or do you think at

[54:45]
up for you or do you think at
some moment you have sort of resolved
these fears, right? You you said, okay,
you listen to what are these fears? Do
you like give it a play so they don't
come up or do they still come up and you
learn like hey is it is it not a fact
this is just a thought that the fault is
fear driven let's stick to the fact is
it more a process like that or at some

[55:01]
it more a process like that or at some
point do you can you actually resolve it
that it doesn't come up anymore yeah I I
probably think you can resolve it that
it doesn't come up anymore um I don't
think I'm quite there yet however now it

[55:15]
think I'm quite there yet however now it
seems usually very obvious which one is
which and you So I like for example to
look at my card or at least one card
before it's my turn when it's a shot
clock tournament right so that I can
think I can start thinking and I don't
have to use a shot clock like a time

[55:31]
have to use a shot clock like a time
bank for silly pre flop decision um
let's say um hijack it's a final table
first card is a four and then lowjack
opens now I already know that maybe it's
a good spot to three bet a four suited

[55:46]
a good spot to three bet a four suited
uh maybe it's a big final table it's
high stakes there's a lot of good
players
you know, and right away I have those
two things coming up. I'm like, okay, I
know it's probably going to be a good
three bet, but I'm like, my body starts
to prepare and it's like, uh, we might
go to war with this for student here and

[56:02]
go to war with this for student here and
maybe I actually think it's a good three
bet five and you know, my body started
to prepare. I look on the reaction of
the body, but I just know already what
I'm going to do, right? I have decided
this is the right play but the body

[56:15]
this is the right play but the body
feels it and the body is like yeah this
is this is stressful uh but I have yeah
now I can easily feel the difference you
mentioned
um thinking thoughts or fact and I

[56:30]
um thinking thoughts or fact and I
thought that was really great and that
made me think of something I do
especially when I deep run is that I
meditate even just a few minutes uh at
every break even like three minutes Um,
and there's a couple reasons why I do
it. First one is just that the brain uh

[56:46]
it. First one is just that the brain uh
rests and regenerates much faster when
you meditate than when you sleep. So,
it's really really good, really positive
for the brain. If you do that five
times, 3 minutes AC throughout the day,

[57:01]
times, 3 minutes AC throughout the day,
it's going to have an impact on your
sharpness, on your focus, on your
stamina, everything. Uh but the second
reason is to do some kind of exercise
like you mentioned and sometimes I'm in
a deep run and there's a lot of emotions
and a lot of pressure and adrenaline and

[57:17]
and a lot of pressure and adrenaline and
then you know you close your eyes take a
few deep breath and then I ask myself
okay what is my edge here in this game?
Um what am I I'm okay I'm going to touch
that after. What is my edge? What are
the pressure points? What do I feel that

[57:30]
the pressure points? What do I feel that
I can do better than others? What are
the spots where I feel like they're
going to let the emotion take over? How
can I exploit that? Right? I do that for
one or two minutes and then I come back
on the game and then I'm like, "Oh my
god, I have to play like a degenerate
over here. Maybe the past 20 minutes I

[57:46]
over here. Maybe the past 20 minutes I
was too passive actually under the
pressure of the 12 left blah blah blah,"
you know. Um, so yeah, that helps me
disconnect, reenter. Feels like you gave
it you you g you gave your mind a
different perspective.
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. You you cut

[58:02]
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. You you cut
some hormones, cut cut some fears,
reenter, you know. Yeah. Keep the main

let's get back into our episode with

[59:33]
let's get back into our episode with
Thomas. I like that. Keep keep the main
thing the main thing. It's kind of like
the fact the facts are fun. Stay stay to
the fact. Um yeah, great stuff, Adam. Uh
this is a great time to include you in

[59:45]
this is a great time to include you in
the conversation. you as a peak
performance po coach. Uh actually there
was there there was something that
Thomas also said that I can definitely
relate to as well. Uh where he saw the
ace and he know this could end up in
like five battle win. This is like again
the fear, right? Fear often uh excels in

[1:00:02]
the fear, right? Fear often uh excels in
like the future, right? It's not in the
now, but it it excels in what could
happen. So I I I I mentioned earlier,
right, that when I'm in a downswing, I
have passive tendencies. It's exactly
for that reason. I'll find an excuse to
flat a hand that I should three bet just

[1:00:16]
flat a hand that I should three bet just
because fear sees three betting as a
potential bigger pot aka bigger threat
and therefore it's I find a reason the
RNG ruled the call for example you know
it's really funny then how why the [ __ ]

[1:00:31]
it's really funny then how why the [ __ ]
did I call well it was because fear
steered you towards finding a reason
that you didn't want to blow up the pot
because you you were not really feeling
confident right I feel like in general
confidence in all sports and especially
in poker, right? We see we see people go

[1:00:45]
in poker, right? We see we see people go
on heaters obviously there's partly just
the the cards fall right but I feel like
a very big part is just also well
everything is going right for them
they're in the flow right the cards that
they get dealt sure they fall a bit
better but what they do with it is also
way better right so I feel like that's a

[1:01:00]
way better right so I feel like that's a
very big part of poker that that I'm
sure Adam will touch into uh right now
with you Adam like how can we not I
guess I have two questions for you how
can we not get overwhelmed by all these
emotions, right? If you like emotions,

[1:01:16]
emotions, right? If you like emotions,
everyone struggles with that. Uh it's
also interesting what Thomas said like
yes, you're struggling now with these
emotion, but imagine your opponents,
right? Some sometimes we think it's just
us, but it's not only us. They're
they're also they're also afraid, right?
And we can use that to an advantage like

[1:01:30]
And we can use that to an advantage like
you said, oh, I should have been maybe
playing way more aggressive. Uh but how
how do you fix
a a mistake that you made that you look
at afterward like, oh yeah, I shouldn't
make this mistake. I know this, but
apparently I don't. H how do you fix

[1:01:45]
apparently I don't. H how do you fix
what you How do you fix a problem that's
actually not a problem because you think
you know, but apparently you don't. What
a topic. Wow. Okay, this one has been so
interesting listening to you guys map
out the whole framework of intuition
versus fear. As I was listening, I was

[1:02:01]
versus fear. As I was listening, I was
thinking what is like the dominant fear
in most situations? And it's protection
versus mistakes. It's like whether it's
a bad call, you just don't want to look
stupid, you don't want to lose. most
fears are really in how do I not make
the mistake? You guys were chatting
about RNGs earlier and kind of due to

[1:02:16]
about RNGs earlier and kind of due to
your frameworks. A lot of those are like
how do I not make a mistake? It's always
kind of on and not messing up. So then
we look at intuition and it was really
interesting hearing Thomas speak about
how you think about intuition and I was
getting the sense of I trust myself. I

[1:02:30]
getting the sense of I trust myself. I
trust myself in what my intuition feels
like. Now we we end up on a bit of
unsteady ground because the mind tries
to label intuition. It's like, well,
tell me all the stuff about intuition.
Like, now it kind of just feels a bit
different. Then we've got this fear
that's competing with intuition often.

[1:02:45]
that's competing with intuition often.
So, we've got to map it out. So, as um
Thomas mentioned as well with his
examples, he kind of he knew what to do.
He knew the decision, but didn't go with
it. So, a lot of understand intuition is
learn to listen to yourself and what it
feels like. There's a lot of times where

[1:03:00]
feels like. There's a lot of times where
there's kind of these two voices. Oh, I
should do this or should I do that? and
they can feel like they've directly
competed. But when the kind of emotion
subsides and you're back into reflecting
on it, you're like, "Actually, I knew
that was a fold. I knew that was a
call." So with this over time, you build
up a sample size and you realize you

[1:03:16]
up a sample size and you realize you
have a tendency. So re for you when
you're on a downswing, your tendency,
your fear tendency is to go, "Oh, let's
fall. Let's be more passive." So we can
see the voice of fear for you is leading
to a tendency of being more passive. For
somebody else, they might have a fear

[1:03:30]
somebody else, they might have a fear
that feels similar, but they be more
aggressive in those spots. Like, oh,
they make quick decisions. They don't
like getting pushed around. So, their
fear makes them act aggressively. So, I
think the kind of root is understand
your tendency, how this fear and
intuition interplay with you and spend
some time getting to know it. And as

[1:03:45]
some time getting to know it. And as
Thomas has mentioned there, it's very
hard to like to speak about, okay, how
do you learn to trust that intuitive
voice and not listen to that fear voice
as often because they are competing, but
over time you realize there's one voice
that is more likely going to be right,

[1:04:00]
that is more likely going to be right,
the intuition voice, but there's a high
risk of mistakes. I've got to trust it.
I'm going to make mistakes. Then there's
another voice going, don't do that.
Don't do that. And the fear voice is
always like a protective voice. And
protective voice always sounds
reasonable. It's like, oh yeah, I don't
want to risk it. this is this sounds

[1:04:15]
want to risk it. this is this sounds
dangerous. I'll just do the fear one. So
we end up like defaulting to the fear
voice very often. So we need to
understand ourselves and then we need to
be brave enough to override that. So to
go with our gut. So as Thomas mentioned
was perfect. He feels so much better
when he makes mistakes but he trust his

[1:04:32]
when he makes mistakes but he trust his
intuition. You live and die by your own
sword. So what that does is you
internalize I trust myself. I trust
myself to make mistakes. I will not be
perfect and I will I will make mistakes
and I'm okay with that. And once you
instill that and as you mentioned Renee
the fear is in the future once you

[1:04:46]
the fear is in the future once you
realize okay the fear is just an outcome
that I'm afraid of in the future when it
actually happens and you make a mistake
what's the fear there's a moment to deal
with get on with it so we sort of have
this kind of internal battle see I think
the if I could summarize it in terms of

[1:05:00]
the if I could summarize it in terms of
how to work on it understand how fear
gets you to act what is your personal
tendency and then learn to override that
this is a whole process to go through
but the main thing is understand you
have a tendency reneg and rivers is to
override that fear tendency. But there's
ways of practically approaching it to to

[1:05:16]
ways of practically approaching it to to
trust your intuition. And then it leads
to how do you deal with mistakes? So I'm
going to push this back to Thomas in
terms of how do you deal with mistakes
when it does come from trusting
yourself? Because this is where the mind
can really freak out because like you
idiot, you didn't think about it. Why
did you do that? Because you made an

[1:05:30]
did you do that? Because you made an
assumption in a spot and let's say it
was incorrect. So you've made a mistake.
How do you generally internalize or deal
with mistakes that you make? Yeah. Uh
first of all I must say all everything
you said I really agreed. I I thought it
was many great points or strategies or

[1:05:45]
was many great points or strategies or
techniques how to uh you know improve
yourself and that make me think about
just a couple things that I'm going to
mention before answering the question
that how do I deal with those mistakes.
Um but yeah something you mentioned I
just wanted to reinforce it is that uh

[1:06:00]
just wanted to reinforce it is that uh
Rene asked okay how do we do that? Uh
Adam you gave a few element of answer uh
and you mentioned it's also about
getting some reps in uh basically you
have to do the mistakes many times and
then you also have to do the right
choice many times and then eventually

[1:06:17]
choice many times and then eventually
you're going to develop a confidence and
in poker you really need confidence
because many decisions you can never
know if they were good. You can never
know if the guy was actually folding top
pair, but this time he had trips. Uh you
cannot know when you fold if the guy was

[1:06:31]
cannot know when you fold if the guy was
bluffing or not, right? And so it takes
a lot of reps to build that confidence.
And the more confidence you are, the
less validation you need and the more
like I don't care what he had there. I
know I I played that spot a 100 times. I
know he would have folded top pair often

[1:06:46]
know he would have folded top pair often
enough. I'm happy with my play. He had
two pair now. That's fine, you know. Um
so yeah, that was the first thing. But
was the second thing um yeah how do I
also choose to go more often with my

[1:07:00]
also choose to go more often with my
intuition nowadays than to listen to the
fears is because I understood that I'm
going to be a better poker player if I
listen to my intuition. That's my
conviction. Now I don't have scientific
evidence of that but that's what I
believe in. And what's the most fun in

[1:07:17]
believe in. And what's the most fun in
poker Rene and Adam in in tournament
poker? Like what's the most fun? making
an exploit and being right even more fun
than that
and ended up winning it. Yes, winning uh

[1:07:30]
and ended up winning it. Yes, winning uh
winning is the most fun. And so, how do
I get the most fun in this game? That's
by putting myself into as many times as
possible in a spot where I make money
and where I make a good decision. How do
I do that? It's by following intuition
and going by playing against the fears.

[1:07:47]
and going by playing against the fears.
It's by playing to win. Yes. Because I
feel like intuition, listening to your
intuition is playing to win. Whereas if
you try to like literally GTO strategies
are built around not losing, right? If
you think about this guys, if you try to

[1:08:00]
you think about this guys, if you try to
play GTO, you're you're playing from
fear. You're trying not to lose. But if
you trust your intuition, you're trying
to play to win. GTO strategy, the real
one is pretty savage. And I would argue
it plays to win. But yeah, it's easy to

[1:08:16]
it plays to win. But yeah, it's easy to
find something in the GTO strategy like
the RNG and stuff and be like, "Oh, I'm
going to be too passive." Um, so coming
back to your question, Adam, how do I
deal with the mistakes where I I

[1:08:30]
deal with the mistakes where I I
basically So I think your question is
the mistakes where you didn't think
about something, right? Or you didn't
have the information. Is that the type
of mistake or is it the mistake where
you knew what you had to do but you
didn't? not the fear-based mistakes, but
the intuition based mistakes because I

[1:08:45]
the intuition based mistakes because I
want to reinforce like you're you're
going to learn to trust yourself. So, I
want the audience to be taken out. Okay,
I'm going to learn to trust my
intuition. But with that, there's a
caveat. You're going to make mistakes
and you're going to be like, oh [ __ ] I
should have listened to the fear instead
of the intuition. So, how do you deal
with those? Hm. Well, um I'm not sure if

[1:09:02]
with those? Hm. Well, um I'm not sure if
I had to
work for that
uh so that those mistake would be less
painful, but naturally they just feel
much better. Like if I'm doing something
because I just didn't know uh that that

[1:09:17]
because I just didn't know uh that that
was the solution or
because yeah, my intuition thought that,
you know, I'm pretty sure he's bluffing
and he's gonna over bluffing and then he
end up not bluffing. I mean, maybe I'm

[1:09:31]
end up not bluffing. I mean, maybe I'm
still right. So, when I do those
mistakes, somehow it
doesn't feel too painful. I don't know.
Uh, the very painful one is the I know
it's a call, but I fold. And then maybe

[1:09:47]
it's a call, but I fold. And then maybe
I I see a review um a replay, maybe I
just bust an hour later, 13th. Uh, and
I'm like, man, I knew it was a call. I
shared a hand with three friends. I run
the hand myself. all the results going
in the same direction. It was a call and

[1:10:01]
in the same direction. It was a call and
this one is painful because I knew it
and I just let the fear, you
know, change the the the the outcome of
my tournament.
Yeah. It's almost like intuition's quite
raw. It's vulnerable. It's your best

[1:10:16]
raw. It's vulnerable. It's your best
efforts, your best assumptions in that
moment and you almost just go like this
is the best I got. It's kind of this
vulnerable situation I might be wrong.
You're right. Whereas fear is like oh
well wait a second. What what's GTO
going to do here? what can I fall back
on? Can I RNG this? And it it's

[1:10:30]
on? Can I RNG this? And it it's
protective. It's like not putting
yourself out there. And it's almost like
that. Yeah. That fear of making a
mistake, you therefore go for the
defensive approach. Whereas intuition is
going to be it's going to be more
vulnerable and more raw, but also it
feels more authentic. So even when you
fail, you're like, "Oh, I love that.

[1:10:45]
fail, you're like, "Oh, I love that.
That was the best I could do there." And
it does still hurt, but it's different.
It's a different kind of pain. And I can
100% relate to that. And I have many
conversations with clients on these
topics. And a lot one of the big pain
points from players is I knew I should
have did that but I didn't. And like it
drives them crazy because they're like
ah I just I just had this I had the read

[1:11:01]
ah I just I just had this I had the read
and I didn't do it. So yeah I think
we've done a really good job of kind of
unpacking why that is. Um yeah I don't
think we've ever spoken this depth on
this topic. So I'm glad this topic came
up. All right. I quickly want to circle
into dealing with big challenges. So
obviously we deal with mistakes. I want

[1:11:15]
obviously we deal with mistakes. I want
to touch on basically how you've dealt
with the biggest challenges of your
career. So, if we could jump into a a
big setback, maybe one of the biggest
challenges of your career and how you
were able to navigate that. Yeah. Okay.
I must say I love that analogy, that
intuition is your best effort. I thought

[1:11:30]
intuition is your best effort. I thought
it was uh remarkable. I love it. That
actually made me think at the gym, let's
say you walk 20 minutes to go to the
gym, you enter, you do three reps, and
then you go back home. You're going to
be like, man, I mean, I I could have
done more. Uh and then the other
scenario is that you do as much res as

[1:11:47]
scenario is that you do as much res as
much reps as you can until failure.
That's going to feel amazing. Although
you're gonna fail, right? You're going
to drop the weight everywhere. Uh the
whole gym is going to look at you.
You're going to come back with pain and
you're going to feel amazing.
Uh so biggest setback of my career?

[1:12:02]
Uh so biggest setback of my career?
Yeah. I mean, I had a couple.
Um
probably I would say I mean there's one
where I went into downswing when I was
playing S and goes and I was backed and

[1:12:17]
playing S and goes and I was backed and
for like a year and a half I was in a
big downswing didn't make profit. Uh
savings were melting. Not much money
left. Uh I was studying so much pre flop
and still not having so many good

[1:12:30]
and still not having so many good
results. I'm like like why am I working
so hard for this? Like is it really
worth it?
Um how I navigate those. Yeah, I mean
I'm not quite sure
um I mean that's more like very

[1:12:46]
um I mean that's more like very
technical again but I must say that
studying always helped me in those tough
moments. uh maybe with different people,
maybe hiring a different coach, but like
improving myself, growing, learning, and
feeling better about myself, increasing
my confidence, seeing, oh, there's an

[1:13:01]
my confidence, seeing, oh, there's an
edge here on the left and on the right
that I could take because I saw it in
the sim, you know, that has helped me
mentally to stay positive and confident
or at least, you know, often enough. Not
all the time, of course.
Um, I think eventually you must really

[1:13:15]
Um, I think eventually you must really
just love the game, right? Um I think in
general in life if you are born in a
western country if you have some kind of
you know freedom of choice I think we
should all do something that we love and
nothing else. Uh even if your goal is to

[1:13:32]
nothing else. Uh even if your goal is to
make the most money possible that's fine
but do it with doing something that you
love. Maybe it's building businesses
maybe it's consulting businesses maybe
it's startups maybe like you know tech
health whatever. So eventually I really

[1:13:47]
health whatever. So eventually I really
love the game. I think that's why I
stayed.
Um yeah,
man. I guess another thing and it's more
recent is focusing on self- growth. Uh
that wasn't the case maybe seven years

[1:14:00]
that wasn't the case maybe seven years
ago, but more recently I found a lot of
joy and just yeah feeling like
fulfillment in growing outside of the
table, right? Learning like listening to
a podcast makes me feel incredible. uh
listening to a book makes me feel
incredible. doing like a live kind of

[1:14:17]
incredible. doing like a live kind of
self-growth program makes me feel
incredible and so those
thing make my day a win you know when I
do them no matter what happens even if I
have a bad session if I have I don't
know many things if I started the first

[1:14:31]
know many things if I started the first
30 minutes of my day by learning
something I feel great and I'm just
happy so those I think help a lot in
navigating the tougher times I would say
yeah perfect let's uh take the
conversation towards personal growth and
how that can help during tough times s I

[1:14:45]
how that can help during tough times s I
do feel like it is really important to
understand like okay there's going to be
times in your poor career where you're
going through a hard time it's just
almost like you can't see the light at
the end of the tunnel and how we
navigate those is really important so
you did mention like learning was
important studying during that time then
you did say more recently personal

[1:15:00]
you did say more recently personal
growth is how you kind of feel good
about yourself during tough times so for
you what have been some of the most
powerful changes or realizations you've
made on your personal growth journey I
picture myself when I started going
deeper into this I started to realize oh
wow I didn't know this about the brain
oh wow this how psychology works. This

[1:15:16]
oh wow this how psychology works. This
is how my old patterns have been showing
up in my life. And it just like light
bulbs just going off everywhere. And I
was like, "Wow, the way I've been
showing up has been very blindsided."
And I started to my eyes a bit. So for
you, what have been some of the the big
personal growth chapters you can
remember? Hm. Well, I think um enjoying

[1:15:34]
remember? Hm. Well, I think um enjoying
some things in life outside of the table
that has been some kind of like if when
you're deep in the hole and everything
and maybe you spend your time grinding
and blah blah blah and it feels like
your whole life is poker. And if poker
doesn't go well, well, your whole life

[1:15:45]
doesn't go well, well, your whole life
is not going well. Um, but if instead
you have a healthy relationship with a
partner, you have one or two really good
friends that you have the discipline to
call every Saturday morning to have a
good conversation or or have a brunch
with. Uh, if you enjoy nature and you

[1:16:02]
with. Uh, if you enjoy nature and you
force yourself to go in nature four
times a week. Um, it can be anything.
Can be sports, can be, you know,
whatever. Uh, I feel like having those
things outside of poker that are

[1:16:15]
things outside of poker that are
successful by nature because they make
they make you happy, then at least if
poker doesn't go well, it's only, you
know, maybe 70% of your life or 60 or 50
or 80, but you still have something
that's going well that makes you happy.
Uh, and I think some years in my earlier

[1:16:31]
Uh, and I think some years in my earlier
days, I didn't have that so much. And so
when I went through that big downswing,
the first one I'm mentioning when I was
playing sitting goes, that was really
hard. I almost quit poker. I remember I
was going to Vegas. I told my dad if I
don't win in Vegas here, honestly, I'm
considering quitting. It's been a year

[1:16:46]
considering quitting. It's been a year
and a half. I'm not I'm not winning.
Like, it's just so tough. Um, obviously
I binged because I'm a luck box. Uh, and
it went better. But, um, but then more
recently through the challenges then I
had a more balanced life, right? I'm

[1:17:00]
had a more balanced life, right? I'm
still very intense in poker, very
competitive and everything, but you
know, I have couple friends, I have a
fantastic relationship, I love nature,
I'm going out, I'm doing some sports.
And so eventually the life and I and I'm
doing some self growth like I mentioned.
And so the life feels like there's a lot

[1:17:15]
And so the life feels like there's a lot
of things going forward, positive, some
kind of small victories here and there.
And so if poker doesn't go well, well,
it's it's not the end of my life
basically. It's, you know, it's not the
only thing that matters. Yeah, I think
that's so important that poker isn't
everything. It's a piece of your life,

[1:17:30]
everything. It's a piece of your life,
but it's not your whole life. And I can
relate to players who struggle the most
are often the ones who are kind of the
most ambitious. They want to get the
finish line the quickest, but poker is
everything. And then when they're
losing, like this really struggle to
think that their life isn't falling
apart because poker is their life. So I

[1:17:45]
apart because poker is their life. So I
think it's really important to have that
kind of balance of other things you're
pursuing, whether that's health goals,
fitness goals, learning things outside
of poker, having friends and family who
you can connect with, so your life feels
more balanced, that you're not all in on
poker. You are all in a poker, but
you're not the only thing. So when

[1:18:00]
you're not the only thing. So when
things aren't bad, you've got other
things to fall back on. For me, it was
always the gym, fitness, and yeah,
personal development as well was things
I was always pursuing outside of poker,
which helped me feel like during down
down swings, I was still progressing in
certain areas and still still a human
that was had some value in the world
rather than just a loser. You can win

[1:18:17]
rather than just a loser. You can win
the game. So I want I want to take this
conversation into the power of the mind.
I know you've done some interesting
tweets on these topics and we had
listened to podcast of you speaking on
this as well. And you mentioned
something powerful in terms of we are
just programs that run in the
background. And you also touched on

[1:18:31]
background. And you also touched on
creating your own character and I so
resonate with this I think a lot about
identity and the person we're showing up
as and how malleable that is but most
people don't take conscious control of
that process. So for you when it comes
to the programs in the background and

[1:18:45]
to the programs in the background and
creating your character, how have you
approached that for yourself? I think
the word the most important word I think
you said is conscious where when you
gain the consciousness that you can
define who you are how you act how you

[1:19:01]
define who you are how you act how you
interact with people how you deal with
challenges you can actually decide you
can write on paper how you want to be
ideally and it's not going to be by
tomorrow morning but if you do a few
practices here and there 6 months 12

[1:19:15]
practices here and there 6 months 12
months 2 years 5 years I don't know but
it's only a decision eventually. So you
can't really become this zen happy
intuition guided beast like it's really
just a decision. And so when I gained
consciousness of that, I was like, okay,

[1:19:31]
consciousness of that, I was like, okay,
that's the game changer, right? That's
that's I can really decide everything in
my life. If I want to be a billionaire,
that's just a decision. It might take me
40 years, but it's just a decision
eventually, right? So yeah, that was
that was that consciousness of just

[1:19:45]
that was that consciousness of just
choosing what kind of life I want to
live. And more recently, I think I'm
deviating from a question. I don't even
remember your question but uh more
recently I discovered that that is also
uh true in the emotional life in the
relationships uh in the intellectual

[1:20:01]
relationships uh in the intellectual
life in in so many things you just have
to decide what kind of life you want to
live and then implementing strategies
one after another whether they are super
small steps three minutes in the morning
journaling you know like really small

[1:20:16]
journaling you know like really small
stuff setting intentions before you go
to a room with somebody small things uh
but eventually you can decide everything
and you you can have the perfect super
happy life, super mindset uh that that
you want to have. Yes, 100% agree with

[1:20:30]
you want to have. Yes, 100% agree with
this that it's so powerful when you
realize this is true. And you can debate
whether it's true or not, but it's in my
opinion it's it gets hard to debate when
you actually start to live it. And the
way I like to think about it is you've
got a version of you now who's shown up.
So all your character traits, your
identity, and we've come very attached

[1:20:45]
identity, and we've come very attached
to it. We come very fixed with that
identity. This is me. This is what I'm
good at. This is what I'm not good at.
And then when we let's say what you did,
you wrote down a list of who I want to
be. I want to be a billionaire. I want
to be a great poker player. It doesn't
feel like us. There's a disconnect
between all these things we want to be
and who we currently are. So we need to
learn to bridge that gap, but also start

[1:21:01]
learn to bridge that gap, but also start
showing up as that new version as soon
as possible. And I think it comes down
as well as you talking about intuition
like confidence. We need confidence that
we can make changes that we can become a
different version of ourel. And for some
people people who struggle who like very
fixed identity, haven't made many

[1:21:15]
fixed identity, haven't made many
changes, they lack that confidence in
themselves. they go, I'm going to get in
great shape and then they skip the first
gym session or I'm gonna I'm gonna lose
weight and they binge eat that night and
they they haven't got a confidence in
themselves. So, I think what you touched
on there was importance that kind of
small steps like what could I do now to

[1:21:31]
small steps like what could I do now to
step closer towards that. So, you've
almost got this is me the current
version. This is who I want to be and
these are all the steps in between.
There might be a thousand steps to get
to that version of me, but these are
some of the action items I can take. and
then getting very practical going all
right that version of me what can I do

[1:21:45]
right that version of me what can I do
today to take one more step closer and
then over time you sort of build
repetition exactly one step and
everything's just one step like what
else can you take you can't take two
steps you can only take one then the
second one so don't jump too many steps
ahead and I think that is where people
often get lost in this they almost have

[1:22:00]
often get lost in this they almost have
the ideal version and then who they are
actually I want to touch on this with
you because I've experienced some
conflict here as well when I've tried to
make too much growth too quickly I've
almost been like right I've got my pen
and paper I know who I want to Hey,
let's let's go to work. And then I felt
this disconnect of God, I'm so far from

[1:22:16]
this disconnect of God, I'm so far from
this. This is like this is miles away.
And then I feel the pull of my old
tendencies just going just do what
you've always done out of this. Don't
don't worry about that. That's another
thing. So for you, how have you have you
experienced that yourself or how have
you overcame those gaps in where you are
now and where you want to be? Yeah, I

[1:22:31]
now and where you want to be? Yeah, I
think it's very natural. Change is one
of the big threat in for the human mind
like from a survival point of view. And
so I think change is hard for most
people for 99% of the people I'm one of
them. Um and and so when I see for

[1:22:48]
them. Um and and so when I see for
example I can improve a lot in maybe
relationship uh I I see what kind of
ideal relationship should I would like
to have or and what kind of partner I
would like to be. This is the ideal

[1:23:00]
would like to be. This is the ideal
version. I'm there. I'm over there like
the back of the room. Okay. Okay. That's
scary. Like that really scary. I have to
change so much. Like that's even like um
not even scary. It's like uh my ego
takes a bit of a hit. I'm like way I'm

[1:23:15]
takes a bit of a hit. I'm like way I'm
so far from my ideal. Um but like you
mentioned eventually not any not
everything needs to happen at once and
just gaining consciousness of that.
Maybe the next day I'm going to feel
better and we're gonna Hey, that's a

[1:23:30]
better and we're gonna Hey, that's a
good first step. Gaining the
consciousness. Now, if I just take one
small step every Saturday when I have
time and I dedicate one hour to that,
you know, in 52 sessions, I'm going to
be, you know, 52 steps. That's a lot of

[1:23:45]
be, you know, 52 steps. That's a lot of
one hour. So, it make me think of a
quote that says, be patient with your
big goals and impatience with small
actions. And so, if you have a big goal
like that, it takes patience. It's going
to take years maybe to get to your

[1:24:00]
to take years maybe to get to your
ideal. Maybe never because you can maybe
always improve but being patient with
the small action you can do like you
mentioned just put one feet in the gym
everything else is bonus you stay there
10 minutes that's fine this your first
session doesn't matter just talk to the
receptionist but like small small steps

[1:24:16]
receptionist but like small small steps
right and then uh yeah little by little
the small steps add up and that make me
think of a great book which is atomic
habits and where they really talk about
everything is just eventually a habit
like every big change comes from a habit

[1:24:30]
like every big change comes from a habit
Right? Nothing, nobody created something
huge at once in one day uh in one
session. It always takes perseverance
basically just habits and routines and
nothing else. Yeah, 100% agree with
that. And topic habits the book on

[1:24:45]
that. And topic habits the book on
habits like you've got to read that if
you want to make lasting changes in a
practical way. I really love how he
breaks everything down into practical
ways of taking action. I think you
mentioned like change is hard. I think
it's it's good to touch on that because
we always we all feel resistance. We
want to change. It's almost like there's

[1:25:00]
want to change. It's almost like there's
a version of us that that's got used to
doing stuff and we want to break free
from that. There's a resistance to that
and we've got to break free from that
resistance. Even it's like a simple
thing like changing your morning routine
or do an extra study session. It takes a
bit of almost like almost like lift off
power like a rocket like taking off. It

[1:25:16]
power like a rocket like taking off. It
takes like a lot of energy to get the
the rocket off the ground. It's the same
with a habit of changing something. You
got to put a lot of intentionality and
effort into making that change. And also
as you were speaking it reminded me of
the book awareness by Anthony Dlo and
he's he always says like people don't
want to change. People want their toys.

[1:25:30]
want to change. People want their toys.
They want their comforts. They don't
want to change. No one wants to wake up
because waking up and changing it's
hard. You've got to almost like
acknowledge your shortcomings and go I'm
not quite good. So you mentioned
relationships. That's a hard one to
confront because you're going [ __ ] I've
been sucking in relationships for how
long? And now you feel like this like

[1:25:45]
long? And now you feel like this like
almost like threatens and now you've got
to acknowledge that before you can take
that next step forwards. So I think that
with alongside this there's an element
of accepting where you're currently at
as you take that next step. So I feel
like some of my mistakes in personal
growth were where I was trying to make
changes to cover over lack. I didn't

[1:26:01]
changes to cover over lack. I didn't
feel good. So I'd want to move to that
next goal to to overcome that when in
reality when I've got better at it. It's
almost like okay accept where I'm at
now. This is where you're currently at
with your current level of awareness and
consciousness. Okay cool. How can I take
that next step and enjoy the path that

[1:26:15]
that next step and enjoy the path that
I'm taking rather than trying to rush to
a finish line. I feel like a lot of
personal growth if we look at it in the
wrong way, we can be trying to get
somewhere instead of enjoying the
journey of getting better and making
progress. I think that's a piece
together well and I do like the small
actions because it comes down to at some

[1:26:30]
actions because it comes down to at some
point we can think, we can journal, we
can reflect, we can meditate, but at
some point what actions are you going to
take that's going to move you forward?
And then just a final thing on this one,
just acknowledge that you're not going
to be perfect. So like you set goals,
you set changes, there's an element of
change which is messy where you're going

[1:26:45]
change which is messy where you're going
to go back to your old patterns somewhat
frequently and it's going to feel like I
failed. And I think a some people really
struggle with this. I I personally don't
because I was like you fell over, get
back up. You fell over, get back up. But
some like I fell over again. I didn't do
what what I said I was going to do. I'm
a loser. I suck. I can't make changes.

[1:27:00]
a loser. I suck. I can't make changes.
Adam and Thomas told me to make changes
and here I go again. Doesn't work for
me. I I always suck. This is me again.
So I think not getting caught up in
those narratives and realizing like you
can always go again and just I know it's
challenging for people who struggle with
this to override that but just realizing
look it's over time you could build
momentum you'll build confidence in

[1:27:16]
momentum you'll build confidence in
yourself find a change that you can make
and then just build that change into
your life with a repetition till that
becomes your kind of sample size ah I
made that one change I got up it's 30
minutes earlier cool that's your win
then from there you can build build more
so I just want to touch on that just for

[1:27:30]
so I just want to touch on that just for
some people might struggle with the the
initial changes that they want want to
make I'm curious for sure
I'm I'm curious going to ask both of you
guys because obviously we're all we're
all interested right in trying to be the
best version we can be. We're all
striving towards becoming better. Do you

[1:27:45]
striving towards becoming better. Do you
guys ever feel like or do you have
phases phases where it can feel very
overwhelming as well? Like I some I have
moments where it can be very motivating
if I learn about for example these
things that you said oh I I realized I
showed up as a partner in the wrong way.

[1:28:00]
showed up as a partner in the wrong way.
On one side I'm like cool I now know
what to do. But sometimes on the other
side it's like okay let's say for
example we have this podcast you're a
poker player you have to be better in my
case I have a daughter I try to be the
best dad I can be I have to be a better
partner does it sometimes feel

[1:28:16]
partner does it sometimes feel
overwhelming like I said when I feel
good about myself and have energy it can
feel very motivating but sometimes it
can also feel very overwhelming I don't
know if you guys ever experienced that
uh maybe some of our audience can relate
you have any any tips in this regards I

[1:28:30]
you have any any tips in this regards I
can say I've 100% experienced
Um, and I would say it's related. Yeah,
levels of energy I think are a really
big deal. Uh, take three days off, spend
them in bed sleeping, and then the
fourth days, the fourth day you first in

[1:28:46]
fourth days, the fourth day you first in
the morning fresh, tackle those topics,
and you're going to feel like Superman.
You're going to feel like, oh my god, I
want to take so many steps today. Right?
But then do that uh at 2 am after 12
hours of work and coaching and podcast

[1:29:00]
hours of work and coaching and podcast
and you're like so exhausted that your
mind is like, "Oh my god, that is
terrible. I really don't want to do
that." Um yeah, I can relate to that for
sure. Yeah, me too. And I feel like we
all have that kind of struggle of trying
to make changes but then not trying to
overwhelm myself. We live in a world of

[1:29:17]
overwhelm myself. We live in a world of
just crazy information, crazy amount of
exciting stuff, but also it can feel
very overwhelming. I just need to do all
this stuff. I need to read this book,
listen to this podcast, and work on 30
different areas of my life. Oh my god,
this is going to be hard. See, I think
always like simplifying like bring it

[1:29:30]
always like simplifying like bring it
back to what step can I take? Every time
I feel overwhelmed, it's always I'm
trying to do too much, things are too
complicated. Just bring it back to
basics. And also like sometimes what I
do now is learn to just accept where I'm
at. And I think this is a a big part of
it because the overwhelm comes from you

[1:29:46]
it because the overwhelm comes from you
wanting to be in the future. You wanted
to be in the end result of making the
changes. What's wrong with now? Now it's
good. Okay, maybe you're not as good as
relationships as you want to be. Maybe
your pocket career sucks right now
because your results are bad. Cool.
Accept that. Be where you're at a bit
more present. And I feel like from
there, you can always take the next

[1:30:00]
there, you can always take the next
step. So, if you simplify to accept the
moment that you're in, then what's the
next step I need to take? And then watch
the mind go, yeah, but that's not going
to do it because you need these other 50
steps and oh, okay, nice one, mind.
Watch that. Observe the mind. Do all
that. Where are you now? Back to the
current moment. And as Thomas was
saying, like meditation in these small
moments, getting back in tune with the

[1:30:15]
moments, getting back in tune with the
body, being more present, that really
helps because the mind will think about
the future a lot. will feel overwhelming
at times and just bring it back to this
current moment and when we think about
life what have we got the moment we're
in to take an action and that's it and
some is a good action some is a bad one

[1:30:30]
some is a good action some is a bad one
and don't let the the mind create a
narrative there yeah and empathy as well
right towards you know towards yourself
and the fact that you you know you
cannot do it all like you said so
there's one like strategical side right
to kind of chunk it down and don't make
it too hard for yourself basically to

[1:30:46]
it too hard for yourself basically to
succeed which is very demotivating and
and and very overwhelming I thought the
point that Thomas made was very good as
well because if you feel energetic,
right? So it comes back to like your
basic habits, right? If you if you sleep
properly, if you eat properly, if you
exercise properly, you feel better, you

[1:31:01]
exercise properly, you feel better, you
have more energy and therefore things
feel easier, right? And then like in the
same time also being okay with, you
know, like, oh, I sucked at this or oh,
I'm I'm here now. uh because sometimes
it can feel like if you if you're only
looking at there and then you reflect on

[1:31:15]
looking at there and then you reflect on
yourself right now and you only look at
all the ideal versions it's like I
actually I suck pretty bad right but
it's like to to if that narrative due to
low energy I think that's usually then
the cause if your energy then is low
then that narrative can become start to

[1:31:31]
then that narrative can become start to
live its own voice right and then you
can really kind of talk yourself down or
at least I've had phases where I
definitely experienced that where I was
just so focused on everything that I'm
doing wrong everything that I should
optimize combined with low energy and

[1:31:46]
optimize combined with low energy and
then feeling overwhelmed due to having a
poor strategy doing doing too much
things in the same time and then you're
left kind of feeling like oh I'm
actually sort of a loser if you
understand what I mean but I think you
guys both uh use the word narrative and

[1:32:00]
guys both uh use the word narrative and
self talk and I think it's a really
important topic and again I think that
there uh like many areas there are just
tools that we can learn we can just
basically get coached in a way we can
get better like we can get better at

[1:32:15]
get better like we can get better at
anything and we can get better at selft
talk and narratives as well and you know
having those negative self-t talk dogs I
think that happens to a lot of people
nowadays
um it's extremely limiting both on the

[1:32:31]
um it's extremely limiting both on the
short and the long run and at the same
time there are many tools that are
accessible to anyone who wants to hear
about them um to start to work on that,
right? And you can learn a couple tools

[1:32:46]
right? And you can learn a couple tools
and then you just little bit have to
discipline uh yourself to use those
tools, right? If you c if you catch
yourself thinking something negative
about yourself, if you catch it, then
the next step is discipline. Is that do

[1:33:02]
the next step is discipline. Is that do
you want to keep doing it because that's
a comfort zone? Because you want to feel
pity by yourself? You want somebody to
pity you? There's so many reasons we can
keep doing it, but once you caught it,
like it's a choice. And sometimes it's

[1:33:16]
like it's a choice. And sometimes it's
hard to say, "Hey, never say that any
ever again." It's like it feels
uncomfortable. Uh you can do anything.
Even if it takes time, even if it takes
reps, even if you know it's going to be
hard, you can do anything. It's just

[1:33:30]
hard, you can do anything. It's just
about small steps like Adam told me. uh
it's just about self- love blah like and
then honestly just using those tools in
um making yourself look better I feel
like you can resolve a lot of these you
know um yeah limitations basically and

[1:33:47]
know um yeah limitations basically and
you can end up accepting that okay I
don't have to be perfect but eventually
I can do anything I want and that's a
good selft talk compared to I'm a loser
that's should you can never tell that to
yourself that can never exist in your

[1:34:01]
yourself that can never exist in your
mind and if it does and you catch it,
that's okay. Accept it, you know,
apologize to yourself. Uh you don't have
to hold grudge or anything. Tell
yourself you love you, but tell
yourself, "Hey, bro, that's not true."
Even if it takes discipline, even if you

[1:34:15]
Even if it takes discipline, even if you
feel silly to say it in a mirror, I do
believe it's really important.
Yeah, I I want to touch more on this as
well. So, it feels like it starts with
awareness to spots the kind of thought
patterns that we're having. Then it
comes acceptance which I 100% agree with
which I think is the harder part which

[1:34:30]
which I think is the harder part which
we'll touch on and then change from
there. Do you want to change? Can you
change? Are you willing to confront
change? So for you let's talk about how
you've been able to accept some of the
narratives that you've seen in your mind
and then some of the tools you've
practically used to change those. So as
you mentioned some people are very

[1:34:46]
you mentioned some people are very
identified with the narrative. So if the
voice in their head says I'm a loser
like they don't question that voice.
They've heard it they're conscious of
it. They've they've been aware of it,
but they don't they don't necessarily
they accept everything it says is what
I'm getting at. But I I want to get to
the point of how do you observe what the

[1:35:01]
the point of how do you observe what the
mind is saying, accept it, what it's
doing, but not accept what the context
of it, if that makes sense. So for you,
what are some tools that you've used to
navigate that? Huh. makes me think of a
great book that I read that's called uh
the card of the extraordinary mind um by

[1:35:18]
the card of the extraordinary mind um by
uh Vish Lakani who's owner of a great
platform mine valley and yeah he
basically he's also a engineer who got
into that world and so he also

[1:35:30]
into that world and so he also
deconstructed everything in terms of
algorithm and programs running and it's
a very for for rational people you guys
are going to like it because uh yeah
it's It's like a rational approach to
the the mental and the the mental health

[1:35:45]
the the mental and the the mental health
and selft talk and that kind of thing.
Um and so yeah I really basically
learned when I was reading that book
that you can question your beliefs. So
there's a topic for example what's my
worth in this world? what am I capable
of or what kind of relationship do I

[1:36:01]
of or what kind of relationship do I
deserve or like those topics that we
don't consciously think about you you
rarely wonder hey uh what kind of
relationship is ideal for me like who
who asked that to themselves like it's
really rare but if you have those kind
of books or these tools and then it

[1:36:17]
of books or these tools and then it
tells you hey take the time to do that
okay then you do it and you actually ask
a question you're like huh wow what a
crazy question I have so many answers uh
then maybe he asks you to question the
beliefs that you
Why do you think that for example what

[1:36:31]
Why do you think that for example what
you are capable of in this world is this
or how rich can you become is this much?
Why do you believe that? Where does it
come from? Is it really really
really you knowing yourself or does it
come from maybe parents talking one way

[1:36:47]
come from maybe parents talking one way
you know maybe teachers maybe friends
making fun of you? Maybe I don't know
there's so many reasons that you we can
take in beliefs that are not ours that
we didn't create ourel right and when
you question those beliefs you're like
wait that's not ideal what would be an

[1:37:01]
wait that's not ideal what would be an
ideal belief an ideal belief would be
you know yeah I'm self learner and I
have the energy and the mindset to do
pretty much whatever I want if I put my
mind to it that's a great belief and

[1:37:16]
mind to it that's a great belief and
then you just change it you replace you
update the program right you do an
update Um and so little by little you
end up with those tools to just question
beliefs, question mindset and direct a
little bit your selft talk to better
directions.

[1:37:30]
directions.
Amazing. Yeah, I love I love all of
those steps. I feel like that's the
that's the practical hands-on way to do
it. You got to get this the beliefs the
surface, understand what beliefs you
currently have. You got to question them
what's true. You don't need necessarily
know where they came from, although you
can do some exploring. And then you got

[1:37:46]
can do some exploring. And then you got
to upgrade them. Like change those
beliefs to something that's helps your
life more going forward. I think this
really pieces together like the changes
we've been talking about of creating new
character. Because a lot of changes come
from like breaking down old beliefs,
creating new ones to allow yourself to
make those day-to-day changes because if

[1:38:00]
make those day-to-day changes because if
we if we have all all these beliefs that
say I'm an idiot, I'm a loser. And then
we're writing down all the things we
want to do and changes. We hate conflict
because our belief systems are like I'm
the advers. So once we start breaking
down those beliefs alongside the change
we want to make over time, we just see
we just weaken those beliefs. The way I

[1:38:15]
we just weaken those beliefs. The way I
look at it, it's almost like your belief
is really strong. So it gets questioned.
It's almost like the bullies like puffed
his chest up and you start questioning.
He's like, "Oh, I get weaker." It gets
lighter and lighter and then your new
beliefs like the weak one and over time
you sort of strengthen those new
beliefs. So they start to feel like you
and it faces like this weird gap where
you're like the old beliefs don't feel

[1:38:30]
you're like the old beliefs don't feel
like me but the new ones still don't
either. Neither's quite in this kind of
messy middle I call it. But then over
time that new beliefs start to feel like
you. It's like yeah I do feel like a
high performer. I am showing up in this
way. Yeah, this is this is the new me.
So yeah really I love that kind of
practical way of piecing together
change. I think this is yeah really

[1:38:45]
change. I think this is yeah really
really important topic. So with this
like as we're making changes I want to
touch on the topic of peak performance
and I know you've got some ideas on this
and I think you mentioned you class
poker players as cognitive athletes
which is really interesting because I
call poker athletes very similar. How do
you see poker as a high performance

[1:39:00]
you see poker as a high performance
discipline and what some of the things
you feel are important for high
performance? H well clearly we are only
using our mind basically to perform in
this game and we were talking about
intuition making the difference between
fears um maybe paying attention to tells

[1:39:18]
fears um maybe paying attention to tells
when it's important uh there's so many
information we and we can gather and
then there's all the notes on everybody
every single showdown every single
sizing every single action is
potentially note that you can use later

[1:39:32]
potentially note that you can use later
um so I found that the better I can use
my brain, the better I perform in poker.
So, scenario one, I eat a huge bowl of
pasta with a lot of sugary sauce in

[1:39:47]
pasta with a lot of sugary sauce in
dinner break. I come back and I had a
bad night before because I drank six
glasses of wine, so I didn't sleep well.
Uh, that day I feel like rubbish. I'm
like low energy, don't have excitement.
After dinner break, I'm sleepy. I'm on

[1:40:01]
After dinner break, I'm sleepy. I'm on
my phone, right? like how can I ever
perform at my peak? Like is it my best
self? Am I showing up as my best self?
Like there's no way. And maybe that day
might not matter that much. Who knows?
But like if I'm going to play for 10

[1:40:17]
But like if I'm going to play for 10
years, one game where there's so much
money involved, do I honestly think that
showing up as my worst self between
showing up to my best self, do I really
think it's not going to make a
difference in terms of money? Of course

[1:40:30]
difference in terms of money? Of course
not. Like of course there's going to be
a few moments key moments where you're
gonna make a slightly better decision.
It's gonna worth be worth a lot of
money. Um maybe you're going to have a
little bit more endurance. Instead of
having a six-year car care carrier,
maybe it's 10 because you have higher
energy. Instead of having an eight hour

[1:40:46]
energy. Instead of having an eight hour
online session, maybe it's nine or 10.
And again, you do that for 10 years.
Everything add up, right? It's compound
interest, compound everything. Um so
that's just the money and performance
aspect. And for me, that was enough. I
was like, "All right, I'm sold." Uh, if

[1:41:01]
was like, "All right, I'm sold." Uh, if
I can focus better for longer time, uh,
play more tournaments over the summer
because I don't need the seven days uh,
you know, off in a row mid series
because I burn out. If I if I can
accumulate those small edges, I'm sold.

[1:41:15]
accumulate those small edges, I'm sold.
I'm making more money, more deep runs,
I'm happy. But there was a sneaky side
effect is that I started feeling better
and I started to be more happy and more
content with my journey because now it's
not only I'm going to grind 10 hours

[1:41:30]
not only I'm going to grind 10 hours
today. It's I'm going to the gym. I have
good hormones. Uh my body is getting
better. I'm able to climb better because
I'm stronger. Um then I meditate. So I
feel maybe less tired and more centered.
So less like chattering busy mind that

[1:41:46]
So less like chattering busy mind that
is kind of unpleasant and more like
happy place you know there's a little
bit of self growth like I end up showing
up as my best self and I end up being
more happy and so that was like a side
effect that was wow that's actually that

[1:42:00]
effect that was wow that's actually that
has become the main reason why I do it
right and then there's the third kind of
side effect which is long longevity
um it's kind of like it's proven that
many things can improve our longevity
and so I'm quite excited thinking that I

[1:42:15]
and so I'm quite excited thinking that I
might live 200 years and that when I'm
going to be 80 I'm going to look like a
45 50 years old in good shape now today
right so there's so many things that
kind of got me into that almost

[1:42:32]
kind of got me into that almost
addiction to leave it showing up as my
best self or like at least
improving.1% every day right
yeah I love all that And I think as you
mentioned there as well, it's almost

[1:42:45]
mentioned there as well, it's almost
like the brain and body are one. Like we
can try and separate them as I'm a poker
player. I only think with my mind like
you're living in a body and the whole
body is a energy system that's
interacting. And once we start to
understand that we're like, okay, well,
what does the body need to perform at a
high level? And I I really love it
because I think the way you went through

[1:43:00]
because I think the way you went through
that process, I think most poker players
will relate to the performance motive
goals first. They go, I want to perform
well. What do I need to do? It's much
easier to motivate a poker player to
change if they're going to get better
focus, better win rates than it is for
longevity or even to look good. Maybe
some guys will will be like, "Yes, I

[1:43:15]
some guys will will be like, "Yes, I
want to have the six-ack." But most
players like, I want to perform well.
And I think a lot of players for a long
time neglected the body. So like, oh
yeah, I feel like [ __ ] I do all these
long sessions. I have energy drinks and
and they crash after, but I'm doing well
at poker. And it's almost like a my
health sucks, but poker is going well.
And I obviously you can have success

[1:43:31]
And I obviously you can have success
like with an unhealthy lifestyle, but
over time you start to realize like
you're almost like pushing upstream.
you're going against the currents
because you're waiting against your body
and you're making yourself do stuff over
and over and very often you'll have a
short career, you'll burn out quicker
and you won't perform as well as you
could have if you prioritize health and

[1:43:46]
could have if you prioritize health and
performance. And then it makes me think
about, okay, well, what really matters?
And it's almost like for performance as
a poker player, it's almost like you
need to be a generalist. It's like
generalist and specialist. Like you
don't need to be an athlete with a
six-pack and the muscles, but you need
to be a generalist of the body. like you
need to understand exercise, nutrition,

[1:44:00]
need to understand exercise, nutrition,
you need to understand the basics of how
to fuel the energy system of the body.
So like compete and do high level poker,
you don't necessarily need to uh do the
marathons or uh be in the gym for an
hour every day because that doesn't
necessarily that's too specialist too
specialist for what you need. But

[1:44:15]
specialist for what you need. But
there's general principles and
categoristics of exercise and
performance that will 100% improve your
performance. And then as you mentioned,
you end up getting to the the end point
where you feel better. And that's just
like everyone wants to feel good,
everyone wants to be happy. that's like
kind of the the end point for for
everyone to some degree. And when you

[1:44:30]
everyone to some degree. And when you
realize, okay, I can actually these
don't need to compete with each other
because I think most poker players who
struggle with health and performance,
they kind of make poker compete with
health. Like, oh, I haven't got time. I
haven't got time to eat healthy. I
haven't got time to go to the gym. It's
like, okay, so now you've you've had

[1:44:45]
like, okay, so now you've you've had
them separate categories where I either
be healthy and feel good or I do well in
poker and now it's like which one do I
choose? I'll do well in poker. I'll do
the health stuff later. And I think that
the way you've described it, they at
some point they start to overlap and
then they become the same thing. in
feeling good, performing good, being my
best version, it's one thing. So I feel

[1:45:00]
best version, it's one thing. So I feel
the same way. I don't I don't think
about performance and then health is
separate. It's like it's the same thing.
If I want to be my best self, I got to
look after myself. There's no way I can
perform at a high level in anything I do
if I'm not looking after myself. So then
then they become intertwined and now it
becomes easy because now like okay, well
I want to perform well and be the best

[1:45:16]
I want to perform well and be the best
version. What should I do? So they had
to bring it practically for you. What
are some of the things that you do on a
day-to-day basis? What are some of the
performance things that you find very
important? and maybe walk us through a
day in the life if you're at the World
Series or go for a W cook prep. That's
that feels good for you. Yeah. Uh by the

[1:45:32]
that feels good for you. Yeah. Uh by the
way, I want to add one last thing to
what you were saying uh is that I think
we are really good at thinking short
term but really bad at thinking long
term.
And there might be a week or a month or

[1:45:45]
And there might be a week or a month or
six months in in your pocket career
where you know spending a little bit
less time on your fitness and and health
and everything might make you you know
one more K or or or 3K or whatever like
a a.1% more EV somehow and that might be

[1:46:02]
a a.1% more EV somehow and that might be
possible but what we are not good at is
thinking what if I play like for 5 years
and 10 years um what are the consequence
quences of not feeling so happy or not
so energetic or you know we don't know

[1:46:17]
so energetic or you know we don't know
it's just too big to for us to
comprehend the consequences. Um it's a
little bit like playing let's say your
maximum focus is 12 tables and you play
13 14 tables every day because you want

[1:46:31]
13 14 tables every day because you want
to maximize the EV, right? But there's
so many other ways to look at that. For
example, what if you play 11 tables and
you win a little bit less EV that day,
but you are more present, you think
more, you learn more, you become a

[1:46:46]
more, you learn more, you become a
better player faster for the next day
and then for the next day and then for
the next day and you do that for five
years. Who do you think is the best
pocket player after five years? The guy
who played 14 tables because and like uh
like two tables over his cap or the guy

[1:47:00]
like two tables over his cap or the guy
who played one table lower just so he
could think every decision and learn,
right? And so maybe the 14 tables guy is
going to start making a little bit more
EV in the beginning, but it's going to
be a straight line, super linear. And
the guy who plays less table is going to
be a little bit less E in the beginning,

[1:47:15]
be a little bit less E in the beginning,
but it's going to be exponential because
it's going to end up playing high
stakes, tritons, whatever, right? And
it's been the same with health. It's
really hard to imagine the consequences
of not having good health and a good
sleep and a good nutrition, everything
on the long run. We don't know what it

[1:47:31]
on the long run. We don't know what it
could cost us. But what is sure is that
right now it's not going to cost a lot.
You know, it might cost you $5 per day,
$40 per day, I don't know, to maximize
your health, but long term the
consequences can be like

[1:47:47]
consequences can be like
gigantic. Um, right. So, a day in my
life, let's say for me, the most
important routines, they're going to be
okay. Nutrition is something I really
care about. um especially when I play.

[1:48:03]
care about. um especially when I play.
So I think we all have different you
know metabolism and things work for some
and not for others. For me I pay a lot
of attention to not intake any sugar,
artificial sugar. Um basically have a

[1:48:17]
artificial sugar. Um basically have a
really low carb diet, you know, high
nutrients, high in veggies, high in good
oils and nuts and stuff. um lots of
energy, lots of good nutrients, but not
a lot of carbs and sugars that, you
know, impact my insulin and and I go on

[1:48:31]
know, impact my insulin and and I go on
a roller coaster and I'm tired and
excited and tired and excited. Um, so
that's one thing I pay attention to. But
then I would say sport is probably
probably the biggest. Uh, I feel like

[1:48:46]
probably the biggest. Uh, I feel like
every time I have a good gym session, I
have a high energy for the rest of the
day. It's like
95% efficiency. Um, this time in Vegas
last summer, I had a personal coach and

[1:49:01]
last summer, I had a personal coach and
I pushed myself more at the gym than any
other other years. And across the seven
weeks, I had a really long summer
because I played so many days, 13 hours
a day, busting at the bubble, uh, many
times in a row. Like, it was really

[1:49:16]
times in a row. Like, it was really
mentally challenging summer. Uh but my
physical energy was the highest I've
ever had. Like honestly, I went on for
seven weeks. Few days of here and there,
maybe five across the seven weeks. Uh

[1:49:30]
maybe five across the seven weeks. Uh
max intensity, high energy, no problem.
And I'm pretty sure that's combination
of workout and
nutrition. Um meditation is quite
important for me. I don't spend a lot of
time meditating but just like five

[1:49:46]
time meditating but just like five
minutes before session kind of centers
me little bit you know rem remind me um
yeah h how how to approach this session
what's the objective the objective is to
play my best game being my intuition

[1:50:01]
play my best game being my intuition
like just centers me quiet the mind rest
my mind so I have more stamina um so
yeah in u meditation workout and then
there's a few other things I like to do
but it's not every day like cold
exposure. Uh basically all those things

[1:50:17]
exposure. Uh basically all those things
they are kind of regulating your levels
of you know excite excitement or like I
feel like workout takes me up. Uh hot
shower takes me down cold shower takes
me up medit meditation takes me down and

[1:50:30]
me up medit meditation takes me down and
they can you can really regulate and end
up in that sweet spot where you feel
like oh my god for six hours you're
flying you're just like high energy the
time flies. you like feel like you take
a lot of decisions and that's the zone
where I want to be.

[1:50:45]
where I want to be.
I like how you touched on there as well
how some things are getting you higher
and some things are like bring you down
a little bit and I feel like the mistake
people often make is they want to be
high all the time and they're in a bit
of a low moment. They're like caffeine
more I need more stimulus I need to do
something else and they try to ride that
high for too long and realizing the body

[1:51:01]
high for too long and realizing the body
doesn't work that way. We have a nervous
system that likes to be highly excited
or highly activated and then come down
to recover. And even I really like those
little meditation breaks you take
because that's conscious going right if
we been really stimulated high energy.
Okay, I need to bring my nervous system
down to allow for some recovery because

[1:51:15]
down to allow for some recovery because
okay, ideally we could just stay high
all the time and maybe that would be uh
for performance we'd like that but in
reality that doesn't work. So we need to
look at our days and go right where do I
create some downtime? which activities
am I currently doing that are activating
me and which activities am I doing that
are lower in activation and trying to

[1:51:30]
are lower in activation and trying to
get that balance for yourself so you
feel like you're recovering well because
I know for myself for example I used to
push activation too hard so I used to do
too much and then on my off days when I
had to recover like ice bath but I used
to do like ice for a long time then
sauna for a long time then back and
forth between them and then I used to be

[1:51:45]
forth between them and then I used to be
like I'm burning out here what's going
on and I realized even when I was trying
to recover I was just pushing the
activation too high it's like no you
should be lowering the activation on
these days so just understand for
yourself in certain times of your days,
weeks, what are you trying to achieve?
And trying to find those balance points
where you have time in nature, you have

[1:52:01]
where you have time in nature, you have
time to uh calm yourself down to go
alongside the the high intensity stuff.
I think for poker players, it's more
important because poker by default is
going to be highly activated. I have a
friend who played um this one the scoops
and he got the the final table of a big
event and he had a whoop tracker on his

[1:52:16]
event and he had a whoop tracker on his
on his wrist the whole time and he
showed me the data from it and it was
terrifying. So the whoop has stress
levels and it has low, medium, and high.
I have high maybe 20 minutes a day, 30
minutes, and that's generally heavy
squats, heavy deadlifts. He had 10 hours

[1:52:31]
squats, heavy deadlifts. He had 10 hours
straight of high in like high stress,
like chronic stress, like just bouncing
around this high one. He was really
burnt out after the the tournament
finished. But yeah, it just got me
think, oh wow, like the nervous system
and how much activated we are during
poker for a lot of people is super high,

[1:52:46]
poker for a lot of people is super high,
especially if you play MTS or final
tables and things like that. So
acknowledging that and go right well I
need to fit in some recovery. I'm not a
machine like I need to have some
downtime so I can actually perform at a
high level. It's understand that
oscillation between high performance
then recovery and trying to find that

[1:53:01]
then recovery and trying to find that
balance. I know recovery can be a boring
topic but it is something you got to
consider if you want to be a high
performer. Recovery needs to be like
really front of mind. Like you can only
perform as well as you can recover from
because over time you think about a gym
workout. If you work out every day but
like you're not recovering very quickly

[1:53:15]
like you're not recovering very quickly
the performance has dropped through the
floor. So you can push as hard as you
want and keep trying to go, but now
recovery is the the the ceiling almost
of how far you can go with it. So yeah,
I really like that you touched on that
kind of increasing and decreasing. So I
really think about it the same way in
terms of the nervous system, how if you

[1:53:30]
terms of the nervous system, how if you
want to perform, we've got to fit in and
make time in all honesty for downtime to
recover to to lower that response. Yeah.
Yeah, for sure. And eventually it's not
even sacrificing time because you're
going to be 3% more intense, 4% more

[1:53:47]
going to be 3% more intense, 4% more
focused, uh 5% more this and that. And
then you're going to just use better
your time, right? And so the hours you
are actually going to be productive if
you do all those things right are going
to be much more productive. And then

[1:54:00]
to be much more productive. And then
eventually even if you are 5% less
productive, it's you're still going to
feel much better. And so if your goal is
to be the most productive person in the
entire world, maybe you're going to have
to be unhealthy. But for 99.9% of the

[1:54:16]
to be unhealthy. But for 99.9% of the
people like we said where happiness is
eventually the end goal, you know,
you're going to feel more happy. You're
going to have 3% less money after 10
years. Who cares? You're going to be in
good health. Maybe you're not going to
have to pay for health care or sick
care. Uh you know, there's so many other

[1:54:31]
care. Uh you know, there's so many other
consequences like we said. And so
eventually if you live more happy you
know what else can you ask like the rest
is going to follow good decisions good
attraction good energies you know things
are going to fall into places when you
are yourself I think showing up as your

[1:54:45]
are yourself I think showing up as your
best self and and being healthy and
happy. Love it. And yeah as you
mentioned that ability to think a bit
more longterm rather than like the
moment to moment dayto-day. Once you do
think long term the equation gets so
skewed towards health like it's just
like it's uncomprehendable. Like I think

[1:55:00]
like it's uncomprehendable. Like I think
all of us in 20 years time would give
almost all the money we've got to be
back to where we are in terms of our
health and we kind of know that's true
but we're like yeah yeah but we make all
these weird decisions in the moment but
realize like health is going to be super
important like in the future we know
that and it's also it's important now.
So once we link those together I think

[1:55:16]
So once we link those together I think
it becomes very easy to to make the
changes or the decisions that you need
to make to uh to prioritize health. All
right rene for you any routines you do
on a regular basis that we haven't
touched on that are powerful for you. I
feel like also I wanted to add to that.

[1:55:30]
feel like also I wanted to add to that.
I feel like if you go
down the the track of trying to optimize
for performance while initially it can
be you know to perform at good at the
poker tables but then exactly what
Thomas said you just notice you start to
feel better you notice other areas of

[1:55:45]
feel better you notice other areas of
your life start to improve at some point
you just get addicted to feeling good
like you don't want to go back to to
feeling bad you know like nowadays when
when you know my sleep is a bit is is
not great it's like I feel bad I don't
want to feel bad so Therefore, you know,

[1:56:01]
want to feel bad so Therefore, you know,
I I prefer to go to bed early, so I had
a good night of sleep. Or when I eat bad
food, I feel bad afterwards. So, it's no
longer a it's no longer a temptation as
well, right? For example, with nutrition
or exercise or all that type of stuff.

[1:56:16]
or exercise or all that type of stuff.
When you for example, you ask me about
like routines. I don't even see these
things anymore as routines like
nutrition like taking in good nutrition
like like what you said, Thomas,
avoiding sugar, stuff like that. Yeah,
it's it's I I've been doing this
probably for I don't know 16 years. Like

[1:56:31]
probably for I don't know 16 years. Like
I I don't think about it anymore. It's
just it's people say, "Oh, you this is
your diet. It's not a diet. What do you
mean? It's just it's just how I eat, you
know." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 100%. Um
I think something that helps us to build
good routines is to focus on how we feel

[1:56:48]
good routines is to focus on how we feel
right after that routine. Right. And so
you mentioned it Renee, I completely
agree. Uh food is the same for me. I've
become so you know into my my own
nutrition and what makes me feel good

[1:57:01]
nutrition and what makes me feel good
then when I go to restaurant or when I
eat something that is not good for me I
feel so terrible after that I'm like man
that's not worth it like man I cannot
wait to go home and eat my own food and
you know uh we had a trip in Japan last

[1:57:17]
you know uh we had a trip in Japan last
year with my wife and I went crazy uh I
went to taste all the food I wanted all
the ramen and all the, you know, the
curries and the sushies and everything.
I was so happy I was tasting all the

[1:57:32]
I was so happy I was tasting all the
great food. And you know what? After a
few weeks in, I really noticed, man, I
feel like [ __ ] Like, I feel so tired.
Even if I sleep long, I don't exercise
so much anymore because we are traveling
a lot. And I was, we were talking, we

[1:57:46]
a lot. And I was, we were talking, we
were like, those short moments of
happiness when I eat those food are
great and they're good memories. But
overall, I look back at the trip and I'm
like, I don't think I've, you know, I've
been my happiest. I really feel like I
could have lived this trip more happily.

[1:58:01]
could have lived this trip more happily.
And it was honestly just habits that,
you know, weren't nourishing me and and
weren't recovering me and weren't Yeah.
making me function well. I have the same
like you you you may have the same. I

[1:58:15]
like you you you may have the same. I
know you don't live in your initial
country, right? I believe you're
currently in Costa Rica. I live in
Brazil. When I have like friends over
for a week, for example, we basically
try to we go out to dinner every night,
but after the week, after like five
nights, I'm like, I don't I don't want

[1:58:30]
nights, I'm like, I don't I don't want
to anymore. I just want to eat my own
food, you know? It's like, sure, it's
nice. It's exactly what you said. When I
order it, it's nice. Maybe actually
fifth or sixth day, at some point it's
not so nice anymore. Doesn't matter
which restaurant I go to. Uh but then
you just want to go back to to to the

[1:58:45]
you just want to go back to to to the
basics, right? because you know that's
and also I feel often it's almost like I
feel sort of obligated to order
something different because we went out
for dinner where I could also still on
the menu order something that's you know
a bit more align but I'm like no yeah

[1:59:00]
a bit more align but I'm like no yeah
but I'm here now I'm not going to order
what I already eat at home right uh so
which is fine you know if you do that
once a week or something but if if it's
repetitive yeah I I for me it's best if
I just go back to to my diet uh that

[1:59:16]
I just go back to to my diet uh that
just I know works for me and same with
exercise like I don't think about it you
know it's just like minimum requirements
a couple times sports a week couple
times gyms a week just like minimum
requirements then we talk about like
actual habits I've always struggled with

[1:59:30]
actual habits I've always struggled with
like the consistency in like meditation
or for example uh cold showers I feel
like for me I really need to raise the
necessity for that so let's say for
example I play a poker
session meditating before or a cold
shower before is almost like a

[1:59:45]
shower before is almost like a
no-brainer training because there's
direct consequence. I notice immediate
results, right? You you mentioned
obviously I know that, for example,
meditation will have good long-term
effects, but there's no direct
short-term consequence if I didn't
meditate. Whereas, if I play poker
afterwards, there is direct consequence.

[2:00:00]
afterwards, there is direct consequence.
I notice my brain just doesn't work the
same if I didn't do a meditation before,
right? Like you said, it centers me. I
set my attention. So then if I don't do
it, I have direct I get direct feedback
and I get punished sort of directly that
I didn't do it. So therefore, if if I

[2:00:15]
I didn't do it. So therefore, if if I
play poker, I would easily do it. But if
I don't play poker, I'm like, you know,
it's all it's basically what I'm saying
is I care more about my short-term
outcome of my poker session than the
long-term quality of my life. Almost if

[2:00:31]
long-term quality of my life. Almost if
you want to zoom it out. It's pretty
shocking actually.
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I think I think
it's just we are so bad at that like you
said. So yeah, I can relate to that
where some things I also don't do during

[2:00:48]
where some things I also don't do during
my days off and I feel like it would
make me just a better person and more
happy to do them. Um, but I have hopes
because it's changing. For example,
nowadays I love to go to the gym on a

[2:01:00]
nowadays I love to go to the gym on a
day off because I don't have an agenda
and I don't have a goal. I can just be
here and do what what I want and it just
feels great. And if I want to spend two
hours here taking breaks, 10 minute
breaks between each set, like I can I

[2:01:15]
breaks between each set, like I can I
can just take a little coffee, enjoy my
coffee, like you know. So I start to see
the the the pleasure in the process even
outside of the performance, but not
everywhere still like meditation for
example is definitely one thing that I

[2:01:30]
example is definitely one thing that I
don't do during my days off, but it
would be good to recover better. Yeah, I
sh I I I share that one with you. So, so
you can also relate like you know that
you should be doing it because you have
the immediate results. I have a a quick
hack for people in Vegas by the way. Um

[2:01:46]
hack for people in Vegas by the way. Um
that's that's a meditation I do during
my days off. It's um floating tank. So,
you know, there man, it's absolutely
amazing. I go out from there, my senses

[2:02:00]
amazing. I go out from there, my senses
are enhanced. Like I smell thing in my
car I haven't smelled in three weeks.
Like it's crazy. the brain is so
restored that it can intake more signal
and like I have more patience and
empathy and and I'm a great husband for
at least 24 hours. So yeah, it's it's

[2:02:15]
at least 24 hours. So yeah, it's it's
like yeah, it's it's a really it's a
really it's a really nice experience. Uh
people like I said especially people
have trouble slowing down maybe don't
take an hour and a half or something
straight away because I can imagine
you'll freak out but maybe build it up a
little bit slowly. But yeah, it's

[2:02:31]
little bit slowly. But yeah, it's
definitely I think for for recovery, I
think it's what you said, right? Like
meditation recovers you even better than
sleep. I mean, an hour in a in in a tank
like that. Uh yeah, it it does wonders,
especially on a long trip like that. I
was actually wondering uh especially

[2:02:45]
was actually wondering uh especially
with live poker, like I said, I I play
it very unfrequently, but if I play a
live tournament or something, these
often go quite long. You even said like
12 hour days and then basically
sometimes you have to already show up
for day two 9 hours after day one finish

[2:03:00]
for day two 9 hours after day one finish
for example. How do you but h how do you
transition from okay last end of the day
you know I'm still want to be as sharp
as possible and try to make the best
decisions possible to an hour later I
would prefer to already be in deep sleep
so I can recover properly to to perform

[2:03:17]
so I can recover properly to to perform
day two. Most players go to the bar but
I have a feeling you don't go to the
bar. What's what What would be a more
optimal way to do this? Um, again, many
tools. Um, as soon as the last hand is

[2:03:30]
tools. Um, as soon as the last hand is
finished, red glass is on, you know, um,
increase the production of melatonin.
Uh, don't eat too much before sleep
time. So, I think ideally four hours.
So, if you aim to go to bed at 2:00
a.m., have your last meal at 10:00.

[2:03:48]
a.m., have your last meal at 10:00.
Um, take a few supplements that improve
sleep quality. You know, something very
like magnesium, 5HTP, like there's
there's a bunch. Uh, little bit of yoga,

[2:04:00]
there's a bunch. Uh, little bit of yoga,
some some kind of movement I think is
good to release and and circulate all
the hormones. You have had adrenaline
for 12 hours, right? So, little yoga,
little walk evening, something kind of
chilled. Yeah. Little meditation. Avoid
the screens. uh or if you do really use

[2:04:16]
the screens. uh or if you do really use
the red glasses, you know, bunch of
tools and then it can go really fast.
Uh sometimes let's say you have a D6
minivan. I don't know how it feels like.
I hope I will one day. Uh maybe you are,

[2:04:30]
I hope I will one day. Uh maybe you are,
you know, overly excited, but those
tools are going to help you somehow. You
know, you're going to have a slightly
better sleep. But then what will matter
now has been how how you have been
showing showing up for the last two
weeks. you know, have you been
consistent with your sleep and your

[2:04:45]
consistent with your sleep and your
nutrition and your workout uh and your
meditations? If yes, I think you're
ready to roll and you're just going to
have a huge edge on the guys who are not
ready and who are exhausted and stressed
and everything and malnourished and

[2:05:01]
and everything and malnourished and
whatever you whatnot, right? So, yeah,
that's where the consistency also plays
and that's what we are bad at planning
ahead, right? But that could matter a
lot. It's just hard to plan it and to to
feel it right

[2:05:15]
feel it right
now. I heard you talk in the
conversation with Adam. I heard you
talked about uh hiring coaches in
general. It seems like you know you you
look for resources whether it be books,
podcast, courses, and I heard you
mention hiring coaches. Which coaches

[2:05:32]
mention hiring coaches. Which coaches
have you hired in your career? And what
are like some of the biggest lessons
that you've learned from them?
Um, so I've had coaches in poker
naturally and I've had coaches in other

[2:05:46]
naturally and I've had coaches in other
areas of life. I've had a a high
performance coach. So that was more for
the Okay, there was like a habit,
health, nutrition coach that was very
practical and and tangible wins, right?

[2:06:00]
practical and and tangible wins, right?
And then there was a performance coach
and that was more soft skills that I was
very bad at. I'm very good at hard
skills as an engineer, very bad at soft
skills. So clarity um you know um
courage um plan planning your agenda

[2:06:17]
courage um plan planning your agenda
your days your weeks your your year
actually um like there's so many things
that feels I'm even having a hard time
to explain it but then when I was
getting the coach and when basically
what we were doing is just taking an

[2:06:30]
what we were doing is just taking an
hour
to so that I ask like she would ask
myself the hard question and I would
have to think about it little bit like
what kind of husband you want to be.
Like who thinks about that? Nobody,
right? But somebody that you paid tell

[2:06:45]
right? But somebody that you paid tell
you, okay, we're going to focus on that
for 20 minutes, then you do it, right?
And so, yeah, overall any kind of coach
I've had, I've always been so happy with
the value. I feel like when you have a
professional who is an expert in their
field and is willing to share that with

[2:07:00]
field and is willing to share that with
you, you know, for a few hours, the
value again, it's really unvaluable. you
know, you cannot put a price on that.
That might impact the next 80 years of
my life. Like, it doesn't matter how
much it costs. Honestly, if it's

[2:07:15]
much it costs. Honestly, if it's
remotely reasonable, I think it's going
to be worth it. I've even had a coach in
uh the the name of the program was uh
sexual energy mastery. And so, that
sounds very sexual.

[2:07:30]
sounds very sexual.
And that kind of what I thought it would
be. But then there was so much more
around that. There was communication
with your partner. There was
communication with yourself or listening
to yourself or being honest with
yourself. There's so much more. Uh my

[2:07:45]
yourself. There's so much more. Uh my
relationship with my wife improved
drastically on all levels, right? Just
by listening more to myself, by
communing the communication. um like and
so like I can I can really tell that I
think any type of coaching in any area

[2:08:02]
think any type of coaching in any area
in my experience exceeds my
expectations. So I'm probably going to
hire a lot of random coaches throughout
my life. If you are a charlatan, you
have a spot here. You you can contact me

[2:08:16]
have a spot here. You you can contact me
and I will I will give you action.
It's funny because people's like in in
terms of marketing, right? you try to
sell uh you sell kind of the dream
outcome, right? So that course that you
did, it kind of sold you the dream

[2:08:31]
did, it kind of sold you the dream
outcome, but then it taught you the
tools how to get there, right? So the
course itself is not necessarily only
about the dream outcome. Like I said,
it's about communication because if
there's less uh friction between you and
your partner and you communicate your

[2:08:45]
your partner and you communicate your
needs more clearly, you'll both feel
more satisfied, more loved and therefore
more open uh and more connected, which
you know will lead to better uh better
sexual chemistry for example. Yeah,
exactly. More happy showing up in the

[2:09:02]
exactly. More happy showing up in the
right way to maintain the polarity in a
relationship type of stuff. Yeah, 100%.
Yeah. You mentioned that uh these
coaches you pay them to uh to ask you
usually the questions that you know you

[2:09:15]
usually the questions that you know you
paid them because you sort of wanted to
hear them but at the same time when the
question is like oh they always ask this
question that I didn't really want to
think about. What is like the toughest
question uh uh that that that that they
taught you to or that they ask you to
think about?

[2:09:32]
Um I would say it usually comes in the
areas of like
uh for
example
what do you think you should be doing to

[2:09:49]
what do you think you should be doing to
improve your results but you're not
currently doing right now? What is
something you could do to improve you
know the the category we are talking
about in the coaching where whatever it
is can be poker can be outside but

[2:10:01]
is can be poker can be outside but
you're currently not doing you know and
why is that and when you start to dig
and you find the wise and then sometimes
you have to again the ego takes a hit
and it's like okay I'm I'm not doing it

[2:10:16]
and it's like okay I'm I'm not doing it
because I'm scared uh of change for
example or I'm not doing it because um
maybe
afraid slightly remotely afraid that
people will not love me for who I am
exactly and will judge me right and so

[2:10:30]
exactly and will judge me right and so
those are the hard questions but
eventually when you find the answers um
you're like you feel free and also when
you go to face those deep fears that you
don't look at you actually realize
they're not that scary so what if

[2:10:45]
they're not that scary so what if
somebody judges you then what you're
like oh wait nothing actually nothing
has changed in my
Uh, so that wasn't that bad, right? And
so you kind of open some boxes and you
thought it was a huge monster in there
and then there's nothing and like, oh,

[2:11:01]
and then there's nothing and like, oh,
oh, there's a small monster there and it
flies away. That wasn't that bad, right?
Yeah. We we we we make it worse in our
head. I I I did a coaching program I
think end last year and in there there
was a session as well where

[2:11:15]
was a session as well where
um there was an exercise where it kind
of had you had to start with what I
don't want you to know about me. So this
was like a group session. We were I
think six guys or something and yeah
basically you had to go you had to go
what I got what I don't want you to know

[2:11:31]
what I got what I don't want you to know
about me or what I'm most ashamed of. Oh
man that's cool. And you had to and you
had to start and you had to start saying
these things and obviously in the
beginning it's like oh [ __ ] oh you know
when I when it's going to be my turn at
some point but then I remember I was
finished and then the other people and

[2:11:45]
finished and then the other people and
then more started to come up and say hey
can can I share more because it felt
amazing you know to get to get the [ __ ]
out of your out of your chest you know
uh so it's it's really interesting like
obviously naturally we try to
unconsciously you know try to show up or

[2:12:02]
unconsciously you know try to show up or
hide certain things that we're maybe
uncertain about uh but exercises like
that and environments like that right
it's very important obviously that you
feel comfortable in sharing it in the
environment in environment where I was I
felt very comfortable

[2:12:15]
felt very comfortable
uh then it's just such a relief and I
felt great man afterwards it's like wow
this is amazing you know
yeah for sure
I want to before we wrap this up I want
to do a couple of reflection uh
reflection questions on on your I think

[2:12:32]
reflection questions on on your I think
10 year 10 in your poker career. Um,
what would you say the is the most
important lesson that poker has taught
you? Uh, many many to choose

[2:12:48]
from.
Um, I
think I already had a strong belief
about
myself. Uh, so I'm not going to pick

[2:13:00]
myself. Uh, so I'm not going to pick
that one. I think something I learned
the hard way was
that it's important to get out of your
comfort zone. Um, if you want to succeed
and eventually if you want to be

[2:13:16]
and eventually if you want to be
happy or the most happy you can be, it's
important to get out of your comfort
zone. Um, to face change, to accept that
it might be scary, but usually it's
scary
because again, you don't really look at
it. you just think it's there, like, "Oh

[2:13:31]
it. you just think it's there, like, "Oh
my god, it's so scary." And then if you
actually look at the process to go from
here to there, it's like Adam said, it's
just like 17 simple steps. Oh my god,
that wasn't that that bad. Um, and I've
had that a few times where when I was

[2:13:45]
had that a few times where when I was
playing CD and goes, for example,
Pyolver came out that was that terrible
looking awful solver, super aric like
horrible to look at, right? Looks really
hard to manipulate and everything. And I

[2:14:00]
hard to manipulate and everything. And I
was like, man, I don't want to do that.
That feels hard. That honestly feels
hard to download that program, start to
play around, run everything by myself,
put 200 hours to know how to play post
flop. And I didn't do it in the
beginning. And yeah, what do you know?

[2:14:15]
beginning. And yeah, what do you know?
The best players that were crashing the
high stakes at that time were doing it.
And I wasn't one of them, right? Um,
couple years
later, I think it was, yeah, six max
hypers became popular. So, everybody was
playing six mac turbos on start and then

[2:14:33]
playing six mac turbos on start and then
six max hypers became popular. And
again, I was like, that's a different
format. I'm going to have to relearn
everything. Uh, I don't really want to
face that change. Like, I'm I'm good now
here in my zone, like, you know,

[2:14:45]
here in my zone, like, you know,
six-pack turbos. So, I didn't do it
right away. Uh again the guys who went
there first started to learn first
became the best. Uh soon enough six Mac
turbos died. I had I was forced to go to
six hypers and I was late, right? And so

[2:15:01]
six hypers and I was late, right? And so
few times like that I realized that my
fear of change and going out of my
comfort zone limited me and then really
costed me and I think going further you
know I know that better but also I know

[2:15:15]
know I know that better but also I know
for example after poker probably I would
like to have a career in business. I
would like to play that game creating
business that kind of stuff. Um, and I
already know that I'm going to be afraid
of the change and the going outside of
the comfort zone, but at least I know

[2:15:30]
the comfort zone, but at least I know
that I have to go against that fear. You
know, I learned that. So now I just have
to have the discipline to implement it.
But I I would say that's the most
valuable lesson.
What is an area you feel like uh you're
currently too much in your comfort zone
and you should probably step out of it?

[2:15:47]
and you should probably step out of it?
Nice question.
Um, I would say in poker it's
probably streamlining my coaching. Um, I

[2:16:01]
probably streamlining my coaching. Um, I
want to do more one-on-one. I want to I
think I would like to do more coaching
without adding workload to my plate. And
I think I can do that by being smart and
rearranging some commitments, you know.

[2:16:17]
rearranging some commitments, you know.
Um, so there I could honestly just put a
little bit of work and do more. And I
think outside of poker,
um, well, I started that big, you know,
program that I mentioned to Jared, uh,

[2:16:32]
program that I mentioned to Jared, uh,
which is called life book on Mind
Valley, which is absolutely amazing. I
really recommend anybody who's ready to
do some self-rowth to have a look at.
Uh, and that one I could do more now. I
I stopped for Triton, but the Triton

[2:16:46]
I stopped for Triton, but the Triton
excuse has has expired for like 10 days.
So now I I really have to get back on.
Yeah,
thanks. I uh I I will put some
accountability on myself as well because
like I I I I know that I should be for
example, I mentioned the coaching

[2:17:01]
example, I mentioned the coaching
program I went to and it was already on
my list. It was like, oh yeah, I need to
I need to go through my notes again
because you know how it goes, right?
when you're in it, you know, so you
write all these things down and then in
the end you maybe 20% or 30%, you know,
you start applying which already better

[2:17:15]
you start applying which already better
than nothing, right? But then sometimes
you have to revisit it to to remember
yourself, oh yeah, [ __ ] Yeah, at that
moment when I was in that state that
came so obvious to me, but now, you
know, due to life happening and you
know, I'm getting distracted, it doesn't
come natural to me. So sometimes it's

[2:17:30]
come natural to me. So sometimes it's
good to revisit your notes, right? kind
of kind of what we talked about earlier
the the the playbook that we had for
poker. Uh basically after that coaching
I also made kind of a playback of how a
playbook how I want to show up in in my
relationship right with my with with my
wife with my daughter. Uh so you know

[2:17:47]
wife with my daughter. Uh so you know
also I'm I'm now reflecting also what
what is something I should I should I
should actually be doing it. That's
definitely something as well. What about
you
Adam? Nice. He can't hide. Yeah. Damn. I
thought I got away from this. Yes. Yeah.

[2:18:00]
thought I got away from this. Yes. Yeah.
So, I think for me, I'm going through a
stage of putting more content out there
in the not the non-poker world, let's
call it, the real world, and being more
vulnerable, sharing my experiences. So,
I recently started a blog. I've done
five blog posts where I'm kind of
sharing vulnerable experiences. I
recently did a Passa retreats where I

[2:18:16]
recently did a Passa retreats where I
had to deal with a lot of emotions and
vulnerable stuff. So, I've started
sharing my experience with that. I've
wrote a blog on self-worth and
challenges with selfworth. And yes, it's
basically being able to uh share parts
of myself, kind of what Rene said, the
parts of yourself where you're like,
I've kind of kept this a bit hidden, but

[2:18:30]
I've kind of kept this a bit hidden, but
I struggled with these in times and kind
of taken off the role of the coach coach
for a while to just share my
experiences. So, I'm currently on that
journey. So, I'm quite happy I've taken
steps like towards that the last few
months, but just continuing that
momentum and then not getting
sidetracked and going, "Yeah, I've done

[2:18:45]
sidetracked and going, "Yeah, I've done
that." And I'm back into my lane now. I
want to keep being able to just share
things authentically. And yeah,
sometimes that's going to be
uncomfortable because a lot of stuff I'm
sharing is not from a place of wisdom,
but a place of experience of this is
what I went through. Hope it helps for
somebody else. So yeah, that's kind of

[2:19:00]
somebody else. So yeah, that's kind of
where where I'm looking at it. Nice. Do
you feel like it also gets harder as you
are a coach especially, you know, you
you might say things to or you know, we
we sometimes say things here on this
podcast that we think is important, but
then next day, you know, I go out and do

[2:19:16]
then next day, you know, I go out and do
something completely different myself.
Do do you feel like there's an extra
sort of hurdle in being open and and
sharing stuff like that because of kind
of the sort of example role that you
have? Right. I think there is, but I
think it's all just a construct in your

[2:19:31]
think it's all just a construct in your
head and you put on a role of I'm the
coach. I need the answers and you play
that role. You play it so well you're
like that's my role. And you think
taking a backseat of being more vulner
vulnerable would be a downside because
people expect something else from you.
I'm making the assumption that my

[2:19:45]
I'm making the assumption that my
intuition is telling me that is a false
belief and that actually being more
vulnerable will connect with more people
and anyone who doesn't connect with
because you didn't sound clever or know
the answers. That's okay. I'll lose
those people. See, I think it's uh it
definitely is harder from a the mindset
of of a role. But once you put that role

[2:20:01]
of of a role. But once you put that role
down and for me, I've had to give myself
permission to put the role down. Even as
I'm writing, my kind of way of teaching
is always action items. This is what you
need to do. This is how you get past
this. And I'm like I almost go to write
that section in my blog. like no action
items today. Just just end on the

[2:20:15]
items today. Just just end on the
reflection. Like it's it's like almost
like a the audience hasn't had the
action items. What are they going to do
with this information? So yeah, just
giving yourself permission to to share
things and to for me it's yeah putting
down the role so I can explore different
things. That's good. I definitely feel
like if if you put yourself out there

[2:20:31]
like if if you put yourself out there
vulnerable and you're authentic, I
definitely feel like it it gets you have
you have better connection and like the
people that you lose were probably not
the people you were interested anyway. I
remember actually I got some feedback
once on on on our coaching and then one

[2:20:46]
once on on on our coaching and then one
student said what I like about the Wacko
is that if he doesn't know he just says
he doesn't know instead of trying to
invent invent things right there's many
times hey guys I don't know may maybe
anyone else can jump in right and he

[2:21:00]
anyone else can jump in right and he
said that like as a point and I was like
oh wait this is not normal right do
people do people not say that they don't
know or like I I cannot know at all
right it's hard to say you don't know
especially as you're the coach someone
asks you the question it's like well

[2:21:15]
asks you the question it's like well
should I know should should I make
something up says yeah it's hard to
relinquish but also gives the person
who's asking you some kind of
credibility with you like all right
doesn't know he says he doesn't know and
then when he does say something it's got
more credibility I got some friends who
run a big business and they were taking

[2:21:30]
run a big business and they were taking
on some marketing guys to run their
websites and there was lots of things
like we don't know this we don't know
this like oh this is awesome these guys
keep telling me all the things they
don't know so when they say they do know
something I'm like okay cool these guys
are good at this
We're not good at that things. So, yeah,
but it is hard cuz the ego likes to have
answers. I struggle with this. I'm I

[2:21:45]
answers. I struggle with this. I'm I
always like to have some sort of answer.
At least I I struggle to say that I
don't know. Stop. Stop. Full stop. I
don't know. But and then I'll try to dig
my way out of it. So, yeah, I can relate
to that. But I think it's a it's a good
a good trait to have. I have some rapid
fire questions. So, the way this is
going to work, I'm going to ask you the

[2:22:00]
going to work, I'm going to ask you the
question. I want you to answer as short
as possible and the first thing that
comes to mind. All right. All right.
Your favorite meal after a big poker
win. Ooh.
Carbs. Um, yeah. What carbs? Eddie
carbs. Carbs refill. Player you'd least

[2:22:16]
carbs. Carbs refill. Player you'd least
like to see on your left at a final
table. Uh, I don't know if I want to say
it. Final table. Probably I want to say
somebody like Ponakov or Iketon maybe. A

[2:22:30]
somebody like Ponakov or Iketon maybe. A
weird superstition or habit you have
before playing. Uh,
weird. Masturbating.
[Laughter]
Best purchase under $100 that improved
your game of life. Um,

[2:22:45]
your game of life. Um,
$100. Best
purchase. Maybe those red glasses. I
really love them. Or like barefoot shoes
recently.
Great purchase. I've also recently
joined the barefoot crew. One word your
partner would use to describe you.

[2:23:00]
partner would use to describe you.
Performer. I don't know.
One word you would use to describe your
poker game. exploitative.
First thing you would do if you won the
World Series of Poker main event,
buy a few houses. I really want to have

[2:23:16]
buy a few houses. I really want to have
my dojoos like uh with Sona and
Flotation Tank and everything. And I
want to have one in Vegas, one in Costa
Rica, one in Europe. So yeah, that was a
thing. Amazing. If poker disappeared
tomorrow, what would you do?

[2:23:30]
tomorrow, what would you do?
Create probably a business in something
that I believe in can make the world a
better place.
There's a big Hollywood movie about to
be made about you and your life. Who's
playing you? I'm not I'm really bad at
actors. Um I have no idea. I'm too bad

[2:23:46]
actors. Um I have no idea. I'm too bad
at it. Yeah.
Um maybe Ryan Gosling. I'm I'm going to
be humble here. Yeah. It's a Hollywood
movie maybe. Pick a pick an Alist. All
right. That's a rapid fire. I like his
humor. Rapid fire is over. Just two more

[2:24:02]
humor. Rapid fire is over. Just two more
quick questions for me. What are you
most proud of in your po career?
Um, I'm very happy with where I am at
right now performing at high stakes and
coaching at the high

[2:24:15]
coaching at the high
level. So, I'm very satisfied with that
right now. All right. And then finally,
what is your main takeaway that you
would love the audience to take away
from this wide ranging conversation
we've had today? H well, probably the
main takeaway I think comes back to

[2:24:31]
main takeaway I think comes back to
awareness. like you said and
consciousness that you can actually
whoever you are if you are already
listening to this then it's 100%
guaranteed that you can do and become
anything you want in life you it just

[2:24:46]
anything you want in life you it just
might take work and dedication and might
take 40 years to become an astronaut or
whatever but like really eventually you
can do anything so if you want to be a
top rushing high stakes it's a decision
if you're not it's because you've not
decided to be one and if you want to be

[2:25:01]
decided to be one and if you want to be
one maybe takes you one, two, three,
five years.
What a powerful ending. Thank you so
much for your time today, Thomas. We
really appreciate this conversation and
yeah, thank you so much. Thank you guys.
That was that was a blast. It was a real
pleasure. What a great conversation that

[2:25:16]
pleasure. What a great conversation that
was. Thomas, thanks again for coming on
and sharing your journey with us. Adam,
main takeaways of today's conversation.
So many interesting topics that we went
super deep on. when you guys were
chatting about intuition and fear. I

[2:25:30]
chatting about intuition and fear. I
thought that was fascinating and Thomas'
kind of approach to how to trust his
intuition and we went down the rabbit
hole of intuition versus fear and how a
lot of spots it can be quite close and
there's almost like two voices. One is
an intuitive voice, one's a kind of
fear-based one and trying to distinguish

[2:25:45]
fear-based one and trying to distinguish
which one is which and then strengthen
that intuition over time. I think we
went on a really good deep dive into
understanding that at a high level but
also practically how to come past it and
we kind of got to the point where fear
is almost like protect from mistakes. So
wanted it's a protection mechanism and

[2:26:01]
wanted it's a protection mechanism and
understanding your tendencies when you
have when he makes decisions the
tendencies that you have. So for example
let's say Renee for example will often
overfold and spots when he's on a
downswing. So that's a tendency based on
fear. So learn to spot your own
tendency. We came to that conclusion was

[2:26:15]
tendency. We came to that conclusion was
good and then going against that pushing
back on that tendency and strength that
intuition. And then the kind of take
home was learn to trust yourself and
learn to go for your best efforts. And
how Thomas was saying the difference
between trusting your intuition and
making a mistake compared to not
trusting your intuition and making a

[2:26:30]
trusting your intuition and making a
mistake. And this I knew I should have
did this but I didn't. I learned over
time to get repetitions in of trusting
yourself in making mistakes. But you go
on your best assumptions and your best
effort at that moment. I think we did a
massive deep dive. I have to relisten to
that myself to uh unpack it. But there's
a lot into understand intuition in a

[2:26:46]
a lot into understand intuition in a
very practical way. Next thing was how
to make changes. We did a lot of things
on how to upgrade yourself, how to
choose your character, become the
version of yourself you want to be. I
thought that was very practical in terms
of awareness of where you are currently.
Having a kind of blueprint of what who
you want to be going forward. So like

[2:27:01]
you want to be going forward. So like
mapped out the person you want to be.
Accepting where you are currently as
well. So you're not like kind of guilt
tripping yourself for not being where
you want to be. And then make take that
next step. We talked a lot about the
next step we need to take. The change
starts now. It starts the next step. We
can get overwhelmed as you were touching

[2:27:15]
can get overwhelmed as you were touching
on Rene and that conversation. But also
it comes down to simply what do I need
to do now to move towards my my goals or
to the vision I want to be which then I
think Thomas did a really good section
on beliefs as well and you really
practically broke down how to upgrade
beliefs because I think this is a big
part of making changes. Yes, we can look

[2:27:30]
part of making changes. Yes, we can look
at habits, routines but under the
service we got beliefs which are the
stories we tell ourselves which can
influence every behavior we make. And he
talked about becoming aware of your
beliefs first of all. Then he talked
about questioning your beliefs. Which
beliefs are true? Which beliefs are not
true? What what where this belief come

[2:27:45]
true? What what where this belief come
from? And then changing your beliefs and
really changing the way you tell stories
to yourself and that kind of inner voice
we have in our minds. We have the power
to change it. And then over time you've
got to have repetitions of installing a
new belief system over an old one. Now
this can seem if you haven't done work
in this area can seem like, oh, does

[2:28:00]
in this area can seem like, oh, does
that actually work? But when you
actually slow it down and you look at
thought patterns, they're nothing
special. This is the thought the mind
comes up with based on an old story an
old pattern and often we don't question
them. we don't have conscious control of
it and we end up living like kind of a
programmed life in a way kind of
conditioned from society conditioned

[2:28:15]
conditioned from society conditioned
from things around us based on our past
experiences and once we sort of question
it we're like ah I've been holding on to
this story for quite a while now huh
that was true when I was seven it was
true when I was 10 not really true now
and we sort of really push back against
these stories and then we create new
ones and it's amazing how many changes

[2:28:31]
ones and it's amazing how many changes
we can make in our life when we drop old
stories give ourselves permission to
have new stories and new beliefs and
that can really empower things going
forwards and then finally I really like
the conversation around performance. We
really got some amazing practical tips
on that. But also, I love how he brought

[2:28:45]
on that. But also, I love how he brought
kind of performance and happiness and
feeling good all into one package. I
really like that because I feel like for
poker players for it to stick for
performance habits and to for health to
be a part of their lives, they've got to
make that connection for themselves with
performance and feeling good and health

[2:29:00]
performance and feeling good and health
are the same thing. Like over smaller
samples, as Thomas was talking about, in
the short term, it might not matter. No
matter what you eat, no matter matter
how you sleep, but over the long term,
it it matters so much. It really really
impacts every part of your functioning,
your decision- making, how you feel, and
how you perform. So, yeah, I really

[2:29:16]
how you perform. So, yeah, I really
liked how practically he broke it down
into uh you talk about cognitive
athletes, which I I use that term as
well, or poker athletes. And yeah,
really starting to think about your
overall performance and your body as one
kind of entity and going how I show up

[2:29:30]
kind of entity and going how I show up
is a lot of little factors will impact
how I show up dayto-day. If I start
thinking long term in five years, 10
years, I've got to start looking after
myself now. And then for you as an
individual who are listening to this,
think about for yourself which are the
habits and behaviors you haven't got
around to. Oh yeah, I should do this but

[2:29:45]
around to. Oh yeah, I should do this but
I don't. And the question I think you as
Renee, what would you be doing? What
comfort zone are you currently in that
you step out of? Or I think Thomas
question was, what's one thing you
should be doing that you're not
currently to increase your performance?
Is it going to bed earlier? Is it not
scrolling your phone? Is it studying
more? So think about for yourself and

[2:30:00]
more? So think about for yourself and
then bring it back to that practicality
of one small change, one step now. Don't
overwhelm it. Don't create a a
three-year curriculum about a change.
Make one change now and start that path
straight away. So yeah, how about you
renew for
you? Yeah, you obviously you covered

[2:30:15]
you? Yeah, you obviously you covered
already quite a lot. I will focus mainly
on technical the from a technical
perspective. We talked a lot about
studying the impact of the parameters,
right? When you open the solver, he
really used it to play around with it.
He changed one parameter at the time to

[2:30:31]
He changed one parameter at the time to
see hey how does this actually impact
the strategy right and I think he gave
the example of for example uh the
imposition has initi bets but he doesn't
three bet the flop enough and he
suddenly saw that that had a huge impact

[2:30:45]
suddenly saw that that had a huge impact
on how much you can check race right
because you're going to overrealize your
equity so playing around with these kind
of parameters you can learn a lot about
how the game of poker actually works and
in the end that is your goal when you
study a solver, right? He even had a

[2:31:01]
study a solver, right? He even had a
phase where he started to solver and
started to play more GTO because a
solver also shows you GTO strategies,
but you shouldn't necessarily look at it
to try to implement GTO strategies,
right? You should look at it to
understand the game of poker at a deeper

[2:31:15]
understand the game of poker at a deeper
level to understand poker theory and
then from there okay it is useful to
understand GTO strategies because we can
use that information to figure out how
people are likely to screw up right some

[2:31:30]
people are likely to screw up right some
examples he gave on this were uh okay in
this spot it seems to be like the
bluffering range comes from a lot of
unnatural hands a lot of strong hands
check back a lot of active hands check
back and the blossom more complete
bananas for example, right? Or on the

[2:31:45]
bananas for example, right? Or on the
opposite when he was the aggressor, he
would look at the defend frequency like
oh wow that's quite a lot of hero
calling that our opponent has to do
likely that he's not going to be uh able
to to play this strategy correctly and
therefore exploit it. That's more how he
was using a solver. And when he builded

[2:32:01]
was using a solver. And when he builded
this strategy that was kind of like
laying the foundation, right? This is
not where your strategy ends. This is
not where playing poker ends, right? I
think this is a very big mistake
actually that a lot of players have is
that they then go out and they think,

[2:32:16]
that they then go out and they think,
well, this is my strategy. I'm now going
to put in the hours. No, he used that as
a baseline so he didn't have to think
about that, right, anymore. So that when
he went out to play, you could start to
gather more information and from there
make exploitative adjustments, right? So

[2:32:30]
make exploitative adjustments, right? So
what this baseline strategy allows you
to do is think more about the exploits.
Um, and then last but not least, we
talked a little bit about documenting
and how important that was and how he's
done it. Um, which was he kind of

[2:32:45]
done it. Um, which was he kind of
created the playbook for himself. This
is how Thomas plays poker. It was very
important that you summarize it at the
end, right? Because then if you don't
decide which strategy you're going to
play or how it's going to look, you
might get into spot be like, "Oh yeah, I
know all this information, but I haven't
I haven't structured it. I haven't come

[2:33:01]
I haven't structured it. I haven't come
to a conclusion for myself." So that's a
very important step about uh uh strategy
creation. That's very important. Yeah.
Overall, great talk. I think there was a
lot of knowledge in there. Want to thank
