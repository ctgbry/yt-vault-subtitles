basically the scientific uh method where

basically the scientific uh method where
you want to you know analyze the impact

[03:51]
you want to you know analyze the impact

[03:51]
you want to you know analyze the impact
of one parameter. So you only change

[03:53]
of one parameter. So you only change

[03:53]
of one parameter. So you only change
that parameter. You put it in a few

[03:55]
that parameter. You put it in a few

[03:55]
that parameter. You put it in a few
different situations and you see

[03:56]
different situations and you see

[03:56]
different situations and you see
different outputs and then you draw a

[03:58]
different outputs and then you draw a

[03:58]
different outputs and then you draw a
conclusion. and you say, "Hey, when I

[04:00]
conclusion. and you say, "Hey, when I

[04:00]
conclusion. and you say, "Hey, when I
change that only, it goes in that

[04:02]
change that only, it goes in that

[04:02]
change that only, it goes in that
direction, right?" Then you do the same

[04:04]
direction, right?" Then you do the same

[04:04]
direction, right?" Then you do the same
with another parameter and it goes in

[04:06]
with another parameter and it goes in

[04:06]
with another parameter and it goes in
the other direction. And then when you

[04:08]
the other direction. And then when you

[04:08]
the other direction. And then when you
do that with all the parameters,

[04:09]
do that with all the parameters,

[04:09]
do that with all the parameters,
eventually you kind of have an idea of

[04:11]
eventually you kind of have an idea of

[04:11]
eventually you kind of have an idea of

players obviously you use a solver and

uh yeah for sure one of I feel like the

sensitive believe it was is for example

[04:55]

the three bet on the flop. So let's say

[04:59]
the three bet on the flop. So let's say

[04:59]
the three bet on the flop. So let's say
your opponent bets C bets range button

[05:03]
your opponent bets C bets range button

[05:03]
your opponent bets C bets range button
big blind right and then you're in the

[05:05]
big blind right and then you're in the

[05:05]
big blind right and then you're in the
big blind and you can check raise. Um

[05:09]
big blind and you can check raise. Um

[05:09]
big blind and you can check raise. Um
now the check raise frequency is going

[05:10]
now the check raise frequency is going

[05:10]
now the check raise frequency is going
to be impacted by many things but one of

to be impacted by many things but one of
the thing that impacts it pretty u

[05:15]
the thing that impacts it pretty u

[05:16]
the thing that impacts it pretty u
widely is how much after you check raise

[05:19]
widely is how much after you check raise

[05:20]
widely is how much after you check raise
your opponent will three bet. So

[05:21]
your opponent will three bet. So

[05:22]
your opponent will three bet. So
essentially sometimes they just have to

[05:24]
essentially sometimes they just have to

[05:24]
essentially sometimes they just have to
let's say they see a two big blind you

[05:26]
let's say they see a two big blind you

[05:26]
let's say they see a two big blind you
check raise six big blind and they have

[05:27]
check raise six big blind and they have

[05:27]
check raise six big blind and they have
to show 40 bigs you know with over pairs

[05:30]
to show 40 bigs you know with over pairs

[05:30]
to show 40 bigs you know with over pairs
with top pairs and a few bluffs and that

realistically that doesn't happen very

you node lock to 8% or 7% and then

[05:53]
you node lock to 8% or 7% and then

[05:53]
you node lock to 8% or 7% and then
suddenly you can check raise maybe twice

[05:55]
suddenly you can check raise maybe twice

[05:55]
suddenly you can check raise maybe twice

I would not have him three bet the flop,
right? So, I imagine, okay, well, if if

[06:41]
right? So, I imagine, okay, well, if if

[06:41]
right? So, I imagine, okay, well, if if
he if he if if I don't allow him to

[06:44]
he if he if if I don't allow him to

[06:44]
he if he if if I don't allow him to
three bet the flop, I should probably

[06:45]
three bet the flop, I should probably

[06:45]
three bet the flop, I should probably
just always raise, right? because he

[06:47]
just always raise, right? because he

[06:47]
just always raise, right? because he
cannot free bet. And then I was playing

[06:49]
cannot free bet. And then I was playing

[06:49]
cannot free bet. And then I was playing
around with the solver and I was like,

[06:51]
around with the solver and I was like,

[06:51]
around with the solver and I was like,
"Hey, he's not raising that much. I

[06:53]
"Hey, he's not raising that much. I

[06:53]
"Hey, he's not raising that much. I
would have imagined what's going on."

[06:54]
would have imagined what's going on."

[06:54]
would have imagined what's going on."
And then I figured out that the solver,

[06:57]
And then I figured out that the solver,

[06:57]
And then I figured out that the solver,
as smart as he is, he

[06:59]
as smart as he is, he

[06:59]
as smart as he is, he
pre-app he he he adapted. He was like,

[07:01]
pre-app he he he adapted. He was like,

[07:02]
pre-app he he he adapted. He was like,
"Okay, I cannot throw at the flop.

[07:03]
"Okay, I cannot throw at the flop.

[07:03]
"Okay, I cannot throw at the flop.
However, I can call your race." And then

[07:05]
However, I can call your race." And then

[07:05]
However, I can call your race." And then
suddenly on the turn, he had like a 50

[07:07]
suddenly on the turn, he had like a 50

[07:07]
suddenly on the turn, he had like a 50
to 60% dunking range. Like, exactly.

[07:10]
to 60% dunking range. Like, exactly.

what you have to put work in.

[09:18]
what you have to put work in.

[09:18]
what you have to put work in.
Yes. Uh I do either that or what I've

[09:21]
Yes. Uh I do either that or what I've

[09:21]
Yes. Uh I do either that or what I've
done for example we did a map with a

[09:24]
done for example we did a map with a

[09:24]
done for example we did a map with a
friend Kenny Hollard. Um we did a map of

[09:29]
friend Kenny Hollard. Um we did a map of

[09:29]
friend Kenny Hollard. Um we did a map of
what nodes impact the win rate and in in

[09:32]
what nodes impact the win rate and in in

[09:32]
what nodes impact the win rate and in in
in uh which fashion. So basically we had

[09:37]
in uh which fashion. So basically we had

[09:37]
in uh which fashion. So basically we had
three bet pots, PVB, single race pot,

[09:39]
three bet pots, PVB, single race pot,

[09:39]
three bet pots, PVB, single race pot,
you know, everything you can think of.

[09:41]
you know, everything you can think of.

[09:41]
you know, everything you can think of.
And then we took a big database and we

[09:44]
And then we took a big database and we

[09:44]
And then we took a big database and we
kind of looked, okay, three bet pots,

[09:47]
kind of looked, okay, three bet pots,

[09:47]
kind of looked, okay, three bet pots,
they involve that many big blind, you

[09:50]
they involve that many big blind, you

[09:50]
they involve that many big blind, you
know, over time, uh BVB, that many big

[09:53]
know, over time, uh BVB, that many big

[09:53]
know, over time, uh BVB, that many big
blind on the flop for like, etc., etc.

[09:56]
blind on the flop for like, etc., etc.

[09:56]
blind on the flop for like, etc., etc.
Uh and then you cross that with the

[09:58]
Uh and then you cross that with the

[09:58]
Uh and then you cross that with the
frequency of the spot, right? Single

[10:00]
frequency of the spot, right? Single

[10:00]
frequency of the spot, right? Single
race spot, small parts but very frequent

[10:03]
race spot, small parts but very frequent

[10:03]
race spot, small parts but very frequent
blah blah blah. We crossed everything

[10:04]
blah blah blah. We crossed everything

[10:04]
blah blah blah. We crossed everything
and the answer was basically how much

[10:07]
and the answer was basically how much

[10:07]
and the answer was basically how much
does that node impact your win rate. Is

[10:08]
does that node impact your win rate. Is

[10:08]
does that node impact your win rate. Is
it a lot? Is it medium? Is it not at

[10:11]
it a lot? Is it medium? Is it not at

[10:11]
it a lot? Is it medium? Is it not at
all? Like I mentioned six big pots. The

[10:13]
all? Like I mentioned six big pots. The

[10:13]
all? Like I mentioned six big pots. The
pots are giant but it never happens. So

[10:15]
pots are giant but it never happens. So

[10:15]
pots are giant but it never happens. So
it doesn't impact your win rate at all.

[10:16]
it doesn't impact your win rate at all.

[10:16]
it doesn't impact your win rate at all.
Right? And so basically we did that and

[10:18]
Right? And so basically we did that and

[10:18]
Right? And so basically we did that and
then we just I just prioritize. Okay,

[10:20]
then we just I just prioritize. Okay,

[10:20]
then we just I just prioritize. Okay,
I'm just going to tackle what impacts my

[10:23]
I'm just going to tackle what impacts my

[10:23]
I'm just going to tackle what impacts my
win rate the most. That's where I want

[10:25]
win rate the most. That's where I want

[10:25]
win rate the most. That's where I want
to get really good. Then I went second

[15:03]
zoom out is the biggest icing pressure

[15:03]
zoom out is the biggest icing pressure
you have on yourself. So the biggest

we have a tight range, we can have big

those textures where the nuts is going

those textures where the nuts is going

And that's usually because there's

And that's usually because there's
something else in intuition, right? Your

something else in intuition, right? Your

something else in intuition, right? Your
intuition is telling you one or the

intuition is telling you one or the

intuition is telling you one or the
other. And then a fear is telling you

[49:59]
other. And then a fear is telling you

[49:59]
other. And then a fear is telling you
the opposite. So maybe your intuition

[50:02]
the opposite. So maybe your intuition

[50:02]
the opposite. So maybe your intuition
tells you it's a bluff. Uh like it's so

[50:06]
tells you it's a bluff. Uh like it's so

[50:06]
tells you it's a bluff. Uh like it's so
easy to overbluff. You know it it's hard

[50:08]
easy to overbluff. You know it it's hard

[50:08]
easy to overbluff. You know it it's hard
to value bet. But then your fear is

[50:11]
to value bet. But then your fear is

to value bet. But then your fear is
telling you it's 17 left in that 10k.

[50:14]
telling you it's 17 left in that 10k.

like trial and failure. Um I had to fail

[50:43]
like trial and failure. Um I had to fail

[50:43]
like trial and failure. Um I had to fail
many times and I had to question like

[50:47]
many times and I had to question like

[50:47]
many times and I had to question like
you know I had that feeling many times

[50:49]
you know I had that feeling many times

[50:49]
you know I had that feeling many times
like I knew what I had to do and I

[50:51]
like I knew what I had to do and I

[50:52]
like I knew what I had to do and I
didn't do it. Why is that? How can it be

[50:54]
didn't do it. Why is that? How can it be

[50:54]
didn't do it. Why is that? How can it be
possible that that I know what is the

[50:56]
possible that that I know what is the

[50:56]
possible that that I know what is the
best play and I don't do it? What

[50:58]
best play and I don't do it? What

[50:58]
best play and I don't do it? What
happened there? It's not logical. And no

[51:00]
happened there? It's not logical. And no

happened there? It's not logical. And no
it's not it's not rational. It's

[51:02]
it's not it's not rational. It's

[51:02]
it's not it's not rational. It's
emotional. And so I made the mistakes

[51:05]
emotional. And so I made the mistakes

[51:05]
emotional. And so I made the mistakes
many times and then eventually I

[51:07]
many times and then eventually I

[51:07]
many times and then eventually I
understood okay I have to perform

[51:10]
understood okay I have to perform

[51:10]
understood okay I have to perform
emotionally really at my best in order

[51:12]
emotionally really at my best in order

[51:12]
emotionally really at my best in order
to apply all that work that I do in the

[51:20]
world and you cannot apply it because of

[1:03:18]
have a tendency. So re for you when

[1:03:18]
have a tendency. So re for you when
you're on a downswing, your tendency,

[1:03:19]
you're on a downswing, your tendency,

[1:03:19]
you're on a downswing, your tendency,
your fear tendency is to go, "Oh, let's

[1:03:22]
your fear tendency is to go, "Oh, let's

[1:03:22]
your fear tendency is to go, "Oh, let's
fall. Let's be more passive." So we can

[1:03:23]
fall. Let's be more passive." So we can

[1:03:23]
fall. Let's be more passive." So we can
see the voice of fear for you is leading

[1:03:26]
see the voice of fear for you is leading

[1:03:26]
see the voice of fear for you is leading
to a tendency of being more passive. For

that is more likely going to be right,

the intuition voice, but there's a high

risk of mistakes. I've got to trust it.

[1:04:04]
risk of mistakes. I've got to trust it.

[1:04:04]
risk of mistakes. I've got to trust it.
I'm going to make mistakes. Then there's

[1:04:05]
I'm going to make mistakes. Then there's

[1:04:05]
I'm going to make mistakes. Then there's
another voice going, don't do that.

[1:04:07]
another voice going, don't do that.

[1:04:07]
another voice going, don't do that.
Don't do that. And the fear voice is

[1:04:09]
Don't do that. And the fear voice is

[1:04:09]
Don't do that. And the fear voice is
always like a protective voice. And

[1:04:10]
always like a protective voice. And

[1:04:10]
always like a protective voice. And
protective voice always sounds

[1:04:12]
protective voice always sounds

[1:04:12]
protective voice always sounds
reasonable. It's like, oh yeah, I don't

[1:04:13]
reasonable. It's like, oh yeah, I don't

[1:04:13]
reasonable. It's like, oh yeah, I don't
want to risk it. this is this sounds

[1:04:15]
want to risk it. this is this sounds

[1:04:15]
want to risk it. this is this sounds
dangerous. I'll just do the fear one. So

[1:04:17]
dangerous. I'll just do the fear one. So

[1:04:17]
dangerous. I'll just do the fear one. So
we end up like defaulting to the fear

[1:04:19]
we end up like defaulting to the fear

[1:04:19]
we end up like defaulting to the fear
voice very often. So we need to

[1:04:21]
voice very often. So we need to

understand ourselves and then we need to

[1:04:22]
understand ourselves and then we need to

understand ourselves and then we need to
be brave enough to override that. So to

[1:04:25]
be brave enough to override that. So to

[1:04:25]
be brave enough to override that. So to
go with our gut. So as Thomas mentioned

[1:04:27]
go with our gut. So as Thomas mentioned

then you also have to do the right

then you also have to do the right

I'm going to learn to trust my

and you're going to be like, oh [ __ ] I

of the intuition. So, how do you deal

[1:08:59]
of the intuition. So, how do you deal

[1:08:59]
of the intuition. So, how do you deal
with those? Hm. Well, um I'm not sure if

[1:09:02]
with those? Hm. Well, um I'm not sure if

[1:09:02]
with those? Hm. Well, um I'm not sure if
I had to

[1:09:04]
I had to

[1:09:04]
I had to
work for that

[1:09:06]
work for that

[1:09:06]
work for that
uh so that those mistake would be less

[1:09:08]
uh so that those mistake would be less

[1:09:08]
uh so that those mistake would be less
painful, but naturally they just feel

[1:09:10]
painful, but naturally they just feel

painful, but naturally they just feel
much better. Like if I'm doing something

[1:09:14]
much better. Like if I'm doing something

because I just didn't know uh that that
was the solution or

[1:09:20]
was the solution or

you know, I'm pretty sure he's bluffing

[1:09:25]
you know, I'm pretty sure he's bluffing

you know, I'm pretty sure he's bluffing
and he's gonna over bluffing and then he

[1:09:27]
and he's gonna over bluffing and then he

[1:09:27]
and he's gonna over bluffing and then he
end up not bluffing. I mean, maybe I'm

[1:09:31]
end up not bluffing. I mean, maybe I'm

[1:09:31]
end up not bluffing. I mean, maybe I'm
still right. So, when I do those

[1:09:33]
still right. So, when I do those

[1:09:33]
still right. So, when I do those
mistakes, somehow it

[1:09:35]
mistakes, somehow it

that they then go out and they think,

a baseline so he didn't have to think

a baseline so he didn't have to think

what this baseline strategy allows you

what this baseline strategy allows you

what this baseline strategy allows you
