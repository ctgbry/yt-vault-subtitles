oh
this is why you float the eight nine
guys
gotta look ahead in the future and they
see this [ __ ] coming
[Music]
the launch is finally there our poker
ambition academy is now live with our
more advanced products like the
mechanics of poker and monster classes
we were aiming for the mid to high
stakes players well i'm very much aware
that the majority of you are going to be
playing a little bit lower stakes and
for that we have now provided the poker
ambition academy go over to our
sitepokermission.com to find out more
what's up guys
how are you all
doing and welcome
to another episode of the wacko show
as i quickly sit down at
a table here and a table here
we at least have two tables straight off
the bat which is
this table right here with our good
friends betcha max strauss and soy mi mi
mami si habla espanol sienas problemas
si claro
and uh our good friends at 88 poker also
provided us with a little table of 5 10
yes the goat thousand enough for the
[ __ ] boys
exactly here we go moto board
i remember
i remember uh every time i see a
motorboat i remember that although in
the beginning when i started to work
together with explode and poker gluca
we divided the flops
for people to to study and then we would
share our experience this way you can
show also the importance of working with
the team right this way we can
cover more ground quicker and it was
explode we had like an ace high monitor
flop and he came with all kinds of kinds
of concepts and we were like great next
time the flop is ace high and mono you
know what to do
which obviously
it's going to be quite unfrequent
that was quite funny every time when i
see a monotone flop
i have to think of mr explode
if you don't want to do on the monitor
flop ask explode that's kind of
what i didn't think
but we got a little
2k l action for the boys
for the fans
i know you guys are fans of the 2k and l
streets
hey boss good luck good luck
awesome content thank you very much sir
for the pot i decided to start with a
check with ace king
face a bet i think
i'm just going to rip it in
yes i think that's a good play
because we're tense
we beat nothing
how can we bank nothing
back door straight draw back door flush
draw two overs
you have to be joking i mean
and trying not to be negative but god
damn [ __ ] [ __ ] meow ross playing
some heads up poker which is our
specialty guys
when we flop top pair with a flush draw
then it's uh it's only our specialty
he checks
and i think i'm just going to start off
with a little bit
i also decided to check here with the
queen 10
don't want to face a check raise
i think this is a good flush rod to
check
as we have the pair together to go along
with it
checks
i'm gonna bet the river and get a call
from king six
let's start with a call
check this flop which
should probably do
so again so far
so far so reggie
goes for a block
okay i done it doesn't really seem like
a recreational to me so far
interesting river
checks
and embed the rear
and he folds
it doesn't reload which is usually a
tell again of a recreational so we are a
little bit confused
face a little seabed here or a little
three-quarters decide to go for a small
check race which is something i'm gonna
do with a low frequency i think the jack
of hearts is good we could mix in maybe
some ace 10.
face mim race okay now this starts to
get a little bit fishy
facing a mim race
this is not a thing
yeah so actually he also joined an outer
table and that they was not
not filling
but that's uh
quite interesting in terms of how people
see him i'm gonna check here with the
queen six basically i only open queen
six suited
which basically means that
and this one actually can go either way
but i usually like small bet in this
kind of scenarios
but it's definitely a spot where you
could also mix in bigger sizings
actually i think i'm gonna check the
river with this combo
and attack the hand to check it out
later
definitely gonna have some check also on
the river
especially if i have
a hand like
i'll leave this table let's say i have a
hand like
1080 or something or jack
8. check it but especially the 10 10 7
10 jack 10 8. definitely hands i'm going
to be check calling on it on the river
king 10 also a hand that i could play
this way that cannot check all the river
i think king jack do you need help
explaining what the hell goes on in
these videos well then poker ambition is
the place to go to re-offer various
servers for various levels of players go
over to our sitepokermission.com to find
out more
it's true there with the pocket tense
easy column
flop i think again easy call
it's an interesting board in terms of
how it plays but i think tense is
probably just still calling
maybe even mixing in a race some of the
time
probably that's more reserved for ninth
but i wouldn't be surprised if that's
going to be in there with a certain
frequency
this is an interesting spot also for him
on the turn in terms of how to construct
his range
curious what it's going to do
checks okay
it doesn't have that he doesn't have
that
blocking is probably the way to go
another one of these motor boards
ask explode
they know what to do
actually it wasn't more it wasn't the
ace broadway axe it was a a slow low
ace dude ace deuce three
mono boards take a look at those those
play quite quite quite an interesting
way is it 32 it's quite big for a mono
board
i guess i'm forced to call one but
this is kind of the thing right with
motorboats you're already not that happy
bad turn obviously snapchat interesting
and i think we have a check fold on the
river when the jackets
she can i've made
queen jack gonna make king ten
let's say it does over c-bat
they showed up with the pocket sevens
finally some green
you know what
you know what green means right there's
a green tag that's mean there's green to
be one
see that here again a little bit on the
bigger side but alright
we'll take it
there's a barrel
easy gogen
and easy go on the river
tough spot for him if he has
ace queen
now i just hope he doesn't have 10 jack
he does have 10 jack how does he have 10
jack
interesting actually then he decided to
bet the river
can i even play in this game i mean what
the [ __ ] they find oh i mean what the
funky float here with the 89
but i floated so that if the six or
seven comes i have a very good bluff he
continues betting
let's represent the straight not having
it oh
this is why you float the eight nine
guys
gonna look ahead in the future and they
see this [ __ ] coming
this is probably an over bet now on the
river
having the 10
and we're gonna over bet the eight nine
and he did fold so that means it was a
incredibly strong and aggressive exactly
exactly my friend
feel the power
baby
and he had a set
we drew out of the scent guys he's gonna
be like huh eight nine that's because i
look into the future and i feel good
i feel good what's safer and less
gambling poker crypt that kind of
depends on your skill my friend
i guess depends on your skill in both
like don't ask me much about crypto okay
i bought a little bit
purely out of fomo
pocket aids
yeah i played this and bad
oh no wait i played like a [ __ ]
genius
