last year was one of the worst down
swings of your life yeah it was a big
down swing in terms of like how big of
our percentage of my my network I lost
it was over
half today we will be chatting with
Argentinian highx cash player Mato urav
Kaya better Known as Sheila online
whatever times it takes to recover like
I think you are going to make it that I
think you think the same about me
Matteo's big dream was to become a
professional basketball player but after
that seemed unnotable he Tred IED into
poker Mel Geor Your Role Model cuz he's
got this kind of fiery nature to him now
you're playing poker and you've got this
aggression in you this want to kind of
kill the opposition but you realize that
always say I need to use this
differently so how are you uh directing
that differently at the PO tables I mean
you have to try to think more
strategically I think Michael Jordan
made a pretty bad Gambler we probably
made up really bad po player it only
took Mato three years to reach high
stakes and he's been one of the bigger
winnings over the past year the people
that really want it will get there Mato
loves the competition which we see back
in his game selection often being very
active in the three and four-handed
battles online it's going to sound
stupid but I I I I saw the best players
like I don't know why there I would like
to see some they sit with this guy and
you know try and and beat him you know
that was my my goal from from the
beginning how are you problem solving
all right I'm slightly Behind These Guys
right now but I'm going to catch up we
are humans you can usually see someone
making a mistake even they're really
good so you can chew on that and feel
like did she's human [ __ ] him right I
can makebe be what do you think are like
the ups and downside of then simplifying
your strategy I think simp simplifying
is is still like really good you spend
much less of your brain frequency or
like the amount of your brain power but
you only have like One Direction which
is bit more often or less often like if
you bet one SI but if you have a lot of
complex stuff you go in in very
different dimensions and you're thinking
about how should I exploit the w you
only have un exploitable unex
who before we dive into today's episode

poker Journey started during the
pandemic so pretty recently actually I
guess like many people in the world you
were locked in doors with nothing else
to do than play online poker I was
wondering did did you have a job at the
time were you studying and why did you
decide to transition into playing poker
full
time well actually I um I the way I got
got into po it was pretty funny I I
remember it was like maybe six months
before the pandemic uh I watched like a
guy that I met like back in the day like
maybe from my primary school like when
we were like 8 years old and he on
Instagram and he was playing poker live
and a casino like this guy wasn't very
brilliant back in the day like we so I I
I used to like poker when I was young
like watch the US so and stuff so I so I
tried my Lu at the casino maybe a couple
of months before and I started going
regularly um and then when and then I
met some some online guys there once I
don't know why or how but we went for
dinner and they were playing like I
don't know 100l or 200l online and they
told me how
you know now if you really like the game
you have to playline you have to play so
they planted the
seed into me so I I I already thought
well I would like to try that and then
basically with the pandemic I I I was
forced to uh so yeah I mean I I was
starting at the time for my yeah my my
University uh so I did both like six
months and then in the pandemic it was
much easier to do both at the same time
because like all the classes all the
lessons of the University were online so
I I did both uh and yeah that's where I
started my
online career if you will it's very
common that you hear uh players talk
about you know they were studying but
then they were also playing poker on the
side and whenever they put it effort
into poker studying would suffer and
when they would put effort into study
poker would suffer you experien
something similar I know that you you're
still doing the university right which
is you know big props you're you're
doing the both things at the same time I
mean I'm not I'm not doing anything at
the moment I just have like a final
project a thesis if you will that's I
still have to do before I get my my my
degree all the other stuff I've finished
um but I've I've been like putting that
or in the to-do list for like a couple
like half one year and a half or so uh
just because I don't it won't change my
life or anything but it's just a
milestone and I already started for so
long and I really like the the career
anyways it's not like I regret it
um but but
yeah back in the pandemic what did you
study for for for the audience
electronic
engineering yeah in the in the
University here of ARA which is pretty
pretty damn good um and yeah but but it
is really it really helped me with
understanding some stuff about Po and I
I always liked that math and that stuff
so so it yeah but yeah of course when I
was when I first started playing poker I
just didn't like if I didn't care very
much about University I was just like
something I did because I had to kind of
but like yeah could you maybe give an
example you said that uh like studying
electronic engineering helped you
understand poker in a bit way did you
may have an
example yes um a lot of the probability
stuff uh really makes sense um all of
the really mathematical aspect of Poker
um yeah understanding the
the distribution of how you model the
the the hands and the win rate and all
that stuff I I really had the theory of
that and I knew that beforehand I had
studied that previously so and also I
think um when you go to these
universities or or when you study like a
very math oriented career or like
they teach you to be very logic in how
your thought process like you receive a
problem you're like well I have this
data whatever um and usually logic
people are drawn to those to those uh
careers as well so I think it reinforces
a way of thinking and and that is kind
of useful for poker you know uh because
I I you still I still have friends and
there are some people that are like in
intuitive or like uh I don't know you're
playing a game and they they roll a dice
and it goes really high and they you
know they they're not thinking about
probabilities in their whole life and I
was like that beforehand you know like I
don't
know like have you ever played like
settlers of Katan for example that board
game dude there was exactly something
that that that popped up in my might
where you said it go go on yeah like I I
have a friend like he will put like the
settlement in the number 12 or like the
most unlikely rooll of TI because he
just feels it and like you know I I
would never be like of course after
poker you just you would not allow
yourself to do that right but like even
before I would never do that either
because I was thinking about this is
doesn't work right so I think yeah I
think the university and all the like
sometimes math theory that you don't
really apply because you're not really a
mathematician in the end when when you
study engineering but those all all of
those like uh mathematical um stuff
helps you build your your your logic I
think your thought process so I think
that that was really useful so I don't
regret it even I'm I'm not planning on
use it at the moment but yeah it's so
funny right we're used to we're so used
to thinking in that way that especially
when you play in the status of Katon
they're like okay well you can put it on
six or eight which is the highest you
know probability number but then they're
like yeah well I played less time and I
had six and it just never came always
fell on four so today I'm going to build
my settlement on four or they have like
a great spot with love resources on six
and eight for example maybe combined
even but they're going to upgrade their
their other settlement to a city because
six and eight are not falling you know
yeah exactly yeah Jack Jack for is my
favorite hand that's exactly and like
it's funny because I play I play with my
wife quite a lot and some I get a bit
tilted like I've explained this a
million times like are you really gonna
think like a fish but she keeps on
thinking like a fish it's really
interesting um in terms of uh other like
obviously there was the The Logical
logical thinking that resonated really
well with with poker what else attracted
you to poker in the beginning and I'm
also curious like what keeps you
interested in the game up until
today um I think
it's the at the beginning I think it was
a competitive aspect for sure like like
competing but I would say I and I have
to be honest like At first also whenever
when you're a broke kid like or you
don't have a lot of money also the money
kind of attracts you at first that's
just how it is right like being able to
to play a game and and you read that oh
you can make money if you study whatever
that that's also attractive um and it
feels like much less of a work much less
work than other jobs yeah and you met
these guys right that were playing 100
and 200 now I think you mentioned they
probably mentioned like some numbers
that they were making I know you're
you're from Argentina so if you make
dollars you know and you spend it in PES
of my mind yeah yeah yeah always yeah
exactly and I don't think they told me
exactly how much they were making but
they were saying how yeah they basically
I
was like have been going for like few
months to a casino and like whatever you
can make there or like the level you see
that it was very very
like you didn't see the world like you
don't you cannot Aspire like when you go
when you switch to online and you see
the Panorama you see like oh there's
this guys playing in a table of like No
Limit 40K you know and imagine how much
money they have and then you know so it
kind of broadens your spectrum of like
oh you I can be this and I don't have to
like root to be like the best play in my
card room and and you know so I think I
kind of like yeah that's what what
happened a little bit so thankful
thankful to them
here what is about the competing you
mentioned you really like the
competitive aspect about poker what is
it about competing that really attracts
you like how does competition make you
feel that that that that it draws you
towards
it
um I don't know I just I just like
winning I don't know like even since I
was a kid I always maybe it's because I
don't know like I always loved winning
hated losing and sometimes to the point
of like not the healthiest level I would
say
um but yeah and since I I I played
basketball my whole life was I was a kid
I was very passionate about that and and
really wanted to make it there at the
beginning was my plan um I think the
competitive was like a given right I
would not have been myself if I wasn't
as competitive I just applied it to
Poker although maybe it's a little bit
different but like yeah that initially
like being able to outplay
someone it's yeah that's where the fun
the most fun aspect of it of it I
think they have ability to outplay some
really it's it's a nice boost I I I get
it like especially you know I obviously
play poker way way longer I I started
way before you started uh especially in
the beginning when you didn't have like
solver strategies and it was basically
all the decisions were more exploitative
so you could take way more credit in
winning where now for example if you
just execute a solid strategy it's
almost like you take a little bit less
credit you also find like if you if you
make a nice exploit those are the most
the most satisfying instead of like oh
he just walks into my strategy that you
know you know there's no much you can do
but when I really push someone into a
corner and he does exactly what I wanted
him to do and I was one step ahead
that's when it's most satisfied yeah or
like maybe when you back in the day with
no solers and stuff like when you like
start using a certain sizing in texture
and then after one year everyone uses
the sizing and maybe you can feel like
well you know they maybe they didn't C I
was right before and they you know so
you can feel all of that and that's
probably very nice and I I really think
I would would have had all fun in the
prear era to be honest but yeah I I
don't know like it's possible to check
you mentioned the that sometimes your
competitiveness left uh would reach a
level that was maybe not considered very
healthy you maybe have an example that
stands
out from from my childhood I don't know
like because I always all my Idols
growing up like basketball players I
always loved the fact that they were
like all the like I thought it was a
good thing right like being relentless
or being like like competive to to to
the point of being like so I I thought
that was like the positive aspect like I
my favorite player was Michael
Jordan of basketball growing up and even
though he was super talented and like I
I think the the the thing I could
compare at least to him more because I
have you know I couldn't jab like g i
but like I wasn't as tall but like the
thing I could compare or like try to
replicate was like the the viciousness
the competitiv I remember once I I read
a story about the guy and they were like
they had they were doing this trip with
all the Chicago Bulls their team and the
guy who was also a little bit of a
gambler I think and that that shows in
the latest like Last Dance
uh serious but like he basically bets
all of his friends like you know what my
luggage will come up first of the you
know luggage thing and then he goes and
pays $50 to the to the guys at the plane
and has his luggage go first and it's
only to win I don't know the guys is
making a million dollars per per year
and he just wants to like hustle their
friends for 100 bucks you know and that
the fact that he wants to be like this
guy he says he you know he wants to
demonstrate he's the like that mindset I
think it's fabulous and I think but it's
a little bit you know sick in the mind
but I think that that's is just power
and I'll hear all those stories I was
like w I think that's the way that's the
way you got to be in life so yeah how
did you apply like that that mindset to
poker for example I can imagine if
you're very competitive like do you have
like enemies at the table do you take
things very
personally um I don't think yeah I used
to maybe more back in in when I started
uh but I still yeah I
mean
that's yeah I think I I I I do I do I I
do take things personally or like if I
see someone doing something that I don't
think is correct or I could exploit I
okay let's let's bring it um but I think
since poker is like more of a long-term
game you don't see the immediate game so
you have to be careful on your mind it's
not as quick to process that so you have
to like put your competitive aspect more
into like a calm down spot right because
even though if you think you're better
you don't know but even if you are
you're not going to win like it's not
chess right you're not going to win
every hand or whatever so uh but yeah
it especially when I started and you
started like having this these rivalries
when you're playing online you have this
rivalries versus some breaks you're
playing 50nl and you see always that you
know creation rig that you know he's
crazy and have notes and I would yeah I
would go crazy I would love that that
was that was why I played that for sure
at the beginning yeah do you take uh do
you take countries personal as well you
mentioned creation any any any specific
countries that that that you have more
of a more of a hate relationship which
you're like oh there there's another
Brazilian I know you're Argentinian you
know you guys Argentina Brazil very
competitive do also show at the PO
tables no I don't think I don't think
there's like I think um you don't check
country before you
call I do I do sometimes uh especially
from it's I think it's more more
important for recreational I think to to
check like the country uh but I think
yeah I just popped it just popped one
country in my mind because I remember
there was like this
R when I started playing GG I think
Russian cash I remember it was a
Croatian R and sometimes amazing when
you when you see the same breaks you
were playing uh and they're still like
playing this you know sort of the
similar Stakes that you were playing
back then it's kind of St like you see
the same screen name of course I don't
remember right now but like but yeah
um you mentioned that uh basketball was
basically uh the thing that motivated
you the most especially in the beginning
you were trying to try and become Pro in
the end um you said that you kind of
realized you probably not good enough to
make it as a professional basketball
player so that dream was maybe sort of
gone how did you take that realization
did it have any like impact on your
confidence your self-belief maybe also
going into poker like well it wasn't
like first of all it's not that I'm not
good enough
uh because I I I did get to be like a
semi-professional I got paid for it but
it was like the third Le and it was just
not not like not good enough for for
what I expected for myself so I decided
okay it's like I would not would I would
have to have lived a very frugal and not
comfortable life uh maybe if I wanted to
be a pro and and I would have like and
then after maybe at 35 years old I would
be like now what now what do I do I have
like1 1K doll saved to my name uh so I
would have be able to done to do it but
it just wasn't you know I don't know
some things happened and I I kind of
like lost the passion for one or two
years and then I transition and I found
this this poker thing so it it told me
to like put all the the the passion that
I all the fire that that we as a person
have into something else and that also
helped me transition um so yeah I didn't
like I didn't take it I wasn't sad or
anything it was just I just moved on and
I I still love the game and then after
the pandemic which I which I didn't do
anything after that I I came back and
now I'm playing and I have like and I
train and and I do have like I want to
become a little bit better than I am but
just with another like more of a hobby
mindset
uh but beforehand it was like more like
I want to make it but like I think also
once you start playing like I played
that League that was a little bit better
than I usually played and you see like
how other people play you also get put
more in your place and in and you you
know get more real with yourself in how
long or how high can you go and I
realized I was capped and you know and
and it's fine because in terms of
percentile wise I was like I was usually
much better than than the other people
but in terms of absolute like I would
never like be really good I would never
get to the first division of Argentina
even which is not that bad like yeah so
when I saw that I was like okay it's
time to do something else um and I was
fine with it yeah was not hard at
all yeah you you then started to focus
more on poker when did you start
experiencing like your first successes
in
poker
[Music]
um I I think I I focused in University
for a couple of months but then I found
poker so the University Central the part
of the university in the central part of
my life lasted really low um and and I
think I had like a couple of months
playing live which I was like basically
a fish and I and and then I started like
reading I was I think I was just smart
enough to realize that I should not
listen to people in the casino what
they're talking about and just study
elsewhere so I started and unfortunately
I started reading I know Jonathan little
books or whatever like but like at least
I was like finding out for myself So
eventually I got to better content and
then I improved I think I had like one
or two months of winning a decent amount
of money just before the pandemic which
of course that doesn't mean I was
enjoying success because life poger it
just the Baran is insane uh and I think
that first year of 2020 I was like very
swingy and I think I was I I started
paying for everything and like becoming
a pro the next year so I would say 2021
was the first year where I I I you know
took a stride like I I I I enjoy success
if you will the first one year was very
very bumpy I think
when you experience like these bumps on
the road I I I don't think like
obviously in basketball it's more like
you you play a good game and you get
rewarded for it poker is very very much
the opposite you can play very well but
you know the swings will be there that
didn't discourage you from uh from
pursuing pursuing poker how did you how
did you handle handle the fact that
poker had so much
swings
um it's so hard because
hey yeah I don't know it's just I think
I was doing so much poker and I had so
much love for the game just from the get
go that I didn't even care like first of
all I would just play so of so much like
maybe I would do like 12 hours day of
Poker and maybe I played six or eight
hours and then the rest I was be
studying playing watching videos
whatever so H yeah the Baran I mean not
to say that the barans didn't last for
long because I was playing so much but I
don't know I just I just didn't care and
I I it it's funny because like when you
first start and sometimes it happens
nowadays too but like it's hard to know
like whenever you like you know lose 10
Buy in in two or three sessions and it
was Baran uh you still feel like you
play Bad uh and when you're first
starting you cannot separate like you
cannot realize oh I just got cooled
million times what can I do and you just
feel I think I pumped like look at this
oh and then you look at all the hands
and you're like oh the all big pots are
coolers but but your State of Mind feels
like you were like just calling badly in
spots so separating that is hard uh but
I don't know I just The Passion of the
game was bigger than than whatever else
it it threw at me at least at the start
and probably I run well too because like
all the all of the people uh that are
probably here in the podcast run well at
the beginning I think that's just a
given like you it's not if not you will
take much longer it's just what it is
yeah it's it's it's very interesting for
example when I started to play play
poker I remember I went to like a local
type of like pop type of tournament I
believe there were like a 100 Runners
and I shipped it I don't know how
because it was super bad but it m like
you you need you like if you just
straight away go into worst down swing
of your life in like the first 10K you
play you're like this poker thing just
sucks like I don't want to play anymore
so so indeed it's quite interesting in
in the beginning you need to have like
at least some neutral variants but
preferably positive variants in order
for you actually enjoy this game because
no one will enjoy just getting cool it
all the time be like this this game
sucks no no for sure like you need to
feel like first like but it's like the
doping like you need to feel oh look I'm
making so much money with this game in
one week I made like I don't know
whatever and then then maybe you lose it
then you just baring but like at Le you
get the feeling of oh you know really
winning and smashing everyone that
that's what the feeling that keeps you
you
know Adam it's sounds like um Mato
straight away from the gecko wasn't
despite the swings weren't there he
didn't give it too much attention it
sounds like he was very process focused
he was just focused on the law for the
game even though the outcome was maybe
not the way he wanted in the short term
it didn't really destroy the love that
he had for the game and like I said he
was just focused on the process how does
one cultivate a mindset like that
especially if it doesn't come
natural well like Mato said like he also
run good so I think wi winning when
you're first new to something is going
to make it feel more enjoyable but over
time it's like learning to uh enjoy the
the skill of playing and the strategy
side of the game more than the outcome
itself and as Mata mentioned it's really
hard to separate those in your first
year when you're losing you feel like
you're the worst player in the world
when you're winning you feel like an
absolute genius and like you're so
linked to your internal State how you
feel is linked to that external result
so it's all well and good go always be
process driven don't just don't voice
the outcomes but your first few years of
pocket you live the the roller coaster
of the ups and downs so yeah I think
obviously we all want to run good in
this in the short term but I think it's
understanding that over the long term
how you show up the process is going toh
take you somewhere but it's going to
take a bit of repetition to realize okay
the external outcomes I'm getting on
matching the efforts I'm putting in on a
daily basis and how do I kind of
separate those two so how can I go right
the external results are over there my
kind of process how I show up is here
how do I focus more my attention on that
so yeah I think it's uh some players can
do it more naturally and they're more
confident in their ability to do that
other players have a lot of self-doubt
when results aren't going their way even
if they got a big sample some players
will struggle with self-doubt when they
have like a bad week or a bad period of
time and they'll they'll use the
external results to validate am I
playing well am I not so yes it's an
ongoing thing but I think it's
definitely uh something you can
cultivate by just doubling down on the
process over and over it's also like
what you want out of it if you need or
you really play it because you want to
win money for example that's I think
when it really becomes a trouble right
because you're not getting what you want
where it sounds like Mato what he wanted
out of it well that that was what poker
was giving him you know adrenaline cool
game something to focus on despite the
swings swings were part of it and I
remember I used to have like a guy that
I that I studed with a lot I I sh shared
an office with and I think that he hated
the most was a break even session he
said listen there needs to be something
happening like I want to win or lose you
know I want to feel something so if you
have kind of that mindset like even even
a losing session kind of gives you what
you want in a weird way does that make
sense yeah I
think break you in that's funny uh yeah
I
think I think yeah it's what Adam said
at the beginning also I just enjoyed
playing very much I just did like it was
something like competing and like
thinking through a hand and like I
remember I I I remember I was playing
888 uh the ZM snap format and I had the
strategy that was like in a three at pot
when I call in position you know like
small button and it was a button I would
just call everything versus flop CIT and
if they check all in like the turn that
was for my strategy and and it worked
and now you can see well you know this
not that bad of a strategy at like 50
andl 25 and and doing that I remember I
was just like looking in consistent
constantly ways to you know try because
my my my my theory knowledge was like
slim to none so I was just like all the
time like thinking about like brain
soling like what can I do I kind of knew
ranges but that that was about it uh so
I think yeah that the Strategic aspect
of the game is what like was really
really enticing and and exciting to like
you know learn a game I always been
always been like that I think uh every
every time I played the game with my
friends and I got my ass handed to be
like I don't know we used to play Mortal
Kombat or we used to play when I was
very small I know Age of Empire whatever
like online game or like video game I
used to play and I got smacked I always
go running to Google and say how do you
play this [ __ ] like and I would like get
into videos play people playing like
really well and I would like read all
the guys I don't know I just had too
much energy trying to become better and
also compete and beat my my Tas friends
so that's you that's what like I think
started
everything that's that Michael Jordan
competitive Spirit coming out I've got a
friend like that who always wants to
beat you with everything someone like
why you trying so hard to beat me at
every single game we play but yeah I
like it it's it's one of those things
where competition itself like is there's
so many positives of it as long as it's
for the right reasons to better yourself
to uh to win the game cuz life's just
one big game that we're all playing and
we choose which ones that are important
but at the end of the day we can yeah
compete at a yeah good level of lots
things if if we want to so I'm really
curious to dive into your story and kind
of start from scratch in terms of you
getting into poker so I want to jump
back into the pandemic on a word level
you're getting into poker everything the
world's going to to shat for a while no
one knows what's going on but online
poker is going really well at least it
looks like oh these games I can play
from my laptop and my bedroom talk us
through like those initial stages of
loading up an account getting started
with poker outside your bedroom's going
wild but how tell me for the initial
stage of starting your pocket
Journey yeah well like I said I I just
got into like Po like online played like
started playing like two weeks ago
before the pandemic like deposited like
know $300 in one site and I started
playing and once everything shuts off
I'm like well I should give is a try a
serious try and I think I if it wasn't
for the pandemic I probably still would
have continue to go to the casino and
that would be very detrimental to my
growth so I think uh this was the best
thing that I could could ever happened
to me also the games were like and also
I have much more free time uh nothing to
do like you said so all the it was all
the conditions set to to like put all
like go all in on poker and I also yeah
I got into a few study groups in Discord
I found the like the two plus two which
were like mostly American so I started
talking about hands every day like
finish the session review hands with
some people or like you know comment on
other people hands and you know I
started all of that process and like I
really enjoyed it h yeah and it was like
a super like Up Up and Down Road my my
backgr management was terrible I was
just didn't you know uh so that that
first year was really terms of that I
was lucky
to to be I don't know how you say I was
yeah I was lucky to end up in the way
that it did because it could have gone a
lot worse uh and I but I learned a lot
and I think I was kind
of decent about like I I always had like
a notebook or some stuff where I would
just write down notes about like I I
have to focus on this stuff like I have
to like I know meditate before every
session I have to stop calling on the
river stop calling and
I yeah I don't know I whatever think I
was stuff I was think whatever think I I
thought I was doing like super bad I
would just try and correct and it's so
hard to correct like some some patterns
but I was trying and I was like trying
to be honest with myself look at my game
okay why did you lose so much this
session well what did you do bad like
right about I don't know
so it was like that and I would I think
to be honest is I think uh you got you
have to go through the phase of like
being really into poker and spending a
lot of time into it I don't think you
can like achieve success if you don't go
through that phase uh maybe you can but
I think yeah all the people I know that
made it or really good really went for
that phase at one point and the pandemic
is just the ideal setup for that to
happen right yeah the conditions were
rigged in your favor for that I agree I
think most players who making a poker
have an obsessive fears and it's out of
that just like curiosity for the game
like this interest that I just want to
solve problems and I can't stop myself
from wanting to play and wanting to
study and learn about the game and that
often sets you up for the future as well
so you mentioned like for you were you
were learning lessons and it sounds like
you being very intentional taking notes
and writing stuff down with any big
breakthroughs you had in your first year
that really kind of set you for that
second year like kind of the lessons
that were like oh that they were
fundamental to my
growth they were a lot I think I I went
broke I mean broke I had to redeposit my
online because my online bank roll went
busto like twice uh but it was like what
maybe 300 $600 Bank rolls but I didn't
have much more money at the time right
so yeah and the last time I think I
deposited I I decided I would not
deposit anymore and that time I never I
never went Pasto um and stuff I learned
I don't know I have like I went I had
like this guy that coached me for like
one month or two months uh but he was
really good and he got me into solvers
so I the first year I was already like
he showed me and that's what the
mathematical or aspect because the guy
was like a computer scientist guy
whatever uh and he was already also
playing and he offered me like a cfp
deal and then I don't know or then some
staking be or whatever but it didn't
last long because I think then the guy
lost some money and had to do something
but I very well but it really helped me
because his coaching sessions he
introduced me to a solver and like like
you know the typical stuff that that you
see like when you're using a Sol right
you like oh it's if I don't let it let
it check race it's just donkey in the
next stream why is that so you get I got
a little bit my hands on that and he
used to give me the the Sims because
back in the day there was no GG wizard
yeah the Sims were like really texting
on your computer and I have a shitty ass
laptop um so I think that guy helped me
um and then also meeting people I think
like getting into an environment where
you where you're talking hands every day
and that way you find some really smart
people you can talk poker about uh I
think that was really helpful I don't
know I think that's that's yeah yes so
it sounds like the first year bit
chaotic learning things on the Fly and
then you get you meet this coach around
the the second year end of the first
year and he Ste in the right direction
with solves and it sounds like for you
that kind of opened up your mind to what
was possible so I'm curious to know like
what kind of games you were playing at
this stage and then what were your kind
of initial goals I know when you first
get into poker it's off like this is
really fun I'm making some money and
then as you're going through the kind of
transitions you're like wait a second
like what can I actually do with this
game where can I get to so in this pH
what were you kind of thinking mindset
wise in terms of what your objectives
were in po um I think I don't remember
well but I think I first started playing
I first started playing like no 10 No
Limit 10 uh and quickly I I like playing
soon because I was like impatient or
whatever I didn't like playing R tables
I had like a small screen so you
couldn't open a lot of them so two
taable in soon was way easier um so I
started playing like I think sum 888 and
then I moved to 50 sum but I wasn't good
enough to beat that but I run well at
the beginning and I remember like having
like going I know from $300 to 1K and
telling my friend friends and they were
like wow man with like withdraw that
like you know buy something with that I
was like no man this this is like the
tool to make more money you know I I but
like I remember that it was it was funny
and but then of course I ended up losing
it uh so it it was a while and then I
decided to play proper like a little bit
more conservative bank roll and I played
TW started playing on GG on 25 and all
and and yeah but as soon as I got to
like 100 or whatever or maybe 200 which
was like down the first year like I
think the the the end of the first year
of 2020 I was ready ready to to shut
take to hell with a decent size bank
roll I think I just realized that in
Argentina at least back back back at
back then when the the dollar and like
the the the currency was so low compared
to the dollar like I quickly realized
and this I remember that like there's a
threshold especially being like a single
person in your 20s with no
responsibilities like tied to you you
have no kids you have no family you have
like very little responsibility um the
the margin utility like the margin of
how much does your life improve by
winning more money what things what
extra things you can afford is just
super super low and what I mean by this
is like if you play 200l 500L 1kl or
100l even in Argentina you're like
lifestyle probably can be the same maybe
yeah of course you can save much more
money or less money so once I realized
that or like assumed that I just I just
didn't care about like I knew my my
lifestyle was wasn't going to change
because the country is very cheap so I
just just focused on winning money in
order to play higher in order to like
compete with stronger players and I had
that very clear I didn't I didn't really
care about the money just because uh
after a SE mistake it just doesn't
matter anymore for me uh and and it felt
that way from the beginning I think all
since I was draun into because of the
competitive stuff I really wanted to and
it's going to sound stupid but I I I saw
the best players like I don't know ler I
like I would like to someone someday sit
with this guy and you know try and and
beat him you know that was my my goal
from from the beginning uh of course you
know it will come a time where you
realize where your ceiling is just like
with happen with to basketall maybe but
you don't have to be delirious and you
know gift your b roll to to the to L or
whatever but like I think that's was
what my like initial goal like I didn't
I didn't really care about much about
making money just just enough to live
okay I
guess yeah that's very interesting
because I think a lot of players would
get to that point and think about it
very differently so you mentioned you
got a 200 NL FC a year and you could
your lifestyle wouldn't change by
playing higher a lot of people might get
conservative around this time going oh
like these things are good like don't
mess things up like this is a good point
where we've done well whereas you like
use that as kind of a leverage to go
right Lifestyles kind of tick that box
that doesn't need to worry about that
anymore and then you say pushed on and
it sounds like your competitive Drive
start to kick in here you looking at lus
and go right let's let's take this guy
down this is you like trying to your
quest to get better so talk us for like
how that how that impacted you in terms
of how you progress from there so you
ATL things are looking good bankroll
wise talk us through like how you went
Racing for the stakes from that
point uh I don't know if I went racing I
think I think that maybe the first year
was the one when I went when I climbed
more Stakes um
but yeah and I I think I
started I remember I think at the
beginning of the year I I I put my a lot
of my roll into Bitcoin for some reason
because I have to withdraw I don't know
why I did that and all of a sudden it
went down so I'm like [ __ ] this I cannot
deposit now in a site right because now
I'm going to lose this whatever
percentage I have to wait until it comes
back up stupid of course stupid uh
thought process but then so then three
weeks I started to like study 10 hours a
day and I really got more into solers
and I really started going more into the
technical side of the game so it kind of
helped me somehow to like become more
like theoretical or like you know study
a little bit more of theory which I was
like not doing the best job so far at
least for R but I was luckily equipped
with the tools uh via watching like
getting into the right content maybe uh
getting into like the right Discord
groups at least at the time to like with
people that were smart enough to like
share good knowledge and I give you
tools to improve so I I started doing
that I actually also remember that you
know one week before the pandemic I one
guy that I made the at the casino just
sold me some courses of a guy and for
super cheap I was like well you you have
like you know $3 or like whatever now
maybe maybe it was more because I'm I'm
thinking about it but yeah maybe it was
like $20 and he sld me a whole package
of courses and and I used them in the
pandemic because I what what do we study
oh let's do this and it was really
helpful and and it was so cheap the RO
was so high but yeah I think in the
second second year I
basically my whole approach changed my
bang roll management got a little bit
Meier uh just because I I had to focus
on other stuff I think looking at what
how you do each session so in in that
regard what you said um kind of change
um just because I I had been a little
bit too Deen to to that point so I
decided it was time to change that and
then I and I was like it was good that I
did that because going into like the
higher you play the more like you don't
want to like swing percentage of your of
your net worth I think and so but yeah
so I started starting
like having more better study routines
knowing a little bit how like what is
what is it that you want to study and
and I believe I was super and some
people may not believe this but like I
was super Theory like I was like a clany
like I was like okay this is this board
you have to use this sizing or the
sizing I was playing like many sizings
and many boards and you have to like do
not you know don't get exploited well it
doesn't matter what they do you know
just play your strategy so I was like
really focused on Theory and like why on
my game that didn't really matter what
everyone else was doing that was at
first and then I sort of like evolved
maybe from that but at the beginning I
was like
super into that kind of like thing you
know
game yeah it's clear that you Rose up
very quickly I know you didn't think
you've raised through the levels that
you you're playing every day it feels
like a slow Journey when you're living
and breathing it but you mentioned in
the question sent you that most people
playing in the post Sol era rise up
relatively quickly these these days and
I'm curious to know why you feel that is
the case why do people who start poker
in the Posta era why do you feel like
they've got a little bit of an edge in
terms of their speed of learning
obviously we can use the tools but why
do you feel like it's being so effective
for you to uh to rise quicker than other
players well I think I don't know it's
just a common Trend that I see like
people it's just I think it's because
like the resources are more face up like
if you want to get better you just just
you just go there uh right so it it just
makes it more uneven in terms of like
the people that really want it will get
there and the people so the already
natural bias of how stuff works uh is
gets increased the level of playing
field just gets even more tilted towards
the people that really want to become
better whereas before maybe the people
that really wanted did not have such a
clear path towards making it so now they
get something surpassed by the labox
that you know had six months the first
six months of his career never ending
win streak and then after that he
decided okay might well might as well
study uh so I think yeah I think with
the information being out there and
which and with what you have to do at
least when you start uh like the amount
of information that is out there
nowadays is just insane so I mean you do
have to select some stuff and you
know you know it's not that easy but I
think the information available makes it
so that if you want to do it and you
want to spend the time it's right there
you just have to like put in the time
and the the effort uh maybe back then
you have to be a little bit more lucky
you know surround yourself surround
yourself but like the the appropriate
people uh you know there's maybe in
order to improve before you had some
more variant right I think now it's
there it's not that's not the case yeah
it was already interesting the way you
said that the players who want to get
ahead now can get ahead quicker because
the path is more clear and the tools and
the direction of what you need to do is
a bit more in in front of you so to
speak whereas in the past it was a bit
more hidden out of sight so it allows
players like yourself are very dedicated
H there's almost like no obstacle it's
like okay how much work can I put into
to get better why do you feel like the
players who are already ahead of you
let's say some players might have 10
year experience when you're just when
you're just starting out why do you feel
like they can't stay ahead of these new
guys like yourself are coming through
quick because they've got the same tools
they've got the same access why if you
like the the Young Guns are coming up
quick I don't know if I think I don't
know if the the Old Pros cannot stay
ahead I I don't think I think some and I
think the the 10-year-old longtime
playing guys have
a how do you say like an advantage over
the new the new generation
that is important to recognize like
you're you are the disadvantage in a
certain point because they have mental
game is probably 10 times better they've
seen whatever [ __ ] you see you seen they
see 10 [ __ ] of that so I mean you have
to be careful uh to thinking that but I
think at least I I can see it being sort
of easy to when if if you're playing the
game for 10 years for 10 years or more
to lose a little bit the passion or like
willingness to get up and like study
three hours about like blind be blind
whatever spot and I think it's I mean
it's only logical because the game is so
like intense on your everything right so
I think it's kind of easy to lose a
little bit of the or like getting more
into like not a competitive like I want
to improve or get into a mindset of like
I just want to be good enough to see at
this table with the wreck and just win
which is of course perfectly respectable
but of course that mindset will not lead
you to become you know 100% the best it
may be the best of in terms of Ari of
your time because you spend X time just
you know polishing your game enough so
you just you can do good well but uh but
yeah I
think I mean it's only logical if you've
been at this game for 10 years you
probably just want to like make the max
amount of money with at least amount of
efforts and just focus on on other stuff
like family you know it's just logical I
don't know
yeah I feel like that when you're on the
climb the hunger is always higher and
then when you're at the certain level
maintainance got less motivation than it
is to kind of climb to that new level
you see it in sports all the time like a
sport like boxing it's much easier to be
the champion rather than to stay the
champion it's only like the the real
goto can kind of Stay Stay The Champ and
even then they often lose to uh an up
and come out just so hungry wants it
more so I think that's obviously
advantage and as you mentioned the
experience of the players who've Just
Seen It All Before Works in their favor
H so they've got like kind of yeah I
think it's very interesting to see the
the kind of battles that go on in terms
of players who are more established and
players who are just trying to make
their way and those coming together the
hunger of the younger guys and the
established experience of the the kind
of the old
guards I hope you guys are enjoying this

progress in your poker
career so you mentioned last year was
one of the worst down swings of your
life I wanted you to relive it for us
and talk us through what happened last
year what was the how about was the down
swing to talk us through how that
impacted you well yeah I think who was
it last year yeah well it was a lot of
stuff a lot of a lot of things actually
um first I I just moved uh to live by
myself I used to live with my mom and I
would have moved earlier but like we had
some [ __ ] going on so I prefer to stay
with her but when I finally did uh that
was the beginning of the down swing so
that's always you know whenever your
living costs increase a little bit uh
and you I wasn't going to feel the
pressure because still it's cheap but
you know you start spending twice as
money mon every month uh I started like
running a little bit bad so that's when
it started and yeah it was a big toing
in terms of like how big of a percentage
of my my netw worth I lost it was over
half and and and it was across multiple
Stakes so it was like the the good old
you drop down and then you still run bad
and you drop down again so I was at the
time I was playing like maybe up to 2K
and all um and I had taken like a mon a
whole month off because I wanted to
study for my finals the last patch of
finals of my career and then I also had
to move so it was like a like what I
completely took time of poer playing at
least uh you always like maybe review a
hand or two but but yeah so when I came
back I decided to take it slow and I was
like okay I'll just play I don't know 1K
for the for the first for the first
couple of sessions just you know to
just just so I don't lose a lot of money
and of course for session play only one
G and then I lost like insane amount of
binds uh and and yeah from that point
onward onwards I just started maybe it
was like
a it's like I think it's like usually
like that on pick down it's like that
first you're doing some stuff wrongly
and when you correct that that you start
running bad so you the reinforcement
like it just just feels like nothing
works but like you're just at first it
was your fault now it's the baran's
fault and at the end you know that's
what happened so maybe I was like my T
selection was complete uh garbage at the
at at the beginning I was playing a lot
of like maybe heads up or like battles
at at the highest take then I took a hit
and then decided to go like okay let's
play lower or let's play more
conservative and then R so it was like
the I know compound
aspect of that and I took some time off
I think I took like three weeks off to
dealing with some other other stuff too
and and then but yeah and in the
end I'm I I'm kind of grateful anyways
for that because it it taught me a lot
um and I I don't mean this like I don't
mean this like I really mean it I think
it's it's just like something you have
to go through uh in order to to improve
uh aspects of your game in that case
maybe my my mine was mental some some
mental stuff was
was bad so so it forced me to improve uh
so I think yeah it was it was a tough
year I think because I think overall I
lost money uh or like well maybe one
very little because of like the expenses
but like I think it really taught me a
little a thing or two um so so yeah I
think I think everyone goes through
through something like that in their
careers I think it's very hard not to
have some something like that happen and
and what I thought right away uh is like
well maybe thanks God this happens when
I was playing maybe like I don't know 2K
now but maybe when I was playing 5K or
10K because you know the the if I have
to play that high to realize I was doing
some stuff wrong and then lose much more
money that would be way more way way
worse at least so I don't
know
that's that's what how I feel about it
um yeah but of course it's
tough yeah it's one of those things that
you've almost got to go through you've
got to experience it to uh to kind of
learn the lessons from that I think it's
really important what you said as well
like the kind of compounded effect of a
downswing it normally starts either
you're playing bad or variance but then
you start they start interfere with each
other I think often the most common way
is variance kicks in first then you
start playing bad then variance on top
and then you can't just play through
that with a sample size because now your
games like deteriorate in week by week
you're starting to get affected by
results maybe you're not pulling
triggers on Rivers maybe you got a bit
of emotion going to your sessions you
know it um pay as much attention as you
know normally would and all of a sudden
like oh that was a variance downwing to
begin with now I'm just playing some B
pocker as well so you mentioned from a
mindset perspective I'm sure like during
this down swing you were wrestling with
loads of ideas and am I good enough and
the self-doubt talk us for like the the
main mental lessons you learned from
this in terms of being able to get
through this because I always feel like
if you're able to overcome adversity
there's a massive lesson packed in that
which sets you for future challenges
someone for you like what was the the
big kind of lesson you learned through
through dealing with d coming out the
side a
bit well first of all like it just humil
humbles you a lot you just drop the ego
a little because you're forced to like
you're not someone who plays XT you're
just some guy right because now so first
you get humbled you realize well always
being a Mor this regard playing these
people uh I think uh yeah I think that's
one of the the main things
um it it teaches you a little bit like
be more strategic about your life and if
you like if you don't feel like swinging
x amount of money just play maybe for
this month play in this way right and
then it doesn't mean you have to play
that that forever uh a good advice I
once heard like I remember I don't know
it was like where but like was like a it
was from you w i i remember you said
something like when you're like just
losing every day don't be afraid to book
win even though it's not ideal in terms
of like because if you have a good
session in the morning and you usually
play two sessions why wouldn't you play
one the afternoon you kind of think like
that would like are you it's like a fish
mentality but when you just lose 15 days
in a row like maybe seeing one green
number on your trucker is kind of good
so if you like maybe get to like uh see
two or three green numbers in a row or
at least next to each other you will
build some momentum in terms so like
sometimes taking the the minus CB or
like the not of like yeah thinking like
a fish like playing only one session
because the first one you want but when
you're in in special circumstances like
being permissive and like and with
yourself of doing that right I think
that's um something that especially it
depends on on the player profile because
some people if they get on downswings
they just play very very infrequently so
it just of course depends on on how your
your approach is if you have a an easy
time playing then playing less sometimes
is good right if you so I think it
depends but I think that that was good
ADV advice and I actually do that
nowadays and I feel no shame in that
anymore whereas before I was I just look
at myself from from outside I would be
like what is that this doesn't even make
sense and then you go into the second
session and lose whatever perfectly
normal bar so you would like deep down
you like a my [ __ ] more and you end
in this Loop of stuff that doesn't even
make sense but like
so I think taking it slow and just
coming slowly back up is a good advice
and I
think um also a friend I remember told
told me when I had this big town swing
he told me you know we we are going to
make it he said like it doesn't matter
if we make it in one year or two this is
just like whatever times it takes to
recover like I think you are going to
make it and I think you think the same
of me and whatever so it doesn't matter
the time doesn't matter it's just like a
detail and I and then that just makes
you think in terms of like it's like
seeing your whole graph of your entire
life you know like well I think this guy
is right I think even how quickly I like
how much time I put into the game how
much quickly I Rise it's just a matter
of time it just doesn't matter this just
doesn't matter in the long run so that
that was also good advice I think so
yeah yeah that's a really really
powerful one I'm glad appreciate that
because I think often we get so attached
to the short-term Narrative of what's
happening but if we can zoom out and go
right I'm going to make it I'm going to
get the results I want it might take a
bit longer than I that I would like it
to but I'm okay with that I think often
when it comes from somebody else as well
who knows you and can see the work
you're putting in it allows you to see
like a a zoomed out perspective and go
wait a second like what's happening now
I probably won't even know or care about
it maybe I'll speak about it on a
podcast with the wo and Adam but other
than that it won't be a significant part
of my life because I'll get past that
that phase I also feel as well like when
you're go through a hard period just
remind yourself of the story it's going
to be at the end of it it's one of those
things like we're all on like a hero's
journey when it gets really [ __ ] it's
like oh this going to be a great chapter
of the book this is going to be so good
when I get other side of this one this
is going to be a a nice story to tell
but I think for you obviously you uh
maintained a lot of confidence through
this patch as well I'm sure there was
times of doubt I'm curious to know for
you how do you maintain your confidence
when things aren't going well like how
do you continue to show up it seems like
for you you continue putting the work in
trying to learn trying to solve the
problems how do you maintain that
confidence that you can solve these
problems and you get the side of
it to be honest I don't really I don't
really know if you maintain the
confidence I you just go forward and
hope everything works out in the end I
think I think that's if people tell you
I always believe him I think it's
[ __ ] I think you just especially
when you're someone so inexperienced
like me who you know it's not that you
have like two million winning up every
time you go up in a stake you're new in
the stake and you don't really know if
you're a winner so for me I think
uh the the the reality is like like you
know I think I'm going to make it so
let's just go on uh hopefully we turn
around I will keep St I will study as
hard as I can uh I asked a few friends
you know hey do you think I'm R like am
I really bad like you know so I tried
fix I looked into my game um obsessively
what am I doing wrong what am I doing
right you know what should I work on
like I just tried everything and I trust
in the end it will work it would work uh
I don't know I think it's there's
nothing more you can do than that I
think I do really think because I like
honestly deep down you don't know if
it's going to work out but you just like
it's it's like life you just go with it
and like
hope yeah the uncertainty is always
there right we never get the the certain
this is going to work out I know it is
but I think for you like as you
mentioned there what you did is you just
kept moving forward you just kept
putting the work and I feel like
confidence is often the belief that I
can show up in the way I say I'm going
to and the actions that I'm putting in
over time will get me the results I want
and in moments you can feel like
self-doubt but still act with confidence
like still act as if like a confident
person would by taking actions I think
that's a kind of a missing piece because
like like I said it's not like you're
waking up every day going I know it's
going to work out but at the same time
you're you're you're put in the work and
you're going right I I trust that over a
long enough sample size if I keep
showing up and banging my head against
the door that it's going to and I think
this is like building evidence with
action I think this is where some
players go a bit as Strayer when they uh
they want to have confidence without
putting the work in and it's so hard
like it's so hard to fear confidence
like you can do for a little bit but if
you're not putting the work in you know
you're not you know what the competition
is so I think for you like one of the
other things was well it feels like
you're a hard worker so I'm curious to
know where you've got your work ethic
from is this been a I know your
basketball background definitely
impacted that but have you been someone
who's always been able to apply
themselves quite well and do you feel
like yeah how do you feel like you uh
are able to put a lot of work into what
you do I don't think I would say
something um I am sometime someone that
applies myself I think if anything I'm
the opposite I'm really messy and stuff
but I think in the stuff I'm interested
in which for example was basketball at
the beginning I would really really like
I just you know like if for example I I
used to be [ __ ] as [ __ ] in [ __ ] in the
basketball like shooting sorry I
shooting um I was yeah I was really bad
at shooting right because I was like
fast and stuff but like my outside shot
was very bad going up so I just went to
take infinite shots and I like read
online what should I do and I tried it
and I and then I also saw the result I I
got way better I still wasn't a super
good shooter but I got decent so when
once you see see the feedback loop which
in most stuff is like really delayed
like you go to to practice shots for
three months and after that time you
improve a little bit same with poker you
stud a spot like it's not going to like
you just w w instant instantaneously
more money so uh it was it was always
like that I think and I I I worked
really hard and I I I was really hard on
myself too and I think I could have
worked harder for example in basketball
when I was growing up or stuff I think I
would have done much work and probably
would have been better uh I do think
there's like a limit in terms of like
you have some talent and you cannot like
achieve more than there's everyone has a
ceiling but of course that ceiling is it
could go depends on how how how hard you
work and I I I kind of regret I think I
could have worked a little bit harder on
my basketball um so I decided also like
if you get a second chance or anything
like for example now poker just don't
leave anything on the table so I think
that that was good teaching or teaching
moment from from basketball for example
I still I still work really hard but I
could have could have done more I think
yeah I think that's a a mindset as well
which is really powerful like when
someone works hard like yourself you you
almost think like I don't work hard CU I
could work harder you mentioned like I
did infinite amount of shots to get my
shot better that's like a a dedication
that mosters wouldn't do this great well
I suck at this I'm not going to I'm not
going to put that much work in to get
better but you realize that putting reps
in doing repetition could get you better
at stuff and then when you got to Poker
you're like all right well I can get
better I put in more and more kind of
work to to to master my craft over time
now you did mention there that there's a
sealon that people have I think you
mention the question there that you
think you need talent to succeed in
poker so I'm curious to know for you
what talents or characteristics do you
feel are needed to succeed in poker and
where do you think sealing for players
exist who do not possess those
traits I was thinking more in terms of
basketball when I said it but I think it
sort of applies to most staff uh what
talents it's I think it's I think it's
very Broad and I
think and I think that's something
really funny because when you play maybe
lower Stakes there's a lot of people
playing weird strategy and stuff but
since you're playing low
stakes I don't know them like maybe
they're bad just bad but when you get to
like higher stakes and people been
playing for a long time you still see
people with weird strategies or stuff
like what is this guy doing but they win
and and you learn first of all you learn
to respect them which at the beginning
you know it's very important you learn
to be like okay you know this guy is
doing some weird stuff but maybe he has
a reason and you realize maybe this guy
sucks at this spot but in this spot he
has like so maybe some guys have really
intuitive talent in terms of like they
they can really sniff off some some
bluing spots some big pots and they
maybe they just don't care about the
tiny that they just don't they're not as
accurate in like small pots but they
just have like
a yeah they just sniff out Bluffs more
often in in Big B and that 5% difference
in terms of like they Bluff catching in
a big but just compensate and more for
for maybe whatever they use the wrong
sizing or three but who cares so uh I
think yeah there's a lot of talents that
go with poker some people are just like
very good at having strategy and
executing in no matter like whatever the
weather the the how many buy they lost
whatever they just can go play two hours
the same strategy Jesus they're like a
sand master you know and those people
like they you just feel like they're
unbreakable so I think there's a lot of
different talents and of course the one
that has the most the the more amount of
those of course is going to be better or
harder to play against but I think
uh yeah I think there's many many
talents I would say of course the year
has to learn or like that is also like
important uh but yeah I think there
there's countless of those some people
just get the theory stuff much quicker
uh some yeah some people have a natural
like intuitive exploit exploitative like
thought process that they right really
often but they don't know why uh I
remember I had a friend who who used to
play and and if you ask him about a hand
he would tell me I don't know I just
thought I don't know he would he would
not be able to explain anything about
his his his
game but he just crushed and he and like
he just had probably good instincts and
you know and he just did so well but you
could not talk to poeran about him it's
just like you could only talk about a he
used his siing I thought he was [ __ ]
but but that's like whatever the max you
could get from him but he just somehow
like I think it was the like perfect
example of unconscious competence you
know that and I think yeah so I think
there's many talents many many stuff
that works yeah I had a friend like that
as well who was bit of a genius with
intuition but you couldn't you couldn't
extract that Knowledge from him because
he just couldn't back to you very
frustrating because you're like are you
withholding information from me just so
I I can't get it from you um he would be
like the worst coach ever and somehow
yeah it like wor coach but like yeah it
just it works for him for people yeah
works for him can't be
replicated yeah so you mentioned like
there's a lot of talents you can have
and I I agree there like a wide range of
skills for you personally what do you
feel like are some of your talents or
traits that you've developed that have
allowed you to have success in
po that's a tough question
um I don't know I feel um one thing I I
do have and I'm this like I have a super
good memory like I can remember H I
played like two years ago of course not
exactly but like I don't know a break
came on the turn it was three or four I
don't remember but like I I have very
good memory if I played a hand vers you
last month I probably have it somewhere
in my mind so when I'm playing I kind of
like have all that stuff in mind um so I
maybe I I I you know if I saw a sizeing
from you and those stuff I think help me
especially coming up but still do now uh
and I yeah if I end up a session I want
to I like talking h a lot I don't know
some people like just end the session
and like well just talk about something
else [ __ ] it I've been two hours like
with my brain and I want to like talk
all the time about about poker um or
about especially if it's a poker friend
but yeah I think my memory really help
helped me like remember like small stuff
and from hands or like maybe from things
I
study uh and then I don't think I do
well I don't know maybe I'm very
analytical or very logical in in the way
and maybe that helps I don't know yeah
that memory definitely sounds like a bit
of a superpow to uh remember hands from
long periods of time ago even it's like
just a data point in your head I'm sure
like you pick up little signals in in
pots where other players might have
missed it because you've got that kind
of sample size already kind of stored
there um I'm curious to know now about
your ability to focus I think you me
mentioned earlier that you did some
12-hour sessions early in your career
I'm curious to know how you stay focused
during long sessions and what do you do
when you distractions arise how do you
keep yourself feeling
[Music]
Shar I don't know really I I'm not maybe
I'm not a great example I usually play
with some sort of Music in the
background which I probably think is not
ideal uh but it just helps me I don't
know I just always been like that um but
yeah I don't think I'm the best example
of that but I
just I don't know I just I'm very
focused on on trying to like have a game
plan for more situations so I'm thinking
about that and if I see something that
makes me want to alter it uh yeah I try
to like keep that in mind so I kind of
have a lot of stuff in mind when playing
so making sure that information is
available and ready maybe it's what me
focused but other than that I don't
really know that's focus a nutshell for
me I think if
you ability to keep keep your attention
on what's important and what matters for
as long as you can so for you it sounds
like because you've got a clear game
plan and you're checking in with that
game plan you're also paying a lot of
attention to opponents your mind's just
it's fixated on what you're doing so the
attention is just fully focused so when
I ask you what you're doing you're like
I'm just playing poker and thinking like
I'm just focused I'm locked in so yeah
it feels like one of those things that
probably comes more natural to you than
other players players cuz some players
May struggle to keep their attention on
their game strategy and that the might
might drift a bit more more frequently
so for you I'm wondering about how you
respond to pressure and you've rose up
the stakes fairly quickly and you I'm
guessing you're playing opponents who
maybe you looked up to not long ago and
you're in games with them how do you uh
respond when you're playing maybe let's
say an opponent who you respect who's a
very good player how does that impact
you in anywh do you feel any sort of
pressure or do you feel like your
strategy changes or did it in the past
well it's sort of like a process you go
through um because when the first time
you start going up Stakes the what
everyone tells you you're like w this
guys will have laugh on every spot you
have to start calling down because now
people are really good they will have
BLS in this spot and nobody has BL um so
at the first time you always like
happens it happens this thing where you
over respect people and then realize
well they have leaks as well
um and and you start like sort of like
a like a middle ground that you find um
in terms of pressure like I always enjoy
like I playing basketball growing up you
get to you suffer like you go through a
lot of pressure uh from the coach uh
like tells you do that and I look maybe
the game is tied so that that was
probably good for me in terms of like
and I always enjoyed it I thought and I
also like saw the good players and I saw
well this guys do really well in doing
pressure so I just try to try and do the
same thing not not that I did but I
tried and in terms of Poker like when
you play someone that's really good of
course you get like you get the an easy
feeling of of like whatever you do is
gonna outplay like it's I canot do like
whatever I do everything feels in
different you get that feeling at first
but I
think
um you just I mean of course if he's at
the table you probably try to avoid the
good players if you can because like if
they think you think they are better
than you you already lost the battle
right so you shouldn't like play there
at all but if you have to play because
there's like a good spot or like yeah a
recreational I mean you just try to play
the best you can you just have a
strategy play the best you can do and
like whatever he's better he's going to
probably beat you in some spot hopefully
you can get some of that bad by beating
him in some spot you stud it better and
if not not then it is life then you beat
like it's a chain of command like maybe
you can beat someone else and he beats
you what you going to do you hopefully
can get up the next morning and improve
so somehow he beats you less and then
hopefully then he takes the vacation and
you you know surpassing what can you
really do I think like given you can
select who you play uh and you can maybe
the better players you can only play
them when you have no shot uh then no
other chance because then that's fine
and also you can enjoy it as a competive
competition like maybe you you play
someone that you feel like you're like
from Break Even to slightly losing but
it's not that much you can play to like
push yourself but of course you have to
keep in mind that you're basically
losing money there and time so so yeah I
think this is balance between that yeah
I was going to ask do you enjoy that the
competition element of playing tough
opponents I think some players might get
intimidated by going to high levels to
play players you see players who like
play the same level for like many many
years they've got a good win rate it's
like that level above they how create a
mental barria of everyone's so good
there and they just create a some sort
of narrative that stops them I think for
you like obviously your competitive
background it feels like you're kind of
used to that situation you're used to uh
okay these guys are good cool let's dive
in let's play them let's learn and yeah
that when you're in a let's say you've
move up Stakes many times let's say you
move to a new level and the level feels
pretty hard to begin with you're playing
some of these really good opponents how
are you problem solving all right I'm
slightly Behind These Guys right now but
I'm going to catch up how how's your
mind kind of battling with that cuz some
people will overwhelm themselves go
right these guys are better I I'll move
back down but if you say for you the
speed you've moved up you must have been
overcoming these obstacles pretty
frequently so I'm curious to know what
your approach was well thankfully I
think given that we are humans you can
usually see someone making a mistake
even they're really good so you can chew
on that and feel like he did he's human
[ __ ] him right I can maybe beat him of
course there a little bit delusional but
I think you kind of have to be a little
bit overconfident and be a little you
have has to be a little small tiny small
amount of overconfidence in yourself
just to like believe you're maybe a
little bit better than you are but not
delusional because you're going to be
broke um or humbl back to you know limit
500 but like you have to have that extra
you know thing where you sit down and
maybe over time the you just continue to
study and then you get more adapted to
the metag game to the higher St order
and then you can get more even I think
um and yeah of course seeing someone
else do a mistake uh really helps and I
think uh some players and I think what
what ends up happening is she after
moving up and seeing players that you
saw in the YouTube clips of them playing
in poker stars and the the chip sound
after the chip sound of millions of
thousands of dollars you realize some
players are not that good and then you
realize some players are really really
really really good and but so at least
you you know or at least to it's very
subjective though because like when when
you play the the sample is so low that
you sometimes if you play the same pool
you ask someone else and you think oh
this guy is really good and you think
well he's he's done this against me so
it's Al always very subjective but in
the end I think uh first of all like
after playing and see see some mistake
you can at least light to yourself and
see oh look he make a mistake he's
beable uh just a little small lights to
keep you going and of course sometimes
you find someone that like really does
not make a mistake or like somehow um
it's making all the right exploits
versus you and then you you probably
treat with care uh but you at least you
realize it's not the bulk or the
majority of the
players you imagine you gain confidence
from seeing other players make mistakes
especially good players this opens my
mind to think what happens on the
opposite end of the spectrum when you
make mistakes how do you process them
yourself when you're yeah in into
lineups and you you you've made a
mistake how do you generally uh handle
that in those uncertain
moments well that's a good question I
remember there was this podcast uh not
long ago about with with the the I poker
where you guys were talking about being
harder on yourself and I I remember
thinking that um and that's that's what
I think I have to I worked a lot in that
myself because the the mentality
required to Su like the in sports it's a
given like everyone teaches you like
Kobe Bryan used to be really hard on
himself when he made a mistake like
everyone tells you that but I think in
poker um you have to be more you have to
be more relaxed like you know more calm
with that and I think the the the the
destroy the opponent me mentality that
that Sports cultivates us it's okay
because it's a physical sport and if you
get angry whatever you probably get much
more power your muscles work but in
since it's 100% mental game like I don't
know in chest I don't see if you want to
really beat your opponent you cannot
like really get angry and play better
because it's a mental game you cannot
like your your arm will not be stronger
if you get angry maybe sport it sort of
works that way sports are still mental
though but like there such a big
physical component that that's sort of
like works but in in poker it's not and
it's actually it's the opposite if you
get angry or like slightly angry you're
going to play way worse so I think
Translating that you know fire into fuel
but different kind of fuel because
you're fueling your brain not your legs
or stuff has been really important for
me because it's like manifesting the
compet competition or the willing to
destroy someone else or try in a
different way and I think that's that
that's been really important so and I
think being hard yourself is another
example of that like I think maybe in
sports I think it's is ultimately
bad and there are many books and
information about that but like at least
it's very common in sports and I think
going to more like permissive and like
loving talk with oneself is much better
and and it's still something I work on
is to engrain in myself about many years
in my in my childhood of like missing
missing a shot and being like like dumb
what are you doing right or like doing
some wrong decision um but yeah how have
you been able to channel that aggression
into different fuel source you mentioned
like for sport like it's a it kind of
have some positives especially the
physical body but with the mind it's
it's often needs to be it's like
redirected in a way and use different
Fuel and you mentioned like you use it
as a different fuel source I'm curious
to know for you like how that plays out
so you've got this aggressive tendency
you mentioned like Michael Jorge Your
Role Model because he's got this kind of
fight nature to him now you're playing
poker and you've got this kind of
aggression in you this want to kind of
kill the opposition but you realize know
wait a second I need to use this
differently so how are you uh directing
that differently at the PO tables I mean
you have to try and think more
strategically I think Michael Jordan
made a pretty bad Gambler I probably
made a really bad poker player I don't
know but that's what I he so yeah in
terms of that I think you can take the
aspect of like will wanting to like be
better than your opponents but you have
to reframe it and yeah I'm thinking more
strategically if I see someone do
something wrong uh first of all it's
hard to if you start watching for other
people's mistakes first of all you forgo
your own which are more important second
of all you get this constant feeling of
entitlement because you feel like oh
this guy's making these mistakes and
he's beating me and in poker like even
though you play someone make more
mistakes than you he's gonna beat you a
lot of he's going to win you cannot win
100% hands versus nobody even even if
they don't know the rules so
you know getting comfortable with that
situation of like maybe playing someone
you believe is slly worse than you and
him getting the best of you uh even if
it's by luck or even he outplay you he
will out you know he can exploit you
once you you can call in a spot you
think he's bluffing too much and then he
turns out he was going through Val so
getting like comfortable with that uh
and trying to channel your your willing
to out to to be better than the other
person in terms of Strate strategy
like be practical like okay I see this
how can I use this information to refine
my strategy so be more like strategic
more like I don't know
um practical not just like oh I'm going
to just sit with the with him and just
win by just being next to him because
he's just so bad that that doesn't work
like that and yeah I think I I remember
uh another podcast of you guys it was
like with Y bro and he was saying
like think how will the EV flow towards
you in the table like how how okay
you're sitting in a table you think
you're winning how are you winning like
are you winning by the you know not just
sit because I think I'm better like like
visualize that be coming to you and how
it's coming and then then it and I think
that's really powerful advice and very
interesting and and I remember listening
to it and really really having an effect
to me so yeah
yeah I like that channeling that energy
in a different way and it's almost like
more strategic more patience and not
getting caught up in like the the
shortterm flaws and Es and flaws of
being competitive and trying to to win
win against the competition so for you
like do you have any uh actually I'm
curious like throughout your career
let's let's go back as your journey your
experience with emotions like the
emotional side of it all right so we've
talked about logic we've talked a lot
about frame and stuff but at the same
time like the the body often responds
quite visy to to the PO experience and
we can experience the up down so we're
trying to uh think strategically we're
trying to use our long-term framing but
we're experiencing like frustrations and
emotions so for you uh yeah I want to
know which emotions you've experienced
throughout your career and which ones
have you had a battle
with um I well I learned that you you
kind of there's no like when you start
working on mental game maybe reading
like jar tender or
whatever doing those stuff you realize
that there's no escaping emotion and you
just have to like minimize the impact
they have on you or how or don't let
them like take the take over your your
you I mean there's no shutting them down
and actually that would be even bad I
think to to not have like try to shut
them down because I think they are
useful in some poker spots because like
if you see the other guy slightly
tilting you can recognize by I don't
know how like maybe he's playing too
fast like after a big pod you l so I
think if you're not connected to your
emotions you would miss some some stuff
about other other other people that that
you that you really don't want to miss
so I think it's not about shutting them
shutting them off but rather than
acknowledge them have them go through
you and hopefully leave no SCAR or like
leave no nothing in you that can change
your game which is really hard and maybe
you get like tilted but if you get
tilted for 30 seconds uh it's is going
to be fine right May unless you're in
four Big pots at the same time that
might but that will happen very
frequently usually you just a ping
preflow while you're like tiled about
the the last hand and then if you 30
seconds after that you're good to go or
like 90% then that's fine so that's goes
back to being like permissive with
yourself and like realizing you're not
going to be never going to be a machine
right so so I think that's that's how I
try and deal with emotions and yeah and
I think they are important in terms of
like and also for playing versus like
for some recreationals trying to
understand them you know I think it's
it's something you you never want to
shut shut
down yeah I I like all the things you
said there especially around like
acknowledging emotions are part of being
human and you need to learn to
experience them I like the letting them
emotion pass through fully and fully
experiencing it but also like trying to
Take Back Control in that state I think
often an emotion can carry you away let
say you're frustrated it's very easy to
act out of that frustration rather than
going oh I feel frustrated right now
this is going to pass through me but
also not allowing yourself to get like
too far off center or off the track of
your strategy sounds like for you uh
you've kind of allowed yourself to uh
experience a full range of emotions and
hasn't hasn't taken too much of a hold
on you have you had any uh experi it
probably has has before but I I also
think it's it's it's like knowing your
biases is good as well like knowing
whenever you're slightly off your best
game you tend to have this biases so now
it's become a battle between yourself
where you're like taking a decision and
you know your bias you know and you kind
of can guess you're in certain States
and you know in certain State you have
to that bias so now you have more
information to make a better informed
decision right uh if your bias is to
become nitty once you lost a lot of big
Pods at least if you're aware and all
about that you can you know correct that
a little bit or the other way around so
I think knowing how you tend to behave
in terms of stress or emotional stress
also helps you in terms of like having
those emotions not affect you as much
because they they're affecting you at
the time but you also know they are so
you're just trying to wrestle into like
the most objective decision possible
which is really hard of course but yeah
I love this I love this is of a high
level I really like the the angles
you've taken on explaining this because
that's exactly how I say it like an
emotion creates a tendency or a bias
that leads an action but it happens
quite predictably in a way that you can
spot it observe it and then modify your
behavior because you know it's going to
come myself and Ry were just talking
before this uh podcast actually about
how players sometimes struggle to change
a bias you can spot a bias go what I
feel frustrated overall the spot but
even with information some people
struggle to change that it sounds like
for you when you know bi is there when
you can spot it you're able to modify
your behavior do you feel like that's
something that's you're quite good at or
something that you've had had to work on
I had to work a lot on that uh I
remember there was this book which is
called Body Mind Mastery by Dan milman
that I read uh when I was pretty much
quite younger I think and I have to ReRe
and and but one of the stuff that it
teaches is a short book and it was like
a I think Olympic gymnast or maybe I'm
wrong but like he basically said when
you're trying to correct something that
you're doing wrong in any sport uh you
usually have to go the other side you
know what I mean like if you're
I know you're just hitting a baseball
with too much strength you have to like
compensate overco compensate that first
because so you have that by sewing great
so if you s someone that you know CS a
lot on the river uh sometimes it's okay
to like the first month you're trying to
work on that have overfall it's just
only natural you cannot correct your
biases by like aiming to be just in the
middle just where you want to be no yeah
you will like you will overcompensate
and that's fine and getting comp with
that also from from that they mention in
that book I think it's also helpful
um and yeah yeah love that yeah I think
it's very true when you're too far one
way you of need to swing far the other
way and before you find that equilibrium
it's really hard to like just modify
slightly back into that little midpoint
and also think you've got to um
experience what it feels like to be on
the opposite side let's say you're
always falling a spot then you get used
to always calling like that extreme um
difference all a you get the pain points
of that you're like ah wait a second I
call but not that but and it kind of
like cause correction and over time you
kind of modify to to the middle but
you've got to experience that especially
when you're you're very extreme on way
all right I'm going to pass you to reny
I've got like loads of different so many
new questions come up every time you say
something so I could definitely go down
a few different rabbit holes R I know
you've got a lot of questions yourself
so let you dive back in yeah I mean uh
so much so much things to dive into I
want to straight away uh um hook into
what you mentioned about bias because I
find it such an interesting topic
obviously for that you need to be self
and always be on the lookout for your
own game and tendencies uh I think in
the beginning you said uh and I know you
a little bit as well of course we played
we done some strategy you in the
beginning in the beginning you said uh I
would for example tell myself stop
calling right because it's probably
probably a a bad bias of yours or at
least a bad tendency in the past so I
was wondering how did you over overcome
that like what did you consciously do to
override this bias like I said you
talked about like in game actually uh
taking account for it so most probably
if you think if you think the spot is
probably Clos it's probably a
fault if you have a bias vice versa yeah
I I I agree I feel like
um I I remember like when I mentioned
that that I was thinking like yeah I
remember writing in my my noteb I I have
a lot of notebooks and I also like this
past year I started journaling I just
like yeah this this guy I know I don't
know who it was but like some top guy
he's Journal so I [ __ ] it I'll Journal
uh I'll try it anyways I kind of like it
because you can put your thoughts into
writing and you just digest them and you
just feel liberated after but I mean I
think it works for like every some
there's a lot of different stuff that
works for everyone uh but I remember
writing that uh I I had the feeling that
I was like maybe versus recreational in
SPS they all you know they Tong pot in I
wasn't being uh disciplined enough to
make the folds that you like come on you
just know it was like the you're tilted
they got there and you call anyways when
so I had that problem when I was
starting so I just wrote it down
um but I
think thinking about the later stages of
of of my career I think trying to like
you know when sometimes you take a
decision out loud or you got okay I'm
going to f and then your hand clicks
call and or or or vice versa I'm not
going to Bluff and then you just Bluff
why so trying to see what was going on
right in that moment which is really
hard because there's a lot of emotions
stuff going on through your head when
you're playing four tables or six tables
but trying to think what was that made
me do that how did I feel at the time
and analyze that feeling and seeing okay
so the root for this problem stuff that
I'm doing that is is is this and
something some find some way to inject
some logic like like Jared said like
find some logical way to to counter to
to to deal with that
so for example if you're if you're
bluffing a river that you don't know if
it's like I don't know if you see a big
amount of money in the middle and you
say I could Bluff for I know a small
percentage of the pot and I could win
all all this in the middle if you
remember that your bluff is going to be
between I don't know zero B to like
minus five big blindes to five big
blindes even though a lot of the times
you're going to win what's in the middle
which is maybe I don't know 100
blinds you're just winning with that
click you're just winning or losing five
blinds so it's not that so like and
that's a perfect logical statement if
you go to the solver you see DB oh it's
high big one but in game sometimes that
is not like what you what you're
thinking so I think correcting in terms
of like thinking okay maybe you're doing
an action thinking about it would be
really nice to win a pod right now but
if you think about
TB uh your your action is just barely
it's just like the low amount of EB so
if you think about I'm going to click
for like 1.5 big planes best case then I
think that helps you deal with some of
your Tendencies I think I think it
reduces like the weight of the
emotions um so that makes it a bit
easier to make a rational decision the
process that I think you describing is
like I think Jared calls it the mental
hand history where you kind of go
through your thought process and think
about okay why did it make sense that I
do that what was my fault and what is
the flaw if you start to understand the
flaw and you you start to incorporate a
better way of thinking if you start to
understand the mental flaw in your
decision-making process then then then
you can count it and then in game it's
inde very important to start recognizing
okay this is the state or this is the
this is the emotions that I experience
leading up to the mistake that I
commonly make right so if you then can
start to recognize these emotions and
try to replace them or at least you know
recognize them be like hey wait this is
exactly the way I feel before I do this
stupid thing I always do then Le yeah or
like you can just combat the emotion
like I wish to do this but like the
logic indicates this is bad because of
this so that you at least you just have
an argument to the logic and emotion
that you previously
just had but unconsciously so yeah I
think that it is it is sort of like that
I think that's one way but there there
are many ways I think I think being true
to honest with yourself I think is a
very big part of Poker and I think it's
something that is maybe not talked about
the math or like maybe
not uh I think it I think poker is is is
a journey of like you you discover a lot
of stuff about yourself and some are
some stuff are not that that Pleasant
maybe uh but you you just forces you to
put yourself in the mirror and the the
easiest the less resistive uh smoothest
past path sorry is to be real with
yourself and don't [ __ ] yourself and
saying look here you're you're just here
you're pting because of this so you have
to fix this and and instead of thinking
no but I was doing because no he's over
so I so I think that's a very important
skill in poker and and I
think and it's and it's hard because you
have to look yourself in a mirror and
and realize you're probably bad or like
have a leak and you know accept that I
don't think it's that easy for many
people including myself you talked about
uh moving on from mistakes or from like
certain emotions do you do like
something consciously to move on for
example do you give yourself 30 seconds
to tilt or for example something that
really works for me if I've made a
mistake or I'm uncertain about a spot or
I'm a bit tilt about a spot what for me
personally really helps when I press
Mark the hand it's like I marked it so I
gave it a place it's for for the next
session I put it it away if I don't it
doesn't anymore I feel like you know I I
might I might want to look it up or I
keep remating on the spot but if I mark
it it's it's gone like I know I'm going
to look afterwards right now I'm just
going to focus on the next hand do you
have like something like like that that
you do no not really I think uh
maybe I don't if I mark it I could still
be reminiscing I'm not that disciplined
uh I don't know
I maybe I send the handun to someone and
have their like quick opinion if if they
are online but other than that I
just but I'm I like in the later stages
of my career I just punted so hard that
like I'm kind of cool with it like oh
okay P what are going do um it is what
it is not the first time not the last
time so I kind of like you know and and
when you're playing aggressively or
explosively or whatever you will be
wrong you will p and it's and
I don't know I just maybe it's like a
force of habit like oh made a call that
probably is dumb let's try not to make
it again right uh I don't know it's just
like being used to to pting Bic I think
yeah that's kind of the acceptance right
that I think we talked about ined in the
episode that you refer to with the with
the ey poker kind of like more the
acceptance and also I think he mentioned
it as well and I think I heard it before
and I don't recall which podcast that
like understanding that these mistakes
or these punts they're part of part of
your win rate right like you have let's
say you have a positive win rate and
these puns that you make they're part of
your wi rate obviously you know would be
great to start to do them less
frequently but when they happen it's
like yeah okay you know it's it's it's
part of it well I remember once I I it
was like maybe one or two months where I
was like yeah doing I concluded it was a
while ago but I concluded that I was
looking at my stats I'm like it's pretty
reasonable not not folding too much not
being aggressive enough like my stats
were were were kind of very good uh or
at least okay enough um but my win rate
maybe I had like a long break even
stretch winning one big plan you know
and I was like what's going on with my
game it was a significant sample to be
concern
and what what what was like what the
last thing that I had to check was like
well maybe I'm pting on big pots right
because my maybe my percentage of fold
on the river is is good but I'm making
the wrong decisions maybe I'm stationing
on spots that people you know don't have
enough BL like so I I I to focus on the
big pots and every time I would make a
pun a big pun I would just write it in
an Excel so pun uh what's St this take
how much like being objectively how much
because of course you call 80 big ones
in the river you don't lose 80 because
sometimes you know the guy has a stroke
and you he was bluffing but like if that
happens 1% of the time well you have to
calculate DB roughly right so I I would
make like a like an Exel of pants and
see at the end of the month how much I
pted in in pants uh so after see
whatever amount of dollars and like
subtract it like add it to your win rate
you see how much it so that was kind of
helpful too and it was fun and it was
like forc me to be more diligent uh so
that was a fun exercise I did for a
while and it kind of helped me and a
friend told me to do it so that's that's
a good one it's also fun because you
just you just like write the the exle of
Shame after the session you're like well
okay pant pre FL yeah yeah so that one
was helpful as well when you see it all
add up and I think also it helps to make
it Visual and I think when you analyze a
spot and you're trying to estimate the
EV probably you also come to the
conclusion because like in poker there's
just some spots that um your return of
investment is not how do I say this
equally divided in terms of best case
scenario I agree find all the Bloss that
that that that that that you fought in
game you make 2 but there's a scenario
where he misses all of them you lose 80
so it's like okay so best case scenario
when all my assumptions are wrong right
I make five bitb and when all my when
he's like completely on the opposite
side I lose minus 80 so probably you
started to recognize some these spots
like hey the return of investment is
very unfair I should probably not be
investing in these
scenarios for sure I think that's
exactly how if you if you think about
this like a normal distribution uh yeah
sure some if you're right that's like
exactly and I and I use that logic to
talk to friends or if I ever have a
student or whatever like you know what's
the best case to worst case scenario and
the problem is yes and it's exactly what
you said I agree 100% And that Pro this
this this typing out the mistake thing
or the P probably help in that regard as
well for sure yeah especially if you
have problem with Bluff catching if for
your bluff catch to be correct you have
to literally give him all the Bluffs and
he has to Bluff them always and then you
you are at a plus of V scenario most
likely not not a great call okay let's
yeah or like with a yeah or with a bluff
of yourself like sometimes you're
bluffing into a range that you know
maybe maybe it's going to be hard for it
to fold enough or you're just being too
Wishful that that the guy still has some
combos that he can fold and maybe he
fold it earlier now there's still a lot
of stuff of room to to make puns uh so
yeah I think it's being honest with that
assessment is is really important or it
really helps at least I wanted to touch
on something that just said earlier
which I think uh was a big game changer
in your career you move you said that
you moved away from Plenty thinking
which I I think with that you mean like
very theoretical oriented you know if I
think about or at least from what I saw
in clenty when he when he used to make a
run at ones video you know the RNG was
spinning doing everything at a balanced
frequency Etc what made you move away
from this type of thinking and what did
you replace it with and how did that
impact your
game um well it was it was couple of
things first it was I mean I was first
started in like it was like a Sith cth
poker I was like in that Discord that's
was where I first started and that um
school or whatever that uh Academy
whatever whatever they were um it was
super theoretical but to to an autistic
Point like there were a lot of brilliant
people on that server they were like
mathematicians scientists whatever it
was a little bit too excessively you
know theoretical but it help me helped
me a lot in in in understanding some
stuff uh and I think I'm grateful I
started that that path but I ended up
too theoretical not very practical but
exploiting
um and I think I was missing that street
poer thing uh a little bit that you old
guys probably have because and then so
that comes from like actually you know
trusting your God and stuff so I was too
too ingraining that stuff and then after
climbing to to 500 and having like a
very like a first and upswing but I
think I think I had like 180k hands of
being break even I so to two two things
happened I think I got into a Spanish
coach uh and I like Spanish coaches and
SP Spanish people are always known by
their exploited that they are not very
Theory Theory oriented they don't care
about it and I remember I only had five
lessons with the guy but he was I they
were about playing versus recreationals
and he started like doing some stuff
that I was like what the [ __ ] it was
like so sick like making huge BS with
maybe not that great of hands I don't
know but playing like really insane like
he would say like okay I'm gonna flat
jackon off on the bottom when the fish
opens because all like because the fish
the huge wheil is on the big one I'm
like what so a lot of stuff and and I
could I could tell that the guy in terms
of theory didn't know much but he opened
my mind in terms of exploited poker um
so that was one thing that that I
started to realize where the the EV
comes from well it's from the
recreationals and I'm not maximizing my
win rate versus them I'm just like
thinking that by showing up I'm playing
proper ranges I'm going to win which is
it is true but you're not maximizing
which is terrible right um and I do
think also that when you when you and I
think this is just a theory but I kind
of see it live too that whenever you
pound on a recreation like you ISO him a
lotting a lot like you just go for him
he gets it gets personal and he just
gives you action in return whereas if
you like are the guy that just you know
plays like tight versus him and just has
always good good hands um he will he
will deep down no I mean at least most
most recreationals but I think if you
tell him you just like you know do a
little bit of like one BBC b or like
check Min like sometimes you throw in a
couple of stuff like that you end up
like building a tilt on him and he just
passed like he wants to give you action
more and I think that's really important
imagine someone that you ISO to nine big
lines and he calls twice as often than
versus another one you just printing
money and just by attacking him more um
of course you have to be careful who you
have behind um but yeah that that was
one thing and I think
also I did uh watch your uh course on
like the the first one the first edition
and it was like
I remember a part where it was like how
how
does how does YB where where does YB
come from in terms of the game and it
was like a very good uh teaching moment
because it was like how to translate
what the solware tells you how to apply
it like into like studying it in order
to exploit because like a lot of this
the the solver is is I mean the solver
is balanced and for for this and that
reason why everything is the same e like
why checking your Bing is the same but
if you think about what's going to
happen later uh maybe it's not the same
E versus humans or maybe versus one
person is is something
is more and versus the other player
there's there's it's not so trying to
find why the Sol does what it does is
that happening in real life yes no is
that happening more right so that helps
you build a more deeply you know thought
out expl exploitative thing because it's
not like if someone overflows to the see
it you just see it more that's just very
level one exploiting but if you like
start opening more because he will get
to that nde more maybe you open smaller
because now he defends a wider range and
now he like you you Pummel on that leak
from all the angles that you can right
um and there's like a million more stuff
you can do not just like the the level
one exploit and then yeah I think that
was like uh a good um teaching moment
about how to because I was like starting
with solvers in a way of like learn a
strategy I learn a couple of stuff from
the solver and try to implement the best
I can now it was more like a
conversation with the solver like see
what he does why does it well learn
what's going on try to come up with a
recipe of my own in game then check and
then be open to being wrong and I think
that that's where I would I become I
became much more of an exploited player
and and and and that was a very big
change in in my in my game the biggest
maybe uh and it was run around that
first year the the middle of the first
year where where that happened and I
think those two things were like the
biggest the biggest thing I just went
from becoming like very like it'll just
play GTO and just win somehow to like
you know grabbing the ball like taking
taking action and like going for it and
yeah it's interesting because like
obviously there's like many many camps
right in poker especially if you look at
the extremes you have the extremes you
have the clanes the gto's then you have
like the the full MDA strategy guys you
have the guys who only exploit on a Hut
uh what you kind of mentioned is you
obviously did um understand Theory but
it sounded like you started to use a
solver more Crea creative creatively I
remember also in the beginning you
mentioned ah if the I cannot check raise
it solves it by dunking and it sounds
like you started to get a way more
Curious approach to the solver and to
what type of strategies you can
Implement how did you then find the
correct balance between still um
applying certain theoretical Concepts
but still be on the lookout to exploit
because I can imagine a lot of people
usually struggle with that right there I
don't know I'm going to go f exploit now
or no I'm going to go f Theory where is
the
balance well I think that's why I'm
grateful in in the path that I took
because by being first on the solver
camp or whatever or like at least going
through that phase it prevented me from
going full monkey or like full
explorative in terms of because I
I there is a limit or like that it's
good to keep in mind some some some
stuff about the theory on how spots
works and then you can adjust it like if
you feel your opponent's cup to suring
hand that just means you can like the
the the theory that the adjusted Theory
would be you can go in 10 times a PO
with that hand plus one um
so then you I think that the best course
of action and and what I see from most
high stakes players is like they try
to cook up a strategy where like it's
not exactly the theory it's like the
theory adjusted to what they think
you're doing and then they could be
wrong what you're doing but like they
usually right so I think that's that's
the the challenge but I think being like
knowing a little bit of of of Both
Worlds uh helped me in terms of not
becoming too extreme and I think that's
also something I like um I've been in
many like I've seen a lot of points of
view of people of Poker like I've seen
more moderate people that just play
their game and exploit on the on the on
the rough sides the Spanish people or
like usually the the the old Spanish
crew that like super exploitative but
then there's the new Spanish people that
are very solar oriented and still
exploit so there's a lot of like like
different approaches like something that
someone I really like is Yuri pelic for
example his P are really good and he
yeah that he's also really interesting
exploits and he thinks really well about
the game so I think uh trying to
uh understand or like to yeah trying to
get interiorized with with all the
different schools thinking process and
create like a some some thinking process
of my own I think was was very important
um I would like to I I I read some also
some of the blogs in Russia like the
Russian forums which translated some for
example Stefan or like some other guys
and that also like I I don't know enough
of course about but I think the Russians
are also have their own like school or
whatever and sometimes it's very weird
you see them weird stuff but there are
lot of very Su successful Russians and I
think Russians nationality is
historically very very tough to very
competitive like if you look at at chess
and stuff they're tough tough people
smart people so I think there's always
something to learn about everyone and
and I think
also I would like being open like even
if you see someone do the and something
even
more it's more reason to learn from
someone because when you go up and see
another R doing like a lot of mistakes
and you look at him and like how long is
he's playing six years he's been winning
he's winning at high stage for six years
and you just saw three mistakes in one
session what probably does that means
like my old self would be like this guy
sucks he's running so good my new or
like what I try to aim or I think it's
better to do is like he's probably doing
something really well that that offsets
all the puns that he just made uh so you
know maybe I can learn from from that
what it is and I think a lot of players
for example uh they're just so good at
playing versus recreationals or maybe
adopting versus other regulars and that
they just like do a lot of Theory pants
and it just doesn't matter and and like
just focusing on like well if someone is
winning at at a higher level then they
probably doing something right and focus
well what are they doing right instead
of only focus what focusing on what they
are doing wrong I think that's
good very uh very valuable valuable
lessons indeed I think that's something
that you learn when you put your ego on
the side right over over over your
career and you start to look at instead
of in the beginning you're like oh these
people are so bad so bad blah blah but
then you know it's it's a it's a it's an
evolution that you make as a poker
player I was wondering you mentioned I
think it was the jump to 2K I don't know
you mentioned something in your
conversation with Adam that you said you
were doing something wrong when uh when
moving up uh and you kind of got beaten
down
do you recall uh what it was about your
game that you had to change in order to
establish yourself uh at at those Stakes
at the higher Stakes well I think my
game was not solid enough to the game
selection
like I was I was choosing to to play uh
basically I was just basically not good
enough for who I was playing or how I
was playing I would play like maybe
sessions with a lot of heads up and
maybe too many tables versus play
players that were really sharp
and yeah you just have to be really good
to do that and I was not so
then reality check that that's basically
what happened not going to be like it's
just basically what happened going be
beating around the bush and then I well
try to change that a little bit game
select not play everyone you know play
only the guys that you think you have
something on them maybe you could be
wrong but this year like decided should
not play a lot of tables if you're
battling you know small small I think my
my game was not good enough to like I
had I had not the best mental game or
like you know yeah gu game selection is
sort of like a mental game I think so I
was not good enough uh yeah my my
technical game was not good enough for
how poor I selected some seeds so I
think that's what what usually happens
and then also you realize that even if
you're like I I remember
uh a run it once very old video from sa
very smart person very very like very
great great mind and he was saying like
a 1bb edge is basically pointless to
grind because the Baran is g to be so
big that whenever like the you're going
to change like if you're playing if I'm
playing someone heads up and I just
winning one big bline for the first 180k
hands the the the luckiest one will win
and they and and the luckiest one could
be someone that wins like you know 60
bins at that point he's going to be
playing way better poker than me so my
one BB would be punished I'm probably
even losing so basically small edges
with all the varant that that comes from
the game are not worth it uh especially
at higher Stakes where like there's a
lot of money in the line and it's hard
to get it win the money back at lower
Stakes so I think that really resonated
with me and made a lot of sense and and
yeah I think that's that's I think
that's really important to to take into
account like and and at one point you
have to be realistic with yourself
and and also yeah just just just you
know how much Edge can you possibly have
or and if you just play anyways at least
accept that you're doing out of flop for
the game maybe you're not going to be
making most amount of money and that's
fine but just accepting it and then if
you hit a big down then then like well
it could happen it was something with
within the Realms of possibility that
you were counting on happening because
of and and maybe you have to adjust and
you know lay low for a while or not but
like be more real like yeah exactly I
think that's that's the takeaway I think
what makes uh what makes these these
regulars at the higher Stakes so hard to
play against like what separates in
Europe opinion like the best sort of
from the rest and also I think you
mentioned earlier uh you know it's it's
okay to challenge yourself but don't
give your bankr to lonus what are like
so what sets the what sets the better
players apart and what are signs that
you need to look for to realize that
you're out class then maybe you should
uh leave the game okay it is hard I
think and maybe this is like an answer
that doesn't has no purpose or like it
you're going like what do I do with this
answer but I think it's just I think you
also get a feeling when you're playing
EI either a heads up battle or a
three-handed r battle you kind of
feel when you're just
getting where you kind of just where
you're just getting smashed you feel it
like you just feel like you're
clueless uh I think especially after a
lot of amount of hands uh whenever like
you're bluffing you get I don't know
there's something in in the way that in
the in how you feel in the moment that
you feel that you're and and that the
other way around also happens and and
and and it has not and and I think after
a lot of hands of hours played you can
separate like the variance it's not
because sometimes you're getting smash
because you're getting cooler but you
can separate like whenever in every
small pot it's always a hustle always
like whenever you check check check
check bet he raises and you have always
have you know all of those stuff I think
uh you kind of feel whenever you don't
have an edge or when I think when you
realize someone is better than you when
like you you just Mark 10 hands from the
guy that you were like well I think this
was weird and then you check it and they
were all like the correct place and you
didn't know about it at the time and you
mark as well maybe he just knows more
than you right so I think it's a mixture
of how you feel and reviewing hands them
being always right or more much more
right than you uh and then you realize
well maybe I'm out
class yeah I think especially I can
definitely relate to what you say about
how you feel I would say almost how in
control you feel you know referring back
to also what you br said in especially
in battles I think it's very important
that you know where the EV comes from
so for example I'm a big fan of when you
go in that you kind of have an
understanding of okay I'm going to play
this battle I know where if comes from
and then if you sit down and the game
starts and you indeed see that the money
is Flowing to you in the spots that you
were expecting the money to flow to you
because you know their mistakes that's
when you feel like you're in control and
you're kind of directing the match
whereas at some other matches you're
just like wait I feel no control
whatsoever I'm just reacting to whatever
these guys throw at me and I don't know
I I I don't feel contr and then for me
like the feeling of in control is a sign
like I don't know what's going on here
so chances are they're they're they're
just way ahead of
me and I think that's where like the
Styles come into place because uh and I
I
think yeah like some players have a
style which is like make them make the
game messy and this applies to sports to
as well like if you make them make game
messy and you are like very restructured
then you can probably beat someone like
there's like uh like I don't know like
the Pokemons that like fire beats water
it was the other way around but you know
what I mean like some sty clash and I
think I think a lot of like interviews
like maybe aora the Russian guy the
blonde one or or like that a lot of
people said well like maybe W battles
are not just about skill and about
matchup and styles and some matchups are
favored for a certain type of player and
that's just the way it is and and every
strategy game has like you know
this class of of whatever is better than
this so I think that also comes into
play and sometimes you're just help like
the guy that makes the game messy might
make some mistakes but maybe he uses to
to you a lot of spots where you're
uncertain of what what you do and maybe
that uncertainty causes you to play on
Focus because if if you're getting into
you used to play like 80% of the spots
you know what you do but now the guy you
know opens with 3.5 and you know that's
weird [ __ ] all of a sudden you're facing
a decision that you have to like rethink
or brainol in the moment over half the
time and maybe that stresses you to the
point you you can't execute then the guy
maybe is worse than you but just puts
you into put puts you in an arena that
you're not as comfortable as him and he
just he just beat you and and that's
that's also what can
happen yeah trigger it triggers a lot of
uncertainty which is definitely like an
aame killer right you you're being taken

join the weekly coaching webinars in
which one every month is with me looking
forward to educating you guys over
there you you you mentioned about um you
realize that we're doing something wrong
you also mentioned looking at your stats
and be like hey okay it looks like I'm
playing well how do you go about
improving as a player in terms of
identifying leaks and then fix
them
um well I mean yeah look at my stats if
I see something wrong like I'm check
falling too much or R something like
that which I had a lot of a lot of those
coming back I mean
coming up and sometimes I still do
um yeah I just try to review hands of of
that spot or maybe drill a little bit of
that spot but usually I just try to I
know I just review hands occasionally
like the newer spots that I've been
studying like I do some like study the
spot as a whole like try a lot of boards
see what happens with the strategy see
what the range versus Range interaction
looks like uh I I have a great like I I
love studying the game I think it's it's
really enjoyable for me uh for like it's
not I I love playing and I love studying
I I don't I don't have a problem so I
I'm really I really like complex
strategies uh and and that kind of
reflects a lot in my game I think
because I I like like limping on the
small line or whatever I think that's
opens a new uh area of possibilities
that is really fun and and I think it's
a little bit more unexplored that some
other stuff uh it has its downsides like
everything uh on on it upsides because
like at least like I think having such a
complex or broad strategy if you're
running bad is easier to do
yourself uh but at the same time
whenever you I know uh play people that
do the same thing like if you go to a
table and everyone is limping the small
and at least you're not in like
Uncharted Territory as much as if you
didn't right like at least you're used
to playing that spot as well uh so
that's it has his pros and cons and I
think there's a lot of successful
players that do either so I don't think
one is better than the other I just for
my personal stuff I think I enjoy more
because I just like love the game and
and love studying it and I think uh yeah
that's just my how I reflect like the
Love of the Game I think how how how the
strategy the complex it gets it's more
fun I think
yeah I I saw that in the questionnaire
we usually ask some some questions and
you could choose between uh simplified
strategy or using a complex arsenal of
lines and sizings um you already
mentioned like you know this triggers
like creativity makes it go more
enjoyful what do you think are like the
ups and downs side of then simplifying
your
strategy and in which areas do you do
you do you prefer to do
it I think simp simplifying is is still
like really good it it it helps you have
a simpler strategy so you spend much
less of your brain frequency or like the
amount of your brain power into
recalling what's what's sort of the
struts uh and even if you want to
exploit and you're thinking about how
should I exploit the wo um you only have
one dire un exploitable un exploit
well uh but you only have like One
Direction which is bit more often or
less often like if you bet one SI but if
you have a lot of complex stuff and now
you have to start there's all like you
go in in very different dimensions so it
it requires more
attention whenever you make a mistake or
you or like you're getting pummeled or
like it over obviously going to trigger
more more doubt if you're not playing
simplified because you could be doing EV
puns so I think there's like an upside
and a downside for both
um I at when I first started coming up
and I was this like very theoretical guy
I thought you you had to play a lot of
sizes or like that but after like being
around and and I'm seeing a lot of very
successful players play really simple
strategies they just they just work I
think that's just not the case and I
think both are fine and it's just it's
just like Styles like everyone has their
own style I think I think like the best
the biggest benefit in my opinion from
like let's just call it having a more
complex strategy or at least more more
lines and sizes in Your Arsenal is you
can then from there adjust your
frequency in a certain sizing let's say
you play let's say you play a split from
the small blind okay you limp and Rise
the exact frequency that I would limp
versus one guy or race versus another I
can then adjust based on how he plays
whereas if I would only play only and
suddenly start to limp a lot versus guy
he's like wait you never limp why do you
limp versus me whereas if I always limp
he doesn't know the exact frequency I do
it versus him you understand so from
there I I would I would never do that I
would only play the GTO frequency but
yeah I understand what you mean no yeah
I get
it no I agree I agree and then also
whatever stats you have are just
reflecting your stats versus everyone in
the pool so it's kind of hard to know
what the guy is doing for you and I
think yeah the more complex the strategy
the more you know you can like hide and
and stuff but
so it's very tuxing on your on your on
your mental so I think true I think
there there are spots yeah I think um
you haven't seen the podcast yet but
probably the people that will see this
podcast have seen the podcast we did a
podcast with the Chris Chris NE Luke bra
on ACR and he mentioned that the the the
benefit of simplified strategy is it
gives you piece of mind I thought that
was very very very smart stuff like from
there you can just perform whereas in if
you play a more complex mix strategy
sometimes you're like am I am I now just
owning myself you know sometimes you
it's like it's like it's like the debate
of like more complexity more
exploitability sometimes you feel like a
genius but you know also comes the other
side of the
coin yeah for sure and I think it comes
down to how much will tilt you when you
get exploited by your own self compared
to the peace of mind like like I would
not it's it's nice to have peace of mind
but I don't I don't play for peace of
mind I think I play for blood if I can
and hopefully the other guys if it's my
own then I'll just review and just just
put a bandaid and move on so I think but
I understand I think there's so many
successful people and like if you for
example one guy like munes I don't know
play a little bit verus game and the guy
is just like a machine he just and like
you kind of feel like a little bit like
there's nothing I can do like there's no
hes in the guy's game but he also
doesn't like play he just doesn't care
about I think he probably doesn't even
know my my screen name he just play I
don't know so I think you just get that
feeling versus the very good
players that they just they just play
their own strategy they've been playing
that strategy for nine years they just
show up execute they are not going to
get into leveling war war wars very much
and they just win win win and you look
at the graph and just go straight up for
in very tough Stakes versus very tough
opponent so I think uh
both both both sides are both yeah if
you look someone at like lonus for
example he plays really complex strategy
I think so I think was funny like uh
back back in the days when there was
still when when when uh when OTB Red
Burn still rained R the tables and
together with lonus was funny like if I
would play against OTB he was like the
guy like a flop would come and I could
just expect anything like I'm not going
to predict but lonus was back then at
least in the other side he would have
just one step sizing or one this like
you would always know what to expect so
in that way it was sort of comfortable
but odia was always like oh no what is
he gonna do now and then you would see
the time go and he would always do
exactly the thing that I didn't want him
to do yes exactly both obviously lonus
was very good with his frequency blah
blah and back then at least with with
like a simplified but good strategy that
was hard to exploit but in one way it
was more comfortable to play against
than OTB who would every time just putop
me in the blender yeah and I think it
just depends on on the on what
impression do you like or do you feel
it's better to give your opponents I
think in in that case that you mentioned
the lius is like you get the impression
that you're helpless like whatever you
do he's going to be executing you cannot
explo like you're like well he's going
to show up play his strategy his
strategy is almost Flawless it's gonna
be hard at least I don't get put in
tough spots but you know at the end of
the day he's has such a good strategy
but on the other guy you feel like he's
really beating you so it's two different
feelings that you get and you know I
think uh yes versus some guys some some
style could work best and versus other
guys you know that's that's back to the
match up since we're talking about
throughout this conversation and
basically all conversations that we ever
had on this podcast you always here
study study study study study okay what
for you has been some of the most
efficient ways to
study uh it's really tough question I
don't know because I did so much stuffff
and I think at the moment that I was
when I did it it worked and maybe now it
wouldn't right uh I really like not
loocking a strategy versus the solver
and see how he plays against it uh I
think that's really useful
um yeah I think not loing is is kind of
useful because
you try
and it's like you try to learn the
reactions of the solvers uh right if you
this happen s like you you're trying to
learn the conditional like if this
happens then the Sol adjust this ways so
after a couple of tries you can see in
the way that that it will be adjusting
but this is is kind of dangerous or
problematic because there's a lot of
stuff that is going on that you have to
be careful with right because the SL is
adjusting on the River on the turn so if
you are looking at the Flop and you're
like oh this is this you kind of get the
logic of how the solver is thinking even
though it's not but like you kind of get
gets in the direction and it starts
changing or adjusting but you you have
to realize that he's compensating on
later streets so I think it's a tough
and I think tools will probably get
better as as the years progress in that
regard but um but yeah I think those two
are are good spots and I think also uh
flopzilla I think it's a very good tool
and I think all the the Spanish poker
crew uses a lot and I think it's not bad
uh to to mess with that a little bit uh
because I think it trains your intuition
very well in what's your opponent's
range trains it in terms of like how
much yeah what's your opponent range
that means you can probably calculate or
estimate how much your hand is worth
like what's your Equity of your hand uh
so I think that's also pretty nice to
like mess with the fsil a little bit
it's interesting because obviously you
know you can see the range as well in
the solver but because the solver
already shows you the strategy that's
what you focus on I think what flopzilla
forces you to do it forces you to think
more in terms of uh range interaction
and because that doesn't show you the
strategy it forces you to think whereas
the solver kind of feeds you the
information which is not which which
then you forget about actually looking
at the range which PL Zilla you know
it's all about looking at the range yeah
exactly and I think
it's Lilla is like the the OG like the
first
uh poer software like that I don't know
if people used to study but
like I I I would guess people would
study about what's my opponent's range
like what's my range so like something
similar to it uh at least is what people
probably used to first start to to study
with so I think it's and it's and I
think it's a little bit of an
unreplaceable stuff that you have to do
like realize uh how much top pair he has
in some spot or or like sets into pairs
that's usually driver of strategies this
thing that like influences all and you
kind of have to have an
idea yeah especially I would say
especially at River scenarios let's take
a River Bluff catch scenario I think
that's the easiest example just look at
the solver and say oh yeah my hand is a
frequency call you learned nothing
whereas if you just get a notepad out
and a calculator and be like let's start
counting Combos and be like well I have
to be right X percentage of the time
these are the combos that he has and
then throughout that exercise you will
start to recognize spots where it's like
oh wait it's quite easy for him to
overshoot the frequency here or in other
spots like we discussed earlier in the
pots oh even if I give him all his
Bluffs I have a break even call so
probably you know and that's what kind
of mean right with training your
intuition yeah and then you go on the
turn and see W this the Bluffs that got
on the river were allowed to Bluff every
time but then you go to the turn and you
see that all of the strangers are
betting just 20% of the time so like
well what you know what uh what are the
chances that this guy is only betting
them 20% so now all of a sudden the
river range might not be realistic so
you have to adjust and compensate for
that another actually that I forgot to
say another way I really like studing or
understanding a concept very deep is
like toy game I think it's really nice
and interesting and I think some people
I mean it's some people just don't give
a [ __ ] about them because it's just like
not really applicable but I think I
really like them I think is Rel for
understanding or explaining a concept in
terms of like many spots in poker so
actually I really like Ming or knowing
them and maybe you know yeah showing
them to a friend or whatever and yeah I
think that's really like the theory of
the game I think I'm very very
interested in and I think uh it's really
yeah fabulous and and very very I think
what a toy game a toy game allows or
forces you to think about the mechanics
of a certain spot whereas if you just
actually look at the spot
it kind
of you kind of lean towards more just
copying it what you take away from it is
different any any toy game that's that
stands
out uh I don't know
like I've watched coule but like
basically
the there's a couple like for example
why would why can you just yeah I don't
remember specifically right now but like
explaining why maybe you you you split
the size on the river or how the range
how you everything in in the so work so
that a sizeing protects another sizing
uh I think those kinds of stuff that
teaches you the stuff that you take for
granted when you see a Sol R of course
you're using to size of course you have
to protect well but why um you know why
why do you need your range protected
right at certain spot and the reason is
to prevent the other guy for like if
your range is always like super cup the
other guy would just sh every hand is
better than yours for Value so that
would allow him to like Bluff a [ __ ] ton
like if if your range is only you know
top pair only the guy well top pair is
really strong you know but if your range
is really top pair good kicker is the
best hand you have and you can grab Ace
King to and just shove it and then
there's going to be he's going to be
able to Bluff you know 10% more of his
range so that means that you get into a
z e spots way more frequent so your
whole range EV drops so
uh once you understand that uh that's
why it's it's important to like RNG and
trap the nuts some percentage of the
time uh if yeah if the guy's not going
to do that then you don't need to do it
so I think understanding those mechanics
of fundamentals of the game uh it's
really good so it sounds like basically
if I kind of summarize I think you
mentioned note locking flopzilla and toy
games which all have nothing to do with
just what I think most players do which
is open the S and try to figure out okay
what do I do in this spot you know like
more more like actual copying it sounds
like or that's kind of my main take away
from how how you study you're really
trying to figure out how the game works
and you try to kind of test out
different ways and are curious and
creative in game to applying various uh
various strategies and kind of see from
there kind of build your own strategy in
terms of that you think is high as e
based on everything that you now know of
the solare but it has nothing to do with
copying the solare am I right yeah I
mean at some point you have to learn
like like some some structure or like
some you have to have some some of the
Soler strategies in mind like the the
like copy it a little bit in order to
just not
spend like 30 seconds to see with the
three B right like you want to know that
some spots arrange but and SPS are you
bet like some stuff you know just by
heart because it's just more efficient
like it's not that you you get to play
just one table um but yeah once you I
mean those are the common spots and
everyone who plays and studies this
amount probably kind of knows what is up
but yeah I think just I think it's
important to know a lot of stuff like
how like messing around with the solver
is really like if you okay let's give it
a small size see how you react now give
it a big size how the River Pro
situation changes after a big size after
a small size of flop uh and and why and
the reason is how you play the turn so a
lot of stuff understanding how a small
change really impacts and the polarity
and everything so I think that's I think
that's the best way to like really
understand and then you will be able to
like come up with a decent strategy your
own in game
um very uh very good stuff I think a lot
of good takeaways uh for our audience
here I was wondering when making
decisions at the tables
what are for you the most important
things that you take away take in
consideration when you make a decision
what is something you think a lot of
players put way too much weight upon
when making a
decision uh that's a good
question I think thinking about the
opponent's range and tendencies is is
important uh and then how he perceives
you uh and then
I
think and I think
people usually I think looking at the
other guys range is something that
people sometimes don't do uh like you
know I call because I have this or that
blocker yeah but what what are the hands
that you're Bluff catching but like what
is he bluffing under the gun versus big
plan SP a king
queening she is like how she is doing
pocket trees all the way like I think
you know that like some people just oh I
have a block cow which I have to call X
percentage of the time My Block C is
like I don't know some people just
sometimes Focus too much on their own
game and not not thinking enough about
the other guys game uh about the other
guys range but I also see the other the
the reverse like the guys that just try
and like if your range is C they will
just bet small with value and big as a
block and just basically they're just
targeting your range uh so I think yeah
there's there's a both sides but I
think it's important to think about the
other guys range pretty
much I can uh I can I can definitely
relate this kind of the consequence of
too much solver work where we're
constantly trying to think of what do I
have to do what I have to have to do I
have to do and you're only thinking
about your range your frequencies
whereas like at some point you know
maybe look up from the table look at
your opponent and be like huh he's never
bluffing then the the conclusion is
quite simple sometimes doesn't make it
too complex and then there's a
discussion about the right blocker the
wrong blocker whereas the most important
thing is like well is the Spot close
enough for this blocker to actually make
the difference between the plus v or
minus V call and I think there's
something that um you have to be careful
even when if you focus only on your
strategy uh whereas like you can make
frequency mistakes right is okay you're
not going to lose EV in theory but the
problem is is like if you make mistakes
that lean towards a specific way of
making a mistake that is what the other
guy can predict I don't know if this
makes sense then he could accidentally
exploit You by by his game plan so like
so you know what I mean like I I don't
know if I maybe you can give an
example
um if
you there's some mistakes that in theory
don't cost anything thing because but
like like if I give up a bluff that ZB
in a certain spot uh is that I should
Bluff every time or like all most of the
time it's probably I don't lcyb but if
it's a spot that people probably don't
expect you to have a bluff so you're
just EX deviating in the in a in a way
that is kind of predictable by your
opponent then you you are exploiting
yourself even though you're just playing
your own game right and you just made
you just made no a be mistake but you
actually are because so I
think yeah it's kind of like in that in
that example maybe it's important to to
have Bluffs in in certain spots because
if not and when you're playing good
players and that have been around for
for some time they they will they will
stop calling you down in spots if if you
just don't show up with Bluffs and so so
yeah that's
that's scenario I think uh
you have to be careful with with that
mindset of like I just play I just do at
Le at best it's a frequency mistake well
but if you're frequency you're deviating
and your opponent is probably defaulting
to that then you're are going to get
exploited think it links nicely back to
what you said in the beginning that
there's some truths that you might not
want to believe is true so you come up
with excuse well you know I could Bluff
this could not Bluff this you know it's
zero EV in the solver and you can just
hide the fact that you know you have
maybe a tendency to get up and if you
suddenly start under bluffing in a spot
that's overfolded maybe by population
then it's not so zero e in hindsight so
like you're getting accidentally
exploited exactly right if you if you if
you play unbalanced strategy that
accidentally the pool uh does kind of
the opposite uh very well I was
wondering in terms of in terms of uh
studying what areas do you believe are
most crucial for players to study like
where do you you think most of the EV
comes
from I guess it depends in what stage of
your of your poker Journey you are
really um yeah I think it it depends a
little bit on that right because maybe
our audience maybe our audience you know
maybe like a lot of I guess midst
striving
professionals I think just having a a
strategy uh I think just like maximizing
versus recreational is important um and
then you know having a default strategy
that you can just when you don't know
what to do I I don't know this guy what
do I do just having a decent strategy
there uh not too complicated it's a good
place to start and then go from there
and then yeah being and I think being
being able to adjust once you see a
showdown a stat that after a couple of
hands you played like couple thousand
hands you played you can say well he's
doing this Pro probably wrong so how do
I exploit it you know and then maybe
deeper down going into deeper exploits
like I was about earlier just multi
Street explo like because yeah and then
s yeah adjusting to the situation
adjusting where there's a recreational
and then yeah having a being able to
also play a solid simple Strat uh when
you don't know what to to do or exploit
I think those are good starting points
once you got that covered maybe you can
try and do something else yeah I think
that's good and of course the mental
part I think that that's good advice
like to actually go in have at least
some sort of idea of let's say a
defensive Baseline strategy I think
where it kind of where people get kind
of stuck is that they don't evolve to
what you're saying that from that to to
kind of say what what Chris said in the
other episode from that you know you
have a pece of Mind from that you can
start to look at all the possibilities
but what I think often goes wrong is
that players stay in like this defensive
Baseline and they try to Perfection IE
their defensive Baseline and never look
for the further possibilities where you
know I think like perfectionism and
really wanted to be fully Bulletproof
that's kind of I think where you're
taken it a little bit too far and you
knowbly like you said look up to your
opponents and and look for the
opportunity and like six Max is just
like a such a like complex and then
there's a lot of spots you cannot aim
for
Perfection
uh so it's hard to to have that mindset
you needs to like at at some point go
like you need to be yeah sometimes being
really decent in a lot of spots is much
better than being really good at two
spots and suck at other spots yeah but
poker is not about uh playing everything
perfect it's about sucking a little bit
than your opponents yeah ex and not
punting and and not punting let's let's
let's inde not forget about that one
Adam why do people uh get to
perfectionistic and what can they do to
overcome
perfectionism that's a good question I
think it's the need for certainty and
they Allure that they can get to a level
where they can predict the outcomes and
the more you seek for certainty the more
you seek like a Perfection sorry the
more you seek that Clarity of I am going
to get a result I want and I think the
the fear is if they don't play Perfect
they won't win they won't get the
results they want people exploit them so
they take the extreme of one uncertainty
and also wanting to win to an extreme I
think like perfectionism is one of those
things where I think often we can we can
class things as perfectionism when
they're not so like when someone's
trying to get better and obsessing over
learning they might not necessarily be a
perfectionist it's someone who's like
their STS are too too high they've
almost got this like the bar is like I
can't do anything wrong I class that is
perfectionist but yeah it's often that
kind of the fear of making a mistake and
potentially not getting the results they
want and trying to the mind trying to
cling on to certainty in an uncertain
world full of chaos it's like I want
predictability but there's no
predicability around and I think that's
when people can push that um yeah push
perfectionism too far yeah I think I
think throughout this conversation Mato
has been
very what what I've noticed like he
Embraces uncertainty a lot instead of
fighting it I think something that the
perfectionist like you said strive
towards certainty in an uncertain word I
think Mato so far has shown that he
likes to just embrace it and he's very
realistic right he also said like yeah
okay you know I I I throw out a few puns
here and there as part of the win raate
you know and he accepts reality and I
feel like perfectionists probably have a
tendency to not accept reality and to
not Embrace uncertainty does that sound
about right very true yeah and also like
the relationship where mistakes is
different because a mistake can be a
learn opportunity whereas for a
perfectionist that that's like a gr in I
failed I didn't do well enough today so
I think it's like that light-hearted
nature of I'm going to mess up I'm going
to make mistakes I accept that and I
will learn from it and move on and I
think yeah if you push perfectionism too
far they yeah it's painful to uh to not
live up to your St except for yourself
so I think is definitely not in that
camp to the extremes at least um to I
think also like like um you have to
accept that you have limited mental
bandwidth you're playing four or five or
six or seven tables at at a given moment
and your attention is limited and I I
don't know if it ever happened to you
but like if you ever spend like a week
or like starting a very specific spot
let's say you were studying blind V
blind seing or stabbing in certain
boards um I do notice that when I do
that in that type of ingame or depth
study uh like about a specific spot in
the game
um I play worse after because my mind is
just focusing on like oh I want to get
this spot right oh the king queen board
blind be blind time to show what I
learned and you stop thinking about
exploits the other gu range the GU guy
just Falls blind be blind 60% so his
ranges like under the gun and you're
just like seeing everything so your your
brain it logically is trying to apply
just focusing on the one thing compared
to your usual Focus which is multi you
know layered and thinking a lot of stuff
so I think there's it's very common that
you lose
EV just after signing and I think if
you're a perfectionist I think you're
just not you're just focus too much on
getting your strategy right uh in terms
of playing what like the whole game what
what the whole game is this about which
is a mixture of your strategy your
opponent's
strategy uh future mistakes you or him
can make making it easier for you just
not getting to like an awkward spot like
you know getting I don't know so I think
that's something that also is is have to
be careful and I have experienced myself
about after like diving deep into a
configuration going to the game and
saying like oh I'm worse than than
before what the [ __ ] yeah great example
I think it shows like often when you're
that perfectionist mindset it's the
mindset let's get things right let's not
make a mistake or get things wrong and
as you mentioned like that almost like
robs you of creativity and robs you of
like the bigger picture CU you're so
focused on like the small of remembering
how to do a strategy correct rather than
like all right there's all sorts going
on there's all sorts of information like
let's let's play that's and I I think
actually let's not make a mistake even
though it's negative and you should it's
a better mindset than let's get it
perfect because let's not make a mistake
leades you a lot of leage just don't
[ __ ] up it's a good like strategy or a
better than like get make the best play
the absolute best play puts more
pressure and like probably spend too
much thinking about stuff that don't
really even matter yeah I think the kind
of the main kind of driving point after
this is when when you make a mistake
what happens next I think that's when
perfectionists kind of go wrong because
they they make a mistake and it's like
all right now that I want to study that
spot for the next five hours to like so
don't do it again it's just like this
really uh just almost too serious
relationship with the the outcomes so
yeah I think it's a yeah I think we
covered in a lot of deep there which was
really good all right I want to do a bit
of reflecting on your career but I want
to do from a slightly different angle to
usual and I want to talk about your kind
of self-improvements through poker so I
want to just touch on the version of you
right now and the kind of the character
traits you had to develop to become who
you are now compared to who you started
so um looking back on yourself three
four years ago getting into poker what
would you say you're most proud of of
the character traits you've had to
develop on on your poker
Journey uh I don't know if this is the
one I'm most proud but I have I did I do
realize that I've always been like a
person like I think like I didn't
usually believe in all the meditation
stuff I thought it's like a little bit
[ __ ] and I did have to accept that
you know that sort of accept that sort
of like spirituality to the
game uh that I think is necessary in in
in in a in a discipline where it's the
your mental state is so important being
to the not the 100% because it's very
hard but being at the top of your game
in terms of your your ability to to to
perform is so important that you need to
be like do all those you know write the
journal meditate you know all that stuff
that I always being blew
off doesn't matter I actually change a
little bit and embrace it more which is
like to my friends and people that know
me know it's really unlike me I always
being like like a you know yeah not very
modern in that spot so I I've I've I've
improved in that scenario been very open
to to lines or schools of thoughts about
spir spirituality that I would always
previously have dismiss and left of so
so I think that's a growth in that
regard about myself and
then I've
also yeah I also like became a little
bit very like honest with myself and and
a bit more driven and and and
disciplined even even though I I am
messy these days but I think I was much
more
before
um and yeah uh I cannot think of more
but there may be some I don't
know what changed your mind with practic
like meditation I think you mentioned
like you noticed like you wanted your
mind in a good place you wanted to
perform at high level so you had to be a
bit more open-minded to uh to new ideas
but often it's when we've got like a bit
of a fixed mindset around topics it's
very hard to like change our mind so
what was the the kind of bridge that
allowed you to uh Embrace different
concepts I don't know I just try it like
I'm open-minded at first but quick to
dismiss it but when I try so I tried a
lot of that stuff and then when it
worked or like I felt better I like oh
I's should continue to do it right so I
think yeah I just tried it it worked or
I felt better uh some positive Loop
reinforcement maybe just run well after
a session of doing that and you're like
well let's try it again and then try
again and then you know it kind of stick
stuck and then all of a sudden it's part
of your routine or you just like to it
uh but also understanding and like
getting into talking a lot about like I
think there something I just left out is
like talking a lot about not only
strategy but with your friends or your
your your poker Circle just talking
about like how do you feel how do you
feel about in the down swing uh talking
about your feelings and like yeah oh you
do that too oh yeah we're we're [ __ ]
we need to improve yeah okay and so then
just seeing that you're not alone and
thinking well this is hard in so many
levels compared to maybe a reg job it
has his benefits it has his his non
benefits
so being being realizing that you need
to dig deep and there's like less room
for a mistake like think about it like
in in most jobs you can just show up and
you will get paid maybe in two years
from now from now you won't get the
promotion because that guy worked harder
but you will still get paid if you show
up after going to a party whatever you
will just you know you will perform
maybe they tell you they they they they
I don't know they tell you you bro you
cannot do that but at the end of the day
you get paid but here you cannot show up
unprepared or not ready because you just
get smoked and you and you you will be
like you will be really living uh you it
won't be nice like you have to show up
yeah you have to like per you have to
perform and that's I think
that's compar only maybe to sports play
people that play sports Ro living like
whatever way you're you're playing today
this year is going to reflect on the
contract you get next year so whatever
how you show up to play your sessions
this month is going to impact the the
winning the the balance at the end of
the month so you better like do
everything in your power to be the best
you can be and I think that's that's
pressure but also that instigates you
and like motivates you to I don't know
like read books about how to be better
and all of that stuff that usually it's
not that important maybe in other
aspects or you maybe ignore it a bit
more yeah I like that framing there of
performance rather than showing up and
not many things do you have to always be
switched on and perform at your best
like you mentioned Sports probably very
similar analogy but poker is like the
ultimate version because not only will
you not get paids you'll lose money
you'll get like ex repercussion so yeah
I think the the incentives to want to
perform well are higher and as you
mentioned like from your peer group it
sounds like you were having
conversations around what other people
are doing I think often like when we
hear other players are doing similar
practices or doing things like ah cool
that could work it opens our mind to try
it and then once you get that sample
size and experience that ah this works
for me then you start doing it more I
think everything every habit routine you
can think of it works for some people
doesn't work for others so you've got it
very very experimental with your kind of
approaches and you're right I'll give it
a try I'm openminded it works it doesn't
and I think something good about or
pretty good about poker players is like
since it's such a
unique Niche like not all of people and
it's very hard for someone outside of
the game to understand what you're going
through or whatever or like what's are
the like swings or the mentals St how
impacts you uh whenever you find someone
in the similar situation uh like I'm
sure every opponent I play regularly on
the tables and if I ever saw him as a
live table or whatever I would just be
very happy to get a beer with of course
because you can just talk about share so
many stuff that other people will be
kind of hard for them to understand that
at the end of the day I think the poker
Community most of it anyways is really
like friendly towards each other because
you kind of know the guy is going
through in the at the end of the days
for some through something very similar
than you so I think that's pretty nice
and and whenever you get to talking you
get like I always it's kind of hard to
find a high stakes reg uh that is really
uninteresting what like you you're not
interesting in what he says or how he he
got there I think it's it's like because
they they they they are usually very
well developed in other areas of their
lives and can can give you a lot of
interesting information or insights
because they just in order to get there
you have to there's no other way I
think yeah I like that like you got to
almost level up your character to uh to
get to those higher levels because it's
so brutal to uh to go through all the
the kind of trials and tribulations and
yeah I think as well like a lot of
players who struggle can get a little
bit isolated and feel like they're the
only person going for problems they're
the only one on the downswing I know
like online Grinders who just grind
alone in the bedroom can definitely be
guilty of that and yeah I think having
conversations in a peer group where
you're like look like we're all going
through some tough times we're all going
through down swings we all have
self-doubt it's normal it's probably
being a poget player welcome to the game
I think it's very reassuring for yeah a
lot of players on their Journey so I
want to double down on something Circle
backround you mentioned being honest
with yourself that's another thing that
in yourself development talk me through
like the challenges you've had with this
because I always feel like when you're
being honest with yourself it's often
getting the parts of yourself that you
don't like to the surface admitting your
your kind of fail failed Parts the
things that like that are on fireing in
the right way and then come to terms
with them and like making improvements
but this is often hard people because
you've got to accept that you're not
quite good enough yet or not quite where
you want to be so um being honest with
yourself talk us through uh where that's
LED
you I think um first of all I think
being the the the a good
good um trigger for you to be honest is
realizing if you if you are where you
are which is not that bad after all in
terms of percentile whatever state
you're playing if you're playing 1kl or
500L which is pretty high up in the
ladder anyways if it's not the top
um if you have a lot of mistakes and you
got there despite of the mistakes then
all of a sudden well that just means
you're doing some [ __ ] really good and
then that just means you probably can't
improve so so I think Honesty or or or
like a knowledging that you're doing
stuff wrong is actually positive in some
regard unless you're just broke in that
case well maybe you need to improve a a
bit more but you know so I think in that
sense it's it's it's
liberating I also I also remember like
maybe when I said back in the earlier
that I maybe I should have tried harder
in in terms of basketball for example I
think I I I came to terms with the fact
that I sometimes do not try hard enough
in some spots or procrastinate or
something because um it's very
comfortable to look back into something
you did and say and have the peace of
mind uh of that you didn't try hard
enough so it's not that you weren't as
good it's just you didn't try hard
enough so not trying hard enough is a
good
excuse uh but if you because if you go
all in and you fail you have to face the
inevitable inevitable truth that you
sacked or you just were not good enough
but you know competitive as one as I am
you suck so and it's fine you cannot be
good at anything uh so but like so I
think for example not trying being
honest with myself is a lot of my past
stuff that I did I didn't just go all in
I just I tried okay decently hard but
through according to my standards I I
just didn't try 100% or 95 and I think
that might have been one of the reasons
why so trying to not do that again is
been a challenge and still is so I think
that
driving diving into like your past
behavior and stuff and why you do it and
how to fix it I think that's why I mean
like being honest with yourself is
important yeah that's a very interesting
one as well where you mentioned if you
don't put all the effort in and try your
hardest you've got the kind of get out
of jail free card of oh well if I try
harder I could got got a success but
also those are the ones that lead to the
most regret like as you mentioned you
look back in your basketball career
you're like I could have tried harder
not not necessarily have got to where
you wanted to be but you're like I know
I didn't put it on the line and I think
as you get older that becomes way more
of a regress the things that you didn't
put more effort into but some people as
you mentioned like hold on to this like
not not going full in I think I speak
players all the time who uh have this
kind of I don't want to fully commit I
don't want to be vulnerable to fail at
this if I go all if I go all out so for
but you like you mentioned basketball
you didn't do this but with poker you
did what was it like to one maybe have
to confront the fact that you wouldn't
be good enough would you didn't have to
do with basketball because maybe had the
little bit I could do more what was it
like in POG when you actually decided
you know what this is me if I fail I
fail I'm I'm willing to take
that
well I mean I think once you got to a
certain level you're like well I'm doing
pretty well like it's not that easy to
get here so I think I'm like sometimes
being
like conformist like being I don't know
how to say like the word just live but
like I know getting to a certain point
being enough like not being yeah I want
to get to the G to get to the top but
sometimes you're like well this is not a
bad spot to be you can make a lot of
money much more than I could probably
would have done playing basketball
that's for sure uh but like also maybe
in a career in Argentina at least so you
know like I could have a like I I can
like I don't know like be a live a
comfortable life
ER it's not that bad right so and if I
don't don't make the top then you know
it's going to be sad but like the
reality is the top is the top not
everyone can make it if everyone could
make it to the top the top would be like
like this super big right so at the end
of the day I
think it will come it will become the
time to accept that you're your ceiling
and I think it's you just do it I think
it's
there's only one liners right there's
only I don't know who the guy you think
you guys think but the best player the
top three there's only three there's not
they going to be 300 right so you can
and and also the thing in poker which is
and that that is some some of the stuff
that I've been realizing
lately uh the amount of money that the
first the top guy can do compared to the
third one it's not even but like in
terms of money it just doesn't matter
like maybe in terms of what Glory but
like the if you have access to the same
games you probably make the same amount
of money so and at the end of the day
yeah it's not yeah it's just egoo maybe
which is fine but like
it's do you feel like you needed to get
to a certain level before you uh could
have that kind of honest acceptance
because it feels like as you mentioned
as you're going through that maturity
you realize that not everyone get the
top and it kind of being honest way your
CE May lie but also like kind of going
all in and go right I'm not going to cut
myself I'm just going to see how far can
go but as we've talked about that's not
everyone's reality most people struggle
with that because they don't want to
confront that so for you I'm wondering
did you have to have this honest
confrontation with the where your limits
lie or what level did you get to where
you're like you know what like I've kind
of satisfied the ego I feel like I'm
kind of happy with where I've got to and
then you could actually just push on and
play more freely I mean I'm not exactly
saying that I'm happy where I got to but
like if if I I I kind of like can
project myself or like see myself
looking back uh in a couple years and
saying let's say I get like this is my
ceiling where I'm at now I was like well
it ain't that bad
right and and like I also know that I
really work really hard and that that
gives me peace of mind so that's yeah
that's what's your current definition of
success that's a hard question actually
I don't
know I don't really
know um you can look back on your life
when you're 80 years old and you can
look back on a life well lived and you
go you know what I'm pretty happy with
that life I I lived out there what would
be some of the things that would would
come to mind
there well that's a very tough question
but like yeah at least doing what you're
what you wanted to do uh being like
having a lot of happy moments being able
to be free which is something poker
really helps with especially on like a
third world country like like Argentina
or like uh that you yeah so I think
those those are good spots to start with
uh and yeah
um I think success is like getting to
like a decent amount of top percent of
of players and you know being and
enjoying the process till that got you
there as well as the the actual part of
it playing so I think both those two
things are are kind of like that and and
I mean certain potential because like
you have to draw a line at some point
but I know getting decent at the game
basically is what what I mean and and
everyone can draw the line whatever they
they they feel like it's just like a
matter of like what's your like aim or
whatever and and yeah and also like in
the future learning other games or other
formats and being DEC those as well is
also kind of
like I think that would would imply that
you're successful because you can adapt
you can like you're you're still good at
learning new stuff you know you're
probably older and so
yeah yeah I think there's also like two
metrics one's like an external metric of
success and the other one's an internal
metric like the happiness the kind of
Freedom you've got and if you have the
external without the internal you're
always going to be unfulfilled I think
the internal without the external we
could still argue that's a pretty
successful life if you're kind of happy
fulfilled you live a life in your own
terms yeah it's obviously a challenging
one because the goal post move in terms
of what you're trying to achieve and
often we link achievement success
especially through certain chapters but
yeah I think you've covered a lot of the
main components that out class is like
the the main things around success all
right so final question from me what has
been the best investment you have made
in your poker career this could be a
coaching program and anything that comes
to mind in terms of a best
investment to be completely honest in
terms of Return of of
Roi like probably the first course I
bought the guy at his home for like
$20 uh that prompt me into starting
having something to study during the
pandemic I me I guess that's that's the
highest Roi
um I guess like to be honest like you
have to be 100% honest and maybe he I I
don't know if he will watch it but like
the Spanish coach I mentioned that like
completely changed my mind about playing
versus fish I mean that just paid I
don't know $500 for that and just apply
that into like never ending and stuff so
I think that has to be it um and yeah I
think also like uh getting into the mind
of recreational or like sharing and
being I think it it's really well good
for other
disciplines in like for example playing
live for example which I do enjoy a lot
and I think I don't know if a lot
because it's maybe tedious but I think
it's it's interesting on its own and
it's a different beast and you have to
be ready there there's some adjustment
you have to make and like uh but getting
into how people think is is a good uh
thing for
example uh yeah yeah I think often those
early Investments because of the
compounding effect and how they open up
doors can have like so much of a higher
weai in because yeah they almost like
the Domino that knocks everything else
over which yeah all right Ren for you
any Investments you made early in your
career that have had a dis proportional
compounding effect on your later career
I think the best investment that I made
in my poker career very likely coaching
related probably mental game coaching I
think I've puted a lot of uh a lot of
dollars in that both working with Jared
uh working with Elliot Row I Remember
that was a very good investment working
with Adam more a bit more nowadays uh I
think that for
me has had definitely the highest return
of investment guess also investing in
like an office space where I where I
could share share like a same similar
environment with other players and kind
of if we can call that an investment you
know but obviously yeah you you already
have your rent and you I think I was
paying like what 800 EUR a month or
something uh for a nice offers with with
the guys I think there was definitely
also a very very good investment um I
wanted to ask uh Mato some final
questions before uh before we let him go
he's already shared enough wisdom with
us uh what is the thing in poker you
remain to have the most trouble with
what is the hardest thing about being a
poker
player um I think for me nowadays uh
maybe getting into a consistent routine
I think my my routine should shifts
constantly uh I'm not very defined in
that spot mainly because like I don't
have like a I don't have a family sort
so that just makes you be more free in
that sense and I'm already very messy in
terms of maybe I go to sleep late I
decide to play a session late so I think
that's you know yeah my my schedule is
constantly changing sometimes so I think
that's something I do struggle with and
I think I would love like to improve uh
because I think consistency is a little
bit better I also think that for example
whenever
you sometimes you don't plan to play a
session and then you open the lobby and
see oh okay there's like a table going
which is seems nice I'll sit and for
some reason and I think I don't know
what it would be the best remedy to that
but like if you if I end up playing a
session I did not plan to I do get much
more regret like the fish regret or I
should have gone to sleep I would have
saved that amount of money that I lost
and you know that in EV I did not lost
that money that session I play even if I
play slightly worse I was poly winning
money and if I was just playing so but I
was losing I just lost whatever I like
my my EB was which is cannot be about a
very big number but I do get that regret
like a fish would would say oh why did I
go went to the casino why did I went to
the roulette before leaving you know I
get that regret much more often when I
play a session I would not set up to
play whereas if you like do your routine
and play your session at the time you're
supposed to play and you lose you're
like well you know I'm a professional
what I play what am I going to do so I
think struggle into that and I think to
to be honest I think the the solution is
not to not play at that spot I think
this if you want to be like a high
stakes regular I think the solution is
to just don't have that regret after
because I think the when you have when
you get when you're targeting when
you're wishing to play a very selected
game um like states that don't run very
often whenever they run you have to make
room for yourself and I think something
I also would like to to improve going
forward is uh being able to to improve
my B Toc game because if you get like a
very good spot you might may have to
play for like a very like long session
so actually even though like we're
always focusing on improving our aame
the reality is that if you want to like
I don't know play like some you have to
play like six hours of a very good table
because that spot is really big in terms
of your of your monthly or even yearly e
um
then you really want to have your your b
game uh or to to a very high standard
and also know like hey when I'm tired I
tend to start doing this [ __ ] wrongly so
I'm GNA try and like not not be
ambitious and not try and
like be like accept your in b game and
accept there stuff I cannot do and if
you maybe a hand that you defend verus
three that is mixed maybe you can fold
it because the guy just sat down half an
hour and you're playing for 4 hours so
he's going to be brighter than him he's
going to be brighter than you right at
this at this point in time so you
probably can just you know give a at 0a0
one e spot go because you're not going
to be able to maximize that EV at that
at the point in time so I think those
kinds of stuff I think is I think it's
more like the solution not not just not
playing uh yeah once you play higher and
higher at some point it's like part of
the job is more you're just being around
your computer and ready for whenever it
kicks off I remember I had I of problems
or at least trouble with that as well at
some point I I I realized that I would
just always quit my session I think it
was 6 p.m. you know I would have like a
window from 5 to six if the games are
really good I would push it one more
hour but I at some point decided for
myself I don't care how good the game is
I would just quit at six like for me it
was just not worth like breaking my rout
playing two three hours longer then
being tilted that influencing my grind
the next day I just calculated like okay
how much can really making that extra
two hours is it really worth screwing up
like my my schedule and influencing it
the next day but I also know for example
some other friend of mine he he kind of
made some rules like okay if my EV is
greater than a I'll play and if I play
longer than three hours I'll take the
next day off because it already has
compensated or and that that's kind of
how would balance it and I think to be
like this is where being honest with
yourself count and I think you have to
be honest with yourself and look
yourself in the mirror and say well you
know my e here like this is how how much
of a unique spot is this right uh and
sometimes like yes it's a good spot you
get have one recreational but sometimes
you have a huge whale that it just Worth
to stay six hours or whatever uh can
deep stack so I think deep down after
the years of playing you kind of know uh
how yeah y be you can estimate it and I
think it's a good skill like like the
George mentioned on his podcast so I
think that's a big thing like wait
waiting the pros and con and like you
say the next day you're probably not
going to be able to to to function very
well and also if you lose a lot of money
which you know is within the Realms of
what can happen even though in you won't
you will be like maybe oh maybe I should
since you did something extra or
routinely right something that you don't
usually do you will feel a little bit
more guilt so that probably makes you if
you if you know if you if you take a
shot at a game that when you run bad H
just means you have to take two weeks
off because you're tilted then the EV of
that shot suddenly drops because there's
a percentage of the time you just don't
win money for two two weeks right so
yeah putting all that into the and and
I've heard this as a trend throughout
conversation as well it's kind of taking
yourself and kind of the human aspect in
consideration when calculating your EV I
think you talked in some earlier in this
podcast as well like oh yeah this is
more plus v well is it really if you
take in consideration you and the impact
that it's gonna have on you same what
you said I remember in those times if I
would push longer or play more tables
than I would normally before that I
would try to make concept like okay I'm
doing something that I'm not used to be
aware BC game mistakes will show up and
that's okay if I kind of align those
expectations
then I'm okay with it if I don't and
have unrealistic expectations play two
hours longer and then make stupid seame
mistake I'm tilted why did I continue
play blah blah blah I should have just
stick to my SCH yeah it's like a it's
like a slippery
slope totally totally I think a
knowledging that's why you have to be
honest P SL look I mean c game here I'm
only here staying because of that guy
and that guy maybe whatever the rest of
it I don't care like and like guess it's
kind of hard because your usual mindset
my usual mindset is not that right it's
the opposite of that but like you have
to be flexible I think you have to adapt
I think that's the skill that as a poker
player you have to there's no other way
I know you uh as a very skilled cash
game player in the background I see uh I
believe that's a scoop to Trophy W CP
trophy uh yeah yeah what's up with that
you play tournaments as well you you
know how to
play no the this is um no I just I just
played like some friends started playing
uh I think during scop I I I don't know
why I don't remember why but I played a
couple of turn I think yeah I think I
actually bought a piece of a friend uh
playing at the mon Carlo and he make a
deep run it was so fun because I would
in like all I would wake up in the
morning see oh it is 30 like I was
visualized my 10% of that tournament
going to Big so I was so it's really fun
to sweat so after that I know I just
like a couple of Sundays I play
tournament I think it was exactly during
scoop and I of black box myself into
binking one one tournament uh but like
yeah they got the trophy which is really
sweet H they shipped it to my house
that's pretty pretty awesome but yeah
not I would like to to stay tournaments
uh but I think it just has to wait a
little bit um I'm going to Barcelona now
to to visit a friend and play the the EP
but but yeah I'm not a tournament player
whatsoever nor plan to be in the future
in the near future I think was guy I was
going to ask like how do you see the
future of Poker and how do you see
yourself in it so you're not going to
transition to mtts anytime
soon uh I mean transition is a big word
I think right uh because like it would
require but like I think maybe getting
into a spot where you kind of know the
basics and like don't make like ICM puns
or like huge puns and being able to play
I know the tournament series or like the
goody be spots like the best ones maybe
it's okay uh to to like dedicate like a
month to to study the basics and then
become like decent uh I think compounded
with a with a cash game knowledge could
be enough to like uh win some but like I
think like in every in every discipline
if you want to like my hour is GNA
always be be better playing cash games
unless cash Games die or whatever but
like I think so so it would be like
pretty much a pun to go very very deep
into tournaments but I don't know then I
see again I see a lot of the high States
players playing the cash games one
playing tournament so you know some you
never
know what would you like uh the main
takeaway for our audience to be from the
conversation that we had
today
um I don't know
um just that
maybe
uh that love and passion for the game is
comes com a long way if you execute it
and then
probably just don't be too hard on
yourselves uh and just keep working I
guess just don't yeah don't be don't be
too mean on yourselves I guess like I I
used to be maybe I don't know and I
think I don't know I think it depends
like I wouldn't say you have to be
competitive because it's just that how
how it works for me and and it just
works for me but doesn't mean it doesn't
mean it will be the same for everyone
else I I don't think uh and I and I I
have to to go through my struggles uh
because of that and like toning the
competition down and I did I did some
work with a mental game coach and it did
help me so I think ER everyone has their
own like I think maybe the the a good
takeaway is like be ready to look
yourself to look at yourself deeply
within and like see what are your flaws
what are your good parts and build from
there like fix the flaws go around them
if you can't and potentiate that's not
word like like build upon this good
things that you're that you do and like
like push push those so I think yeah be
ready to to look yourself in the mirror
because and yeah and you're probably not
going to be that pretty at the beginning
but this thing is helpful and it's
helpful for for every aspects of life I
think that's why I think and I'm being a
little bit maybe like what the [ __ ] do I
know right but like I think once you if
you are a successful poker players
there's a lot of stuff that you can do
other than poker because you just over
overcame a lot of hardles in your in
your previous job basically you just
that that I think allows you or prepares
you to do I'm not going to say anything
because that's not true but like a lot
of things so I think you can be happy
about
yourself thank you mat for sharing your
wisdom on this pot was a great episode
Adam what are your main takeaways of our
conversation
today well yeah very good conversation I
really enjoyed the competitive spirit
that was coming out of Mato throughout
the conversation and I do feel like that
was one of his strengths in terms of
turning that competitive fuel that he
had from his basketball from Sports into
poker and he mentioned in very
interesting ways how he had to channel
that kind of aggression that he's
naturally got in a different way think
more strategically think more longterm
but he still got that kind of fire and
that kind of competitive nature to him
and even said at the end like it might
not transition to everybody else but for
him that's what kind of gets him going
and also I think that allows him to move
up Stakes more effectively or quicker
because like when you're competitive
rather than like trying to succeed in
the short term you're like okay let's
compete let's see what I've got when
need playing in tough lineups and play
tougher game so I think that's
definitely being a factor in his fast
rise another thing that was really
interesting was the the biases
conversation when he talked about like
understanding yourself and knowing what
your biases are especially when you're
in different emotional states you're in
different fatigue levels what are your
kind of tendencies
and understanding them and then where
how to deviate the opposite way you
mentioned like when you've got one
strong bias you often need to go far the
opposite way to kind of correct that
bias which I thought was really good
advice and sound like like throughout
the conversation he's done a lot of work
on building like awareness of his
Tendencies and how he shows up and then
being able to fix those things which I
think two different skill sets and you
can show with each of them one building
the awareness is challenging but then
once you find the awareness to actually
change a bias like me me R we talked
about this is for the conversation today
players can know the biases but not able
to change them still keep having at home
so I think with Mato he was able to use
the data that I've got a bias here and
to move past that and to use as a
learning experience to uh to get past
and then one of the final things which
was towards the end of the conversation
you man manag honest with yourself as a
is a real key lesson and that that's got
so many Avenues as I've thought about
that it's like you've got to be honest
with yourself in terms of where you're
currently at you got to be honest with
yourself in things terms of things you
don't know and you need to get better at
and it's this like ility to go right
like I'm trying to get better I'm
imperfect we touched on perfectionism a
little bit as well but I'm trying to get
better and I need to on the things I'm
not quite not quite good of at yet
because I'm in the process getting
better and he mentioned like a few
things he does for that but yeah I think
it's a a very good skill to uh be honest
with yourself to uh know where you're
currently at and where you can improve
and I think many players who uh struggle
to make progress to the higher levels
will often cap themselves with the
inability to confront themselves that
they don't like there's some really good
work by kle young old school
psychologist who talks about the Shadow
the shadow is like this uh s of self
that you don't like that you don't want
to bring to the light and I think Mata
was talking a lot about the how he's
brought his kind of character traits to
the to the surface and B been able to
work through the things that have held
them back so yeah really enjoyed the
conversation how about you read one the
main things you wrot down couple things
that uh stood out to me he at some point
he he mentioned when you know battling
against stronger players he said um look
for signs that they are human and Che on
that I really like it he said Che on
that you know you you look okay they're
probably very good but let me spot some
weaknesses that gives you just enough
like maybe a little bit fake confidence
but to at least hop in and then from
there you can actually build the true
confidence that you need in order to you
know move up the stakes uh and start
playing there so you know players
putting other players on a pedestal when
they move up I think such common problem
we hear it so often and I think this one
is really good analyze maybe the
population above you look for a couple
of General leaks that you can chew on
that gives you just enough confidence to
hop in and I think and Adam mentioned it
in many podcast as well the only way we
then actually build actual confidence is
putting repetition in at that higher
stake vers these tougher opponents but
this will allow you to kind of take that
leap of uh faith in the beginning and he
also said yeah we have to realize you
know that how good they are we all have
strengths and weaknesses them includ and
US included also in terms of realizing
that when you make a mistake it doesn't
mean that you're now a bad player right
he said yes I have weaknesses and
they're part of my win rate and I you
know don't give too much attention to it
right it doesn't now make me a bad
player uh we also talked a little bit
about changing a mindset from trying to
make the perfect play all the time and
going more from like an approach make
the play that can be bad uh I think this
is in general a great set of Mind from
which you can perform kind of hand in
hand with that he also talked Al about
Baseline strategies and simplification a
little bit um that it has its place but
from there we must look up to our
opponent and try to look for different
ways we can extract more value right I
think when I asked him what is something
that players don't think about often
enough he mentioned that like well think
about your opponent's range and your
opponent's Tendencies and um and then he
can look for that because all of the
studying that he did he mentioned note
locking he mentioned flopzilla any men
toy games these are all have nothing to
do with uh spending hours in the solver
trying to figure out what that they have
to do right what's the strategy no he's
trying to understand the mechanics of
the game and then once he understands
the mechanics kind of the cost effect
relationship of a strategy he can then
look at player tendencies in game and
think about okay well where does my key
come from versus this opponent or how do
I generate highs if he versus his
opponent given the information that my
opponent has given me so those were kind
of the main takeaways that I got from a
technical side obviously we can uh keep
on going because I think he just dropped
bomb after bomb after of the bomb of
good knowledge so I want to thank Mato
again for sharing so much wisdom and
being so open with us I want to uh thank
