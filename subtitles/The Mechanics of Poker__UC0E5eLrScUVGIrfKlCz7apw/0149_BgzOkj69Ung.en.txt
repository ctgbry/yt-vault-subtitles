but i think i'm still going to go
and hope for the best
and he had jack knight suit
floated me with complete bananas i mean
it's possible that there's a bunch of
bananas going on in this guy's game i'm
not aware of
i'm talking about soiled bananas too not
not fresh bananas fresh bananas are
another story

alright
jumping in the middle of the action
playing two tables of a 500 nail zoom as
usual
it is a very weird time for me as it's
sunday night
eight o'clock
another day in which i normally play not
the time on which i normally play
but ash when you guys see this
i'll be uh zipping coconuts from the
brazilian beaches
beaches b-e-a-c-h-e-s
and
so i quickly still had to had to make
one youtube video that is then planned
to be released in the future
before i leave which is
not tomorrow but the day after
so here we are
on a sunday night
grinding out some 500 nil zoom
so let's try to make the best of it they
had some technical difficulties starting
up
which can make me a little bit irritated
so let's see if this irritation gets
transferred to the poker tables i hope
not of course
if not we should make a little deep
breath
i am lucky
i am skillful and i will win you gotta
feel it
pocket h check alan one
don't necessarily mind the lead on the
turner
we have good suits to do it with as well
so let's go for it here we face a lead
i don't really have anything going on so
i'm just going to fold this one and i
think on the river we're just going to
check and hope he checks back and like
pocket sixes or sevens
or a queen hi
he had queen 10 hearts
doesn't really seem gto
but hey
[ __ ] ggo
six seven suited can make a lot of
pretty things so let's see
at least you have a six
could raise this
but especially versus one third but i
don't know if versus health pot i want
to do a lot of raising
probably would
might want to do some raising
let's start off with a call
first one third i would have definitely
raced
and each fault monitor
hey jack going to start over the seabed
cut over his big blind face a big check
race so i'm going to default
i'm gonna raise her with the h4 versus
i don't know
iso here versus pablo very bad flop
very bad flop
do i want to keep
the initiative though with a pat
i would say usually yes
even though our hand is pretty [ __ ] on
many fronts
and i think on this turn i'm just going
to check fold
even though i am just tempted to
blast it off but it doesn't really have
much it's kind of the problem
in terms of money-wise
i expect him to now raise some strong
hands here on the turn so that when he
calls i think his range is quite weak
the king is actually quite interesting
i'm gonna do something funky
okay
so that was
i mean not necessarily ice cream but for
example i was like king king jack king
queen
ace jack ace queen those were actually
hands that i was planning on barreling
off against and then when i actually hit
the king
and i mean also like maybe a low pocket
player or something but mainly on these
boards i would say
high cards and like some lower pairs
uh especially if a broadway hits or
something but then when we actually hit
a king we can suddenly try
to induce
a little bluff
like a little tickle bet
try the tick whim
tickle him by the balls
so he does something funky
uh
nine ten off two and a half is
close go for the fault it's 500 l zoom
a little bit higher stakes with lower
rank i would have called
um but yeah i think uh in general it's
fine play here we flop
the absolute nizzles
on aboard that
i mean a douche should be pretty
unrelevant i think actually i'm gonna
slowplay this one
i think basically the whole board
this one
gonna open sometimes not this time
and we face what we wanted to face
also because we're playing versus the
guy white already know
so let's just uh have him do something
random
the nine should not have
hit him that often okay he did snapchat
back we probably had a nine
somehow
yeah the queen nine suited
easy call here to the 3-bet
without the back door's not going to
race
i would like to have some more equity to
do that
and turn i think we're just forced to
fold
trying to think what is better ace queen
or king queen
actually maybe it's a bit closer
actually than i think
maybe it's actually still quite close
not really sure actually
we're in the third phase in the three
quarters
we first actually wanted to take a look
at the barrel range
it's x the silver is actually not
barreling king 10 queen then suited here
on the turn all that often
i do think actually that happens a
little bit more in game which would make
it good for our hand but we can actually
see that king queen is usually just
folding and it's the
mainly just in jackex that we're
continuing it's actually a spot where we
even so because i thought for example
that pocket eights would have been worse
than king queen
um
so that's why i thought king queen
might have been a better
call but i do think
that this definitely gets barreled more
often same with king queen that maybe
had like a screener is king a bit
barreled a bit less
so i would say
it's obviously still close but in
hindsight i think i would have preferred
a call
here on the turn
i'll look at that hand afterwards
let's check right here with the ace king
actually got to do something funky
incredibly strong and aggressive play
i'm gonna call here
very bad flop
i think i'm just pure fooling this even
if he goes ten percent or something okay
he checks
because basically anything is better
except for h jack but the asia off i'm
not rebuilding always so
i'm gonna check back
turns the ace it's good
go with es5
he checks that's also good
i think there's not much else to do than
check
you could make an argument to bet
for like some to maybe fall out like
some split equity
but i think just checking down is
probably just the best play
it feels maybe a little bit nitty to not
squeeze out the bed somewhere
actually i'm gonna bet the river
even though i do open myself up to
getting check race and that's not great
but i do feel like
i do feel a lot like checking back
so if i'm already wanted to check back
hands as strong as ace queen
then why would he
slow play
that's kind of my
my argument unless he has exactly ace
ten
you know blocking all of my uh i love my
calls this guy's been going away now
twice in a row she dooney
luckily he didn't do it this time
because this is a good scenario
just uh
as your fault
i'm going to start with a
i don't have a diamond i don't have a
club so i'm actually just going to check
but
arguments could be made for a bet as
well i think
king jack i guess it would just be a bad
king 10 only with a club and king 9 i
would just always check
and i don't think this handles much else
than just check
folding
he's going to have quite some king heis
as well we sometimes win
but the main problem is yeah if we if we
have king high and we were trying to
bluff him we block a lot of dancing he's
going to fault
but he had 7
10 off suits so he had nothing and he
just decided not to bluff
fives
i'm not gonna bet this board very often
five so let's say 50 i rolled high so i
started with a bet
then seven here i think i'm going to go
for it uh 10-4 i think i'm going to go
for a check race
some of the time
it's not it's it's not great
obviously i would much rather have
some like some something like 96 or
something something that can turn some
goddess to go with his hand
but i still think
i'm not 100 sure about this one it seems
like a very shitty let's say two lower
cards like
nine let's add nine four
i would already like that a little bit
more so he has a bit more bad folds with
the ten
but uh
i
cannot have at all and on the river i'm
gonna try to
get the showdown
but
expect to win never
six seven
gonna start checking with the diamonds
i only have
suited so then
usually if i have the diamonds one i
will play it the most passively
bucket eights
now we're on the turn i think we can go
a couple of ways
actually i don't mind starting with an
over bet here with this one
blindfolds blind actually these low
cards
are quite good blockers because
top pairs that he can check back are
maybe like a6 a7
and
we block that now
so i actually think that's quite a good
spot and we're going to check quite some
strong ads as well so i think on the
term we're going to over better block
here with pocket eights i'm gonna
continue betting
actually we should have just better
bigger i don't know why but it's small
and the river i think we should over bet
i think the term we should have already
sized up a bit the right size down
he jams
which basically now is saying that he is
not flush which is quite interesting
given the line that he took or at least
he has a flashy saying
since i bet it's mimbat and i bet at one
third
it's a bit weird to know just only just
show up with a flush
but on the other side what other hand
does he have
kings
with a heart
queens with a heart
i'm actually i'm gonna fault but
not sure
look at his hand afterwards
go with the pocket dance i think he can
still very bad at nine
so
or pocket dance himself
or have a bluff
i know quite some conflicting points out
there with the pocket h
i'm gonna overlap because this guy is
really short
king jackpot is just very good for me so
i'm just gonna start off with a bet
and go to check the turn hitting nine
don't think there's anything else we can
do
queen nine i decided to check and let
him do the betting
see if he does something random
interesting spot to check race for
safety he calls okay now i'm just gonna
go out of the way
and probably gonna go for a
check
raise
with the 9 8 i think that's actually a
fine play
we don't have a queen which is good
because i think that's a hand that he
could have blocked the river with
yeah i think it's a good spot we bucked
the ace 9
we back the ace 8
with buck check 9.
check 9 is actually not very relevant
uh there's a car in this moment we get
dunked out okay let's call one here with
a screen let's start off with a bad ski
[Music]
and probably checking the turn
taste then
probably checking
not sure actually what to do here could
could make an argument for betting this
hand
and a screen checking again
probably calling the river unless he
bombs it very big
here you know face it oh he goes pot
that's it is big but not very big
so let's first call this guy here
near jack nine
and this guy is saying
what's this guy saying
you really value betting like pocket
fights with space for this sizing
oh
okay yeah apparently he did okay shout
out to him
i i would have i would have actually
thought that hand would have better the
smaller sizing but i guess i was
wrong i guess he read the situation
correctly
very good board for me here if i trivet
from the small blind i'm gonna start off
with a very small bed
phaser race easy call
and definitely calling the turn as well
i really like having the 9 because it
doesn't it doesn't block any of his
potential bluffing candidates
and with the ace we block a lot of value
so i'm quite happy with my hand
river actually
so i would prefer to bet a lower equity
than king 10 or a higher
how is it possible higher
this also may be something that doesn't
block somebody
[Music]
quite a big
him
quite interesting as well
the sizing here is a bit different 2.5
to 13. so we do miss four big plans in
the pot
he bets half pot which actually it's
still a fifty percent checkpoint for him
i was actually quite surprised by that
given the big blind three bedding range
often a little bit in the middle
uh i think the way people usually
construct battery bed ranges this is
quite a decent board i would say
three best half pot
and then actually i saw that we have
some gems
but we are deeper so i don't really
think that it's going to apply for me
now so then i think just not raising
only if it calls is fine
uh turn is a deuce of hearts and we can
see that it actually likes jamming
instead of check jamming but i think
given the spr i think if you make the
sbr a little bit deeper and gemma
becomes less attractive or out of
position those hands then become check
jams
he checks and here indeed we can see on
the turn that kingdom of diamond
specifically
okay wants to never bat and king 10 of
spades for example wants to bat this is
kind of the concept that i was talking
about either want to have more equity or
less equity more equity than i said in
the diamonds let me see
okay there i was wrong
what is uh what else is marked in
general we're actually not really
batting a flush draw that's kind of the
conclusion right
okay queen 10 of diamonds is that more
equity in this case so an overcard to
the jack an open ender
uh yeah i guess i would have made a
small mistake there by betting 108
but it's queen 10 all right
then ghost check check
on the river
versus the
the three quarters so
close to it in this case he has 87
we're actually always
mainly folding king 10 of diamonds but
in general king 10 is gonna be in
different
um
what
but here in this sim big blind has a lot
of
weird
range of bluffs
that i'm not really sure if everyone
shows up with for example is he gonna
patch up bluff ace eight off suit
no not really sure if he has that in his
street betting range
uh but then again he also says let's
check nine off suit
or
so yeah not not 100 sure i did indeed
think this hands would often check again
but that's something that's good to see
so i think the river call or fault is a
bit whatever
because this is also a very important
card for me and then ace eight i'm just
gonna check down versus other a size
so
[Music]
is
[Music]
is very good for us
though
not very happy with this
is
[Music]
is
i think i'm just gonna jam
and i think we're just trying to stack a
lower flush
and i think it's also a spot where
on the turn we could definitely for
example play like h5 that way
with the ace of hearts
also i think
the
oh
i would say
whatever you want
is
and i think it is
very weird spot to jump but
general
check
again i think okay
yeah
because normally i would just use one
size
later
and then i think we just checked
don't mind
not a lot of big betting here but
actually i don't mind it with this hand
and let's try let's let's forward him
again [ __ ] it
let's see how he responds to that okay
he folds again
to zero for the wacko actually that's
not completely too high this guy is
already 100 parts of me as well but in
the previous war so far
so we do it again we open it three bets
before bed
three times
in a row
now the third time this is this is
called schoology guys going 10 years
back in time now
the third time they have it
not gonna play too much big bets on this
board so this is actually
that's the end i'm going to barrel
sizing i think
pot is actually okay
during these king eye boards
uh you can borrow with some ace
and obviously uh depending uh
the suits
so when the heart comes up barrel your a
sighs that have a heart with them
just because then you block a little bit
more fault
uh calls
especially if you have the ace of hearts
you can make some big butt loss in the
future when hearts come in
okay tree bedding
and forbidding some of a little temper
ski on this board
let's see what slap sound makes of that
very good term for him
i
don't think i'll have a batting range
ace king what does ace king want to do
ace king probably
i'm not sure
i'm not sure actually what actually
wants to do here
probably just call
it's a very bad river we're now also
losing verse 5'4
but i think i'm still going to go
and hope for the best
and he had jack knight suit
floated me with complete bananas i mean
it's possible that there's a bunch of
bananas going on in this guy's game i'm
not aware of
i'm talking about soiled bananas too not
not fresh bananas fresh bananas are
another story do you want to make 2022
your greatest poker year ever
now i've done a webinar on how to do
that in our academy which we have made
available completely for free so go over
to poker pokerambition.com
and let me help you achieve your goals
no chicken stuff for this guy guys no
chicken son for this guy
that's quite a wild flow though i have
to say
are you supposed to float that no you're
not supposed to load that
nothing preflop you should be in there
all the time as well
so
that's it's a bit funky it's a bit funky
it's a bit funky
it's not a little donkey versus snap
style stef cell's not biting though
no of course not
this is this is quite out of that okay
we face 200 puff from kills avatar
we have a call with our king
and
i would say on the river
we don't ever have a better kicker than
this
in terms of like
the k9 i might i'm most likely betting
the flop with king queen i'm also
betting the flop with so we have no top
players at box rates so then what is
better game five for queen jack
we'll take five
[Music]
[Applause]
because he can bluff with a hand with a
9 in it
that's why
slap styles
let's draw some runner on the diamonds
dealer
all right that's one
i'll tip you in advance
okay stop starts goes for the healthbot
66 that's an interesting
sizing scheme
i mean we have an easy goal
it's a very good river
i don't think yeah as much or you
specifically snap checks back now with
an eight okay yes close to the second
i don't think we're gonna leave down the
river
yeah
seems or weak i mean it seems weak
that i meant in this case
i would need to have a heart
i think that in general is uh
if i randomize if you can call it like
that definitely leading the turn
it's a very good river
particularly
i feel like
[Music]
checking
he checked checks okay
i'll just draw a small bat
and go from there
the king jack i will check again
not really sure on the on the eight i
will mark the 89 as well
in terms of river sizing
i definitely want to have some blocks
again
okay given the fact that all these cards
now
start to connect as well i'm going to
bed
but i thought that
given the fact that we were unblocking
all
pairs i thought the over battle was okay
however he's most likely calling an
overpass with a hand that has eight in a
nine
so that was kind of the
the conflict that i had
it could be that you
prefer over betting with
a five
so you get a lot of calls from jk jack
nine maybe eight
so
that's why we mark hands
to review them later to see if we can
learn from them
so nicely on the river
eight nine here on the river we can
actually see that the solver does a
bunch of stuff
um if he has a heart
that means he's probably blocking some
of imposition's bluffs
let's see i have hearts
nine six of hearts
we niner hearts okay so it's actually
blocking some of the bluffs and
therefore it just wants to fire out big
because basically then if you have the
nine of hearts and you check to watch
your opponent he's going to bet less
often right
uh some other suits
then suddenly it flips
so it's very it's very suit heavy that
he likes to take particular actions now
obviously there are certain concepts
behind that
however
in game to really kneel specifically
suits in this spot it's going to be
quite complicated
especially for example if you could if
there will be a clear pattern here that
the eight of hearts and the nine of
hearts would want to be big it's quite
obvious but now the eight of hearts only
wants a bad small
um
then jack
was indeed one of those hands where i
thought okay definitely checking
that makes a lot of sense because
he's very unlikely to have a tenant jack
to call you with pocket fives i think
also i mentioned that that's a hand that
i just will always want a bad big
because it can get calls
from
that's very big probably get calls by
eighteen nines okay ninth even races
okay interesting
uh same with pocket eights and obviously
very call heavy with jack nine and
jacket and that's kind of the thing that
i that i remember thinking about in game
that that kind of sucks with eight nine
um that's why actually also we see that
the over bet isn't that common there
aren't a lot of fans about the overbet
king five queen five i think are the
best examples right by four
because then you get called a lot by
eight nine
um
eight nine
also doesn't mind that ten percent
and then kind of induce a bluff race and
let him go thin or we check but
basically 10 percenter check looks
pretty similar in positions now just
going to tell you about a jack and then
from there we can check race and this is
a very big advantage of
checking obviously with the hentai 89
that if he then bets we can have razer
win
for example he now bats jack 9
we jam
and then jack 9
probably has a call for stack so
i don't think i played this end
optimally
these were things that did cross my mind
but i don't think i really think it i
don't think i really thought it through
sufficiently
do actually like to check with eight
nine i prefer to check
i think that is a that is actually a
fine play but as you can see it's it's
not it's not a horrible mistake it can
basically do
a little bit of whatever i think it's a
bigger mistake if we
went for a check with king five which is
something that i would not have done
kind of sometimes open the base five
i'm going to start off with a bad versus
recreational
normally you do a lot of checking out a
position but that's because the
impositions range connects usually quite
well right but hey where players are
recreational
yes
it's like we're playing smaller versus
big blind okay this is how you should
look at it we're playing small versus
big only we have a
enough
draws
on the board to call
and obviously we're dead versus a king
that's also not good i might try to call
on a deuce or something but i think then
we would also have a gutter
but you get the point
straight with the race
first hand
mikal
let me check
do i check
actually very good for me
i don't mind implementing a little lead
here
why not
he calls
we got a little one-third value down the
turn
i think we will have some leads we will
play some leads there on the turn
also mark that hand
to look at not going to review
everything on stream but you know for
all curiosities
yet night and offsuit
we actually pretty dominated mate
we actually pretty dominated
ace and off also if it's quite dominated
we like to be on the dominating side of
being the dominated
if that makes sense
eject then
flop actually you can do basically a
little bit of
whatever uh he then raises
he actually raised the 9 10 in game it's
a low frequency race
turn is then the nine it's up to us and
we can actually see a two percent dog
frequency that's not a lot and then jack
then gets dunked some of the time so i
probably
would have overdone it but i fought
specifically specifically with jack then
i really liked it
i really liked it all
and then river is the king and then i
think jack then should just upright
actually still sneaking out the little
ten percent bat i like this bed a lot
too this is really really kind of sexy
if you're gonna bet something then that
that that is then probably your sizing
okay
i think it's an italian living in
hungary
could
i be know it is
i'll play a bit more polarize on this
board
big bad check
would be my approach
here on the turn
gonna go for
check
he starts with a
bet
we have an easy goal
river is the seventh
that makes me want to check this
he should probably better nine himself
i'll go for the check race
and he did refer to queen seven i
thought the seven was unlikely
we get a check back
with the ac5
so let's say i had jack then there or
something i would have definitely bet
the river but i think j7 we can go for a
check race so then i like
checking
we checked again with the h5 he gave up
here pocket3s i'm actually gonna throw a
little call
everyone is very deep so then i think
flopping a set adds more value the last
tip i have for you is on small pocket
pairs
and these are hands that you can win
monster pods so when you get delta
pocket pair try to flop a set
play it smooth and win all the money at
this point it's very good for us so we
start to dunk
six it's awesome let's say actually also
uh
actually let's continue play some deep
state poker why not normally i think if
i would be on a quote quote no more
grind
this guy's been using quite regis sizing
so far
if i would be on my quote code no more
grind i would just uh
reset to 100bp now
obviously you know i think
nobody is really an expert here
at
very deep play in online poker in
general
maybe if you play a lot of zoom it might
actually be worth it because you can get
deep quite often
but
yeah
i would then just play 100 beware
very confident that i
didn't know very well what to do
obviously it's not like you want to be
deep i don't know what to do i have some
general principles
but like for example not building big
pots out of position with offshoot hands
that's just you know
a simple piece of advice that you guys
can now
put in your pocket
i'm gonna mix here on the turn and
actually if i have a pair
to go
with my then
i'll do a mind betting big
bigger
let's say so
if i had a long ten
then no but i have a diamond and a pair
i don't know
seems a bit better basically if i have a
pair
the board is less likely to bear
i think just the embedding big there i'm
folding out
some not equity of
some eight high so like ace jack or
something i think it's beneficial
but you could also then make the
argument then okay yeah if he doesn't
call you then what's going on what's
going to call you so then you can
surpass
oh obviously you know it's nice if you
can fault if you get some some equity
there but
yeah
if that there comes the cost of uh
you're not being called anymore then
that's obviously a problem so
maybe that was a sub optimal
you're going to do mister behind the
hell there
who have no clue
what's this but i don't think it's a
regular that's half past easy call six
spade dealer for
youtube don't make it a thumbnail
straight flushes all around it's good
clickbait
now unfortunately that didn't happen the
ace is bad card because he could have
been bluffing with ace jack or ace queen
and now he could give up obviously case
of king jack king queen something like
that
attorney could maybe have better the
set maybe a bet some worse flush
okay checks
hmm
i'm gonna squeeze that's a small bit
i hope he has a worse flash or a set or
something
doesn't anything funky
there oh there he's gonna do something
funky
oh that's not great for hell there
why do you do that
why do you do that so dumb
yeah
i think i'm just gonna fold
yeah i'm gonna fold
it is a
very good voice for me
or at least very bad board for maxi
that's why i fall to ten percent
but i get it five dollar
no way that was five big blinds
so that is
25 25 is a lot of height
you can buy a lot of nice things for
that
and heyo is the local currency
as max is from brazil
with 25
okay for personal experience you already
come quite far
i'm really not sure about that seventh
hand
conflict i felt a little conflict
that's what you get for reopening the
action in position
don't try this at home guys
and i like the queen eight as
the check race check race
so that's what i will do
so i retrieve it to seven eight
but they didn't bite
i'm gonna still check on the river
okay then he probably had a medium
holding
it was likely to fall anyway
hey pocket nice okay nice was gonna fold
the turn not sure about the river though
this queen eight we check raise the flop
and then the turn what do we do we
indeed see that we want to check raise
this basically always
he calls turn is a three
up to awesome we can see actually that
queen 8 wants to bet actually quite
often
but checking is
you know
if you look at the blocker score also in
gto it's nine which is not good in this
case right we're blocking a lot of the
calls that's not good
this is the best blocker score i guess
you can uh you can get
five seven with definitely barrels five
eight i would have also barrelled but i
thought between eight
specifically
i liked as a check
if by check
imposition
should that actually is draws most of
the time
okay so he's betting that quite often
this
it kind of depends the more he bets so
let's say it goes check check and the
river queen eight again it is checking
some of the time
and if it bats it bats
still bets actually for an over bed
now
that's for a medium sizing i was going
to say over bet it's quite hefty right
medium sizing
we check
he should block his remaining draws so
maybe i
i gave him too much draws still on the
river actually it's still value betting
between 10. i don't think actually that
happens in practice all that much so
actually we lose value there i would say
definitely the floated king jack or
blood ace tank would definitely be the
case
i think it's close
the more passive he is with
this type of answer on the turn the more
i think a check becomes good and vice
versa
but i think
on a board as dry
as the queen h5
give him
room
with jack 9 9 10
9 9 10
10 jack
which he has in his range all off suit
and then you can also have 6 7
call
the seventh eighth i'm gonna call some
of the time not this time
so yeah i do like the way i play my hand
and king jack i'm going to check back
and that he could check race check for
displaying
queen so exactly with king jack i think
we don't really mind him realizing and
obviously
we gave him a little bit of room to
maybe block the river with a hand like
h5 or something
he double checks
um
i think we should squeeze out a little
bit now
no
i i i learned from my mistakes
okay
i learned from my mistakes
reopening the action with pocket sevens
not gonna
that way
if it was
if the flop was jack satin
check 94 if the [ __ ] was jack seven four
and then turn nine i'm way more likely
to bet the river because then he can
so that's
another reason why
i didn't bet and like i said i think ace
jack for example is definitely a hand
that he could play this way
this is a tree bed
from this struggle
safari has been playing really tight i'm
gonna go for a call
and let him do something funky
i think
another youtube video has gone by
without me saying this
literally
he's thinking about it it's good i'm not
gonna check yet
you could make an argument though nice
and jacks
how often is he going to do something
random how often is he going to do
something random
i'm just going to check this right away
is you can keep just a random hand in
how much do we have left
definitely go for a
bet i think half ball is good
i don't think there's much else to do
than jam
but i'm obviously a little bit concerned
especially now that the temporals of
jax
oh actually this den is pretty bad
but we should get enough random hero
calls i think from ace king or random
ace five of spades to still jam but the
vs king's race is not surprised though
his pocket jack's okay
that's good
that's good give it to me baby
what the [ __ ]
me we're gonna go broke there the
question is how right that's usually
what you want
what you want to figure out
you're going broke now figure out how
best to go broke
a [ __ ] player with pocket deuces
i like pocket 26 because it unblocks all
bloss
and we still have some equity with the
deuce of spades
and
and we sometimes win
because this guy's a recreational
do we win this time he's jack
no he just had a straight flush
don't put in any money against a
straight flush boy
yes i'm sorry
very sorry
uh
sanctity
don't think he's uh
so far
he doesn't really look like the seabed
type so then
i don't think we should bet that
but yeah the good thing also there with
queens is
um
maybe it would have been checked with
with jax for example or pocket dance
obviously not on a 10 river but you get
my point so what queens also does by
check raising is preventing him from
making a nitty check pack
so yeah the more crazy you think the guy
is the more you should go the less crazy
you think the guy is the more you should
decorate
great advice
thank you
um really tempted to do something
but this is literally the worst hand you
can have
threes because these three guys here at
the end seemed i don't know what they
are
in this kind of
pads half spot so
usually they treat a little bit less and
if they start if they attribute you a
little bit less then you get to see the
flop more from the pocket threes which
is obviously amazing
uh ace jack suited i think we can still
through that even though we're very deep
like i said it's a hand that can make
the nuts so that's usually quite good
and just gonna start off with a
one-third seabed i believe
am i
yes i am
i opened the ace now for the same reason
this guy here is in the big blind
who seems i don't know he is but
even the half pot dunk there
or he knows something that i don't know
just you know very plausible
or he's just uh messing around
which is also very possible got a three
bet here with the king queen off but
sometimes also true about this but in
this case uh
he seems like a
not really a recreational but also not
really a pro
actually this might be a little bit
loose in 500.000
you can start for the call
it's a very bad term
go for it
king queen suit
do we go a barrel i think actually we do
call a barrel with seven eight
not necessarily thrilled about it but
i think we do
let's kind of depend on on his strategy
though
king queen
that's again
weird weird hands but then again this
guy is also a bit weird
i think the 80 is not great
i'm not really sure
but
why not game jack okay good hand
king queen i decided to go for the term
beth which i'm also not really sure
about this one
definitely calling a ski i would have
definitely checked but i thought king
queen maybe is an okay spot for
for a bed
let's review that 7 8
i will also review this hand
he's thinking about it for ages what are
you thinking about
this is really weird with the timing
what are you timing about for ages
if you can still jam a skin
are you playing as king this way
what do you have
i'm going to make a new default
and review that hand
interesting river
i think we're gonna win
he had complete bananas
i'm talking about soiled bananas too not
not fresh bananas fresh bananas are
another story
retweet better pre-flop see what at one
third let's start here
indeed almost a range but for a small
sizing kind of what i expected here is a
jack
and we can indeed see we do quite a lot
of checking and quite a lot of small
betting that's uh what i had in my head
i would have probably actually in game
checked ace king more often to be honest
and bad king queen a bit more often
probably
i kind of over underestimated how much
ace king he has in his range
um
the benefit of checking is that he can
start bluffing with some of these lower
pairs
so those are very low equity holdings
that could be turned into a bluff
the downside is we lose some value
versus hands that would now call our bat
mainly pocket dance 910 suited
uh some acen suited
so we do go for the bet in position now
like we were deeper but that's gonna
change
things a little bit because our odds are
gonna be better he did go for around a
3x race which i guess is this sizing
he should now raise me with jax ninth
makes a lot of sense right yes it
unblocks all our value in the top end
you should sometimes raise queen jack
that's a bit
uh this mainly with the clubs
ace
king [ __ ] it then some of the time
we
already starts folding king queen yeah
very slightly some of the time but i
think if we would just run through
i actually will not fall so call is
indeed to correct play
river is the seven
we check
and now in position
shoot damn nine stance okay that makes
no sense okay so he should actually jam
ace king so that's very bad for us
and given the timing right i thought
that that was something that he was
thinking about if he should still jam
asus or ace king
his queen
is one of his bluffs as well
main bluff so that's actually not very
good probably for king queen king queen
obviously checking back he's actually
still sometimes jamming king queen which
is a bit funky probably
a bit of a murder play
does blaster mainly come from ant like
ace 10.
and ace nine
and still pocket sevens with a club
it's a bit funky pocket sixes with a
club
where they're raising the turn
but
actually yeah they were some of the time
okay so that's not really uh a hand that
i would say everyone would find
so they go in and then with king queen
we see king queen of spades folding
because okay because then we don't block
king jack suited
and with king queen of diamonds we do
call
but it makes nothing
so i would say
that our pilots in game are pot so 32
percent this is uh not pot or from it
it's almost like uh this under half pot
i would say in game
it's fair that we fold it
but then also at straight away here at
the ending we had the seven eight
uh pre it was indeed what i already said
it's quite loose
in this sim it's calling some of the
time
the flop actually i did actually
the check race did enter my mind
slightly
um and we can indeed see that that's
actually what it does want to do some of
the time in my head actually i would
like to have check rates more and like
six five which
i guess it also does because with the
eight
uh for example i don't think we would do
seven nine for example right seven
no yeah these type of hands never okay
so that that fault i did have and it's
even already falling down seven uh that
makes a lot of
sense um then on the turn we face the
king
he he has a license to barrel basically
so
if he has license to barrel it means
that
it's hard to over barrel right if you
can already barrel
over 70 of your range
in gto it's very hard to over barrel
however we do still see some
non-intuitive checks like the 8 is very
bad because it blocks the
a10 off the 89 off the
the ninth no
the jack ate off
so these hands they're actually not
always barreling so
it could be overbearing but then again
a lot of ace highs are going in the mix
like ace eight h9 i don't think
people will find this barreling
frequency so
i would say that we should probably not
be continuing here we actually continue
with a race
it's quite interesting blocking i guess
kings have suited i do have to say this
is really dependent on the range
construction because we went he went big
on the flop but
this solver only did this 13 of the time
we don't know what his range is
so if he overdoes the two-thirds c-bet
that's definitely going to
change
how aggressive he can be in the turn
but yeah i think the bottom call is a6
the a7 i think those hands indeed make
better calls than the river was i think
the six
we check
and actually play this hand very gto
i was a bit confused
and then a7 is indeed our call yeah you
don't wanna have the the eight or the
nine in your hand
you know queen eight still sometimes
calls yeah this was just a punt from my
side i think
