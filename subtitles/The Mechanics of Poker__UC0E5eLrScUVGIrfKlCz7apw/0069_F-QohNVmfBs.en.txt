hello
and welcome to the weko show i am
keeping an
eye out on my email because i wanted to
start playing
and pokerstars told me that the 25th
my account would be unblocked i was away
for a week but apparently
they sent me an email back and i still
had to reply that i agreed with the
terms of service
but now i resent them an email that you
know me
wants to start streaming you guys want
to see me playing
so i'm gonna keep on refreshing
and see if we can start playing and if
not
we just continue the high stakes reel
which we left off last time
in a game with these
crushers linus dex and mr helmuts
highlights being uh the bluff i remember
of linus
on table two this was the highlight of
that drill i remember the big bluff has
someone commenting youtube
when i do that on 50nl i'm being called
a spewtart and when linus does it at
he's suddenly a genius this is
indeed how it usually goes right
but i don't think i think we discussed
this i don't think this is necessarily a
genius move we also
have a special guest coming up in the
next high sex room
uh try to already get it done this is
real but you know
when you deal with other players you
know
things might take a little bit more time
but i'm pretty sure we'll have a nice
guest for the next high stakes reel so
i'm really looking forward to that
but yeah so far no email of pokerstar so
we're just gonna have to do it
um with the high sex drill again
like what i like about these heisig
drills is then we can focus a little bit
more on
a little bit more on informative you
know i have more time to answer
questions i have more time to explain
what's kind of going on at this
at the table i would say in most streams
that we did
in this format the footage itself was
kind of just
something to keep us entertained
uh and i think the main value was just
in the fact that you guys
can interact with me directly and we can
talk about certain topics
so let's just uh start i think where we
left off i don't remember this for web
part it was
raised three bad four bad call
and now it's up to linus and lions is
going to start with
a quarter seabed that's going to be most
common i would say
somewhere around that region 20 30
percent
definitely not the board where you're
going to go smaller and also i don't
think a board where you're going to go
bigger
maybe there's a small frequency bigger
bats
pocket queens first one coming in my
mind
king this is gonna be uh a very
high barreling frequency for the
imposition and via very
high folding frequency for that position
so i expect lines to almost
double barrel range here for again a
small sizing
and i yeah helmut is a little bit
handcuffed
due to the ranges and due to this turn
and there's not much else
he can do than overfold this is
a common misconception that people
have this um
minimum defense frequency in their head
yeah but if he now bets and he can just
bad range
well due to the ranges he is allowed to
bed range
and basically you're
you you just have so many weekends if
you're gonna try to defend
mdf formula uh you're basically just
handing his range money
okay i think in general playing poker
from
mdf perspective i'm not a big fan of uh
at all
because also in poker especially
in non-heads-up so basically the
heads-up maybe there's a couple things
that are different because in heads-up
you have to win money
from your direct opponent whereas as
soon as it becomes 300 400 506 and that
there's
you don't necessarily have to make the
most money
from your direct opponent right so it's
a little bit of a different philosophy
yeah 25 percent yes on the turn i expect
the 25
pop barrel for around range yeah
so here we have it that's basically
this is kind of yeah helmut's hummus is
a little bit handcuffed so usually
if you also want to come up with bad
sizings and also to
improve your own game in terms of bad
sizing if someone uses a sizing that
puts you in a tough spot reflect like
hey is this a good sizing
against my range am i being put in a
tough spot
because usually you put someone in a
tough spot
yeah he has a decision so i
i usually when good players put me in
tough spots i really try to analyze that
situation okay how did
i get into that situation how does this
situation work why can't he put so much
pressure on me even with a small sizing
in this case for example
and then i will try to add it to my game
as well this is kind of the benefit of
playing against better players right
they keep on putting you in tough spots
sometimes you know it's also just
negative variants so analyze the
situation
if this is something that you can uh
that you can learn from
as i wrote you on instagram q a okay
so now i'm gonna but i have to say i'm
liking
ah okay you're the one with the three
questions in your opinion should i do
gto stuff post flop
and even preflop in some cases against
these players
in my brief experience i don't see them
bluffing much should i play
more with my gut
yes so gto okay should only be used to
build solid fundamentals
and solid philosophies to towards
that you use towards approaching the
game right
but in my opinion and even in gto's
opinion
if someone doesn't block the river you
should not be block catching guys it's
quite simple
uh this is just a general good poker in
good poker is
you try to figure out what your opponent
does and if he has a better hand than
you
more often compared to the products that
you're getting right
you shouldn't go so in the end yeah you
have to try to figure out what he has
and this is something that gto players
forget
they're very consumed about how to play
their own range that they even forget to
think about what the [ __ ] does my
opponent actually have
okay and this is then you're down you
went you you had
you had a sort of crossing my range or
his range and he went into the my range
crossing and then it went all the way
down the rabbit hole where they should
have
tried to figure out what your opponent
has okay this is
a very big mindset difference between
players who grew up in silverland
and players like me started playing
before silverland
there was a switch in philosophy
and yeah you're good okay your gut is
basically
unconscious information that is not yet
uh trained enough for you to access
consciously
right so what you're when your gut tries
to tell you something you should always
reflect what's what's my gut trying to
tell me
and your gut is just based on a lot of
information so let's say for example
you've received the
bet and you've called down ten times and
every time you were wrong
the eleventh time you're good is like
hey real name
oh hold on a second hold on a second i
think we you know this calling
bets we've lost quite a lot of money
so your gut has a point there right but
now the problem is poker
in poker you can call correctly
rationally 10 times but your gut
doesn't see it that way your gut just
like hey dude what the [ __ ] are you
doing
your gut and your brain in general you
you are not made to play poker
okay they don't your your gut doesn't
understand yeah but i had to be right 25
percent of the time your gut is still
gonna try to keep you safe and it's like
hey listen man you're burning away money
stop doing that
okay so yes your god is a place but you
should always be very aware
of biases that can enter in your
gut decision-making process right
but yeah you have to start to understand
what is your god telling you
and then and this is why for example
self-awareness is very important as a
poker player
you have to understand what your god is
telling you and then kind of filter out
okay
is this just a bias or is this truly my
gut
giving me good information that i should
maybe look into if this spot is indeed
on the bluff they're over bluffer do you
need some help playing three bet pots
out of position well for that we have
created our master classes
in which we dedicate one coaching
program to dive very deep into a
specific spot
go over to the site pokermission.com
masterclasses
and eliminate those weaknesses there are
ways to
analyze for example i'm very big fan
of because in the end especially also
ourselves with students if you can keep
staying consistent in everything that
you do
you will be fine if you're doing decent
things right
usually what throws people off from
their consistency is their influence of
results so good run bad run
so i think it's very important to always
analyze your data
to see if you rank good or run bad
and then for example yeah you can also
see oh you're crossing at high six
people usually
as they say in holland go walking next
to their shoes
which means that they get a little bit
too cocky because
their confidence goes up with their
results
okay so if they're then in an upswing
they think they're the best and then
they're gonna make minus ev decisions in
terms of game selection for example
whereas if you saw like hey i ran quite
good
okay the result of this little upswing
is that i ran good you can kind of
calibrate your
your confidence like okay yeah we played
well and this is very nice
but you know we're on a little bit of a
good run so let's
let's just keep playing and see where
this is gonna go the problem is
you don't want you don't want to do that
you want to believe
that you are now the [ __ ] king of
poker that's why you don't want to check
your results if you're doing well
if you're doing bad everyone wants to
get the confirmation that they're in a
downswing right
but if they're doing well they don't
want the confirmation that they're in an
upswing
they don't take any credit for the
upswing and they they blame all the
credit if they're in the downswing
or at least no i said that wrong they
don't blame varians for an upswing but
they blame varians for a downswing
coughs red baron disagrees
remember what do you think about
listen with variance is also like for
example
let's say i play a three-handed game
okay and i have
quite a good idea how someone plays and
i have certain adjustments that i might
make
against that player and i see those
adjustments immediately working in game
okay so i am actively trying to exploit
my opponent and i can clearly see that
it's working
that then variance
in my list already drops right they have
a couple exploits they're doing well and
i can see it's working i can see him
making the mistakes that i know he's
going to make
then i already i don't need a huge
sample anymore because i see
that it's working what do you think
about
shot taking
i think the lower you play
and it also depends on your expensive
the compound effect of
being able to grind higher is always you
to
take aggressive shots
how do you see if you run good or not
other than poker tracker yeah
that's what i meant you have a tracking
program and they have to run
certain filters that indicate variants
so yes you have oh any v but oh nav
doesn't really say much
so come up i'm gonna let the reel come
up what could you
come up with right now that you could
filter on a monthly basis to
have a better better estimate of the
impact of variance on your game
so here actually we have a bad flop
three quarters
turn and then we're gonna see a riverbed
i would say
all in okay
sexy taxi dixie he's going for it
i made a video about triple barrelling
there are some concepts returning
and i'm gonna check who paid attention
why
what is the main driver behind the o in
sizing in this spot
so it was raise call
button versus big blind check call one
turret if i'm not mistaken
check all three quarters and now check
jam
chicken video is the best ten nine ten
nine is the driver behind having an owen
he doesn't have any straights other than
like one combo
because you're supposed to call and lose
most of the time
yeah no so block catching and in general
your
your bluffing frequencies and bluff
catching frequencies again they don't
really remain consistent because
if i mean i'm aware of it and if i bluff
catch someone
or bluff catcher spot 10 times in a row
the 11th time there is
a voice in me that's like yeah i'm just
tired of calling and losing
and then you might make a fault that you
normally wouldn't make and this is the
human factor
of playing poker right it's very hard to
remain consistent
and we will go like this so if we're
here and the goal is to go here
we will go like this i'm trying to look
at my camera if this makes sense yeah it
makes a lot of
not in a straight line that's impossible
but if you go like this
and someone else goes like this you have
an edge right
yeah so he's quite capped and indeed the
910 is a hand that i would say
always plays this way if you are dax
and never plays this way if your line is
so we have another advantage and
therefore we can
start jamming and now basically hence
that
that line is is probably going to call
you with is a hand like ace nine
because let's say for example dex does
have aces dex can just still jam aces
okay because aces is also the nuts
because lioness doesn't have a straight
all right then if you're bluffing here
if you're dex you should probably still
want to have a 9 or a 10 even though
linus doesn't have a 9 or a 10
this is everything to do with blocking
the calling range because line is like i
said most likely calling race is ace 9
because ace 9 blocks aces
and blocks 9 10.
then you can go from the other side
again yeah well if you're a lioness then
should you go with a knife
and this is so someone asked in the
instagram what's more important blockers
to value blockers to bluffs
uh this is why in gto especially on
river you will see a lot of frequency
calls because often they kind of go both
ways because if dex is bluffing with
a 9x or a 10x but its value is also 910
then if you have a 9 or 10 you're
blocking value but you're also blocking
bluffs
and then it comes back to someone what
someone said all the way in the
beginning
the main goal is to figure out if
someone is over bluffing or on the
bluffing that's way more important than
having a 9 or 10
but the 9r10 definitely does help i
would say
align his vaults which is going to do
most of the time but yeah uh
why oh and why not just 4k also this
comes
a bit more into practical poker if you
think your opponent is going to overfall
to the o in and you have a straight then
by all means bad 4k
what happened here
no way yes yes ladies and gentlemen
we have a little donkey donkey donkey
linus is like
watching the stream guys linus is
watching the stream
linus is watching the stream calls
queen i board i love it man donkey
donkey donkey
do you think linus is now thinking i saw
the record stream
playing yesterday he dunked this board i
like it i'll try a little donkey as well
pretty sure that's his reasoning oh god
i love it guys you [ __ ] dunk
you do it again i remember in a video
before i've told you to not
dunk why do you do that why do you do
that
so dumb let's see what develops
elmwood's elm is not giving fox helm is
just racing
we actually get a call now from linus so
lionel says define his hand as
investment worthy and we see a nice
little pot here from
helmuts which i think he has a fine
plate so he
he raced the donkey donkey
lions is going to show what is set here
call
interesting four eight nine
now the four shouldn't change anything
lions never never has a four
helmut says the straights possum
possibly has this trait i think it's
very unlikely that he actually would
raise something like that maybe he
raises
king four of hearts or something and
then that's the turn that's an option
yeah this was this was this was just
very likely a queen versus an overpair
he didn't bet the river
a little bit of a nitty-gritty
[Music]
almost goes for a check race
he has the threes and four's advantage
ellen seven dudes just for you just
subscribed thank you very much
probably because it's a sexy shirt so
this is how we do it guys
we sell ourselves to gain subscribers no
problem with that
very ethical definitely within my values
linus is very short on timing but he did
manage to find a little through bet
putting some extra pressure
what woody three red with
gonna be quite awkward with this stack
size if you're a little bit shorter you
could maybe
four bats stacked like some ace kings
but now it's a bit tricky maybe like end
like king queen or something blocking
like some king jack
queen jack
value is always easy to find that guys
queens kings
aces or these aces without the heart
call okay interesting ace turn
should not really hit linus all that
often i would say i don't mind
helmets throwing out a little ledy lead
here let's see how much creative player
here he goes for a check interesting
linus what are you going to do if your
line is small bet i guess
oh yeah he's going to he's just going to
continue small bidding i like this play
i think it's fine
funky hand like these are the spots
right yeah
no nobody has watched the gt03 in in
this situation
so this is just you know you have to try
to figure out what your opponent is up
to
let's see what helmet thinks
i mean 1k i don't think so there's a
quite an easy reason why 1k is usually
not used
in this position i think
because basically if you bet that small
in general in position
except for like some four web pods which
maybe you could say range construction
is similar
but the the problem with 1k is that it
has to then outperform a check
and with 1k you open the betting action
so i don't think that
actually happens
we actually get a fault from mr helms
interesting
maybe he had like sixes with a heart
or like queen jack or something
he probably didn't have a draw
one third there for lioness very high
frequency
this turn i expect some checks yeah a
little bit deeper
maybe a block it's definitely also an
option here's your pot this is this was
the option that i
would least take so
quite interesting why would you pot
another big fan of pot
trying to figure out which hands i could
do this with
h3 with this sbr now on the river
probably going to be checking yeah that
makes sense
yeah i'm not another pot fan on the turn
i don't really know
what the pot is all about
any faults i don't really like the pot
on the turn
i don't really know what the this is all
about
perhaps he wants to just ship it and go
to bed and they're like they like to see
they like to see mr house it's time to
ship it in and go to bed
no no that was definitely another ship
it didn't go to bad spot a little check
right here from lions on the pair board
linus loves to do this the small check
raises on the paraports
that's a call let's see if he follows
that up with a
little betty
this turn is a bit dicey i would say too
bad small would go for a
check big personally if it was an eight
i wouldn't mind betting small okay okay
let's go for a small bed pushing it
and now we just bet small again then in
that case alliance can do something
completely different
we we have a good we have a solid we
have okay reader helmet so far but on
linus
it's hard to have a good read i guess it
makes on the river
so yeah if i just say it's a mix on the
river then anything can happen
i'm never wrong it's ought to be in the
bahamas with them wise
confirm no
wait what happened so he did go for the
check
did he check my queen queen deuce did i
say that correctly
all right queen deuce oh my god
