if you are playing your plock and pairs
only to flop a set you're missing out on
a lot of EV in this video I will show
you guys the modern approach to playing
these low Pairs and show you the five
main reasons why these pairs are way
more powerful than you think even if you

[00:15]
more powerful than you think even if you
do not flop a set let's go the first
power of the pocket pair is the EV of
its improvability Beyond flopping a set
when I started playing poker the most
popular advice around playing these
pocket pairs was no set no bet meaning

[00:32]
pocket pairs was no set no bet meaning
that you should try to get in pots
cheaply with your low pairs try to flop
a set and if you don't put no further
money into the pot I even remember my
coach back in the time telling me that
if you see players barreling pocket pars

[00:45]
if you see players barreling pocket pars
you should call your friends the reason
he said this was because pocket pars if
they don't flop a set they have very
little Equity to improve especially back
then all our betting and calling was
done around equity and while it's true
that the pocket pairs have less outs and

[01:01]
that the pocket pairs have less outs and
does Equity than let's say a straight
draw or a flush draw we missed something
very important the outs of these pocket
pairs are way more disguised and
therefore have greater implied odds
meaning that if you do hit your set on a
later Street your opponent won't see it

[01:17]
later Street your opponent won't see it
coming and therefore is way more likely
to put money in the pot as it perceives
these turn and rivers to be blanks Power
number two increased fold Equity due to
its unblocking properties next to the EV
of having it another reason we pick the

[01:31]
of having it another reason we pick the
Bluffs to seabat or Barrel it's due to
its blocking and unblocking properties
preferably blocking the hands that call
your bet and unblocking the hands that
fall to your B so we enjoy the maximum
amount of fault Equity possible take the

[01:45]
amount of fault Equity possible take the
following example we are button versus
big blind and after having seat the Flop
we can now seat to turn let's look at
our straight draws and our pocket pairs
while with having a straight draw we
have four or even eight out to the nuts

[02:00]
have four or even eight out to the nuts
and some additional outs forsus second
and third pair we still prefer to check
that hand often and instead use these
low pocket pairs as Bluffs now the
reason for that we find in venous
folding range on the turn because the
straight draws block a lot of the hands

[02:15]
straight draws block a lot of the hands
which villain is going to check F the
turn rate which reduces our fault Equity
but if we look at these low pocket pairs
they don't interfere with the folding
range AKA they have good unblockers to
Barrel which makes them enjoy more more

[02:30]
Barrel which makes them enjoy more more
fault Equity than the straight draws if
we continue on this example and we look
at the EV of barreling our draw versus
our pocket pairs you might see something
very confusing barreling the draws has
higher e than barreling the pocket pairs

[02:45]
higher e than barreling the pocket pairs
then why do we prefer beding pocket
Pairs and checking straight
[Music]
draws now the reason for this is not
necessarily a power of the pocket pair
but more a theoretical principle around
how to construct ranges that many

[03:01]
how to construct ranges that many
players get wrong we don't just bet or
barar our hands that have the highest EV
to reach the desired frequency but
instead we must compare the EV of
betting our hand versus checking our
hand and then choose the highest EV
option now whilst barreling the draw has

[03:15]
option now whilst barreling the draw has
in the more potential ake checking the
draw and always realizing our Equity
sometimes hitting a pair on a later
street that we can value bet or get to
Showdown also has a lot of EV where
these low pocket pairs often have way
less Showdown value and improve ability

[03:32]
less Showdown value and improve ability
to be played passively and therefore
betting more easily outperforms the EV
of
checking the third power of the pocket
pair is you are actually value betting
next to generating EV by getting more

[03:45]
next to generating EV by getting more
and better hands to fold we actually
also generate EV versus some parts of
villains calling range as especially on
boards that contain a lot of king and a
high draws players will often continue
calling these draws as they expect to be
up against wor draws than them as these

[04:01]
up against wor draws than them as these
are the more traditional type of hands
players would choose to barrel with this
play Works especially well versus
recreational players who tend to overall
a lot of their draws and have way more
random third and fourth pairs in their
flop calling range which we can fold out

[04:15]
flop calling range which we can fold out
on the
turn power number four they back the
team so far we've discussed how the pcka
pair itself generates it TV but it
actually serves a greater non-selfish
purpose in your overall strategy a

[04:31]
purpose in your overall strategy a
common problem with the way humans
usually construct ranges is that they're
too focused around Equity the problem
with this is that when all the draws
Miss on the river you will have way too
many Bluffs in your range on the flip
side if all the draws complete you will

[04:46]
side if all the draws complete you will
now no longer have any Bluffs which
discourages your opponent from paying
you off now not getting called in these
kind of scenarios because you don't have
enough Bluffs really hurts the EV of
your value hands and while the attention
in poker often goes to the cool Bluffs

[05:02]
in poker often goes to the cool Bluffs
and big hero calls getting maximum
amount of value out of your value hands
is actually where most of your money is
made a solver looks very far ahead and
adjusts its ranges even as early as pre
flop to make sure it has enough Bluffs

[05:16]
flop to make sure it has enough Bluffs
on all possible boards and Runners that
exist to make sure that its value hands
can cash in for the maximum take the
following example we call pocket Deuces
to a three bat and the Flop comes king
queen Jack our opponent bets one quarter

[05:32]
queen Jack our opponent bets one quarter
of the pot and while most players would
have mucked as soon as villain reaches
for chips the solver actually has
different plans and calls the seabat now
the interesting point is the EV of the
call the solver is actually not

[05:46]
call the solver is actually not
generating much to any EV with calling
these low pairs however when we remove
the calling of low pocket pairs to the
cat and now compare the EV of our M
hands we can see that these now generate
significant less EV as when we always

[06:01]
significant less EV as when we always
fold our Deuces on the Flop and the turn
is a 10 or Ace for example it's
impossible for us to generate EV as we
have no Bluffs to encourage our opponent
from putting money in the pot now while
in theory this Bluff does not make you

[06:15]
in theory this Bluff does not make you
any money getting to these completing
runouts with your low pocket pairs in
practice will as it's likely that your
opponent will not be able to put you on
enough Bluffs and therefore will start
over
folding so to conclude the fourth power
of the pocket pair increasing the EV of

[06:32]
of the pocket pair increasing the EV of
your mid Hands by having Bluffs on all
possible runouts and taking one for the
team now for the fifth and last power of
the pocket pair I want you guys to play
the following hand with me we defend
from the big blind and check call a

[06:45]
from the big blind and check call a
seabat on the turn we Face a barrel and
decide to call again the river is the
biggest brick in the deck and facing a
bat we are pretty happy calling down as
we have a strong hand and the board ran
out in a way that it's impossible our

[07:01]
out in a way that it's impossible our
opponent has improved to a better hand
than ours right we call and villain
shows up with pocket Deuces rivering a
set the [ __ ] so for the fifth
and last power of the pocket pair it's

[07:15]
and last power of the pocket pair it's
that pleasure you get and that pain you
uce when hitting your set on the river
