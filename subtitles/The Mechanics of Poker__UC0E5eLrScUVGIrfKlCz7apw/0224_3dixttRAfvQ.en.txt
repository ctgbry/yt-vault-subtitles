I'm going to say something a bit
controvert but I think people need to be
massively R oriented today on the PO we
will chat with the only
23-year-old high stakes cash game player
and fellow GTO wizard coach yolan Coan
yolan is a world record holder in image
memorization first time I competed
obviously I trained a lot before I broke
the world record I broke it again in
December 202 won he then transitioned
into poker and after 2 years of messing
around he was playing already at high
stakes and so at the first session I'm
done like 80k or something so I'm like
oh jeez it's not going to be good second
day I bluffed way too much and I done
like probably 80 or 90k so I was done in
two session like1 100, 70k Booker is
like a language and if you only study
you have a lot of informations but you
don't know what information to choose at
the real time to perform better and so
let's say I want to learn Chinese if I
only only train vocabulary I'm not going
to speak Chinese at all as you mentioned
sometimes we make the same mistake a
thousand times and don't learn and
that's the most frustrating so how do
you make sure in the part context that
when you are make mistakes it does
become something that you learn from no
you cannot you you will do mistakes that
you will do 10 20 times before fixing
it's not binary like I do mistakes I fix
this and sometimes mistakes takes a lot
of time to be fixed sometimes it's
really important to wonder is it really
a cooler or not you know like oh I play
uh I forb Kings she has AC pre flop uh
cooler yeah but I mean you are big blind
against early position so the key is
really to understand like what do you
remember what you don't remember and if
what you don't remember like it doesn't
cost you any EV you just you just switch
to something else so if you do something
100% that supposed to do done zero% you
should probably pay attention but you
know if you did something 75% that
should have been on 25% you know who
cares put your energy elsewhere you
remember in the past when you know GG
had 1K and then you had VIP games at 5K
you remember that
by before we dive into today's episode
quick announcement we have seats open to
our mechanics of Poker coaching program
if you want to work with me and Adam and
make more progress in your poker career
now is the time use the link in the
description down below or go over to
mechanics of poker.com for more
information but without further Ado
let's get chatting with yolan yolan you
have um quite an interesting background
story which you mentioned helped speed
up the learning curve in poker viiew you
competed in memory competitions and even
have a world record in concrete images
memorization could you maybe share some
insights into the world of memory
competition and how you uh rolled into
it yeah sure so I started back in uh
2021 um I started a bit randomly um I
wanted
to find games online but um uh games
that will be uh useful for me um and I
discovered memory through this at the
same times I wanted to like improve the
way I was um learning things so that was
like the perfect area to dive in um I
trained online for po six or eight
months and I started to do live
competition in October
2021 and there was one thing I was
particularly good at was memorizing
images there's two categories there is
uh concrete images with like it's uh
images of something that is real and
nonconcrete is called abstract images
it's images of um uh how can you say
this in English uh like absolutely um
can I say this in English it's basically
like um gray area uh that are like f
fied uh in the in the it's very tough to
explain actually but whatever uh I was
good at conru Mages so I started
competing in it and the first time I
competed obviously I trained a lot
before I broke the world record I broke
it again in December
2021 and uh after I did three other
competition so the competition is alive
uh it's in Europe and it's under the E
League which is the official like memory
competition League uh for live events in
the world and it was quite quite a lot
of fun um obviously started to um like I
would say I already I was always in
poker but like do more like uh be more
serious with the game again so I stopped
um the competitions I didn't see any any
things that really bring me why I wanted
uh especially given the fact that I
already had in COD could you maybe share
some more insights you know how how does
a memory competition actually
work yeah sure so it's like it's cool we
we all have one single table uh in front
of us we have one computer and so Sly to
send us Links of the competition so it's
like an online test that's get the same
thing um the only thing that you have is
you have uh headphones for the sound
that like can cut the sound
uh and also for some um some um some
um uh some different discipline so for
disciplines you have a which call like
um a reduce of vision so you just put
like a a mask like this to focus
directly on what you have um on the
screen anyway and so we have through one
or two days we have um in between like
eight and 10 um disciplines um there's
world uh name in faces numbers calls and
images so every time I was asking if it
was in France I could ask to change a
schedule so like the images are at the
morning because the problem is if the
images are at the end it's actually very
difficult to be the recall and the the
poorest calls as did was in Italy 2022
and imag was like really the last
discipline of the day and the problem is
your super TI because all the other ones
and the thing I was doing is like let's
say I'm doing a aatan for example uh in
sports I will wait um the last uh
discipline if it's the best discipline
for me so I mean not even competing
those one so I'm not cheating in a sense
but like if I'm here for the record I
don't care about competing Zone because
I'm just going to be like medium so
what's the point going to do aage score
like it doesn't I mean I don't I don't
like it um and so yeah I did be the
record as say uh 2022 did again in
December 2022 21 um and yes October 21
and the next year I tried to uh beat it
again twice but again was a little bit
difficult because uh every time it was
at the very end of the day and even if
you do nothing you know you just spend
like nine hours on on a desk so uh yeah
but this is how like um basically it it
happens and after you collect points or
depending on um on the score you did
each disciplines and after there a rain
and if you're first you you win
something but it's very difficult to
leave from this I think only it's only
like one and two people as not directly
leaving from this but more like for the
communications that do around the
skills how does uh how does your image
variant differ from the other variants
do you need like a different skill or do
you need a different training process
different technique interesting question
um the only um the imag is the very
difference with the other one is for the
other one I need a mtal pal so I need to
imagine a place put elements into it and
uh try to remember them for example for
numbers what we do is we don't remember
numbers directly we associate each
number between zero and 999 to a
specific MH and so if I see for example
uh 001 I will imagine that something
that is linked to 001 uh and so we need
to build association between um every uh
like three digits numbers and after
create like a story and remember it is
the same for cards uh is the same for WS
but for images you you can do this but I
arrived with a new techniques that
people were not using where I was not
doing this and I will I was doing this
directly on the screen it's a little bit
um different because you don't um lose
time the time to see the digits imagine
it into uh the um the m B is actually
this time of process takes like few
milliseconds but few milliseconds every
time is actually a lot of time so I like
cut it out and did it on the screen uh
plus doing Association on images so it
allowed me to be way faster and to
explain a little bit more in detail what
do I have to remember so there's like
images of block of 25 in uh with five
row um and they all like 600 700 800
whatever to remember and so you need to
remember the five at each row in the
perfect order and if you do mistakes
it's Min six point so you can't like
answer randomly try to have points like
in G school um and so I do Association
directly between images in each row and
the goal is to remember them you have
five minutes to remember the biggest
amount of images possible and after you
have uh 15 minutes to recall and when I
did my recalls in Crazy the time at 20
minute because I didn't have enough time
to recall the informations so the
the the rule change and now it's even
higher it's 25 minutes to recover the
informations and after you you go back
and you have the world images you saw
and you need to um put them in order
yeah do you have like a natural talent
for that or is it something that's
trainable and if it's something that's
trainable you know how does that
training process look like yeah that's
trainable I definitely have an ability I
think it's impossible to beat the world
recall without like having one um for
example like train the one I trained was
actually not my record it was walls but
the walls um were recall is actually
super high for me but for example for
matches when I broke broke the world
record twice the second time it was one
of it was the act the is record between
with
the with the difference between the
second score and the first score all
categories but there are some categories
where it was impossible for me to even
like be close to that
um I would I would say
so um you need you need a talent for
sure if you want to break World recall
but if you want to improve your memory
and have this um in a useful state for
your world life then you don't need uh
like inner talent and the way you train
this is uh by training the associations
you do between mes so let's say see um
what can I have okay let's say I have
like uh back back get how do you say
this in English when you eat sticks chop
sticks oh sticks yeah good so let's say
I have sticks and I have uh what the
[ __ ] is this whatever uh something like
this uh so what what we're going to do
uh I don't know which chance people will
see that we uh what you want to do is
actually to uh put this like say I have
an image of the stick an image of
uh instant cup whatever uh what I want
to do is find an association between
these two do so I can remember so the
natural Association is easy is just the
stick going into this okay this is easy
but you need to have a very precise
association between Imes to remember
them why because um after like let's say
I um see this images at the beginning
and I need to recall it after in 15
minutes how can you remember that is
this and not this see so you need to
have something precise and so what we do
like the best techniques is actually to
do an association with um something that
is close to the extremity of the object
having an action on the second object uh
and but you really need to be careful
with this type of Association because
one one is very easy so let's say sticks
and this is quite easy to do um you need
to when you when you see the images
again you actually need to uh know that
it's not this one so what we do is when
we memorize
even if it's super simple you actually
take a little bit more time to remember
that it's not the opposite and if it's
the opposite again you need to take a
little bit more time simply because if I
don't take it too much time to remember
that when I will see this my brain will
naturally think that the association is
this uh and so you do this for every
images sometime you have like abstract
images for example you have like a
number a later or it can be even only a
CO sometimes uh but the the idea is the
same it's just you do association
between two um two images and because of
five images in the row you only need to
do two per row simply because uh if you
remember one two three four the five
will be the five you don't need to
remember it was uh yep and the recall I
did was 500 uh
547 uh and night as it was beat uh two
times so I'm I'm third but not first in
that's it's quite a lot of images this
definitely sport have being taken
seriously you even got coaching uh by
let me see Andrea muzi I think you
called who is also a world memory
Champion what was uh what were some of
the valuable lessons that he taught you
in his coaching and how how did it help
you maybe also you know I'm also curious
the transition to Poker as well yeah
yeah yeah completely um so it's funny
because we did trading for like both of
us obviously he's the best at every
disciplin except me the main disciplin
so like I was like teaching him a little
bit uh my techniques and he teached me
the techniques he used for the O
disciplines and so what we do is just
that we so the variable lessons for me
outside the memory world is that you
can't memorize when like your F not well
organized it's the the most important
thing and I see too many players for
example in poker like they do like G
Wizard and after they do and reviews but
like the all the things you are doing
you're not even not noting them so your
BR is not going to remember them and so
taking notes is very very important and
even if you don't remember the notes
studies show that it's better to take
notes just to write things down uh
basically um so being well organized
taking notes and also trying to find
elements you can associate with what you
learning which is a bit more difficult
in poker I'm going to lie like if you
see a simulation on wizo like it's a bit
tough to you have techniques obviously
but for like near fit in the memory
world it's a bit more complicated um but
just organized and also not doing too
much is very important memory that's why
like it's like sports training actually
like one week before the competition we
don't train because also wise it's too
much element into our brain um and just
just don't do too much um I think it's
the the main thing I would say when you
say don't do too much you mean that you
shouldn't study for eight hours in a row
or yeah exactly basically the the pass
to study for like super short period of
time uh and now 15 20 minutes is better
obviously studied show that like 40
minutes might be better 35 minutes might
be better but it was studies like kind
of before the social um social network
area so I will tend to advise to people
to do a little bit less because in
average the attention of someone
decreased in the past years um y so
minutes BS 20 minuts tell me is that the
Pomodoro they call that is that that
technique I think like stud break isn't
that something similar I think Pomodoro
is 40 minutes or something yeah but
something simil right you do short
period yeah something s okay yeah
exactly so so you mentioned that organ
organizing your thought is very
important you mentioned takeing notes
any tips on uh to effectively take notes
you know for our listeners now in the
podcast everyone is getting their
notepads out all this wisdom dropped you
know they're like oh I should take notes
now while they to this podcast so so
effective notes start is to be organized
so you can take them up or like do it uh
like
manually but the notes of something that
you do need to be with the notes uh of
the same thing you are doing so let's
say I sty like freet BS if I take a
notes on my computer another note on my
phone a note when I write it's not
organized because all the notes are not
in the same place if the not are in the
same place and are organized in both
different faults and different
categories it will be way easier for me
to visualize everything I want to learn
the best is to do my map it's not it's
not ideal like so better like way to
learn but I would say it's captures 90%
of the EV so I would recommend people to
I mean we talk about
version in detail anyway but to do um
Minds maps online uh so you can take
notes and organize better the way they
learning um and also when you want to to
like um do reminder uh of the
informations your your you want to to
remember uh it's going to be way um more
effective this way uh because your brain
is directly going to visualize uh
everything and we are we will finish on
we are way better to visualize spaces uh
places simply because uh really back in
the days like um Millions years ago or
something um maybe less we um we need we
needed to know like where is the water
where is the food where is my tribute
and so we have this memory that is way
way way more developed than like the Ws
uh memory the the main faces memory
because names arrive later w right later
uh imag is not that much so that's was
like that's why let's say in 5 minutes
the number of wordss memorized the what
we call I think 150 and image is uh now
is more over 600 oh wow so yeah it's
it's actually way easier for the brain
to memorize images um it's interesting
yeah because like also what you said I
would imagine that oh yeah you know you
have a super brain so you can just study
for multiple hours but what you're kind
of saying is by through your experience
with memory training you learned kind of
the limitations of the brain and how to
work around it any other like
limitations or hacks that you know about
the brain that you apply to studying
poker or even playing poker yeah um I
have something but it's difficultly
teachable is I have a good um a better
tic memory tic memory is the is the
memory of uh like seeing something for
few seconds and remember it uh you can't
improve this it's very very difficult if
you with a lot of training you can uh
but it's not something natural and it
helps me because let's say I work on
spots uh on in G wizard um if I see the
Sim six months one year later I will
remember it 95% of the time so I don't
remember exactly the percentage but if I
look specially from specifically for
information so what my hand is doing in
the spot for example I will remember and
what I can advise to people is to at
least improve the
simplify the process and put only you
can do this in result put only um
frequencies at 25 50 75 so like it's way
easier for your brain to remember like
what your hand needs to do
um so simplify this don't try to
remember exact numbers it's not uh
useful and uh just like take notes like
a all of people thinks that people have
a good memories they memorize everything
without like no takings but that that's
not true it's like saying someone's
doing basketball is just good and not
training uh you just need to separate
what things important to notes what
think are not really important to notes
and definitely like the numbers the
frequencies are not very um not very um
useful I would say actually this is
something that I think I already did
like the way I read solver outputs is if
something is always done 100% 0% you
know it's like okay well this is
probably very high in EV so probably you
know these hands have a clear action but
then when there's a frequency I just see
it as this can go either way and then
basically for me that's more of a sign
of like okay well this can go either way
then I reestimate the situation in game
well which way should do I want to go
you know and then if I really really
don't know then you know or I see
benefits in both lines I don't really
have a preference I'll roll the 50/50
but I'll never go to uh 10% 80% 70% and
also something important is for example
in the memory comp ition every mistakes
is minus 6 point but in poker sometimes
you do mistakes and you don't care
because it doesn't cost you that much e
so the key is really to understand like
what do you remember what you don't
remember and if what you don't remember
like it doesn't cost you any EV you just
you switch to something else the way I
teach people for live beams to learn
ranges is to train the ranges on the
software see like where what mistakes
they doing they'll directly have the EV
loss and if the EV loss because they
like fake to remember two or three
combos is is min is minimum you just
don't remember it because you don't you
don't need to be perfect you just need
to capture the highest amount of EV
that's why it's very important to link
the thing you memorize to the
effectiveness your the effectiveness you
have in the memory process again it like
it takes into consideration sort of the
Lim like the limitations of the brain so
if you do something 100% that supposed
to do done 0% you should probably pay
attention but you know if you did
something 75% that should have been on
25% you know who cares put your energy
elsewhere what you were describing is
also is that that's kind of photographic
memory right you we sometimes hear
around is that kind of what you were
describing with I see the solver and I
have a photographic memory yeah yeah
it's this I think it developed uh when I
was young and it was a part that was
more like um since I'm Bor uh the reason
why is because my parents didn't let me
too much screens when I was young so it
let me with my imaginations and I was
like often in my head uh cuz I was like
a little bit shy when I was young so I
think he developed this type of memory
because you you build more memories and
you remember them uh better and for
example I know since I do memory
competition for the case before but now
I can remember every dream I have at
night for example I need to know them
fast otherwise I will forget in the day
but to really something we can do as
well I can do that's interesting I've
I've heard something about that like
that if you train you can actually just
remember people then draw out their
dreams or something like that I I think
I need to draw out I'm not the best in
this area to be honest just it's fun to
like draw and after think it again but I
think you can really remember them well
if you like know them every day and
really like make defaults as soon as you
wake up uh to T version that that that
that's some freaky comic I mean if I
talk about my dreams you know it's the
most random the most random [ __ ] uh next
to memory competition do you have any
other history in uh being competitive
outside of Poker um yeah I did endb for
12 years um I competed uh the best I did
was uh third division when I was 16 so I
wanted to like be on the path to turn
Pros but I I got some injury at my wrist
so I couldn't do it anymore and also at
the same time discovered poker and I I
that Ando was nice but to be honest not
very the the best practice because it's
difficult you don't win that much H in
order to win a like a lot for the St of
our society you really need to be very
strong and I definitely not at this
level so obviously I could have competed
in the second division first division
but never be in the French G like by far
and I didn't I didn't want to be in this
stage so I kind of left basically and
also the problem is when you're very
young and you're like playing for third
division yeah I was I say I play I
played third division though I was like
training I I was not even playing like I
was either not selected or when you play
you just play zero minutes so I mean
it's very difficult when you're run you
need to be very good in order to to play
the
games any wisdom or any lessons that you
picked up that you brought with you into
poker from either competing in memory or
competing in in handball I I think
disciplines uh like you need to be at
the you need to be at the training at
the exact same times every week that
helped me a
lot um I think also like evolving as a
team unfortunately I kind of lost that
with poker but I now start to realize it
was really important to have people have
the same mindset same goals of you and I
didn't have that when I started it was
actually a mistake and um yeah also be
coach because obviously if you're all
coming at the training there's not the
coach like
you know what do we do I we all try but
not in the best effective way in poker
is kind of the same and obviously like
nobody's perfect but at least having
someone that understand what you're
coming from and where you want to go is
is for me very very important probably
the biggest mistakes I did in my career
is not to take a coach uh before because
I took one but three years after I
started so um I didn't have a coach for
like the process about what what I'm
going to learn what I want to do and
there were too many things that I was
training with was actually not important
and if one guy would have told me that
no this is not really important you
should do this or just the way you play
like you should focus more about
maximizing newv not bling balance
especially when you play very small
sticks uh would have helped me uh way
better so when you started out you
didn't get a Cod straight away maybe we
can get into uh how you started out in
your poke career and kind of what first
attracted you to the game yeah sure so I
that um my hand of
15 15s um I was with um in an event
where there was like some some families
and some friends and I saw my little
cousins uh playing with the off it's not
funny but the credit call of his mother
on winamax and um and he showed me um he
showed me poker uh he was playing cash
game I think 10 or something I don't
really exactly remember and so I
remember I I was playing po when I was
like 13 years old we we are playing with
my friends once a week um between two uh
two hours of of school and we were
betting like two Euros so I was already
playing C and G when I was like very was
I was very young but I didn't like um I
just played a game I was not really
interested um I mean you can be really
interested in 1 playing poker and was
always very Weare but uh and so I I um I
saw him playing poker and uh I I
remember that you you can like play for
leaving uh and yeah I found it very
interesting because it was at a time
where I didn't really know what I want
to do I always ateed school um and so
yeah as soon as I saw that he was doing
this I saw some YouTube videos I watched
from like yr's video you know like in
the days and um and yeah after the
second day I was already training this
uh eight hours a day
directly you're training poker eight
eight hours a day yeah
but obviously was doing it really bad
you know I was gonnaa whoa how does it
look like eight hours a day of Poker
training yeah I was doing completely
that's why I sh it with the coach like I
was I was doing spots and in these spots
I was just uh asking myself okay how
much combos do you have in this spots
who who cares why do why do I train this
uh yeah and um I was like um reviewing
situations I tried to see on forums the
analysis of IX players but the problem
also I did is I was just like one day in
poker like I was not understanding 90%
of what the guy was saying but I still
wanted to like try to learn okay what
will I say in these sports but it was
way too advanced for me but you know
sometimes when you start like you want
to like do more advanced stuff at the
beginning this normal we like complexity
as humans um but yeah and um after I did
directly took take a membership for
French like video platforms and just
like watch it videos that's the main
thing I did when I was training actually
was watching videos after and after
obviously I upgraded to Rons uh back in
the days where it was really really good
um like 2018 I think yeah 2017 2018 and
I started to um to watch them on on Ron
was really difficult the beginning
because my English EV was very low so I
was not understanding half of it but you
know after R train and and the then the
sing H gets better so yeah when did you
uh start to get like your first your
first hands in and that you were like
hey this you know this is actually
starting to look like something yeah so
I didn't play I play like very few in
but less than 1,000 I didn't play for
two years and a half um where during
between my 15 and my 18s I was not
playing a single hand uh and the reason
why is because I really wanted to
improve faster than other people and the
way I can do this uh was I mean the
thing I thought about was I need to take
shortcuts and the best way for me to
take shortcuts is not playing and the
reason why is because in nbol for
example uh if you play without training
you're just going to be bad and I didn't
want to be bad especially because if you
B poer you lose money and I didn't have
any money so I didn't want you to lose
the the small amount of money I had uh
so I started thinking that the best
probably the best way was like not
playing and only accumulating uh
thetical um understanding of the game uh
and um also like how to play each spots
for example and it was actually mistakes
like you need to train obviously and you
need to play because if you don't play
you can't execute what you learned so
when I first played I was thinking that
I'm going to be the best direct willan
Pros but lost at
50nl after two years and a half so I was
like how can it be possible I had some
friends were winning in uh there playing
AB a ABI 10 in mtts average by in 10 and
I was like how can I not win and it was
very difficult at the beginning because
I I got like um 800 on like random
accounts and and so I and I I I switch
them to poker site without my parents
knowing so I got like 800 and IED
playing 50 ml so already a very good
bankr management you know um and um and
yeah and I was losing I was not even
understanding why so it was very
difficult this time um because um you
know when you invest so much time into
something and you have nothing in return
it's very hard for the brain uh and
poker is kind of the only discipline
where you can put a lot of work and
sometimes doesn't it can't work it
doesn't work for like a few period of
times uh and I didn't really understand
like how tough montal poker can be
sometimes
and yeah I was just I was simply not
winning and I started to go back in to
go down in stakes and yeah I was winning
at 10 andl but for all the efforts I did
and all the hours invested it was a lot
obviously at the very beginning was
eights but after it was not8 hours
because I got to school um high school
work and stuff to do but I was um
working up early years in school and
when I was coming back from school I was
only doing for girl literally always and
one funny fact is when I was uh the last
years of my school I didn't go out one
single time really one single time so
even at the end with everybody I was
just training poker because I was like
if let's say four years after I say to
myself like I um hang out that I would
not uh succeed actually in poker and
that was like very dumb idea actually
because I mean you can just do both uh
you don't need to do sacrifices but we
we'll talk about it a little bit later
I'm sure so um
so yeah and after the thing that changed
is that I got contacted by um a guy
named Leo french guy and he saw my
comments on rton because I was
commenting videos a lot and he said okay
um let's let's work together you know I
play whenl 1K so yeah I play 1K also but
you know you need to remove two zero you
know uh so um yeah I play 10 and I plan
10 also but 10 is not the blind anyway
and so I I said to him that like I
wasn't like I didn't even have 1,000 to
to play uh and he told me okay your
thing is interesting for your limit
maybe I can stack you and so we we
started to um to discuss uh he did a
test where like he put me he G gave me
some money to play in L 100s in front of
him so I remember I was playing I think
I was never like as stressed to play
session of my life I remember because my
um my hand were sweating so much
sometimes the mouse were like uh very
difficult to control you know uh yeah it
was super funny but actually he he
decided to go for it so where we are in
2020 at the end of the lockdown and so I
started playing in L 100 and what
changed a lot is this guy teach me that
the best the most important is thinking
about the eveve of your exact
and and uh it it really um it's um um an
advice was really important for me
probably the best advice I had is really
to think about the EV of your hand why
because the problem of thinking about
only about what's in the my hand is
doing is you don't construct any neuron
neuronal Links of thinking so you're
just going to say oh I recognize
situation so I'm going to do this but
there's nothing from your brain that
comes from naturual thinking from the
real thinking you're just associating
okay these spots with another spots and
so you're playing like this but if you
don't ask yourself okay what my H really
want to do uh and like how can I exploit
my opponents you're never going to
create this this reflection uh and this
habits of thinking about what's the best
move and if you don't do then if I ask
you okay how to exploit people in the
spots you can't answer because you never
trained it and so he teach me that it
was really theory was always really
important and I'll never say the
opposite but you need to understand like
what can be the best and if you do the
steps to like consistently think about
this and actively thinking on the long
run it makes a huge
difference so it sounded like uh you're
trying to apply your Association
technique from memory on to Poker and
from what I understood you were just
grinding the Sol for two and a half
years trying to memorize everything and
then when you put it it into practice
you were like hey this is not how it
this is not working yeah exactly that
was simply not working cuz like I was
thinking I was actually good but I got a
lot of even inory and I was playing I
was playing what I think was GT against
species [ __ ] I don't even remember why I
was doing this so how would you how
would you recommend you know if you
could now start over how would you how
would you do it if you could now start
over uh okay first thing I take a coach
um first thing like day one uh I take a
coach to like someone that is good in
memorization so I know like what thing I
need to see uh what thing I need to uh
to train
um okay and I will like start to like
train the basics of the game and also um
organize the thing the organized the
working elements uh with things that
matter the most at first uh don't start
training I remember like the first year
I was training forit PS I I was not even
I didn't even know how to play buing
against big blind I'm training forit PS
what the [ __ ] big po big a lot of money
yeah exactly I was saying I big pots so
you to
like it's it's very important to
understand that uh it's
um you need to focus the most on the
efficiency of your study and if
something happens way more than another
thing and it brings more EV just train
this all the time and like just don't
train the other one so I will train the
first thing is I will train the theory
of the spots that happen the most I will
understand every theorical Concepts and
after I
start directly learning about the
exploit B I would say and play right
because that's something that you were
play obviously play to train it like not
not playing was a mistakes actually I
would have improved more by by playing
well yeah you mentioned uh you would
straight away reach out to a coach just
like you know I guess you you did in
memory and what you were used to in
handball right if you do a sport in
general there's always a coach I think a
poker that's like I don't understand
yeah why in poers there is this I think
it's because it's maybe in ego games so
people both think they can like be
better with themsel and yeah sometimes
people are proud oh I never been coaches
yeah and I'm playing 500 now whatever
yeah but if you were coach you will play
probably higher man so like it's not
something to brag much and yeah in every
every aspect like if you play uh chess I
play little be B stay bamon you need a
coach otherwise you're just going to get
stuck uh in poker it's it's kind of the
same you will just improve your visual
faster so how like
yeah how how to find a good coach what
what like what what do you look for in a
coach that you're like hey yeah that
seems like a good coach I think as a
coaches um I mean coaching is humans
interaction I'll choose the humans I
like to interact with it's the first
thing if I don't like the guy in front
of me or he's very very very boring when
he's speaking I probably not choose him
because the retention of the information
tells me are going to be um uh less
great so let's say um two people are
teaching you something one is a complete
stranger one is someone you know like
your father your mother Etc in the
second case you remember things better
because the retention of
information all better um that's the
first thing um
the can you tell me the the exact
question again to be sure no yeah what
what what to look for but I think you
already mentioned that how do you get
the most out of a coach I know you've
you've done coaching you've got coaching
how do you get the most out of a
coaching session what I was doing when I
was watching videos is that I was
talking um I was taking free uh the the
free most important thing of the video I
learned and that will bring me the
highest EV and it's very important to do
this all the time because obviously
sometimes going to do one hour a lot of
them going to be very interesting but
realistically I'm not going to remember
remember any of this in six months and
I'm only going to remember this if I um
study them again study the hour again or
like see the things I saw in the study
hour again uh but if I are really
elements that are really important all
elements that I didn't know then I will
not them and um specifically somewhere I
know that I can have all informations of
things I didn't really know and um I
will now te I will now um remember it
better and also review it so the the the
most important is to take notes things
easier that you don't know uh things
that you know you can improve a lot in
your game or things that uh like can
bring you a lot of EV um so let's say I
have an information that like okay I
need to play this S I was not playing
this s at all I'm doing a lot of
mistakes then I'm going to take this
note if there is like one spot that
happens really a lot uh so the vi of
these spots is going to be high in
average to work on even if the EV
difference between what I'm currently
doing and what I can do is small I will
uh also take this into consideration um
and you always need to adapt with uh
with this element and if something I
didn't know like I will I will not this
also it's interesting again like so I'm
sure people listening and me for for for
myself as well like often I kind of fall
into the Trap that I know too much and
then in the end you try to learn you try
to memorize everything but in the end
you learn nothing whereas if you just
like okay all pretty cool but let's
prioritize this is what I want to
remember this is like the main takeaway
that I will go and apply tomorrow
instead of trying to learn to learn
everything a lot of good stuff Adam
how's uh how's your
memory after this conversation I'm
thinking I need an upgrade to start
training it yeah super interested like
I'm really fascinated by this area
because we're all trying to learn stuff
and remember that information and most
of us don't have the right techniques to
taking the information we're learning
but to actually remember when we need it
so yeah I'm curious to ask a few more
questions on this because I wrote down
kind of the key steps what which I
picked up from you there which were
organizing information in terms of
what's most important some form of
simplifying you mentioned like just
there like three most important points
of a a long topic or an area you mention
Association which is what you're trained
at and then maybe create some sort of
visualization like a mind map of that so
I'm thinking like for the listener and
myself who's trying to learn a lot of
things how do you then practically go
about about condensing that information
but also making it so you can bring it
up later like is there some element of
revisiting that information like the
space repetition do you uh have so some
procedure to uh yeah to solidify these
notes you're taking and to to make them
stick in your
memory so uh can tell like few few most
important elements the first one is um
like you said simplification I didn't
even think about it because it was um I
was doing it naturally but yeah you need
to simplify the things you learn the the
most the most important and I see too
many players they take notes but the
notes are like super long like think
about your brain when he needs to
rememorize things if you have like like
very condensed like a lot of sentence
it's not really good for the brain so
like just just be the most condensed
possible and organize the notes in the
way that like they are with the other
notes and it's very easy to see the
other one if let's say I take manual
notes not the best I it's okay but not
the best okay the the first note I'm
taking is on another page and the other
note is another page on your note so the
notes are not connected if it's not
connected on the paper it's not going to
be connected in on your brain obviously
you can but it's going to take more time
so you want to do a map uh which again
is not the most optimal but still very
very good for the learning process and
you just put the notes in the same map
but as the same subject and you organize
them as as you said you organize them
first after you really divide
information by the the core of the
information so you don't have too many
things to remember um and uh you simplif
five State and after for the space
repetition the best obviously is to do
it like all the time is use apps like
eny but I don't like to say like okay
you need to have to do this have unkey
because I'm not doing it myself because
it's too boring and what you learn
something something very important is it
needs to be there's like um an equation
it's like unable amount um multiplied by
Effectiveness and if I have something
that is very effective but I really
really really don't like to do I'm never
going to do it on the long run so
there's no point and that's why like
obviously a lot of people say oh you
need you need unkey yeah in the perfect
wall I need unkey 10 hours a day but I'm
never going to do it it's it's too
boring like I just don't like it and
let's say for example videos videos are
very great not the best way to learn
obviously but very great simply because
I really enjoy watching videos and
so if I enjoy doing videos uh if I enjoy
watching do uh watching videos I'm going
to remember them better simply because I
enjoy more the process and so I can do
it more in the long run so it's very
important not to focus only about how
effective something I learn is oh the
the tool I'm using but how or do I like
to use it for example um one of the best
will be GT wizard I'm not saying this
because I'm a contr of wizard but I like
being on Wizard like using it um and uh
it is very effective so and you need to
select things that like uh have the
highest ratio between those two you yeah
I think that's very important as well to
remember make learning fun and I sure we
all relate to that when we enjoy what
we're learning it just sticks we spend
more time on it and there's other things
that for some reason there's resistance
to learning it and we kind of make
ourselves do it for willpower and we
really struggle we're like oh this is
just not sticking so trying to find a
way to uh engage with what you're
learning from a curiosity from
enjoyments and maybe not pushing it too
far to the extreme if you're not
enjoying that or you hate doing that
it's probably War sign to Pivot into
something else and see I'm really
curious to dive in a little bit to U why
you feel that studying poker and not
playing isn't effective as you mentioned
for other things it works really well it
works well for memory championships it
works well for sports if you double down
on training performance becomes a
byproduct of the work you do but for
poker it seems like the element of
training and performance they don't
correlate as well if you just study
poker you're not going to become a good
poker player like because you want
perform so why do you feel like in poker
particularly there's a performance gap
between learning knowledge and training
and execu that
knowledge I think it's because poer and
it's it's coming from my um it's coming
from someone I I coached to told me is
um and it's actually very true Booker is
like a language so if you only train
let's say English and you start talking
in English English is too uh vast
language to start speaking it directly
obviously you're going to to be better
than someone not training but it's too
too too big actually and poker is the
same is it's too much area that needs to
be practiced in the game in to actually
perform better and if you only
study the problem is you have a lot of
informations but you don't know what
information to choose at the real time
to perform better and so let's say I
want to learn Chinese if I only only
train vocabulary I'm not going to speak
Chinese at all like because the time it
will take to find the vocabulary and the
O world and the other one is going to be
too much so yeah it sounds I will speak
Chinese but my sentence will be 30
seconds uh too long so it's not really
Chinese and in poker for me it's the
same just that's the the area of the
game is the game is way too big so when
you start to train each sections if you
don't remember instantly the vocabulary
you learn and you're not going to play
directly well uh that's for me the main
main difference main thing yeah yeah as
you mentioned there as well it's like
the linking of ideas together but also
like trying to figure out what actually
is needed and what's not like stripping
away all that extra stuff and trying to
figure out actually what what leads to
Performance yeah as you mentioned that
the languages are really good um example
of that CU I've never learned a new
language but from people who I speak to
have they see like being in their
country that speaks that language and
just conversing is just like 10x the
kind of um learning curve compared to
try to learn it so yeah that's a really
really good example and thing I will I
will have is um studies show that we
learn better with humans than computers
uh and that's why like for example in
school it's better to have a teacher
than having a bot uh from to some extent
obviously um yeah and that's why it's
important to for me have a coach uh and
train with a human especially because it
will uh faster the um faster the process
uh and the one thing we mentioned is uh
we can't only train at poker but it's
it's very true when we say we can't only
train one thing at poker like if you do
only one thing too much like too much
solvers uh too much exploits too much
whatever it's not going to work because
the r is too complex the poker is too
too big and it's the same uh thing with
the vocabulary if you only train
vocabulary for language you're not going
to speak the language you need to
understanding it speak it uh and yeah
poker is kind of the same in this
way you said we learn better from humans
than we do from computers which I think
is very interesting to note as we move
into this AI world of chatbots and
learning more and more from computers so
yeah I would I want to pull on that
thread a little bit but I also want to
come back um to your story and kind of
linking things together so you chatting
to Ren about learning memory and then
also getting into poker did these two
Journeys overlap did you start poker
first or when did you become
the I start po like way earlier than
while I dive into the memory I dive into
memory first time when I had my final
exam at high school because I didn't
really want it to work for that so I
tape on internet like memory techniques
for like learning uh and so I first like
trained it I can like it and after the
exams I I focused mainly on poker but
one year not even not not one year like
six months after I came back because I
was saying to myself oh I want to do
some like something else on poker but
like for really few hours day few hours
a week and I wanted something that was
useful for poker uh and so I started to
like train again online and yeah train
multiple hours a day and it was fun
doing it uh and it needs to be fun
because if I was doing it and I didn't
enjoy it I would have done it three days
so I was selecting the the things I
wanted to train and the things I liked
to drain so images uh names WS my
favorite categories and the the
categories I ate the most so like when
you have to remember like infinite
amount of informations like for example
when you associate each digit with a
with an images you need to do it for
1,000 times and you need to do it very
fast so it takes it takes like 40 50
hours so I did once and I really hated
it uh so um yeah I prefer to do like w m
it's F
see so early in your PO career you
mentioned to R you were approaching it
wrong in terms of training the wrong
things for the wrong areas I think you
mentioned that you were kind of break
even SL losing your first few years of
playing you were making progress I'm
curious to know for you first of all how
did you get through this period but also
what was some of the internal
self-doubts in a narratives that you
experience at this time because I'm sure
haven't come from the world of memory
you've already like solidified I'm a
smart guy I can learn things quickly but
things didn't click quickly for Pock so
how were you navigating that that was
very difficult like I remember I was I
was I was really sad like uh I invested
so much time and uh I didn't have any
succeed so I I started feeling some
period where uh I was not um very
confident in myself
and also because of that mainly because
of that I yeah just just made me S was
really not the best time for for me and
but I just say to myself like I need to
go through the world process otherwise I
will have some regret and uh I had one
coach at UNO was saying if you really
train one% you can't have regret because
you did everything you could to make it
work and so I kind of have this
philosophy where I was saying to myself
okay let's take few months and if it was
not working I will do something else but
I was kind of committed because I really
didn't want to do uh something more
classic because I didn't find anything
that I really liked uh so I was it's not
truck but I was very incentivized to
succeed I would say because I didn't
really want to do the other things I say
um and yeah and um and so Mally I I
think
I just use resilience uh I don't think
there's like effective way to like
really feel better in the situation
because I have pain it's normal uh it's
like if I have if I put my hand into the
heaven I mean it's going to hurt I can
use the all the techniques in the world
yeah maybe with some techniques I can
feel it's less but it still hurts uh and
in poker sometimes for me it's the same
as my perception when I get through my D
strings
um I I was just not feeling good and the
the best way is just to accept it and
and go obviously you can you can trade
change your perception and I I I got
someone coaching that was really useful
uh but but at the end yeah I think just
uh resilience is uh is really one very
important uh thing to to have and I
didn't understand back in the days that
it was normal that Booker took so much
time and I think I got my ego was a bit
too high thinking that like I can be
like the best in two or three years no T
higher and sometimes it can even take
more times to start winning and doesn't
mean we dumb doesn't mean are not going
to be good just that poker is very big
and sometimes doesn't work at the
beginning and yeah but sometimes also
you don't put uh enough work into it um
Can can be this also I will not say I
didn't put enough work obviously you can
always do better but I think if I did
really way more it will not be very
effective yeah
you said something very important where
you need to build your resilience and I
think this is a very key part of it
where when things get tough sometimes it
sucks like sometimes it hurts sometimes
it doesn't feel good in the moment and
if you're struggling it just means this
is a time to build that resilient muscle
sort of thing and I think this is
something we can't learn in theory we
need to go through tough times to build
it and I think what I liked about your
story there is you just accepted that
you all right this does suck this
doesn't feel great but I need to get
through this I think the mindset of of I
need to find a way to go overcome this
this is going to be a good thing for me
building character building that kind of
resolve to not quit I don't know how
exactly I'm going to get out of it I'm
trying to problem solve it every day but
yeah this just sucks for this period but
keep going I think that resilience is a
key attribute and a lot of people who
struggle with down swing struggle with
adversity haven't build that resilience
they just get knocked down and they just
overreact freak out so for you have you
always been quite a resiliant person or
is it something you've developed through
po or before that unest not very much I
would say like the biggest leak I have
in poers for the like montal game I'm
I'm very just not good at it I trained a
lot but just it's just not not my like
main uh main strange but I mean we'll
talk about it later probably um I think
I was committed in succeeding uh in it
like I didn't have any choices so I was
like skinning the games and so I was
like at one% because I I couldn't lose
what what I would do like uh too many
things I was not liking to do so I think
you you can develop uh
resilience because you are very
attracted to do something but aswi way
more motivated not to do something else
than poker I would say I like poker
obviously I love this game and still
love it but I was really motivated not
to do anything else and I think it's
what can really help you develop this
this resilience is when you have this
exal motivation coming in and for
example uh I mean it's classic stuff but
if I say to someone okay you need to do
$100,000 this month you will say me I
can do this and if you say okay we will
kill your whole family if you don't
maybe he will not do it but there's way
more chance she's going to do it because
she has more incentives basically and I
think resiliance is coming with
incentives because I can say oh um in my
competition I was not resiliant enough
to be number one probably I could but I
didn't have any motivations for this
didn't have any incentives didn't have
any things that were really important
for me to do this so I didn't have any
vigilance so for for me both or or
feelings yeah what do you
think agree yeah I think resilience you
need a reason to push through cuz
basically what's happening is the short
term gets a little bit tough and the
mind the body are like is this worth it
and you need that to be able to answer
that question with yes on the other side
of this pan that is something meaningful
for me if you got a strong meaning for
it you're like yeah suck it up ready for
it if you don't have that it's like be
resilient for resilience sake it's like
no thank you go go put your hand into
that hot water and like it burn it's
like I'm good thanks
I'll avoid that so we have a natural
inclination to avoid what's hard and
what feels like could be risky so yeah I
think we need something to pull us the
opposite way to to override that and
just knowing that process of kind of
slaying the dragon overriding the hot
obstacle is that building of that
resilience I like I do think of
resilience as a muscle I think it's
getting stronger the more you put it
under pressure and strain and challenge
if I look at resilient people like David
doggin always comes to mind it's like
you don't get resilient with without
adversity without real tough stuff go
through to make you resilient so for me
I lean into that when I'm going for
tough times going oh awesome resilient
chapter this is my building my resilient
muscle let's get to work feels like [ __ ]
half the time but at least you're you're
realizing it's for a bigger goal that
you're working towards now you mentioned
which I really want to dive into now
that you had like almost like no plan B
and you're going to make it work no
matter what this can all also lead to
the opposite side of the spectrum where
you overdo stuff where you work too hard
I think for you you run into this
obstacle as well where you are playing
poker maybe 16 hours a day a little bit
of burnout so maybe we could talk about
when you overdo things just that that
need to want to be successful I think a
lot of young people have this where
they're so eager to get ahead they're so
eager to achieve their goals like forget
sleep I'm going to work every single
hour every moment in that enthusiasm
comes from a good place but it can be
misapplied so for you how did you
experience that um effort that you're
putting in but maybe overdoing at at
times yeah it's interesting it's like
the 16 hours a day I see it more like a
all Mory thing do you know Mory yeah
yeah so I think I personally I think
this approach is very very bad because
it's good for like a very specific
amount of people and the problem I had
is I saw too many videos where people
saying okay you need to work all time to
time but what happened I do sacrifices I
didn't even sacrifice it I regret
because uh let's say in high school in
high school didn't hang out with friends
one single time and obviously when you
don't have friends and you like try to
learn things um it's tougher because you
don't have this social link that you
should have and so you're not fulfilled
fully and so you don't it's not even
productive and for example I said often
to myself which is was a big mistakes
that like okay we I don't care about
girls I'll will focus about that later
but why later like just live your life
right now and I did too many sacrifices
that was really not needed I think
sacrific is the biggest [ __ ] I heard
for learning things no you can you can
hang out with people you can do whatever
you want it's not because you work out
that you're going to succeed obviously
working out increases your chance but it
doesn't mean you're going to succeed
because you train like two or three
hours a day uh more and even if it
maximize your I prefer to maximize now
my EV happiness and yeah I kind of work
more on the things I'm doing right now
for sure and I would even have more
results but I don't want to do same
mistakes from like I'm like okay I
didn't focus enough on like having
really good relationship and and I saw
that this could really affect um just my
day-to-day work because obiously some
after you start developing regrets
you're like okay but I work too much on
this game I could have done like a
little bit less e force and focus for
example on having a girlfriend for
example or like just having better
relation with your family and stuff and
so um yeah I think what I can advise to
people is just like sacrifices a very
big [ __ ] things I think even hard
work especially coming from like a
memory stuff I know that smart work is
way better than hard work and if you put
every six players and we need to learn
something like I will know uh probably
better how to learn the new thing and so
I'm going to work not maybe not the less
but like average but I'm going to have
better results and I think it's way
better to learn this how to work way
smart smarter and stop with their like
hard work [ __ ] stuff I think it's
very bad especially when you're are
young because it kills your health on
the long run and if you put two people
one is like having a Balanced Life
working less one is working 16 hours a
day yeah the second guy can like have
better results but he can also die at 40
years old so what's the
point yeah there an interesting kind of
split in the culture at the moment where
some people promote like this work ethic
of completely grinding yourself into the
ground sacrificing everything to get
ahead then there's other cultures like
ourselves who like to uh get more
balance and get that kind of Life
optimized as well however often people
like us and we we through a period of
working very intensely and it's almost a
bit of Survivor bias and maybe we work
super intensely to initially get ahead
and then we can ease off so I'm curious
to know from your perspective do you
feel like you need some period of
obsessiveness where you almost like push
things too far before you can kind of
recalibrate and get that balance or do
you feel like as you mentioned it's
better just not to make sacrifices to
begin with and find that kind of Sweet
Spot it's in between like I can't say
like don't do sacrifices when I did and
I that it was useful in a sense but if I
do the same things without sacrifices I
have close to the same usuals because we
said okay I will sacrifice this yeah but
like sometime I was not playing poker I
was watching videos on YouTube so I
could have like train uh relationships
for example you told me um if uh you
need this obsession with the things you
are doing in order to succeed I think
you need to love what you are doing so
you are obsessed with what you are doing
but if you obsessed with something and
you don't like it and you don't like the
fight you're like 100% into this game
it's so going to work when I said I was
doing sacrifices I was not like having
pain saying oh no I need to train my
poker until late no I was actually
loving it uh so I didn't never see him I
never see things as like you need to
push yourself because everything think
is very counterproductive and the way we
learn the way like a human works is he's
going to be more attract to the things
he enjoy doing obviously it's um about
you can't only doing things you enjoyed
or otherwise you just like fat and not
moving and watching movies all the day
so we we need to have this kind of
balance obviously but I think the
obsession is coming through enjoyment
and should not be the um uh the opposite
you think um because if you enjoy
something and you don't want to commit
to to it too much and you force yourself
it's going to kill the enjoyment you
have for the thing you're currently
learning or you want to be good
at yeah which then leads to like an
interest in sweet spot where is it
really a sacrifice like is it a
sacrifice if you enjoy doing the things
you're doing so if you're working hard
but you're loving it and you're having
fun what are you really sacrificing
you're actually moving towards what you
want to do so my kind of feeling about
it is you should never sacrifice Health
never sacrifice relationships and never
sacrifice fun for too long obviously
there periods where you got to work hard
like you said like there's elements of
working hard if you're enjoying that
process of working hard awesome as long
as you're not over sacrificing maybe
health and relationships that's kind of
a good sweet spot but a lot of times we
end up in between where we may may feel
a bit guilty of not working hard enough
and then we sacrifice other things that
matter to work harder because that's
what we should be doing and that's where
it gets a little bit blurry where you
need to to find that balance for
yourself so for you when you came out of
this kind of intense period of these 16
hours what was in the main things you
had to do lifestyle wise habit changes
to kind of find a bit more balance for
yourself uh like what changes for me to
like go from this to a more balanced
thing yes I think I just like uh I
realized that like whatever I do I'm not
going to be more happy like at the
beginning I I really have the I I know's
done but I really have the belief that
like if I got more money I will have
less problems and it's true obviously uh
you can be more free of your time I
don't have to wake up very early for a
job I don't like so I have all these
things or achieved and I'm really um I
have really grateful for that uh but the
thing is um
you need
to I I didn't understand back in the
days that like there will be always new
challenges new problems and new things I
wanted to do and the beginning was like
okay I'm I'm going to like be I6 Pro win
money blah blah blah and when I like
achieved this uh now I was like okay but
at at certain point I was like why I'm
even doing it like yeah I'm going to
play two years maybe like triple my
bfold okay well was what's the point
actually just losing times and so I'm
not saying that like playing poker is a
lot of time but I'm just saying that uh
to myself that um probably I need to
start focusing more on my op CV because
it was M the most on the long run yeah
on the short run at my age I think one
of the most important thing we should
focus on is money in the world uh it's
not the most elf is first for me
relation is second uh but money is per
like very important in all words
unfortunate whatever
um you think it's b or not but and so um
I think it um the switch made one like
the third P was like I I I achiev what I
kind of wanted obviously you we are men
so we always want more and stuff right
uh so near enough was the time to focus
about the second and the first so it was
more natural for me I would say the
transition simply because I I got what I
wanted in term of Freedom like the the
reason why I played poker and my main
motivation was like playing for where
wherever I want whenever I want without
people saying me you need to do this or
this this was my goal so as soon as I
achieved the goal the all extra was more
like for the challenge I would say I was
not that important and it's super funny
because I started my YouTube channel
kind of at this time where like I knew I
I was succeeding and was working well
simply because I think I started to
understand that like I I will pref I
would like to enjoy different things and
I I think the the YouTube the I started
in 2021 was the French Channel and I
started it uh I think thinking that I
need also this balance of like relation
and I didn't have this so I I probably
can create a YouTube for the interaction
um also because I knew that it will be
useful in the future and it's always
great to like uh give back what you had
uh and it's always something I I told to
myself like I watch a lot of videos I
was like okay when what I will get like
better it will be like my turn and it's
like an extra motivation and also it
helps you um for me it helped me U being
in the game for a long time because now
it's going to be next year is going to
be nine years so have to be actually
really a lot especially when you're
young because it's a bigger fraction of
your life uh and yeah if I didn't have
like this um you know other things like
live games or like YouTube or like
coaching would have been way more
difficult for me to stay in the game and
like just play 9 925 because I didn't I
didn't want a 925 and if I only only
play Booker and I start like oning less
that is like a five 9 to5 again more
confortable obviously but still the same
yeah yeah I think it's understanding
like what you like over the long term
you mentioned happiness AV and we all
have a different kind of equation and
formula for that and you were kind of
self-aware enough to realize like long
term you want more connection you want
other avenues other than just grinding
all time and you were proactive to
create that outcome so yeah good good
work on that one I want to jump into
your story when things were struggling
and you turn things around so we've
mentioned this kind of break even patch
where you were studying the wrong things
we've mentioned you taking on a coach
and that kind of really helping you to
for when poker really started to click
and when you started to realize wait a
second I can make a living from this
game and I can actually have a lot of
success from this is it was in um May
2020 uh my first month uh I play one L
200 N L where I was stucked and I think
I did like 8,000 9,000 so divide by two
and I think it's the first time like I
did like a substantial outcome and I I
understood like I could make a living
from this G obviously you have the
exitation and I remember I had so much
energy uh into this like I was I was
waking up at like 5 or 6 a.m. naturally
because I I I just wanted to play you
know maybe it was addiction but I was a
subject uh and so like I just wanted to
play play play play and um and I really
was like passionate at this time even
more because I realized that all the
work I did make sense now so obviously
the two years and a half three years uh
I didn't have any visuals actually
little bit more than three years but I
knew that like it was it was was coming
actually uh and um that that's how I
realized uh I was starting to make a
living out of it uh yeah and what really
changed for me I mentioned a little bit
earlier is when I understood that the
most important is constricting the
neural neuronal link for training things
and if I always consistently deeply
think about what I'm doing and what's
the best action on the long run I'm
going to manipulate ranges and things
way faster than other people and when I
understood this and I started doing this
consistently I was working in my game
all the time because when I was playing
even if the BT was four blinds and it
bet one line I could still think for 30
seconds and I was taking my time and I
think taking your time sounds like so
like a simple advice but for the
technical game I think is the it's the
most important advice uh I I've heard
and I actually done it's the most
important because I see too many players
let's say a player spots and they taking
this decision instantly and the big big
big problem about taking decision
instantly is two two two main problem
the first r on the short run you don't
take the best decision so you don't
maximize the EV you have because in
average you are not going to maximize
your decision if you doing them
instantly because you need to think
about it that's a fresh problem and the
second problem is on the long run we
have less great you have less results so
less visual brings also like um weaker
results and you didn't bu this links and
this way of thinking that can bring you
to higher results because you take your
decision instantly there are not enough
work of thinking exactly what you want
to do and that's caus the problem of not
being um uh not being fast in the
process enough uh to um to um to learn
things simply because now if you come do
it yourself yeah you can watch videos
take a coach Etc but if in games you're
not capable of deeply thinking about
what you're pres in doing you are not
maximizing your UV in this way I think I
I I like to read I'm never gonna say
it's not use use uh useful but the
problem of too many players is there too
much on Theory and they don't think
enough about what's great into the human
worlds because when you play against
human it's way more like a scenario
linked Eevee type of things it's more
like okay what do I lose if he does that
how much do I win how much do I win if
he does this I'm sure I lose if he does
that um and just like calculate DV but
the the way the div needs to be
calculated in theory is completely
different because in theory div is
literally always the same but when you
play against the humans the are not the
is I mean when you play against a human
every humans play differently so there
is the discrepancy in the um in the EVS
let's say I play against a guy he's
never bluffing well maybe is way lower
uh let's say I play a guy that is um
like bluffing a little bit more well my
is like slightly ahead about zero
and the problem in the games of way too
many people is they're going to think oh
in is profitable and it's not about like
oh it's profitable inory but it's not
really against humans but what you need
to really understand is against humans
you need to calculate it the uh outcomes
of the most probable scenarios so let's
say I play situation where people like
over bluffing sometimes and bluffing
sometimes it's near zero the but there
are some players in the population that
never bluffing which are never bling I
lose the world amounts I put in the
middle and so if you don't calculate it
the discrepancies uh the the the T City
zones where like people are in the
spectrum of the V so like let's say you
have like people around zero people that
where you are losing a lot if you don't
calculate the Spectrum spectrum and you
only focus about Theory you're going to
think okay but in in theory my hands is
a call and most people like Bluff enough
for me to have a c yes a bluff enough
but one or two guys not bluffing enough
out of 10 you're just losing M here
actually all the B and the loss is can't
compos the wins and the problem of
theory is it doesn't have this there's
no discrepancy because DV is always the
same and so humans don't have enough
this thinking of um I think in a way of
them of like probability linked to
scenarios and scenarios linked to EVs
and you should think about this all the
time as humans and that's the you you
told me um you ask me how I will teach
myself or teach someone at start of the
PO and I will clearly do this at first
and understand more the way of thinking
like this because it's way more
effective than the oh yeah is there an
optimal thinking period of time because
you mentioned the longer you think the
better from your from your experience
but one players tend to overthink maybe
they they take too long in a spot and
maybe they lean towards biases let's say
they're ger over Cola and maybe they
would normally have F this SP but the
more they think about it they get lost
in their heads it sounds like for you
because you've got such a clear thinking
process the longer you take you just go
deeper and deeper into that process and
the time you spend is kind of used well
I feel like some players might struggle
with spending too long and from your
experience with working players coaching
players have you noticed any sort of
Sweet Spot maybe for River situations
where how long you should be thinking on
these kind of big
decisions so let's say we are in a bluff
catcher
situation the way I'm going to think
this is actually the only way I'm going
to think
is um I'm going to assess probabilities
to scenarios scenarios like what humans
will do with their ranges and I also
assign way toward the
ranges um and okay let's say uh we are
in a spots where he free Barrel he Free
Bet free Barrel okay um I'm going to ask
the first question I'm going to ask is
okay does he always have his value and
play this way and why this the first
question is because if it's the case it
means that my eeve can be the wall pot
because if my V could be the wall pot it
means he will not have his value and he
will only have blocks and when it's not
the case if I do the discrepancy
discrepancies I see that there is no
wirehead of zero uh situations because
everybody has volum in the spots so even
if they Bluff the wall bluffing cobbles
I have I still can't win the wall pot
it's the first question the second spot
is um what people will do in average so
let's say there is a population of 10
players how do I think players will play
if I say that let's say there's 10
players half like 50% of the pool or 60%
of the pool we play uh and okay 60%
let's say 50 60% of the pool uh like
that's SM it's better to not speak in so
let's say the vast majority of people
are in the scenario of like having
values and having Bluffs okay and so I
know that against them my EV is nearly
zero okay because some people over Blu
some people under Bluff sely but it's
basically around zero like let's say a
little bit less little bit more whatever
um but there also some part of people
that they just not going to have Bluffs
because the bluff not see on the Flop
not Barrel or just don't pre barel and
if he thinks I'm like very overing he's
not going to have any Bluffs and so I
know that there are like two the two
main scenarios that will happen and uh
it's not it's not only in term about
like how many people but like what's the
Frequency what's the um yeah what's the
frequency it will happen and how what's
the EV do or E gain because obviously if
one people out of 10 only have Bluffs
it's really important to the equation
because like you win the wall pots and
compens Below you can have
um with other people so let's say I play
against now the population of like
bluffing valuating and like only
bluffing well the problem is um only
valuating the problem is if people only
valuat I'm I going to lose the all
Stacks are putting in the middle and if
there is one guy out of 10 it's not
going to compensate they win a half in
average thinking that average multile of
Bluffs but slightly over Bluff and so
the main difference with this thinking
in theory is in theory there is no
discrepancy of the EVS so there is not
like massive loss massive win and so the
the overall EV we understand that
sometimes in the it's going to be zero
and it's not about people like under
bluffing because sometimes you're going
to play against population at over
Bluffs but with the discrepancy you
understand of like yeah when they over
Bluff you win one blind but when they
don't Bluff you lose 60 blinds for
example um and so thinking this way on
the river like this framework of
thinking okay what's the most important
scenarios is the most important because
you will
understand
um you will understand if if you don't
uh teach with me uh for do me you will
understand there are some patterns like
precise patterns that like happens all
the time time were like okay let's say
most people like have Bluffs but people
will sometimes not have Bluff in spots
while it's actually not a good call
often because the person not having
Bluff uh is is um is too important to
the EV you have overall so it's not
going to be profitable even if most
people uh let's say overbluff a little
bit and there are some other spots like
say you play against players who like
you just like don't don't blop check
turn like pot River for example the way
he played it play Such in an unbalanced
way he's never going to have his values
and his bluff he's either going to have
values or you're going to face someone
only having Bluffs and so he changed the
discrepancy because now it's either you
win the wall pots or you lose what he
puts in the middle the bats Bally and so
now it's completely different because
even if sometimes I can be always it's
even if sometimes I can be always behind
yes but um is going to be some thing
where I'm going to be always ahead and
if I'm always ahead it will compensate
the loss I have when I'm way behind and
so some some type of catching spots are
way more profitable to go than other
ones and the last one I said was like
free b or fre B pots um in this scenario
I'm going to be start your head often
against let say
the pool but some people are not going
to have Bluffs unless they don't have
Bluff it it affects maybe too much and
it can be compensated by the St cities
of people where I'm slightly ahead of
zero um and it's different than the
spots I just said where like yes
sometimes he's only going to have values
but when he only have Bluffs heily
compensate the have when he only have
values yeah also because when he only
have BL you win the PO plus his bed
basically which yeah so this is how I
thing for Bluff catching bluffing um Fu
areas yeah yeah I think going through
that process you did there I could see
your memory skills and how you learn
memory uh coming in there you me
organizing there you're organizing
what's most important with these set of
questions you were simplifying to some
degree you're going what information is
important what's not in kind of
prioritizing that and you're making
associations with like the player pool
how people generally play to make a good
decision I think because you've got such
a clear simplified thought process the
longer you take the more time you can go
through those kind of linear sequence of
questions where I feel like other
players might not have that structure
way of thinking so you give some players
a Time Bank on a river and they're just
going to go around and say Les just
going has he got this has he got that
and they kind of just back and forth
second guess themselves but for you
because your thoughts are so clear as a
hierarchy of decision making you was was
like tick through your list so yeah if
anyone who's maybe struggling with their
River decisions or decisions in general
maybe going through your thought process
and trying to really organize them so
youve got a clear hierarchy of questions
to ask yourself to go through so when
you're in these situations it's just a
system to go through which it sounds
like you've got very well dialed in the
problem of people is like they let's say
they face a decision to have a SP they
put it into the thinking process and
they lead to decision the problem about
that is I can say a lot of things in the
middle just not good so this will leads
to the like wrong thing to do um
sometimes the right thing obviously um
with the the systems obviously it's you
can't do it like for all decisions um
because you can do it for all decisions
but for specific decision like this on
the river it's like way easier to do is
okay you estimated what's the what's the
EV discrepancy what's uh all the thing
we discussed about and okay l in the
sports where like most people like who
to all people have always the value
hands and Bluffs and sometimes they
don't have Bluffs if you recognize this
type of situation you know that in
average you can't win because as soon as
someone is not bluffing you lose so much
that it can't compensate DV wins when
people over Bluff and what I do in this
spot for example is instead of like
having a big thinking process I'm just
thinking okay is this this uh this tion
like you had over zero way behind under
zero type of spots and if it is I
fold I'm not even thinking about this so
we start we we go from like having a
process to a decision but now I want to
understand that uh am I in this correct
distribution so I can take the decision
right away and and so the the key to
understand about that is now the only
mistakes I can do is not um analyzing it
the distri distribution well because if
I analyze the distribution well I took
the best decision because I know that
the best decision is f and let's say I
played in sports where I play against a
fish is either like only going to have
value or only going to have pluss then
the decision process is going to change
and actually in this um distribution
sometimes called sometimes full it's a
little bit more complicated but I know
that like I have this framework where
like okay I identify one situation that
is like similar to situations and if
it's the case and like I take the best
decision and the only I can do now is
like in term of like not really
understanding it
um um the distribution well
yeah yeah I think it comes down to you
got to understand something on a deep
level and it gets quite complicated for
a period before you can simplify to know
what matters to know actually uh how to
uh make make a shortcut so to speak but
without costing yourself so you
mentioned this kind of a Tob kind of
analogy of making a decision or thinking
about a spot then making decision and as
you mentioned there's a lot of kind of
wiggle room in the middle which you've
got to think through you've got to
organize you've got to get clear on what
actually matters then once you
understand at a high level it sounds
like for you it's like oh one of these
parts awesome that just puts me here and
then you can make a very quick decision
because you know the factors that that
really matter so yeah very lot of food
for thought there and I'm sure the
listeners will be thinking about their
own thought process and how to maybe
fine tune it I want to dive in now to
your mental game you mentioned mental
game has been a bit of a challenge for
you so I'm curious to know how that's
created issues for you moving up sticks
and yes some the obstacles youve run
into with with your mental
game um I think the I have a mental
coach since like two years and a half
very good guy french guy Nam luron um
the the problem I have with the mtal
games two things is like when I lose and
when I do mistakes the first one is when
I do mistakes and I never succeed to
develop an effective way to like
supported it and there was a lot of
times where like I was doing a mistakes
I knew I would I shouldn't do I was like
so silly that I had to stop the session
and it's actually happened quite a lot
back in the days uh now a bit less
because I think montal game is sometimes
um it's something you like learn at a
deeper level so can takes a lot of time
sometimes to improve I'm tell me if I'm
wrong um so I improve on that but like
yeah back in the days it was very
difficult because I didn't have any I
didn't have the skill to like I'm being
resilient in continue and yeah sometimes
I was I start the session I lose two or
three binds and not happy to lose I just
stopped the session and I know it sounds
unprofessional but the problem is if I
continue like I I I just I could have
played well it's not like a tiled play
I'm never going to be tilted when I play
but I just feel very bad emotions and
these emotions were always tough to
manage and that's why I like tend to
stop sometimes session super fast uh
because because of that so um it affects
more like the way I played after like in
term of like studing I don't think I had
too many like mental issues I would say
but yeah learning that was the two main
problem you had and uh yeah this yeah
you mentioned the the two biggest
obstacles that most players run into for
a mindset which is losing making
mistakes almost everything comes
Downstream of those two variables so how
did you start to deal with them let's
start with losing so part of the game
the variance of no matter how good you
get no matter how amazing your
decisionmaking machine is you're going
to have to deal with losing so for you
what what have been some of the most
valuable lessons you've learned to allow
you to handle losing better I'm going to
say something a bit controvert but I
think people need to be massively
rented uh I think the problem of saying
you need to be not rented obviously
sometimes yes but what all like the
sometimes it's really important to
wonder is it really cool or not you know
like oh I play uh I fall B Kings he has
Aces pre flop uh cooler yeah but I mean
you are big blind against early position
you know maybe people don't really F at
much this position okay what's when he
only have Aces okay you lose 80 blanks
okay what's you when he has AC and Aces
okay we whatever 20 lines oh but if this
first scenario is going to happen Less
almost you know and like when you ask
this question sometimes the answer will
be yes it's a cooler but sometimes you
will not and if you like not this fault
process and you say oh this is a cooler
oh okay this is a cool I lose and you
don't go further like okay but what is
it really a cooler like for example you
will start to develop some thinking and
pay attention to other things so
sometimes I got situations where like
yeah but I really didn't like to lose uh
and I and I start to think oh maybe I I
can find those information so I start
thinking more about timing Ts for
example and I noticed that yeah my hand
is like clear C inory but when this guy
like but so fast he's like often having
it so I obviously I started to call and
I was tilted because my thinking was
right about the timing but really being
it's up you develop this thinking
process of really deeply thinking is the
hand was well played on like could you
have make the fall and obviously at the
end it's better not to be earned too
much but it's very important to have
this process of saying okay oh let's say
bet he called me this um oh instead of
saying like oh he's dumbb no he's not
dumb maybe he called this because of a
reason and so okay why did he call This
And and you sort of create this path of
thinking that like makes you improve the
decision uh as much as you can and so
even in my game this day I'll still be
reg oriented let's say F he has a good
bluff catcher he had it to cool and I
know he's more like AAL players what
what going to do like it's okay but okay
let's say sometimes okay he he t a lot
with a hand that should have call was in
value okay why he should why he Ted a
lot uh maybe he thinks that I'm um I'm a
bit too nitty maybe he some stuff on my
timing and it really helps you like
question yourself all the time and and I
I'm really um really sure about that
there are way way way less coolers Than
People thinks and sometimes people just
click on the go button but I don't
understand the things I just say before
compared to Theory um the EV chains are
very important to understand because as
soon as you have someone's not bluffing
enough and not bluffing at all you're
actually losing so massive that it's
very difficult to compensate if you play
against like somehow most Balan ranges
most people bur Stranges yeah yeah I
think lessons from Leen is the main
thing there like how to extract lessons
and go deeper when you see a loss and I
think looking there for what assumptions
aren't correct like have I made some
false assumptions here I I assume and
this is how it plays out and every time
you lose when it's painful it's an
opportunity to either gloss over it to
get two sucked into you've lost and
feeling bad about it but there's also a
doorway that opens going interesting
that didn't play out the way I wanted to
is there something to learn here I think
understanding that every uh loss can be
an opportunity to to tap into that so
the second one you mentioned was
mistakes I'm guessing mistakes can be
taken the same way as in how to to learn
from them so yeah talk about how you've
improved your relationship with making
mistakes this is like a really big one
especially when you cast yourself as
quite a smart person you pride yourself
on being good at poker making mistakes
just hurt just suck so how have you been
able to better handle mistakes and use
them more
practially I want to say something a
little bit funny this year I started to
uh train a little bit relation with
girls so um I did some stuff where like
with coaches and friends we were like
going in the streets but I actually
didn't really like doing it actually
hated doing it uh and so we are
approaching a woman um and uh Theo was
trying to on date and um what I learned
is sometimes you do mistakes and you
will do so much mistakes you can even
still be bad after the mistakes and so
when I when I like trained this a lot
this year and actually I was really bad
and still very bad it's it's not the not
my best trange I I learned that like
there are some area in in my life like I
can train a lot do mistakes I'm not
going to improve so I need to be
grateful for the ARA of my life where I
do mistakes and I improve in this one
and in poker for example I I I become
what I became I become I become what I
become what I am because like I did so
many mistakes I could have improved on
otherwise I will not and there are some
areas where I can do like an infinite
amount of mistakes until very bad and it
really helped me understand like and and
just reg grateful of the mistakes I do
because uh when you only focus about the
poker mistakes you are stuck in this
area where like you're like oh I do
mistakes I would like to do less
mistakes but you don't even understand
that some area you can do like 1,000
mistakes without even a single
Improvement like very few and so when
you start to understand that um mistakes
are here to help you on your way that of
for things that are important for you
obviously it's um it's a way more
effective way to to see the the mistakes
problem they all
problems how do you make sure you are
learning from mistakes I think one of
the frustration players have is that
they see themselves making mistakes that
they should have fixed they're like I've
already worked on this I should this
could I shouldn't be making this mistake
right here right now I know this is a
bad call yet here I am calling again how
do you make sure these moments become
the learn opportunity that they're meant
to be and it's actually a repeated
pattern as you mentioned sometimes we
make the same mistake a thousand times
and don't learn and that's the most
frustrating so how do you make sure in
the part context that when you are Mak
mistakes it does become something that
you learn from you cannot you you will
do mistakes that you will do 10 20 times
before fixing again poke is like a
language uh let's say you say a sentence
uh is not this is wrong and you say it
again it's going to be right but you
can't be right for the whole time I
think we got this vision from school
where like you do mistakes then you
don't do the mistakes and after it's
better you can't like going to do
mistakes I did some call shitty C like
where times for not doing it 100 times
not not one two tens hundreds and it's
very important to understand that the
it's not it's not binary like I do
mistakes I fixed this and sometimes
mistakes takes a lot of time to be fixed
and uh when you accept the time it takes
it um it also makes you um like um in a
better relation with the mistakes like
if back in the days I was like do saying
to myself yeah but it's it's normal like
accept that it's normal it's a normal
situ ation um I would have I would have
less problems with doing mistakes I
would have it less because I would have
understood that it's um super important
part of the world process um I think
would have helped me quite a lot yeah I
love that yeah I think as well accepting
that it's not fixed yet because
sometimes players are getting call in
Narrative of I shouldn't be doing this
it's like well news flash you just did
it now well it's not fixed yet so get on
with it and I think that's like of I've
done the work I've worked on this this
problem should be gone it's like nope
sometimes it takes 20 50 100 repetitions
to uh to solidify and as he mentions as
long as you're intentional I think
you've got to as he mention because some
people don't learn for mistakes ever is
because they like all another mistake
another mistake you got to have
intentionality to go that isn't good
enough yet how can I improve going
forward it's like reinforce the it's not
quite fixed yet so let's say you're
mispronouncing a word or you're going to
speak to a girl and you get rejected
every time and then you go back to 100
girls with the same chat up line it's
like you got rejected 100 times well
done it's like you need to somehow learn
that okay I need to actually be more
intentional what went wrong how can I
prove this what is the what am I missing
here why did this mistake come up again
for the 80th time and why have not got
past it yet without without judging and
that's the balance of accepting it but
also intentionality mistakes don't just
disappear you've got to put something in
to fix them as well I no I just wanted
to to repeat why I would say but it's
very true and for me the most important
for poers you understand are some other
areas where like mistakes improve way
less in the poker area so like always
like be grateful understand that like
this type of mistakes that you're doing
sometimes just takes a lot of time to to
be

with me looking forward to educating you
guys over there but without further Ado
let's continue more goodness in today's
episode for you what have been some of
the most important habits or routines
that you've developed that have allowed
you to uh get more balance but also
perform at a better level maybe this
happiness EV performance EV kind of
tying together so like the habits that
you've developed over the years that
have been very valuable for
you well Sports I think is probably the
most important I I also walk one one
hour a day um so it really helps me to
refresh my thoughts a little bit it's
tough really to explain like what
happened when you walk but um yeah I
always feel uh feel more fresh after it
um I also had a study of writing the
book so it's been since 2016 I'm doing
this uh every day now I do I do more
audio notes uh and sometimes I not do it
every day I do it for like every each
day so like let's say you didn't do it
for five days I will do the five days in
a row uh and it really helped me having
this like back vision of my life so uh
and it really helped me like support
better the the things I was um experien
ing because let's say okay I'm going a d
swing speaking about it and seeing
yourself from the third person is always
great because it's um it allow you to
have a better angle of things that um
that you are leaving uh and really
helped me a lot and there also some
other things like meditation helped me a
lot but always really difficult to have
the Abit so I never had the abits of
like doing it consistently and um yeah I
think this the two main there no like
very it is too
M yeah I'm interested in this one of
kind of reflecting and giving yourself
advice or notes on yourself I think you
mention you did it as an audio do you
combine those two behaviors of walking
and like taking like some notes for the
for the day and talk about like how that
kind of looks because I think some
people will relate to wanting to get
things off their mind to things they're
learning and yeah how do you practically
do that what is was the kind
of yeah the journaling was very sorry Ed
journaling for like four years and after
did a notes uh but the journaling part
was really reflecting on my life wasn't
it wasn't for poker or like learning
specifically something that's really
okay why do I leave the day uh because I
actually I ate uh don't not remembering
things maybe that's also I train memory
unconsciously so I always wanted to know
what I did on the day so like if I want
to see years later well I'll see back
and it helped me also if it was not
doing well so I was in high school and I
really ated as school as stuff um and so
it it helped me reflecting helped me to
understand that like I I will face
difficulties uh I'll face some
challenges is normal and having this
like third vision is like better to um
support and be resilient on so let's say
um uh you have you have pain physical
pain for example a physical problem um
writing it and um like putting Wars what
you're really feeling is a better way to
support uh the thing you're currently
challenging uh and so it was way better
for me for like all the little challenge
I had and also bigger challenge I had to
um to have this like third Vision uh
knowing that you know it's it's a part
of my life and writing it doing audio
notes well sometimes I have little
problem but I remember that I I wrote
some bigger pode in the past so this one
is a
little it's just a little problem and
it's uh also helped you um putting
things in the right orders and not like
over focusing on something that is
actually not a very big
problem yeah I'm curious to know is
there any kind of system to this so you
can reflect in a lot of ways you can
reflect on what went well today what
have been the biggest things I've run
into or you can reflect on like areas
like areas of your life that you're
performing not performing feeling good
not feeling good so I'm cu for you as
youve been doing this for a long time
have you got any sort of like things you
reflect on more frequently in terms of
your system for doing this maybe you
reflect on your life choices maybe
reflecting on how your feeling so
anything that comes to mind for that um
I think it's very there are a few things
like this year but like the for the past
years it depends on the exact per so
let's say I will have my final exam I
will talk a lot about the final exam I'm
going to have um let's say I have
something very important that I will
need to do I will talk about this I if I
played poker on the day I will talk
about poker so um I'll talk to my stuff
obviously uh about poers it's very um
not like too many specific things but
there are some pars and for example
these pars the defaults I had more more
more these days are more about like
sacrifices I I don't and I regret doing
it because I like lost things that were
important to me um and uh yeah this this
comeb backs often and and it's cool
because uh when you do this you really
understand like what's important for you
because naturally defaults uh comeb
backs and as you said yeah sometimes you
you notice that okay this subject comeb
backs uh po probably come backs a little
bit less than before and it really helps
you understanding okay what's really the
most important thing not in one a your
node but let's say on the months and you
you reflect okay I didn't talk too much
about that for example and now this day
I talk more about uh relationship also
I'm more interested about health stuffs
um like in term of like elimation and
yeah just help you understand like um
how do you move through your life and
what do you prioritize the
most yeah I'm thinking myself I want to
maybe start this habit of maybe doing
daily audio notes of reflecting things
on my mind you could then get that audio
note transcribed you could put in a chat
TBT and go one of the most thing things
I've talked about the most this month
because hey you're talking a lot about
your relationships so a lot about poke
goals and kind of try to condense that
because as you mentioned there's this
element of organizing stuff which I
think is often a Miss in piece so
there's a capturing like there's
capturing a note and I always think like
that what next myself I always struggled
when there's not a what next even
journaling sometimes when I journaled a
lot and it was like where I was going I
wasn't looking back on the notes it was
just a it was a nice practice I did
enjoy for a periods but now I like more
the practicality of what did I learn
from that period so for you yeah kind of
taking these audio notes it feels like
it could be a good way to yeah reflect
on what's important and it's one of
those things like we're kind of
Blindsided to bit we' got a lot of blind
spots in what's important we're kind of
making these little trade-offs in the
moments and sometimes we're getting them
wrong and we're sacrificing things that
matter for things that don't matter and
like over time you start to see those
patterns and go wait a second I say
these things are important but I'm
spending no time on it I've fat over
waste look like a mess yeah I keep
saying that health is the most important
thing for me what what's going on here
how do I recalibrate so I really feel
like this consistent repetition of build
awareness seems like you're really
really good practice I I personally I
don't calculate uh I do more like um um
without calculate the the amount of time
I speak about each subject I'm it's more
like a okay like I I talk about things
okay what I talk about for example and
um but in more like a natural way not
not really calcc it and also I do this
to project myself sometimes I'm going to
have something to do or something is
really important to me I a new goal as a
notes help me um it just don't talk
about that protecting myself
understanding the difficulties I can
have so like what will happen if it if
it happens like what's the benefits and
uh yeah it it also help me like
projecting myself and and sometimes just
great to visualizing what you need to do
in order to achieve something and
sometimes actually I do some Moos I just
say what I do on the day and there's no
like very like super important things
sometimes I don't even say what I do on
the day I speak about something for 10
minutes it's very variable I would say I
just let the freedom of what I want to
do in
so I love it yeah yeah I think it's the
element of just allowing you to get
things out of your mind and often we
think better through either writing it
out or speaking it out it's really hard
to like go through lots of thoughts it's
in your mind you often need a an outlet
for those thoughts to condense them to
uh to understand what's actually uh um
going through your mind and to condense
things so yeah really really like that I
think it's a very useful practice that a
lot of people could do either writing or
audio I think both work very well Rene
for yourself do you have any form of
regular reflecting any journaling or
anything you're currently doing I've
actually experimented with both uh for
the for the audio notes you can actually
make a WhatsApp group uh invite someone
have a three-way and then Le the other
one out and then you have a WhatsApp
group with yourself that's really
helpful so you can just drop audiio
there for the people who want who want a
way to do it uh journaling I've
experimented with in various ways as
well uh if I have a continuous thought
or feeling that comes up I like to just
sit down and grab a piece of paper and
write down the feelings that say I I
constantly feel anxiety I write down
anxiety and just start writing around it
sometimes I have to go to a second page
because you know and then you start to
think oh wait but then and then you
start to link and you need more pages to
to get to kind of the source the problem
but then after an hour of writing
everything out and you kind of zoom out
and you see on paper like huh so that's
what that's what's been bothering me you
know but if you don't write it down it
keeps on looping in your head you know
and you cannot really break it uh so
yeah I found that to be very helpful
um so yeah would would definitely
definitely recommend you guys talked
about uh yeah an insane amount of
interesting things I don't want to
repeat too much I wanted to jump in
straight to something that uh you y said
that a lot of people uh you you say
theory is important but also you don't
want to use it too much so I was
wondering what's the theory that is
important and you need to apply and when
does it become too much
um so for me two things in theory
there's what you what the solver is
doing in the spots and what's the
concepts um in exact spot that you can
use and there you need to be understand
in a way that as like concept so can be
MDF polarization merge whatever and you
need to understand exactly uh what's
going on so okay why when orang is polar
why do we take the bigger size for
example okay one why on the River Line
when he bet b i don't def an MDF for
example and really understand all
theorical Concepts uh will help you
understand better like how the game
works and it's very important to have
like very solid understanding of all
these questions and don't have like one
single concept that is not clear to you
uh if you don't really understand
Equalization understanding it well uh
because it will help you with this clear
thoughts will obviously help you in the
more in the explorative game because if
it's very Sol the teral game uh let's
say the teral game is like um it's a
fortress uh if the Fortress is like
let's say really big um when you go
house of the Fortress to exploit people
if the Fortress is really big and you
have a lot of homes to do this uh it's
going to be easier for you to go and and
and try to exploit people word so but um
and if the the tal foundations are not
solid uh you have way less effective
ways to defend yourself and and just
like exploit people and attack people
basically uh so yeah it's very important
and in term of knowing what's the solver
is doing I think it will constantly do
the work of thinking what's the terrain
this situation and after try to deviate
from what you learn and for me is the
best uh way to proceed because um as we
discussed before if you only do theory
is a problem and if you only do exploit
it's a problem because you can't exploit
someone if you don't know what the is
doing you can but not in an optimal way
and so you you always need both and it's
tough to answer exactly like how much
how much exploit you need I would say
against Ral players 90% exploits 95
which means you're not going to play
theal you're going to think thly and um
if you play against the W um I would say
um 20% 30% other exploits because
there's like passive exploits and active
exploits there exploit like oh I think
he's not going to do this so inting it
and you can exct based on the things you
show show on or information you have on
this guy okay this guy when he's
thinking uh 15 seconds and it goes into
his time back only one seconds of his
extra time back and he J he's always Liv
value and so F and this is a specific
read I have on the opponent and I but I
can also exploit things more in a way oh
I think when I do this the population
will uh like um react this way if I
don't have enough information of the guy
I can putting in the sets of the
population uh and playing against like
if I play against population but as soon
as I have like way more precise way to
exploit him I will exploit him more like
actively directly and still like knowing
what the T will do but I will focus more
way more on the exploit let's say I play
against a very strong player I don't
know then obviously I will focus a
little bit more about t see what
mistakes is he's doing see what mistakes
is he doing and after attacking his his
mistakes yeah I think it's always
important first question to to think
about is always who am I playing against
but because the answer to that question
will really depend how you're going to
think for the rest of the hand right so
uh like like you said obviously the
tougher your opponent the more of a
let's say GTO strategy you implement for
me that's also a very big distinction
you have the solver and you can learn
how I see it you can learn two things
from the solver you can learn what a GTO
strategy looks like or you can learn
what drives what poker Theory Concepts
drivve the GTO strategy so there you
have the theory and you have a GTO
strategy and in my opinion theory always
applies right but you might not execute
the GTO strategy you might do actually
you take a different action because
you're opponent is is do you're not so
interested in playing a GTO strategy
right you're deviating from that but you
can still apply certain theoretical
Concepts in terms of the BET size that
you choose or the hand that you choose
in a certain line which can all be
driven around certain theoretical
Concepts you mentioned already that uh
you can't do too much of one thing and
the other now you have like very Theory
oriented camps that are like I don't
care what you do I'm just going to play
my version of GTO you know and if you
don't want to Bluff or if you want to
over Bluff you do you and they have the
other guys who are you know handed data
sheets MDA and they go full on that what
are we talked already a little bit about
the theory
um in terms of exploitation how do you
get better I know MDA is very popular
but it seems like you have good reads
but it comes more from understanding
Theory and therefore you're able to
exploit or are you also in in the MDA
Camp um I would say I'm not in the MDA
Camp I don't think it's bad um I think
if it's used well it's great but I think
if it's not used well it's [ __ ] so how
do you it well what's what's like an
example of using it well using it
okay from the world sh but um for me the
the way you need to use MDA is sports
where it's obviously it's very obvious
that the population is doing something
then you exploit them but one is all
like
the the the data points are not relevant
enough compared to the you are not doing
anything because okay let's say I play B
check BS um I know that the PO is over I
say random numbers is over bluffing by
5% so I'm going to call the big big big
problem about this it it defocus you too
much about the game and you just follow
shits and yeah it's a cool but the guy
just snap bats and when his guy snap
bats he always have Ali so the call is
actually losing seven but because you
not then you follow shits you're going
to say oh okay my co is winning but it's
actually losing a lot and the problem is
um in games of way too much informations
for me that will make you um divert from
the Sheets if you know what the guy is
doing a little bit so let's say I play
against a no population playing with MGA
it's going to work better than not
probably but as soon as they have one
information about one guy so let's say
he's not valuating scene enough why I'm
following [ __ ] anymore because these
shits are not relevant for this specific
guy and from me you you always have if
you want enough information on the guy
to take better decisions than with shits
and when you don't have obviously you
can use MDA and it's not not good and
not bad I think you know like if someone
says like one thing is super important
and it's the only thing like let's say
ter is the only thing or MD is the only
thing or X is the only thing like in
general they want to sell something uh
but it's very difficult to like uh you
know find someone saying Okay only thing
is very important in like uh be very
good at it uh at the game because you
you always need like all elements I
think it can be good without MJ I think
MJ is definitely a good tool but I think
it's probably a little bit um people
overestimated I think a little bit and
it's very obviously if it's used well
it's a good tool but I think too many
players just use it as okay I look at my
shet uh I'm not really looking enough
about the player OB because obviously
most people will look about the other
player but not enough and so that take
decisions are not optimal and I'll
finish about that on the subject the the
big big big problem about MGA is it's
switch the game between thinking
actively about what's the best option to
okay remembering what's the best option
in average so it's like kind of the same
thing as Terry you're going to say oh
this this thing is a call I call but you
don't Focus about elements you have in
game oh maybe he bet three quarter and
he have he sizing by two blinds and and
maybe when people doing this it's a bit
more value of uh and with this
information I will fall whereas the MD
guy and show guy will make the call as
they will like lose money obviously
sometimes I will like pay attention to a
detail I'm going to be completely wrong
so I'm going to lose money by thinking
I'm exploiting because it's a balance
sometimes going to win sometimes going
to lose but in average and on the long
run you wi way more thinking deeply
about what you do simply because you
take better decision and you have a way
more effective uh thinking process and
it's still something you can develop
following sheets so obiously always try
to use um each things um in a balanc way
y yeah so what I'm kind of getting from
you and I definitely agree it's not
necessarily what you decide to use it's
more how you use it and exactly you know
especially especially uh I I completely
agree with you because if you go full on
theory for on NDA you're no longer
thinking about what's actually going on
you're no long trying to figure out
anymore what your opponent has which in
the end figure out what your opponent
has you know will have quite quite a big
consequence to what your best EV play
will be and you know you image exactly
right there's there's more to that but
then usually what the MDA Camp kind of
gives as feedback uh or think a reason
why for example a lot of big stables and
stuff they go for more MDA approach
because it's hard so poker is hard right
and therefore they now try to simplify
it into sheets so they can teach more
people and therefore these Stables can
make more money where I I I have mixed
feelings on that on one side I do think
it allows maybe some people that
otherwise for example wouldn't be able
to P 200l canot suddenly play online
poker for a living you know and that's
great uh because I usually hear the
argument that if you teach people all
these variables for example that you
take in consideration that I take in
consideration it's just too much it's
too senstive to bias people people just
uh struggle a lot
to form a good decision making process
right and therefore they prefer to just
hand them than the
sheets Right theory and actually solving
the puzzle is more complicated and more
senstive to bias less consistency then
just always press call always press
fault exactly so like people um people
think oh it's tougher to do so I'm going
to have less visual doing it and it's
easier to like follow [ __ ] off lary but
it's not the way you maximize on the
short and the long run as we discussed
and I think also by the way if for
example I've used a lot of MD as well
the the way that I always do it I still
ask myself just like with studying GTO
strategy and Theory why why why why why
try to really understand it at a deeper
level instead of just learning the
sheets because when you understand it on
the deeper level you know when and why
but most importantly you know when not
and why not right so you can still make
those deviations in game based on new
information that come your way and it's
the same like people say oh uh I review
hands with for example the same guy
consistently and every time he like I
say yeah depends on the information he
say oh but I don't have any other
information then he say well in the
beginning it's fine okay you have no
other information you should now do X
because we don't have information but
you should start Gathering more
information this is something that
people don't do right because in the end
the more information you have the better
place you can make so people have to
actually look and try to gather more
information that's something that's step
that a lot of players I think we have
kind of a similar post on this and and
what I liked when I was watching your
videos you you always ask yourself where
does DV come from and so sometimes you
say a lot and it's typically that like
where does DV come from and when you ask
yourself the question it force you to
think because it doesn't come from
Theory it doesn't come from blind
exploit it doesn't come from NBA or
whatever and it really put you in the
thinking process and we discuss the B
lady how important it for your brain to
think it by yourself so you can develop
a better level and a better
understanding at how the game works
against humans Yeah by asking these type
of questions you actually learn you tell
a question then your brain starts to
look out oh wait what is this range
actually well let's actually think about
this for a second and then you suddenly
start to see things that you know you
were not seeing before you mentioned
something earlier where he said the game
is too big so I guess with MDA you know
and trying to make simplified strategies
we always try to kind of make this big
game a bit
smaller let's let's try to help our
audience let's try to prioritize um
things that people should take in
consideration right we could give them
sheets but we don't want to so let's try
to help them structure their fault
process you already talked a little bit
about um you know you just called one
that I like to use where should my value
come from you already talked about uh
spotting situations and with there in
which there is a e uh discription see
all distributed you uh does he have
value hands these are certain questions
do you could you maybe give our audience
uh like a couple of uh guidelines of
what they should be taking into
consideration doing a hand
yeah um so the first is the profile of
the
opponent uh obviously um I mean it's two
obvious so we don't say no no but but
hey man people forget this one man or
like I said people don't even label
people anymore you know yeah who who's
the guy you're playing uh second will um
yeah second will be how the guy per of
you like so do you have a per Dage to
this guy and um I will wonder like minor
things like okay obviously what do I
think is the best currently and I'll
always try and it's very important to
project yourself through the hands I see
too many players say okay I'm going to
use a big S on the Flop to play pressure
yeah but you can just like bet smaller
and apply pressure later so he can raise
his stronger hands and so I I said to
project yourself on the average re R
outs it allows you to take like better
decisions through the wall end and also
I will ask myself doeses the
eccentricity I can do will work in this
guy so I say some treaties typically for
the bed sizing so uh okay is this guy
gonna like overfall the river Rays or
overall the river over BS and if the if
it's the case and like yeah probably
better to check the turn no or B the
rever like rise if you bets uh and
always try to ask yourself um like
questions that can be helpful F the
hands for example let's say we're in a
hand uh I have a bluff and the most
important question you need to ask
yourself if you want to BL the turn is
all the hands that fold turn or check in
the turn and fall in the river if you
play all the position for example uh it
can be also like okay um is a guy in
elastic to
my sizing so if I do a little bigger
that's equal also uh and I will ask
myself this the most important question
what's the most certain action to take
if I have to bet my entire house on
what's the best action what will I
choose and when you think this way you
start to have a more um a game with less
mistakes and the goal of Poker is
actually doing less mistakes than your
opponents it's not about doing better
mov it's just doing about um less
mistakes because mistakes are more
costly than what uh EES bring by a
better move so when you ask yourself
this you start to develop a game where
like you are going to fix the weaker the
bigger mistakes and you can't do very
big mistakes because let's say I play a
line with like a check rise a flop check
raise again and like just Le small free
B I mean this is random line while with
this thinking process and with the goal
of playing more conservative I'm never
going to play this line so obviously
sometimes I'm going to like some EVS
because actually it was great with chis
chis mean that's PR bad uh but as often
it's not going to be good and let's say
I'm in spots where I'm saying okay it's
close we can do whatever I always take
what I think in out R will be the was
will be the best uh um will the best
move to do because it's how you maximize
R average and this is how the uh the EV
Works basically because as soon as you
do mistakes it's in general way more
costly than doing a move that's working
the reason why is because when you do a
move that is working is also as a move
that works that don't have this down
side of mistakes or actually have less
chance to have them so um I'll tend to
always ask myself how to play more
conservative it doesn't mean you need to
be in it because sometimes I know people
overfall here so I'm always going to put
Max pressure and over 10 spot uh if if I
need it's really about uh having this
consistency of like thinking through a
plan and of like letting random thoughts
and random thinging process leading to a
decision you're not in sure enough about
yeah yeah and I also feel like if you
try to find the best play everywhere you
know it's it can it can go wrong quite
often like I feel like when there is
sort of a a genius play you know it
feels more intuitive it's like ah you
know straightway comes up it's like a
this is a good spot for this I actually
have a very similar philosophy but I
call it more try to make the play that
can't be bad so instead of focus on
trying to make
I focus on what the that be bad let's
try to not screw up right because if you
screw up less then exactly like poker
game of mistakes make less mistakes on
your opponent and you will win sometimes
bit a bit too focused on what's like the
perfect play and yeah then you you will
if if the rack is not eight blinds per
in yeah exactly that that that that that
that that then that can work else we
have to start the make perfect plays
everywhere I was wondering like uh
throughout your your climb uh which
which stake uh which jumpering stake did
you find the
[Music]
toughest I think online is I think one L
like um going for the gap between is it
50 I think it was 50nl actually yeah 50
NL because 50 NL is the limits for like
if you go to 100 NL there like pros and
20 L there's no Pros so really like the
transitional limits and it was the one
that was the toughest for me was the n50
and after you know after like each limit
is a little bit tougher but it's not for
me the biggest Gap is between 50 and um
uh is 50 and low F and when you reach
high stakes let's say you make the jump
from uh 1K to 5K you know in the past
when there were still GG you had 1K and
they made the jump to 5K yeah
GG the time where it's gone the the
seade you remember in the past when you
know GG had 1K and then you had VIP
games at 5K you remember that by what
was the difference between jet jump when
we made that jump in in the past like
what set that those games apart from for
example uh a grind at Mid
Stakes um like what's the difference
yeah what sets the players at those
games apart from the guys who play mid
[Music]
Stakes I I think it's just way more
experience like uh one I was playing
zero like full time when recruit um I
play against scy play since like 10 12
sometimes even more like 14 years and
so experience is the first thing the
second thing is a deep understanding of
theory it's super rare to see like very
big theorical mistakes uh and in general
like if someone's not doing the right
size on the Flop like he's D Lael and I
know like he will not win um for example
should depend on the Flop
um or this and uh yeah just also like
way way less scared most people like e
want to do I mean I have some shs on
Instagram like sometimes I I BL second
pair he called second pair with the with
just a
biter like the directly just let's get
now right and also like most these there
some people like more like Chinese
Japanese like a little bit more tight
and weaker not R players like maybe like
life Pros as a lot of like weaker
players like this um yeah I would say
that's the the main difference but it's
not um I think it was tougher in 2022
than it was just before the the
lockdown 5K table just to explain
because maybe people don't know uh we
can't play uh 5K Plus on GG now publicly
you need to either H games or um go in
this game I don't know it works uh I
mean I will see because maybe I can also
Som
play but yeah I found it really crazy
and
very it's it scared me a little bit
about the future of online obviously now
I'm debating way more toward live games
and also of foras and not all them but I
think now playing 5K plus and want to
make a living of 5K plus is kind of dead
actually because I don't think on a
pokar and Co you can have enough enough
volumes just to to play have sufficient
win rates maybe it will it will go off
this years but um yeah I find it really
crazy that what GG did it's not like bad
or Goods just like Z all business so
they want to maximize The Profit but
sounds crazy to me how we can maximize
profits with private games it's nobody's
playing there empty all the time you
have uh you do have experience you
already mentioned that you've been
dabbling a bit more in the live scene
and now live scene you know there is a
lot of problem uh like a lot of um how
do you call this a lot of politics a lot
of private games so uh tell me a little
bit about your transition into into life
poker okay so the first transition I had
to life poker was in 2022 where I went
to Philippines uh I already played a
little bit in France and in Philippines
I played still play in 510 uh remember
the first session what of the best
session I did I think I won like 12
buing or something uh really great I met
one guy that advised me to go on a
private game and he took me action on
this game so I was thinking that okay
the game is safe and Stu and the guy was
the son of the owner of the game okay
was a Korean guy and this game was in um
uh I don't about the city SIU I think in
Philippines and
um it was a private game in a casino
okay so I went there and uh they let me
play with them was Korean Chinese
Japanese people Philippines people also
uh Philippians people because the son of
the owner bring me in the game but the
owner didn't know that his son uh took
actions and it will be important later
so I started playing into this game um I
played first day it was 1020 but like
everybody has like Stacks between 10 and
20K so I was taking 10K and uh first day
I lost 10 so like I play flip uh
was like I don't remember but I have
like plus one of a got to or k care um
and he call I lose okay second day uh I
don't remember exactly but again I lose
like 12 and third day I lose like 17 so
now I'm like I think it's a it's a bit
weird uh and I really didn't uh at this
time was not even believing it could be
rigged because the son action on me uh
and so yeah as I Contin playing the game
and I just didn't know like I was just
not winning the all in l i was winning a
lot like I just crushing all the guys
but the all in when he goes to well flop
I was literally never winning like never
and I play some dumb pots like 40K pot I
have Ace King gu have Ace King have A6
and I guys makes trips like and it was
this like this over and over and so I
thought it was I was just really unlucky
in the spots and what happened is the
fourth day I say to people like okay if
I lose I quit and obviously I won
177,000 H and um day five to day 10 I I
lost in total I lost like a
ATK and what was funny is I say to the
owner that his son had action on me and
start getting extremely mad and the
reason why he got mad because I learned
months later because I met the
organizator of the the good where the
game where I did the good 12K session
that's tell me oh I put threee rags in
this game and get destroyed but what's
the quity of PR Rex getting destroyed in
this live games where like everybody
Play 50 VPS zero basically so the game
was rigged I don't know how it was
ringing it and what was really funny is
the um the owner didn't know I took
action to his son so his son like
scammed me a little bit P paid after
like a a long time after um I know it
was quite funny I thought it was
impossible that he bring me into a game
if he lose actions and he paid me in a
in a in um
you know scaming game for me it was not
possible but I think it's actually the
the end of the stories he he didn't
understand that it was rigged so I get
like well [ __ ] for this so yeah the
first was like a little bit difficult I
would say uh I you were like okay this
life fker thing that sounds great let's
let's play more yeah I was I was a bit
naive you know and the last day um I
went to uh back to Manila and I met one
guy named uh okay I'll not say his name
and he borrowed me his apartment uh
because I was waiting to play very very
big game uh that I actually didn't play
was like uh very big like average TR was
like between 200k and two millions US
dollar uh but like I didn't play and
they were telling me okay we'll put you
on some 510 to to test you and stuff but
I think I understood that like there was
more like let's seeing me hope I would
play really big but was just to like
having a a horse I will explain I was
not going to have a horse like I I I was
playing I was playing 5K this time so
like why will play
1K 1K full time when the game is are not
even great anyway and so they like let
me in the bment and um I went to session
so that's after getting scammed okay I
come back to Manila and they say to me
okay let's let's try this 510 and I said
okay let's try for the first time but
again I'm not going to be a horse for
you
uh I sit on the game the game is 10% cap
five blinds and I saw like everybody
fall for like three all Bs tonight I
just I just leave because like you can't
even if it's not R you can't win
basically not enough FAL players and so
so I went back to the apartment at like
10: p.m. 11:00 p.m. I decided to fell
asleep um at like midnight I hear noises
in my apartment and I I don't know why I
say to myself let's open the door you
know sounds like a good idea I open the
door I see two two trainers guy I don't
even know who a ho in the apartment in
their kitchen so they door open right to
the kitchen and now like for like two
three seconds I was like to be sleepy I
didn't understand now after I realized
what's going to happen and start was
super stressed and uh what happened is
we I fixed the guy the guy fixed me but
it fixed me in a way like say like
didn't expect me to see um to see me you
know uh uh and so two or three seconds
after the sumers opened the door and it
was a guy that like rent me the
apartment and there was actually like
just doing some kitchen as just doing
some like some um just like went to the
supermarket and has had to like take one
uh one shisha as you said H and so when
I say that I was like but if I lose a
big session and the bigger gamees could
just come but without the shisha and
just just come like I don't know just
like take my money and stuff so I was
like okay I'm house so I left the
country and uh and it was really funny
because I have a message on telegram I
don't I can show you on on the screen
but like basically I say to him like uh
never going to come back you can't just
go to if the place is mine it's mine you
can't just go enter the place while I'm
sleeping you know and he said oh sorry
but we had to put things in the in the
fridge he literally save me this by Mage
with what them doing this game and uh I
mean he's know he he's nice we doing um
yeah and so um this the first thing I
first like live stuff I did I went to
like also many places but not like very
like big
experiences um because I was moving a
lot so I never like stayed um like two
or three months or for for game I played
the last year 51 20 in in France was it
went well and the I would say bigger
game I play was obviously to this here
in AIA can't say exactly where for
obvious reasons and I placed there where
I was partially backed so I had like a
percentage of my own action and I was
backed for um like most of the money I
put on the table and the stakes were in
go was
125 250 500 and we are playing with 100K
stacks and very short time it was uh 5
51,000 I only play 51,000 once but for
like even few ends because the VIP left
after and the way the games work are
like you have one VIP and all also guys
are Pros most people are backed and um
you just play for the VIP POS but the
problem is when I arrived he were
starting to get a little bit better and
at first he was losing uh 20 to 30
Millions per year US dollar and but he
started to lose like way less and become
way better and when I came he was
actually very tight and it was not the
guy thought it
was and So like um I started the the
session so I was there I was alone and
but I didn't really know my backers
obviously they really nice guy and
professionals but I didn't really know
them just send me a message on Discord
like you want to come say yeah why not
just took the flight few days after
let's to go for some Adventures you know
new AR and um first uh day I play and um
the VIP the way he walk was like when
you start there is a new player in the
game he wants to like impress a little
bit or like test you know and so the the
one of the first thing I played was uh
he opens withg I have a skin a freeat we
are playing uh around uh around like one
I play 100 deep um around that and he p
b JN like in two seconds and I knew like
he was doing this to newcomers then that
he will be a bit wider so I call with
wasting and uh I have like a single
Spade the B is like
um uh like five ju three U seven eight
whatever with three clubs on the Flop
four clubs on the river and so uh he he
say to me okay you win he like fake his
Mark and he returned h10 with enough
Club I didn't have any club the first I
lose and so at the first station I'm
down like 80k or something so I'm like
oh jeez it's not going to be good second
day um I bluffed way too much so like I
was not reallying myself well enough
just way too much and I done like
probably 80 or 90k so I was done in two
session like 100,000
7K so obv wish my backers were not
really happy especially because I was
Notting myself well enough but after he
Chang I walked a lot of like how
different profiles playing was the T
timing decisions and I just just like
started working toward the same people
over and over uh and uh and after it
went really well and um yeah I finished
at uh in this game uh
496 uh K us the law uh so obviously was
my first like six figure months uh for
for me not going to say how much I had
obviously um but yeah it was it was a
good experience um and um I I got
actually I got a good run and I played
also I think really well so um was a
good experience but was really difficult
again because as we discussed a little
bit balance is important and I did the
same mistake as in Philippines uh I just
I was just like alone and I I playing
for like 14 15 hours a day sometimes
even more um I even played for one day I
played uh uh I played the second day I
played uh I did the roll over like I
play for the full night and the day
after so I played for like
I think 32 33 hours
straight never doing this I will never
do this again it's just was terrible uh
yeah and um but I was quite alone there
not too many friends and obviously like
when I first came into the game people
knew who I was so was not happy that I
was into the game so most people were
not really nice but it was um I then was
kind of fun it went really well actually
so that's cool so if I understood it
correctly
these organizers of the game that put
you in the game they organize the game
for the VIP the VIP kind of
not he likes to play and you know people
organize the game around him um yeah
he's so in terms of in terms of stakes
uh any uh I remember you talked about uh
the sweaty hands on your mouse uh when
when you were uh uh making this training
recording any sweaty hands in this
session because I can imagine you know
if this if played under BS uh even even
if you know if you sell action you know
it's yeah it's a lot of money I mean I
still had a decent part of my action so
that as well yeah was higher than 5,000
andl but yeah oh yeah I got some I got
one po the third day so I was I was
losing and the way this type of
contracts works is you know you need to
stay until you you win basically if if I
simplify that um
and so I play a sport where I have ace
four Club itg open I for bet we play
nine MS the VIP call and the VIP was in
general tight but sometimes buzzing his
profile it's very very very difficult
obviously observe a lot directional
player very difficult to understand it's
very very random when he's doing it he's
calling the
button uh and the UT guy calls preway to
the Flop the ball is 1043
with one Club you check I decid to bet
big here uh the reason is because if I
bet bigger in this SP I represents way
more of person laser street so I'm going
to have more full Equity people not
going to raise me so I realize my equity
and I get get full directly by ends like
eight n and stuff anyway I have a big um
VP call and fall so stand for free um I
have H4 clap One Clap 30 is the eight of
clap okay uh we play we play very deep
with play um we play 200 230 dips or
something each uh I us to check I think
you can also play pressure whatever I
check check back turn is uh river is a
seven of Club so I have ace four of club
and Jack nine uh of club and seven um
and nine uh I mean there's two straight
flush in the in the ball b and I bet
around 65% I don't really like my I
think alot is a little bit better uh 40%
yeah I better around this and he tank
for like 5 minutes and he asked me to
show one C asked me to show one car you
really know what it means like whatever
and now he put his um this the best
sensation in the world when people have
a lot of ships have you know plaque I
don't know how to say it in English plet
it took his pet and he like puts it on
the table like this as he raised to 60k
and uh well I R four clubs so she really
happy I don't want to Stow it that much
so I JN and um he called quite fast so I
was like he's not going to have Jack KN
of clubs come on we're going to be down
like
300,000 and so he revealed he um when I
jump he called and he had the king king
three of club uh no he had King fire
Club so he he called with King fire on
the Flop and yeah one the spots was like
228k so like super massive obviously we
really happy like I did my first like
six figur session you know uh yeah and
after I left because I was was tired
that was funny what are like some
adjustments uh that you have to make
when you go from online game to a live
game and what do you think are like
common mistakes that online players make
when they go play live I think in a live
environment it's way more about players
against players so I will seek way more
for we I can have in specific guy and
absolutely not going to play at all uh
if I don't play against um I play uh you
had him in the podcast I play
kov and very nice guy by the way and uh
for example I we play a little bit more
balanced against him uh because I don't
want to startop explo to Wars with
players and players that like knows me
and that I know so I will really to will
really base my game on where I'm facing
okay I'm going to face someone and he
looks a little bit coing station as well
I'm probably going to BL specific spots
but not
uh that not too much actually uh let's
say I play this guy was a bit NY or
upload way more pressure and live games
um what's really important to understand
it's like way more player against
players but again the the game I play
was really different that most live
games and for example in these games are
less multi-weight Bots because it was
more like a pro game but if you go to um
let's say more like normal game uh
you're going to play multi B close to
all the time is the biggest difference
and it's so the game that is way more
based on the adaptation taking notes on
the players and doing very specific
exploit on the other guy and also you
have way more elements to take into
consideration you have sizing timing of
decision you have also Tails uh don't
overestimate life tail of course because
the techniques of uh life is way more
important than the the TS things
yeah you also mentioned that you're
dabbing around a little bit in uh in the
for Cart Street how's that been going
in the Ford card uh for card no liable
yeah so I I still learning it last year
uh and now I'm like learning it more and
more the main format I'm playing right
now but I'm playing in private games
online and yeah I actually really enjoy
it and I think for ice it's kind of the
future I don't want to be like top CR
battling and stuff just like it doesn't
um I'm interested into that I just want
to exploit tricks better and just like
make money out of this format so I'm not
playing very big now just play 1020
which actually big because you know it's
p but uh yeah just just want to train
stuff to get better and when I'm when
I'm better I'm just going to play way
higher uh yeah I think the game is uh
it's more fun uh I think there a very
big difference between p 4 and P 5 P 5
is it's about Casino you know uh but um
yeah it's um it's fun you know and as I
said it in earlier I think you need to I
personally needed to like develop
YouTube channel to coach do all the
stuff to stay focus in the poker
worldall because I can do like fully
poker every day full-time anymore so if
I do all the formats I know I will have
more interest will pick my interest game
again and uh yeah and so um this a great
game how do you see the future the
future of poke we already talked a
little bit about GG and know you're
mentioning you know you're you're
playing in like some nice private games
live online is that kind of the future
and how does one
become better at getting into private
games what what are like some dos and
don'ts okay so the first thing is about
the future uh for online I think it's
going to be that for Icees I'm talking
and that's also why I did the transition
obviously I I got some like insights on
like what can what could happen on GG I
was not sure about just like meet one
one guy from the team talk me about that
but I didn't think it was going to be
like that fast in term of change and I
didn't thought it was going to be this
well tell me it will be like um a little
maybe they thought about doing something
like a little B little bit more like on
the like life scene it's actually what I
means was doing more like private games
and the problem is if I to private games
is like you can't make a living in 5K
plus anymore it's not like huge mistakes
because you can still win a lot in 100
now
but I think the way onlines need to
evolve for players they need to like
seek more for good games can be like
private games can be clubs obviously a
lot of clubs are riged so you need to be
careful uh or other sites and just like
choose more what's the best play to
what's the best place to play because we
can talk about everything for the
learning process Etc if you play only
with fishes uh and you don't work on
your game you're going to win more than
the r that is the best of the side
so you need to select better the games
you play focus on the EV and this is how
the think the game will Street a little
bit obviously you can still win on
normal sides but if you want to like
play more table and win more the game
it's going to be better to get change
size like for example actually G is like
it's not really a good size to stay
polite and the poies now is in Crazy
direct and I remember when I was playing
them like two years ago five of 1K the
wreck was five now it's eight so like it
it's really decreas the age you have and
you win less and less so it's better to
like six fors of games I say all live
games yeah so that's probably indeed
what people are going to do right
they're gonna find try to find clubs
again the apps are going to be booming
again they're going to try to find you
know they're going to go to this place
in Asia and play uh play play with this
guy who drops 20 20 30 million you know
they're going to go in the private game
scene or like some red flags when it
comes down to you already said you know
you have to be careful with the clubs
you have your experience in life like
some red flags for the people out there
you know now going to try to find clubs
try to get into private G I know every I
know every clubs so obviously it's way
easier for me to know what's rig what's
not uh in club GG and poke Bros Etc they
had like some they like some bot that
are we cing system that like can I now
easy to detect because like the company
that sells it is nothing really into the
Poke world so if you see a club with
like few limits available and says there
is like 1K 400 NL 600 NL and you don't
see one single player at the free table
like multi tabling just Bots are clean
uh if is your players playing for like
600 ends at the same time for 10 hours
straight High chance it's a bot and uh
so you need to have like a trustful
agent I would say just for people for
like the the fun exchange and you also
need to like know the U imacy of the
clubs um I only play on Club GG I either
play Private clubs or public but only
very very few public uh clubs you can
play on uh so just I will ask I will
advise people to ask people that like
have experience to these Club even if
they want to ask music can uh to really
not lose and get rigged because getting
rigged could uh cost way more than
playing to good games uh and for the
last games the red flag something I you
like to do I'll say it even on the
podcast to know if the game is not
rigged or rigged I will always ask the
guy to stuck me 100% so I will say to
him I'll find an excuse I will say I'm
broke whatever even the game is 2kl I
will say I want to be stucked at 4%
because my money is elsewhere and if the
guy is saying yes it's a massive green
flag because it means you agree that I'm
not bringing liquidity to his game and
so the probity of this game to be rigged
is way lower obviously get like lose and
after he can ask me the money fren me
can happen but the the risk is way lower
and way lower and I received also with
the the Instagram growth I had she a lot
of for per on live games and sometimes I
say to people yeah I can come but you
stack me Oris oh no response let say the
game was rigged you know but if the game
is so good that you want me to be him uh
why do you don't stack me instead of
like taking me a few actions and that's
uh I think really good thing people can
ask is like and asking the all to stack
them and start to be stacked again like
if the guy is saying yes after say oh no
actually it's okay I'll play my own
money is that that like if the owner
accepts that um we can bring a liquidity
um you don't bring liquidity to the game
like it lower chance I would take and
and for the question how to get invited
to credit games um I think you need
to like in relation like what what do
you bring on the table what I'm useful
for so the goal is not to be like to
fake fun with like VPS and stuff like
just be yourself be kinding to people
and and um just being interested to
people for example if I play a table the
vp's billionaire obviously it's
interesting you know like how he
achieved this what's the what's the
problem he has on the day because it's a
it's complete different world war the
guy life is different and if you like
interested to the guy don't take it for
a [ __ ] and just respect the players
obviously you have way more chance to be
invited like
be invited again uh the second thing is
obviously asking I think not enough
people ask just ask people let's say uh
you see a guy losing a lot at your
casinos just ask this he play some
private games and can you be invited
into these games and sometimes people
underestimate what they can have is to
just ask and a lot of people ask me how
can I get to PR games you didn't even
ask as maybe you can come Point actually
yeah I think we automatically assume
like yeah well I'm not welcome uh yeah
and the V don't ask I mean for the owner
you're still one guy that can ra you
know so especially for live games where
like the game enironment still need
people to rre like if he has three or
four weaker players he will still need
people that that RS obviously it's
better to have R players because the
extration of liquidity will be less
important but you know you can still be
useful in a sense and also um I think in
the way you play just like be just just
show your cards when they want uh do big
Bluffs just be funny to play with
actually and it's important to sacrifice
some e let's and do
like sometimes very aggressive move or
like just play the senges like like you
did in the video like just play the SES
for yourself you know and you just say
to people I play seven use and you
really play seven ju and so uh and you
can even actually win money from this in
live games if you see you too aggressive
and you actually never BL the you
whatever uh but it's very important to
change the way you play and just just be
just be real with people like uh like
faking a behavior is not working and
it's not it's not good like I don't want
to see myself as um like when I'm faking
a behavior with a VIP um I'm feeling a
little bit like
U I don't have the right wall I want to
say w but it's not the world but like I
I feel it not myself see what I mean I
don't I don't like it and the guy will
feel it anyway yeah yeah when it's not
uh when it's not authentic I I will
actually add I will add one from my own
experience experience uh last time last
time I was in Vegas I randomly got
invited to a private game as well uh
don't piss off the the owner of the game
that's that's going to be my ADV I
didn't know who hosted the game man like
and I st the guy twice and apparently
was pissed and I had to stand up and
leave basically while I was I actually
you know I was super active and there
were two guys that were [ __ ] short
teing and they literally one guy one guy
he showed three times he showed his hand
three times he showed bces get this
[ __ ] guy out of your game and I was
in there every every every hand you know
but I happened to own I happened to own
the owner of the game and I didn't know
he was the owner of the game so then I
got a message from the guy who invited
me he said yeah yeah when uh when this
round of standup game ends I'm sorry I
have to leave so yeah it was was short
short fun uh I was a bit tilted because
because seriously man there were two or
three guys that were like get get these
guys out of the game they were so
annoying the guy even slower me with
with Aces [ __ ] uh yeah I was a
bit pissed
like with the sorry no definitely make
like be nice with the O is a really good
advice I mean wasn't like I was not nice
I was just chatting with him and but he
was just apparently uh he was just a guy
who tilts qu fast and you know he lost
two times he lost his stack against me
uh and actually okay that that was
actually one guy he understood this was
actually guy who invited me to the game
he understood the politics man he
literally so the owner of the game game
so I tack him he got tilted he just
starts open jaming 10K okay guy someone
opens so he's on my direct left I ising
suited obviously I flat because he's
been jamming T then he gets angry he
said what do you think I'm dumb so he
didn't FS because he got angry that I
trapped him when when the hand I the
hand hand ended up going open I saw this
King and he got angry at me for trapping
him you know and then actually the oh
the guy who invited me he he folded T
because he didn't want to be uh the guy
that the the guy that he would lose
money to that's that's like some Next
Level understanding like the dynamic of
of of the game right he was like go yeah
I I don't I I want to be out of your way
you're clearly steaming right now he
open jamming 10K uh I'm not gonna be uh
the wo who's trapping him with Ace King
because then I kicked out of the game
pretty smart move holding uh he just he
just folded t
pretty sick maybe I will get invited for
for GG games just like I don't I don't
know how it works you just send a
message and if you're down so far from
what I understood you send a message and
if you're down uh then they will accept
you until uh elki sees that you're a pro
hey that's Joe viral from uh from from
this YouTube channel get him out of this
game it's uh I think so far how it works
but obviously you know it's quite a new
change we don't really have enough
information yet I want to quickly dive
into you you do a lot you make content
you make content on YouTube Instagram
you also do coaching uh coach for GTO
wizard shout out GTO wizard guys uh yeah
I'm more I'm wondering in your
experience working with player what are
what are like the most common leaks uh
that you see in your coaching
experience
um for light games online games both we
could talk both okay people don't think
enough about what they do so like hands
ask me okay what do you do but it's like
uh let's say I don't know how to say
something in English and I put the
sentence tradiction and not even looking
the sentence or just barely looking at
they really think about oh how do we say
that or how can I say that for example
like you will improve but in in poker is
the same like uh too many players just
like waiting for someone to answer the
questions whereas sometimes they can
just answer the question by themselves
of this in a way that like will make
them improve on the long run uh that's
the first thing I think the second thing
is uh too much like specific technical
links licks that are linked to specific
way of thinking so let's say uh I am
with a guy um and he uh tells me oh I
need to play uh this way my value and my
bluff and I asked him why why can't you
play your value in this size and you
Bluff in the size what's the problem
with that and um a lot of especially for
live games have like this like ter leak
where they think that like okay but if
they do this this way then it's uh it's
not um uh it's not the the the way to do
it like is I need to play it everywhere
it's actually not the case um yep and
for more online I think just not paying
attention enough to details so it can be
timing or just like the sizing people do
sometimes people to do free quarter but
it's not really free quarter it's 82%
because it just size up because they
want more money you know and you can
just for and do
this type of things yeah and also like
not having like a precise path of
learning um and obviously for live
people it's a bit more difficult that's
also why I like did the the the
monitoring and the cor for for light
games um but yeah just like follow
follow something follow guad line um
even if it's not the the perfect one
when you say like not a clear path of
learning do they like lack sort of a
study plan and how would you recommend
people to study and improve the game
obviously you know people should go to
GTO wizard we've we've already
established GTO wizard yes um I think
could you maybe recommend like a study
plan for our audience that's basically
what I'm
saying um it really depends on the leak
offs of each person so like saying
something optimal for everybody is not
possible but if I have to do my best
I would say um always try to look at so
train in the digal results see where you
do the most mistakes and train only like
spots that happen the most like single
race spots M against big line fre SPS
Etc in in online games see where you are
doing mistakes uh understand why you do
these
mistakes and um if you if you face
something you don't know um or like you
can learn from or you do you did
mistakes just put them into the into
notes review them after the session of
training you did put them into the map
and just do it over and over again and
have the same mind m fold no short
taking that's V your result also you can
like I think and reviews with like
people that are better than you is
probably the best uh construct your
thinking first and see what the other
guy is doing and it can be okay I watch
a video I say I watch one of your live
PL from YouTube channel I watch it and I
will ask myself before okay what what do
I do in his shoes and uh it's it's a
good way to learn because like obviously
if I'm I'm like playing lower STS uh I
will learn a lot from new videos so it's
great to uh think myself what I'm going
to do because in average you're gonna
play better like 95% of the time even
more um and so doing this is great
because it helps you having the ab of
constructing your thinking process first
okay and after seeing what's the guy is
doing and so you have these direct uh
answers basically and it's also unbiased
because it's easy to to hear me or you
for example say something that oh yeah
yeah sure yeah that makes sense where
would you would you have thought about
that as well actually something I wanted
to add when you talked about the
coaching and you ask okay what would you
do and this is kind of what we talked
about earlier like when you have a coach
try to really ask like okay how did you
come to that conclusion or what type of
variables did you take in consideration
why did you make this play you
understand try to understand like okay
what is what is it his thought process
and what can I learn from how he got to
his decision instead of just asking him
the answer right also in your
observation what sets
students uh apart from the ones that
succeed compared to the ones that
fil why do people I how deep they think
in the
play like uh I have my life course I
took 10 person uh in September uh and so
they have like access to one to one
calls with me and the one who perform
the best is the one who thinks the most
about the hands he play always like if I
if I have a session with a guy and he
send me a hand he really thinks about it
um he tells me oh I think we can play
this way or this way Etc I knew he will
like uh improve the most and also be
because he's open he's open Curious yeah
he's open Curious and he thinks about
what he he does so if he thinks about
what he does every every single time he
build uh LS he really like neural LS to
just thinks faster and better to what
he's doing so he's going to take better
decision on the long run is the guy just
like playing a hand but you know he not
really thinking deeply about it um just
like um oh my hand has to play his way
and just play too Sly what prevents
people from thinking deeply do you think
um being lazy I think lazy not not lazy
as a w but like lazy in the thinging
process because it's an effort to think
you know between like uh like you can be
on Wizard just check the solution or
like understand like what you need to do
before watching the solution and the
difference between the two is just just
the of doing it yeah again like if if
you see the solution you look at it then
again you would say oh yeah that makes
sense
but if you try if you try before you
open it try to think okay I think this
is going to happen let's see it's it's
laziness but the the main thing is
actually because people don't have the
abits you know they never develop the
abits of deeply thinking into a hand so
if they don't have the abits Z they are
going to post one hand it's going to be
the same but if even if they want to
learn because they don't have this U
habit of thinking deeply about what to
do like um they're going to do this
mistake what do you think is uh overall
I think you already uh talked a little
bit about good advice what do you think
is overall bad advice or the worst
advice that you've been given in
[Music]
poker I think it's the two WS you need
you know you need to call you need to do
this you I don't need to do anything if
you have S N want to fall I fall if I
think is the best move and the most
conservative move yeah so you don't need
to do anything uh you can do anything
you want but you don't have any
obligation of like calling these folding
these and uh too many players the
mistakes of oh I I can fold this yeah
you can fold this if you want to lose
money but like
um just just like play the the way you
think is the best
always yeah that's that the worst thing
I would say yeah you need it definit is
also definitely a closer if we talk
about curiosity creativity
actually I made a video the other day
five bad habits T has t you that one was
in there as well way too much thinking
about I have to instead of can I can I
that that that is interesting can I can
I make this fer can I make this Co
because if you ask can I make this CER
you think like what can I make this C
well let let me think what is he
bluffing with oh wait there's not a lot
of
BL maybe I cannot go here it's but like
we laugh about it right now but but like
the questions that you ask yourself if
you ask yourself do I need to call this
your brain is going to go to the solver
output that you memorize with all the
great techniques that yolan has taught
us today you know it goes there and he's
like yes it's a call and you press call
but if you ask can I call then you're
giving your brain a completely different
question and then your brain says okay
well let me figure this out can I call
and then you will come to a completely
different conclusion so yeah great take
times when you when you play yeah that
will be the the best advice like
like 10 seconds minimum per streets
where like there's some decision to do
obviously if you jack 5G like just four
but let's say you on the river like I
will take at least 30 seconds in all
River
spots Adam Adam I'm uh uh um I'm
curious what kind of impact do you think
these questions or these these Conant
things that we uh kind of Raven herself
this decision making process what kind
of consequences does it have to our
decisions yeah well as you guys have
touched on there the power of the
questions you ask lead to the quality of
your decisions so if you're sloppy with
your questioning or you brush over it
you're going to get sloppy answers yeah
I think it's was very interesting as you
said there yolan that the best players
think more and it's such a simple thing
but it's like okay why don't people
think more as he mentioned again it was
like because it costs energy it's
draining it's tiring I think if you got
curi osity curiosity is like free energy
it's like free energy oh this is awesome
whereas when you haven't got curiosity
you're like got to think about this and
also humans we like shortcuts we like
going give me the simplified version so
I can understand so yeah I think as
you're touch on there like the
importance of asking questions I think
as you were talking about organizing
information in the conversation you were
going through a set of questions to ask
yourself so yeah I think there's no real
substitute four good questions if you
haven't got those the mind's the mind is
actually very amazing it finally answers
the good questions so if you give the
mind a question the Mind goes to work to
answer that question if you don't give
it a question or you give it a bad
question the mind will also either fill
in the blank or answer the bad questions
it's like how do I give my mind good
questions what are some good questions
for this situation that's a very good
starting point to ask yourself because
sometimes were like okay well I would
ask myself good questions but if you
break down a situation what be some good
questions and start of come with those I
think is very important then you
mentioned as well making it habitual you
want to make it the habit of going a bit
deeper the habit of asking a certain
question until it gets ingrained any
Habit to begin with takes time it takes
um almost overcome resistance of the old
habits to form the new but once you form
it then all of a sudden it creates
momentum and it gets in GRE so yeah so
many things to dive into there but I
want to be respectful of your time
youran I about a few like kind of
signature questions and reflection stuff
so we'll go into those now so first of
all I want back on your PO career and
kind of think of some lessons you've
learned so you came in from a few
different angles obviously you overlap
with the memory stuff that we've T about
but what do you think is the most
important lesson that you've learned on
your poker
[Music]
journey I think you need to enjoy what
you do you need to enjoy the
process you need not to put too much
pressure on yourself and um don't think
that like sacrifices will make you a
better
person the free main thing
take what would you say to players who
maybe have straight up that path and
they're in sacrifice mode but they
haven't really got the success in the
short term so it feels like they can't
ease off I've always found myself like
when I get to a certain level of stuff
or a c amount of success it's like oh
yeah of course balance makes a lot of
sense now but when you're on the journey
to kind of grind to a result sometimes
you struggle to see that perspective so
what would you say to players who are in
Tren is right now the definition they
have for sacrifice is um like prioritize
things that are less important um
so let's say I have like my top three
elf relationship uh poker but what I did
was like I um put poker way way over the
2001 uh and this is not what I should do
uh and but when I say sacrifice doesn't
mean you do not going to put time in
poker obviously need to put a lot of
time an effort into the game it's it's
important um but um yeah just uh it's
important to put the but at the same
times value also the two other important
things one that's the main thing I'm
saying yeah but obviously you need
dedication you need you need to put a
lot of times I watched over thousand
videos I don't know how many ends I
reviewed uh and but this was part of the
process and I enjoyed doing it and
enjoyed putting effort into it and
that's the that's the most important
yeah yeah it's almost like don't make
the wrong sacrifices don't sacrifice the
things that are more important the thing
that's maybe less important even though
it feels like it so generally Health
relationships are going to go above um
kind of Financial and achievement goals
and if they're out of alignments I think
in the short term it doesn't really
matter like I always feel like a week of
hardc coreness a month of just crushing
stuff and not prioritizing your health
and stuff is fine in small Seasons it's
like as you mentioned like understand
the bigger picture like you always
reflect every single day to go hm I'm I
getting out of line here I'm out of
balance in terms of what I should be
prioritizing if that goes on too long
that's when you need to to get Back in
Balance all right I want to know in
terms of any um any false assumptions
that you had coming into poker that be
about poker or what it success would
look like that turned out to be
wrong uh yeah I felt like I do poker all
my life like playing poker all my life
obviously you know it's the beginning so
it's kind of like a relationship with a
person you know you fall in love with
the game so you fall in love with a
person like going to stay 30 years you
know no it's not going to happen
um and
um yeah uh what else
um yeah I felt
um
um I thought like uh I could succeed
alone but as we discussed at the
beginning you know
Cally and um I just felt that the that
when I will be ice sexual I'll not do
anything else in my life and I I
understood that now my happiness is
coming more from like being more balanc
obviously now I play way less and I mean
with the 5K being that I canot even play
that much online so I play way way less
these days and it's fine and just um
it's okay not to because when I started
po I wanted to be the the best in the
world and now I'm not considering myself
the best in the world in the like U game
uh like playing game of respect um and
and it's okay just accepting that
sometimes you don't succeed in your goal
and the goals are here to make you a
better person so not be they not here to
be achieved they achieved super uh but
yeah and understand that you can change
things you want and it's it's okay and
sometimes you even for someone let's say
someone's want to be Pro or someone to
be really want to be in poer and it's
very attached to this but yes sometimes
the
the best moment is to leave and if I
didn't succeed in poker and I was I
don't know I trained for like four or
five years really at my maximum capacity
without any result yeah probably um
probably believe if if I'm really at
maximum and I really want to be the best
and it just it's okay to have different
goals sometimes and different um uh
different things we want to
do it goes back to the advice you I
think a coach give you to say if you try
all out and fail it's fine
full effort and yeah interesting as you
mentioned you initially had the goal to
be the best in the world of poer and as
you've evolved that goals maybe changed
a bit how has your definition of success
changed and the way you align goals
how's that changed for your
success um well obviously I talk a lot
about saice the way I um I heard I um
learned the game was through like um you
know I didn't I didn't win for two years
I put a lot of our into it's was kind of
through pain actually and so right now I
want to deviate a little bit more about
oh okay if I'm if I'm balance you know
if I have a um for person in my life or
if if I have good relation with my
friends and with my families uh I know
that um it
will help me to get closer to the
success because I'm not going to have
this parasite faults of like oh I need
to get a girlfriend like oh I I'm lo my
life full of moments or like whole my
relationship not great so like I need to
improve my health I don't want these
vots so if I don't have these vots uh
because like everything is on the roads
I would say I will have all the time and
and Effectiveness to to achieve my my my
um my goals and then be P
about it's almost like getting that
alignment and getting everything ins syn
I think often we waste a lot of time
from the things we could be doing and
there's kind of conflict in thoughts
often like deviates or attention and
energy so yeah sounds like getting that
kind of that Clarity of what you want to
achieve and get everything kind of
streamlined in the right direction so
you're not like in conflict with
yourself and I think it's it's important
to be kind with yourself it's what my M
coach told me is like I did this
mistakes but back in the days I thought
was the best to do I maybe actually it
was the best to do and I say don't do
sacrif fire but if I would not do this
you know if I wouldn't have done this I
will not be there but um I think it's
it's important to be kind of yourself
with the mistakes you are doing the the
bigger mistakes you do the smaller
mistakes you do just like remember we're
hum and that's it's just normal not to
be perfect and I got also this problem
with the like I wanted everything to be
perfect so the studies even sometimes
the videos like people ask me why don't
you publish more videos but sometimes
because I really want the subtitles The
Cut Etc has to be perfect but I you have
like 30 rush I can do uh so yeah just um
understand of like I'm never going to be
perfect anyway and for all the like
project I have just um um it can be like
I six Boker for live games I still want
to invest a lot of time into to playing
life Booker or it can be um can be
anything else just um just like enjoy
the process and understand things can
take
times yeah self-compassion I think goes
into that like kind of being kind to
yourself um and it kind of goes on the
end of it's the middle point of two
spectrums where it's you're too hard on
yourself and you're the workaholic who
just beats himself and always maybe a
perfectionist wants everything right
then you got the person who doesn't
really care too much like really easy on
themsel like yeah it's no big deal and
the self-compassion like is in the
Middle where you're like you're realist
you understand that okay like made
mistakes you accept them but you're also
kind to yourself and you you're nice to
yourself in those ways I think it's
really hard to strike that balance
because most people go too far one way
too far the other and I think he's
trying to find for yourself if you're a
perfectionist and you're going to be
overly Harding yourself and learning
more self-compassion being kind to
yourself accepting of your frailties
often will get you back closer to that
kind of that optimal point now there a
lot of people listen to this who are
very curious about my memory right now
and going right I want actually work on
my memory and it's going to take people
in very various directions on YouTube
and chat jbt to find out some directions
so as a poker player based on what
you've learned what do you feel like are
some importance maybe mindsets skills so
memory skills or memory techniques that
will be use of a PO players to start
working on um it's very difficult to say
to someone like okay you you will do
this and you will improve your memory
because I know sometimes it's not doable
and I C some professional poker players
to improve the memory and Andre also did
it my friend was a world memory Champion
for for four years and the thing is it
takes so much time but sometimes not
worth it because it's better to work on
the things that directly
uh that you can see directly on your
screen for poker so I recommend like a
2080 approach where like you work on the
20% will bring 80% of results and for
that um I will um I will um advise
people to uh first as just said
organized okay prioritize simplify and
just put it into a map and if they do
this consistently and again it's very
simple it's only four steps you're going
to like have way better results than
other people simply because the
formation retention be higher and yes
obviously the best out will be to go to
Wy and do it every day Etc this is the
best but if you have all the information
you learn into one or two or three
different mind map and everything is
centered you're going to improve the way
you memorize things way better and
there's no like very you know insane
technique Etc obviously there are some
techniques I use but I know that like
for poker players uh it will take too
much time to implement for it to be wor
if he doesn't have the interest that I
had for memory just as a skill and as a
fun thing to
do yeah that's awesome yeah I think
that's it comes down to understanding
how we learn and what is actually useful
for all of us and as you mentioned I can
organizing prioritizing simplifying and
creating a visual regardless of what
you're trying to learn that kind of
works very well for our brains to be
able to retain information learn well
obviously techniques on top that you
might want to add if it's that your
interest but I think it's really good to
know what actually can we all be doing
more of myself from this conversation
I'm like I read a lot of books but I
sometimes don't simplify them at the end
I sometimes don't write the bullet
points that I've learned from that book
got loads and notes I'm like will I
actually learn those things or should I
just condense it to a simpler so I can
actually uh learn that going forward
also creating visuals I'm a very visual
learner but sometimes I don't create
visual mind maps of the the knowledge
I've learned so it just slips by and it
goes out my mind so it's good to re Rec
kind of remember this kind of stuff but
uh to actually take action and create
some kind of systems for information
which I think is very useful all right
looking back on your PO career which
part of your Pok career was most
enjoyable for you and why do you think
that was the
case I it was definitely start like when
I was stuck and I start winning money
because uh it was really the the moment
where I got the um the results of the
work I did and so I you see your all
like growing way way more than like
after obviously in ter of percentage was
clear the the best moment I really love
poer I was waking super early to play
play through the all day and it was not
even feeling sacrifice we just I just
wanted to play all the time um and I
think this was clearly the best best one
of the best moment and
um I started playing live like in
Switzerland so it was was nice uh yeah
but definitely this this this moment
like when when you first start to see
the RS coming uh it's the the most fun
bot say also the the 5K in was was
always kind of nice especially when I
started in the game like
20122 I was like 21 or something so yeah
and it was a good thing to because I
always wanted to be like the youngest TX
T player Po in the world like always had
this go so and um yeah was was fun to do
him yeah I think there's any it drive to
uh have growth of progress in what we do
and we work hard at something at some
point we want to see the reward for that
it's like ah all the way I put in it was
worth something it was worth the end
points and if you're currently haven't
seen the results it's like just keep
holding on to the if I keep doing the
work at some point I will get the the
end result I want and that will be worth
it I think that's I know myself I always
need some form of making progress in
what I'm doing to make what I'm doing
feel worthwhile but also enjoyable so
yeah I could definitely relate to that
one you've recently transitioned into
like business and doing more content and
coaching what would you say is a poker
skill that you found most useful to help
you transition from poker to business
overall oh decision decision process by
far or just having like a more clear
decision process um like assessing um if
these two scenarios that are the most
probable um like taking into account uh
benefits uh Advantage like like we have
like P as a poker player huge ad AG or
to other players because we took so much
decisions that even if decision were
different we are actually um able to
make them way faster in in real life and
that's clearly the the most important
thing for me nice are there any
resources or books that you've read on
your journey that have helped you to uh
create a better I wrote a book uh help
me a lot in my montal games book by
Peter Clark don't pet Peter Peter Peter
I think I don't uh I don't remember the
name of I think yeah it was poker
therapy or something yeah it really
helped me a lot because um I always got
this leak sometimes of like oh I'm I'm
going to get exploited so I need to like
do this and it cost me a lot of EBS and
this book helped me to understand what
was my leak and how to fix it and uh
yeah sorry shout out to Peter because
she's doing an amazing work for that um
and uh yeah this in term of books and in
term of uh
content
um I don't think I have like someone
precise jman helped me a little bit um I
I was watching uh Rene you were doing
videos in 2020 right yes yeah I watching
you a little bit also um some some
French players like chest but not very
known I think um in the English worlds
uh yeah I some YouTube channel
differently but not like
one bigger than the others I would
say yeah good stuff there's a book I
read recently called clear Thinking by
Shane Parish that's also very good for
going through decision-making processes
and how to Think Through complicated
decisions which aren't always easy like
life choices what is the EV of me going
down this path in my life choosing this
Avenue becoming a poker player over
starting a different job and really
thinking through process of how to how
to make a decisions because it's all and
good for us to be say okay how do you
let's make a decisions let's think more
but we also need we need a framework for
that we need to learn Frameworks or
develop them over time which you've
obviously done a great job of all right
I want to end this conversation with
asking you what would you like the main
takeaway for the audience to take away
from today's
conversation
um I would say be genuinely interested
to Poker what you learn um try to always
think about um what's the best action in
poker in life uh enjoy what you're doing
and um just get help with other to to
improve in each each aspect and also
just remember like poker and
professional life is just like just a
life among the all of the life you can
live I mean all the aspects of your life
basically and uh that it's um it's
important but all the other aspects are
also important I would say
there's a bigger Game of Life going on
which includes exactly the whole thing
yeah all right well thank you so much
for your time it's been a great
conversation and yeah we'll keep in
touch yeah thanks you too guys thank you
yolan for coming on the pot sharing this
wisdom with us and our listeners Adam
any main
takeaways well based on today's
conversation I need to organize my notes
and simplify H but I'll do my best in
this moment and one thing that came out
a lot was enjoyment and curiosity but
you're learning and how yes you can have
all these memory techniques but if
you're not curious and yeah enjoy what
you're doing you're always going to uh
underperform or not put the effort in
needed to get to the the long-term goals
so really tapping into that Curiosity
and finding ways to H be learning from
space of wanted to learn which then goes
into his next one which like kind of
going deep asking yourself why is this
happening he mentioned lots of different
contexts from a mindset perspective he
was looking at losing and making
mistakes and then ask himself what could
I do differently here what am I missing
always like that that layer of depth
different and he's he mentioned like the
best students of his are the ones who
think more and that sounds like a very
easy thing to achieve but thinking more
requires going deeper asking questions
and yeah kind of solidifying your
knowledge he did talk a lot about
questions that we ask ourselves and
having a good thought process in terms
of organizing your thoughts or in terms
of me remembering stuff I've wrote down
organize your thoughts simplify your
thoughts um associate with stuff so
create some sort of association with
things that you're learning and then
create some sort of visual represent you
mentioned how we can remember I think
150 words I think this is the world
record 150 words but 600 images so
that's like a massive discrepancy in
terms of how our minds are wired towards
the visual so trying to tap into that
leverage that I think is a very
important one he talk lot about not
sacrific him too much I think the the
key lesson here was don't sacrifice the
most important things which were Health
relationships yeah so many things could
dive into here but yeah I'll leave it at
that for now how about yourself or Ren
what's the most important lessons you
learned
um yeah I mean my memory is letting me
down here after a three-hour
conversation which actually Taps into
the first point respect the limitations
of the brain right it wasn't all about
turning your brain into this superc
computer no it was actually respecting
its limitations and it was more brain
hacking than necessarily brain in
performance enhancing right he for
example mentioned in solvers and in
general when you study things try to
really prioritize okay what's the most
important thing and forget about the
rest he talked about don't try to
memorize if something was done with a
30% frequency it's like remember the
things that we're always doing something
never doing something and the rest
somewhere in the middle right give it
50/50 he said don't don't put anything
more into it we talked a lot about
asking good questions right and there
was a bunch of questions what does your
hand here want to do he kept on coming
back to uh uh what is V what's my
opponent's range we can de to he he
mentioned the one that I always use
where should my value come from and it
come back to uh thinking something that
you also pointed out and gathering
information right he was really a a
puzzle solver and we talked a a lot
about Theory MDA said yeah you know it
it can all add but we should never stop
thinking in game gather information
about this range I really liked also
what he actually talked about uh coolers
it's very easy to when you have a set or
gave the example when you have Kings you
know the guy say it's cooler and just
not think about it but is it really
cooler you know and then he came for the
people maybe also listen back he he made
it quite quite quite a long ramble uh
but he talked a lot about the EV
discrepancy and basically what it came
down to is how I would simplify that for
myself what is the best scenario what's
my EV in the best case scenario what's
my EV in the worst case scenario and you
will see that in a lot of situations in
best case scenario you know you're
trying to find enough combos to make
your call Break Even SL slightly winning
but in worst case scen scario he's just
massively under bloing and you're losing
a lot of money so basically if one out
of 10 guys you know you lose 10bb which
your call and the rest you win 0.5 well
then you still cannot call that's
basically what he said because then on
average you will lose five big blinds
now you can make the call vers those
guys and really filter out that one guy
I usually like to say that the skill in
poker is being able to dodge bullets so
who's like the big knit in the game and
not pay that guy off this very important
um he also talked a lot about smart work
not necessarily hard work uh uh get
coaching study high spots right make
good notes of that all stuff that he
talked about and a very important one
not thinking about have to right I think
that's what he said worst advice giving
uh or worst habit that players have when
they think about have to I have to do
all these things he said no you don't
have to do anything and then we change
it to can I which is a way more Curious
question in general we talked a little
bit about the questions that you ask
yourself well can I actually call her
can I actually fold here and that will
steer you in a completely different
direction it comes back to the asking
good questions and when you didn't go
can there was another thing that he kept
on coming back to take your time take
your time I think he said that he took
30 seconds for every river decision so
yeah I mean I wrote down a bunch more
stuff but you know let's wrap it up uh
probably already too much too much main
takeaways for uh for what the set our
brain can handle so I want to thank
everyone for tuning in want to thank
Adam want to thank our sponsor GTO I
