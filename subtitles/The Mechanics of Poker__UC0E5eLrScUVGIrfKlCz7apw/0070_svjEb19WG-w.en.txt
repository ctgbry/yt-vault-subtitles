a long awaited twitch session
for a lot of people wanted to see us
play again
everything is resolved confirmed i'm not
a bot so
we're back in the streets if you see me
do my three at the table
go sit on his left that's my uh that's
my strategy
what else we got in the house we got el
poncho's law in the house roar in the
house price winning
actually i don't know price winning
aurora played a lot with over the years
up punches as well prize winning
i have no clue from slovenia
yeah took a little break went for a week
to portugal to visit
the legend scarface.vlt and we faced a
little three bet with the pocketknights
now we're gonna see a flop
i always have to get used again if you
haven't played for one half week who
feels me
it's like you don't even remember the
rules anymore i think nine sexy is a
fold here and let me see
maybe just a call but it's closed eight
seven six as i would definitely fault
and here queen jack i'm going to call
and going to call the turn
here the board paris which is
interesting
he goes for another block which i like
and i think
we have another call
but it's quite dicey here i'm gonna
check back the queen jack
okay checks
it's probably the point where we're
going to be betting right
and the same here with the queen jack
i'll bet the river
and he calls with ace queen so he stick
me in nicely there
slip me in nicely now we're gonna open
it up
and he threw that's bad timing my friend
very bad
i'm timing to make a little form
it was the ascent so he checked the turn
actually i think he could definitely bet
and you check out the river i think
check our river is fine here we flop
the nizzles and i
think i'm just gonna go for a ten
percent
even though sometimes with the nizzles
you know chicky chicky
you know i'm film with chucky chucky
when we have a very strong hand but
decided not to i think i can just range
back this board so
that's what i'll start doing he races
okay bet timing my friend
this is very bad timing very bad timing
but you know recall and i go checking
it and i think we're never going to bet
as obviously we are blocking
his main value range so i think the only
way to get value from this hand is hope
that he bloss or hope that he has a
worse hand
and he chases you with aces bad timing
my friend
very bad timing sick bluff though hey
shout out to him guys
definitely not a chicken stop for him
but you know we got aces
we got bucket aces
so we're falling straight with our nose
in the action
as we say in holland yes
let's go after nitu matri we're a little
bit deeper so
not gonna through that too much but hey
you know let's see the days
i'm always down with the suit of days
if it's suited you gotta play it you
gotta play it
dude where's all my clips ah here's the
clip that i wanted to play
feel the power you feel my power baby
feel my power you're my power here bomb
seven deuce
let's pump it up guys with the seven
deuce
never mind never mind never mind got
three bet oh my god
i can respect that i can respect the
yolos
i can definitely respect the others i'm
gonna check
call here with the queen i actually
gonna make a little donkey donkey donkey
on the stern i think
it's maybe a little bit uh
unconversional is that a word
i don't know i'm not that good in uh
in a very expensive language okay i'll
leave that up to
other people i'm recognizing that that's
an advantageous card for his float range
and then setting up a check raised
induction just allows him to
pull the trigger with the bottom of his
range okay guys are a little crazy crazy
interesting
interesting we don't have a heart that's
usually good
our boat is not that light actually i
think i'm going to make a little nitty
fold
little chicken song to myself why not
[Applause]
[Music]
i'm gonna make some bitter butter for
the first time tonight
are they any good listen
not really a big fan of bitter palate to
be honest but you know
you know you know
called it over the a street not going to
make a donkey dunk i thought about it
but decided not to
just gonna go for the check raise the
check the check raise
which he didn't allow me to do
unfortunately
he's gonna bet the turn
he surrendered london tries to surrender
versus bill perkins
but to be fair you know if suddenly bill
perkins throws out a lot of uh
you know stuff
yeah i would be maybe a little bit
worried as well huh
i would maybe a little bit worried as
well definitely betting the river here
blocking aces i think blocking aces here
is very important we're unblocking any
draws like for example yes we beat uh
king nine for example
but yeah can we really check all the
river i don't think so
so we use a little lace blocker and he
falls okay okay okay
bluff the okay to my tree
my job is done here sit out i'm just
kidding we're not gonna sit out yet
so here i uh check the flop to miss the
big bigs
shout out to mr big bags from canada i'm
gonna call the turn
river's interesting i'm gonna make a
little donkey donkey
you [ __ ] dunk you do it again i
remember in a video before i've told you
to not
dunk why do you do that don't dunk
well i did do it and he called me with
ace 10.
and now i'm gonna give a helmut theory
i'm gonna ask him if you checked
if i checked how much would you have bet
and then he says half the pot and then
you say you see
save me money there hellmuth area
there's a barrel here check out the flop
with jack 10. there's a three-quarters
barrel here which is interesting
definitely a spot where i expect to get
some splits and a lot of over bets
expect a check back nice
why put many people in the range why not
just call it out
say that he has nines is he really gonna
bet the river
he really got there with the five six
yeah he's five really
what is he thinking about
okay one third
uh yeah one third
75 100
i don't know man no [ __ ] aces
yeah that that was an option pocket asus
okay yeah gg you deserved the money
now i understand why you didn't want to
over at the turn greedy [ __ ]
that was well played like he really
lured me in there
you know if he would have over bet the
river ah
it would have overbought the turn no i
would have still caught do you want to
have a better understanding of what's

open up the king queen suited
and that's a bit decisive three but bad
timing my friend this is definitely
a hand that's on the higher part of our
range and it just improved
this hand could be in on the turn on
some turns at least
actually wouldn't even mind a flop race
it's not really a thing though on this
board but i wouldn't have minded
on this turn he's gonna check i'm gonna
do some small bad thing i would say
not too thrilled about it if i get check
raised i wouldn't be too
happy
but i do think it's one of these spots
where if he check raises i kind of have
to call it off i think
he can have the same hand but aces ace
king are gonna be very likely
um but hey he check calls
i'm gonna jam the river
because we have topper yeah i mean what
else do you want me to see
a lot of his hands that he's gonna play
this way are going to be bad calls
though
like jack stands
maybe he can find a call with a with a
diamond but
he didn't i do also think like a lot of
his value ads are just going to check
rip the turn so
i'm gonna go for the four bet
with the ice king
[Music]
he calls good flop
[Music]
gonna quarter it up
and we have pot kitties gonna make a
little through
i think i'm going to quarter it up again
here
[Music]
think this deep it probably calls a
little bit more 8x type of hand so a
little bit more suited connectors
probably calls queens a bit more often i
think ace king i'm gonna check the river
aces would definitely jam
there's still two combinations that
don't block king queen suited
and like for example having the king of
spades here makes
quite a big difference in the four
bedpod
touching bullets touching bullet guys
they're not getting get
they're not gonna catch me they're not
catching me
so i'll say something here oh
you gotta flop a set then you're gonna
lose a stack
if i dunk here that makes no sense
whatsoever
let's try a little donkey donkey i'm
gonna [ __ ] with floozer's mind
sorry gordon you [ __ ] thunk you do it
again i remember in a video before i've
told you to not
dunk why do you do that why do you do
that
so dumb yeah yeah yeah i'll make another
little betty betty
and here block again
i think i'm gonna block again
go for the block three bet let's go
flusoo doesn't know what's hitting him
he has two overs
[Music]
for example this doesn't mean go right
that you
found that you bet to not check a bit
too often ah let's try a little donkey
donkey guys
let's go let's go let's go you [ __ ]
dunk
you do it again i remember in a video
before i've told you to not
dunk why do you do that why
do you do that so dumb oh blokey another
green he goes for a little razor easy
oh we have uh we have quite a good hand
so i'm gonna call
yeah great analysis wacko great analysis
tell us more
that's a bad turn wish i had a set
oh really waco would you wish you had a
set wicca really
make a little blocky blocky here in the
river
a little small bet
i like this bed a lot too this is really
really kind of sexy
i know granny i know you find that sexy
my friend that's why i did it
to satisfy your pervy needs
yeah that's a straight guys we even have
some backup equity to go with it
nice noise very nice
pretty nice i like it i like it a lot if
he bets again i'm probably gonna race
with my backup backup t he checks
think if i had ace jack or something i
would probably check but having a queen
and a backup equity i think it's fine
the nine pairing
is less worse that's worse is that a
word
i mean the nine of hearts then of course
i also had a jack shout out to him
good check
and here we are gonna go for
a little 1b donkey donkey we check out
the flop
and here we are gonna go for uh i don't
know
now we have a king
i'm gonna go for the check
i think fluz is still gonna better queen
this crazy guy
[Music]
oh in a little checker is there a ds4
why not
me milo low frequency guys low frequency
we can solve anything where we have the
variables correct and then progress a
little more oh this is this is
this is what they call a good turn now
the question is do we check or do we bet
i think i'm going to check
man especially have mind that loss or
solving so we can solve anything where
we have all the variables correct and
then progress a little more learning and
making constant decisions
writing the ups and downs trying to
outplay our fellow men
that then provide security and a soul i
not flooded with fake information that
solves nothing strengthen the mind
and that means happiness
okay
i hope we're writing [ __ ] down guys
i'm gonna make a small bet here on the
river
and i think we have to call her race no
i'm not that happy about it
what do you have he had the seven deuce
he wanted to win money with the seven
deuce
shout out to the seven dudes guys get
your dolce gabbana
i'm gonna check this is uh as they call
a very uh
clearly this is a deliberate deviation
from the quote-unquote correct strategy
now i'm gonna go try to get some value
he calls i'm gonna get even more value
oh snap front gem all in
oh oh
canada canada canada canada guys from
canada
are usually not the craziest players
snap gem oh and we block
random factor one time also having the
queen
king five okay we were already
completely crushed
we were already shout out to the guy who
lays this down guys shout out to the guy
who lays this down
you guys tell me too much of a
too much of a few player or uh
a six is a six is a good end huh because
it's blocking a6
it's blocking pocket sixes while we face
a little format
gonna call
oh oh that's not a good flop
expression over suppression or
meditation i don't get even what occurs
when people say meditation is something
suppression expression over suppression
i really like that
an expression but there's a difference
between letting in your emotions and
expressing
and expressing your emotions basically
gonna call here
interesting turn because it could have
made him a jack
with like ace jack but it could have
also made him jacks with pocket jacks
right he checks
okay i take that one i take that one
call her with the king jack
why not
everyone says the goal is to get your
stacks in by the river
but you do more how important the mix
are bad small range and protected is
[Music]
yes and no who have here boat don't
think he's ever folding a flush draw
so i'm just gonna be big don't think he
has a folding range here basically
a6 off suit i guess but i'm just to
focus on coolering this guy
seems like the gto way to play this hand
while we have king queen we check on
cooler yes no
oh chop chop everyone loves a chop but
shall we do something funky guys
[ __ ] it let's go the overbet why
not as they say in spanish
when you feel it you feel it oh and
every river is straight
nice spot to draw a little donkey donkey
i wouldn't mind
he doesn't okay now it's up to us
you should probably bet i don't think he
ever has ace queen
does he ever have ace queen all right
it's full set on the turn unless he has
at least ace queen of clubs
i think we're kind of free rolling here
it's very hard for me to be bluffing
here he calls him mugs
king three students what the [ __ ] dude
hey i literally just said it's very hard
for me to be bluffing here and he calls
me with king three suited
supernova eight that guy is on a whole
nother level
you have planet earth here and he's
somewhere over there
i love it i was like it's very hard for
me to be bluffing here
but he just hands over his money
he just hands over his money you play
very well you play very very well
this is not something someone to learn
from rob
you play that as bad as you can your
career is finished
you are gone gone gone
obviously raising aces
he calls and he's gotta look good he's
looking good he's looking good good
looking good
make a small see that race
during ace this one's interesting
i think i'm gonna check
dubious dubious that's a very bad river
but obviously not going anywhere
doing that spots
king six
king six why not
why not so
dumb that's why you play this baby money
limit
