from another high stakes players journey
in today's episode welcome back to
another episode of the mechanics of
Poker podcast we are joined by the 2022
wsp Main Event Aspen yulen yat after
having won the main event Espen has
become a regular in the hro the scene
showing that unlike other Main Event
Champs he's not a one- hit wonder but
instead is here to stay and a force at
the table to be reckoned with what
stands out when I think of Aspen is how
calm collected and composed he is at at
the tables he contributes this to having
discipline and good habits with which he
has optimized his mind and body to be
able to perform to the best of his
ability as always I'm joined by a fellow
High performer normally the fittest guy
on these podcast but today we have a
serious Contender I'd say my co-host co-
mechanics of Poker coach Mr mindset and
performance Adam Carmichael Adam how can
our audience learn or what can they do
to be as cool and collected at the
tables as
Aspen that's a high standard to set I
say your external state is going to
reflect your internal state so to be
calm on the outside you've got to learn
to be calm on the inside that often
means having your expectations in check
and being very present in the moment
when you're most calm you're generally
very present you're quite confident but
you're trying to execute in the moment
and I think Espin from the outside looks
like he does that very well so we'll
explore how he's mastered that state
over the course of this podcast yeah I'm
very excited about that as well but

let's start the PO Aspen I'm uh happy
that we finally got to do this I believe
I first messaged you I think it was a
bit after your main event win so it's
almost like two years ago very busy guy
but happy we found a day to uh finally
make this happy especially now with
another wsp around the corner so welcome
to the pot
thank you thank you it's not even that
I've been that busy it's mostly that my
mind has been very busy I've had so many
things on my mind that I've basically
just said no to every podcast request
for the last 18 months or whatever it's
been yeah a lot going on so that's it
yeah it turns out that uh what winning
10 million is not uh just a matter of
next day it wires you to your bank
account and it's like oh happy times
right yeah there yeah there was quite a
bit of issues I didn't get paid out for
six months because um IRS didn't accept
my UK proof of residency and then there
was tax lawyers involved from Norway UK
and the US that process is still going
on but hopefully nearly finished so
there's been a lot of um yeah More Money
More
Problems yeah I mean I don't want to sit
here and complain about it because it's
a good problem to have obviously but but
it has added um Stress and Anxiety to my
life that's for sure but yeah not going
to complain no but but it does make
sense and sometimes also we think I know
exactly what you mean sometimes you're
like I'm maybe not actually busy in
terms of you know I'm not doing anything
every minute of my time but my mind
feels very busy because there's a lot of
things going on so I I can definitely
feel you but for the people I want to
actually start this pod out with like
quite of a banger of a question I would
say um I think that you've probably
asked this before but I'm looking to get
a more
serious answer and one with a more
constructive advice twist s to speak how
does one increase its chances to win the
W sop main event we all know and
understand that you know you need a bit
of luck but unless you have ways to
literally increase the chances of
winning a flip it's not it's not what
I'm interested
in yeah uh outside of the obvious
winning a lot of flips and getting Delta
acis versus Ace King in crucial spots
stuff like this
um I don't know like I would probably
say that my biggest Edge playing a
tournament like that is that I wasn't
really emotionally connected to the
outcome too much I was pretty laidback
and I didn't really
have of course you you can never like
remove all emotions and not have
expectations when you go deep in a
tournament like this but I would pretty
confidently say that I was the least
worried about the outcome when we went
into final two final table you know um I
felt that I I I had like a good I knew
what I was going to do I had like an
idea of the strategy I wanted to play um
and I was confident in my abilities like
of course um I didn't know every spot no
one does but I was pretty confident and
I I just didn't have any
emotional um stress or connected to the
outcome basically I was just there to do
my thing and yeah yeah I can imagine a
lot of people will uh will definitely
few the pressure I remember once I I I I
was moved to a final table and I never
or Final Table a televised table and I
never had that experience and then
suddenly you're like wait but people now
see everything I do so just that already
kind of [ __ ] with my mind imagine if
there's like 10 million on the line This
ability to like handle pressure in big
spots was it something that you think
you're naturally good at or what have
you done in order to stay calm when when
under such amount of pressure when the
spot is so
big I think it's some resilience that
you build up over time for sure but I
was always kind of Baseline guy you know
uh emotionally I'm not particularly I'm
never like super sad super angry super
happy I'm kind of a baseline kind of guy
where I'm not I don't have very big big
swings emotionally like that um I think
it's super beneficial for stuff like
poker
investing uh where you need to make
rational decisions maybe less of an
advantage in real life stuff like
relationships and other parts where you
benefit quite a bit from showing a bit
more emotions and being a bit
more
um yeah I I don't know really but I I
remember this from like way back when we
were playing like video games when we
were younger like when other um when
other guys to like slam keyboards and
smash their Mouse and curse at the gods
or whatever you know like if you lost
like some important game or whatever I
would always be the guy who was just
like okay we lost next game go again
whatever you know it's it's always like
been part of my um part of how I am I
think so definitely an advantage in
poker I would say and also you know like
I'm I'm single guy I don't have
responsibilities in life I don't have a
family to support I don't have a
mortgage I don't have um any of these
things that adds pressure to the
situation I had myself and I was already
in a good uh good position like I I was
already doing what I wanted to do and I
didn't really have these I think for a
lot of the guys at the final table um or
even like final two tables final three
tables like this mattered a lot you know
like this was life-changing stuff and
they were going to be able to pay down
their mortgage send their kids to
college they had all these like extra
stressor you know like um affecting
their mindset I didn't have any of that
I was like okay of course it would be
like a sick uh outcome and it would be
like a big bankroll boost but it's not
going to change anything I'm still going
to live the life that I'm living right
now um so yeah I I think that helps for
sure as
well do you ever
experience any sense of pressure for
example nowadays you play Love of Triton
High Rollers when you play against
tougher opponents do you have a few in
idated or is that also from that
perspective like doesn't do anything for
me um in the beginning I did I remember
like the first Triton Cypress that I
played it was like okay Ado to my left
lonus to my right [ __ ] am I doing here
you know like definitely felt a bit um
yeah strange the first time but you get
used to it of course and you realize
that okay these guys are actually not
gods they actually have the same uh
maybe not the same leaks but they also
have leaks they have stuff going on you
know like it's not they're not
unbeatable and I think after a while I
realized that these are human beings as
well and you don't need to be
intimidated sitting here you've studied
the game you can compete and yeah kind
of just yeah became more and more
natural with time I I do I do have like
some some anxiety in that sense playing
with these guys but that's more like an
ego thing where the anxiety comes from I
don't want to [ __ ] up a hand in front of
chidwick or Tim Adams or whatever you
know because I want these guys to think
that I'm a good player I don't want I I
had especially in the beginning I had a
lot of like this uh insecurity that I
didn't want people to think that I was
just some one hit wonder Main Event guy
that came like and I was going to like
blast off you know I wanted PE people to
think that I was a good player um
probably like childhood insecurities and
whatever shining through there I don't
know but stuff like this where I was
afraid of like playing hand bad because
yeah these guys were going to be like oh
my god did you see like this [ __ ]
main is this the main event
champ those yeah so I had some of that I
still have some of that um but to a
lesser degree now I would say was that
also then one of the reasons why you
jumped into like the High Roller scene
to kind of did you did you feel like you
have something to proof because I can
indeed imagine that the majority of the
world that knows a little bit about
poker well it's Aspen Aspen is the wsp
main event champ so he's the best he's
the goat but obviously you know as poker
players we kind of know that that it
works a bit like more so was kind of
kind of that did did you get motivated
by playing like these high RS to prove
that you were not the one they
fly yeah for sure and it was also a bit
about setting new goals after the man
mon because I I've had a different goals
throughout my poker career you know like
I started playing in 2004 uh and back
then my goal was just I didn't care
about money like uh I didn't have any
ambition of like retiring or anything
serious you know I just wanted to have
enough money to travel when I wanted to
and like party with my friends and stuff
like simple things you know um and then
the goal was just to beat the next guy
beat the next guy beat the next guy I
was treating it like a video game
because I came from video game
background so I was just treating it
like another video game where I wanted
to level up and beat the next guy and
whatever and I didn't have any emotional
um like I didn't think about the money
you know um and then I went to
University for uh six years and I I had
a real life job for one year and when I
came back to poker after that now I
suddenly understood okay money has value
like I should actually take this a bit
more serious and like try to um use this
for like actually try to build some
wealth as well not just like try to beat
the next guy or whatever but actually
like yeah take it a bit more seriously
um so for a few years then my passion
was like to retire myself retire my mom
you know like create some actual value
in terms of financial stability uh but
then after winning the B event that that
part was again like okay now I have this
money um but I still love playing poker
but it's not going to be the same like
logging back online and playing like the
banty Builder 215 you know as it was
before so now I kind of need to find new
goals again like what am I going to do
now um and then I kind of decided that
okay uh it would be cool to compete like
at a very highest level and try to see
if we can actually stack up against
these guys you
know how does your strategy change going
into a field like Triton compared to a
field like main event to kind of maybe
go back to like my first question is
there anything strategically and I also
heard you actually I I looked up some
some of your content before this podcast
and I heard you also talk about uh kind
of the meta uh strategy on like a meta
level maybe you can also elaborate on
that how how do you approach a
tournament like a big softer fi
tournament different than for example a
tougher lineup in the
Trion um uh well I I've only played the
man event twice but in general I would
say like the first time the first time
that played it the year I actually won
it I I wouldn't say that I had the best
approach to it honestly I was playing it
a bit to I was thinking oh you get all
these gifts all the time so you can just
like play Super safe don't take any risk
um at least in the beginning of the
tournament I was playing a bit like this
uh which I wouldn't necessarily say is
the best approach but I do think that
you have to pass up on a lot of smaller
edges in this tournaments like the main
event for example like in Triton like if
you're playing a tough 50k Triton for
example like these guys aren't going to
give up too much they're not going to
just hand you their stack randomly you
know um so you kind of have to take
like if you have like a four B shove
spot with A4 suited you probably just
have to take it because um you're not
going to find like any amazing spots
later you know while in the B event
maybe you skip that spot because uh in
an orbit or two this this guy from Texas
is just going to absolutely gift it to
you you know so it is a bit different in
terms of the variance you're um you
should take on in these tournaments I
would say yeah so for example if you
would look at a solver and you see okay
uh in this spot the bottom shove is A6
off maybe A6 off is not the bottom shove
in a WSB main event but maybe it's A10
off because there chance that Mr from
Texas is g to give you a stack next hand
so surviving to next hand has has more
value shout out to Mr Texas yeah no I
think um yeah I think for sure and like
also if you look at the solber if you
actually like look at the EV of the
shove like all these bottom shoves
they're going to make literally like
nothing they're going to be like break
even shoves right and if it's a break
even shove in theory then for sure just
skip it in these softer softer Fields
also it matters a lot of course like who
you have behind you because some
sometimes like A6 might be the bottom in
the solver but in real life it might
actually be like a giga print because
everyone is going to fold so much
tighter who's left to act you know like
maybe you're on the button and the two
blinds just are going to fold everything
they're going to fold a jack off if you
shove you know so
maybe at that point like also don't go
with the solver but actually think about
who are we playing against here what are
we doing you
know in terms of you know if we're
talking about leagues in in approach how
how does what do you think are like
common mistakes that people make when
they play like for example we got scoop
coming up big scoop is kind of kind of a
similar similar leak that that you can
think of or what are like some common
leaks that that Stak players have on
scoop I wouldn't say I'm the best player
to talk about this right now like for
the last year or two I've played scoops
and W cops and Sundays uh but I haven't
been grinding online as much as I did in
the Years prior to the main event right
so I like in terms of what leaks people
have
um I like for a series like scoop for
example I would say that it's uh
probably overloading on tables and just
autop piloting too much not paying
enough attention to what your strategy
is and what you're trying to do you're
just like loading up oh you get fomo
like this tournament has such a big
guarantee I have to play it suddenly you
have like 16 20 tournaments and you're
usually playing like eight and now
you're like okay um yeah so I don't know
I know people have very different
approaches with this like pads for
example he just loads up like in
infinite tables and he can handle it for
some reason I don't know like he he can
still like find power jams in like a
natural spots where like he can do like
crazy stuff but for me like if I play 20
tables I'm just autop piloting a lot I
find myself maybe it's just because I'm
getting older and slower and I remember
when I was younger I could play like
infinite tables but then again like the
strategies were a bit more simple back
then it was competition was easier so I
found it easier to play a lot of tables
then now I think competition is a lot
tougher I also play higher and my brain
probably works slower because I'm
getting older so yeah I don't know
depends if you're 22 years old then on
Rin you can probably just play like 24
tables no problem but for me it doesn't
really work like that anymore
so so H H how does one
determine which tournament to skip and
which to play like I'm sure nowadays for
you maybe it's a bit easier you just
play everything that's high and
naturally there won't be I guess there
will be way more lower buy an offer than
higher buy an offer um but what are some
advice that you can give when you say
okay don't load up on too
many which ones should they skip and
which ones should they definitely not
skip what are kind of the criteria to
look for I mean it kind of depends why
you're playing right like are you
playing to compete or are you playing to
provide for your
family like in terms of Roi of course
you play
um probably don't play like all the
highest buyin they're going to be very
low Roi for the most part um especially
on some sites maybe the structures are a
bit faster which is going to lower your
Roi a lot as well um so yeah Play Good
structures
high like big fields you know like high
guarantees in terms of the entries um
preferably freeze out or one re-entry
tournaments is better so you don't have
to play against uh malaka eight times
and pads seven times and European 12
times you know like if you're going to
have to beat these guys over and over to
actually get somewhere it's of course
going to toughen up the field a lot um
yeah you mentioned like the approach to
Poker if you want to have a high Roi if
you want to provide or if you want to be
competitive I think you also mentioned
you experienc this yourself right in
your poker career where you were just
focusing on beating the next guy and
then you were like well maybe I should
accumulate
wealth how does then your approach
differ because I can also see or I I
also had times where I would be like
okay I'm going to stop focusing on like
the more competitive games and I'll try
to bump up more but actually I was
zoning out more I was playing less so
actually in hindsight maybe a little bit
more competitive games would have
triggered my aame therefore actually I
would have made more money how did it
look different for you the approach I'm
going to beat the next guy to okay I
actually now going to focus on making
money what did you then do
differently um
um what did I do differently well it
it's such a long time ago like honestly
it was a different climate like I played
heads up cash for six years maybe and I
remember like maybe like I would say
maybe like the first three of those
years I was really hungry uh trying to
figure stuff out and like talking to
people about strategy and trying to get
better last three years I I kind of just
bum hunted didn't study too much I was
kind of like this is why I ended up
going to school as well because I kind
of lost passion for it or I didn't have
like the same Drive anymore um so I
don't
know tough question what changed like
when I got back I think I was just a bit
more mature and I just looked at the
game in a different way like I I was
pretty young back then and I was very
immature as well I would say like I had
spent most of my life just sitting in
front of a computer uh playing video
games and yeah I don't know I was very
immature so um yeah I didn't I just
didn't have the same respect for the
game or the opportunity that was in
front of me I think a lot of people that
were good at poker in6 78 uh kind of
regret that to spend so much time
partying playing World of Warcraft
whatever it was for them you know like
all of these time uh syns that
we me uh and other people like we spend
so much time doing these things instead
of taking poker seriously right um um I
like I definitely regret that many times
that I
just well I regret it but at the same
time like there's nothing to be done
because I wasn't mature enough to see
the opportunity and to grab it but yeah
it's what it is yeah it's like it's like
with with regret but also with
understanding because I mean when I when
I started as well if I should have
probably dedicated a bit more and then
could could have been made made way much
more money so I definitely understand
where you came from but it felt so easy
right you you sit down you get some
money it's like oh I want money and then
you go spend that money then you go sit
down again you you think that this is
like infinite that this is how it's
going to be and also when you were
younger you know or at least for me
speaking I didn't look so far into the
future that I didn't I remember once I I
I was with a couple of buddies money we
ran into like a guy who played already
very high stakes and he looked at us and
say hey guys you do realize the
opportunity you guys have on your hands
right now right I looked at my buddy we
were both standing in the club like okay
let's go party okay you know like no it
it didn't it only came later that we
understood like oh wait this is actually
a pretty big opportunity uh you actually
used to play cash games I think you
already mentioned heads up cash I
actually first heard about you I think
it was a Ser on YouTube from uniat you
guys were trying to make a million or
something a guy looking like Jesus was
also in there I remember that
guy yeah exactly uh yeah we had like a
vlog project uh I was playing
actually I had already started
transitioning to tournaments then I
guess but I but I was playing cash games
like so as I said like I stopped playing
in
201 11 maybe or something like that or
played less and less before that I was
playing a lot and then I went to
University for like six years and worked
one year maybe from 2010 something like
this um and after working I came back to
poker in
2017 and then I was playing cash games I
started playing like nl200 400 around
there uh on uniat which was incredibly
soft back then probably still is I have
no idea but it was Unreal how soft it
was like I came back to poker after
basically not studying I was just yeah
as I said like bum hunting some heads up
cash and not really taking it very
seriously for a lot of years right uh
and I came back and I immediately
started winning which it's yeah says a
lot about the games I think um so I I
came back into Cash games and I played
cash for maybe one or two years um
mostly just playing in the unibet games
because they were so variance free and
yeah I I didn't have much money at that
time so I kind of had to like uh build a
bank roll and do it like in a as safe as
way as possible uh so I basically built
my bank roll playing unibet cash and
then uh I was streaming on Twitch as
well so I got a sponsorship with unibet
um so I had some side income from that
as well and yeah just built from there
switched to MTS couple of years later uh
and then I was living with two Estonian
guys uh R tonan and R kilu uh both of
them named rno and we were living
together in talin Estonia and we were
doing this
um we kind of had the idea it would be
cool to remake this um two months 2
million project that was like Infamous
back in the days uh I think we called it
one year 1 million we going to try to
make a million between the three of us
um in poker and crypto I think was the
idea uh and this was like Peak bull
market times so I think we were a bit
delusional about how easy crypto was we
definitely got wrecked pretty hard in
crypto over the next six months or
whatever so that did not contribute to
the final number in a positive way um
yeah spoiler we didn't make it I think
we probably made like 300K or something
between us not uh not not Amazing by any
means but yeah
um yeah what was the question I'm just
ranting now what was the question no the
first the first time you saw me yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah I didn't really ask
a question actually the question that I
was going to ask based on based on your
experience why did you switch to
mtts I I think I just saw more future
potential in in it I I thought like as
poker online is getting harder and
harder and um maybe there was a bit of a
worry at that time as there is now as
there's been forever that cheating is
going to become more prevalent maybe
it's going to be harder to cheat in mtts
because you have so many variables in
the game you have different stack sizes
different uh parts of the tournament
with different different ICM effects you
have all all these things right
different payout structures so I figured
like probably tournaments is a bit more
here to stay um and also just way softer
format I felt like cash games were
getting like kind of tough um maybe not
on uniat but at that time I was like
moving up a bit in stakes and I was
playing like some 52 510 a little bit of
1020 on stars and stuff like that and
the games were pretty tough um so I
figured maybe tournaments is like more
long-term better long-term idea and also
I I I found it a lot more fun to play
tournaments really uh games were
starting to feel like a bit of a grind
to me um which is I think what kind of
killed my passion for the game in the
first place when I was playing heads up
cash like in the end it kind of just
became a grind I was just like okay
rinse and repeat um and cash game had
become a little bit like that for me so
I think I needed to like do something to
give me a back a bit more passion again
for the game and mtts seemed like a good
way to do that the two guys that I was
living with uh the estonians were also
playing mtts so yeah sounds like a
strategical novelty is definitely a way
that you get re triggered or remotivate
into the game yeah how do you make sure
nowadays that this strategical novelty
is present so you remain motivated or is
just the competition that you face on a
daily basis
enough um good question good question
like these are struggles that are kind
of present over the last couple of years
where after winning the main event a lot
of people were asking me why don't you
just [ __ ] off to some beach destination
and enjoy your life you know like play
some poker for enjoyment but don't why
do you want to sit in front of a
computer all day and study Sims to try
to prove something to someone like why
do you care just enjoy your life
and uh yeah enjoy The Spoils of all the
hard work you put in for last years you
know like you're the lucky one you got
it you know like just enjoy it and part
of me wanted to be like yeah actually
you're right why am I doing this like I
I don't need to prove anything like but
then there is this insecurity inside of
me that's Whispers in my other ear that
no you do need to prove something you do
need to actually so I don't know it's a
constant struggle for me
and yeah it I don't know it's also a
part of it
is like now I'm in a good position to
play a lot of Poker and do a lot of
stuff in
poker first of all I have some momentum
from winning some tournaments over the
last few years um I have some
recognition I have some uh following
some
people uh watch when I put out content
and stuff like that so I have like some
opportunities for sponsorship income and
stuff like that and I've also dedicated
a lot of time over the last years to
become u a reasonably good poker player
so I can make quite a bit of money just
from playing poker right so it does feel
like now if I
just go to whatever Beach location and
live life that I'm leaving a lot on the
table
which feels selfish as well to some
degree I don't know like for me I I grew
up in Norway and we didn't have a lot of
money like uh my family we didn't have a
lot of money of course in Norway you're
not like the government is like very
they take care of you so even if you're
you don't have a lot of money you're not
on the street you're okay uh so we were
always okay but like I really feel like
now that I could I could just like keep
pushing and keep working and like keep
grinding and I can make a lot of money
you know and support my family and do
all these things so there
is I don't know yeah you feel like it's
a sense of like you have this
opportunity and because it wasn't there
in the past like you have to take it
like it's like you cannot say no yeah
and I'm also not oblivious to the fact
that I'm incredibly lucky to be in this
position right like insane coincidences
for me
to meet the right people at the right
time that has helped me get to where I
am now incredibly lucky to win this
tournament that tournament especially
the main event of course uh but all
these tournaments and whatever I'm like
I'm real lucky to be where I am and it
feels kind
of I don't know it just feels like
selfish
and I don't know
yeah yeah I this is clearly something
that I'm like constantly thinking about
and I haven't really um clearly spent
enough time thinking about it because I
I haven't figured out what is right what
is wrong here um part of me wants to
relax a bit more part of me wants to
keep going and really like maybe start
vlogging again you know maybe I like vog
I was a bit sad I was a bit sad to see
that they
stopped yeah I really like them they
showed a very good Insight in terms of
what does it look like you know to
travel the world playing
poker yeah and I kind of enjoyed making
them as well it it is just one of those
things where it takes quite a lot of
effort and in terms of headp space and
it's not cheap to make them and if you
don't really have any Roi on it like
sponsorship income or someone who's
paying for the Vlogs it's kind of just
you're doing
it yeah for no reason kind of like the
we have to hit the Donate button on the
Vlogs off no of course no I'm not saying
like I'm yeah like if someone offered me
a sponsorship now to restart the Vlogs
I'm not sure if it would be a thing for
me but yeah maybe um I'm just saying
like
I don't know all of these things that
you do outside of Poker as
well because I I've done lot of
different content in poker like I was
streaming I was vlogging I I've done
like different things and I remember
when I was streaming the reason I quit
streaming was that I felt that I
couldn't be the poker player that I
wanted to be if I was streaming you know
like if you're streaming for eight hours
five times a week or whatever trying to
have energy heads space time whatever to
put in enough study outside of that to
actually be like top top player I just
don't think it's a thing really um which
is the reason you don't see anyone doing
it you don't see mikita Jason [ __ ] uh
chidwick any Tim Adams any of these guys
you don't see them streaming on Twitch
or vlogging or whatever why because it's
not really a thing I honestly head space
right right you mentioned your head
space like like you you already need off
f space to play
poker yeah it takes a lot it takes a lot
for sure and maybe you want to do some
stuff outside of Poker as well you know
maybe have like I don't know kids wife
dog commitments I don't know I don't
know anything about any of those things
but you're describing my life man Kid
Dog
yeah so you you mentioned like that some
people say why don't you just go to the
beach and then they said just play poker
for fun would you be able to play poker
just for fun because if I if I hear that
and I talk about myself I find actually
poker the most enjoying and the most fun
when when you're really at it you know
you're reviewing your assess you're
looking to get better that process of
like oh wow like strategical novelty oh
[ __ ] you know I can do this I can do
that you put it on the table you execute
it you see it working that's what gets
me fired up so if I would just be
sitting there and trying to enjoy my
brain would automatically be like hey
this spot's quite interesting maybe I
should look up this and this is a thing
like it it probably won't stop so just
playing poker for fun
enjoyment it's it's I I wouldn't be able
to do
it I I doubt it would be purely for fun
I I think I would always like even if I
took a step down and decided okay I'm
going to play like one case to five case
you know stuff like this um probably
still I would like review hands discuss
strategy I just wouldn't be like Omega
try hard you know I think there's like a
difference there where yeah I don't
think I would ever just like rule around
and like like truly play for fun you
know I would still always try I think I
love trying um yeah it's kind of the
reason why I stopped playing video games
over the last one or two years as well
like before this I was playing like
quite a bit of DOTA Counter Strike stuff
like this but now I haven't touched it
for one and a half years because I'm
just so bad at the games now and it
really sucks to play when you're really
bad like sucks when your team always has
to carry you and you're like I don't
know it's not so fun anymore
thenl gam like you get you get like a
12-year-old kid screaming to you in the
mic like hey ASO what the [ __ ] it's like
what I'm getting beat by a 12-y old kid
what's going on yeah yeah no so yeah I
think it's if you're going to do
something I like doing it right you know
and I like trying when I'm doing stuff
so exactly that that's kind of what
gives the enjoyment and you hear that
quite a lot I think a bit more true in
the npt world because you kind of have
that like oh I hate poker I just want to
make a Big [ __ ] and kind of get out of
there feel like him cash that's a bit
less because it's a bit more of a grind
but I I personally never really felt
that way but I also feel like if you
play poker really sort of hating it and
hoping for a [ __ ] you know if we talk a
little about like Law of Attraction R
spirituality I don't think it's going to
happen
yeah yeah I I think there is some to
this law of attraction or whatever I
there was a girl who I was trying to
date a few years ago and she forced me
to read this um the secret I got like
halfway through it and I couldn't finish
it I was just no the author was talking
about like
this he he made an example where like if
you were driving to your workplace if
you just imagine imagin hard enough that
your favorite parking spot was going to
be free when you got there it was going
to be free and I was just no stop like I
I I I agree you can visualize stuff and
you can like I don't want to say
manifest because yeah I'm so over that
whole thing but you I I do believe in
visualization like you can visualize
technique and there's like a bunch of
evidence from Sports Science and
whatever about this right like that's a
big thing
but yeah anyways big rant whatever that
that wasn't where I was planning to go
with that but anyways so um in terms of
like hating poker wanting to get a Big
[ __ ] and get out of it
seems like a very very bad idea and very
bad place to come from right um I think
the thing thing that makes Poker so
enjoyable is if you can just play
without yeah you just love the game like
you see most of the people that are at
the top they do just love the game right
they they didn't come into it because
they were going to try to make infinite
um and I know I'm like kind of
contradicting myself now because I said
when I came into poker after working I
had more respect for money and I was
trying to make money and I don't think
there's anything wrong with that like
trying to make money it's a reasonable
thing but if your only passion for the
game is the money you don't really have
any love for the strategical concepts or
anything like this it's going to be
really tough I think like for me if I'm
if I played a big hand and I I I start
like deep diving into the solver after
to see if I [ __ ] up or not or what's
going on here like I love that process
like that puzzle process you know it
it's it's like a video game right like
my favorite video game series when I was
a kid was Zelda The Legend of Zelda
which is like a lot of puzzles all the
time you know it's like bit of like
combat stuff but mostly puzzle solving
right and those puzzle games I always
loved and poker is very similar like
when you start deep diving into the
solvers it's very similar to puzzle
games I would
say Adam I'm
curious if you hope open enough does
indeed a parking spot is available can
you give us like some evidence I
Remember by the way Mr Mr Conor McGregor
Big Fan I heard him say that he he he
also read the book secret and he was he
loved it uh and he I think he
contributes actually a lot of his
success to like manifestation and stuff
like that and I remember him saying that
I he was in his car I hope the park was
free and then he said it was free
obviously it's confirmation confirmation
bias usually uh but to to which degree
is there truth and how can I and I know
you do also also believe but I I I I
agree like the secret basically it tells
you that you know the universe just like
a shopping uh online shopping site right
everything cost zero money you just
click buy and you have it kind of that
idea maybe it's maybe they tried to sell
it like that but what's like the truth
and what's not so true maybe you can
educate tough question tough question is
like what's what's the what's the rules
of the universe
I think a lot could be Fooled by
Randomness in terms of those poking
spaces but at the same time there's
definitely an an element of attraction
that goes on if you think about it in
terms of putting energy into something
thoughts or energy if you put your
thoughts towards something for long
enough you're put energy into that thing
that leads your actions alignment with
it and there's definitely forces going
on there that are going to increase your
likelihood of events now when it comes
to where that can be applied to
manipulate our physical environment
we've got a um yeah taking a lot of
factors one if I imagine a car space but
then 50 other people also Imagine empty
car space are we all competing for that
one space does the does the does the
universe open up a new car park like
it's one of those things where we can go
around in circles trying to figure that
out I think we've got to just understand
the basic concept of put your time
energy into things that you want I think
McGregor is a great example he seems to
manifest every single thing he wants in
the world with just like kind of he
decides he's doing it he does it but
also he takes action every day and he's
a driven guy so there's you got to meet
meet that kind of um intentionality with
your actions as well what happens then
if you on a day-to-day basis feel like
you hate the game and you are hoping for
the [ __ ] what's kind of the energy you
put out then what's kind of what what
kind of what kind of happens what's the
negative I assume it's negative what are
kind of the negative consequences or
maybe the
signs well you create a lot of
resistance to the outcome you want all
right so that's going to lead a lot of
you're you feel like you can take action
from any emotional state but if you're
negatively coming your grind and you're
hoping to Bing something to get yourself
out of a situation you're basically
creating a lot of negative energy and
resisting the thing that you actually
want if if you really think about it
you're almost like pushing yourself
pushing away the thing that you want so
you you end up being less receptive to
Opportunities less receptive to the
thing that you actually do want and yeah
without getting too far down the down
the kind of um the kind of Road be Road
of where this kind of goes it's
basically just creating like a obstacle
to what you want I think all of us can
agree no matter what your beliefs are
that if you put your energy into what
you want instead of what you don't want
you're going to increase the likelihood
of getting that thing whereas most
people if you look at their thoughts
throughout their days a lot of trying to
get away from debt trying to get away
from Bad situations trying to get that
[ __ ] to get them out of what they're in
so it's all these all these kind of th
patterns are often occurring around what
people don't want and then trying to
change things so yeah I think if we
could be conscious of that and try to uh
put our thoughts in alignment what we do
want we're going to create yeah less
resistance and a more direct path which
leads more actions and more congruency
to what you want so yeah I think that's
that's the the main
Concepts like of course if it leads to
action that's great like if it leads to
action and that's where all the benefit
comes from right in my opinion that's
where the benefit comes from if your
manifesting leads to action uh but it's
actually very interesting to hear your
perspective of of this because I know
where you live and I know that where you
live there's a lot of people that don't
want to put in maybe the effort they
just want to manifest it they just want
to think about it until it drives in
their life you know or whatever um so
yeah that's interesting but yeah yeah I
I live in B for for reference and a lot
of people in Bali have a very spiritual
background and they go quite far to the
extreme end of they can manifest
anything from a beach or without any
work at all and a million which arrive
in their bank account just because they
had a little thought that it would so
yeah there's a I definitely go more to
the action camp with a intentionality
and kind of vision behind that I think
if you can pair the two I there's no
right or wrong Concepts there's always a
a gray in the middle and a merger of
Concepts and when you take one to its
extreme you end up kind of missing the
kind of big picture all right I want to
go into your journey a little bit so you
arrived on the the the main pocket scene
the kind of global pocket scene when you
won the main event but your pocket
Journey started way before that I think
around 2004 talk us through some of the
big steps you had early in your career
and what led you to transition into
going back to University which we we'll
talk to as well so that early career
what was the the kind of Main step and
Stones
there yeah so I I was playing a lot of
Warcraft 3 uh back in the days um and
like from Warcraft 3 there was one of my
clan mates that started playing poker
and he kind of told me that like you
should try this game out it's very cool
uh you can make money it's very fun blah
blah blah I started playing uh and there
was a lot of older kids in my hometown
as well uh that was playing the game
they were like one or two years older
than me so I started playing some home
games with them started playing some
free rolls online just to learn the game
um got fell in love with the game like
very early and just ordered like all the
best books um which was at that time
like theory of Poker by David sansky
super system 2 by D Brunson like this is
like very very in the beginning like
these books are now for the most part
complete dust of course like theory of
Poker probably has some good stuff still
because it's like fundamental stuff you
know but a lot of these poker books are
now of course very obsolete but yeah I
bought all the books grinded through
them uh read all the Forum posts
um yeah watched training videos did
everything I could basically to get
better at the game
um and yeah just went kind of Allin on
poker for some years um started I think
my clanmate sent me like 50 bucks on
poker stars and I think I won like a $3
tournament kind of early for like 300
bucks or something uh and from there
just yeah never never had to redeposit
again just didn't
have really big down swings at all
because the game was so easy back then I
played fixed limit for the most part for
the first year maybe two years um and if
you just played like if you just had
like an opening range you knew like what
kind of hands you were supposed to play
from different positions and a bit about
like seing strategy you were printing so
you just like didn't have swings back
then I think I there was something crazy
I think I didn't have a losing month for
seven years or something something
ridiculous like that you know you just
couldn't lose if you tried to if you had
good bankroll management and yeah it was
just kind of easy and of course like a
lot of people back then just saw poker
as like a online ATM you could just log
on and click some buttons and collect
money uh which is why a lot of us also
didn't take it that seriously and didn't
really capitalize on it because we
thought it was like an endless source of
money like yeah but of course um as we
touched on before it's not really the
case anymore anyways um I switched from
fix limit hold them to no limit hold
them six Max cash uh played sit and G
for a while played tournaments for a
while ended up in heads up cash games
played that for six years or whatever
um yeah kind of quit I played poker
every year after quitting as well but
not a lot just enough to supplement my
uh
what is it called like the money you're
getting while you're studying like the
government gives you money for like food
and rent and stuff like that um yeah I
don't know the English word for this
anyways I just played poker a bit to
supplement H yeah to supplement for this
and to live a bit more comfortable
lifestyle but I wasn't really trying
um I studied for six years like uh I
studied three years of bre food science
in Norway and then I went to Copenhagen
to study Brewing science so I was going
to be like a beer beer guy I was very
interested in beer for a few years um
ended up working in a Norwegian Brewery
like as a brewing scientist U mostly
working laboratory analyzing beer making
different beer Styles stuff like this um
and then I quit my job moved to Budapest
Hungary to start my own Craft brewery
that was the idea um I was going to play
poker on the side to like basically pay
for this Craft brewery that we were
starting
um but at some point I realized okay I
actually have to choose now do I want to
do this Craft brewery or do I want to do
poker because uh both of them are
obviously big uh projects and uh I was
streaming on Twitch at the time as well
it was like early in my unibat streaming
days so I figured I can't really do both
of these things it's too much of a Time
sync and beer felt like it was always
going to be an option I can always do it
later I have the education I have the
knowledge and whatever poker is kind of
an opportunity that's here and now like
the game is getting tougher and tougher
every year um I was already making like
quite a bit more money uh playing poker
than I was in my uh job in a brewery so
I figured poker is probably the safer
option also giv me a lot of freedom and
yeah so kind of went back Allin into
poker um broke up with my then
girlfriend living in Budapest and moved
to Malta with three other poker players
instead so complete change of lifestyle
and yeah I went from like being in a
relationship working like a 9 to5 job in
a serious like kind of corporate
structure life uh to now living with
three other guys in Malta you know
clicking buttons for a living again so
complete shift of um yeah mindset
lifestyle very yeah big
shift
um yeah as I said just played like nl200
NL 400 for a few years then switched
over to tournaments um
had a lot of Fortune I would say I
didn't really have big down swings I I
remember I had like one big downswing
when I switched to tournaments uh but I
was very self imposed and very I was
very aware of the risk I was taking I
would say so at the time I probably had
net worth of like 200k and I lost like
100k taking shots in tournaments but I
always knew that if I go on like a big
downswing I can just grind it back in
these unibet cash games because my graph
there was just straight up because the
games were so soft so I always thought
like okay I can take some shots in
tournaments and like treat it as
a as like a learning experience kind of
like I was playing 5Ks without selling
action and stuff like this you know
which looking back obviously like not
the brightest idea but I think at the
time it was
a reasonable thing to do I I always had
I also had like a very flawed perception
of tournament Rags uh the perception
back then was that if you were a cash
rag you knew how to play poker you
understood poker at like a quite deep
level while this turny guys they didn't
have a clue what was going on you know
they were so bad this tournament guys
that was the perception I feel like back
then at least in the cash game community
so I think I was a bit like
uh yeah I I thought was better than I
was for sure I was completely of course
clueless in a lot of ICM spots lot of
short stack situations um so I I
probably thought I was winning and
probably a lot of the tournaments I was
playing I wasn't I was probably losing
quite a bit uh looking back at it but I
think that's what keeps poker so popular
and yeah everyone just thinks they're
better than they are it's such a classic
thing in poker I think um and I was
definitely a victim of that back then um
but yeah then um tournaments kind of
yeah I started learning more and more
about tournaments and started taking
that a bit more seriously and had quite
early success I would say so had like
quite an easy easy rise in tournaments
very lucky to just yeah not have too
many

and maybe you will get a chance to work
with me and Adam and make more progress
in your poker career but for now without
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode now you
mentioned when we asked in the
questionnaire that you didn't have any
Rock butter moments then as you were
telling your story there you mentioned a
having a 200k rooll and like losing 100K
of it like playing some sh Tak some
tournaments and for some people that
would be like a very big story they'd be
like I lost half my role and they'd be
like a kind of negative connotation
around that for you you was kind of
brush past that no big deal I was making
money playing cash H so for you there's
two questions within this one is what do
you think allowed you to have a smooth
ride in poker in terms of your approach
to the game and what allows you to take
relatively big losses and not freeing
them as a
loss good question I guess it comes to
this like emotional disconnect that I
mentioned before that I didn't really
because I I said in the questionnaire
that I didn't have any Rock Bottom
moments like I didn't have any big like
emotional like emotional impact on me
you know like losing half my role there
going down to 100K the way I remember it
today at least was that I was like okay
fine I'll
just like take it easy with the
tournaments for a while and just grind
it back up in cash I always knew this
was like a reasonably High likelihood
thing to happen if I play these buin
they happened okay we rebuild we go on
that was kind of it and I also had like
a big um big loss in crypto before
winning the Ben event which was kind of
similar feeling where I lost like a
third of my net worth which was um now
like quite a bit higher and I lost
like so I I lost like no I lost
two-thirds of my net worth actually not
one third I lost two-thirds of my net
worth most of it was in crypto and um at
that point as well it was kind of
similar feeling where okay I have to
readjust I have to play lower buyin that
I was planning to play now but I wasn't
like I don't know it it also happened in
the middle of a series it happened in
middle of May so not the best timing in
terms of like keeping your head focused
on the games and whatever but I remember
even then I wasn't really like Rock
Bottom basement you know like yeah it
was fine
um so I don't know maybe I've had more
swings in my career
than looking back at it I think I have
just that that didn't affect me too much
maybe that's just it yeah so as you
mentioned I think the ability to reframe
things or not to uh not to frame things
as a negative is obviously a big skill
you have I think I remember reading your
Instagram post around this time when you
had the big Luna crash and you lost a
lot of your role and you were being very
vulnerable and sharing like what your
kind of plans were going forward this
was before you wion the main events I
remember thinking wow this is very
level-headed but also um yeah it's quite
vulnerable to put yourself on the line
that you've lost a part of your net
worth and now you're going to have to
adjust your approach to PO going forward
but it seemed like you did it from a
very just calm place which again like
it's a a skill set you've you've built
you mentioned H you built resilience
over time from being around poker and
also you're quite a level headed
character in terms if you don't go too
high too low but I think like the highs
lows Rock bottoms a few players would
have mentioned these events as like Peak
Rock moments in their their lives where
you just kind of went I've had a smooth
ride um smooth for you might be a bit of
a up and down for another person so I
think their skills that you've obviously
formed I want to talk now about you
being a high performer so when I think
about Espin I think High performer very
um thinks a lot about the lifestyle
factors that go into performing at the
high level what are some of the things
you feel cultivate high performance for
yourself and you've shown up as your
best self and does that differ in an
online environment compared to say a
live series
yeah so I think for me this is I don't
want to sound too repetitive but but it
all stems down to Childhood insecurities
and Egos and like how you channel that
into um doing good things I think for me
at least like I think that's a big part
of my success and I also think it's a
big part of this resilience that we
spoke about before
where so my adult life has
been pretty easy I would say very little
downswings in my adult life it's been
very uh like one big upswing for the
most part but my early life my childhood
and teenage years were maybe the
opposite I would say like I didn't have
like particularly easy childhood um I
was surrounded by a lot of alcohol and
drugs when I was younger like my dad was
um alcoholic drug dealer like a lot of
it was kind of messy messy times um some
parts of my childhood and I think maybe
this has made me a bit more resilient
to what seems like minor problems later
in life where you start like
comparing
yeah some stuff that would affect PE if
you've had like the easiest life ever
and you've never had any
trauma any like difficult situations or
whatever if you face minor stuff later
in life they're probably going to affect
you quite a bit right but if you started
off by having a lot of emotional trauma
a lot of difficult
situations um I was also like very like
during elementary school high school I
was like a little weird fat kid you know
like no social antennas very weird
anxious little kid and obviously not a
popular kid at school um
and I think that combined with like not
having the easiest time at home and all
of this I think it kind of creates this
resiliency later where if you run into
problems later in life you're you're
kind of just they kind of don't hit you
the same way I think um and I think
there's a lot of evidence if you see
like
the if you go back to the all
like people who Channel their
insecurities and childhood uh issues and
Egos and stuff into doing good things I
think there's quite a bit of evidence of
this like the people that were like the
jocks that were crushing it in high
school uh the popular guy who like got
all the girls who was like the captain
of the football team or whatever pickier
classic cliche scenario right um a lot
of these people maybe don't have the
same Drive later in life to prove
something while the Nerds the guys who
got picked on on the little fat guys or
the guys who are like in the chess club
or whatever maybe they have a bit more
reason later in life to prove something
they want to make up for um they want to
prove to the jocks that were bullying
them in sixth grade you know that uh and
not this loser that you called me like
you know I think there's a lot to this
and um I think that's that has been like
a big part of
my success in poker and in uh you
mentioned like high performance in terms
of like getting in better shape and all
of this like I mentioned I used to be
like very out of shape when I was
younger now I'm in like reasonable shape
um and I think that's like also just
based because of this that I I got
picked on for being fat now I'm trying
to get in now I'm trying to have a
six-pack to prove them wrong you know
it's it's so yeah I came from not having
any money when I was younger now I'm
trying to make all the money I I used to
not uh like all of these things you know
it's so
like if you do like some psycho analysis
or like self um if you look a bit into
the past it's sometimes kind of easy to
figure out why we do certain things it's
like a lot of it just stems from
childhood stuff right and I think that
was a big part for me that
I'm channeling this childhood stuff into
into my adult life and trying to use it
for something positive so yeah yeah and
I think that's the main thing like that
ability to channel it in the right
direction ction CU other people would go
through similar experiences and it would
overwhelm them they might not build that
resilience and yeah when I think of
resilience as a skill almost everyone I
know who's mentally tough who's got a
lot of resilience has gone through hard
times you almost build character
resilience through adversity and it's
quite a shame that that's the case but
if you have a quite shelter life or an
easy life you're probably not going to
be resilience because you haven't built
those character traits it's like
building muscles in the gym you can't
get those without lifting the weight so
I think resilience you've definitely
built that and then you mentioned this
kind of need to prove something I'm sure
we all experienced this to some degree
and depending on how your childhood went
you might have this more or less
depending on how you want to improve
impress your parents as well that's a
big one for trying to proove things as
you've started to achieve a lot of the
things so like you said you've you
wanted the success you wanted the U the
good better body and lose the weight
you've started to like from the outside
at least like kind of prove these things
already what happens that next level do
you still feel like you tap back into I
still want to prove something I know you
mentioned going back into uh the kind of
high roller scene to kind of still prove
you weren want Wonder but on a on a
deeper level do you feel like you're
transitioning your motives from having
to prove to other people while you're
doing stuff to a few more bit more
intrinsic because I feel like at some
point we can transition out of that we
can see our operating system we can see
what's Driven our past behaviors and how
we've utilize that as a fuel source we
go awesome it's got me to where I am but
then we can start think okay right now
I'm here now I'm at the where I want to
be I've proved everyone wrong all right
what do I want to do for me what's what
do I want what's my kind of goals have
you do you feel like you're
transitioning into uh understanding what
Espin wants and what his goals are going
forward that's definitely the next step
of the journey I would say I'm
definitely not there yet I still have um
stuff that I'm dealing with
and yeah I don't know I'm
not yeah I'm not there yet for sure like
this year I my focus is going to be a
bit to try to land and to remove some
stress and anxiety from My Life um like
because before winning the main event
like as I said my uh adult life was big
upswing only I didn't have much stress
anxiety uh I felt pretty resilient like
I think you mentioned like a lot of
people that face adversity it becomes
overwhelming and for me it was
definitely that as well when I was
younger like in my teenage years this
was the reason I was playing all these
video games right like why I was in a a
Roth playing World of Warcraft 14 hours
a day it wasn't because uh only because
I thought it was a great game it was of
course like my escape from the outside
outside world right I think this is very
common uh I'm very happy that I chose
video games as my Escape since there are
a lot of worse ways to do this I think
um but yeah now like later in life it's
been um like before winning the mement I
knew exactly what I was doing where I
was going what my goals were how I was
going to reach them uh I was living in a
Grindhouse in London with with uh some
fellow Norwegian Pros a shout out to PRS
Jonas and Ben uh we were living in a
Grindhouse this was during covid this
was actually like the I would say the
most formative years of my poker career
because while the world was in shutdown
and for most people this was like a
pretty traumatic time or for a lot of
people right people lost their jobs it
was like not a great period for the
world overall uh I would say for me it
was like for my poker career at least it
was a very good time um basically I was
forced to reduce my travel to
essentially zero we were locked in in
this house in London where we had
nothing else to do really than work out
study and play poker that was it um so
during the co years I I would say like I
was also like living with uh prbs as I
mentioned who was like one of my Idols
in the MTT world he was like always like
the best uh MTT player from Norway and
living with him and getting to talk
poker strategy with him like uh every
day um study with him and like just be
surrounded and see how him and the other
guys I was living with as well who were
all like very hard workers very hard um
yeah they had like good mindsets for
becoming s successful you know they
would they would just like every day
just study play do do the right thing
you know very very motivational uh crew
to live with um so during those years I
improved a lot and it was
very how to say
like I like during these years I just
loved it the process you know I Lov the
process I had no stress no anxiety very
easy uh I would say that after the main
event my life has kind of turned upside
down in that sense and I've had a lot
more stress and
anxiety after winning the main which I
don't want to call it like a negative
thing it's just part of it is just what
it is and it's natural I think um of
course I'm super happy um that I want to
ment it did change me in some ways
where I'm just now starting
to trying to land a bit again you know
in terms of these anxiety levels and
stress levels and whatever um I think
you mentioned actually like I was so I
had like this health scare or whatever I
should call it like three months ago
when I was in Bali actually where uh I
was trying to sleep it's like midnight
I'm in bed listening to a podcast trying
to sleep I'm super relaxed I don't have
any stress anxiety whatever I'm just in
bed relaxing suddenly my chest tightens
up like super hard and I I'm am
struggling to breathe and my pest chest
is super painful and I'm like okay the
[ __ ] is going on so I go um to the
hospital um and they do all this uh EKG
and all these heart tests they can't
really find anything um they give me
some like muscle relaxing and whatever
and send me home and they said that they
thought maybe it was like some muscle
spasm or something like that because I
was working out a lot in this period but
so I posted about this on Instagram and
a lot of people messaged me that it
sounds like a panic attack anxiety
attack and after I read more and more
about it I I'm I started to think maybe
that was it actually because even though
I wasn't in this
period like in this period I was
stressed and anxious more than yeah I've
been I had a lot of stuff uh in my head
that was floating around but in this
moment I didn't I wasn't stressed I was
trying to sleep you know I was very
chill so I didn't really think of panic
attack or anxiety attack as an option I
also never had issues with this before
so I didn't really think that could be
it but reading more about it it seems
kind of likely um since I have been
dealing with all these things like as I
mentioned with like um the payouts and
the tax stuff and investment stuff and
there's like a lot of stuff that I've
been like churning through after the
amend mon
um so yeah like now this year my focus
has kind of been like especially after
this episode where I I kind of got like
a wakeup call that okay maybe you need
to actually like
take take a bit more care of your mental
health and not um try to do everything
at once and yeah land a few projects
before you start new ones you know and
yeah that's kind of where I am right now
where I'm trying to yeah um get back
into the state where I was before the
main event where I was just happy
thriving like grinding doing my thing
you know and not
yeah yeah so interesting right so for
you like from the outside we can see you
won the main events and all these
opportunities become available and it
seems like the dream scenario that
everyone wants but at the same time you
can see how it just changes your whole
kind of ecosystem of life where life is
so simple you went a grind house you
play poker now it's like what do I doing
my money should I invest here should I
invest there should I play this highroll
event should I all the opportunities
that are available that seem like good
problems like just overload the mind cuz
there's no clear answer I'm sure you
could make an argument if you do pros
and cons should I go to this Stu yes I
should should I invest in this maybe I
should and all of these are taken up
like in a real estate in your heads and
all of a sudden you had a very simple
life sit down grind and now you've got
to U kind of deal with challenges and if
you look at a lot of celebrities
especially I always feel a little bit
sorry for anyone gets famous young like
say you're 16 at Justin Bieber and
you're a mega star at like 16 how on
Earth do you like process what you want
in life with the opportunities that are
available it's just must it must
Overlord you and you see a lot of
obviously people get famous turn to
alcohol or drugs to uh kind of numb out
a bit of the the things that are going
on internally so for you obviously
you've found ways to deal with it but at
the same time there's there's lots going
on internally that's creating this maybe
panic attack or stress response where
your body's almost like I don't feel in
that relaxed state so you mentioned from
there you want to get back to uh how you
are feeling in 2022 or before the main
event what are some of the things that
help you to get more balance I know
you're big on health and your routines
maybe talk us through some of the habits
and routines that you feel almost
valuable to you at the moment to make
sure you're you're putting your health
first yeah
so I I used to have a lot of good
processes in my life that I've kind of
fallen out of um and I've fallen out of
them because I've been more stressed and
more anxious and whatever but of course
it should be opposite this is actually
when you should be doing a lot of these
things right um for example meditating I
used to have like a good routine for
meditating journaling I used to do daily
journaling like twice a day um stuff
like this that I don't really do anymore
and I I actually just ordered like um a
physical Journal yesterday uh going to
arrive tomorrow I guess or the day
Afters I'm going to restart that and
like it was a friend of mine actually
who recommended this journal it's not so
the journaling that I've done in the
past has has been like a gratitude
Journal where you write down like three
things you're grateful for three things
you're going to to to make this day
great whatever stuff like this this
journal that I ordered now was a bit
more deeper and a bit more
self-reflective and like
um like uh if your mom called you now
like what would you love to tell her
stuff like this a bit more deeper stuff
you know and like um yeah I don't know I
didn't look fully into it but it kind of
like I'm going to force myself to get
into a bit more of um the same habit
that I used to have in terms of this um
yeah taking a bit more care of my mental
health and also just like not start any
more projects as I mentioned before
because it's not only that you have
opportunities it's also uh when
something like this happens people want
stuff from you especially like it slowed
down a lot now of course but like the
first month the first six months after
winning the main there was a lot of
incoming right in terms of people who
want your attention for uh Media stuff
or investment stuff or people just want
people just asking you from money
straight up like I got so many messages
from people just like hey I'm going
through a tough
time my kid is sick I lost my job this
that whatever it is uh here's my account
number can you please transfer me 1K 5K
whatever there was a lot of stuff like
this and a a lot of these messages
are probably scammers who just come up
with so stories and like ask for money
some of these stories are probably
people genuinely
struggling um I found it really tough
actually
to most of it I kind of just
ignored sometimes you get messages from
like I'm from a small City in Norway you
know like 23,000 people or something
live there and I got some mess just
people asking from for money from people
in my hometown people that was like
common like I look on Facebook and like
we have six common friends you know like
my mom and my uncle and you know some
some stuff like this and I'm like
[ __ ] I don't know like a lot of this
stuff as well is really really hard to
decide actually like
what's yeah I don't know there's a lot
of challenges that I hadn't foreseen um
um that yeah came to the surface after
winning um that gave me both anxiety and
stress and all these things um yeah yeah
I feel anxious now just talking about it
honestly it's uh yeah it is what it is
um the yeah you help the people that you
um feel like you should help like family
friends and whatever and you can't help
everyone you can't answer every message
that you get and you can't even read
every message that you get get uh I
stopped reading these messages for a
while because it was very similar
pattern right they had lost everything
they were in very bad situation can you
please transfer me money and if you
every day like just turn through these
messages you're GNA go a bit crazy I
think you're not going to be able to be
happy so yeah yeah it's unforeseen
problems for sure in terms of like the
things that are pulling on your pulling
on your energy or pulling on your kind
of uh attention span and yeah it's one
of those things where at some point
you've got to shelter yourself you can't
take in information from everywhere you
can't take in people's requests and yeah
kind of bad situations and you're not
the sa yet to those so yeah I didn't
even foree those kind of issues and yeah
as you mentioned like just life became
more complicated it's like more going on
at the same time you're trying to
reinvent yourself decide what your next
chapter is you got opportunities but
also like the people asking you stuff of
you and now you must be in that stage
where you're like right I just want to
get clear on what I'm doing internally
there's obviously a lot of stress in the
system trying to figure figure out um
the big questions for yourself as well
as where to go so yeah really good job
on your part to uh hopefully come to the
side of that I know you're still working
through certain stuff but yeah sounds
like you're getting more to a better
place right now which want I want to
talk a little bit about mental health
overall because we on the topic in terms
of like being a pocket player especially
an online grinder it can be quite lonely
at times and you can feel pretty
isolated especially if you're grinding
alone I know you're in Vancouver now
with pads and you've had grind houses in
the past as well but you mentioned have
you ever experienced looniness in your
po carea or being online a lot grinding
have you ever felt a bit disconnected
from maybe your friends or life
overall yeah it's actually something
that I've thought more and more about in
the last couple of years as well and I
think I think I felt this a lot
especially in times of success like
winning big tournaments and you call
your mom you chat to a couple of your
friends who are there to celebrate with
you and then you look around and you
think [ __ ] like is this it you know like
is that it um
yeah
bit um yeah let's get a bit vulnerable I
guess yeah like so for the last couple
of years I've felt because I've been
single for quite some years now and
um that has maybe been like the biggest
part of my loneliness thing that I
haven't had a partner throughout these
years where I've been able to share the
ups and downs I think that's actually
something that I've neglected quite a
bit I because I was so focused on my
poker career and I was
like it's a really hard lifestyle for to
have a girlfriend in was what I felt
like at least because I was playing I
was living in Europe so I was playing
online till late at night I was
traveling a lot uh I was working a lot I
didn't have that much time to focus on a
partner so I felt like maybe that's just
not going to be a part of my life right
now maybe I'll just date um date
casually and like yeah fulfill my
intimacy needs through like shallow
relationships here and there and then um
kind of neglect like the whole deeper
relationship thing and I think it was
actually quite a big life leak and
something that
I yeah that I've been thinking a lot
about lately that I need to change and I
should probably devote more time and
energy into actually establishing like
some deeper more solid relationships
again because it
is quite a lonely life I would say if
you're just traveling from poker stop to
Poker stop and then between you're
grinding online and I have I'm
surrounded by people all the time you
know at these stops like I have friends
I have family I have like it's not like
I'm alone but I still feel quite lonely
at times just for not
having that someone like really close to
you that you can share these ups and
downs with I think it's something that
I've
actually yeah realized more and more the
value of in the last couple of years and
especially um especially in times of um
where things are going really well
winning big tournaments and you don't
have anyone to really share it with you
know it's yeah so I think that's
something that I'm going to be hopefully
working on over the next yeah yeah I
appreciate you sharing that it being
vable there with that cuz we all seek
deep connection whether it's with our
friends with the loved one and at times
we kind of prioritize our own goals and
what we're doing in life well we all do
to some degree we've got this in a in a
drive to pursue what we want but on some
point we get to we get to a point where
we want to experience things with other
people we want to have those if someone
to share the ups and downs with life I
think that's what you mentioned as well
like yes the Downs you want someone to
speak of sounds like for you probably
you're pretty good during the downs from
this conversation H but the UPS in
particular like that's where you want
people around you who you're super close
with you experience life with like if
you do everything I've run some thought
experiments if like it was just me on
the planet and no one else what would I
be doing with my days and like wow like
that's such a I don't even know because
nothing would be that great I would sit
and watch some sunsets i' would go
around walking around but I don't know
what I'd do because there's no one to
share it with then you put like five
people on the planet that I like I'm
like wow now this is going to be the
best thing of all time so it's like
understand like that people are really
importantance and it's certain phases as
well I don't think there's a a way to
look at like it's been a leak you said
maybe during that phase is going all in
a poker the way you did was the best way
to like get your life to where you want
to be and then from that Vantage Point
you're like oh now I'm here what's the
next kind of pH I want to share this
with more people obviously you're you're
in Vancouver with pads now you're
sharing with a good friends so I think
is trying to figure out like at each
stage what I need I'm sure a lot of
players struggle with this as well poker
players struggling with relationships
shout out to all the girlfriends and
wives of poker players it's a tough gig
to sign up for especially if you're
doing online and life like like you do
it must be challenging to uh meet those
demands either either joining the
traveling or waiting at home so yeah
hopefully going forward you can find
more balance I think that's the main
thing find that balance of time into
relationships and time into to to what
you're pursuing so final question I want
to ask on this these kind of topics is
around risk it feels like you're very
good at managing how much risk you take
in life overall talk us through like how
you've been able to uh kind of build
your mindset to calculate risk in a good
way because going from say the main
event it would have been very easy for
you to uh kind of blow off a lot of
money in big high roller cash games
massive TR high rollers which you have
played a lot and what makes you uh able
to uh make good decisions with your risk
management especially now you've kind of
you're in a situation where you could
easily take on more risk than you're
ready
for yeah I I think for me this comes
back to
um this circles back into the mental
health aspect of things right
where I have a lot of friends in poker
who love the risk they love the variance
they love spinning it back H spinning up
to Millions losing it all back spinning
it up again losing it back like they or
I don't know if they even love it but
they keep doing it for me that seems
like a nightmare I would not want to do
that you know I I don't like this
um like Yeah I'm kind of a like you
wouldn't think so since I lost like two3
of my net worth in crypto but I'm kind
of a knit when it comes to these things
like es like now at least um maybe that
has changed a bit but now like I I I
play all these tritons and whatever but
I usually sell a lot of action you know
I don't take massive variance in my life
anymore I don't feel like that's
particularly helpful especially now
since my mental state is already fragile
and I feel like my mind is a bit all
over the place and even just having this
convo now you know I feel like
I'm I I don't feel like I'm myself you
know I don't feel like I'm a relaxed
person who can like coherently talk
about these subjects I feel like I go on
these random Rants and my my mind is a
bit all over the place right now so uh
hopefully we can do a recap of this
podcast in a year or 18 months and maybe
I can be be a bit more coherent if I've
landed some stuff in my head but um yeah
no so I think like adding a lot of
variants on top of that and
taking yeah just I don't think it would
be good uh and I don't think it is good
for most people and their mental health
you know to
swing big chunks of your net worth every
month or yeah it does it just doesn't
seem like U I don't think we're built
for it I I think some people are more
built for it than others but in general
I don't think it's a particularly
healthy thing to do to
swing ludicrous amount of money like
every month you know it's yeah um so
yeah like early in my poker career as
well I was super knit with bankroll
management I said that's why I never had
like a losing month because I just I
would never like oh I'm GNA suddenly
start playing 2550 you know like I would
always like have like 100 or 200 binds
for every level before I moved up you
know and always following this system
and
yeah I'm a big knit in life in general I
would say and yeah with bankroll and
stuff as well pretty yeah nitty or
sensible however you want to look at
it yeah I think it's interesting with
you because you've got like kind of two
two sides of your kind of coin where on
one side you're really good at taking
risk in terms of if you lose a a large
chunk of money like the crypto stuff or
the the sh ticket empty T back in the
day it doesn't really affect you you're
quite resilient to risk and one one part
of taking risk is the ability to handle
the downside I feel like you're very
good at handling the downside but on the
other side as you mentioned it creates
so much stress like to put yourself at
risk you're literally putting yourself
in a yeah kind of very high stress
scenario on a frequent basis and for you
low and stress I think is a big part of
what you're trying to do as things are
get more complicated you're trying to
simplify more you're trying to yeah make
good choices but not add extra stresses
on and yeah I agree with you I always
almost I scratched my head a little bit
of the people who are consciously put
themselves at highrisk scenarios over
and over and over again and they come
out of it like over a few trials and
erors and I'm like oh now you've learned
your lesson and then boom back in next
high risk AV you I'm like okay here we
go again on the roller coaster but some
people like the thrill they like that
they like the high wins High loss
scenarios they live for that kind of
yeah that that kind of Lifestyle whereas
myself and I think you as well live more
for like that calmness that inner peace
is and that doesn't come from these kind
of high risk scenarios I'm interested on
you right now reny in terms of how your
approach to risk has of the years how
was your kind of risk tolerance coming
into your PO career and how's that
evolved for you over the years I think
it was naturally quite risk averse and
early on my poker career I went broke a
couple times and that did not help right
I only got even more risk ver I would
say some point I was just at a very bad
place was in a lot of makeup Dept uh
actually I was at I I was so bad at that
point that it actually helped because I
was like I can sit here worrying about
this but it's better to just let it go
and focus on what I have control over
and that's just trying to grind because
like also I I even considered like
quitting poker and then maybe paying it
back with a normal job but I was like
this is going to take me infinite amount
of years so I was like there's and I I
think I was doing sessions with Jared as
well at the time figured that you know I
was already down so much money I could
probably add some extra extra to the
bill and maybe it had a positive outcome
and there I think it really helped that
I would just let it go and be like
listen my life is sort of [ __ ] up
right now there's nothing I can do about
it so let's just start grinding and then
I grinded it back uh basically playing
mid Stakes because I touched higher
stakes and I kind of burned myself and I
remember for many I think that that
experience has cost me a lot of EV uh
and I would say even to this
day yeah I I wouldn't take on too much
risk I remember when I had my cfp or
when we started the cfp and started to
buy action it was actually had some
similar experience to what what asman
was talking about that suddenly you know
you made some money and it's like wow
what am I now going to do with this
money you know and invest in this this
opportunity comes around then you think
about it I was like oh you guys are
going to play this oh I guess I should
not B buy action because I have money
right and that's what people around you
do so you start buying action you have
no [ __ ] clue what you're doing and I
remember suddenly I lost like quite a
big part of my role as well but it was
not me playing and feel like especially
when you lose parts of your role because
you buy pieces and other people are
grinding with your action and stuff like
that uh it's no longer winning your
control like if I lose a lot in a
session at least then the next day when
I go I can take a break that day you
know because I don't want to few the
feeling of Los but when when you just
have action out and people are just
shooting and you have action it's no
longer every your control remember I had
to call Jared again because I was
freaking out a bit I think it was EP
Barcelona I believe and then there were
like the people I yeah Barcelona
normally great great time and I had some
money so I started investing and
everyone everyone kept on losing so so
that so that was not a uh yeah that was
not great but I feel like a lot of these
experience yeah I I feel like some
people can just take on more risk than
others some people stress out less than
others uh I'm a bit more risk verb
myself uh definitely always more like
steady EDD I think uh what esman always
like the hund buying for a stake and
then immediately selling action if I at
90 bons for example I was very very very
deliberate and then slowly grinding my
way up instead of taking shots uh don't
think it's the best way if you look at
what's the optimal way to grow your bank
roll uh so I would say it's probably a
leak but it's not a leak that if you
take a lot of risk and when you lose you
freak out because then so I don't know
to be honest I don't know what the
optimal the optimal risk is it's very
it's very dependent on on the individual
I say I guess I owe I owe you an apology
yeah Aspen because I I I have indeed
stalked you uh after after you won the
main event I was like hey we need to get
Aspen on the PO sounds like a good guy
and I also knew you already before that
right and you said I got overloaded with
messages so my apologies for overloading
you with messages over the years also my
apologies for starting out the podcast
say yeah you know you don't want to win
the main if have More Money More
Problems obviously it is sort of true
like I said I have experienced that as
well uh it's always a bit tough like
after Adam had a conversation like this
about topics that
are yeah I can I would almost say are
the most important to then switch to
other topics but usually it's my it's my
job as well to talk a little bit about
the technical stuff so I wanted to touch
on something that you mentioned um you
were living in a grind house was one of
the times that you enjoyed poker the
most right uh during Co with a couple of
Norwegian guys one guy named craps who
you mentioned that you learned a lot
from
a l of our audience is very motivated
but they usually lack ways or good
efficient ways how to study and I
remember you talked about hey these guys
you know they showed they showed me how
it is to get to the top in poker right
every day they would study what did you
learn from them and maybe we can touch
also specifically on like how did you
study to improve your
game yeah so the guy I mentioned is
prabs on Stars pre and.on is his name
hey it was one of the first guys in
um at least from I know uh from my
knowledge that started like really
working hard with Monker solver who was
like kind of a new software at that time
where people were uh trying to figure
out how to play pre flop Pio had been
out for some time and HRC had been out
for some time but uh moner was kind of a
tricky one because building Sims in
Monker wasn't easy it wasn't like
something that anyone could just like
hop in and start doing you know building
Sims and Pio bit more intuitive um also
takes some training to do it well but
Monker is like a different beast and PRS
was one of the first guys who like
actually worked a lot with Monker so he
had like pretty sophisticated pre- flop
strategies I would say compared to the
ones that I'd been playing before I'd
been using like charts
from I don't want to throw anyone under
the bus but one of the training sites
online you know like uh yeah they had
like charts you could like buy or
subscribe or whatever and these charts
were maybe not so sophisticated as the
as the charts that were coming out of
moners ss so learned a lot just from
like oh actually if you have Queen Jack
suited in the small blind May and cut
off has opened maybe you shouldn't
always just flat maybe this hand can do
some other things you know maybe you can
induce it even or go all in you know
like uh cuz in intuitively like a lot of
the strategies that people were playing
back then were pretty passive with a lot
of the suited Broadway suited Aces kind
of stuff it was pretty passive I would
say um but when these pre flop solvers
came like Monker people started to
understand that a lot of good things
actually happen when you shove Jack 10
suited in the B like if you can shove
Jack 10 suited and they will fold Ace
jack off Ace 10 off King 10 off King
jack off Queen jack off Queen 10 off if
they can fold like infinite combos that
dominates you plus a bunch of combos
that don't dominate you but that just
beat you and you can actually get folds
from these hands and not playing post
flop maybe that's better than just
taking a flop just because your hand is
pretty you know so it was kind of a
shift in strategies for mtts during this
time I feel like where um yeah people
started to understand that these pretty
hands are actually pretty good Allin
hands as well um yeah so I think my game
shifted a lot in that sense um prbs was
also playing way more aggressive than I
was I came from like a cash game like
kind of an old school cash game mindset
where um I was playing very uh if I had
a good hand I would like play strong
because people would just pay you off
back in the day like a lot of your EV
just came from making strong hands and
getting paid by the fish like you
wouldn't necessarily
um yeah at least that was never my
strategy like redlining a lot I was just
blue lining and making like infinite BB
per 100 just flopping sets and getting
paid by the fish that was like kind of
how you did it back then um so I had to
like kind of reshape my strategy towards
playing a bit more aggressive as well
and being a bit more um taking some
unintuitive Bluffs like no uh like zero
Equity Bluffs like yeah random tripling
off with like A3 suited on like uh Queen
10 a s stuff like this you know uh stuff
that wasn't very intuitive and had never
been part of my game before I started
seeing that um um preps and yeah some
other people but I'm going to give big
shout out to him because I feel like I
learned a lot from him during these Co
years um that he was playing like very
aggressive in a pretty different style
than what I was playing
so yeah um using Monker solver a lot and
P solver a lot and being in lockdown a
lot helped I would say quite a bit so
for the people who want to become good
poker player we have to wait for the
next pandemic
basically yeah or at least like make you
can pretend there's a pandemic you know
you can just decide that there's a
pandemic now I'm just going to stay
inside I'm not going to fomo into every
Liv stop and every I'm not going to
party during the weekends I'm not going
to do all these things you know you can
just decide that if poker is your
priority and you really want to go for
it you have to make some sacrifices and
some of these Liv stops they're very
tempting because you can go there and
play like a super soft 1K with like a
million up top
but there is expenses and there is time
cost and there is jet lag cost and there
is a lot of things that people don't
really consider with these Liv stops um
so for me the the pandemic was uh yeah
very good for this
but yeah um now it's a very different
climate as well right if you really want
to get super good you don't have
to rent some super computer server in
Germany and run like Monker Sims like
that costs infinite time and money to
build and run you can basically
subscribe to um GTA Wizard or any other
like online library right where you have
ICM Sims you have uh heads up SIMs you
have Sims for everything pre- flop post
flop
like back then it was so hard like to
study all these spots either you had to
buy Sim libraries which I think one of
the services we bought from I think it
was like 10K us for like a big Sim
package like a big pre-flop library from
Monker I think it was 10K us it was some
like ludicrous amount of money for the
Sim Library so you could either do that
or you could learn how to build the Sims
yourself spend like infinite hours and
rent supercomputers to actually run the
soles but it's not easy uh very timec
consuming very expensive now it's like
you subscribe you click true it's like
super quick super easy I don't know like
now it seems like um if you really like
I don't want to say it's easier now
because of course everyone has these
tools available so the game is much
tougher of course because everyone is
doing this now everyone who's trying has
access to these tools and
the the competition is just getting
tougher and tougher which is like yeah
of course always happening not only in
poker but in every sport in every game
um people's capabilities go up not down
so of course but um if you really want
to go for it now I yeah it seems like
yeah the options harder in the same time
easier and harder for sure um yeah so
how how do you think you know in the
past it was renting a super super
computer and having it Run infinite Sims
24 hours a day what is the best way to
gain an edge
nowadays I mean I'm going to be biased
here because I'm sponsored by GT wizard
we're also sponsored by GJ wizard so we
can make this a very biased podcast no
problem reminds me I should be wearing a
patch actually okay anyways we we'll do
that in post editing put a patch on M
post edit thing um yeah no I think like
using Solutions like this
where I I think there are different ways
like I I think there are like a few
different ways that you can really
improve your game I would say one is to
uh every time you're playing poker just
use Gazo or any like screenshot service
just screenshot a bunch of the hands
where you're unsure look them up in GTO
wizard after playing see if the computer
agrees with you or not um that's one way
to do it I think that's very good
because especially if you play like a
big spot yourself that spot is going to
be easier to remember and like the
solution is going to be easier to
remember because you have some emotional
attachment to the hand and the spot
right if it was like big Final Table
spot or whatever it's going to be quite
easy to remember that solution because
it means quite a bit to you
right uh second option is playing versus
a trainer just set up a spot that you
want to get better at lowjack versus cut
off single race P 30 big blinds just
play like infinite hands and look for
patterns establish like pattern
recognition for different spots try to
understand why the solver wants to check
range on this board and bet range on
that board and whatever uh look for
sizings what's the most frequent
sizings and um third is to watch footage
of great players watch Triton or a high
roller final tables online or um stuff
like that where you can see the whole
cards and you can actually see what
these uh very good players are doing and
if you disagree if you saw uh chidwick
make a play at the Triton 100K and you
think it's a bad play you can just go
into GTA wizard open a ICM same like
find a similar solution and see okay am
I stupid or am CH or is chidwick uh
stupid you know or yeah so I I think
like there's different ways to set game
now and I think like using all of these
ways is probably um necessary to become
very good
I I think like they all have their um
yeah advantages and
disadvantages um
yeah it's easy to get overwhelmed
because poker is so complex how do you
like I agree with with everything you
just said they're all very valuable
tools how does one prioritize what to
study yeah you may you mentioned for
example you can open up a drill CER side
certain spot how do you
determine what is most important and do
you have any ADV advice for our
audience usually for me it's just like
if I if I repetitively find myself in a
spot in game where I'm like I have no
clue what to do here like I have
absolutely no clue what to do um I
usually make a note of that that's just
like reminder like I write a note
remember to study this spot um and then
just I go drill it for x amount of hands
till I feel more confident about the
spot right um I think that's probably
the best way to do it because it's not
like one thing that people should study
it's different like some people are
really good at heads up some people are
really good short-handed some people are
really good with ICM some people are
really bad at like close to Bubble
scenarios for me for example I feel like
one of my weaknesses right now is
playing uh bubble scenarios or getting
close to the bubble like how how uh Agro
can I be as chip leader how passive do I
need to be as mid stack how careful do I
need to be as short stack you know stuff
like this where uh I'm feeling a bit
insecure about these spots so I'm going
to spend like the next um study session
is like looking a bit more into these
spots but that's different from person
to person right like what are you good
at what are you bad at and just being
um vulnerable and like just being like
uh honest with yourself that like you
don't know every spot because no one
does uh maybe Makita but outside of him
no one does so just being honest about
that and like
finding yeah um finding the spots where
you're weak and drilling those what do
you think are your strengths
probably the emotional disconnect that I
spoke about earlier that I don't really
get flustered I don't get tilted I don't
um yeah I'm not emotionally attached
like I can be like I can be emotionally
attached if I [ __ ] up a hand like if I'm
in a big final table and I I do
something stupid or whatever I can be
like disappointed but I
never like yeah I'm never like very
emotional you know I never slam the
keyboard and like curse or like yeah
it's going to be fine and basically this
allows you to this basically allows you
to access the poker theoretical
knowledge that you have to like at a
high frequency of course of course like
I If your brain is going to go into like
hyperdrive like stressing about like uh
the bad beat that you just took or
whatever it is you know like uh
something that you remember that you
have to do like this email that you have
to reply to or whatever this fly is
driving me crazy um if you're going to
let your brain like uh mess with you
when you're playing because you have all
these other things like right now I have
a lot of stuff on my mind but when I'm
playing poker I still feel like I can be
disconnected from these things and like
focus on the game so I think that's
probably like a big thing you do
anything like recession to
do you like remind yourself the points
that you're focus on or do you kind of
say like okay these are the things that
are in my mind are my to-do list let me
park those I remember I used to do
actually a lot of visualizing before my
session and I think it was Elliot Row in
one of his visualizations where he he
made you imagine a safe and you would
open the safe and you would put the
stuff in that was in your head and then
you would close the safe and you would
look at them later but during right now
you're gonna play poker and actually for
me personally I'm very visual person
like visualization really works a lot
for me uh for me that really helped do
you have any any way of like when
especially when you have a lot of stuff
in your head but hey scoop scoop doesn't
care that you have a lot of stuff in
your head it's going to start right now
how do you how how do you best
prepare uh no I don't have a safe where
I put my stuff that sounds like a cool
technique though no I just um I usually
just have to-do lists I guess it's like
kind of a safe where I put everything
that's on my mind in to-do lists like I
set this I need to do on this date and
that date reply to this email uh
transfer this money whatever it is you
know like do these things and I have it
in a to-do list so I don't have them
like circulating in my head and as long
as I have them I can like Park them in
my to-do list and then focus on what I
need to do I think that's been like a
big help for me to do lists for
sure many players uh I mean you you
talked a lot about uh GTO obviously
exploitation very big part of the game
many players now they struggle to find
like the balance between GTO and
exploitive play how do you navigate the
balance between implementing GTO play
while staying in the lookout for
possible exploits on your
opponents I would say I'm not maybe the
right guy to ask I'm not very good at it
I would say I yeah uh in terms of
strengths in my game this is probably
one of my weaknesses in my game I would
say that I'm not like constantly on the
lookout for exploit and stuff like that
it used to be a much bigger part of my
game I would say uh well naturally
before solvers when I was playing heads
up it was all about exploting right you
were just like trying to figure out what
was he doing and try to come up with
counter strategies um now I've been like
I would say I've been a bit too GTO
oriented probably
um in a lot of spots so I I think that's
going to be maybe my main
focus maybe not so much for scoop Maybe
try to play kind of theoretical during
scoop but especially for dou sop where
I'm going after scoop it's a big thing
right like actually paying attention to
what's going on there and how can we
exploit these people it's a big big
thing right and it's also much easier
live I would say than online especially
if you're playing a lot of tables it's
not so easy to uh come up with these
clever exploits while if you're playing
at a live game and you have a lot of
time to figure people out and um think
about counter strategies it's a bit
easier for me at least um but yeah I I
wouldn't say I'm a good person to ask
about this it's not really a strength of
mine I would say well let me ask you a
question that I'm sure is uh is up your
street
uh playing poker a lot is is very
demanding on on the body right we do a
lot of sitting I know you're very back
into exercise Health you have any
exercise tips for poker players to make
sitting on a chair bit less detrimental
for your body or a bit more comfortable
I
guess um well I'm like that weird guy
when I play live poker that stands up a
lot I do a lot of stretching next to the
table walk around for a bit you know
like move around just like not sit for
two hours straight uh between breaks and
then like walk in the braks okay but
like sitting for two hours straight like
every I don't think that's particularly
good um in general I would say just like
cheat code to healthier body is walking
more in general being outside and
walking I'm a big proponent big fan of
that
um in terms of what exercises to do of
course like there are bunch of exercises
that you can just like desk sitting
exercises that you can Google stuff that
you can do in while you're sitting or in
five minute breaks like um stuff that
opens up like your shoulders or your
lower body or whatever there's like easy
stuff you can do to uh negate the fact
that you are sitting that much um of
course I think like the best option is
to not always sit when you're playing as
well if you have like a standing desk or
a threadmill desk or anything like this
and like actually vary the position that
you're in like sit for an hour stand for
two hours sit for an hour stuff like
this is very helpful um I don't have
that now because we're in Airbnb and
there's Limited
Uh custom
customizability uh I don't really want
to yeah spend too much time in investing
in like a setup for a place where I'm
going to be for one month um you do have
a nice chair did you did did did did you
buy that online or was it already there
this one actually I I bought one um this
is actually a chair that Landon TI
brought over yesterday he bought like a
bunch of monitors and chairs because
there was like another group group of
poker players here in Vancouver that
were moving and they had like a bunch of
chairs and monitors that they were just
offloading because they were leaving so
we got kind of like a bulk discount deal
for that but uh it's not a particularly
nice one it's an okay one it's not no
but I I I can guess like you're
currently in uh in in Vancouver to play
the scoop I can imagine that if you're
going to sit there for a month that at
least you know you would go online and
buy at least a decent chair like I
understand that you're not GNA buy a
standing desk right yeah yeah I like if
I buy an office setup for myself at home
now like uh I am just about to do that
to set up a new office there I will of
course have like standing desk and
Herman Miller iron which is my favorite
chair like an actually good office chair
and an actually good desk orgonomic
setup I think it's like super important
like actually thinking about the height
of your monitor and like all of these
small things um yeah I love geeking out
on that [ __ ] so I also saw I think it
was on your Instagram you're were also
excited to geek out on your bedroom
right yeah that that's like the most
tilting part when you live in airbnbs
all the time actually now I've been
homeless for 14 months I've just been
traveling from hotel to Airbnb to hotel
to Airbnb which also probably hasn't
helped with my stress levels and anxiety
levels at all I would think that's like
part of it as well that you're like
always you know that next week you have
to uh pack your [ __ ] and go to a new
place you have to book flight tickets
apply for a v uh like all these things
always um yeah I think that's like
pretty toxic way to live to be fair so I
I I can't wait now to not be homeless
anymore
um yeah what was I answering I because
for for maybe to give us some I saw on
on Instagram you bought a place in Dubai
if I'm not mistaken that you were going
to spend spend some time in and I
remember I saw specifically one post
where you really want to geek out on
your bedroom like I'm going to optimize
temperature the most comfy bed in the
world yeah yeah because like all yeah
that's where we were right so at all
these airbnbs there's always something
like either the air conditioner doesn't
work or there's like construction work
outside like there is here now you wake
up like 600 7 in the morning and it's
like hammering they're like destroying a
bridge right outside of where we live um
there's always like sunlight coming in
because the curtains are dog [ __ ]
there's always like something like this
you know that's tilting when you're
traveling so just having those things in
place as well having those things in
place and an ergonomic setup for
studying playing all these
things can't wait yeah I I I can imagine
I I've I've done a little bit of
traveling earlier on my career as well
uh yeah it definitely was a very
stressful time for for also the things
that you describing or internet was [ __ ]
and I was tilting because of that also I
had Financial like like I explained
earlier I was not in a great financial
situation spending money everything was
expensive oh no and I had such a high
need to kind of settle down and I
remember once I finally settled down
that's also when I grinded everything
back right uh just like every day have a
routine you know oh yeah no I I I can
definitely feel you man I'm sure it's
going to be uh it's going to be it's
going to help help a lot any any you
have been homeless you set for 14 months
traveling a lot any travel hacks for for
the for the audience and maybe also do
you have maybe jetl hacks that would
maybe also come in handy so travel hacks
jetl
hacks not really and not really like the
like I do optimize some things uh for
traveling in terms of jetlag and stuff
but I don't really use melatonin I know
a lot of people are fan of fans of that
to kind of like um yeah force yourself
to sleep when you arrive in a time zone
where you're not used to sleeping but
I'm more bullish on just trying to
adjust your time zone before you leave
if it's possible to like adjust your
sleep schedule so you will like move
towards the sleep schedule you want to
be in in the place you're going to be
arriving like a week before you go or
something like that if you have the
option to do that not always you can of
course do that but yeah I think that's a
better option than using melatonin or
stuff like that for me personally at
least um for travel hacks in
general I don't know the hack is to
travel less I would say I'm just so over
it right

and maybe you will get a chance to work
with me and Adam and make more progress
in your poker career but for now without
further ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode yeah Adam I
know you live in Bali it's not in a very
easy place uh to travel to other places
I think any flight is for example a
flight you're origin from the UK how
long do it take to get to the UK like 20
hour flight or something 18 hours on a
good flight 20 hours on average and yeah
I live quite probably three hours away
from the nearest of the places which
would be Singapore qual Lumpa and
Australia and yeah I agree with espen's
travel hack of Trel less if you want to
kind of feel good I mean this trade-offs
obviously traveling is amazing seeing
new places and you want to get that kind
of blend right for yourself uh but you
sacrifice routine you sacrifice feeling
good on your schedule you sacrific home
comfort of just waking up in the same
bed and things that most people would
take for granted so yeah I haven't done
any of like long traveling I do like
little travel breaks every six weeks
every two months I go somewhere new but
I haven't like kind of lived in a yeah
kind over suitcase so to speak so I
can't really relate to uh the stresses
you guys are experiencing all I can
think of is that would be stressful for
me if I was constantly on the go and
then I think it's just trying to find
routine so actually a good question to
ask you Espin is how do you find
routines when you come to a new place
because if you're traveling all the time
my initial thought would be okay I want
to I want to get on get on schedule get
on a morning routine but that's changing
all the time based on the time zone
whether you're playing live whether
you're playing online what are some of
the things you prioritize when you go to
a new place and the things that are
important for your your routine overall
yeah I mean routine is such a big thing
if you're going to thrive in any
environment I think like being in a good
routine usually when I get to a new
place I try to find like where is the
nearest gym that I can use like a good
gym uh where is the nearest place I can
get healthy food um I buy like uh some
basic stuff that I can have um to get my
protein needs met and get my yeah like
when we came to Vancouver for example we
found like a really nice salad place
that's close to here we go there every
day buy a couple of salads so we have
that um I make overnight oats at home so
I have that ready always in the fridge
uh bought like protein powder and all of
that so I have that ready protein bars
just try to optimize everything so you
have healthy options available
um yeah and like as soon as you get
there try to force yourself to wake up
at the hour that you want to be waking
up so you like get into the right sleep
schedule ahead of time like scoop starts
in two days um it's third of May today
when we're recording so scoop is about
to start being in a good sleep schedule
for that so I'm ready to wake up to play
Scoops I don't have to like the first
four days of scoop waking up like jet
lagged tired uh this is why I came here
as early as I did as well to get into
routine before uh an important event
like scoop starts you know um so it's
just like a bit of plan and a bit
of um yeah I don't really have any big
hacks just try to try to find like
healthy stuff near to you I think like
yeah I'm glad I'm not the only person
who prioritizes find the gym every time
I go travel in I always go where's the
gym and I'm always like trying to find a
a sweet spot where I can find a nice
hotel um near a decent gym uh but yeah I
think it's important just to just get
the normal things going like in in line
with the SEC Rhythm Good Foods somewhere
to exercise just tring to create a nice
rhythm in an environment where
everything's new and I think some people
struggle when they lose their normal
routine to create a new one like they'll
go traveling and they'll just throw
everything out the window and kind of
freestyle it where other people people
like yourself are very professional
understand wherever you are routin is
important let's do the basic things well
let's find some good restaurants or good
cafes where I can go to for food and
yeah all those kind of things yeah it
sounds like you've you do enough job of
a good job on that one so I want to
transition now into doing some
reflecting on your PO career and there's
a great great quote by Jim Cary that
says I wish everyone would get rich and
famous and do everything they ever
dreamed of so they can see that's not
the answer and for you I think you may
have experienced this yourself and I
want to ask you what is your definition
of
success yeah tough one tough one for
sure I guess success is when
you're happy content
thriving
[Music]
um yeah it's going to be different for
so many people and it's been different
for me so many times throughout my life
right what is success like at some point
success was losing weight at some point
success was finishing my Master's Degree
win a big
tournament
uh yeah help my family out it's been a
lot of different things and I don't
think there's one answer it depends on
your situation but for me right now like
the thing like the next big goal for me
and the success for me would be
to um be happier and healthier Health
would be a big thing for me now like I
know you're a big guy into this uh I
like I I follow you on Instagram and you
post like a lot of workout content and
you're really hard on the gym grind uh
I've been less hard on the gym grind
lately because because of this episode
that I had in Bali after that I was
struggling to go to the gym the doctors
told me to not go to the gym for a while
and uh I I know you're tracking Health
metrics as well I think you're using the
same thing as me like a whoop
band yeah so I'm tracking everything in
whoop and I see my health metrics are
still screwed after that b episode and
that is now two and a half months ago
almost my resting heart rate right
before that episode was like 40 42
around there now it's 55 up to 60 so
quite a lot higher my HRV was like above
100 like peaked at like 117 or something
like that now it's consistently like 30
maybe 40 so I don't know something's
going on my body is not um yeah too
happy with what I'm doing right now so
success for me now would be to get back
to where I was in terms of health
happiness um stress levels anxiety
levels all of this just feel better in
my own skin again
feel yeah feel better like I just don't
feel that good right now and it's yeah
it's really yeah not a good place
answer yeah I really like the answer
there because it went kind of deep into
uh kind of all the facets of being a
human and trying to live a good life and
I think a lot of us is in early life in
particular link success to achievement
if someone asked me in my 20s what
success was I'd tell them all the things
I wanted to achieve and that was success
and then you start having some
achievements and you're like uh yeah
nice but that's not really if I've got
load of outward success but I'm not
internally happy is that success and you
very quickly go it's not or happiness
starts to overtake achievements and then
Health if Health gets sacrificed at any
moment or you get sick or you can't do
what you want in life you very quickly
go Health actually goes pretty close to
the top of if not at the top as well so
you end up like a hierarchy of happiness
and health right at the top then
achievements come like somewhere
underneath and I think it's obviously
we're complicated people on this planet
trying to do many things at once but I
think when you come to that realization
okay I want to be happy want to be
healthy other things I'm doing in
alignment or move me towards that I
think we can't get to uh kind of
perfectionist based we need to realize
we're making steps but not perfect steps
and am I am I trending towards being
more happy and be more healthy that's
kind of what I kind of do in my life I I
trending towards a happier healthy
version of myself over time if answer is
yes where can I improve and yeah for
your health metrics they're very extreme
changes so if anyone who tracks their
rest in heart rate or HRV you'll see
generally they drop sorry heart rate
drops when you're under stress or
fatigued the heart rate Rises sorry in
HIV drops so yours are very significant
because heart rate generally doesn't
change too much so my heart rate is
generally around 48 50 it doesn't change
unless I get Co some extreme your Chang
is like really extreme like 15 so what
that generally represents is either
overtraining if you if you're kind of
doing a lot of physical stuff but often
like stressing the system and kind of
being stuck on that kind of H
sympathetic mode which is generally very
activated it doesn't NE necessarily need
to be uh that you're doing stuff but
like internal like in the body there's a
very good book called the body keeps
score which kind of goes into trauma but
it also goes into stress and it talks
about like you can't cheat the body the
body is always noting what stresses are
going on in your environment and if it's
Flag some things as these are important
stressful and it's hold n to those your
health metrics will kind of suff far as
a result so yeah you also are pretty
extreme so yeah very interested to hear
how that changes over time obviously
there's going to be some correct thing
to do in terms of Lifestyle stuff maybe
getting into a stable routine in a in
Dubai your your new place could help to
uh get that Comfort maybe your body's
feels a little bit on edge right now and
that's why you're experiencing not quite
feeling your best right now but yeah
super interesting I think anyone would
benefit from doing some sort of tracking
of their their health metrics just to uh
gain self-awareness on what your
Baseline looks like and then when things
change how that how that affects it so
for you have you noticed since that
event in Bley have you noticed your
day-to-day experience been any different
like do you feel different in your body
since then any kind of physical changes
you've noticed as a result of that yeah
I feel different for sure I
feel I feel worse I just I feel I just
feel worse um I feel like my pulse is
more erratic some heart arhythmia I
guess like my pulse sometimes just goes
very high and then it comes back down uh
maybe especially when I'm working out
especially some
exercises um that some somehow affects
it a lot maybe it disrupts my breathing
in some way where it's stresses my heart
or whatever so I have some breathing
stuff that's going on um and all of this
maybe gives me some anxiety as well like
feeling that maybe I'm not okay um I
removed quite a bit of that anxiety
because I I went to doctors in Bali when
I was there I went in South Korea when I
was there last month now did like all
the checks that you could do like uh EKG
and like a 24hour monitor and I did like
stress test and I did like scanned it
like x-ray thing did everything
everything came back clean so I should
be fine I think it's honestly I think
it's mental and I think my body is just
signaling
that that I need to slow down a little
bit or yeah not um yeah yeah yeah I
think right I the main thing is get
everything checked out so you feel that
peace of mind and also that there isn't
any underlying health issue and yeah
over time you'll make the correct Ms to
your routines and your overall stress to
kind of lower those those things yeah
hopefully it's trending in the right
direction over time and yeah it sounds
like you're being more mindful of it
which I think will will also help so I'm
want to transition to a few questions on
looking back on your career and what do
you think is the one thing you would
have wanted to know about poker when you
start started out so you had two starts
you started in 2004 and you start again
in 2017 start out maybe on both those
Journeys what do you wish you hadn't
known
soona well for the first one I would say
I wish I would have known how hard it
was going to get how privileged we were
be to be in that spot to play these
incredibly soft games uh that early on
and be a bit more uh mature to take
advantage of it that would be the first
thing uh when I came back to poker in
2017 what I wish I knew then
um good question honestly I I I was so
lucky in that spot because I was
surrounded by very good people who
guided me uh I just watched uh your pod
with European um over the last couple of
days here and I think that one was um
also a lot of stuff that really like SP
spoke to me in a sense where he said
what helped him the most in his career
was um the people that he was surrounded
with and that is 100% the case for me as
well like a lot of My Success is just
due to my network and how um I've been
surrounded by really good people and
learned a lot from them and gotten a lot
of both knowledge and motivation from
the people that I've surrounded myself
with so in terms of what I wish I knew
um
I don't have a good one for this in 2017
honestly because I feel like
I I I I don't think I would change much
honestly from the path that I did maybe
um have a bit more balance but again if
I had the balance I wouldn't be where I
am right now so maybe I didn't need
balance maybe I needed to be on this
kind of selfish Journey where I was
focusing on myself and poker and I don't
know it's hard to look back at these
things and say how I should have done
that differently because everything
would be different right and yeah no I'm
quite I'm quite happy with the the
journey that I went on for the last few
years um I wouldn't change anything
really yeah I love that and I think
sometimes we'll get to an end point and
you can look back and once you look back
you realize everything can head to
happen in the way it did to get to where
you are so it's kind of a trick question
to go what would you kind of change
because you change something everything
kind of SC in a different direction but
it's one of those things where you can
also go if I wanted to get to where I am
quicker what would I have done
differently on that path for you like
from 2017 things went really well in
terms of how you applied yourself so the
lesson probably was I'm on the right
path it's going to get good over time
just commit to the path sort of thing so
yeah maybe there wasn't anything major
on that path all right the next question
is what's one thing your put careers
brought you that you didn't expect it to
start now
well outside of the financial position
that I am now which is better than I
would have could have hoped for of
course
um yeah I don't know
like also very hard one to answer like
I'm obviously in like a way better
financial position that I than I hoped
for or that I was planning to be in like
tournament poker is very random like
this suddenly it is win a big tournament
for infinite buyin at the top of your
buying level and yeah it's just so
Random right uh so there is not really I
don't think there goes much planning
into that
um like before the main event I had
um yeah it was more like a steady grind
you know I had like some big tournament
scores but nothing remotely close to the
main event um win so I don't know
tournament booger is random trying to
anything in tournament poker is kind of
futile I think like there's a lot of
players that are way better than me at
poker that has had that have had way
less success you know and that's just
how tournament poker works there are
some people that are just at the top of
the variance curve who's going to
outperform almost everyone because they
they're just at the top of that curve
right and there's people that are
working super hard that are super good
at poker that just never has that
breakthrough that are just like in
makeup up forever worst case scenario
just in makeup forever it happens right
it's crazy like recommend everyone go
read full by Randomness by Nasim TB like
that book is very good
at explaining what I'm trying to explain
now very incoherently about this game
we're playing where people think people
attribute a lot to hard work and
intelligence or skill or Talent or
whatever people attribute a lot to that
and in the end there's a lot of
Randomness and yeah you just have to be
grateful that you're um for me for
example I just have to be humble and
grateful to be where I am right now and
realize that it's not because I'm so
much [ __ ] smarter or that I work so
much harder than these other guys is
probably just I was yeah uh lucky enough
to be around really good people lucky
enough to win those five last important
coin flips in a man event lucky enough
to whatever you know it's yeah it's so
yeah a lot of luck in this world and
yeah I guess poker has made me realize
that to a very high degree than yeah
before that's a good one that's a good
one how much luck plays a role in
success it's interesting I remember
listening to Tim for Tim FIS getting
interviewed and he had the number one
podcast at that time and they said oh
how have you built the biggest podcast
in the business space this time and he
said I got lucky and I was like got
lucky I was like he's really good at
what he does and his first response was
got got lucky right place right time
might right people and I think like we
don't understand like how much like
circumstances are very fortunate favor
or malleable and lots of things need to
happen for an event to unfold but on the
flip side you've got to meet kind of
luck halfway you've got to always put
yourself in the situations always put
the work and take action so it goes back
to that kind of manifestation question
or topic we had earlier where thinking
about having having something or
thinking about creating something is
only a piece of the puzzle same with
look only piece of the puzzle so you've
also got to take the actions to put
yourself in those situations so people
who take a lot of action get very lucky
people who are good at what they do get
very lucky why is it they're always in
situations where kind of luck can fa
them to some degree on the flip side as
you mentioned Don't Get Fooled by
Randomness there's a lot of luck
involved if you're the guy who's on the
top end of the variance curve and you
got all success then yeah you've got to
factor in that look was in your favor
and yeah it's going to happen in all
avenues obviously mtts is the the
biggest kind of Poker format to uh to
sure that that is the case other formats
have less of a kind of look factor in
them mtts have a massive one but yeah I
think it's a really good one yeah fed by
Randomness I really enjoyed that book to
uh kind of dispel um connotations of
what what skill is and yeah basically
not glorifying the people at the top of
the the kind of pyramid so to speak
because a lot of factors go into that
which are kind of out of your control
all right final question from me is what
was the most enjoyable period of your PO
career and what made it so much
fun um
I guess I have a couple of one that's
couple of ones that stand out um I think
my big my first like big is online score
was very memorable um I I won like a 5k
WPT online it was like it wasn't like
even a Big Field it was like 200 entry
field but um I won it for like 200k um
but I want it during Co living in a
Grindhouse and had some friends visiting
as well so it was like a very and
everyone in the house had action in my
tournament so it was like a very big
group feeling you know like everyone was
celebrating we were out in the garden
after the tournament smoking cigars
drinking whiskey like we had like a big
campfire it was like it was like a sick
sick evening and like I remember the
feelings just how happy like relaxed
happy it was just like one of the best
feelings ever um that one stands out
very
memorable uh winning the tag team event
in Vegas with pads uh very memorable um
I would maybe even say that was I don't
want to say it was more memorable than
winning the main event but the main
event win was almost a bit too much in a
sense where it was overwhelming you know
like you couldn't really uh maybe
comprehend it fully or like there was so
much going on like media attention and
like all these things you know like your
head is kind
of everywhere while after the tag team
event it was like oh it wasn't even it
wasn't life-changing money you know like
it was like a $500 buyings we won like
70k each or whatever but the feeling
after that tournament was like very
profound and like very enjoyable moments
to win it with a good friend you know
and like I don't know that was fun um so
I guess those
two those two ones in poker are like the
ones that stand out I guess yeah it goes
back to how much we enjoy being
connected with the people so for you
like you had the personal success of the
main event but you had the kind of one
where you won the tour with all your
friends while involved in your action
that felt like more connected more
better the same with the B with pads
there's a an element of sharing success
that's kind of underrated there like
some say it's Lonely at the Top it can
be Lonely at the Top like when you're
climbing Pursuits but also like if
you've got the people around you to
share the experiences that's going to
make a big difference on how success
feels for you as you arrive there I
think for you you've had a very uh kind
of rounded experience of both both
extremes of what it's like to uh be the
top of the mountain by yourself and also
with other people and yeah really really
interesting to hear you speak about
those experiences all right over to you
reny what's been some happy moments in
your career any kind of Peck moments
where you felt like this is what poker
is all about this is the kind of the
dream the dream I'm meant to be
living I would say
it's like obviously I don't play
tournaments so I don't have like one
moment that I can stand out like that so
I would just say the when I was trying
to get to the top and I was uh I was
sharing an office with some other guys
and we were all like every day trying to
get better get better and try to get to
the top and then eventually you know we
did arrive not at the top right line is
just too good uh but you know we we
arrived at the top segment and then just
that that journey and like that
excitement for the game and being being
that busy with like strategies and
trying to exploit your opponents finding
leagues going into the games exploiting
those Leakes going back to the lab back
to the game just that whole process day
and day out I would say just that grind
I would say that's the most that that's
my most enjoyable experience in poker
and that's actually something that I
struggle with nowadays because I have
multiple things going on I cannot get
like I still play some poker but it's
not it's almost like torture for me I
would say basically I'm torturing Myself
by playing a littleit with a poker
because it's like I don't get it's
almost like I cannot win because if I
win a session or if I play I'm like yeah
okay but then when I lose a session or
when I make mistakes I'm like [ __ ] this
is where I want to go fully into it but
then you know you have other things
going on other commitments so I would
say yeah if poker for me is most
enjoyable when you're really trying to
get good at it I would say that's that
that's when it's most most enjoyable for
me um for sure I I agree completely with
this like the journey is the whole thing
that's why I enjoyed the co years so
much as well we were just like we were
there you know like in the trenches
grinding like in the solver every day
you know like that journey is big and
yeah and I guess also like the sharing
right you were there with with you were
not doing it alone I was not doing it
alone I I had like my partners in crime
sort of right we were talking strategy
every day and and nowadays also when I
do strategy it's a bit more lonely
obviously I still do calls with people
maybe online but it's not the same that
if every day you know you walk into the
office and then you you're excited for a
guy to walk in because you found
something you want to show him you know
like yeah you arrived look look look
look look come come look at this look at
this this is exactly that exploit that
we talked about look ah he fell for it
that that like just that is amazing like
being being we working on a project like
that um I wanted to actually ask ask you
something um I wanted to know yeah you
were you were talking about they canot
in a in a great place did you now
obviously scoop WSOP is is around the
corner big events but did you
consider skipping them and if I mean
apparently not what made you decide on
on on not to skip
them I it entered my um consciousness
briefly uh but then I thought back to
scoop last year I was living with pads
here in Vancouver last year as well and
it was like insanely good month I just
loved it like the whole um cuz it's like
a team aspect you know like we wake up
every day we go to war at the tables
after a grind we go for a walk we go eat
dinner we talk about hands like this
whole thing I I [ __ ] love it I
couldn't uh couldn't miss it so this
month was off the table to skip uh for
sure
uh Vegas is a bit
more yeah I'll see how I feel in Vegas I
I've booked like the whole summer I'm
going to be there and Grind All Summer
but if in the middle of it I feel like
you know what I'm kind of over it I will
fly out I'll do something else um but
yeah we'll see I don't know like I I'm
kind
of at least for these two stops it's
quite long periods in one place I'm
spending six weeks in Vancouver six
weeks in Vegas that gives me time to
unpack my [ __ ] to set up my computer
with like a nice Monitor and like to
unpack and get into a routine the worst
is if like when you're like before I
came here I was in um so I was traveling
in Asia all this year I was in January
in puket February in Bali uh March in
Korea so I was in jedu then I went to se
for a little bit then to jedu again then
I went to Tokyo for three days then I
flew from Tokyo
to Norway then from Norway I was going
to go to Dubai Dubai was shut down
because the airport was flooded there
was like a big uh flood in Dubai
happening so I couldn't go there ended
up flying here instead so it's just like
a bit bit too much you know like always
flying always never unpacking you know
yeah it's just too messy now at least
I'm in some one place for a bit extended
time you know and that's that feels good
um also just putting in these long
grinds it suits me kind of well I'm like
a routine kind of guy I don't like
shifting things up too much and going
from place to place I yeah which is
incredible that I've chosen to be
homeless for the last 15 months since I
don't really enjoy it at all I don't
know how I came to the conclusion that
that was a good idea but I was like I'm
traveling so much anyways why do I want
to pay like 4K us per month in rent in
London for this small apartment when I'm
never there anyways you know I I might
as well just cancel that and like just
live everywhere but yeah was a very bad
decision I think it's important to have
a base so you can have some place where
you can unpack your [ __ ] and like
actually was it maybe also like some
sort of a fantasy I think you earlier in
the conversation you also talked about
fomo right looking at the live
tournaments was it maybe Al like a
little bit of fomo like oh wow now I B
and I can play all these high rers was
it maybe like you kind of looked at this
life and imagined it was like more
amazing than it actually was because
apparently it's not necessarily suited
for you because you're so R routine
oriented yeah yeah it's always a
struggle back and forth there if I
should play more online be in one place
or if I should go to all these poker
stops yeah I I enjoy both honestly I
enjoy both as long as there's balance
and it's not too much um I wouldn't only
want to play online and be in one place
but I also wouldn't want to be doing
what I'm doing right now so I just need
to find like the middle um yeah because
I I really love doing what I'm doing I
love playing poker I love traveling just
not as much as I'm doing right
now we talked a little bit about
um the the the the lock factor in poker
now actually very often actually kind of
the advice is no you're blaming lock
while it's actually you are not skilled
how can one as objectively as possible
observe the lock Factor involved in
their results both positive and negative
and how can one become better at
that I mean it's very hard right you can
of course do stuff to make sure that
you're not just getting lucky you can
review your game you can hire a coach to
look over your game you can compare your
uh you can record your session and
compare your stuff that you're doing to
a solver you can do stuff to make sure
that you're not not just getting lucky
right but it's hard to say like how
lucky are you getting like because you
can't you can't even just look at like
your bb per 100 or your Roi or whatever
like if you have like massive massive
samples it works to some degree but
especially like it's better for cash
games obviously than tournaments right
because even in tournaments
like you can have a positive BB per 100
but you're like clueless with ICM you're
going to struggle and I don't know
there's yeah I don't know it's hard to
hard to review that stuff um I kind of
just think you have to um accept that
it's a big part of the game and just
focus on the stuff that you can control
which is how good you're playing how
well rested you are going into every
session how mentally and physically
prepared you are all of that stuff
control that stuff and just accept that
luck is a big big big part of what we're
doing especially MTT brags um and yeah
just take the take the precautions that
you can because you know this luck is so
big like swap with friends for big
tournaments sell action if you're
playing too big uh
don't don't force force the action too
much and hope for that one big Bank you
know it's cuz it might not never come
that's the that's the sad part like you
might just never have that breakout
score which is crazy
yeah I I feel like when things are not
going well kind of go through like sort
of a checklist while at least you know
at least and everything that's under my
control at least I'm doing that well I
think you gave some good tips right you
can send over all especially if you play
online send over all your data have a
coach look at your game um I think that
these are all are are all definitely
very valuable uh valuable pieces of
advice what is the one
thing that you struggle the most or that
is the most Difficult about being a
poker
player um for me or for most poker
people because I think that's different
I think two answers is
fine I think for most people the most
difficult part is that you might go to
work every day for a year and end up
with a negative salary at the end of the
year um just the variance of the game
can be like brutal and really crushing
for some people uh for me I either
because of my resilience or because I've
been fortunate to not have too much of
the bad variant in my poker career uh
that's not been a problem for me I would
say the problem for me has
um I guess the biggest problem for me
was strategically getting rid of my old
patterns when I came back into poker
after being out of Poker for a while
because I had a lot of uh and I still
have some of these things that are so
ingrained in my game that I think it
would almost be easier coming from
scratch and starting working with
solvers knowing nothing and just
grinding solvers uh than trying to get
rid of bad patterns that I had in my
game from 2007 you know like all these
like super nitty Behavior where just
like yeah very blue line oriented poker
I think it's easier if you start from
scratch to become like a good Red Line
player and just play a very good out of
line poker um compared to if you have to
get rid of like super nitty patterns
that are ingrained in your game from way
back yeah I think it's harder to unlearn
than to learn from from from a blank I
think it's easier for example if you
would coach someone if you just get a
guy you know whose environment is set up
he he just finished school he knows a
little bit about poker but starting now
instead of a guy who's already been
grinding 10 years right um I know you do
a lot of reading you mentioned food by
Randomness any other book or I think you
also mentioned podcast a lot any book or
podcast recommendations that had a big
impact on your life or on your poker
game that you would recommend to our
audience I think Nasim talb has multiple
good books that they're right up my
alley at least I know he's kind of a
polarizing guy and not everyone loves
him or or his writing but I think those
books are really good like skin in the
game Fooled by Randomness
um one book by Morgan what is it called
Morgan housel or something like that the
psychology of money I think that was a
good one for poker people talked a lot
about like how it's kind of easy to uh
make a lot of money not so easy to keep
money uh and some of the reasons behind
that
and I think it's very like when I read a
couple of those chapters I I could
immediately like I started thinking
about some my friends that have a bit
more like higher risk tolerance than me
in poker maybe that like to take on a
bit more swings than me I started
thinking about yeah how it was very
applicable so psychology of money I
think is a good one
um yeah what else what else
yeah I I'll think about it see if I can
come up with something I wasn't yeah you
you can send me a list we'll link it in
the description down below any podcasts
I know you're big on
podcasts
um no not really that are focused on
this I would say like right now I'm what
am I even listening to I I've been like
listening to a lot of news podcasts
lately because the world is in like a
weird weird place right now where
there's a lot of stuff going on
like territorial disputes and crazy
stuff between different countries and
stuff like that so I kind of tend to get
into
these yeah Doom scroll Twitter quite a
lot and uh spend a lot of time getting
updated on what's going on with that um
lately I would say which is not
particularly productive or what people
should be doing of course I don't know
there's like one Health podcast that I
like a lot the drive uh by Peta I think
that one is very good huberman lab I'm
sure a lot of people know talks a lot
about like Health Fitness stuff
um yeah outside of that I don't know
mostly like news stuff I would say yeah
I think like Health
Fitness I think I saw like the you
recommended I think the huberman on
alcohol and then suddenly the whole
poker world started started listening to
that one by that time I already stopped
drinking so but there was definitely
still a lot of new things in there that
I wasn't uh that actually wasn't aware
of um yeah I want to thank you a lot for
sharing all this wisdom with our poker
audience what would you like the main
takeaway for our audience to be from the
conversation that we had today
um probably
that I don't know it's a weird one I
because I feel like this conversation
has
been I am in a weird space right now
where I'm almost using this conversation
as like a therapy session you know I'm
like airing out like vulnerabilities and
talking about like how stress and
stressed and anxious I am and whatever
um but I at the same time I don't mind
talking about these things because I
think it can be helpful to people who
maybe think that
once once you have success once you win
a tournament or you reach NL 40K uh if
you play cash or whatever it is like
whenever you hit these uh Milestones or
have these successes in poker everything
is going to be fine and you're going to
be so happy and life isn't really like
that you know it's not um um it's not
like a straight line thing and it's
not I think a lot of people have this uh
what is it called it's like some bias
where you reach your goal and you get
depressed after it because part of you
thought that you going to be so happy
once you just Reach This goal once you
lose all that weight once you finish
your degree once you get your job
promotion once
you get the relationship that you want
once you get this one thing that you've
been wanting everything's going to be
good and you're going to be so happy and
when you get there you realize that okay
your struggles are still your struggles
you're uh still dealing with the same
[ __ ] as before like and people get
to pressed over it um and I I I don't
think this is what's happened to Me
Maybe I I think my issues is more that
I've uh thrown a lot of uh balls up into
the air without catching like I I I need
to just like um land a bit some of these
projects that I've started to get in a
better heads space um but I do think
it's important to be honest about these
things and to be vulnerable so people
see that even if you have uh maybe from
the outside it looks like I have uh I
should be like the happiest guy ever I
have like I won the main event and like
whatever like uh playing tritons now and
all this stuff uh but I don't know like
it's everyone has their issues and I
think like if people were a bit more
like open and vulnerable and talking
openly about these issues it's a bit
more normalized because I think a lot of
people feel like they're alone with
their issues like
they're maybe they're on a down swing or
they're feeling anxious or lonely or
whatever it is yeah I feel lonely I feel
anxious I yeah I mean everyone does I
think normalizing these things is
pretty big win for everyone if people
don't have to feel alone with these
problems so yeah I don't know I feel
like this podcast today was a bit
incoherent in a lot of ways from my side
because my head is bit all over the
place but um at least it shows that um
yeah I don't have everything figured out
either you know like even if I have
successes in some part of my life I
still have say issues as everyone else
so yeah well I'm sure it will be very
much appreciated I have actually had
comments like in my community about
certain podcasts where they actually
felt good that the that that the person
uh shared like struggles because
sometimes they almost feel like that
they're an imposter trying to make it in
poker because you know all these guys
that have on there are also perfect and
they're also great so I'm sure there's
uh there's there's many people listening
for who this would be yeah very
inspiring podcast maybe in a different
way than some of the others uh but
inspiring
nonetheless hopefully yeah Adam any any
final question for
Aspen no I'd like to thank Aspen for his
time and for being so vulnerable we
appreciate you uh being yeah very open
to us on this conversation and going
deep into um the challenges you're
facing as you mentioned like it's very
easy from the outside to think at the
top it's all rainbows and butterflies
and everything feels amazing but we all
go through through the ups and downs of
life and you're going through a bit of a
cycle to some degree um yeah really
really appreciate you sharing that and
I'm sure the audience will really relate
to it because it's it's so much more
relatable to people because everyone
struggles to some degree not many people
succeed so when someone's struggling
who's also at the top it's I think it's
super relatable I think we'll get a lot
of really good feedback with people who
will feel heard understood and be able
to relate their problems to your
experience so we appreciate the time
you've spent with us today so thank
you yeah thanks for having me yeah it
was almost like I felt before this
podcast started there was like
construction outside my house um there
was a microphone issues some tech issues
and part of me felt [ __ ] I actually hope
this podcast doesn't happen today so I
almost felt anxious like going into a
podcast being in like such a head messy
head space but um yeah I'm glad we did
it and um yeah I appreciate you having
me I had fun I'm glad I'm I'm glad you
followed through was it was a great
episode great conversation with Aspen
Adam any main
takeaways yeah I think Aspen's had a
very uh unique experience of Poker
obviously playing a long time but then
having the main event win which is the
ultimate success point for any aspiran
poker player but as we've learned like
it doesn't necessarily create that end
of the story happiness forever kind of
moment and as he was speaking we could
see like the kind of the pitfalls of
just having success on outcomes and when
I asked him to define success it very
much for him linked more to being happy
and being healthy and right now
obviously he's going through a bit of a
phase where he's not feeling that his
best so so he's not feeling the
successful version of himself even
though from the outside he's got those
exteral metrics so makes me a reminder
to myself the audience to always put
your happiness your health your things
that you value as a person um at the
highest kind of level of your ranking
and yeah achievements will come and go
we'll go through Seasons not going to be
linear you're going to go through some
ups and downs and yes always going to
have that kind of um overarching theme
of trying to find that balance for
yourself which yeah has been trying to
find out in terms of like some of the
real positive skills that I think he's
developed were one is his resilience
which he's built over time and obviously
went through tough childhood went for a
lot of experiences there which maybe
bullying as a child as well through
schooling and that's allowed him to take
on adversity and not be affected by it
it was interesting in the questionnaire
we wrote what were your Rock Bottom's
moment moments and he wrote like pretty
much nothing pretty smooth line and then
as we spoke he like lost like two-thirds
of his role to crypto he lost like a
mass of half his role play MTS and this
didn't leave any ression and for me that
skill set is the ability to reframe
because events happen and then we tell
ourselves a story about those events and
that story is what can be good negative
or neutral and for him he just doesn't
create negative stories he doesn't
create that was a bad moment he goes
okay lost that on we go I think that
ability to uh not create a negative
story around things that have happened
is a really powerful skill which allows
you to move on from setbacks or reframe
a setback as a necessary part of the
journey which I think is a huge one for
him and yeah I think for he mentioned a
lot about routine as well he's a very
routine based guy myself I'm very
routine based I think all of us have
kind of an optimal routine that we can
develop which will help us to perform
best at what we're Curr currently trying
to do so always trying to prioritize
what you're doing in the morning before
you're starting your deer what are the
things you do in a simple way that allow
you to feel at your best it's generally
not many things is it meditation is it
some exercise is it walking your dog is
it doing some journaling it's not many
things but youve got to find a way to be
consistent with those things over time I
think that ESP been he's feeling a
little bit of the the lack of routine
from all the traveling because he's not
able to create that kind of solid
foundation of the things I I can do that
allow me to feel good um as well so yeah
I think we talk a lot about being lonely
as a Pok player as well the importance
of kind of having people on the journey
uh which I think is really important but
I think a lot of vulnerable things he
shared there which I really appreciate
and yeah I think a lot of the audience
will hopefully be able to relate to his
experience and take some positives from
that so was really good how about up
some of the main things that you wrote
down yeah it kind of sounded to me like
he was sort of pulled away from his
values by shiny objects so he won kind
of the main event he maybe in the past
you know didn't fall for the fomo of all
this life stops blah blah blah but now
suddenly you know he won the main event
it was very overwhelming suddenly all
these opportunities came on his path he
was like yes yes yes yes yes and without
reflecting like wait this is actually
still in line with my values right and
now I guess it was mainly his body that
was saying like hey man it's maybe time
to reflect to see if we're living the
life that we actually want and if it's
in line with what is actually important
um so I think if we speak to him again
right he talked maybe a little about
part two I think if we speak to him
again in like a year or so uh I think it
will be uh uh I feel like it's quite
natural right the the the thing that
that he goes through after you've like
if you would reflect on the journey I
would say it's it's it makes a lot of
sense or at least from the conversation
that we had with him I really understand
the where where he's coming from he also
emphasized a lot
on actually we both me and him we both
when we talked about the most enjoyable
moment we talked about the process
oriented right we were surrounded by
people right teaming up is both most fun
and both highest EV right he learned a
lot when you're with the same people but
it's just way more fun right and if you
have a lot of fun and if you have a lot
of enjoyment in the game guess what you
will play more you'll be more consistent
you will have higher volume you will
improve more so all these positive
things uh come from working in a team so
I would definitely recommend that I
think there's almost no podcast that
goes by without someone pointing out the
importance of working together with
other players so if you're not doing
that that's probably the first thing on
your list he also talked very much in
the beginning I think we talked about
about uh High feuds especially soft
feuds that we have to realize that for
example when the solver says a certain
shop I think pref flop right we talked
about is only like basically Break Even
slightly winning if the in the future I
think we talked about Texas the guy from
Texas right shout out to the guy from
Texas if he's gonna hand your stack very
likely to hand your stack next hand then
maybe you should pick pass on on that
shot where he said in more tough Fields
yeah like there's not going to be a
great spot next hand right because
everyone is going to play solid so even
a slightly plus EV spot is something
that should be taken so take future EV
in consideration also for example if you
play on a tough
table the chances are also that you will
get moved again within an hour for
example so that's something to take in
consideration if there's no highy spots
on your table but you look around and
you see a bunch of grandpas playing
cards right then maybe we should just
knit it up a little bit on that table
pass up on some marginal with these
spots and wait until we get moved to a
different table so stuff to
consideration he also talked about the
importance of making of marking hands
right he said Kazo your spots go to GTO
wizard look them up if you see a trend
in those spots that you keep on marking
drill them until you basically
understand them and I think this is
actually very nice about mtts you can
watch back all the big final tables you
can watch back the best players and
especially at the final table when ICM
is there uh you can probably learn a lot
right and then you can compare it to hey
are they doing what the solare is doing
if they deviate talk about it with your
network hey why do you think it deviates
here uh a lot of good ways and a lot of
good tips also on on that part to
improve your game I want to thank Aspen
again for being so vulnerable on this
podcast and sharing a story I think it
will definitely help a lot of players
sharing his story like the way he shared
it here today want to thank Adam for
hosting the podcast I want to thank you
guys for listening all the way until the
end like this video subscribe to the
channel notifications on all that good
stuff and I will see you guys in the
