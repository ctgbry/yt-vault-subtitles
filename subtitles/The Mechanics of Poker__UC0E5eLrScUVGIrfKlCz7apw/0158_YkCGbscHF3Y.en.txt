[00:00]
uh river is
the worst card in the deck the deuce
you can just bad range
and we call range
okay
so that's how it's gonna be that's how
it's gonna be i have to say i'm not very

[00:15]
it's gonna be i have to say i'm not very
good in chop bots

[01:30]
opportunity before the doors are closed
and let us help you realize your poker
goals go over to
pokerambition.com to enroll hi there
boys and girls welcome back to another
play and explain video
and without further ado let's get into
the action

[01:45]
the action
as you can see i actually already
gathered a nice little stacker on the
left that's because i was already
recording this video but my mic was not
on okay we basically i don't remember
exactly
i think we got aces in pre-flop

[02:01]
i think we got aces in pre-flop
skill game i know
uh however he folded was a bit of a
weird hand he timed for very long then
four but very big then i jammed and then
he again went in the tank it was a bit
weird
given the sizing i remember i wanted to
format but given the timing

[02:15]
format but given the timing
also saw some merit in calling
and then afterwards i stacked a
recreational player
who called my squeeze the board came low
and i had jax and i bet a big big
jam river and yet
two pair as well as it was three three

[02:30]
two pair as well as it was three three
six four
five
i believe
but yeah his two pair was not better
than my two pairs so that's how you get
stacks guys
that's the secret right there let's uh
keep the stack

[02:46]
to
maybe get into some deep spots would
maybe be interesting
and talk a little bit about some
adjustments that
i would recommend recommend making

[03:00]
i would recommend recommend making
i don't really know
who is who in the pool
so
if you're a regular watching
if you offended because i considered you
maybe a recreational player i apologize

[03:15]
maybe a recreational player i apologize
a little bit loose open here with the
king seven with a recreational big blind
or at least i'm assuming just because
he's not topping up
this guy i have played with him before
needs luck seems sounds reggish

[03:32]
needs luck seems sounds reggish
even though the recreations probably
need more luck but
it does snap call a 3x in the small
blind
that's uh
it's quite interesting

[03:45]
it's quite interesting
but with a with a small c bet with the
backdoor stuff going on
this defend actually is probably a bit
too loose

[04:00]
donna don't follow everything i say all
right
he thought about it for a little while i
decided to call
makes me feel like
he might have underpair and i'm gonna
get a snap fold now

[04:19]
take a little lead here on the turn
basically
i don't really check call any error on
the flop so
just by check calling and the board
pairing

[04:33]
i think i just have
quite an advantage
he makes a very small race i think queen
three
we will probably defend
because we're not blocking any of the

[04:46]
because we're not blocking any of the
bluffs
we don't have great outs though in terms
of if he has a king we're pretty dead
but i think
rush complete and there is a straight

[05:01]
rush complete and there is a straight
what to do
in doubt
oh bad half pot then i'm i'm in doubt
between a couple of sizings let's let's
just end up in the middle
uh he had ace 10

[05:16]
uh he had ace 10
and we won with the queen three i guess
he checked behind because he thought
that we could sometimes have a draw like
then jack
or a worse first draw but i don't mind
this line i think it's fine
however i would probably raise a bit

[05:30]
however i would probably raise a bit
bigger on the term
to put my queenics
more of a spot and if i have not flushed
or i'll keep on calling anyway
min race quite deep

[05:48]
and i'm gonna call i think still any
pair when the board is disconnected
on the turn i probably prefer parts
could make a argument for a small bat

[06:00]
could make a argument for a small bat
to get some protection on the turn
maybe some tim value so that's what i'll
do
you can also check and call most rivers
of
both place
are optional kind of depends on

[06:17]
are optional kind of depends on
how much money you think
you will make on the river by bluff
catching
make a little call here with the a6
let's try a little donkey for the fans

[06:34]
this guy's a recreational but i actually
play
i'm not really sure if this tag is
correct i'm gonna remove it for now

[06:47]
interesting turn
i'm gonna continue uh

[07:01]
i'm gonna continue uh
with another blocky
here with the ace four

[07:19]
chop first age jack
stan
i was good i thought about obviously you
think about barreling or checking that's
that's quite obvious uh

[07:31]
that's quite obvious uh
the downside of barreling this hand
would be that i would probably just get
called by all the nut flush draws i'm
not really sure what a worse flush draw
would do but i was gonna bat around
three quarters
uh the four is not that great if he had
pocket force that's a hand that he could

[07:45]
pocket force that's a hand that he could
probably fold the turn with
not really sure like i would probably
prefer to have like jack dan jack queen
like blockers to overpairs i think that
would probably work better

[08:01]
would probably work better
then we had the ace4 i3 ballad
and simulate the flop for three quarters
which is
i mean it's around half about three
quarters ace four can definitely be in
there
i assumed he was already going to fault

[08:15]
i assumed he was already going to fault
force and flop quite often a lot of ace
highs already on the flop as well so
that's gonna be interesting in terms of
what i was considering turn
the six
diamonds he should actually lead range
it's quite an interesting concept
and again it's mainly

[08:31]
and again it's mainly
he called it through that
under the gun then he checked all the
three quarters bet on the flop so
basically
just by the fact that he called he now
has
a range advantage because this is here
under the gun at six percent we only

[08:45]
under the gun at six percent we only
have 39 however
we are still a favor in terms of the
best hands that we have in our range
like the over pairs
um but we also have trash and he never
has trash and this is kind of where the
equity switch sort of comes from okay
and

[09:00]
and
if this is the range composition you
have quite a lot of good hands and weak
hands and you want to sort of protect
against trash hands what do you bet 20
he checks so this this sim is now
already a little bit screwed because
people are not dunking range here on
this turn

[09:17]
this turn
uh
and h4 is just always checking like i
said i wanted to have sort of blockers
like jack then a clubs for example would
have been great queen jack would have
been great okay so seems like my thought
process here is reasonably spell on i
think i was talked about bearing the ace

[09:30]
think i was talked about bearing the ace
king especially without the spade
i mean
sometimes yes sometimes no
same with the ace queen his queen is
yeah sometimes yes sometimes no i mean
both have benefits if you have a spade
you can blast bait rivers if you don't
have a spade you get called by spades so

[09:46]
have a spade you get called by spades so
it kind of goes either way so i think i
think my thought process here was uh
reasonably on point
i'll make a gold four but here
and of course the three five when

[10:00]
and of course the three five when
overcalling definitely look at
playing like clean hands like you don't
want to be overcalling king 10 off suit
here for example but i think 53 suited
works quite well
here i'm just going to start off with a
one third but

[10:19]
do we want to bluff this
do like having the five and three

[10:30]
do like having the five and three
let's go for it but
and hope he folds another pair they're
both basically folding on the pair
that's kind of the idea
is barrel here with the ace king putting
on a lot of pressure
there's a mirror race that's a bit of a

[10:46]
there's a mirror race that's a bit of a
weird play
i put chips this
kind of sucks in terms of
i know who this guy is

[11:01]
i'm leaning towards folding

[11:16]
i'm gonna make a bit of a knitty fold
here
i mean i called four bet we're quite
deep so i won't be doing that with the
too much trashy hands okay

[11:33]
too much trashy hands okay
and
ace five foods close i would definitely
fault the hand like ace nine or a six
uh a6

[11:45]
uh a6
a7s89 i would definitely be folding
but i think the ace five could or should
probably still call
he goes for an overhead on the river

[12:09]
pretty sure he would do it

[12:15]
pocket fives or something
we're definitely going to be calling ace
jack
i'll be calling some two pairs

[12:34]
is deuce or something i think is a bit
of a better call
and then obviously you know i love
strong hands

[12:50]
because like
he might not always have deuces but he
could always have fives he could have
five six suited and not six do suited
but i think ace deuce ace3 will make
better calls than ace five

[13:03]
but this hand i actually completely
misread in game apparently i called from
the small blind i thought i called from
the big blind so
we're gonna
review the hand
um

[13:15]
um
as if we called from the big blind
because that's kind of where my thoughts
were going so i think that this uh
that is most relevant
b bets one third which i also saw him do
on the other i think it was a stand
seven
um so he apparently he uses just a lot

[13:31]
um so he apparently he uses just a lot
of small betting as a strategy so this
team is already not very correct in the
first place
but that's something interesting to take
care of to take in consideration
the turn is a 10 and diamonds

[13:46]
the turn is a 10 and diamonds
jack
he bets three quarters which i think is
fine
um i was leaning towards folding the a7s
and and that's because like the most
natural hands that people like to barrel

[14:00]
natural hands that people like to barrel
are
equity hands right gutters so seven
eight eight nine
as you can see here these hands actually
check quite often
i think in practice though they bet a
little bit more often if you had a six
so six five i think this hand probably
barrels more often as well

[14:15]
barrels more often as well
don't really see
what checking is achieving i would have
probably borrowed this as well and then
when i talked also about the low pairs
that are also going to be in there at a
certain frequency but it's going to be
quite interesting we do indeed see that
h3 for example and h2s are your primary

[14:30]
h3 for example and h2s are your primary
calls this is also where i was leaning
towards here you can also see the ace
four and a h3 call more than for example
on an ace five hand and that's mainly i
think because of the pocket fives
uh maybe 540 sometimes bluffing
yeah
mainly mainly it's going to be the

[14:45]
mainly mainly it's going to be the
concept is mainly around
blocking these hands
like i said i think if we give him more
seven eight eight nine we're going to be
folding more of these aces as well so i
think so far
my thought process was good and then the
river is the four of spades

[15:01]
river is the four of spades
and now he decided to go for an overpass
played the hand pretty gto approved and
now i was going to call it ace 2's and
h3
is definitely calling way more than ace
five so again that makes sense age jack

[15:16]
five so again that makes sense age jack
is actually always folding that's
interesting i would have called ace jack
but i guess he has more bluffs around
the jack than value around the jack
he has king jack but okay so he's also
always bluffing jack then
and that's then

[15:30]
and that's then
more relevant apparently than blocking
um
then blocking the straight
maybe the straight goes in the overbet
on the turn that then also plays a part
so that's again something that i would
have got done wrong

[15:48]
ace 10 is actually falling quite a lot
that makes a lot of sense and then queen
6 for example is probably calling yeah
queen six is always calling so this
again has something to do that a lot of
his bluffs are around king 10 jack then
so you would much rather call a3

[16:02]
so you would much rather call a3
than ace 10 and you would much rather
call queen six than all the other hands
and to go back to the gold four by hand
i mean i called for about a deep we see
that at the flop which is quite good for

[16:16]
that at the flop which is quite good for
us then and the queen i mean we make a
bunch of king queen suited sace queen
suited says jack suited
we still have jax queens kings asus
tents it's just basically
our range is just so strong
that

[16:30]
that
if he decides to
bluff race to turn into that range i
mean not gonna be a great play
and i think it's
also not really a range that people are
too excited to start bluffing in
so without any further information i

[16:47]
so without any further information i
will lean towards passivity there
we only needed i think fourteen percent
we did have four out so that's eight
maybe some implied dots

[17:03]
but maybe also like
i guess calling just to hit a straight
given the odds that he gave me would
have also been an option
not sure i just leaned towards the

[17:17]
not sure i just leaned towards the
the passive side maybe he
sometimes i remember one of my first
poker books that i've ever read they
talked about the freeze play
basically what you do is
you race turn small to check behind the

[17:30]
you race turn small to check behind the
river so if he does that sometimes then
my ace and king is sometimes good and he
just checks bad nines or something
uh
yeah then that would actually also be
an option
this board i can approach in a couple of
ways

[17:45]
ways
i can just go for like a very small bat
like 10 percent or so
or i could go for a check
i elected to go for a check and play
more big bad check if the board does
rainbow i usually tend to play more

[18:01]
rainbow i usually tend to play more
small bat
but
nothing is good or bad either way and i
think this hand just always wants to
check three streets

[18:21]
if it starts checking
but i think also if you would bet
let's say about 10 the flop
i would probably

[18:32]
also
check turn
but after betting it's more likely that
the
especially when the flush completes it's
more likely that he will check behind
twice with an ace so that could
make you want to

[18:45]
make you want to
[Music]
lean more towards betting yourself on
the turn but i think if we go in check
mode there's no ace that's gonna check
behind three times
so we don't lose any value we only lose

[19:00]
so we don't lose any value we only lose
value from a king
but that's quite unlikely now is it
because we have kings
and we want the maximum amount of money
there for h10 and i think this hand is a
great example of
trying to pick a line that you're gonna
stack

[19:15]
stack
his worst good hands
obviously if he would have been bad
actually maybe he would have been bad he
could find a fault we're playing in
quite tight positions

[20:06]
all right i'll take that
and shall we just ram this one in as
well to try to get aces in twice let's
go

[20:19]
we also sometimes call here but you know
given the fact that we were all in here
with aces i decided to jam this one see
if we could get aces all in twice
that would make for a good clickbait but

[20:30]
that would make for a good clickbait but
unfortunately
that didn't work but hey
he don't hear me complaining guys so
don't misinterpret this
okay
but yeah i definitely think to come back

[20:46]
but yeah i definitely think to come back
to the king's hand
uh betting the river is
you would just let's say for example we
would have bet the rivers three quarters
and he would have called
some people are like okay nice
nice one a pot but you need to try to

[21:01]
nice one a pot but you need to try to
win a stack there and i think the only
way you can win a stack is to take the
line that i took
as played obviously you can just go back
a bit as well
which i think after after betting

[21:18]
let's say i would have bet 10 percent on
the flop and we've checked the turn
he could maybe step once with ace and
check behind the river
but most likely would check the turn and
still bet the river maybe even check
behind the river some people

[21:31]
behind the river some people
i mean
can be uh can be quite nitty
let's try it a bit

[21:48]
these are pots that like the jack 3 here
these are actually spots that people
often don't really care about but in my
opinion it's a spot where we should
definitely
try to win the pot quite often

[22:00]
try to win the pot quite often

[23:34]
off offbot here
interesting step size
a huge check race
4.8 access quite a lot

[23:48]
the plan now is to call and
hit a flush
flush is always good as well so that's
good this is a good turn
for him he did check race four five or

[24:00]
for him he did check race four five or
something
i think i'm gonna call one more once
more

[24:24]
an easy check on the river
let's hope he found like seven five

[24:30]
let's hope he found like seven five
suited six five suited
add queen 3.

[25:07]
a little dunk bed here with the king
queen
under the model of why not
under the model off don't try this at
home

[25:15]
home
under the motto of
i don't think the sport really to be
dunked mr wacko
and on the turn it's a very good turn
for him we do have a hand that can still
improve
however
he probably has quite a lot of my outs

[25:31]
he probably has quite a lot of my outs
with the 10. that would really suck
and i think i'm actually blocking a lot
of the plus king king 9 king jack or
something actually i'm just gonna fall
there

[25:49]
the good thing with the ace queen there
was as well that
for example the six and the three
were of diamonds and i had the queen of
diamonds so there were not a lot of
rivers that would give his sets boats
and

[26:01]
and
me
a flush
make a nitty-ish fault here i think
as well here phase of one third bat

[26:15]
not a theoretically
approved sizing for your range but i can
think of a hand that would want to do it
i think ace queen uh usually makes it
in a down call here
even though

[26:30]
even though
asus for example maybe hand like king
queen actually is a better hand to call
down with
than ace queen because he's more likely
to check maybe aces on the turn for
example
okay this really sucks

[26:46]
this is a very good river for him
uh it's a very good river for him yeah
i'm [ __ ]
i'm very [ __ ]
yeah king queen i think is my best buff

[27:00]
yeah king queen i think is my best buff
catcher here
we have the ace queen with the ace of
spades blocking ace for suited that
would be good as well
obviously a pair now any pair now is
better given the way the board ran out

[27:16]
yeah i think now i should just call any
pair and king queen
and then maybe ace queen with the ace of
the ace of spades

[27:30]
the ace of spades
the river the river wouldn't have paired
i would have definitely
or at least consider the call but most
probably i would have still called down
the 442 rainbow and often oversea by the

[27:45]
the 442 rainbow and often oversea by the
board if you
look at uh theory at least but i do
think you can get away with it he used
the one-third sizing
actually it was still used quite often
uh i mentioned asus and we saw later on
that someone also used the 130 for aces

[28:01]
that someone also used the 130 for aces
aces makes a lot of sense but if you're
only bat
if you only had a betting range and
maybe you split between three quarters
and one third aces should definitely get
into the one third
um he decided to bat the one third
usually you you want to bet a little bit

[28:16]
usually you you want to bet a little bit
bigger because there's a lot of hands
that i'm going to call with right now
and basically by betting one third
you're going to give me quite a good
price to realize my equity and i kind of
now decide when we want to build a
bigger pot uh
or not if i call it's queen oh

[28:32]
or not if i call it's queen oh
the term was the four and that's where
it gets interesting
he used uh
somewhere between half bottom three
quarters well that's indeed correct now
is it my friend somewhere between hotpot

[28:45]
is it my friend somewhere between hotpot
actually you should block again that's
quite interesting i would not have
thought about blocking again yeah maybe
if you have ace queen the thought of
blocking again comes into my mind but
not with a lot of other hands and again
here we can see the difference i was
talking about king queen versus ace

[29:00]
talking about king queen versus ace
queen aces is often blocking or checking
it's not really gonna go in the sizing
um so that's gonna make up for something
interesting let's say he bet half pot
because the sim in general plays a
little bit bigger
20 big blinds better 24 big blinds

[29:15]
20 big blinds better 24 big blinds
there's half parts i mean ace queen
basically never falls
king queen is actually folding that's
probably because he's sometimes betting
ace king in this sizing
um
ace queen sorry sometimes betting ace
queen in the sizing

[29:31]
queen in the sizing
so therefore king queen
is worse than ace queen but like i said
mainly i think the aces and kings
difference that's really going to show
in practice i don't think people put a
lot of ace highs in this bad sizing on
the turn but if he doesn't bet any put

[29:45]
the turn but if he doesn't bet any put
much ace highs in this bad sizing on the
turn and the only his height that he
does put in his ace king for example
then i think king queen is a better call
than uh than a screen
call
river is
the worst card in the deck the deuce

[30:01]
the worst card in the deck the deuce
he can just bad range kind of assumed
and we call range okay so that's how
it's gonna be that's how it's gonna be i
have to say i'm not very good in chop
bots but yeah apparently uh i blundered

[30:16]
bots but yeah apparently uh i blundered
this one quite hard because he can bet
range and then we still
have four or five bb ish call oh here we
do in dc that the ace of spades
is better
so my thoughts on calling the ace of
spades on the river were indeed correct

[30:31]
spades on the river were indeed correct
king queen
is indeed way higher in ev
eleven big blinds versus five big blinds
so i was going to call any pair
any king queen and i wanted to have the
ace of spades
and we can see that
my

[30:45]
my
reasoning was going in the right
direction however i apparently missed
completely
how much money we were actually making
but as you can see here it's also
because a lot of hands are no longer in
this line for example there's no tents
in this line from out of position

[31:00]
in this line from out of position
uh there's very little jackson queens
so
it kind of depends how
he constructs his range but then again
also on the flop he was checking 44
percent of the time there were a lot of
air hands that he could bear off with
that decided to check the flop so very

[31:16]
that decided to check the flop so very
interested
interesting what you guys think
about this spot
yeah i i i would have preferred to
not have the ace as mentioned but maybe
i took this
way too far

[31:36]
this guy went for a small check res on
the flop check turn could be and like
pocket deuces or something let's say i
had a screen without any spade i
wouldn't have might betting the turn

[31:45]
wouldn't have might betting the turn
because then we can sometimes get caught
by a flusher or something that's not
really applicable now so i'll check
behind

[32:03]
i'm just going to fold the river it'll
start with a check with the pocket
queens
he checked behind quite fast the six i
think does interact a little bit with
this range
so i think i can get some value now

[32:16]
he does race that's quite unfortunate he
did it quite fast so i'm just going to
fold
just fold and fold and fold and fold in
half
three let's give it to jackman suited

[32:30]
three let's give it to jackman suited
we could also check again but i think
then we might
miss a street of hands that would often
call like 7 6x 8x jackax
but that's why i decided to bet the turn
instead of checking the turn
obviously the benefit of checking the
turn is that he could sometimes start

[32:45]
turn is that he could sometimes start
bluffing but we already gave him the
opportunity to
step some air on the flop he didn't
he would have probably already bet some
aces so i think just betting turned
small
and
on a lot of rivers i was planning on

[33:00]
on a lot of rivers i was planning on
betting again this is also
in determining whether you should check
turn or bad veteran also to take
consideration if we're going to bed the
river and i was planning on
betting the rivers there on uh

[33:15]
betting the rivers there on uh
on blanks sure
dunk hunter cause a 3x again from the
small blind so i'm assuming recreational
but tobacco you call the smallmouth all

[33:30]
but tobacco you call the smallmouth all
the time ah but not versus 3x
ux is bit expensive
i'm just going to make a
a bet we don't have to call it value we
don't have to call it bluff it's just a
little bit in the middle

[33:45]
little bit in the middle
life is god
otherwise are also recreational
um
i'm going to use the same argument here
no spates i would sometimes barrel
with space i think just check if he bets

[34:00]
with space i think just check if he bets
the river i'm most probably calling i
just see
recreationals turn over enough king jack
jack queen king queen on the river or
even the same hand or even a worse and
ace like ace eight or something
they're just betting because yeah they
don't really want to check
basically

[34:22]
whatever with a small bet there and
i think this is an okay candidate to
clip off blocking ajax suited blocking
pocket jacks [ __ ] ice cream [ __ ]

[34:31]
pocket jacks [ __ ] ice cream [ __ ]
king queen
i think that one would have made it all
the way

[34:48]
actually a board where we could
have some bets
we want to check our bet really depends
on how aggressive you think he's going
to be
let me let me start off with a bet

[35:03]
i think it's definitely good to create a
betting range here
it's a very good turn
awesome terms for my range i think
actually i'm going to size down a little
bit just because how good the turn is

[35:16]
bit just because how good the turn is
you're trying to think of his range here
in in terms of
you want you wanna in poker
guys in poker you always try to put your
opponent in a tough spot if i would just
over bet here
uh none of his pairs are on the top spot

[35:39]
everything grab jam on the river

[35:47]
let's throw out a tribativity k9 why the
[ __ ]
he has pocket jacks how do you have
pocket jacks my friend

[36:00]
do not try that at home kids
flatten pocket jacks
k9 this seems like quite a safe port
so let's start trial at the bet

[36:22]
this answers actually probably never
make it in a three bet in the first
place but hey we're here now

[36:31]
at like jack nine or something i think
it's a fine through but we're gonna turn
we have a check
don't think he's gonna call a bet with
ace king on the turn for example

[36:48]
oh this is quite close but five for
suited as people here on the channel
might know is my favorite hand
but that the fact that that's my
favorite that could actually get me in

[37:00]
favorite that could actually get me in
trouble i think i'm gonna call once i'm
not too thrilled about it
and actually i don't mind using the four
here
as a check race

[37:15]
as a check race
i have some ace queen some king queen
nines fours
i think this ends actually fine
and he had jacks
that was to be expected that he would
show up with a hand like that but i
guess on the turn versus one third

[37:34]
he could sometimes bat aids or sort of
protection
but
maybe i'm just too optimistic that i
think
i think
checking is better than betting

[37:45]
checking is better than betting
and maybe we should just
you know maybe we just make money versus
the check-back range and not versus the
betting range that could uh i could
definitely see that
hard to review this hand because i don't
think king nine
ever makes it through that
as mentioned indeed the king 9 suited

[38:01]
as mentioned indeed the king 9 suited
almost to never makes it you either want
to be a bit lower a bit higher however
the sim is a membrane so he did open
2.3 so we would probably through it a
little bit more but still i don't think
king 9 should be in there
but hey i just felt like throwing a

[38:16]
but hey i just felt like throwing a
little three bet flop i went for a
three-quarters bat which is the
preferred bat sizing king nine is always
going to be in there kind of as expected
and actually on the turn it gets becomes
quite interesting actually versus the

[38:30]
quite interesting actually versus the
big bad he should actually already fold
his hand some of the time quite
quite funky and i think actually in
practice usually if you face this people
don't have the k9 suited so i would
definitely
consider folding these hands if you face

[38:45]
consider folding these hands if you face
this line versus your population
the turn is a nine and now it's up to us
the king nine is clearly checking the
eight nine is actually sometimes
barreling simply because it has a bit
more equity it can get called by eights
it can get the hand like tents and jacks
probably to fall again so it has some

[39:01]
probably to fall again so it has some
bearing up fits but like i said the king
nine if we do barrel was advertising
half pot i think i mentioned ace king is
probably folding most of the time
whereas if we check
probably ace king i think actually ace
king is going to go to showdown a bit

[39:16]
king is going to go to showdown a bit
more often than we see here
um
so he
needs to have like some small betting
simply just to protect versus my random
king queen off suit for example they
decided to go for a wonder bat and this
is actually the interesting point

[39:30]
is actually the interesting point
because let's make it a bit bigger king
9 actually just ships it in i think it's
just time to ship it in and go to bed
okay and it's it's quite funky and again
it's trying to use its very strong
ranged advantage big plan first under
the gun to make him fault tense jacks

[39:46]
the gun to make him fault tense jacks
it's actually calling sometimes with
eights and eight nine suited even though
and they're not in there quite often ace
four spades actually calls as well ace
eight of spades probably not in the
range i would say but ace four of spades
could definitely be in there eights

[40:01]
could definitely be in there
ain't suited i don't think it's in there
tens and jacks i think that's the jax
could definitely fold the turn here we
have a good blocker so
yeah i think jamming here is actually
quite a good play
uh i mean it's a solver over usually
makes quite a good place so

[40:16]
makes quite a good place so
chicken song for the wacko for not
jamming here guys
[Music]
lemonade to the face of three bet

[40:31]
going to
make the call
back door
straight flush draw for the optimistic
poker players out there
unless he bets three quarters
probably continue he checks

[40:49]
bit suspicious bit suspicious i might
say but i think i'll draw the step
let's say he did
want to implement
a checking range here could include

[41:00]
a checking range here could include
eight or sevens
i think we have an easy bet again here
now that we have improved still blocking
the eights and sevens
you could have

[41:15]
you could have
just two over cards
they want a bet too big i think they're
still hands like six or seven eights
that do want to bet some of the time
nine acts
i think on the river
so suspicious with this flop check

[41:33]
so suspicious with this flop check
[Music]
she checked the flop but he could easily
still have ace queen stephanie and
the candidate that i would think about
to play this way is queen maybe he's
just trapping me with nines races i
think ace four is five

[41:48]
think ace four is five
his king is one of these hands
i know i think it's very suspicious
very suspicious
the river was not a queen i would have

[42:01]
the river was not a queen i would have
definitely fired but
ace like ace king you can
just bat flop i will call you with this
jackass queen
but obviously with a screen erase jack
the the value of betting goes down a
little bit so i can then if you would
then find a check

[42:17]
then find a check
i figured that that would be a hand that
you would do it with
and not ace king
also i guess i had like king queen
suited or something
so like king queen at diamonds or

[42:30]
so like king queen at diamonds or
something he could have
which would also not be great
the queen is uh the queen was not my
favorite card
we face a check
and this is where i have to be very

[42:45]
and this is where i have to be very
careful with projection
and
assuming
because we can indeed see that ace king
is checking quite often
how i interpret this in my head usually
is that i'll bet ace king most of the
time and check ace queen for example

[43:01]
time and check ace queen for example
most of the time but if people
especially nowadays they kind of balance
and use more rng
then i think i should be very careful
making very drastical assumptions but
okay

[43:15]
okay
we indeed better hand most of the time
let me see if there's something with
this call range we talked about the king
queen of diamonds getting there on the
river that's indeed a hand that could
definitely play this way often doesn't
check flop here very often i think
that's a hand that definitely benefits
from tracking

[43:31]
from tracking
um
[Music]
he obviously cause all the ace queen the
ace kings actually you should check race
ace king quite often he should check
some over pairs should call aces
yeah i was definitely also suspicious of
that aces and ninths yeah checking most

[43:46]
that aces and ninths yeah checking most
often but maybe like i said maybe i was
being a bit too suspicious
turn five you should check for example
there's also some hands that are now
and
we won't but mainly off bots that's kind
of what i was going for like i said i

[44:01]
of what i was going for like i said i
think we still want a better end like
sixes sevens so in my head i would have
just constructed the betting range
around the half pot seven eight
definitely in there
and let me see so ace queen is actually
sometimes folding a skin and something

[44:15]
sometimes folding a skin and something
that's folding so if you know sometimes
false is queen then obviously a queen
river is less bad for us he's calling
with the
flush draws
but for example and like jack 10 i think
is way more likely to see that so there

[44:30]
is way more likely to see that so there
are some hands here that i don't really
think are going to be in the range
but again should be maybe a little bit
careful here with my assumptions
uh the river is not a 10
but the river is
queen

[44:45]
queen
and now he should actually do some
dunking but that's also quite
interesting queen jack and king queen
for example shoot sometimes dunk
uh but then again also some blasters
don't sometimes don't but these hands i
think usu so like i said the jack then i
think is often played different king 10

[45:01]
think is often played different king 10
maybe
uh and then the queen axe
that he does river i think they're most
likely checking towards us this is not
good for our hand
we can actually see that seven eight is
giving up

[45:16]
giving up
i was bluffing this one every time uh i
would feel pretty bad with myself if i
was to check back the river uh i would
hate myself i just feel like a complete
and utter coward i would rather over
bluff and and sleep well at night so

[45:30]
bluff and and sleep well at night so
piou over is completely coward here
because it's mainly for mainly folding
eighths and sevenths
and that's not really a hand that we
want to block that's one obviously he
did indeed improve the ace queen i was
indeed worried about asus and knights

[45:46]
indeed worried about asus and knights
being in there quite often he should
actually still call ace king some of the
time it's quite interesting should even
call ace 10 of diamonds i don't think
that's going to happen i do think he's
going to go with h3 h4 h5
uh these are definitely hands that i

[46:00]
uh these are definitely hands that i
think he could find and i do in the
degree that
sevens and eights are not great if there
was a if the river was not
a queen or a king i would have
definitely bluffed and actually checked
it in the solver and the solver
definitely agreed with me love was
actually making quite some money

[46:15]
actually making quite some money
as well if you have 10 no 13
and as you can see here we can bluff
basically the [ __ ] out of him on a
thames river
because he's just gonna have a lot of
hands that are going to fold and a lot
of my bluffs will have improved on a 10
with queen 10 jack then these type of
holdings so nothing giving up on the

[46:32]
holdings so nothing giving up on the
queen
was
that i think if he would have given up
on the 10 that would have been bad but
like i said that would have not given up
on the 10 i think now also he's more
likely to call sevens and eight so
we're blocking more calls and we're
unblocking more folds so

[46:46]
unblocking more folds so
i think his hand that's okay blade
