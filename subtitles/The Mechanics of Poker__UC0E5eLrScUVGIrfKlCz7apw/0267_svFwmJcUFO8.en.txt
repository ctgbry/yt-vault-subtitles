don't they don't punt. They play pretty

[18:02]
don't they don't punt. They play pretty

don't they don't punt. They play pretty
well. Like, if they're not overly

well. Like, if they're not overly
focused, their baseline strategy is

[18:05]
focused, their baseline strategy is

[18:05]
focused, their baseline strategy is
still pretty good. I'm a little more

[18:07]
still pretty good. I'm a little more

[18:07]
still pretty good. I'm a little more
sporadic. I've always really liked my A

[18:09]
sporadic. I've always really liked my A

game and I felt like when I'm fully

focused I can perform at a really high

[18:12]
focused I can perform at a really high

focused I can perform at a really high
level. And so I really have had to work

[18:14]
level. And so I really have had to work

level. And so I really have had to work
hard to kind of drive up that C game to

[18:17]
hard to kind of drive up that C game to

hard to kind of drive up that C game to
like just make sure that when I'm

great book called Can't Hurt Me. And

[36:34]
great book called Can't Hurt Me. And
this book was super helpful in kind of

[36:37]
this book was super helpful in kind of

[36:37]
this book was super helpful in kind of
what you're saying. And one of the

you mentioned having a strong belief you
can get there. At some point, belief

[37:22]
can get there. At some point, belief

[37:22]
can get there. At some point, belief
needs backed up with evidence. So, if we

needs backed up with evidence. So, if we
can stack evidence day by day over time,

[37:26]
can stack evidence day by day over time,

then when we get to those tough moments,

[37:28]
then when we get to those tough moments,

then when we get to those tough moments,
it's like, what's my evidence bank that

[37:29]
it's like, what's my evidence bank that

[37:30]
it's like, what's my evidence bank that
shows me I can actually show up in this

not? Yeah, really love that. There so

[38:22]
not? Yeah, really love that. There so
many so many angles we could cover in

[38:23]
many so many angles we could cover in

many so many angles we could cover in
that one. But I want to segue quickly

that one. But I want to segue quickly

[38:25]
that one. But I want to segue quickly
into you studying engineering because I

[38:27]
into you studying engineering because I

[38:27]
into you studying engineering because I
know that was also a big part of your

[38:28]
know that was also a big part of your

[38:28]
know that was also a big part of your
background. How did that shape your

[38:30]
background. How did that shape your

[38:30]
background. How did that shape your
approach to poker overall, both from

[38:32]
approach to poker overall, both from

[38:32]
approach to poker overall, both from
playing and studying?

[38:35]
playing and studying?

[38:35]
playing and studying?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think um I think it was a belief

[38:38]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think um I think it was a belief

[38:38]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think um I think it was a belief
thing as well, right? Right? Like in

[38:40]
thing as well, right? Right? Like in

[38:40]
thing as well, right? Right? Like in
college, I played soccer and I I thought

[38:42]
college, I played soccer and I I thought

[38:42]
college, I played soccer and I I thought
for a little bit there that I was going

[38:43]
for a little bit there that I was going

[38:43]
for a little bit there that I was going
to try to play soccer for forever. And

[38:45]
to try to play soccer for forever. And

[38:45]
to try to play soccer for forever. And
so school for me was was a little bit

[38:47]
so school for me was was a little bit

[38:47]
so school for me was was a little bit
secondary through some of those years

[38:48]
secondary through some of those years

[38:48]
secondary through some of those years
and I still got through a very difficult

[38:50]
and I still got through a very difficult

[38:50]
and I still got through a very difficult
major um that was quite competitive as

[38:53]
major um that was quite competitive as

[38:53]
major um that was quite competitive as
well. And so I think that like from a

[38:55]
well. And so I think that like from a

[38:55]
well. And so I think that like from a
belief standpoint, it showed that like I

[38:57]
belief standpoint, it showed that like I

[38:57]
belief standpoint, it showed that like I
felt like I could do anything. I can

[38:58]
felt like I could do anything. I can

[38:58]
felt like I could do anything. I can
learn anything. Like if I had a big test

[39:01]
learn anything. Like if I had a big test

[39:01]
learn anything. Like if I had a big test
on organic chemistry, like whatever we

[39:03]
on organic chemistry, like whatever we

[39:03]
on organic chemistry, like whatever we
just won some big match and went out the

[39:05]
just won some big match and went out the

[39:05]
just won some big match and went out the
the night after, like I can cram it in a

[39:07]
the night after, like I can cram it in a

[39:07]
the night after, like I can cram it in a
day and I can learn and do fine. I can

[39:09]
day and I can learn and do fine. I can

[39:09]
day and I can learn and do fine. I can
get by. And so I think that like the

[39:10]
get by. And so I think that like the

[39:10]
get by. And so I think that like the
belief was important and I think the

[39:12]
belief was important and I think the

[39:12]
belief was important and I think the
structure was was super important. I

[39:15]
structure was was super important. I

[39:15]
structure was was super important. I
have a lot of great friends. Um and

[39:16]
have a lot of great friends. Um and

[39:16]
have a lot of great friends. Um and
there's no there's no right way, right?

[39:18]
there's no there's no right way, right?

[39:18]
there's no there's no right way, right?
But I have a lot of great friends that

[39:19]
But I have a lot of great friends that

[39:19]
But I have a lot of great friends that
didn't go to college and and that comes

[39:21]
didn't go to college and and that comes

[39:22]
didn't go to college and and that comes
with that comes with other benefits and

[39:24]
with that comes with other benefits and

[39:24]
with that comes with other benefits and
other deficiencies. But one thing that

[39:25]
other deficiencies. But one thing that

[39:25]
other deficiencies. But one thing that
I'm very grateful for with with the

[39:27]
I'm very grateful for with with the

[39:27]
I'm very grateful for with with the
engineering school is that I had to

[39:29]
engineering school is that I had to

[39:29]
engineering school is that I had to
learn to structure my time. I had to

[39:31]
learn to structure my time. I had to

[39:31]
learn to structure my time. I had to
learn to set up my things in a way that

[39:33]
learn to set up my things in a way that

[39:33]
learn to set up my things in a way that
I can go study very hard for 4 hours and

[39:37]
I can go study very hard for 4 hours and

[39:37]
I can go study very hard for 4 hours and
learn the subject. I'm not going to

[39:38]
learn the subject. I'm not going to

[39:38]
learn the subject. I'm not going to
waste time on my phone. I'm not gonna

[39:39]
waste time on my phone. I'm not gonna

[39:39]
waste time on my phone. I'm not gonna
like have a YouTube video on and and

[39:42]
like have a YouTube video on and and

[39:42]
like have a YouTube video on and and
watch a Mechanics of Poker podcast while

[39:43]
watch a Mechanics of Poker podcast while

[39:43]
watch a Mechanics of Poker podcast while
I'm having intense study, right? That's

[39:45]
I'm having intense study, right? That's

[39:45]
I'm having intense study, right? That's
that that's not the right way to like

[39:47]
that that's not the right way to like

[39:47]
that that's not the right way to like
learn. I want to watch the podcast and

[39:49]
learn. I want to watch the podcast and

[39:49]
learn. I want to watch the podcast and
get as much as I can out of that and

[39:50]
get as much as I can out of that and

[39:50]
get as much as I can out of that and
then I want to go have this. And so I

[39:52]
then I want to go have this. And so I

[39:52]
then I want to go have this. And so I
think like the the process of of

[39:54]
think like the the process of of

[39:54]
think like the the process of of
learning and studying I felt like I had

[39:56]
learning and studying I felt like I had

[39:56]
learning and studying I felt like I had
an edge on um when when I kind of pushed

[39:59]
an edge on um when when I kind of pushed

[39:59]
an edge on um when when I kind of pushed
into the poker poker space.

[40:02]
into the poker poker space.

[40:02]
into the poker poker space.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And how does that apply to your

[40:03]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And how does that apply to your

[40:03]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And how does that apply to your
studying now? Do you feel like you're

[40:05]
studying now? Do you feel like you're

[40:05]
studying now? Do you feel like you're
someone who can do these kind of longer

[40:06]
someone who can do these kind of longer

[40:06]
someone who can do these kind of longer
deep studies that you feel like maybe

[40:08]
deep studies that you feel like maybe

[40:08]
deep studies that you feel like maybe
other players struggle with and how do

[40:10]
other players struggle with and how do

[40:10]
other players struggle with and how do
you apply that kind of engineering

[40:11]
you apply that kind of engineering

[40:11]
you apply that kind of engineering
structure to your learning pocket?

[40:14]
structure to your learning pocket?

[40:14]
structure to your learning pocket?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that the nice thing for me

[40:16]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that the nice thing for me

[40:16]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that the nice thing for me
is that I just I love studying but like

[40:18]
is that I just I love studying but like

[40:18]
is that I just I love studying but like
I love the game playing it. I love but

[40:21]
I love the game playing it. I love but

[40:21]
I love the game playing it. I love but
really like a big issue that I had early

[40:23]
really like a big issue that I had early

[40:23]
really like a big issue that I had early
on is that I wanted to study. I just I

[40:25]
on is that I wanted to study. I just I

[40:25]
on is that I wanted to study. I just I
didn't really want to go grind. I just

[40:27]
didn't really want to go grind. I just

[40:27]
didn't really want to go grind. I just
wanted to study more. And so I just I

[40:28]
wanted to study more. And so I just I

[40:28]
wanted to study more. And so I just I
really enjoyed that part of the game. It

[40:30]
really enjoyed that part of the game. It

[40:30]
really enjoyed that part of the game. It
never felt hard. um it never felt like I

[40:33]
never felt hard. um it never felt like I

[40:33]
never felt hard. um it never felt like I
was having to work hard, you know what I

[40:35]
was having to work hard, you know what I

[40:35]
was having to work hard, you know what I
mean? And I just enjoyed it. So, I think

[40:37]
mean? And I just enjoyed it. So, I think

[40:37]
mean? And I just enjoyed it. So, I think
that um the structuring things like

[40:40]
that um the structuring things like

[40:40]
that um the structuring things like
adding intensity into study, it helps.

[40:42]
adding intensity into study, it helps.

[40:42]
adding intensity into study, it helps.
But, but overall, I just I just enjoy

[40:44]
But, but overall, I just I just enjoy

[40:44]
But, but overall, I just I just enjoy
learning about the game and learning

[40:46]
learning about the game and learning

[40:46]
learning about the game and learning
about all the nuances, mechanics, and

[40:48]
about all the nuances, mechanics, and

[40:48]
about all the nuances, mechanics, and
and how sensitive things are and how

[40:50]
and how sensitive things are and how

[40:50]
and how sensitive things are and how
things can change if if it's this player

[40:52]
things can change if if it's this player

[40:52]
things can change if if it's this player
versus this player. And I love that

[40:53]
versus this player. And I love that

[40:53]
versus this player. And I love that
stuff. So, I think that um I I think it

[40:56]
stuff. So, I think that um I I think it

[40:56]
stuff. So, I think that um I I think it
helped me with with engineering, but I

[40:57]
helped me with with engineering, but I

[40:57]
helped me with with engineering, but I
think if you don't really enjoy what

[40:59]
think if you don't really enjoy what

[40:59]
think if you don't really enjoy what
you're learning, it's going to feel more

[41:01]
you're learning, it's going to feel more

[41:01]
you're learning, it's going to feel more
grindy, right? Like no matter what the

[41:03]
grindy, right? Like no matter what the

[41:03]
grindy, right? Like no matter what the
subject is, like engineering definitely

[41:04]
subject is, like engineering definitely

[41:04]
subject is, like engineering definitely
felt way more grindy than than studying

[41:07]
felt way more grindy than than studying

[41:07]
felt way more grindy than than studying
poker for 40 hours or whatever.

[41:10]
poker for 40 hours or whatever.

[41:10]
poker for 40 hours or whatever.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can imagine coming from your

[41:11]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can imagine coming from your

[41:11]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can imagine coming from your
engineering background, then you get

[41:13]
engineering background, then you get

[41:13]
engineering background, then you get
into poker, you're like, "Oh my god,

[41:14]
into poker, you're like, "Oh my god,

[41:14]
into poker, you're like, "Oh my god,
this is like so easy to study cuz it's

[41:15]
this is like so easy to study cuz it's

[41:15]
this is like so easy to study cuz it's
so much more fun." But you've already

[41:17]
so much more fun." But you've already

[41:17]
so much more fun." But you've already
shown you can do the hard stuff, you can

[41:19]
shown you can do the hard stuff, you can

that jump out big and and um I learned a

[1:23:29]
that jump out big and and um I learned a

[1:23:29]
that jump out big and and um I learned a
lot through those experiences.

[1:23:31]
lot through those experiences.

[1:23:31]
lot through those experiences.
&gt;&gt; It's funny. Yeah, because like they now

[1:23:33]
&gt;&gt; It's funny. Yeah, because like they now

[1:23:33]
&gt;&gt; It's funny. Yeah, because like they now
kind of for example play higher so the

[1:23:34]
kind of for example play higher so the

[1:23:34]
kind of for example play higher so the
field is softer, but then like the

[1:23:37]
field is softer, but then like the

field is softer, but then like the
challenge is not necessarily your

[1:23:39]
challenge is not necessarily your

[1:23:39]
challenge is not necessarily your
opponents, but then now the challenge

[1:23:41]

try to build it. And I think that once I

blind calling range and I would build

[1:48:02]
blind calling range and I would build

the range and I would randomize flops

[1:48:04]
the range and I would randomize flops

[1:48:04]
the range and I would randomize flops
and I would see if on all flops I had

good board coverage. So that's like this

[1:48:08]
good board coverage. So that's like this

outside of America I would say for the

[2:48:33]
outside of America I would say for the

[2:48:33]
outside of America I would say for the
most part.

[2:48:35]
most part.

[2:48:35]
most part.
So, that's going to be a little bit

[2:48:36]
So, that's going to be a little bit

[2:48:36]
So, that's going to be a little bit
interesting to see how that is affected.

[2:48:40]
interesting to see how that is affected.

[2:48:40]
interesting to see how that is affected.
Um, and then America, I think that

[2:48:43]
Um, and then America, I think that

25ks in America, but I think that in

[2:49:00]
25ks in America, but I think that in

[2:49:00]
25ks in America, but I think that in
general,

[2:49:02]
general,

[2:49:02]
general,
as Americans, we might just be playing a

[2:49:04]
as Americans, we might just be playing a

[2:49:04]
as Americans, we might just be playing a
much lower ABI in the States, and then

[2:49:07]
much lower ABI in the States, and then

[2:49:07]
much lower ABI in the States, and then
you you go to Macau or maybe Dubai in

where the super high roller action just

[2:49:13]
where the super high roller action just

[2:49:13]
where the super high roller action just
is. I think it's it's really tough to

[2:49:15]
is. I think it's it's really tough to

[2:49:15]
is. I think it's it's really tough to
run eight really good 100ks a year. Um,

[2:49:19]
run eight really good 100ks a year. Um,

[2:49:19]
run eight really good 100ks a year. Um,
and I think that it seems like we're

[2:49:21]
and I think that it seems like we're

[2:49:21]
and I think that it seems like we're
kind of moving into a direction where

[2:49:24]
kind of moving into a direction where

[2:49:24]
kind of moving into a direction where
the best 100ks are just going to be at

[2:49:26]
the best 100ks are just going to be at

the best 100ks are just going to be at
Triton. uh wherever they decide to to

[2:49:28]
Triton. uh wherever they decide to to

run. And so we might end up, you know,

[2:49:30]
run. And so we might end up, you know,

having that I think does make a

[2:50:44]
having that I think does make a

[2:50:44]
having that I think does make a
difference. But skill sets just start to

[2:50:47]
difference. But skill sets just start to

[2:50:47]
difference. But skill sets just start to
shift and that's where I think that like

[2:50:49]
shift and that's where I think that like

[2:50:49]
shift and that's where I think that like
it kind of gets it kind of comes back

is just so much different than big blind

Annie. When you play three-handed with a

[2:51:03]
Annie. When you play three-handed with a

[2:51:03]
Annie. When you play three-handed with a
big blind Annie that the game is

[2:51:04]
big blind Annie that the game is

[2:51:04]
big blind Annie that the game is
completely different. And so I think

[2:51:06]
completely different. And so I think

[2:51:06]
completely different. And so I think
that like the way that I feel is that

[2:51:08]
that like the way that I feel is that

[2:51:08]
that like the way that I feel is that
maybe the American guys might just be

maybe the American guys might just be
sharper live because I'm not focused on

[2:51:12]
sharper live because I'm not focused on

[2:51:12]
sharper live because I'm not focused on

5kg PKO. And so I think that yeah, part

[2:51:24]
5kg PKO. And so I think that yeah, part
of that like claws at me a little bit in

of that like claws at me a little bit in

[2:51:27]
of that like claws at me a little bit in
