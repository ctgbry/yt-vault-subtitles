boys and girls
little 10 20 just to jump big straight
back in it
okay

[01:00]
okay
welcome to the table mr wacko thank you
very much i'll start off with a little
three bet
can we just get it in first hand
one time
this first hand he's like okay weka
starts with three but i started with a
four bed you know old school poker just
setting the tone no no it's not he's

[01:17]
setting the tone no no it's not he's
just playing ranges just playing ranges
you know in the past the best pokemon
service were fun they were like really
and the three of me the first button i
don't care which hand i have i'm just
gonna throw a little first four bet you
know get like this kind of dynamics
going on nowadays it's just like i have

[01:31]
going on nowadays it's just like i have
my set ranges and i play them
regardless if you three bet the first
hand or the last hand
and give a [ __ ] i flopped an open ended
with the pocket sevens
ah
guys
how often do motherboards

[01:47]
how often do motherboards
uh occur
from what from what i understood it's
like less than ten percent right or
exactly 10
something like that
i think it's just my brain extra
focusing on us every time i talk about

[02:00]
focusing on us every time i talk about
uh
these boards right that uh
find them quite complicated
i do think i should be checking again
you could also make a small delay but i
think he's just gonna because the board
is mono he's just gonna be checking way

[02:15]
is mono he's just gonna be checking way
more 8x and 9x then otherwise i think in
the river have easy call because me can
bet the same hand
or can bluff back four and here
[Music]
i'm gonna start off with it

[02:31]
we rolled quite high
king seven is king seven and open uh
another standard open okay he leads

[02:47]
i had
i don't wanna have a heart and i would
have a different king i would definitely
race but i think this king i will just
call
yes we're blocking 10 seven suited but
or let's say for example the 8th parrot
i would definitely also race

[03:00]
i would definitely also race
because then
he will
open king 8 more frequently
if he checks i think i'm just going to
check behind
am i known

[03:27]
thank you very much sir
give it to me baby

[03:34]
what the [ __ ]
because basically when i stab in
position especially for a bigger sizing
i'm basically saying i have a very good
hand or have a very bad hand
so let's say he has a value hand

[03:47]
so let's say he has a value hand
i mean yeah he ek he can check raise
but you know
what's going to happen
i i fold my bad hands he called my good
hands and my good answer would have

[04:00]
hands and my good answer would have
barrelled the turn anyway so basically
all it's doing is making me feel my bad
hands making me continue my
my good hand so basically
what i'm saying is due to the way i
construct my range there's no value to
be gained by check raising
okay

[04:16]
okay
now that's a tip that we can work with
weko thank you very much for this clear
explanation
here we made a little c-bet with top set
and
a duka
figured it was time to put some pressure

[04:32]
figured it was time to put some pressure
and we're now in a reasonably tough turn
spot with our range versus the bigger
size especially because we can have like
some overpairs and stuff
but obviously with our exact hand we
have an easy call

[04:45]
and we have the eight of spades which is
very good
actually it doesn't really matter
it's actually very bad river
blocks

[05:09]
close

[05:57]
i'm gonna go for a small video on the
river with the four

[06:02]
i had a better eight that was just that
big but i think this hand
just like pocket deuces i think are fine
hands to
throwing your small bat deuces obviously
cannot re-raise

[06:16]
cannot re-raise
eight four can now just call sometimes
he has wars and sometimes we juice the
bluff
yeah play as king jack
we're a bit deeper here with the ac4
it's quite a good board for us to dunk
on

[06:32]
but this hand is quite funky
but hey
beating funky
roller 51 off the

[06:46]
time now i think we should be picky we
don't have any equity so let's say we
had ace for diamond or something at
least blocking like h9 suited and some
a7 suited for for
what it's worth

[07:00]
what it's worth
i guess that would be okay obviously
blocking aces is is a is something nice
but obviously the lead is
quite funky but i think

[07:15]
like the thing is if you have a hand
like king jack or something
yes you know you have a bit more
potential
but in the same time
you're also blocking a lot of his fault

[07:30]
you're also blocking a lot of his fault
so at least with an ace you're blocking
like some calls
mainly in aces
and you're unblocking like king jack
type of falling skin queen
he decided not to block the river
probably at ace king
no actually a good check back by him

[07:45]
no actually a good check back by him
because i would not have followed the
river
yet king jack
look at that
it's a little bit that chicken i would
say
[Music]

[08:00]
[Music]
draw a little donkey donkey
and this is the turn
i'm gonna try a little over bed now
we have an easy give up on the blank and
the easy bluff on a spade so that makes

[08:15]
the easy bluff on a spade so that makes
it
an easy spot
i know a lot of people are thinking
you [ __ ] dunk you do it again i
remember in a video before i've told you

[08:30]
remember in a video before i've told you
to not dunk why do you do that why do
you do that so dumb
you check back here jack 6 suited which
is quite a loose open from the cutoff

[08:54]
let me know we forbaded the
the queens and he's thinking about if he

[09:00]
the queens and he's thinking about if he
wants to ship his stacking which is a
very good idea very good idea bien can
eve thank you very much

[09:15]
little trivet here with five six suited
one of my favorite handsome poker
and this is why they should just flop
apparently back door
this is how we do it
also some 1020 started

[09:31]
also some 1020 started
they got it in in quite a funky way
and we turn beautiful with five six
checks

[09:47]
or actually quite a low number actually
i don't mind checking this sometimes
especially turning a six like a deuces
or something i would definitely bet but
i think this is a finite to check
occasionally

[10:02]
the bad river

[10:17]
obviously you have an easy call
yeah pocket aces okay yeah and then the
check back we lost a lot of volume pay
attention guys we are giving away over
10k dollar worth of free prizes in our

[10:31]
10k dollar worth of free prizes in our
poker ambition academy including a free
license to our mechanics of poker
program
so what are you waiting for join our
weekly interactive webinars at the poker
ambition academy did i see someone
asking for playlist

[10:47]
asking for playlist
i have to actually sit down and remove a
bunch of songs
because i'm apparently reached the limit
of 200 songs
because i was adding new songs and i
came to the conclusion at some point
that they weren't being added and that
kind of sucks

[11:22]
that's some failure with the ace king
he also had an ace and now we have no
okay that's four we have two aces

[11:31]
okay that's four we have two aces
we get a walk that's actually very
likely when you have aces
that's you know very unlikely that other
people have hands that they want to play
with because you know how it goes right
the ace is the boss
that doesn't run

[11:46]
that doesn't run
and dutch we say ass boss
this spot is quite annoying here
this is any other sizing in the guys a
little bit crazy in the head a bit

[12:01]
little bit crazy in the head a bit
cuckoo
but i'm not happy
but it's cucunas
already their first cucumbers it's
actually a thing this cooking has made
me call

[12:16]
that's what they call a good turn
there's a barrel
definitely gonna have some raises on the
turn
i think

[12:31]
actually i think this is a fine hand to
do it with
and we throw a little donkey donkey

[12:45]
and we throw a little donkey donkey
again okay
you [ __ ] dunk you do it again i
remember in a video before i've told you
to not dunk why do you do that why do
you do that
i'm gonna proceed by

[13:04]
depends on how light he is
see
checking

[13:18]
his half bolt really looks like whatever
the hand is worth yeah and that was
quite interesting right because the
river was a high card and
i didn't like if if the flop was a queen
and the river was in jack i think we can
just read him on

[13:31]
just read him on
[Music]
having a jack quite easily
but now because it was the opposite it
was a bit confusing
also if you look at it i'm gonna have a
lot of under pairs right love fourth
pairs fifth pairs so i figured that
maybe he would just use this size as a

[13:46]
maybe he would just use this size as a
bluff with like king axe
i think king eight or something would be
a king eight off suit for example he's
an okay candidate and then like some
suited kings
maybe

[14:01]
also a hand like a6
so i think
especially if those combinations start
to get off suit i think we have these
don't
yeah that's your little seven deuce
seven dudes never lose
ah any faults

[14:16]
ah any faults
i just show them drunken style and i
think it's good for poker like bring
some fun enjoyment all the three but
here with the ace jackman flop top two
just considered
good hand
our left head's up here

[14:36]
i call with the h jack
i'm just gonna let him do his thing

[14:52]
oh i have to be careful sometimes i get
i've changed this before you know what
i'm excited with a good hand obviously
there's still a lot of shitty rivers but

[15:00]
there's still a lot of shitty rivers but
that's not gonna happen two sell
diamonds that's how we run
five perfectly fine as well let's use
five four of spades and got funky
but other than that we should be good
guys we should be good to win stacks

[15:16]
guys we should be good to win stacks
or lose this one i'm gonna kill someone
i don't actually see how am i gonna lose
this one only jax
blockers just blockers

[15:31]
blockers just blockers
how it goes
he had a bunch of blockers and decided
to go with it
very few people are strong enough
to bet it twice after they've been
called
well this guy did my friend kevin this

[15:46]
well this guy did my friend kevin this
guy did [ __ ] hit asif
gets dirty okay let's make the dia
silver

[16:07]
actually i wouldn't
a skin i would
i think i would check i'm not really
sure if ace is a better check than ace
king i'm really sure

[16:16]
king i'm really sure
i'm not really sure

[16:41]
review that one later aces here we got a
call from king queen

[16:47]
quite a freaky call in my opinion
but hey he's the silver guy not me

[18:12]
that's uh cooler my friend i'm very
sorry i'm gonna go for a little cold for

[18:16]
sorry i'm gonna go for a little cold for
bed here
it could be tilted
let's take that in consideration plop we
can do various things but

[18:31]
can do various things but
probably not going anywhere
we can check
but actually i think he's not really
gonna have a folding range on the flop
the way he's currently playing so i'm
just gonna start it with a small bat
and if he raises i think i'm just gonna
rip it in

[18:57]
and oprah up against the draw

[19:00]
and oprah up against the draw
hope that he sometimes race folds a
better hand
hoping that
he has a bluff
sometimes it's just going to be very
hard to play turns so that's why i think
jamming is better

[19:15]
and we get sometimes called by words
right different races they race
sometimes like jack 9 or 6 7 or jack
queen
they have middle pair and he actually
thought about it so that's good oh we
turned an ace that's good
we're running good guys we're running
good yes yes yes we're running very good

[19:31]
good yes yes yes we're running very good
yes me like even liking me nike that was
unfortunate for mr kogai
but you know against his value range
yeah and we're still gonna have what do
we have 25 percent
i think like i said my player i think is

[19:46]
i think like i said my player i think is
fine
this hand i think we can do various
things don't mind check raising don't
mind check calling
i think actually this is a bit too loose

[20:03]
takes five i think is a fine check race
obviously i would never check race 67
without
diamonds

[20:15]
turn
i think
when we already enter
a line that's a bit too loose possibly
i think i'm just gonna

[20:32]
let this one go

[21:03]
but you know i think we have some good
direct fault equity on the flop let's
say yes and like 108 offset or something
any faults that's
would say an okay result
then we sometimes win

[21:15]
then we sometimes win
did i take that in consideration
he gave up hey
