further Ado let's hop in today's episode
with
sergy all right there he is sergy sergy
thanks for coming on the pot thanks for
remind me guys Ser is not a big surprise
as it's been a trend with players that
we have had on but I saw that you are a
very competitive person you competed in
gaming competitions playing runscape I
had to Google that to be honest but it
seems like an online multiplayer role
playing game if I understood correctly
uh and when you play sports like table
tennis badminton or just rock climbing
by yourself you are competing with how
well you've climbed before so you're
very competitive in I guess everything
you do that always makes me ask the
question where does this drive to
compete in everything you do come from
and how does competing make you feel hey
that's a great question I think it's
always a mix of factors like your um
genetics your genes and the way you were
fostered in a childhood plus the
experience that you've had in your
childhood usually what makes you know
the most competitive people competitive
um are some hardships that they had to
deal with I think in the childhood and
not tra
specifically but maybe some things that
you know made them feel the toughness of
this life on the early
stage so for you what kind of experience
stands out I wouldn't say that there was
anything um precisely you know traumatic
or maybe it was not the best word to use
but I I'd say uh maybe being raised in a
discipline my father served in military
for like 25 years so he was like not
very strict to me but I always always
you know learned what the discipline is
from the early on and then you know
growing up in Ukraine
um spending a lot of time on the street
with your friends and sometimes not
friends you get some kind of experience
early on you get to stand your ground
you're like okay it's either I'm at the
top or I get run over well maybe not
exactly like that but yeah the notion is
similar I think it's also common uh that
for example do you have any any siblings
because like let's say for example
you're the youngest of like four or
something you have like a natural more
need to to compete because you're always
competing with your with your older
brothers do you maybe have any siblings
that you were competing
with actually not I don't have any
brothers only cousins and yeah so
nothing nothing of that sort I think it
was more like of parents telling you
like come on why why aren't you studying
better look at X look at y you could
have done better get your stuff together
man it's time to show some class and
stuff studying was maybe uh I think many
poker players theyve tried some studying
but usually it was not really their path
you then got very hooked into gaming you
even mentioned that you were competing
in like Clans and stuff like that could
you tell us a little bit about your
let's say runscape career you can call
oh yeah those were the fun times I hope
some people who watch this podcast or
listen to it have played it before
because I met I met a few people
recently actually in Port even in
Portugal who were of my ede and who
played this game as well 10 what was it
15 years ago 20 years ago time passed on
Fast and everyone who played this game
has some really you know deep Nostalgia
about it it's a game where you get your
character you you have to train strength
agility whatever and then you have other
people playing so you get your friends
online then you you unite into Clans and
then you start fighting other clans you
get the sense of community um yeah it
was great great
times what did uh like your experience
in competing in in this game or in
various competitions what did that teach
you that possibly gave you an Adge when
you switched into
poker I think few uh there are a few
components that that I view important
one of them is um to learn to lose learn
how to lose on the early stage of your
life uh like when you're shown your
place when when your ego does not get
too big and if you if you persist if you
try to overcome these
hardships if you try to like each time
you lose you get your stuff together and
then come back and yeah pretty much you
get trained you know maybe in some
artificial Way by doing it online but
still you get you even get some
managerial skills because you know it
was like a clan of 25 peoples people I
was at that time um 18 maybe so it
lasted from like 14 years to maybe 18 or
19 years and at that time I remember
being you know having some high rank in
a clan and we had like 25 people from
all over the world we had some guy who
was a policeman in Miami who was in his
30s and you like very very different
types of people some young Gamers from
New Zealand whatever and then we would
just gather on a team speak or WIA and
then go and fight other guys it was so
much fun mean I guess a very big
difference that stands out to me is yeah
you are working in a in a clan you said
25 people poker is a bit more individual
have you always tried to work in a team
even in poker maybe also due to your
experience in gaming maybe it was
positive or negative you can elaborate
on that or were you more of like a a
Solo solo grinder and always did
everything
yourself that's a cool question actually
if we rewind back on my pocker career I
would I have always been working with
somebody um the only periods when I
would work 99% by myself where maybe the
last um half maybe yeah maybe last half
of the year of my career and before that
I would always work with other people I
found a lot of joy and a lot of
opportunity to grow when you when you
work with like-minded people especially
those who have slightly different play
um style than you you can learn a lot
from them but uh it's actually not that
easy to find a person um who is
approximately on the same level who's
not like a coach to you and not somebody
who plays lower and then you get this
some symbiosis when both of you can
learn something from each other do you
guys think it is something rare was it
hard for you to find such people I mean
the the biggest dilemma in poker is that
if you find that sweet spot they're
usually the guys sitting across to you
at the table right uh I've I've worked
with many players as well throughout my
career I definitely um I definitely
agree with that it makes it a lot more
enjoyable you get different perspective
it just also helps your growth we kind
of had the rule that or at least rule
let's say for example I would play
against a good buddy of mine that I do a
lot of strategy with if I would be
exploiting in on certain areas that I'm
sure it gives me an edge over him and I
don't think it's something that
necessarily will cost him a lot of money
versus the population so it's just a
leak that I can exploit but I don't
think a lot of people will exploit him
on that I would keep it to myself but I
think it's just a fundamental leak in
his game that's just costing him a lot
of money that's why I would say hey man
maybe you should change this in your
game because I think this is going to
cost you a lot of money it was kind of
the rude that I had I don't know Adam do
you have maybe some similar similar
experience well I was playing heads up
so I was never across the tables to my
friends uh but yeah I can definitely
relate to being around like-minded
people uh ideally you want to have kind
of people who you like off the tables as
well I know you can have just study
partners for pokerup specifically but it
does help a lot if you're spend a lot of
time with people that you gel well as
personalities you bring other things to
the table it's one of those things like
when you find the right people it's like
you said that Synergy just exists where
you learn from each other in a really
cohesive way but people who haven't
found those it's sometimes hard to give
advice on how do you find that kind of
right person to help you on your journey
but yeah it sounds like for you you
found right the right people at the
right times so yeah something that
worked out well for you was there
something that you actively did Sergio
did you actively reach out to certain
people to to work with or they sort of
magically arrived on your path that's a
great question actually and maybe you
know uh listeners of this podcast could
take away some ideas from this because
um I did not have any intention as I
started my blog on the biggest Russians
speaking poker forums that had you know
people from all over the ex Soviet
republics Russia Ukraine Belarus malova
Kazakhstan whatever so quite a big
community and I just I've started a Blog
uh just for myself to to be more
disciplined to post some hands and with
the
time um there was this effect of people
reading it and then like messaging me
asking like hey man let's you know want
to disc cast some hands together in
Skype and then we would do that and that
way I think I found many people who'
become my friends some of them become my
mentors like in a kind kind of mentors
so I think that you know BL having a
blog or maybe a YouTube channel like now
is a way to express yourself to show
what you are like so then if people
like-minded people to call them I think
is the right word they will just try to
connect with you and it gives you a lot
of opportunities to find new friendships
and
Partnerships yeah I think like in the
past it used to be forums right I I
shared this as well I remember I was on
a Dutch Forum last members because you
know Soviet is a little bit bigger than
the Netherlands but I remember at some
point I just messaged literally everyone
on the Forum that was sort of active
like hey you know I I've recorded my
session do you want to go over it
together stuff like that I reached out
to everyone and remember a couple
applied those actually turned out to
also later be be good poker friends of
mine they all had successful poker R I'm
not saying that if you responded to my
message it automatically means you have
a good successful poker career but at
least you know they were also open for
it they jumped on a call with me and we
did that with other players as well so
we kind of formed form the little group
there and I think that is super
beneficial in the past it was forums
nowadays I guess you give a good example
it's it's just a matter of trying to put
yourself out there so people can
actually reach you for example YouTube
for example Instagram nowadays right
social Medias that were not as popular I
think when we both uh when we both yeah
start started to get into poker what
first attracted you so you were you were
playing these uh um you play you were
playing runscape how did you make the
transition to Poker when did you get in
touch with poker and what kind of
attracted you towards the
game I think it was on the first um year
of my university in Kiev one of my
friends just um had introduced me to the
this game explain me the rules I've
tried playing the first game I was like
what the hell this game is I don't get
it you have to Blu like what I don't
like it and then uh I was just I was
just you know doing my stuff studying
and then he would message me like Hey
we're coming to play this offline pocker
you want to play it costed like what $2
to enroll in a free roll and then you
can exchange that you know you get cheap
for the $2 and then you can get a beer
for example and then you have to play a
field of 50 people maybe and then the
first place get some like
$70 so in between my studies I've
started playing in those games it took
maybe two weeks um of the offline
tournaments to win to actually get the
first place and I was like a total dunk
not understanding anything but you know
the competition was the same so I I won
plus the variance we all know the
variant and then um I won $70 and that
was a lot to me by that time my uh in in
in the University I would get like $70 a
month um because I was studying on a I
don't know if you have that in
Netherlands uh how do you call it like
when you get it's like a it's like a
student contribution or something from
the government you mean yeah like a very
small student contribution but still
enough for a student anyways so I won
that and I thought like all right so why
am I studying maybe I should try
something else and then I've started
playing offline games um and it was
quite easy because you could play a very
tight play and on a low on the low
stakes I think the buying if we
converted into Dollars was like10 NL 10
nl1 probably
$10 and people would just drink you know
have fun talk so you can play a very
nitty strategy and still end up making
money so that was my transition to
pocker that was that like the first so
was that like the first type of strategy
that you learned and how did you how how
did you get how did you learn that
strategy did you go did you read a book
did you go online be like hey you know
because in the beginning when you play
poker you might be like well this is
just luck you know you need to get good
cards when was like the first time that
you realized oh wait there's actually a
strategy to this that you started to
implement so I was discussing the
strategy with my friends at that time
because we all were playing how to play
you know this offline NY bum hunts type
of pocker but then at some point and
I've started making quite a good money
maybe like 5x 6X to my you know student
salary and at some point I've thought
like this is not serious if I want to
make real money I have to transition
online and that's when I've uh found
about pocker strategy started reading
all the Articles and then I've pretty
much downloaded a and printed everything
that I've could and whenever I would go
to university in a bus I would just get
the those notes start reading them
thinking about pocker thinking about
poer during the uh lessons in the
University pretty much like that do you
remember any like first uh big
strategical aha moments where you're
like
oh that's how it works that you're like
you know like for example if I talk
about my experience they were like I
remember I think I think they called it
the freeze play if I'm not mistaken
where you raise the turn and they would
never come over the top they would just
call and then you you could always just
check behind the river so was like or on
the Flop kind of same play you you
freeze the action and they would always
call you could check behind the next
street so it's like cheap Showdown and I
started to implement that and and need
it sort of it sort of worked I was like
oh wow so actually because I do this you
do that and that has like a strategical
consequence that kind of got my brain
thinking in a whole different direction
like wait my actions have consequences
to how you react and that can either be
positive for me or negative for me did
you have any like similar experience
that stands out to you
I would not call it an AA moment but it
was quite fun I don't know if you guys
have it in English poer world uh when
it's called the yeti theorum if somebody
three bets like uh when you raise on a
dry board and if somebody three bets on
a dry board it basically means that he
never has a hand and he's always
bluffing especially if the board is dry
you know like a I mean A7 D whatever
Queen 85 no flash Jo so yeah I was like
hm three bet so let's shove and stuff
was working at least
sometimes but when you start to
implement that did did they then also
send your brain in the direction of like
oh wait if this is possible what's like
what's like the next how do you call it
Yeti Yeti play Yeti theum I don't know
why the hell it's called like that I
don't know I still remember the first
time I heard about
it yeah would be fun if I mispronounced
it but 99% it was called ye etherum yeah
another I've just I've just recalled um
if somebody raises you in a three B pot
on a monotone board he almost never he
is almost never bluffing and it was way
back before this strategy of 10% seats
like when people used to cat half pot or
when third and then if the color in
position raises then you like think
about it okay if he's bluffing what is
he what what is he bluffing with the
only possible hand is like Ace x with
Ace of a suit and especially if you hold
that hand and uh then you pretty much
cut off his Bluffs or if you have some
overpay then you will flip which would
be the best scenario for you or you are
just drone dead if you have no suit so
that's another thing I remember so these
were like your first kind of encounters
with Equity of the bluffing range and I
guess a little bit psychology of while
people don't fast play dry boards
because why would they right the board
doesn't look scary so the more scary the
board the more the more people fast play
it's still true true to some degree you
know if you think about psychology
nowadays uh but yeah back then it was uh
was it was definitely enhanced uh did
you have any you you mentioned that you
noticed that hey wait online I can make
more money than offline people can be a
little bit scared when they go from
offline to online poker did you have any
like role models that you could look up
to or people that have shown you the way
of like oh wait actually in online poker
you can make a lot of money let's do
this or were you just naturally very
confident in
yourself that's another great question
thank you for that because uh it was a
very important moment that actually led
me to transition to online um the blogs
on pocker strategy of some pretty
well-known players like inner inner
psycho inner P I think streamer on GG I
remember reading his blog and I was like
wow he's posting these graphs he's
winning a lot of money like pocker
should be real because these people must
be real and and then there some other
players I don't remember their nicknames
I mean for Haley for sure uh especially
asking about the role model for haly was
always a role model model for me uh I
remember reading his blog during the
times when I had the the worst times in
poker like not being able to get past an
L 100 and then like getting this
inspiration by seeing somebody who has
gone through that already who has dealt
with all the possible hardship ships
with all those 30 bins down swing in a
few day sessions so it was a huge boost
and one of the reasons why I did uh you
know um not Prevail but continued to
climb up so basically he showed you that
it was actually possible despite you
know encountering certain hardship like
like down swings didn't that maybe
because it can it can on one side give
you inspiration but let's say you
haven't started and you're reading this
blog here oh my God this guy's losing a
lot of money you know it's very hard for
him hard for him mentally like some
people would have the response to that
like hey I'm out I'll go get a normal
job but you were you were I guess it
triggered some something else in you so
where did the because like someone else
can do it but then where does the belief
come from that you could do it as well
as it does it have something to do with
your your background in succeeding in
gaming for
example I wouldn't say that I've like
100% believed in myself to me the most
important question was is it even
possible to make money playing online
pocker and if those people did not have
their blogs I don't even know if I would
try playing online because how would I
know that online pocker is not like full
of cheaters if it's not dead if it's not
full of bots because when you play
offline and some people talk they're
like H online pocker is 100% of Boss
believe me I know somebody from there
and yeah I mean it was one of the
decisive factors of my transition
so when you when you decide to go play
poker for a living and you and you share
that with your surroundings you know for
example your parents usually people you
know they're usually not jumping
straight in the boat with you like go
sah yes online gambling why not great
idea I think you had a similar
experience with your parents but then I
think you mentioned you showed them a
graph of 75k hands on 10l and you
explain them the concept of variance now
I'm sure there's some people listening
here that are like ah I've been trying
to convince my my parents that poker is
a good idea how the hell did you
convince your parents that poker was a
good idea and how did you explain
variant to them that it actually made
them click so I explained it the exactly
same way I've understood what the
variance is during the school when I was
like what 10 or 12 years old we had this
lesson math lesson about the um theory
of possibility and the teacher told us
like if if you TOS coin 100 times you'll
get 50 um heads and 50 Tails almost 50%
with some uh deviation and I was like oh
yeah sure why would that happen and then
during the break I would actually toss
the coin and I would get something like
47 to 53 and I was like wow this stuff
actually works so this is how the life
works and then I've just explained this
idea to my parents and then I said said
okay imagine that instead of a coin you
toss like a triangle that has three
sides or something more um complex that
has like six sides and the possibility
it works the same way there is a chance
of getting each side every time so this
is how poker works you playing this game
when you don't see the cards of your
opponent and you make these assumptions
and then you just TOS the coins that
have six size or more or less whatever
you count This Ss and this is the math
and here's my graph so please take me as
I am I see
uh I see a commercial opportunity here
you bringing out like a coin with six s
side for people to explain variants to
their to their parents and loved ones
that don't support their poker careers
what do you think
sure where like like when you started
out what were like some of your goals in
poker and your expectations like how did
that um yeah what were kind of your
thoughts around that when you started
out oh well I think I I've tried all the
possible you know goal settings
strategies and uh directions to move and
things to believe in while doing that
the first one was monetary for sure I
just wanted to make some money because I
come not from a rich family and you know
we've spent like 10 years uh living in a
one bedroom apartment with my parents
with a r in a rented department so I
kind of always had the desire to make
money you know to get not rich let's
call it wealthy it's a more correct way
to be able to satisfy my needs and to
have a freedom because this is one of
the most important things for me in my
life so from the mo first goal it was
purely monetary and I remember playing
l25 having some hardships and I thought
like okay this game has so much stress
so much variance all I want is just to
make $3,000 per month or or what for an
l25 I think it was less like maybe $750
something like that and then it would be
fine for me I can relax and then just
play this game and study and once I
complete my study I'll do something else
but then uh while climbing up the stakes
making more money and then at some point
I've started making more money they than
I actually wanted and I realized
that with you know it's called in
economics it's called the marginal
utility I think the best way to explain
it if you if you're hungry you eat one
cake you feel 10 out of 10 satisfaction
but if you eat five or six with each new
cake you feel less and less and then
it's becomes negative so I think the
same concept is applicable to money and
after reaching some point it doesn't
really make your life happier or doesn't
make you more free so I've had this
moments of understanding that if I keep
motivating Myself by by the money only I
will not move forward and it doesn't
motivate me it doesn't make me tick
anymore did you also maybe have the
experience that let's say for example
your goal is to set out and win 750
bucks did you ever have a month where
like oh the first weekend I ran hot won
750 bucks I don't have to play for the
rest of the
month I no I can't recall that I think I
would definitely relax and you know get
um complacent and play Wars thinking
that I I became the god of pocker until
uh I was Prov that I'm so far from it
but I don't remember like not playing
anymore after winning the X
amount do you recall or when was like
the moment in your career where you
decided to go all in on poker you
mentioned I think that you were also
studying when was like the moment where
you reflected on like no okay it's only
going to be poker from now on because
I'm making way too much money playing
this game and I'm enjoying it way too
much so I I think part I would partially
like uh agree with that statement
because uh that M when that moment
happened it wasn't about that I make
enough money it was that I like this
game I really enjoy it so much it was in
2012 I think when I uh have finally
finished my I have graduated and then
I've gotten this free time because while
being a student I couldn't study as much
as I wanted and I always wanted to have
like eight six hours at least per day to
study to play poker and I could do like
two or three so at that point I felt
super happy super free and those times
were some of the best in my
career six hours a day of studying what
does or playing or playing I was
like okay so you could spend six hours
on poker I was going to ask like six
hours of Poker studying early in your
career what what what did you there were
no solvers back then so I was kind of
curious like what what would you spend
six hours of studying on
um Adam do you remember like the first
big success moment in your career where
you're like oh my God no it's gonna be
poker for me [ __ ] [ __ ] everything else
that I'm
doing yeah my story is quite interesting
because I got a oneway flight to
Thailand was pretty broke clubbed up
with some friends to kind of share a
bank roll and my kind of thing was can I
have enough money to support myself
first of all to continue going um that
was kind of the first 3 to six months of
yes I think I can pay the bills yes I
can pay the rent yes I can keep my head
afloat and then once I got past that
phase it was like can I earn money to
kind of set myself up for the future and
for me I was thinking can I get 10K
bankroll and I think it was when I
started playing NL 60 or NL 100s where I
got my bank roll at 10K and I was like
I'm the richest I've ever been this
could maybe work and then that kind of
like opened up H what's next what
opportunities and it created enough
comfort for myself where I could see
myself doing it long term and I stopped
worrying about the kind of day-to-day
bills and started thinking what what
level's next and they kind of looking up
on the progression so it kind of
happened a little bit organically a bit
of survival needs at first and then kind
of got my head of flat and was like wait
a second maybe there's opportunities
here U but yeah I think it's a it's
always interesting to see how people's
Journeys get started and for you sergy
I'm really interested to uh kind of map
out your kind of career path because so
far we've got you graduating from
University doing your economics we've
got you playing nl10 with a bit of a
nitty strategy and I want to map out
your journey all the way to NL 40K so uh
can you talk us through the early
successes you had when you started
moving up the levels how are you
approaching your strategy and poker
overall in terms of progressing in terms
of building your bankroll moving up
levels what was your your approach in
your early
days yeah so as I mentioned I've started
playing online uh using all the free
materials available on pocker strategy
just reading and watching these vs on
demand everything that was available
pretty much reading blogs and it took me
like one year to get TL 100 it wasn't
that hard online um I had pretty decent
win rates from the very beginning but
then I remember not being able to beat
an l00 for a very long time almost maybe
nine months something like that and what
helped me was uh working with a coach
and I found person who who actually met
in real life and we become became
friends after and he kind of gave me
some insights that I could not um notice
could not see could not understand
myself and that had had given me the
Boost to move up to beat that stake
finally and then nl200 starts at the
point when I finish my University I'm
totally free I have from six to eight
hours every day to devote to Poker and
sports and just feel feeling extremely
happy because I hated University I hated
being you know forced to go there and uh
to spend time with tutors who I did not
really respect like I remember remember
my business teacher would tell me like
yo you will graduate and then you can
come and work for $500 a month if you do
everything good in five years you will
have like $11,000 salary and I remember
him himself you know living in a
dormatory I think uh of the university
and I was and I was thinking like
Samsung does not add up like if this is
Success uh I don't want to to to do that
I'm going to try something else and
poker became that something
else so for you you said you got stuck
at NL 100s for nine months so I'm
interested to dive into that a little
bit so what were some of the issues you
were running into and what were you
experiencing I think also you mentioned
in the questionnaire we prepared for you
that psychology and mindset was one of
your weak points coming into poker
specifically so yeah I'm curious to know
during this point when you were
struggling to make things work at NL
hundreds what were some of the things
you were experiencing what were some
some of the obstacles you were trying to
overcome well given your expertise in
Psychology I think you would enjoy this
answer because I say that I'm probably I
have a very bad you know base ground uh
fundamentals psychologically to be a
successful poker player I used to have
you know tilt problems not that I would
break anything but I would make a lot of
spew plays just make a lot of mistakes
uh feel super stressed have some ego
problems like wanted to compete even
though I cannot win Etc and I think I
could defeat those demons only somewhere
in 200 maybe 18 and that's a long
journey seven years I would say that I
couldn't uh deal with my psychological
leaks so that was something that stopped
me a lot because I have some friends who
are very calm by their nature who don't
really tilt who don't really feel anger
when somebody wins they don't take that
[ __ ] personally and I used to and then
they've gotten more successful much
faster so I think that was one of the um
obstacles yeah I think this would be
interesting to dive a bit deeper into so
in terms of the the Tilt in particular
and the ego issues that you were you
were battling how are they showing up at
the tables how is it affecting your
day-to-day grind and also your ability
to to play
higher ah just you know making mistakes
because that [ __ ] won against
you again is he trying to exploit you is
he what he thinks is the best especially
when you lose to somebody who you view
to be a worst player you know like bum
hunters for example people with 42 43
one1 sop only play with the fish and
then they come and then they win some
pots against you and you're like what
the hell poer is not fair and that's one
of the you know Cornerstone mistakes and
cognitive biases that people have like
poker owes you something no it's not it
does not so yeah this is the thing I can
recall very brightly yeah I can relate
like to that in terms of like the
personalization of Everything feels like
it's you versus them in a very like in a
visceral way times and you mentioned
like how you would like label this guy
some people like label someone as a
bully or this guy gets look against me
and you make it like you versus them and
then you almost like battle against them
in a kind of very personal way rather
than just the strategy way and then you
mentioned like kind of the not being
fair aspect as well which I'm sure
everyone can relate to the PO of guards
being against you and how probabilities
just don't feel Fair as a kind of I'm a
good player I deserve to win and when I
don't it creates issues so for you in
terms of you had a long journey to work
through these you mentioned like
2012-ish you were going more full-time
and then 2018 to kind of correct a lot
of these mindset issues it didn't slow
you down too much because you moved up
pretty quickly and pretty high but what
was the things you had to work through
to find some resolution to now you've
got more of a solid mindset what was
some of the the things you had to work
on to remove some of that
personalization and kind of
victimhood um I think it was the
realization of the importance of
psychology at some point because
psychology I mean I would give it easily
50 maybe 40% of your success in pocker
and well almost every everyone if you
ask people like is psychology important
they would say yes but they would you
know understand it logically but but not
on a deep emotional level that would
actually push them to start working on
it because working in your psychological
leaks could be as hard as studying the
solver you need to find a person who you
trust and you need to read a lot of
books on psychology and both are both
both of these things are hard especially
if you spend a lot of your energy on
pocker um I remember when I was grinding
the most I would not have any capacity
any energy to read after those sessions
it was very hard I could only read you
know complicated hard books hard
materials during the days off because uh
yeah had no energy so psychology could
not be overestimated and if you are
starting out playing poker or playing
the lower Stakes it is never late to
find a good psychologist start working
together um or try some books at first
at least Jared tendler both books were
great I've had a lot of insights from
them and then I remember Elliot's raw um
for a game poker I think it's called and
I watched it when I was already um you
know an l2k plus regular and I've
learned some things from there still
like I would say maybe not a lot but um
enough to to have some quality changes
in my play for sure and then working
with some different psychologists online
just trying to fix your demons
yeah I think that's the thing as well
it's making it a a path of learning
growing and evolving with your mindset
overall and as you mentioned a lot of
players either don't put the time into
it or they just don't think it's
important enough to kind of work on
coincide alongside their strategy or
like you said you didn't have the energy
because you were grinding so much that
you didn't have the kind of time or
bandwidth to uh absorb any more kind of
new content so yeah I think it's
understanding like where your leaks are
and how much value you will gain from
improving them it sounds like for you at
some point the pain points of having
these mental game issues started to want
it to be resolved and you realize wait a
second maybe there's a solution to this
I think some people as well can get a
little bit caught up in that this is my
personality this is how I am it's okay
for other people but I'm just one of
those people who gets a bit tilted at
these episodes I think it's
understanding you can always work on
these things they always like the skills
there's tools there's ways of
approaching uh life and poet that can be
upgraded so to speak so it sounds like
for you you did a lot of different
things to uh upgrade your mindset and
psychology overall is anything that
stands out as one thing or thing that
you learned early on that really helped
you anything that you almost like
learned about yourself or how you were
thinking about stuff that was that that
helped you to to move forward well
regarding psychology I would definitely
name Jared tendler's book first the
first one second was not read at the
time when I read the first one and I I
would take notes and actually study them
and then it uh it it's inspired me to
start a diary where I would write all
the psychological mistakes I had every
day and I would have like a few you know
fat Diaries in a couple of years so it
helped a lot for
sure mental hun histories yeah shout out
to jarro tendler I think after probably
15 years he's still got one of the best
mindset poker books around the mental
Game of Poker one and two and I think a
lot of players who haven't delved into
mindsets they see a lot of relatability
to it cuz he talks about mindset set
issues from the context of being a poker
player which is very unique all the
different tilt you experience and most
people who read the book relate go oh I
can relate to that one that one's me I
relate to this issue and the the tools
as you mentioned that kind of that hand
history of mental game issues that come
up and keeping a a log of that even that
process opens up your eyes to all the
things that you're doing wrong that come
from mental game leaks which you might
have thought were strategy leaks so you
just want to seg we now into your rise
So currently got you at 200 NL you
finished your graduation and tell me for
like how you started to go up to the
higher Stakes what was the first of all
what was the drive behind wanting to
play higher and how are you moving up
stakes from yeah 200s all the way to uh
to
5Ks um let's try to break these drives
into a few categories so one of them was
monetary still because after reaching
some level that was totally comfortable
uh you want more you know you get on
this hedonic threadmill when when you
start running the faster you run the
faster after you have to run so at that
point uh I thought like okay I've
satisfied my needs but I want more so
that was one of the drivers another one
was I don't know if you can call it ego
because when you see you know players
who you can outplay you just want to you
just want to win you just want to defeat
them it's not a very good mindset it's a
dark energy dark kind of motivation that
I would call it um you know it makes you
know this is the anger that gives you
the feel it's not it's not good for a
personality in the long run it gives you
a lot of stress a lot of suffering you
know mental suffering as well because
well it's done through the negative
emotions but at the same time it gives
you a lot of energy like it pushes you
to study to wake up every day two three
hours sitting in flopzilla going through
hands because you have to prove that you
can actually beat everyone who you think
you can beat and if you lose it gives
you even more more anger but yeah you
have to pay for that type of approach by
you know feeling not very happy and not
being a very happy person I
think and how is this driving you to
move up Stak so you mentioned the kind
of wanting more financial abundance and
wealth as you categorize for yourself
and then the ego of trying to prove to
yourself to beat other people and kind
of the pros and cons of that kind of
energy how was that driving you to move
forward what were some of the uh early
success you were having as you were
moving up to midst we'll call it say
nl200 to nl1 K any challenges you faced
on those levels and how are you yeah how
are you progressing to to learn the
strategy to beat those
games well the way I've progressed I
remember having a very you know tough
discipline I was living by myself at the
time um and I would have a very strict
schedule when I wake up I I make a
breakfast then I go play a session then
I work X hours then I do some sports and
then I do X hours of theory again and
repeat for like six days every week for
a couple of years plus I think somewhere
at that point I've I I've got interested
in in finances Financial literature I've
stared reading some books understanding
where does the financial Independence
come from I've realized that you know
making few thousand doll a month is good
but what are you going to do when you're
in your 60s and especially if you live
in a country like Ukraine UK when the
government you know not not just Ukraine
like every pretty much uh uh post-soviet
country when you don't get any High
pensions or government would not ever
bail you out if you're broke like if
you're broke good luck boy so I had I
had to think about it uh and ask myself
okay what am I going to do in 20 years
and 30 years if I make few couple th000
a month and then I spend X how am I
going to compound that stuff so I've
realized that there are some you know
financial goals to be achieved and then
I've said them i' I've written them on a
paper and started moving towards them
plus enjoying the game at the same time
having a lot of passion in it but at the
same time having some moments of like
hating this game wanting to quit I think
I quit pocker two or three times during
my career so now is the third time as a
player why was that what caused you to
quit well uh the first time I quit I
remember it was 20 it was the end of
2017 and that year was hard for me
because I I forced myself too much way
too much I would work a lot like study a
lot play a lot and it did not bring me
happiness and my playing style it was
more about a a very good game selection
not R Waring at that at that time at all
and just trying you know to to make
money so pretty much money was my only
was the only motivator at that time I
did not feel a lot of competitiveness
because if you look at the pocker career
it's it's not like it is the same or the
stable all the time sometimes you want
to compete sometimes you don't sometimes
you want to make more money sometimes
you don't care about money so uh I
remember at least the half the second
half of
2017 every morning would start to me the
same way I would wake up at 5:00 a.m. uh
with the alarm in Thailand open my notse
and read my long-term goals which said I
will not quit this game until I make $1
million and at that time I did not get
the Joy from poker I I was just pretty
much forcing myself but still I had you
know something to prove to myself so I
kept going and I remember 31st December
I played of 2017 I played probably last
the last session at that time and the
next next morning early morning we meet
with lucky CPS and Stefan for a
breakfast and we talk we discuss some
hands I remember this game like super
brightly because because then I come
back home I start calculating my results
and my bank roll because the year has
passed and I see that I've reached my
goal I have like more than $1 million
dollars and at that point I close like
at all the clients I delete everything
and I just quit like the same moment I I
don't I don't talk about poker anymore
and it lasts for like three months so
for the next three months I would do
nothing about pocker I never thought
about it I never wanted to come back
just nothing I would just read a lot of
different books do Sports walk spend
time with friends but just forget about
pocker never wanting to come back but
then interesting yeah but then I
realized like dude you know what it's
like 2018 and $1 million in 2018 it's
not something that would kind of make
you financially independent but on on a
more serious note uh you know three
months of a lifestyle like that when you
don't think about money you have some
Financial pillow whatever um other
things come to your realization that uh
per human it is normal to do to work
it's normal to do something and you have
to re you have some potential you have
to realize it otherwise you're not going
to feel happy and I realized that my
potential was not realized in pocker and
there is a long way to go yes I won the
X amount of money but did I really do my
best did I really build the best version
of myself well hell no I was just a
pretty good player uh who made the ex
amount of money so then I realized that
well I'm not done with the pocker I have
to come back but I have to do it on the
on the next level I have to change the
way I was doing things so I remember
talking to like a CPS Stefan and then
there the third guy um he's less known
in the English speaking world but he's a
great theoretician and a very smart
player his name on stars is uh
morphology I think uh on Russian
speaking forums his name is booty in her
face so shout to booty yeah and I've
asked them if I could work with them
together again and that I was ready to
work eight hours every day that uh I
want to hire a mimon coach to try some
new approaches how to memorize stuff
just try everything and try to apply
some knowledge that I've gotten from the
other books that I've read and like
super being super motivated wanting to
get the reach the very top to become
like top 10 in the world let's
go love it and yeah very interesting how
um you almost say complete one goal like
climbing the mountain and when you got
there it was almost like an end of
chapter complete closure and it left you
in this kind of period of for three
months where you you didn't really know
what you wanted to do or what what your
next Target was and then from there from
that space the next next Mountain
appeared which was back to poker but
with a different goal different purpose
to become a better version of yourself
on that Journey um yeah it's really
interesting how we can from the outside
look like we're on the same path doing
the same goal but it completely changes
what you're trying to achieve from that
kind of Journey and yeah sounds like for
you like the first Mountain was climbed
now the second one was presenting itself
very curious to know that in our kind of
um research for this podcast there was a
article about you and it mentions your
high points and things you're most proud
of and one of them was self-reflection
and the ability to work efficiently on
your mistakes you mentioned this as a
kind of a superpower for yourself I'm
curious to know what that process looks
like for you how do you self-reflect and
how do you efficiently learn from your
mistakes throughout your
career um okay so the principle is super
easy it's taken from the cognitive
behavioral
psychology uh whenever something happens
in your life that makes you feel bad or
not satisfied and it was not your fault
did not depend on you and it means that
probably your perception of reality is
wrong that something is wrong with it if
things that do not depend on you make
you feel upset like this is not correct
this is not how the world should work so
then you try to analyze it you write
down first thing is the stimuli like
what was the
event well the only one thing I can
recall right now to give you a bright
example was when I returned to Kiev um
after like 10 year what seven years of
not leaving spending any time in Ukraine
uh renting an apartment and I remember I
would go for a breakfast in a small
local cafe and I see uh two two
beautiful girls sitting on the next
table and I was like hey I have to like
approach them I have to ask their name
one of them maybe maybe two would be too
much for for this time so here I would I
have to get your number I have to come
up and approach her and then all this
like um obstacles in my head arise like
hey you just moved to this place what if
they say no and waiters see that uh what
will they think about you how
embarrassing would it be like are you
sure you want to do that like who even
does that in the 21st century dude there
is the what what Tinder whatever so I
obviously do not approach them I miss
that and then I go on my back home and I
feel so like angry at myself like so
ashamed realizing like what the hell
this thinking is so wrong I had to do
that but to um connect this thing on
both the logical and the emotional
levels I had to run this analysis like a
hand history life hand history when you
write on a paper like event I did not
approach to girls then why do I think
that this is not right why do I think
that my perception of reality at that
point was skewed or twisted and then I
write
because well first of all there is
nothing wrong of approaching to young
girls saying hello what blah blah blah
Etc asking them for their number second
even if you get rejected it's fine I
mean everyone gets rejected it's the
part of the game it's it's totally fine
you cannot win in this game the any
other way you just have to get through
it come on this is these other rules do
it and then like number three what
should I do to actually fix it so pretty
simple but the thing is it doesn't work
work that way like you write it down and
aha it's fixed you have to actually go
through it many times and then just
repeat and analyze and then try to
change at least you know a centimeter
move a centimeter forward uh to be a
little bit better um you know
thinker and actor in that case than you
were
before yes I love that and you need to
first of all as you mentioned map out
the whole Trigger or stimulus response
how you AC in and how you would like to
act in future but then at some point you
need to put it together with actual
repetition and you need to go up to
another set of girls and go right next
to the girls next time I go up I'm going
ask for the number and then you try
again and maybe you fail again you
didn't didn't ask for the number again
and then again you go okay what did I
learned from the second ago okay fail
two times again I didn't go I didn't
speak to them and yeah I think in poker
as well anything in life you've got to
uh you've got to have repetitions of
trying to override your response to the
trigger so the way I look at it there's
a trigger a response relationship and
often the meaning you given events is
what holds it together you need to
identify the ones which aren't in
alignment with where you want to be in
Life or how you want to behave spot them
get really clear on it and then you've
got to come up with the new kind of
behavior you want to do in future but
then you need to run drills run drills
train and train and train and practice
till that becomes the new default
Behavior so for you and the girl
scenario you need to go to 20 sets of
girls and speak to every single one of
them until that becomes yes that's the
default got it down ah and it comes from
conceptual I think that's where a lot of
people struggle where they can often
either over complicate the process of
mapping it out or not want to map it out
and then not realize okay it's not fixed
until you've actually got some real life
experience in the trenches of actually
coming to terms with the emotions
because in the process of writing things
out it's all logical and it's all just
yes this is what to do this is what I
should do but in the moment now we got
emotions now we got insecurity now
you've got a little bit of sweat in the
body you're like oh maybe today is not a
good day and you You' got to learn to
overcome all of those so I think
understanding that process and I think
as you've mentioned as well like these
skills are super important for all of
life like identifying the things that
cause you to act in ways you aren't
happy with keep this kind of mental hand
history coming up with a solution to
change that and then yeah running
repetitions to uh to get better at it so
yeah I think it's a a good life lesson
even though we're talking about picking
up girls I think an approach is applies
to uh changing your Pock strategy and
dealing with emotions and tilt at the
tables as well uh so yeah I want to
segue now a little bit into uh R
battling and I know for yourself you had
a lot of experience reg batt especially
your 10ks and as you working up reg
Warren I think you call it so for you I
want to know the mindset that is
different for playing regulars and reg
Waring compared to just a normal grind
and I want to go into this because I
think we've talked about kind of moving
up Stakes a lot with different guests
but we haven't really dived into the
difference of the mindset needed to
battle the best players at a certain
level and be competitive with them to
either beat them or to get a win rate
and I think for you I think you've had
experience of going into this kind of
world so yeah I want to know like for
you what was the main chapters of your
career where you were doing a lot of R
war in and what was the mindset you
needed to actually come out on top of
those reg
Wars well I think the most important
thing that people might uh Overlook or
not pay enough attention when it comes
to rag Wars is that you have to really
really really try to get into your
opponent's head so you have to like uh
get the hand history andal it and then
you have to play a small number of
tables because if you play too many
tables you cannot notice the timing
tells which can be very essential and
you need to make notes you know to
confirm them in the future like is this
timing tell true or was it just you know
because the guy went to drink some water
so if you catch him doing the same thing
again you can write it down and then
exploit it and you need to be you know
fully present it's very hard to play a r
War if you play um you know few
different opponents at the same time few
different tables so before starting the
session at some point I was like forcing
myself I was not allowing myself to play
a rag war if I had more than x tables
running and then I would just have to
close something I would I I did not
allow myself to play more than I think
two or three tables of rag Wars at the
same time so I tried to be very very
present and to analyze to not join games
where I did not have the information
about my willing so if I only had some
basic idea about his play I would
probably not play but it depends you
know if I think that his overall
strategy is weaker then I would
definitely play but if I think that he's
playing better than me then I would
avoid those games so it's like like rag
war bump hunting if we can call it like
that I don't think it's correct because
you still get to play lots of games
where there is no big Edge like I did
not have big Edge in those games in some
of the lineups I had well the maximum
maybe two maybe three BB Edge sometimes
zero sometimes negative like minus one
BB or minus two but it still would pay
off if there is a fish in a Lobby plus
the idea of the rag war is to get the
tables like if you play against people
and they realize that they are losing to
you and they don't want to continue they
just leave and then you get to sit at
the table so this is one of the
objectives as well so you get to play
with fish more often without having to
be concentrated all the time in the
lobia are there any R Wars that come to
mind where an opponent was getting the
better of you and you were struggling to
deal with that because I know of myself
having done some R battling myself I
know how much it hurts when you're
losing to the same opponent day after
day and you're fighting this real kind
of visceral Battle of trying to out
strategy him and if you're losing that
battle it's one of the kind of the worst
experiences in my opinion as a poker
player of yourself any battles that come
to mind where you were losing to an
opponent and what did you learn for that
process and what did you you go through
yeah the one that comes to my mind is
playing against uh well it was not the r
war in six Max it was fighting for
tables playing heads up against antoa
1998 uh in six Max Games I would study I
study his game I would understand him
really well and I had a lot of like
notes and ideas how to play against him
but then starting to play at heads up up
you know going into the field I would
just get beaten and realize like okay in
heads up you can keep it because I I
could not outplay him uh I would just
keep losing to him even though I thought
that I had an edge the practice showed
that I did not or another example there
was a bot on ACR his name was 2 BTC on
red and maybe you guys heard about that
guy or bloody wolf on Chico I think
before like some famous Russian bot who
got banned maybe not long time ago so I
would analyze his game and then try to
give him a fight try to exploit his
leaks and once again I had a list of the
leaks I thought I would exploit but then
I just start playing against him and get
beaten and like okay you can take
it what were some of the lessons you
learned for reg Warren that you wouldn't
have learned if you just bump
hunted um I think one of the cool
lessons which is not super obvious is is
that it forces you to to play the best
game you can like it actually forces you
to play you know when two tables being
100% present thinking about range just
visualizing them on every street it
makes you think on a deeper level than
you usually do when you play tables with
fish when you just play your ABC or
maybe a bit more complex than that
strategy but then your your objective is
the fish obviously you don't really try
hard but against regulars you have to
find the edge in a very in every spot
possible so you have to force yourself
and you get tired really fast like it's
it's impossible to play well at least
for me to rag war for many hours I would
just get you know burned
out yeah it's that level of intensity
which is just different everything's
just dialed up there's just smaller
edges everywhere and yeah you're trying
to exploit them they're trying to
exploit you at the same time there's a
lot of intentionality with your strategy
and trying to uh keep on top of
everything as they're trying to keep on
top of everything with you as well so
yeah I can relate to that as well how
draining and tiring it is uh when you're
playing yeah especially aggressive
opponent who's putting you in tough
spots and making the game tree quite
complicated for

and maybe you will get a chance to work
work with me and Adam and make more
progress in your poke career but for now
without further Ado let's get back into
more goodness in today's episode so for
you what would you say um was the high
point of your PO career to this date so
we've got this reg War I think this was
nl10 K where you did a lot of battling
what would you say was the highest point
as you've climbed up from nl10 all the
way to that the highest stes what was
the the best point for
you um uh okay I don't know if can call
it the best point for me because I try
to rate everything in my life from the
perspective of Happiness like how happy
does it make me feel whatever I do at
this moment so if we talk about poker
success then the best moments were for
sure the last year of my poker
career I remember this summer of 2020
when I when I thought that okay playing
pocker is Fun making money is fun high
stakes good and that but I want like
more I want to actually become top three
in the world I did not not say top one
because there was Stefan and lonus and I
was like ah [ __ ] them I'm not going to
outplay Stefan well I know Stefan for
many years I think he's one of the most
talented uh players and a very
hardworking players as well so I kind of
did not have those ideas that I could
you know win him if he actually tries to
um to out compete me in this like long
distance rag war or the lonus I I didn't
actually get to play a lot with lonus
because we played in the completely
different time zone but I analyze I
studied his game a lot and yeah he's
he's a one well one of the greatest
players ever obviously so my objective
would be okay can I get to top three and
if I can what do I need to do for that
so I made the plan I've got a list of
spots that I want to study and I decided
that I give myself 100 days to study
Theory only from 6 to 8 hours every day
with a day off of course and then I
would play only one one session in a
week just to to keep to stay sharp and
all the other time I would just do the
theory and I was like very motivated by
this desire to prove to myself first of
all if I can be the best if I can be in
a top 10 and uh I've learned a lot about
the game at that point I actually went
through that challenge I don't remember
how many hours of theory took maybe four
from 4 to 600 hours I don't remember for
sure but I had a plan I've completed it
like 90% I felt extremely strong at that
time like R waren playing playing the
short stack like seeing many spots where
I had the edge I studied the short stch
play for many many hours and I realized
that many people play it but they don't
really understand it so I was you know
very very motivated but then I've kind
of reached the point of the uh um Health
breakdown when like many things happen
at once
um like my my sleep had totally uh bro
was totally broken and an interesting
fact to mention it's not uh fixed even
even by now I still have some problems
with sleep so um because I was over
pressing myself and working extremely
hard and uh then my health just started
to fall apart in some areas and I was
getting very unhappy by that lifestyle I
realized that like why the hell am am I
even doing that so at some point I had a
session with psychologist and then he
asked me like have you consider to just
quit this game and and just to give you
uh just to give you the perception of
what go was going on we were talking
about how to deal with tilt and he has
given me this advice like go to a cheap
Chinese shop and buy some you know um
glasses uh and then just break them and
scream in the house try that I was like
ah sounds like a great idea let's do it
so I've tried many things and what I've
ended up with you know being not very
happy and having a very bad sleep some
lower back pro pro uh problems and I
realized that if you have some health
issues you can it's well it's very hard
to feel happy it's very hard to feel
happy when you feel the pain all the
time so I've thought that maybe I should
just step down and the hell with it I'll
just concentrate on coaching and see
where it will lead
me interesting so I'm curious to know
with this quite extreme approach of the
68 hours of theory and then the one one
day of playing how did that work in
practice H just I'm just asking that
question as I see a lot of players who
potentially study a lot but don't play
much they end up creating this massive
gap between their knowledge and theory
and understanding and the game they can
actually execute in game it's almost
like they um they lack this performance
sharpness because they've got so much
ideas they've learned but they actually
haven't played enough volume to kind of
solidify those new ideas so I'm curious
to know with you when you you've got
this kind of really high amount of study
hours in only one day of playing how was
that working in practice in terms of
your ability to execute the strategy
that you were
learning well I think um I had a huge
background of the practice if we can
call it a huge hour a very sorry many
hours of practice uh I've requested my
hands on Poker Stars just recently and
the lifetime volume was like 2.5 or 2.4
million of hands and it was just one of
the eight rooms that I played and I
never multi- tabled a lot you know
usually six tables or less maybe more on
the earlier stages but definitely not
the last few years so I've had a lot of
practice and I think the uh the problem
with theoreticians is that they don't
really have those hours they kind of uh
play sometimes but study a lot and they
then don't get to test those things in
real real life and theory is very
different you know when you work in
solar and then when you play against
people yes com Concepts work the same
way but if you don't understand how
people deviate then you end up with
copying the solar you're not playing GTO
you're just playing your vision of GTO
your perception of GTO which is very far
from the real GTO because I mean no
matter how many hours you study you
cannot reach the prowess of playing like
a solver so you kind of play that
copycat strategy that is targeted to
reach the equilibrium against the solver
that knows your strategy and when you do
that against people you end up slightly
losing or playing no breaking even if
you do some exploits at least so it
doesn't really work it's very easy to
just open the hand history put on the
smart face and say okay solare Does this
solare does de that's why we do this but
without the practice it's just not a
winning
strategy so what were you doing
differently to avoid that trap what were
you doing with your approach to stud in
that stopped you trying to replicate the
solver and spending too much time in
theory how did you create that
practicality with your approach well
I've spent immense number of hours
thinking about how should a perfect
study algorithm well not perfect but the
best study algorithm look like uh what
works and what doesn't because I had
some friends who played lower stakes and
who would work like 12 hours in P solver
every day for a long time but then just
not being able to move higher than an
L200 and I've spent a lot of time asking
questions like what should I do should I
do this or not and I've tried different
approaches different ways to study
Theory um to analyze spots how to
remember spots the in the best way
sometimes I would you know spend 10
hours trying to end analyze one board
and then I would really not learn
anything new but then I would spend the
two hours doing things differently and I
would learn much more so I've just uh I
started to craft my Approach try and
learning from errors and then trying it
with my students as well because I I've
been coaching uh as a part-time job if
we call it like that since uh 2015
making some
breaks and uh having groups for the
long-term coaching since 2018 I think
and then I would try and see if my
students can work can learn the same way
I do and I've learned that people are
different and my Approach that is
perfect for me it may not be perfect for
some of my students they have to tweak
it they have to change it a little bit
so it took a lot of time to try and
repeat I'll leave it to Renee to go
deeper into picking your brain on your
unique approach to study in but I just
want to ask you one thing around
motivation and rising up the stakes
because again researching for this
podcast you mentioned one of the most
critical factors in moving up Stakes was
motivation and the desire to achieve my
goals at all costs so for you talk us
through uh how this functioned for you
because I think you've mentioned
previously how it's kind of driven you
to want to get better to make money to
beat other people but talk how this
insatable desire motivation was so
critical for you to have the success
you've
had um you know as a psychologist as
someone with a background in Psychology
you you definitely know that that
different things might away different
people and for someone the fear of that
could be like the best motivator for
other person it might not do as much job
for someone this is could be the anger
for the other person could be money but
money I think it can cannot motivate
anyone on a very long run if we think
about it on a short run sure but on Long
Run I think it's not even possible that
uh I I don't I don't think we can find
any great athletes who are motivated by
money only I don't think it's possible
from what I've read and from my
experience at least I may be wrong
though so
um I remember this notion that like the
idea that I've
gotten that if you if you got no way to
retreat if there is no way to retreat
you know like during the ancient Wars
when Greek generals would burn their
ships so there is no way to retreat you
have to die or to Prevail so I would
pretty much try to put myself on a
similar mindset and I would say like
[ __ ] it I will achieve it or I will die
I mean like there's no way out I'll just
do it do it do it do it do it there's
just no other option so being very harsh
on myself but it what was working for me
I'm not saying that it it is the optimal
strategy or that it would work for other
people for some for sure but for others
not yeah I think you touched on
something very important there of
understanding what motivates and drives
you to get to where you want to get to
in life overall and you mentioned that
kind of do a die mentality the no plan B
I'm going to make this work at all costs
and for you during that particular
chapter of your career that worked
perfectly because it allowed you to tap
into energy reserves to uh to make it
work for other people like they may
break down or become overwhelmed but
they'll have I think almost everyone has
some motivational Drive they can tap
into whether it's to have success for
themsel success for their family whether
it's to achieve whatever outcomes
whether it's to become the best version
of themsel and reach their full
potential there's some level you can tap
into a motivational driver that allows
you uh to really push yourself and
really get the most out of yourself so
yeah really I'm glad you Shar with us
your du die mentality and Achieve Su
success all cost I'm sure a lot of
listeners will also resonate with that
as their Drive other people will be like
that's not me I need to think about what
actually motivates me to want to have
the the success that I I want to have in
life now we almost touched on your
approaches to studying which I know Rene
would be very curious to get deeper into
so I'm going to pass over to Renee to uh
ask questions about your approach to W
on your technical game as you progress
your career so over to you Renee
actually I have one question for you
Adam in the meanwhile I just wrote it
down because you mentioned like you know
people have different drives I I I was
listening here on the sideline I was
also reflecting like my drive and what
drives me and I feel like it also
changes a lot and to be honest for
myself I'm still sort of questioning it
like what actually does really drive me
so question for you Adam how does one
find out what drives
them I think it first of all starts
about understanding who you want to be
identity wise so the version of yourself
you want to be so at certain times of
your life you might want to be the high
s pocket player you might want to be the
family man you might want to be the the
free spirit who uh lives the life of
abundance so you've got to understand
like some sort of aspirational identity
you want to be and I also think you need
to understand your values what are the
core values you have I think everyone if
you spend some time with it you could
narrow down your personality down to
three to five values so it could be
growth achievement relationships health
and really understand the cocktail of
kind of values that are in alignment
with you and then you've got to
understand what makes you tick the why
behind what you do and this way you've
got to do some exploring so yeah I think
if you can just spend some time on the
identity that you want to into normally
in alignment with the goals you're
trying to achieve at that time it's
almost like the character you need to be
to win the game that you're currently
playing if you think of life as
upgrading your character to achieve
certain goals and win games that you're
currently playing and then the values
and the values are always about the
things that make you happy the things
that intrinsically drive you motivate
you and you'll realize when you're out
of alignment when you feel unfulfilled
on the path so for example if you're
grinding every day like sergy was and
you start to feel unfulfilled on that
process you're likely neglecting some of
your values whether it's Health whether
it's relationships whether it's growth
in terms of learning other things so
your why is going to change I think over
time but the main thing is this kind of
understanding your values alignment with
that and striving towards new identity I
think if you get those things somewhat
in alignment and you're reflecting on
how you're feeling on the process
towards your goals and and outcomes I
think that creates over time the purpose
and the the kind of why what you're
moving towards this is then also kind of
where Role Models come in so let's say
you have guys that you look up to will
they be in line with the Identity or the
future identity that you have for
yourself usually you relate to people
who have an aspirational identity that
you would like to at least tap into
certain parts of their character traits
so you're like oh I admire his
confidence I admire his work ethic his
ambition there's something about them so
With Your Role Models it's actually very
good to write the exact character trait
you like because every human's a
multifaceted uh person they've got good
points bad points and you might go I
really like how driven he is I really
like his work ethic but I don't really
like how he is with his family he seems
like he's a single guy doesn't really
put any attention to family life so I
want to have those character traits but
I don't like that one and yeah I think
you often almost always gravitate
towards people you can learn from you're
entertained by or they have aspirational
uh identity traits that you can you can
learn from or aspire to I remember in
the conversation uh with sergy we talked
a lot about your why how much F sergy
have you put into
the identity I remember you were reading
for example for Haley's blog maybe that
served as some of a role model within
the profession but you also mentioned
that every day you just looked at okay I
want to make a million and then when you
made a million you quit you quit poker
so I guess that was a goal but it wasn't
really in line with your values kind of
that Adam already touched on how much F
did you put in like the identity that
you have for yourself and what are your
current values and how have you how do
you nowadays try to build your life
around that and how how might that not
have been in line in the
past okay so that was a great question
and a great answer by Adam by the way
and I've read quite a few books on the
topic on of your purpose and your
identity and I think he has summarized
it greatly and uh regarding the role
models I'd say that uh well it one of
the key things in my life uh to have a
role model for each um part of my life
for example um some people who are great
pocker players would be a role model how
to play and approach this game some
people who are kind with other people
and respectful and have no anger would
be a role model for me to change my
personality to be more like them to be a
better person and then some people who
would let's say being super Achievers in
sport who treat who teach themselves to
enjoy the discomfort and Prevail no
matter what they would motivate me to do
better in sports and partially in pocker
so yeah my my answer would be that I
always try to find a role model and I
have many of them well maybe not many
but at least a few for different areas
of life how do you then switch between
the two so for example if I recall when
I was solely focus on poker and trying
to become the best yes it would that
that character right that would really
help me in poker but then outside of
Poker I would experience more difficulty
so how did you go about switching
between certain characters in different
environments for example maybe in a
certain environment you want to be more
loving caring and empathetic but when I
walk into my office I just want to be a
killer well that's another great
question so guys another heads off and
thanks for invit me for this podcast I
really enjoy it so far so that's the
thing I've realized at the end of my
career that it is not possible for me to
uh achieve my goals in poer to be one of
the best in in the world and to be
aligned with the other values because
these things they just do not work
together at least in my case because if
you want to be the best in pocker like
top three let's say you have to
sacrifice your partially your
relationship partially your family time
time with your friends your
self-development you cannot really
progress in other areas you cannot read
a lot and one of my deep values is let's
say attraction to we wisdom if we can
call it like that so reading books
understanding the way this world the way
this reality works so I realized that it
would not be possible to be the great
pocker player and do all that at the
same time so some role models are in are
indeed incompatible and you can just try
to get a piece of that behavior approach
mindset but then you have to understand
that if you get the whole picture it
would probably not um work if you have
some other goals that are not aligned
with this one I remember I've done a lot
of work with uh you mentioned Jared
actually lot I've done many many hours
with Jared shout out to Jared tendler
also done many many hours with other
psychologists have switched psychologist
multiple times I feel like a
psychologist can teach you maybe a
certain way a certain perspective but
then at some point I feel like the
sessions become a bit Yeah a bit boring
and then I switch and then I get New
Perspectives I remember if you explained
to psychologists who are not into poker
and you explain about poker they're like
are you sure you want to be the one of
the best poker players in the world
doesn't really seem like you know that
that's really great for your life
outside of you sitting behind your PC so
a lot of the characteristic traits that
I would then explain like oh but I want
to be like this I want to be like this
so I can perform better at the poker
tables they would usually say I don't
think this is a great idea in terms of
how you want to live your life as as
like a hole if you zoom out of Poker and
I remember actually one of my reasons
why I decided to steer into a different
direction than to continue uh playing
playing solely high stakes poker was
actually also because of growth I felt
like I was it was growth but very
onedimensional and I figured I would
have to start doing other things to grow
in different directions I wasn't really
sure how and how that would look but I
figured okay I'm just going to put
myself in different positions and then I
guess growth in different directions
will followed now this strategy has
worked but also has obviously some
downside so I wouldn't necessarily
recommend it uh but yeah I can
definitely relate you talked a lot about
your your journey you talked a lot about
personal development you read a lot of
books I was curious of the habits that
you've developed and certain R routines
that You' have established which have
been the biggest game changers for you
in terms of increasing your
performance oh I I have a fun answer for
uh for this question so um accidentally
let's say accidentally uh this idea
appeared in my mind that I should to
track the level of my happiness every
day so by the end of the day I would
just write down a number from0 to 10 uh
how happy did I was this day lived and
then I would maybe leave some comments
uh like what made me angry or what made
me happy and Etc so every single day
I've been doing it since like
2018 and this idea actually appeared
from poker because I would analyze every
session of mine uh when I've started
playing high stakes actively I would
give myself grades in in my psychology
performance in my technical performance
and some other um things so it struck me
that why am I not doing the same thing
about the happiness if happiness is uh
the main thing in my life one of the
main things like there is no objective
point in this life to me but there is a
subjective point that we um create for
ourselves and to me the one of these
things is happiness so I've started
tracking it down and I remember uh
meeting with for Hal I've known him for
like 10 years by now and um I haven't
seen him in person for a couple of years
and then we met in 2021 and I remember
just sitting in Cafe and then I asked
him like Hey I've been doing this thing
for two years what do you think about it
tracking your level of happiness and he
looks at me and like I've been doing
that for three years I'm like what the
hell I read so many books about
happiness I never seen it anywhere like
how how did you get to this idea so we
we laughed off it and like having some
Reflections about this habit I think it
was one of the most important um
contributors to my increased level of
Happiness if we can call it so so what
were your findings out of your uh out of
your research well the funniest one was
that the last year of my poker career
which was one of the success one of the
most most successful financially and uh
definitely one the S the most successful
technical wise was one of mine happiest
years like the level of my happiness was
something like
5.9 in a year on a scale from 1 to 10
which was like not really fun and after
seeing that I've thought like okay if
I'm living this life I can die any
moment I mean life is
unpredictable um is this the real life I
want to live like being happy 5.9 out of
10 playing pocker high stakes being one
of the best trying to be one of the best
like is it even worth it and yeah that
was one of the moments when I realized
that obviously not and that I would
probably not uh return to my player
career anymore because um it just does
not me make me happy
unfortunately what have you found to be
the biggest contributors to scoring
closer to a 10 out of 10 on a daily
basis uh um well 10 out of 10 is not
possible on a daily life basis I
remember walking with my friend and I
asked him like on a scale from one to 10
how happy do you think you are and he's
like and I ask him how happy do you feel
right now and he's like 10 and then I
ask him dude like when you have an
orgasm how do you feel like that is the
10 out of 10 or when you I don't know
try drugs but let's not discuss drugs
drugs are bad not I felt a 10ad of when
I was using drugs so my solution is I
use drugs every
day yeah but the idea was that people
who don't really track it they might
really underestimate the level of their
happiness like 10 is the most happy you
ever you know feel you maybe have a 10
10 or maybe less moments like that in a
year or maybe I don't know in a lifetime
like when your baby is born my baby was
not born yet so I don't know but people
say they feel absolutely happy
absolutely fantastic or when you fall in
love and you know this is when you feel
10 out of 10 so in real life I don't
think it's even achievable to leave
higher than like
7.5 that it's really hard to leave a
couple of month months in a row and be
happy more than 7.5 because you know our
nervous system is just going to get
overwhelmed and when we feel very happy
few days in a row we just feel burned
out so it's also an art of balance you
have to balance your you like when you
get some um exciting moments in your
life let's say you do the bunge jump you
may feel lots of adrenaline and maybe
happiness if it makes you happy but try
doing some other extreme sport the next
day and then other extreme sport the
next day you will burn out really
quickly so the idea is that you have to
balance your experience as well I guess
we need more metrics here because if we
talk about happiness it almost seems
like now we're talking about a rushia of
dopamine or adrenaline whereas I guess
for example actually I talked to a
friend of mine recently and he was
talking about the difference between him
him and his girlfriend he said my
girlfriend or wife chases happiness
whereas I chase peace of mind so I guess
there's a couple of like a certain level
of Serenity Peace of Mind happiness
certain level of just overall
satisfaction uh may maybe not
satisfaction is like you're just uh
content with your situation because I
feel like you don't want to be just
chasing moments of happiness in your
life right that's also what you're
saying you cannot try to chase moments
of Happiness 10 out of 10 I think heard
danzarin actually talk about this that
you can also you can just destroy
yourself completely he says I can no
longer get satisfaction out of driving a
nice car or eating in a nice restaurant
because I have the best chefs in the
world every day cook for me so food is
no longer able to satisfy me I eat a 10
out of 10 every day doesn't anymore feel
like a 10 out of 10 can only go
backwards same with cars probably it's
the same for him with women he has too
many women so at some point it's like
listen it can only go downhill from
there so I think he talked about about
the concept of being very careful with
like what type of enjoyments you you you
try to experience because it could set a
new Baseline for your happiness and once
you've once you've done that for example
people that say I flew business class
once and now every day when I'm an
economy I feel miserable because I've
had the experience of business class if
you ever thought about this concept I'm
I'm sure you have yeah sure that's
pretty much the honic threadmill idea
like the more enjoyment you get the
higher the level of your excitement is
the more you need in the future to feel
the same dope rush or the rush of
dopamine do do you do you actively try
to calibrate like your moments of let's
say high
dopamine um so when you're in the bar
again you see another two hot Ukrainian
women you're like oh I already had two H
gr women yesterday let's back off today
you know not really I would not say that
I calibrate it manually because the life
I live right now like from your example
with your friend and his girlfriend I
think they actually talked about the
same concept but she was like in her
words chasing the happiness maybe was
meant to be chasing the excitement and
uh I mean his definition of happiness is
uh something I'm aligned with like I
would agree that this is the state of
Peace of your mind when you feel content
when everything is nice when everything
is great actually I think the one of the
greatest words to describe happiness is
love when you feel love when you love
let's say your girlfriend wife whatever
parents child that is when you feel
happy that is when you feel 10 out of 10
on of your love I would say also like
love love yourself and love your love
your day-to-day routine like if you can
just enjoy the little things like oh I
go for a nice morning walk with my dog
sit down have a nice little coffee enjoy
the sunshine on my skin you know it can
be something as easy as that where I
think it's a definitely a trap to just
keep on chasing like
that like like yeah like like you said
about the treadmill like the the the
dopamine chasing I think that's not
really the the the way forward because
like you said you cannot live a 10 out
of 10 and if that's your expectation
then yeah you probably feel quite
unsatisfied exactly the the art of
happiness is to live everyday life
happily when you don't have any super
events that make your brain explode that
they don't happen to you just enjoy
these simple things and you actually
feel it and one of the life hacks how to
actually do that is to you know have
some kind of gratitude diary when you um
you asked me about the routine before so
this is one of the answers by the way
when you wake up in the morning um the
first thing I try to do is to think
about one person who I am grateful for
in my life and what I am exactly
grateful for and then three things I am
grateful for as well one could be the
one that I feel in the moment for
example I'm super grateful because I
have this bottle I can drink water it
feels so great and I try to feel it and
then I think about okay I have my health
I have my wife I I have my parents I'm
super happy and it makes your day much
better it makes you actually feel very
happy and content if you stop noticing
those things if you get on a honic
treadmill you just get used to it and
you feel
unsatisfied there's a great quote which
says you what you focus on is what you
feel so basically if you focus on the
things that you're grateful for you will
feel quite grateful whereas if you focus
on [ __ ] what's missing in my life every
day and you try to run run run behind it
and then when you have it you think
about the next thing yeah then it's
basically a lifelong of of chasing
without satisfaction uh many of the
things that you talked about I've
experimented with as well and to some
degree have implemented but then I
usually struggled with oh I do it for
like a month or two months and what I
especially noticed was I was chasing a
lot of personal development for the sake
of being a high performer in poker and
what I struggled with myself and I'm
curious if you've experienced this or if
not how you fixed it when I stopped uh
playing high stakes poker when there was
the necessity to actually show up as the
best version of myself I noticed that I
lacked a lot of discipline or a lot of
the habits that I had that kind of fell
away because I would like what's the
point I don't have to play today anyway
did you experience something like that
and if so if not what would be your
advice to
me um I think everybody experiences such
moments in in his career like everyone
and uh
um I think it's important to find the re
to find your reasons why as the Adam
said like to find new reasons why for
example uh when I wasn't very motivated
by poker I remember that active coaching
is what makes made me love this game
more like when my love let's say was
fading to Poker and it wasn't as fun I
realized that looking at this game
Through The Eyes of your students plus
answering their questions it make you
think about the game from the different
angle it makes you study more yourself
and um you get this feel that you're not
playing a zero sum game actually because
what I don't like about poker the most
is that it is a zero sum game like
defeat or get defeated I love to compare
poker with MMA or Gladiator fights every
day you get into this Arena and you
fight and you're beaten or you beat
someone that's not the best mindset if
you want to live a happy life you know
and when you coach you pretty much uh
that's a win-win situation or when you
work with your teammates before coaching
what I was getting a lot of satisfaction
for maybe even more than from the game
itself is with working uh is from
working with my friends my poker friends
friends I would spend like a lot of many
hours with them not talking just about
poker but about other things and this
team play element it also added a lot of
satisfaction a lot of Joy from the
game I think
necessity is also a very important point
there I remember actually a student of M
pointed out was quite a big realization
for me he said well it sounds quite easy
I remember I remember I was giving we
were giving live classes at the time so
there was an actual CL classroom like
eight eight guys everyone was Dutch and
they were we were talking a bit about
these topics about discipline and then I
mentioned like the same thing that I
just mentioned that I felt like I was
slacking and then M said well it's quite
simple right you find you found or find
being able to perform in poker more
important than to be able to perform in
life I was like oh that's that's that
that that that's a pretty big uh that's
a pretty big statement I reflect on was
like actually that that's probably true
I felt like the poker performance
performance or having to perform was
more driven by a more negative type of
emotion like I had a certain anxiety or
something that I wanted to get rid of
through self-development and then in
life I didn't experience that anxiety so
there was less of a necessity right it's
easy I was just content with my life and
I wasn't necessarily striving for my
life to be the I wasn't I wasn't
striving for my life to be number one
just like I was striving in poker to
become number one so the necessity was
naturally lower I would be like in the
morning like why would I jump into a
cold shower if I'm not having to perform
at my absolute best in an hour from now
let's skip the cold shower you know like
obviously there are certain things like
I would continue to work out I would
continue to eat healthy because they
they were more like deeper actual values
but the other things were more like
performance hacks in order to make sure
that that would perform which I think in
hset was more driven by like removing
certain negative emotions like anxiety
or fear of loss uh stuff among among
those lines you also mentioned that what
you really liked about personal
development is that you were able to
take certain Concepts and apply them
into your life now I think you mentioned
as well you read like sports psychology
books uh try to understand like mindsets
of certain athletes and try to apply
them to Poker how has that switch been
for you and how do you now try to apply
self-development into your life compared
to when you were doing it in poker I
guess the type of books that you're
reading now also change maybe it was
more around being the best performer and
nowadays like you said more about
happiness yeah in the names of active
pocker those were the books about the
best performance as you rightly noted I
think one of the let's say Paragon books
it's called tools of the tools of Titans
by team Ferris uh I think it's it's
quite simple and you know pocker players
could learn many different ideas from
there it's just a book made of many
short interviews with different top
performance we just share their routines
their you know life approach Etc so you
can learn a lot from the best perform
com I remember getting a lot of cool
ideas from there and uh well right now I
I would say that sure my interest have
changed more maybe I've got more
interested in like politics history more
interested about how does this world
function um if we try to zoom out from
our life and see how like the whole
planet functions how did people leave
many thousand years ago what made their
life better or worse than ours what can
we learn from our ANC tors so Evolution
um history philosophy psychology uh yeah
these areas that I was interested in but
had no time or chance to study as I was
an active
player when uh when looking through your
through your poke career you moved up
from 5 andl to all the way to 40K andl
so you literally played every stake
available when Rising through the ranks
which jump in Stakes did you find the
hardest
NL 100 NL 100 you mentioned that right
nine months of struggle after that there
was no more like struggle point where
you were like oh wow this was a really
tough jump oh no there were so many
struggle moments after that one uh like
the biggest downswing in my career I
think
2014 when I lost maybe 30% of my bank
roll something like that playing an up
to an L 2K or 1K so that was really hard
I couldn't just
so I'll give some history here in
2012 the end of 2012 or 2013 I think it
was 2013 to be precise I went to Goa uh
to spend two months there and guys it's
not the best place to to to go when
you're young in your 20s and playing
poker seriously because it gets you way
over relaxed and uh yeah you have a lot
of uh things that seduce you so after
that RP I remember losing my game and it
took me like a year maybe to get back in
track I just couldn't uh play as good as
I used to and no matter what I tried it
just wouldn't work and I've tried so
many strategies some of them were just
Preposterous just extremely stupid like
there was some idea from Matthew J the
book I'm not sure if it was him or
somebody else that GTO means that on a
flop you have like 30% cabat and then
turn and River have 70% seat because you
have like Bluff to value ratio and I've
tried playing that strategy for a long
time I would just you know analyze
boards in flab Zilla trying to see about
30% I mean how how how just silly it is
but I had to try many things until I've
arrived to what was working for me
throughout throughout your career I
think you reached out to many coaches to
to help you one of them actually that I
wanted to touch on I think you you
mentioned that you work with a memory
coach did I did I hear that correctly
maybe yeah I'm neon okay maybe you could
elaborate on that one and has there been
any other coaches or guys that you
worked with very closely that have had a
big impact on your
career precisely on the poker
career no you can you can interpretate
the question however you want maybe you
can do poker and live maybe who sends
out in poker and who sends out in Live
or psychology or
psychologist okay so regarding mimics
yeah I found the person uh the coach uh
Ukrainian coach he's really great and we
work together I don't remember how many
hours maybe up to 20 hours of uh
individual one-on-one classes and uh
I've learned a lot unfortunately 90% of
of that knowledge is not applicable to
Poker that's like the biggest thumbs
down but the cool thing is that the 10%
that I've gotten it was fairly enough to
boost me up because um basically
pneumonics teaches your brain to
remember the plain information like you
can remember a lot of useless data I
think the last exercise that we've done
by the end of our classes um I had to
remember a 200 digigit number in within
20 minutes and then to just like
replicate it and it sounds very cool but
in reality it's just a useless skill
like yes you can do that it's no it's
not that hard 20 hours of training you
can learn that but the problem is it's
absolutely not practical but the cool
thing is while you are doing that you're
still training your brain you're still
going through the drills your your
memory still improves and uh what I've
learned the skill of the visualization
it was one of the best biggest takeaways
from the pneumonics because you memorize
stuff by like turning numbers into
pictures and those pictures into the
stories and then you kind of tell the
story and then you can put the numbers
back and this way I've tried to approach
pocker trying to see the ranges not like
to think about okay we have six combos
of Aces three combos of Kings because
half of them were three but whatever I
try to actually visualize like the
imagine a picture from flab Zilla when
you see this uh you know range I try to
see ranges like that well blandly
speaking on a wall and uh
it worked to me it helped me to
understand game better to to feel the
ranges better if we can say so I I can
relate with that for example if I would
always say like if I would explain
explain like a c no yeah but you know
and then with make like this square and
would say yeah but on these type of
textures we see bet this part or here
the SE betting range is more like top
bottom that's how kind of and but I
couldn't like I wouldn't really be able
to say oh yeah uh 91 off 50% the time
yeah it's somewhere in the mid region so
probably sometimes there's a little bit
of a little bit of pink there a little
bit of pink there a lot of green here
that's kind of how how I memorized
overall uh SE Bing strategies so I think
I I didn't do active coaching on that
but I guess I'm a natural picture type
of learner I I notice the same for
example when I do a psychologist session
I I picture a lot of things I turn
everything into into pictures I'm a very
visual learner do you do you have you
now started to apply that or that did
that type of learning already resonate
with you I've started to apply it maybe
I was just like you seeing stuff you
know Concepts and ideas in in the form
of pictures but I was definitely not
seeing pocker in the term of pictures uh
if somebody would tell me like wake me
up during the night and say okay draw
your reting range small blind versus the
button but not just the list of combas
like draw it draw this picture and I
tried doing that and I actually drawn
quite a few pictures it's not that easy
as it sounds actually if you want to
draw it like precisely in fli Zilla and
it also kind of trains your brain to uh
work with the information that way
through the
visualization I heard you lot talk a lot
about studying even to a point where you
said you were studying what was it like
five hours a day only playing one one
one day a week you've tried many
different strategies as well trying to
get out of the out of the hunel hunel
Trap um What In your experience
throughout your career and also
throughout your experience coaching what
has been the most effective way for you
to work on your game or to build
strategies or to
study uh well that's the algorithm that
I've arrived to by the end of my career
or even the year after actually to be
more precise because uh um once I've
quit poker as a player I've started
coaching more than I did before because
before I would just get like um three to
five people and then work with them one
and a half for one and a half years so
I've started working more and I've
started improving my algorithm and like
making it better so I think the best uh
thing to which I arrived was one year
after quitting pocker and yeah that's
the idea how you approach to spots that
different spots happen with different
frequencies different boards happen with
different frequencies um some are more
important some are less it's not a about
the frequency only it is also about the
possibility to exploit to build exploits
on some boards it is also about a
complexity factor I call it the the
factor that people make people tend to
make more mistakes in some spots and
less in other spots so you should like
kind of identify those and double down
on your double up or whatever increase
your effort and then um there are also
spots that people intuitively play far
from the solver and those SPS are very
interesting to study as well because
there you can make some assumptions like
okay if most of people deviate that much
then I can exploit that and get a lot of
extra e compared to if I just play the
GTO
strategy so many ideas that you can
derive and then put it into a picture
for our audience like who are
probably arise many questions when when
you just quickly explained like your
study algorithm I wanted to pick out one
thing what is like what are like some
characteristics of spots where I think
you mentioned it's easy for people to
make mistakes for the listeners what is
something that they have to look for and
how they can identify a situation where
it's likely that your opponent or the
population in general uh is likely to
screw up by a
lot um well there are a couple of ways
to find such
spots um what what's better to begin
with so the lines that people are
playing the that people play the best
are the most common lines let's say cat
big blind versus the button or defense
against cat it's hard to make a mistake
when you play the strategy for many
years plus you can look up the solver
and correct yourself but then there are
some spots that you don't get to play a
lot for example small blind versus big
blind three but partt when the big blind
checks flop and then small blind has to
act
or even big blind versus the button
single spot when the big blind checks on
a flop if he checks more than the solver
does then on the turn caller has to
protect his calling range he has to
protect his check he has to split his
sizes and there are many ways to make
potential mistakes so those are some
ideas to start with also it's important
while searching for such spots to ask
yourself okay this spot is very hard
people make a lot of mistakes but how
often does it actually happen because I
remember myself finding some spots that
seem like super cool to exploit I was
feeling like super smart but then I I
started playing and I realized that
these spots happen once in a month and
then I feel dumb like what what did I
just waste 20 hours building my exploits
for if it never
happens yeah so it has to be I mean we
talked about this in the podcast many
times like frequency of spot it has to
be like a balance between the frequency
of the spot and the EV of the exploit
let's say you find a River Race exploit
where you know you make quite a lot of
money and that spot you know occurs
maybe once every session or so it can
maybe be quite interesting uh to explore
that but like you said when it only
happens once a month or when something
happens frequently but the EV gain is
very slightly maybe it's not really
worth your time it's very hard to give
an exact metric right you kind of start
to have a feel like okay this was
actually a waste of time and this was
not a waste of time and based on that
you know you're G to uh re recalibrate
your future studying
um you you mentioned about the
characteristics of the spots right that
lead to players making mistakes so
knowing this knowledge how would that uh
change your strategic approach right you
talked a lot about yeah okay the most
frequent spots and the spots that people
are most used to that's where they make
less mistakes so knowing that how does
that impact the strategy that you would
like to
employ well well first of all we've just
crushed the surface here because it's a
very complex uh idea you know your study
approach how you spend two hours of
theory that you can devote every day to
study in theory compared to the field um
it is full of nuances because if you
like the spots that you choose to study
um they they make a very big difference
in a in the long run because if one
person gets the let's say let's rate the
level of the efficiency of approaching
pocker study let's say one person is 80%
efficient and and another person is 90%
or 95% efficient in the long run that is
immen the difference is immense so your
goal is to find as many nuances as you
can to improve your study method as much
as possible because in the long run
you'll have some incredible Edge uh when
The Compound Effect gets into the
play so within your uh your optimized
study
algorithm what are some of the tools
that you like to use and how do you
think you can use them most
effectively well the main tool is solver
before GTO wizard which is now the king
um it was the simple past club which was
by the way not very popular among
english- speaking audience I think most
of uh people used P solver and simple
pup used to be
much better at least at the beginning
and then P has caught up I think the
option of Nod loocks like no loocking
the strategies it was very convenient
you could do that on a go you didn't
have to recalculate the spot from the
very beginning you can just you know get
to the turn and get your calculation in
one two minutes or faster depends on
your PC so uh simple plus flop for sure
and then flip Zilla even though it's
like an outdated tool before the GTO
wizard Zilla had this well it now still
has this very nice function called hold
deck when you can visualize the equity
versus the equity in a graph uh one
position versus another and then you can
see who has the advantage in what type
of equity hands either Den noted not
Equity hands or strong or medium Etc
which gets you to understand the sizings
better and how often to check Etc so it
was super convenient now you get all
these functions in D G
wizard shout out to GTO wizard sponsor
of for Killinger
guys I'm just kidding I I love it it's
very fast very convenient yeah there
there especially like older school
players uh they have mixed feelings
around uh technology developing so so
quickly um you mentioned Also earlier in
the part about the threats right of
using sers I think you talked about
mimic the solvers what are like the most
common leaks you see when players try to
build strategies around solvers we
already talked about in your St study
algorithm maybe players studying spots
that are not that frequent but a l like
common mistakes that they make when
trying to I think you try talked about
copying the solver why is that so
bad okay I think one of the main
misconceptions that people have about
solver is that they for some reason need
to play like a solver but what they
don't get is that solver his strategy is
based on the most optimal strategy while
playing against the same perfect machine
who knows your cards so if you do
something differently you are going to
be instantly punished so the goal of
your strategy is not to like maximize
your EV against this opponent who has
many leaks but to be um invulnerable
yourself to have no weak spas that can
be attacked so you have to mix many
hands into different lines you have to
use randomizer Etc you have to call down
using the frequencies and so on and so
forth when in practice people just have
so many leaks and if you try to play the
solar strategy I mean I've tried to
shortly explain this idea in my next
video that will be released soon I I
talk about it that
um people don't really ask themselves a
very simple question that would explain
it why is there were no um successful
GTO Bots ever who played online like why
is that if GTO is the best game why
can't you just create this bot that
plays you know GTO Wizard or p p
strategy on every street and just Crush
everybody why such Bots have never come
to high Stakes or mid Stakes all the BS
that I've ever played against were
exploitative Bots like why why is that
if the GTO is the best strategy the idea
is that um GTO it teaches you a lot
about how to realize the equity of hands
how to build your strategy what sizes to
use who has to check once again who has
to protect his check why it is needed
why it is not needed you can learn a lot
from it but if you just try to copy it
and to do the same things that solar
does in your real life games it will not
really lead you anywhere it will make
you a better player than you were before
for sure but it will not make you great
player yeah people often draw wrong
wrong conclusions from the solutions
that they see in front of them they also
go in with the wrong mentality right
they want to know what what am I
supposed to do that's already the
mentality that they go in with and then
when they see the solution they think
that this is okay what I can learn from
this solution well this is how I this is
how I'm supposed to play which is a
wrong conclusion to come from right we
should just look at this as a model that
we can then study and we can start to
tweak and be like okay well if this is
optimal play and nobody reaches exact
optimal play Then in which people can
deviate or which people in which ways is
it very likely for people to deviate and
how can we take advantage of that those
are way more uh functional questions to
ask a solver yep anything you would like
to add to
that um no not really I think you've
covered it
well um when making decisions at the
poker
table what for you are the the most
important things to take in
consideration and what do you think is
something players assign way too much or
too little importance towards for
example you mentioned when Rec battling
you don't want to play too much Stables
because you want to pay attention to
timing of your opponent that could for
example be one of these things any of
the other things that send out yeah well
but you also should be careful with the
timing tals and not just drive conf
getting water I remember you said right
yeah and it's it's it's quite easy you
know to fool yourself our brains love to
fool them their selves themselves so
it's easy you know to see some time tell
that is not confirmed and then say okay
this was the reason why I made this
silly three Barrel expensive call down
because I thought that blah blah blah so
you have to be very confident about your
reads and assign them a value from 1 to
10 for example never view any s single
factor is like 10 out of 10 read that
leads to your decision usually it's like
okay I have this timing t it could be
right it could be wrong let's say the
accuracy is 6 out of 10 or seven out of
10 and then I have this read that I know
the sizing grid let's say the accuracy
is like five out of 10 maybe right maybe
wrong not sure and then you kind of try
to see um what decision would be the
best like you never know for sure pocker
is the game when you don't see the cards
of your opponents well it's obvious so
your goal is to make as well less
mistakes uh than you've done yesterday
so you you'll never be super precise but
you can be
1% uh more correct and that is a very
good thing on the long
run what I like about about your answer
and I think what a lot of players can
learn from is you didn't say anything
about if you think about what the solver
takes in consideration when making a
decision it's going to have a lot of
factors that as you think already kind
of pointed out does not really apply
right because the solver knows the
strategy the solver will get punished if
you adjust your strategy you talked way
more about the art of figuring out what
the [ __ ] your opponent has so you can
figure out what the [ __ ] you should do
right which are in my opinion the most
important question and is a sort of an
art that people have forgotten because
people just focus on yeah I have to play
my range I have to play this strategy I
have to I have to I have to whereas
you're more like um what does he have
and what and what based on that
information what can I do with my hand
right that SS up a little bit better
well I have to correct myself here if
this is what the way you've interpreted
my words because I like to uh give this
analogy of Poker skill or po poker being
like a house and GTO understanding of
how does one range interact with another
range who has the advantage not
Advantage what is the spr when do we
need to protect our check all these
things that you leave from the solver
this is the ground you know the basement
the ground base on top of which you
build your house this is
you know it without understanding this
like if you play this game trying to get
into opponent's head and without
understanding the fundamentals it will
not I mean it will not lead to anything
good so you must have a deep
understanding of the GTO but what I'm
saying is that just having a deep
understanding of GTO equals being a
theoretician without a practical you
know knowledge and skill without
actually going through this place and it
will not make you're a good player
because you need to apply exploits you
need to build walls you need to build
the roof you need to put the solar roof
to make the best exploit and go green
energy and exploit your opponents if you
just have your you know super solid um
basement base of your house it's well
it's good you will not get blown by the
wind but it will not make you a good
player as well yeah how I like to
explain it just like there's like forces
of nature that we have to oblig with
right right that's gravity it's a it's a
law of nature that we have to apply with
it's the same in poker there are certain
laws of theory that we have to
understand and we have to play Within
the laws of theory here and there right
for example the forces of equity there's
certain setups where the equity
advantage to one player is just huge and
if you don't respect that you're just
burning money I don't care which re you
have I don't care what kind of reason
you invent to do something different
you're just spewing money away but the
problem is that the equities or the
equity advantages disadvantages
they are really dependent on the Range
that we face and the range that we face
is really dependent on how they
constructed their range where people
often go wrong is they think well the
solver does that and therefore I do that
but they didn't take in consideration
that what's the actual range that I'm
facing Because the actual range that
you're facing determines the equities
which is going to determine what you
should be doing right and if you spend
no time in trying to figure out that
based on timing based on BET sizing Etc
based on information that your opponent
gives you what your Equity actually is
you learned all these things but you
missed the most important skill or at
least after we agree after the fundament
has been laid is to actually try to
figure out what your opponent has so you
can estimate what the equity is so you
can actually come up with the actual
proper correct decisions in this moment
not taking in any future considerations
that oh he's now seen you do this so
solver will flip 100% to a different
strategy that will expose your strategy
which doesn't really happen in
practice Yeah and another important
aspect that the higher you play the more
creative and smart your opponents are
going to be and let's like if we take
some theoretician who has played you
know one 1,000 hours against GTO trainer
and he comes to play ragar on an l2k and
let's say he plays against born to til
uh I I remember him using this strategy
like pob cat uh and check when he would
just pob C bet um like play Super
non-standard strategy and then just know
what to do against different opponents
or there was another very old school guy
I think his username was rif Chi one guy
from Russia he played like 30% cat
remember he he had like a 0% cat out of
position right in all spots was it him
well it was very low he but his overall
cat was 30 so probably maybe like less
than 10% and he was a very successful
player he was making good money I
remember having very nice win rates so
how would you like play if you trained
your brain to to memorize the solar
patterns to know like turn ranges reer
ranges and when we train against the GE
solar we subconsciously memorize uh the
place like when we make the mistake and
we see that it was a mistake our brain
it makes this note like okay here I
should do that but then you start
playing against people and your
intuition tells you like here you have
to call this is plus 1.23 BB per 100
call and you call and the bluff is never
there and you feel like okay this is the
variance I should go back to
Theory another player that stands out to
me e Centric BG remember him yeah he
used to limp a lot just he was like the
only guy or at least at high stakes he
would just limp except I think besides
the button and he would just only limp
which you know we could have a whole
argument about suboptimal yes no but he
was doing something that was different
than the rest so every and you know it
was only Ecentric who was doing it and
he wasn't at my table all the time so
when he was at the table like the
frequency that I would face him wasn't
high enough for me to really put in all
the hours to figure out okay how do I
beat the Centric so most probably he is
obviously he has F about this strategy a
lot so in every spot he would limp and I
would for example check my blind most
probably he had a way better idea of
what was going on than me so I would
always be trailing so that's kind of the
advantages of playing a strategy that
could be suboptimal but could be more
optimal in practice due to lack of
experience and lack of understanding how
the spot is actually supposed to be
played by your opposition uh because
it's kind of also in line with what you
said right yeah this is a spot that
people have played less and the less
you've played a spot the less you faced
the spot the more likely it is that you
will make a mistake so have you
throughout your
career deviated from Theory or use
strategies that were quote quote not a
thing just to put people out of their
comfort zone and does one maybe stand
out to you that you were like oh I was
always always doing that for example for
a long time I would always just three
bet the Razer so let's say for example a
guy opens 2.5 I would just make it five
big blinds so he would be playing a very
wide range out position in three B pot I
know
exactly what the range is how it's like
to screw up so while that was suboptimal
and I think actually this sub optimal
because getting a fault you know makes
you quite a lot of money and obviously
when I make it 2.5 to five I get no
fault but H slop I would I'll play him
quite a lot because he would be in a
situation he didn't know what to do and
I would be in a situation where I was
was very confident and knew what was
going to happen do you have any anything
like that that stands
out yeah actually I want to say two
things about it first is why like a
Centric BG strategy is good it's cool
you make some extra EV but why the
strategies are not enough be like to
become really one of the best the
problem is when you learn this exact
strategy your time is always limited so
you don't have time to learn the
standard spots and then you get owned by
lonus let's say who knows how to deviate
everywhere playing the standard lines
you know rays and three but pots so when
he gets to play against these players he
kind of La lacks The Experience himself
like he can get some EV from the limping
pods but then he would lose it back in
those spots that he did not study
himself because the time is limited so
that's the one thing yeah and uh yeah
I've tried many different you know
unconventional strategies throughout my
career limping from the early positions
with fish behind
uh works pretty good you know fish like
when you are on EP or MP and fish is
button or earlier so you get a lot of
squeezes when you rise and then you can
create a mixed range of limp and three
betat and race so yeah I've experimented
with that pretty successful I think and
then trying to three bat four 14 big
blinds from from uh big blind against
button and cut off back in 2018 like
before uh the solvers came out with this
idea because we've calculated it on the
preflop servers and tried to implement
the strategy but once again we did not
stick to it for some reason for a couple
of reasons yeah I'm a big I'm a big limp
Li limping fan so I definitely uh can uh
can acknowledge great strategy what has
been the most unconventional strategy
that you've applied and what did you
learn maybe it was successful or
unsuccessful what like the most
unconventional thing that you can think
of well that's a hard question something
very
unconventional probably well uh I don't
even
know I think limping on early positions
was quite unconventional maybe limping
on a button in rag Wars uh on anti
tables I think uh well I've done some
calculations made some ranges and tried
doing that I think it worked well but
you know the distance that I've had to
play was very short so it's hard to
tell yeah I remember I Tred I tried a
little bit of but lip it was funny with
me and my main stud study partner back
in the day I'm I'm sure you know
scarface. vot I'm sure you played a lot
with him right we were like best best
buddies did all did all our poker
strategy together and we would both try
to implement limping in in rack Wars on
the button but we did it for a different
reason I thought it was just cool you
know something different people play but
he said no man it's great because I Lim
the button and people don't want to play
and they just give me the table great
cuz then they said and then they say
yeah okay I'm not going to play you
three-handed forehanded if you start
limping the button so he obviously he's
like okay well then I limp the button
because I don't want to necessarily play
I just want to get the lobby whereas I
was like no okay if they ask me then it
means the game is not going to run so I
would stop limping the button so we had
a completely different a different
mindset towards it he would always see
it left from the big piig like yeah I
don't want to battle I just want to get
this Lobby you know I'm gonna play a
10hour session I don't I want to waste
my time on this whereas I was way more
like strategically curious and like no
I'm going to limp the button and then
this can happen that can happen you know
and then when they would say I don't
want you to Lim the button else I quit I
would stop Lim the button because I
wanted to play so it was it was
interesting like a completely different
um yeah a different holistic holistic
approach hi guys Renee AKA Deo here with
a quick mechanics of Poker 2.0
announcement in our program you will get
access to 80 plus hours of content in
which we will explain you all aspects
needed in order to become a more
successful Pok player now one of these
of course is the technical aspect of the
game in which I'll be explaining you all
the mechanics behind poker strategies
we'll be talking about GTO exploitive
play with an extra focus on the why
behind certain strategies and why the
population has certain leaks and to
increase your whim rate even further
we've recently added the River Bluff and
Bluff catching section so you can
increase your MV when those pots become
very big our mindset and performance
coach Adam carmichel he took care of the
mental game and performance section of
this program in which he will teach you
everything you need to know in order to
break through limiting beliefs better
handle your emotions break free from
tilt and play your aame more
consistently and last but not least
we've added a management and
optimization section in the program in

continuously improve as a poker player
now on top of that this concept is
continuously evolving based on feedback
and suggestions we get from our
community next to all this content you
will have access to our exclusive
Discord Community monthly live Q&A calls
and one-on-one coaching session in which
we are going to be reviewing if you have
been implementing the stuff that we
teach you in the mechanics of Poker
correctly so do you think you have what
it takes to master the mechanics of
Poker poker go over to mechanics ofp
poker.com and maybe you will get a
chance to work with me and Adam and make
more progress in your poker career but
for now without further Ado let's get
back into more goodness in today's
episode you've done a lot of coaching
and I think we already touched on a
couple of things um but what are maybe
next to the study algorithm what are
like the three most important lessons or
concepts that you explain your
students um from this like judging by
the students feedback I think the
psychological aspect um was very
important
like um yeah many people say that some
things about the psychology about the
approach of tables approach was even
well not less beneficial than the
technical approach then the algorithm
how to study how to get the most out of
every minute you spent uh on the game
and then just you know getting the solid
technical base because given the
foundation and deep understanding of GTO
and then how to build exploits and
psychology so these are three main
cornerstones I'd say you mentioned a lot
about uh psychology you also mentioned a
little bit before in our conversation
about the brain you I know you you
studied a lot about the brain
so how do does the brain screw up in
poker well small remark I would not say
that I like studied a lot I think uh my
level is better than like fish but it's
it's not higher than an l00 or even an
l50 regular just know the main ideas
main Concepts like the do dopamine and
serotonin system and how we try how we
should try balance between them and how
we should try the optimal time to play
and when not to play so the way uh
answering your question the way our
brain messes up is through the so-called
cognitive biases and this is like the
whole area to study uh which
is well we can call it critical thinking
uh going back to you know the book
Thinking Fast and Slow by canaman which
is very I think popular among po poer
players or uh I I'd even mention my
favorite my all-time favorite lectures
on critical Thinking by Steven
Noella um basically they explain these
two authors explain how our brains fool
themselves what type of biases exist and
there are so many biases that were
formed through the evolution that helped
us to survive in the past but that do
not really help us at the tables like
when we get this feel of fight or flight
hit like fight or run in a three but pot
on the river playing deep deep stack
because our reptile brain tells us that
losing money equals higher chances to
die equals do not do that avoid that run
feel Rush of adrenaline and it's not
good for pocker we we would like we
would prefer to play like like robots so
this is one of the ideas and then the
confirmation bias is actually one of my
favorite ones uh the idea of it is that
our brain it has some belief and it's
subconsciously always notices this
belief but always subconsciously ignores
factors that contradict this belief and
this is what makes people mess up when
they work with Statistics a lot when
they use the data mining like they can
find some idea and then just start
believing in it and then when they play
their brain actually does not notice
this thing but it notices everything
that confirms their beliefs so they kind
of Lie to themselves and feel that they
are right
I think in this book yeah yeah yeah go
ahead I think in this lectures by stepen
Noella the example with confirmation
bias was like imagine a couple guy and a
girl and they leave together and then uh
guy says that look I always uh put the
toilet seat up and the girl says no you
never put it up like I have to always
remind you and they both believe that
they are right and their partner is
wrong like that they always do it but
partner never does that but in in real
real it it's not true obviously they
both do it with a some percentage of
time I've I've tried to explain this
concept of confirmation confirmation bi
to my wife a couple of times for this
exact reason like yeah but you highlight
the
times I I remember pointed it out once
once too I think it was it was poker CLA
guy a guy I've done a lot of work with
as well we we were sharing sharing an
office and he would say ah he would go
he would go grab a coffee and he said oh
man the water in the coffee is always
finished I'm like dude I can't believe
do I have to explain how this works
though right like every time when the
water is finished that's when you notice
you don't notice when the water is not
finished and especially I think in in in
relationships is very important because
we often just don't notice the thing we
take things for granted and then we only
notice when something is lacking and
then it feels like it's always lacking
or you never do this you never do that
so it's even bigger than than just poker
to come back to Poker though you
mentioned two big big bias
how do we fix
it I'd like to add one more if I may the
sun cost bias when we invest money in a
pot and then the more money we invested
the harder it is to get away from this
pot I think it's also one of the major
Leakes and uh yeah it's the most popular
league for people who shoot up the
stakes who go higher and when they start
playing it's really hard for them to
make faults I think uh I've discussed
this notion with many high stakes
players like I would ask my friends in
your experience when you see a guy from
lower Stakes shooting higher Stak uh
what do you think he is likely to be
wrong about is he going to overall or is
he going to overfall like if you take
some average guy without any information
is he going to overbluff or is he going
to under Bluff so guys what do you think
about it I'd like to ask you the same
question you're asking me or you asking
the audience I mean you and Adam and the
audience can ask in the comments for
sure so I I feel I feel like it's more
likely is going to
underfold and I feel it's more likely is
going to under Bluff those would be my
answers Adam jump in yeah I say he's
most likely to under Bluff um and I
think he probably overfall I'd go for
overfall just for risk aversion and the
kind of cost of making errors often
plays into
it
so what's the answer SII we're dying
know yeah so it's quite an a
counterintuitive thing I think uh it
it's like
70% uh of people are going to um over
Bluff and over over Bluff cage and then
30% are going to do the
opposite oh so it's always it's always
in
line so basically they always show the
same
behavior well we have S % of people who
are going to be way too lose if I can
call it like that and 30% who are going
to be way too tight so on average I
think we have some you know uh some uh
how to say some informational Edge that
on average people are likely to be a bit
more loose than they should than they
are on their own stake regular stake
especially from like the hero calling
perspective I mean we talked about this
on the podcast a lot they put their
opponent on a pedestal or often they
feel like they need to do something
special so they need to find this Bluff
combo they they assume that you know
they're playing as jaser jaser high six
Legend you know I have to call him down
I cannot get overrun this kind of
psychology definitely plays a part
before I hand it over to Adam because
I'm sure he's like oh let me include me
in this conversation I love biases I
wanted to quickly touch on how in your
experience and how would you go about
fixing those so we talked uh about the
the sun cost policy we talked about
confirmation bias and we talked about
risk verion due to our reptile brain not
wanting to lose money so any tips for
the audience because I'm sure everyone
struggles to that to a certain
degree yeah so first tip is what we've
uh spoken in the beginning of this
conversation and about um writing down
the stimulus and reaction and why was it
wrong and how we should fix it and then
doing the Reps doing the repetitions to
actually do it again again again and uh
stop and at Le decrease the number of
mistakes that make that's number one
number two I would say working with a
cognitive behavioral psychologist or
reading the literature about it there is
a great book it's called Feeling Good by
uh Eric Burns this book has many um
exercises that you can do by yourself
and on daily basis and work with your
biases I think is great and then also I
would add the critical thinking books
and lectures learning about your biases
before um
fighting with them is also important
because we've named just three and there
are like dozens of them yeah and also
fighting with them so the fight the
fight should have happened before you
started playing if you try to fight them
when when you're in the spot you're
going to lose 100% so we talked a lot
about stimulus response I remember I
don't know where I got this from but we
have to create space between the
stimulus and response because within
that space we can observe and reflect to
see if what is this emotion so um also
before when then playing I think a very
common mistake that players make is they
say oh I shouldn't be doing this or I
should be doing that and they go in I
will not call the River today something
like that or I will not I will not get
angry when I get sucked out and that
that's that's how they try to go in in
the first time you know they really
trying to hold on maybe it works second
time and then before you know it they're
back to Old parents F like you have to
come up with a different response to the
situation so I remember I would always
write down like thought Replacements or
action Replacements and now do X but I
want that's the trigger so there's space
between which you can practice for
example through meditation you so you
can observe like hey this is the trigger
I'm aware of my triggers I'm aware of
how I feel this is my default response
what would be a response that's more in
line with achieving me achieving my
long-term goals for example so you can
have certain thoughts to certain
situations and you can start to think
different uh we we done we touched
actually a lot of on a lot of good
points in the podcast we did with sunny
I believe he spended a lot of time time
on this Adam
your I mean sergy gave his top three
biases that hinder poker players any
biases you would like to add and any
tips that you would like to share in
your experience how poker players can
fight biases at the
tables well what a fascinating topic and
sergy did a really great job of outl
Ling how biases work what are some of
the most common biases how to work
through them and yeah it's a fascinating
area to explore and I like to think of
the biases in almost like two categories
I've done a lot of work on trying to
figure out what biases affect poker
players how they affect them and you can
almost split the bies into two
categories one is biases of the ego this
also factors in survival factors fight
or flight stuff this is often when
you're fighting back confirmation bias
you want to protect yourself it's all
about uh a survival protection ego kind
of construct of biases and these are all
just basic protection and they they
triggered by that kind of uh ego
dominance then there's another whole set
of um biases which I would call faulty
mental models which are blind spots and
blind spots are based on the information
you've seen information you haven't seen
and this is often how the brain uh
calculates information so for example if
I see a showdown and somebody Bluffs me
on the river I go ah he's always
bluffing me I I see the information and
I use the information I've seen to
almost extract that was what happens or
anchoring bias someone uses a big bet
size on the Flop and I get anchor to Oh
we must be strong here so we see a small
part of information and we don't see the
blind spot which is hidden and the
brands always making shortcuts and
trying to Fast Track information so uh
we have another set of information sorry
biases or fult man models that occur
through blind spots so I think it's as
sery mentioned you've got to do a little
exploration and almost go through all
the literature of the biases and which
ones apply to you and then start to
unpack them so the way I like to do it I
like to go what is the bias like it's
really good to understands why the why
the bias occurs because the mind isn't
like doing this like stupidly it's doing
it to protect you from either survival
mechanisms or it's doing it from a blind
spot and once you understand where it's
coming from it really it gets you to
move past it so for example if we look
at confirmation bias which is very
common what is it so this is where we
seek opinions and ideas that back up our
own thoughts all right so we if someone
gives me information that says Adam
you've done that right I go yes thank
you if someone goes Adam that was a bad
you played that badly I go sorry sorry
what was that didn't hear you got gone
out of the window so we confirmed that
so why why do we do that this is because
it protects the ego it makes us feel
smart it makes us feel clever we don't
feel challenged we like to know be smart
and know what to do so uh that is kind
of the framework of it but what's the
cost of not working on it the cost is
we're now reminded we don't learn New
Perspectives we don't learn new opinions
we don't learn new ideas so then you go
how does that show up at the pocket
tables well you go okay well if I'm
talking hands and strategy just with
people who agree with me I'm going to
have a very one-sided perspective if
people give me insights or different
perspectives let's say I play a regular
who's got a very good win rate on my
player pool but he does things
differently to me and I go bad Rag and I
go he's he's he's rubbish I've missed
the opportunity to learn from this this
regular because I am I'm confirming what
I do and not what he does so then the
the kind of solution is how do I take
action to correct that bias and once you
spot it it's often very easy so for
example confirmation bias is how do I
seek opinions that differ from my own
how do I drop my ego aside and have
conversations with people I
fundamentally disagree with and you find
a lot of people struggle with this when
it comes to politics when it comes to
religions when it comes with money when
it comes with your poker strategy if
you're very attached to it and people
find it hard to go against it so you got
to find in the port context ideas that
differ from yours so yeah I think it's
really important conversation of
understand the biases that apply to you
I'd say a few to add on that we haven't
spoke about one would be like hindsight
bias or outcome bias where you basically
use results to validate whether you're
playing well or what your your strategy
is good so for example you uh do a big
Bluff on the river he falls you go yes
great Bluff awesome or oppos calls and
you go idiot why did I do that and
though you know you're playing a range
you only see one combo and you go you
judge your strategy based on the combo
and then you get annoyed or happy based
on that so trying to work on the results
side and not get to driven to outcomes
but yeah there's a whole there's a whole
other kind of spectrum in terms of um so
negativity bias is the one where we
basically uh we always focus on the
negative we focus on what went wrong
whether what went right we've got a kind
of pre-built in nature to steer towards
negativity which helped our species
survive so for example if I see a lion
by the river and I remember that awesome
danger danger danger don't go there
that's inbuilt to remember that so the
same with our minds we uh generally
gravitate towards remembering negative
outcomes and again that can lead to a a
whole host of negative inner dialogue of
self- defeated talk I would do a lot of
my coaching on with players who uh have
inner dialogues which are very defeatist
they make a mistake they're super
critical they beat themselves up it
leads a lot of emotions frustration um
but yeah a I could rant on for for a
long time on these because there's so
many but I think s did a great job in
terms of thinking fast and slow is a
great in point in terms of mapping out
the framework and understand how the
brain works what biases apply to you I
think is a a good exercise and a very
worthwhile tool for all poker players to
to go down Adam I I have a question for
you uh when we talk about like he's a
talented poker player or talent in poker
can we then directly relate that to he's
just in general less sensitive to bias
would that be a
talent I would say it's a skill it's so
hard to distinguish between obviously
like we can so we can enhance our with
skill but let's say for example when we
talk about pure talent someone just rose
up to the ranks seems more talented
could it be that a talent is that a
person is less sensitive to bias or
experiences less bias than other his
brain is just in a way less his brain is
functions Less in the normal society but
functions better in a game of poker 100%
so I I class cing bies I call them
faulty mental models because it allows
us to realize oh there's a model that my
mind's using that is a bit faulty that I
can change so I'd say a lot of talented
players have more mental models that are
more conducive to PO success they've got
a framework of thinking in logic in
strategic ways that is less Primal less
ego- driven less blind spots clim up and
they've got basically a a better mental
model of mental mapping of how to think
in spots and CR critically uh analyze
and think I think that's almost
certainly the case now whether that's a
skill they were born with or a talent
they were born with or they've developed
that through other games other skills
other life experiences is very hard to
tell probably a combination of both but
almost certainly they've got a a better
mental toolkit and less me fental models
that impact the decision
making all right I want to bring it back
now to uh reflecting on your PO career
we've covered so many topics and we've
basically extracted so much knowledge
from you already but I want you to go
back and just think about some of the
most important things you've learned for
your PO career so for you you mentioned
struggling with your mindset throughout
your career and I'm guessing with this
you also had maybe some belief systems
that were holding you back I know for
myself I always created like ceilings
that I'm only capable of playing that
level or I'm only capable of making that
much money and it would always hold me
back for long periods of time until I
realized it was just like a belief
system that was hold me back for you
what's the uh biggest belief system
you've had to overcome come in order to
progress with your PO
career um there were a few I can
remember of one of them was that I don't
have a poker Talent equals I will not be
able to compete on the highest level and
my understanding of talent is from it
comes from the practical way from like
talking and walking and studying
together with people who I deem more
talented like
uh or let's say people who are natural
in understanding poker on an intuitive
level for example the two most talented
guys who I know in poker one is fish
20133 and one and another is Stefan so
fish he could understand pocker on oh
and true teller of course but I don't
know him personally but he is obviously
a poker genius so um for fish 2013
before any solver appeared he could they
sacked the game into pieces and
understand it on a very fundament deep
fundamental level so he had a very big
Edge before any of the software came out
just from you know having a neck to
understanding games with um how to say
it hidden in not full information like
poer and math and being very smart
person overall and then there is Stefan
for example who came to poker in the ER
of solvers um what makes him talented is
the speed that it takes him to learn for
example I remember that we would take a
coaching session from our friend from
another discipline not six Max cash but
who is a very strong theoretician and
then he would explain some idea and
Stefan would like get it instantly and
to me it would take like 3x more time to
get it or we would discuss some Concepts
it's just the speed uh with which person
processes the information and some
individual uh things that make him stand
out another example comes to my mind is
for Haley he has some incredible memory
like incredible memory he would remember
hands you know suits played many years
ago um yeah and this is something I've
never had so uh talking to these people
I would think that okay I probably don't
have what it takes to to be one of the
best so that's what one of the things
and what I've ignored here that there
could be some other things that I'm not
aware of that I have that could help me
to get the edge in something else maybe
I feel my opponent better maybe my
discipline allows me to get some extra
Edge from studying more efficiently
maybe you know maybe there is something
else I don't even know what it was but
it helped me um that's number one number
two I think the memory I would always
think that well my memory is not great
so this is probably something that will
not help me become one of the best
number three would be the notion that in
order to be the best you need to work
hours a day have no life and just say
bye-bye to your friends and family so
sounds like an excuse that my brain has
created
constructed and yeah these are the three
I can think of right
now so so good and yeah I think as you
were speaking there it's so interesting
to uh relay how it's just like a story
narrative so for you you mentioned like
I don't have a pocket Talent my memory
is not great to be the best is like a
lot of lot of hard work these are like
just like kind of stories we can like
fix say to and when we have that in our
mind we often seek evidence or we see
evidence in our environment that
confirms it as you mentioned before
confirmation bias so you look at like
the best players in the world and go
don't have a marate that guy heav got
the pock of talent that stepan's got
haven't got the work ethic of the
highest volume guy in my game and we can
use that to reconfirm a limited belief
system but as you mentioned what you're
missing is what are your hidden talents
like nor players the complete package
maybe someone is but maybe a likess or
somebody but most players have strengths
and weaknesses all of us do in some
capacity so then you got to go what
makes me uniquely talented to pursue po
at a high level so for you when you were
going past these belief systems I'm
guessing to some degree they were still
in the back of your mind as you're
moving up the stakes what were the
beliefs you had to uh reinforce in
yourself to get past them if you didn't
think you were talented or had a good
memory I know you worked on fixing those
how did you instill install a better
belief system to allow you to move
forward well first of all was to
recognize these uh beliefs and then to
cancel them out basically in the first
video that I made on my YouTube channel
I've described this exercise when you
write them down and then you cross them
out with a pencil and write why it is
not true and this is the idea I've
gotten from some seminars on like
self-development whatever and U I think
once again it's like a Compound Effect
you read some books you talk to people
you try different stuff something works
something doesn't and at some point you
understand not just logically but on
both logical and emotional levels that
your beliefs are actually false and this
is the story you're telling yourself to
just cross it out from your mind and
just keep working just try trying other
methods and then you see the results
like okay it works now I see a bit Edge
at least against some people I never
seen the edge before and now it works
and what could I do better and then you
get this gamble you know know you you
you get like excited and you you are
excited about growing about getting
better inch by
inch yeah and I think it's like beliefs
can create a barrier like a a wall or a
ceiling that stops you moving forward
and as you mentioned like the process of
identifying them Crossing them out and
replacing them with a new one is one of
the most powerful things you can do for
your life because we all hold on to
certain beliefs based in our childhood
our upbringing our past experiences that
in some capacity limit our growth for
the next chapter the next stage we're
trying to grow into and if we don't
examine them we often just hit a wall
and we're like I can't move forward but
really it's like ah this is a belief
system that's there that's creating a
barrier how do I move past that and it
can be as simple as yeah deciding what
you want to believe and I think as Rena
mentioned as well like what we focus on
is what we feel we've talked about
gratitude in this conversation as well
and the same applies for belief systems
when you fix in on what you want to
believe and you start to look for
evidence to support that you start to
see it so for example I've heard players
say things like oh I'm not not smart
enough to move up Stakes let's say
they're playing 500L and they want to
move to 1ks and they say I'm not
talented enough I'm not smart enough to
move up Stakes but they've already moved
up Stakes eight times in their career
they s of $10 the 20s the 50s the
hundreds and they've got a proven track
record with them themselves that they
can learn a new strategy beat the level
above and keep learning and growing and
itating their strategy yet they get to a
point where they go it's too hard now I
can't do that and they start fixating on
this guy's really good he's too talented
but in reality if they fixated on I've
learned how to beat levels before i' no
matter how hard it gets I can learn it
again it's the same process and doubling
down on that I think is yeah so valuable
but I think Coming to Terms your beliefs
is super important in terms
of things that stopped you moving
forward so you mentioned we've already
touched on a little bit but this kind of
block when you got stuck at the hundreds
for nine months was there any belief
systems there that held you back in
terms of looking back that stopped you
progressing or was it just like strategy
that was was lacking at the
time I can't really recall because it
was what 12 years ago but definitely
technical some not not understanding
some technical stuff and psychology had
a big role for sure so maybe
50/50 not really
remember what do you wish you had a
known about poker starting out on day
one when you let's say when you go pro
after you finished your studies from
University what would you wish you had a
know if you could impart some wisdom
onto your younger self on that day well
I would increase uh the time invested in
Psychology for sure like 10-fold because
it was very the percentage of the time
was like super slow to non-existent when
I was starting out first years I was
just not respecting it enough and it was
one of the biggest
mistakes um what else I'm not sure
because all the technical stuff all the
understanding in the prolar era came
from trying and you know trial and error
way so any mistakes that I've made they
were you know a bricks in a wall to
let's say Mastery of the game at some
point so cannot really call the mistakes
except for the 30% cat strategy that was
just
done but so the version of you today I'm
guessing has learned a lot of lessons
from your poker career which lesson are
you most proud of or pleased with that
you've learned throughout your poker
career
um well I think
understanding this notion that you
should learn to get pleasure from the
pain from losing like you should
actually get pleasure or at least zero
EV on emotional level you should not
feel negative your losses should
motivate you and push you forward and
the more you get beaten down the more
you should the more often you should
rise up and become even stronger and the
that the only one one way to succeed in
any uh Endeavor that involves um human
competition or Mastery is through trial
and error and through mistakes that
mistakes are not bad mistakes are
inevitable is an mistake is an
inevitable part of your progression
that's
it so how do you begin to derive
pleasure from Pain let say someone
listen to this suffers a lot when they
have a bad beat or they have a loose and
pocket session and they struggle to see
any value from the pain they're
experiencing how do you start to uh be
constructive and learn to uh derive some
pleasure or at least even neutral from
painful
scenarios well in order to do that you
need to restructure your understanding
of success and you need to see the
Success Through the land of getting
better 1% at a time not like from going
from zero 0 to 100 or to 70 but just
getting 1% better than your version one
day prior so each time you make a
mistake once you have analyzed you've
marked your hands you you've went
through them you analyzed them you learn
something and it means that you've
actually become better today than you
were yesterday and this mistake that
you've done it's not guaranteed that you
will not repeat it most likely you will
and not once but um at some point the
neurons in your head in your brain they
will get in the right order and then you
will not repeat this mistake again so if
you made you know some bad plays during
the session and you feel beaten you
should tell yourself that tomorrow you
will be better than you were yesterday
and this beating it's inevitable like
when you do box and whatever you cannot
learn without getting beaten it's fine
just just deal with it and and just
enjoy it like you got hit all right but
I got better cool let's move on hit me
more I I can do more let's see how much
can I take so this type of
mentality yeah and I think it's
understanding that pain plus reflection
equals growth but you've got to do some
reflectant on the pain and the thing
about it is it's so obvious what you
need to do because the pain itself is
like the Something's Happened Here I
need to think about this H either change
my strategy or change how I'm
approaching this so it doesn't happen
again and yeah I really like that kind
of
remember that life's a game of 1% edges
getting that 1% better no. 1% better and
it's not a perfect formula you make the
same mistake multiple times before you
fix it but the process of trying to
reflect and learn from pain is what
leads to that long-term growth so yeah I
really like that I think it's a very
useful and very practical thing that
players can work on so what would you
say to people who uh it's actually from
the book that we've talked about think
Thinking Fast and Slow which talks about
the concept of losing feels twice as bad
as winning feels good so like kind of
psychology is like when we lose like say
a dollar or $10 it feels twice as bad as
winning that same amount so how would
you say we reconcile with that that
losing generally feels a lot worse than
winning feels good in terms of making it
a practical learning tool for
ourselves well I think it just takes the
cognitive you know behavioral
psychological practice working by
yourself or with the psychologist I mean
it is a deep work there is no easy
solution you cannot get some drug that
will fix it you have to go through it
the only one thing I can say that might
cheer up many people is the way is my
perception of how ideas work uh because
playing in a in in some way in some
exact way equals idea like if you want
to fault here you have an idea that
people under Bluff and how do ideas
emerge in our brains um they emerge by
learning but what is learning if you
make this mistake one time it doesn't
mean that you will never make it again
you you probably will make it or let's
say you made this mistake and your
friend tells you okay you made this
mistake and you say yes I know I will
not make it but then you make it again
and let's say now you watch some video
or I don't know read a book on you know
any other topic like business and you
read about the same way of thinking and
you're like oh yes I know that mistake I
know that I make it too but I will not
make it in the future and chances are
you will make it in the future but here
is how it works each time you get the
idea repeated by the different Source it
strengthens your neur um your neurons
you know your um how to say it in
English it's a bit complicated for me
like you you strengthen uh the way your
neurons are positioned the chains of
your neurons and you never know how many
um confirmations of the idea you
actually need to make it work on both
emotional and logical level and I like
to bring an analogy here with the
blockchain or Bitcoin for example when
you send a Bitcoin to somebody it need
to get some confirmations until it gets
let's say seven confirmations out of
seven the transaction will not be
completed same thing is the way ideas
work until you get X number of
confirmations you may be still making
these mistakes but but you should know
that you will reach this point um and
you will stop making this mistake so do
not be desperate if you're making the
same dumb mistake five times in a row
keep trying and sooner or later it will
be
fixed I think the key part there as well
is to keep trying because as you
mentioned like when you're trying to fix
a mistake you taking a New Perspectives
and different approaches and different
information as long as you're looking
for Solutions should hopefully at some
point get you towards like a resolution
let's say for example someone's
overweight and they know they're
overweight and they try every different
fat of diet but nothing ever works
there's almost like a defe attitude or a
defe mindset or a belief system that
stops them from actually wanting to lose
weight or learn about it in a deep way
that's going to have a solution and the
same with mistakes if you're someone who
let's say I always call down light on
rivers and You' just accepted that as
part of who you are no matter how many
information you hit here from different
sides or ways to approach it if you're
not looking to fix it you're not
actually trying to find a resolution it
just kind of goes over your head so I
think it's like the wanting to fix a
problem and yes you might need like lots
of different ideas and ways of learning
about something before you fix it but as
long as you're on that path of trying to
reflect and learn from mistakes I 100%
agree that um yeah different angles at
some point will create enough
connections to uh find that solution and
just being being patient with that
process is is very
valuable yes and thank you that was a
very important Edition a very important
uh comment that we must at first
recognize the problem and we want to fix
it because many many people they just
say oh there is no problem I'm just
unlucky or any other
excuse yeah and it's also like we can't
fix every problem at the same time so be
very concise I want to fix this problem
for this period of time this is what I'm
struggling with and yeah being
intentional uh is very very important
with that as well so for you right now
I'm very curious to know um what a day
looks like I know you've got a different
day to what you did when you are
grinding but you seem like somebody who
goes about your life very intentional
and I'm trying to think like how you uh
optimize your performance and what you
do so uh maybe we could talk touch on
the most important habits you have on a
daily basis so the things you do that
drive either happiness you feeling good
or your ability to perform either
cognitiv or physically anything that's
you do on a daily basis that is align
with that yeah so three things I do on a
daily basis well even four I'd say one
is gratitude if I forget to do it in the
morning I try to do it before going to
sleep second is uh I'm trying to have
any type of sport at least six days a
week and the harder the better and the
third thing is the um understanding of
the detrimental side of the Comfort if I
can call it like that um which means
that every day I try to do something
uncomfortable right now it's uh the cold
shower that I do like very very cold
shower before going to sleep and I if I
see any other things that I can do I try
to do them as well like for example
couple days ago I've read about this
idea like our ancestors used to train uh
they used to put backpacks that weighed
like 20 kilos and then walk with them
and then there is the scientific
research that says that the chance of
trauma is very low when you do that
compared to running so I decided to try
that and I went for like 3 hour uh bike
and walk uh with uh like 8 kilograms
weight and it was hard but like the
harder the better it makes you stronger
so these three things that I try to do
every day yeah very very nice habits
there and yeah I think it's
understanding for each of us we probably
have probably three to five daily habits
we can do on a regular basis that will
allow us to feel good and perform good
and you got to find those ones for you
and do them regularly and it should be
like part of your routine uh the same
way of brushing your teeth is part of
your routine um yeah for me it's
meditation it's time Outdoors it's daily
exercise um yeah there's the main ones
to be honest in terms of things I do
every day to make myself feel good um so
I think it's really good to uh find that
Rhythm for you which you've obviously
found for yourself reney for you I know
you're new to fatherhood and things are
very disrupted so I'm probably going to
throw you on the spot in terms of what
you're currently doing but how is your
current rhythm of your days and things
that you do on a regular basis to allow
yourself to feel good it was funny that
you pointed it out because if I head is
like yeah changing diapers as like uh as
like a little bit of sarcasm in there
yeah my my my routines and stuff have
been a little bit all over the place I
think I've experimented
with almost anything I guess I guess the
main one that still stands is cold
showers uh but to be fair no I'm gonna
scrap that one it's not really a habit
because I live in Rio Janeiro at the
moment it's just [ __ ] hot outdoor all
the time so a cold shower I think cold
showers only count if you live in a cold
country that's for example when I was
living in nland I would take cold
showers or when I was living in Malta
and it was cold outside that's when cold
showers count here it's like first of
all the water isn't that cold that comes
out of a shower anyway in a very warm
country I had this problem actually in
Malta all the time as well in Malta and
the summer you cannot you just cannot
refresh yourself no there's no cold
water it doesn't exist so here is the
same like the water is cold but it's not
that cold meditation on and off yeah I
would say the only things that usually
only really stick with me even in the
hardest times which I guess you know
fatherhood of a two- Monon year-old I
guess we could describe as like
disruptive times right where a lot of
things are no longer in your control you
know you have your kit to take in
consideration your wife and stuff like
that other things in life uh get that
keeps interrupting with your schedule
think exercise to a certain degree now
obviously I'm not it's more maintenance
than anything else eating health
always
sticks sleep to be honest I do try to
still prioritize even though as you kind
as you might imagine a baby crying a
little bit in the middle of the night is
a little bit disruptive but I do try to
still prioritize that so I would say
sleep diet exercise these three pillars
It's usually the main thing that need
that I need to have in place regardless
of the situation um and then if I do if
everything is in place and I do for
example
few more of a need to perform like
there's things I have to show up for for
example take this podcast you know then
I make sure that I sleep better I make
sure that I'm more disciplined make sure
I go to bed earlier or make sure I did
try at least you know I do try at least
get the cold shower or actually another
routine that I like is every morning go
for a walk outside I think that one is
really really helpful as well so first
thing in the morning I get my dog and we
we go out get some sunshine uh I think
this really works so for example this
spot was a little bit on the earlier
side for me but then I prefer to wake go
to bed earlier wake up earlier and go
for a walk with my dog instead of
skipping it I think these are the these
are the main things that I stood out
other than that like I said I think I've
experimented with with most things
gratitude meditation all through through
phases in my life I would say um
wrapping wrapping this podcast off uh
sergy going forward what are some of
your uh goals in life what are you most
passionate about and want to focus more
time
on um well just like you I'm uh
expecting to become a young father soon
maybe next month even all right congrats
or this month if things go yeah
unexpectedly well if I can say so so
yeah life is going to change um well I
have in my plans to read a couple of
books about how to raise children want
to be good in that and then just
concentrate on uh coaching in pocker and
then YouTube channel try to put up at
least one video per two weeks and then
doing sports trying to keep up with the
new um with the new how to say obstacles
with the new changes in my life trying
to not to skip um Sport and have time
for myself and my wife living quality
life yeah it really it really a kid
really helps you realign your priorities
for example something that I cut out
which I noticed I was spending just way
too much time
on which actually I'm not really sure
where it has a place but I I really love
football I follow a lot of football but
I was just following so much football
news and and YouTube and stuff like that
this probably the first thing that I cut
out I have less time also like just
mentally in your brain less input so you
start to prioritize things in your life
and really yeah you you start to
reinvent your schedule but yeah the
weird thing is like everything is around
so when you're perform especially in
poker you know everything is around you
right it's me me me you always and now
suddenly you have something else that's
more important so that that's the
biggest shift also like in terms of
identity rise right you identify
yourself with a high performer a
productive guy and now you suddenly make
the Swift in identity now you have to
become a present loving father for
example actually a Bo book
recommendation for you the daily Deb I
don't know do you know any of the books
of Ryan holiday UPS scores the way ego
is the enemy silence is the key and I I
think I missed one daily stoic he also
has do you know this guy yeah I've read
e is the enemy yeah I know him I've
listened to some of his podcast too yeah
actually he also he has a he has a daily
dad newsletter that you can sign up to
but the the book The Daily dad is pretty
good it's like it's just like the daily
stoic every day there's just one page
gives you like some stoic information uh
every month is a different topic I
Remember December that was the first
month that was very dark it was all
about basically every day there was a
story about like someone would die there
was every there was a story and it
basically you know it meant like listen
appreciate this moment you know hold
your hold your child in your hand
because you know tomorrow it could be
over that was kind of always a Mor of
the story but then every every every
month in January I think the topic was
well how you want your kid to be you
should show up as an example so classic
you know people say no I don't want my
child to to spend all day on cell phones
and you spend all day on your cell phone
so like basically they're they're just
going to become a copy of you in my my
case she literally was a copy of me
because if you would put pictures next
to each other it's identical uh but in
terms of behavior yeah you know you have
to you have to show the good example so
those would be like uh like some tips
for tips for me to you
um closing off what would you like the
main takeaway to be the audience gets
from the conversation we had
today get acquainted with the discomfort
and pain and learn always learn from it
do not View as something bad mistakes
rejections failures equals experience
and not something detrimental to your
success anything you would like to add
to that Adam or any things that you
would like to add before we close it off
no that was a perfect summary and points
for the audience to work on so thank you
very much for your time sergy we really
appreciate it we went deep on lot of
topic and you shared a lot of wisdom so
we thank you for your time thanks for
watching guys I've had a lot of Joy with
you thank
you great conversation that was with
serg AKA jaser a lot of knowledge
dropped again as usual Adam anything
that sticked out to you as a main
takeaway well we went deep into a lot of
mindset issues and his journey into
developing a strong mindset very
interesting that he talked about himself
struggling with psychology and mindset
for 68 years I think was the time frame
he was having problems so yeah the tools
he developed I think were really
practical and I think one of them was
the mental game hand history sort of
thing where he was basically Notting all
his kind of triggers stimulus and how
they were affecting him in game he had a
nice system for basically reframing and
rewiring the meaning he was given events
you can go back through and watch that
bit another part he was talking about
was biases again I won't go into all of
them because he went quite deep onto all
different biases but understanding how
your brain works and the things that
impact your decision- making whether
they come from the ego or whether they
come from blind spots I think super
important as a poker player as we think
we're very logical people who make very
strategic decisions but in reality we've
got a lot of biases emotions and things
that impact our decision making so
bringing them to the Forefront is really
important so you can make good decisions
another thing that I thought was
interesting was his gratitude practice
and this happiness scoring that he had I
think that's very super interesting in
terms of how he scores his happiness
every single day and he writes down
things that correlate with the high
score things that Corr with the low
score yeah I think this is a a really
good thing that I probably will start in
myself because it's one of those things
where you mentioned as well if if you
focus on something you almost like feel
good about it or you bring more
intentionality and gratitude in
particular is one of those things that
we often neglect the good things that
are already happening in our lives in
pursuit of the thing that's going to
happen next so we put ourselves in the
future State when I achieve this I will
feel happy in reality there's a lots of
things happening right now which you can
feel happy content with which I think's
a really good balancer for a lot of us
ambitious striving going for that next
goal kind of people myself included so I
think it's really good to remind
ourselves of what makes us happy now and
to install a bit of a gratitude practice
and the final thing was kind of towards
the end of the conversation he talked
about learning how to lose as a PO of
skill that he's learned and also taking
pleasure from pain I think that's a very
practical thing to work towards of how
can we learn to see the utility in pain
because as a poker player a lot of it is
suffering going to lose a lot you're
going to have bad sessions you're going
to make mistakes there is an inbuilt
pain in the process of trying to get
better at the game and it take pleasure
in that Pursuit by knowing I'm going to
learn from it knowing I'm going to get
better H just makes that whole journey
one more practical in terms of what
you're learning from it but also uh
allows you to uh enjoy the process of
being a poker player rather than wishing
that you could uh retire with a pot of
money at the end of it so yeah those are
my main takeaways any that you wrote
down today Ry yeah I wanted to add to
that for people who want to get more out
of enjoyment out of it I think I touched
on Ryan holidays book up scores the way
remember I read that and then I was like
ah actually nothing bad can happen to me
anymore because you know it's kind of
like you either win or learn type of
mentality it's like oh cool another
obstacle cool I can develop in this way
like your your your mind completely
changed so I would if you struggle a lot
with like oh why do I keep on facing
these obstacles blah blah blah obstacles
way right in Holiday definitely good
read quick tip as well for gratitude I
think nowadays with apps and stuff you
probably have good things as well but I
used to have the five minute Journal I
don't know if you know about it Adam but
basically the five minute Journal I like
to have actually something physical you
can put for example next to the place
where you eat breakfast and there it
also wrote down like oh what are a
couple things that you're grateful for
very very very easy and it should be
easy because else it's hard to implement
I've experimented with this I made like
books of like 10 questions or something
that I ask myself every morning you do
it for two weeks and then you stop
that's it's
been in all honesty that's been usually
my experience how how these things go
and also I think if for the people
people are like yeah gratitude think
most people rationally agree with it's
probably a good idea the thing when you
write down gratitude like oh yeah I'm
definitely grateful for that it's very
important to also Fe it because feing
grateful is a skill that you can train
so how does feeling grateful actually
feel and I'm sure some listeners and to
my to a certain degree myself included
it's very hard to feel gratitude It's
actually an emotion that you have to
train so when you write down really try
to provoke emotions of gratitude okay so
often it's very easy yeah you should
feel this way you should feel that way
but if you don't experience if it's not
within your default State it's actually
emotions that you have to train which is
actually trainable so interesting uh
point for for the listeners in terms of
technical we talked a lot about
effective study habits he talked about
um that this was one of the most
important things that he likes to teach
your students he touch on a couple of
points one of them we talked about spot
frequency something that we talked on
before as well he also pointed out study
spots where people are more more likely
to screw up and then I asked him for the
characteristics he said yeah there's
usually more unfrequent situations or
situations where the way humans
construct their range naturally leads to
mistakes on a later street so these were
like some two ad two pieces of advice
that I wrote down we also talked about
how theory is a good foundation but you
should study Theory from a perspective
of trying to understand it and then ah
now I understand it how are people
likely to screw up and how can I take
advantage of that like he was clearly
yes he was very studied theoretically
because as we agreed right he talked
about building a house yeah you need you
need the foundation but after that you
can spend more time on other things and
trying to exploit people and that's in
the end uh where most of the money is
being made great conversation I want to
Jo thank sergy again for coming on and
uh sharing uh and sharing his wisdom I
