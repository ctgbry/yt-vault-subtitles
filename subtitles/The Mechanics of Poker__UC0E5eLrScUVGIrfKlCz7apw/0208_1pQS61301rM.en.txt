[00:00]
in this video I will show you guys how I
used ancient wisdom to win over 150k
winning at 9bb 100 while battling some
of the best in the game let's go in the
fifth century BC sunzu a Chinese
military strategist SL philosopher wrote

[00:16]
military strategist SL philosopher wrote
the book The Art of War in his book
sunzu reviews strategic principles and
tactics needed in order to win Wars and
is up and to today considered to be one
of the most influential works on
strategy and warfare when I was on my

[00:30]
strategy and warfare when I was on my
Pursuit trying to become the best I've
applied his tactics and they have helped
me battle my way through the ranks all
the way up to 5100 in this video I've
separed the three principles that have
had the biggest impact on this success
principle number one know yourself and

[00:47]
principle number one know yourself and
know your enemy or to quote sunzu if you
know the enemy and know yourself you
need not fear the result of a 100
Battles if you know yourself but not the
enemy for every victory G you will also

[01:00]
enemy for every victory G you will also
suffer a defeat if you know neither the
enemy nor yourself you will succumb in
every battle now this quote essentially
emphasizes on the importance of
self-awareness and knowing how your
opponents play know both and you will
win know only yourself and you will

[01:16]
win know only yourself and you will
sometimes take a loss no neither and you
have no chance of winning what I took as
actionable advice from this quote was
the following prepare like a boss and
know your competition which was my
background throughout this journey just
like you and every other poker player I

[01:31]
like you and every other poker player I
have leaks in my game and
inconsistencies in the way I perform in
order for me to evaluate if I'm winning
in a three to four-handed battle I need
to objectively look at my game and see
how my weaknesses and strengths line up
to those of my opponents does villain
strategy naturally play into my flaws

[01:46]
strategy naturally play into my flaws
are my biggest exploits neutralized by
the way he approaches the game next to
the opponents you have across from you
at the tables there's one more opponent
which might be the toughest one to beat
of all which is yourself sunzu says he
will win who knows when to fight and

[02:01]
will win who knows when to fight and
when not to fight am I in the right
condition to execute the strategy needed
in order to win in this lineup not only
right now at the beginning but also
re-evaluating 1 hour in are we still
profitable are we still in our aame or
are we showing signs that we've slipped

[02:16]
are we showing signs that we've slipped
in our C game in the way we play think
behave or feel and maybe it's just time
to take a break many players lose win
rate because they don't show up in the
right State of Mind are playing in
lineups that they're simply not beating
or are unable to recog that their

[02:30]
or are unable to recog that their
opponents are getting the better of them
or that they're playing very badly and
it's time to take a break sunu also
emphasizes on the importance of laying
plans sunu say the general who wins the
battle makes many calculations in his
Temple before the battle was fought or

[02:45]
Temple before the battle was fought or
more simply said every battle is W
before it's fought in many battles that
I've played the battle was already won
before the first card was even dealt as
next to having put myself in the right
state of mind I would go over a document
that I made for any regular that was at

[03:00]
that I made for any regular that was at
least occasionally battling in which I
outlined the five strategical
adjustments I was going to be making
against this player that would give me a
significant Edge would have the money
flow to me and basically guarantee that
I would be victorious in this battle
this is probably one of the most

[03:15]
this is probably one of the most
important things if you want to become
successful in battles which is to direct
every battle towards your game plan
instead of reacting to whatever your
opponent throws at you on the Fly never
can you be caught by surprise of
something that your opponent does every
Tri that he has in his Arsenal should

[03:31]
Tri that he has in his Arsenal should
have been anticipated analyzed
encountered beforehand for the last step
to Victory I would visualize the battle
I would see myself successfully
Implement my strategy feeling calm
confident and having everything under
control you can download the primer that

[03:46]
control you can download the primer that
I made using the link in the description
Down Below in which you will visualize
executing your game plan towards Victory
principle number two avoid what is
strong and strike at what is weak
military tactics are akin to water for

[04:02]
military tactics are akin to water for
water in its natural course runs away
from high places and hastens downwards
so in war the way is to avoid what is
strong and to strike at what is weak
much like water taking the line of least

[04:15]
much like water taking the line of least
resistance the way I came up with these
five strategical adjustments versus all
my opponents was by analyzing their
strengths and weaknesses exploring
someone's weaknesses from a technical
perspective is a topic commonly talked
about nowadays you compare someone's
stats to that of GTO the further he

[04:32]
stats to that of GTO the further he
deviates the bigger the leak and the
higher possibility for a plus if he
exploit something that's especially
important when analyzing your opponents
is to figure out how they are
constructing their ranges since they're
human it's impossible for them to
construct their ranges equal to GTO

[04:46]
construct their ranges equal to GTO
meaning that they will either be too
weak or too strong in certain lines and
to apply this principle on the tables we
will avoid the stronger range
constructions and we will strike at the
weaker range constructions however there
are more weakness to exploit I remember

[05:01]
are more weakness to exploit I remember
taking advantages of some guys who were
willing to start battles despite the
fact that they were already playing a
lot of tables simply because they did
not want to give up the lobbies or
players still willing to take on battles
despite them already being 6 hours into
their session and probably very tired or

[05:16]
their session and probably very tired or
even better stuck and tilted avoiding
someone's strengths completely sometimes
can be done but can be minimized sunu
say the clever combatant imposes his
will on the enemy but does not allow the

[05:30]
will on the enemy but does not allow the
enemy will to be imposed on him this
quote emphasizes on the importance of
maintaining control over the course of a
match let's say you play versus an
opponent who plays perfectly facing a
oneir cabat big blind versus button you
are the button in this hand and your

[05:45]
are the button in this hand and your
strategy is to often rain SE bat for a
one3 sizing your strategy plays into the
strengths of your opponent's strategy
and puts him in his comfort zone instead
what I would do in these scenarios is
try to eliminate one3 SE betting and
mainly play big bat check this way avoid

[06:02]
mainly play big bat check this way avoid
putting him in his strength and taking
him out of his comfort zone this same
philosophy can be applied to pre flop
let's say you play small blind on opened
and your opponent plays perfectly big
blind versus a small blind race however

[06:15]
blind versus a small blind race however
when we start limping we see that he
makes various mistakes we can now
neutralize his strength by never raising
and only limping the same can be said
for the race sizing that you decide to
use let's say you normally open for a
2.5x on the button but you see that your
opponent plays very poorly versus a MIM

[06:31]
opponent plays very poorly versus a MIM
race or poorly post slop in general and
you want to play a lot of pots with him
you might start raising more and for a
smaller sizing the same can be said the
other way around let's say your opponent
is very tough or he might over defend
versus the 3x you might open less and

[06:45]
versus the 3x you might open less and
for a bigger sizing simply set what
you're trying to do with your strategy
here is to have notes in which your
opponent is weak occur more frequently
to notes in which your opponent is
strong but what if your opponent has no
weaknesses well he might actually have

[07:00]
weaknesses well he might actually have
weaknesses however you're not skilled
enough yet to spot or exploit them which
brings me to another example of this
principle just because in order to be
the best you have to beat the best does
not mean you have to play against lonus
and Stefon at 40K andl straight away

[07:16]
and Stefon at 40K andl straight away
when I moved up to 510 and started to
focus more on battles I would analyze
all players that were willing to battle
and started ranking them best to worst
then what I would do is I would start
battling the guys who I identified were
weaker and avoid the guys who were were
clearly the bigger winners in these

[07:31]
clearly the bigger winners in these
games if I was playing a three-handed
game and one of the better regulars
would join the game four-handed I would
always sit out take a step back and
re-evaluate how this game will now play
versus who am I now playing in the most
common scenarios and am I still playing

[07:45]
common scenarios and am I still playing
within the weaknesses of my opponent if
I would think the flow of my EV was so
significantly disrupted maybe because
I'm now playing the most common
scenarios versus the stronger regular
instead of versus the weaker regular I
would put my ego on the side and simply
leave the game and come back tomorrow at

[08:01]
leave the game and come back tomorrow at
a later time by battling day in and day
out I started to become better at
spotting and exploiting my opponent's
weaknesses I was getting more confident
in my game and at some point there was
no one at that current stake that I
wasn't willing to battle which meant

[08:15]
wasn't willing to battle which meant
that it was time to move up and repeat
the process you do this until you reach
guys like lonus to which you apply the
principle again avoid what is strong I
remember at the top point of my battle
career I played against most opponents
lion is be big blind bets I soon

[08:31]
lion is be big blind bets I soon
concluded were simply out of my league
and would thus avoid but occasionally
there were some players following
different guidelines ignoring most
principles I've outlined in this video
and it usually did not end up well for
them only contributing to the ever

[08:46]
them only contributing to the ever
growing graph these guys had especially
three and four-handed principle number
three flexibility and
adaptability in six Max Games and
especially tighter range formations like
EP be MP it's much easier to hide your

[09:02]
EP be MP it's much easier to hide your
flaws as you don't play versus the same
opponent as often and in tight
formations strategies are usually less
mixed due to one clearly having a range
Advantage the way you make money in six
Max especially in bigger poos is by you

[09:15]
Max especially in bigger poos is by you
executing a solid strategy this strategy
is built on GTO principles and
deviations based on population
Tendencies and have your opponent can
you EV simply because they're playing a
weaker overall strategy than you in
three four-handed battle though there's
more room for exploitation as when

[09:32]
more room for exploitation as when
ranges get wider people's natural
tendencies get enhanced as they are no
longer protected by significant Equity
advantages battles unlike six Max is not
just about showing up and playing your
strategy it's about adapting versus The
Players your battling being elastic with

[09:47]
Players your battling being elastic with
your ranges and flexible in the
strategies you decide to deploy thinking
ahead of counter strategies your
opponent can Implement what the signs
are that they're countering your
strategy and what the counter to their
counter would be sunu says flexibility

[10:01]
counter would be sunu says flexibility
enables commanders to conceal their true
intentions mislead the opponent and
launch unexpected attacks by adapting
their approach and keeping the enemy
guessing they increase their chances of
achieving Victory you want to try and

[10:15]
achieving Victory you want to try and
throw people off their game by doing
things that they did not expect of you I
remember using unconventional raise and
three bet sizing to create an element of
doubt in my opponent's head as he's not
really sure what the ranges look like
next day I might create Confusion by
completely altering my strategy never

[10:31]
completely altering my strategy never
seab betting and only using over bets
for example or completely switching to a
range seabat strategy these are all
elements of mental Warfare as well sunu
says in the midst of chaos there's also
opportunity but how do we do in battles

[10:45]
opportunity but how do we do in battles
Bots fall short in their ability to
maximize versus human opponents as their
strategy is not specifically designed to
maximize their win rate versus their
opponent's Tendencies there was a
discussion a while back between saulo
Costa and George AKA um bro about how

[11:01]
Costa and George AKA um bro about how
hard a 500L player from sao's stable
would get destroyed in a high stakes
battle Sao made the argument that it
could never be much since he has puted
his students to war against the Bots and
they were only losing at minus 2bb 100

[11:15]
they were only losing at minus 2bb 100
buts unlike Stefan and lonus don't apply
sunu approved strategies of warfare your
weaknesses won't be pounded on your
strengths will not be disarmed next to
that there's various psychological
aspects of the game that are not being
taken in consideration how close to his

[11:32]
taken in consideration how close to his
technical ability is this 500 n player
able to execute when he's up against
very established Pros playing at the
highest Stakes there is a difference
between a but hero calling you and lonus
hero calling you when the but hero calls
you you know it's just part of an

[11:46]
you you know it's just part of an
equilibrium strategy and he's going to
call that hand some of the time with
lius though we don't know if he's
exploiting you because maybe
unconsciously in your strategy you're
over bluffing and Lin is is onto you the
same is true in a spot where you decide

[12:00]
same is true in a spot where you decide
to hear a call and lonus shows up with a
very thin value bet he might be on to
you and these kind of things can start
[ __ ] with your mind in the real world
doubt can start to creep in because what
were you doing here in the first place
it's 40K andl against Stefan and lus

[12:15]
it's 40K andl against Stefan and lus
while you're only a 500L regular next to
that when playing against a butt you
always know what to expect you can just
look at this game and this is the game
that you're going to face however you
might look at the stats and analyze the
games of Stefan and lius thinking that
you now know what to expect only to find

[12:32]
you now know what to expect only to find
out that they decided to implement a
different strategy versus you than what
their overall stats in their game plan
suggested or even better they might use
the fact that you know their Tendencies
against you by doing completely the

[12:45]
against you by doing completely the
opposite that my friends is the Art of
War if you like this video give it a
