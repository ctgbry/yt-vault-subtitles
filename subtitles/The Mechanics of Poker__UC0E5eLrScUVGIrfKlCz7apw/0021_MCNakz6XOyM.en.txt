[00:04]
yes yes yes yes welcome to
the stream
i already have a zoom table up

[00:17]
i already have a zoom table up
i wanted to actually to celebrate give a
shout out guys to the followers as you
can see follow count is 1k
which is a milestone i was actually
planning on playing some 1k but
there was no 1k yeah actually there is
one table 1k

[00:34]
where two dutch people are talking about
their girlfriend uh girlfriends
so yeah this was basically the only 510
table available

[00:45]
table available
uh you know i'm not gonna mess around
with these guys so back to the 500
zoom i'm in a more of a
actually more of a correct mood

[01:00]
he has seven news

[01:24]
yes

[01:39]
i think i'm bored in general quite
decent for us i'm just going to start
off with a
little wondered seabed

[01:57]
on a turn i think asus with my exact

[02:00]
on a turn i think asus with my exact
holdings
could check some of the time
but i actually have aces barrel

[02:16]
i think whole pot here is fine i think
even i had like queens or something
could probably still very bad for this
sizing
and we get like the prettiest run out

[02:34]
ever
so i think all we can do now is rip it
in
and hope we're not beat
we are not beat unless we get slow

[02:46]
we are not beat unless we get slow
rolled again just like a last shadow
what's your fight unlikely
slow rolling usually only happens in
between france
i would say
actually in hindsight he went quite big
three

[03:00]
three
but what was actually already a bit
bloated i think actually on the term
probably a one-third barrel would have
been fine
don't really have to split my range if
if you would have for example open min
i would have maybe gotten to 10 then on
turn splitting between like half pot
and one third would be fine but actually

[03:15]
and one third would be fine but actually
i think now i could have just
at one turret with range actually better

[03:32]
at one turret with range actually better
what to do here
can i go for it cause

[03:51]
gonna turn i mean he has a better hand
we're gonna go broke anyway
how shall we get the money

[04:08]
and now jamming the river and hope he
doesn't have a better hand
that seems like the strategy

[04:15]
that seems like the strategy
and my cam got frozen but we have a
solution to that
actually my cam wasn't even working so i
was actually already happy that
it managed to work at some point so

[04:31]
it managed to work at some point so
don't mind the little lag here
i remember watching you play nl 2k still
usually play
i mean i'm in the comeback streets been
focused mainly on coaching for the last
two years

[04:49]
which we are now making available
publicly
to the world and then basically slowly
i'm
starting to play again i play now uh
four hours a week
with all these guys here at the 500 l

[05:01]
with all these guys here at the 500 l
zoom pool
which has been a lot of fun as the level
often is very high
at least the same as 2k
but it's a bit of a cheaper warm-up i

[05:15]
but it's a bit of a cheaper warm-up i
would say
fives
gonna go for a c bet
a little trappy here with the ice king
lapanese

[05:32]
we are enjoying our lives sure race
actually just gonna throw a little right
a little raise here versus dennis
let's see what's dennis thinks about my
little race

[05:46]
little race
okay it just jams it in doesn't care ace
jack
okay gg dennis
all right mate was a good trap brief

[06:04]
love
oh we have two good hands yes poker is
being made very easy with all these

[06:16]
being made very easy with all these
hands that we're getting
let's see if we can get action on both
tables that would be nice
oh he just shifts it in

[06:32]
oh he just shifts it in
gg bucket kinks
[Music]

[06:45]
oh poker is such a fun game guys
poker is such a fun game
and it's being rewarded by just being
handed the money

[07:02]
handed the money
are being handed the money
king high board in general quite favor
do you use more a bet or range flop

[07:17]
do you use more a bet or range flop
strategy or a check
did that strategy more a check big bad
strategy i would say i'm not really a
big fan of range this range that
you get check race which is fine oh

[07:35]
he checks
we're blocking a set

[07:45]
we're blocking a set
probably do something with this hand
because

[08:03]
ever has the nuts flush right
race is a recreation
oh we ever slow play the nuts

[08:34]
basically the nut flush or at least in
theory is like the last hand you should
check on the turn so
from how i understand it and the other
table some
someone is trying to block me of my ace

[08:45]
someone is trying to block me of my ace
eight which is not gonna happen
actually now i would not prefer to have
a five but this is more a fact i just
don't think he has a lot of nut flushes

[09:01]
gg at least he thought about it for
quite some time right and at least we're
gonna snap off a little bluff here
thank you
that's so nasty a7 that's so nasty

[09:16]
that's so nasty a7 that's so nasty
what does it put me on now that is the
question
i think if and i had him as a i thought
it was a good target because i had him
as like a semi
something but then i really don't really

[09:32]
something but then i really don't really
know yet
what to make of that guy basically

[09:53]
and then actually let's first sweat this
one right

[10:00]
oh man fold age nine ace ten
boy because adam is like a semi
something we can also see that kind of
by his hand right

[10:17]
so he still thinks he's not like oh i
have a spade so i call
oh i think fluffers those type of
players
would probably work best
and they're referring to the pluribus

[10:32]
and they're referring to the pluribus
video on youtube
yeah that one or in general the pluribus
review is quite interesting
it indeed teaches you a lot about how
poker works and what he's trying to
achieve
and it also debusts like uh

[10:45]
and it also debusts like uh
i remember when we were doing uh doing
some seminars that
it kind of bust the
the misconception that gto is like this
boring
type of poker it's you will see guys

[11:02]
type of poker it's you will see guys
it completely isn't if you if you leave
it up to purpose
no it's not it's not it's not a couple
of german bots who are just sitting
there like this
i check i butt

[11:15]
i check i butt
and everything balance frequencies et
cetera et cetera now it doesn't really
work like that
i'm gonna give this guy some rope here

[11:36]
and basically we ain't going anywhere
even though an ace would not be a good
river

[11:54]
now we're definitely raising the river i
think
yeah yes yes

[12:01]
yeah yes yes
yes he has this beat then he has his
beat
but i think after him three betting

[12:16]
he has us beat gg
i mean i'm not saying it's a bad
strategy but uh
because basically on the flop you can

[12:32]
because basically on the flop you can
sort of do everything
you think you're really limiting
yourself though by only
hey

[12:46]
you're on the stream my friend
[Music]

[13:03]
nice to see you playing poker look
what's my money guys bitter easy
little easy what's my money
you missed that wacko money

[13:18]
you missed that wacko money
didn't you
i'm so happy for you

[13:47]
yeah a bit too easy likes to just grind
some 500 zoom to
i think just warm up his head
okay guys thank you all very much for
watching
gonna call it an end to the string

[14:23]
[Music]

[14:45]
[Music]

[15:03]
we had fun i think it was educational
as well we ran good don't think i
utilized on the rank on the wrong good
so don't think i played that well yeah i

[15:15]
so don't think i played that well yeah i
think there were quite a lot of hands
where
basically after afterwards i said okay i
should have done this should have done
that
but you know sometimes you have those
days like i also noticed my brain
doesn't really
didn't really think about the right
things

[15:31]
you have those kind of days important
to strengthen your
baseline knowledge i guess what you fall
back on for example take
take these streams right uh

[15:45]
take these streams right uh
these streams are basically my c game i
would say yeah
they're very much my sea game uh
this yeah so basically
what what i'm doing here this is like
the game that i fall back on when
i play basically at my worst uh

[16:02]
i play basically at my worst uh
which is good because it will give you
less swings right
basically from here i can only play b
game or a game and this is like the
worse it gets
and i'm quite happy about it so it's

[16:15]
and i'm quite happy about it so it's
very
basically when you when you strengthen
your theoretical knowledge your default
knowledge when you strengthen
like some general pool reads that you
can always fall back on
basically your worst game will become
less worse so basically in downswings as
well your win rate won't suffer that

[16:31]
well your win rate won't suffer that
much i think that's in general very
important
if you experience a lot of variety and
how well you play like big varieties and
maybe also accompanied with like some
pre some anxieties
it's probably because the gap between
your a gaming or c game is a bit

[16:46]
your a gaming or c game is a bit
big and i think strengthening your
theoretical knowledge is probably a good
idea
with that being said guys thank you very
much for watching and
see you all back monday

[17:00]
see you all back monday

social medias where we everything post a
lot of
good things um
