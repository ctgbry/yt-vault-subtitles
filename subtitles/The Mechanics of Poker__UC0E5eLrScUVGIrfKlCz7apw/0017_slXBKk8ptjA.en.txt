what's happening
why aren't
all right i think that we're working all
screens
yes yes yes yes yes you are
and we immediately get three bet
and here we raise it up with the nine
three
i'm gonna go for a little over bet here
on this board
i'm going to make a little cold for bed
here with the king queen suited
he calls interesting turn
not really sure what i'm gonna do here i
think i'm gonna barrel
don't want to get check raised but
i think if he has end like kingdom queen
10 he's in quite some trouble
and the river river is quite interesting
actually
you feel like with this end we have to
do something
but i'm not a very happy guy this could
be the one that flush who is going to
own me
should have waited also a little bit
longer for the ranger i'm considering
betting okay you default
back to me blocking me
all right man let's flop a set
he flopped
donkey donkey jared man let's go
now let's see the best 500 zoom player
in the world
last time i dunked the set against him
as well remember last stream king 10 7
with sevens
he folded he knows how to dodge bullets
that maybe makes him the
past 500 zoom player he races i'm very
tempted to just three but i'm
sure that just three bet yeah i'm gonna
go for it
pot left
how big is my three bet eighteen thirty
six
this is a good sizing ah he was just
messing with me
what do you think man jared meant did i
never have a set
okay let me get some green tea and
chocolate
gto hey guys we got the green tea
we got the doggy doggy this is my lucky
supporter
let's see if now now we are more lucky
now you're going to support us it's a
port to port port allen
[Music]
let's go let's
a little bit of a loose defense but you
know i know
why not why not got the green tea
checks back
now on the river we have to kind of
decide
i'm gonna go for the check call
okay check back so
all reads that you guys are making
don't know how accurate they're gonna be
you get three bet here with deep bucket
aces gotta sometimes slowplay this
actually
but not today let's go for it
a format
and he gets it in stack the best zoom
player
stacking the best zoom player
we did it guys if we would only stop
calling these [ __ ] knits that never
bluff
and just wait for aces against ace king
we would make a lot of money
now there we are seven deuce suited oh
yeah
pajamas
we got the seven do suited
and they fold ha 50 17 played 15
one i decided to go for the limp go here
with the espot
tula well i played some pots against
espatula in the past
[Music]
crazy
that's that's an interesting bet
that this has to be said is a very tough
hand i think is nine
going to be peeling as we sometimes turn
extra gutter
even though it's a very bad one
what is he saying that he has
i have no clue what's going on here guys
but yeah does feel like a call down
again let's hope for the best
jack 9 off suit are you [ __ ] kidding
me
mine are you [ __ ] kidding me
jack 9 off suit seriously you raise jack
9 off suit
over bet the flop and then make a
straight
yes yes yes espatula man that guy
too good can't beat him but i mean we
did have a nine so if he has jack night
off then our call
the gto call them with the ac9 and we
did have a nine so if you just check 9
off then our call
probably gto call them with the a7
where is uh my friend
obviously i didn't think he had jack
night off so
actually there are no losing players at
500 zoom true everyone is just crushing
man
everyone is just crushing everyone is
just crushing it
i call the tree bed here
just twenty percent of jack knight sorry
man
love it
i will i'll add it to the notes
90 of the time
the buzz
turn is close up yeah first this sizing
probably still
call
with a club
maybe i should also raise some of the
time actually i didn't even consider
that
why didn't i consider raising i'm
playing bad
playing bad should have considered
raising at least some of the time
could have considered raising some of
the time
meanwhile gypsy gypsy throws out a two
barrel here with
the on the jack 10 8
i think on a turn we have an easy call
again should we ever
race don't think so with a diamond
without a dominant diamond as it could
be
he checks
i'm chickening out and he has king nine
he also knows that my call button people
are giving buffs to me okay guys we're
going to change the strategy people
don't bluff me anymore
now we're going to just always fold
or am i leveling or am i leveling
got the pocket jacks
uh oh kind of a trouble flop
don't want to really don't want to
but i have to
