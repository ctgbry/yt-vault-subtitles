for free go over to our site and i'm
looking forward to seeing you in the
academy put your hands up put your hands
up put your hands up yo as we open up
the ace jack
this is a three bet easy call here we
good
also join on our table at 888 we got
aces first hand
so it's guaranteed action here at the
weka show
this is a plausible hand for a check
raise on the flop and at 87 it's quite a
high number we're probably gonna do that
turn is quite interesting i think
i think i think i think
so spot driver only gonna jam or check
i think jam with this hand is probably
correct play
we're going to start off strong and
aggressively here and he copy with queen
seven
with the queen
of hearts
okay
give it to me baby
give me [ __ ] what the [ __ ]
he saw two flush shows he was like
the guy the guy got queen ten of hearts
let's draw a little three bet here with
the jack three
where's mr helmets
he calls
interesting boards
not gonna sieve at this board
that often
actually you know it kind of depends
it's actually quite okay for me like i
don't have dudes and fights but i do
have ace deuce off h3 off
okay so ace for off some of the time
so that should
and obviously we have the access
advantage
but then again he has fours and threes
so it's it's interesting it's a two-tone
board so i wouldn't expect a super high
betting frequency but
also not that low medium
there's a check raise i think we just
have a call
where's the whole pod again i think we
just have a call
that's a
good
river
i said with with doubt
as deuces and fives
ace five suited obviously now have us
beat
but hey we shouldn't be too negative
here you can still also have made a
lower flush
so let's stay positive
or he just has ace queen
thank you very much sir
that again is much appreciated
all right
give it to me baby
so we are off on a flying start
a solid 6k stack
okay
people
people usually say that i should play
with the real money on but that tilts me
so hard so
i don't do it
i understand for stream branding etc etc
would probably be better but here we
three bet the ace queen decided to go
for a check on the floor
it's a check call
there's a barrel here facing a barrel
easy call as i said
river is quite interesting
i think we now have a check fold
let's say he did have i mean we're
blocking his main bluffs
which is is is a flush draw
so i think this is a spot where it's
very hard for him to be bluffing
it should probably show up with like
pocket fives
i would assume but then again are you
really gonna follow that true on that
river so
yeah having having the ace of diamonds
is just the worst card it's also it's
not really a spot where i know that a
lot of people like to give up flush
draws because you're blocking the
folding range but i think this is a spot
where if you have the nut flusher you
should just get it in as for example i
could have also had ace king of diamonds
maybe
in hindsight i think just the sea
betting flop is probably better see
someone saying results
unfortunately i don't know when i last
updated that
but unfortunately guys we went into a
little downer and i think we uh donated
away most of our winnings
or at least on the 5 10 10 20 tables
zoom zoom we confirm
now
have beaten and i'm not gonna go back
there because
you know
nothing left to proof i think we ended
like two and a half bb 100 i think
that's fine
this filter on the turn i think it's
quite close
let me go for call but don't hate check
raising
kinda pants the more aggressive you
think your opponent is the more we
should
check call
and vice versa
i'm gonna check raise the river though
here i made a funky line i checked the
board that normally you should not
really be checking
but we're playing versus recreational
i'm not sure if i should call he bets
will be quite big so i think i'm just
gonna
ship it
in but obviously he still could have
something random and if you jam you get
that out but
i got a time time time time time full
from blaker here
we had the best hand
we were allowed to put more money in the
pot right so he times faults interesting
so he probably had a draw
like ace jack or something that he now
thought was a bit too expensive heads up
ninth i guess
we can sometimes four bet
i'll go for the con
jack's bad flop
do a couple of things
i'm gonna go for the ten percent
here at ninth probably gonna fall to a
barrel i think having a nine is very bad
as office bluffs could be in the nine
region like queen nine check nine nine
eight
three turn
it's not a great term for my range
i think i'm gonna check
not because he can make threes but like
fives
uh let's say he had fives five is
an option
or like sevens
river is quite close
i'm going to check
and there's a better thing with this
even though everything is quite close
actually i followed way too fast with
jax i think jax with other club is a
fault i think this is a goal
this ace 10 i should probably sometimes
check race hey checks back interesting
turns probably a mix
i don't think he has much 5x he could
check back ace five of spades but that's
exactly the one that i'm blocking
i would say that this hand probably just
wants to bet
three quarters though
and queen do is just calling a flopping
two pair
seems like a solid strategy
i think just particularly with the ace
we can definitely bet a little bit
bigger
here
[Music]
i think raising is okay i think
all options are actually okay i'll go
for the race this time let's reroll a
high number
do you need help explaining what the
hell goes on in these videos well then
poker ambition is the place to go to
re-offer various servers for various
levels of players go over to our
sitepoker ambition.com to find out more
a screenshot is a call ace 8 seems to
easy check
aces kings a screen suited oh my god
hence every [ __ ] where
he checks
and sing people happen
people are approaching
some checks
i'm gonna roll very low i'm actually
gonna check as well
i actually like check back more for the
guys who i know start to be quite
aggressive in delay
but in general for example king queen i
prefer betting ace king f is queen i
think checking is fine
here with the kings i think batting
off
butt is my normal strategy
now i think here we can start throwing
out some delayed bats
let's start do that
the douche should not improve me at all
so from his perspective this can be a
little bit weird
kings i turn a king
i think
it's time slow play
and this is the easiest spot in the
world with jax
nothing here now
gonna fire
big and here i'm gonna go all in with
jax as i said this guy just joined don't
really know who he is
but he just had a premium hand
the kings i'm gonna call
that's an excellent river unless he has
pocketdates
but
that would just be completely [ __ ]
snapchat back interesting one hand
that's the turn as a snapchat king 10 of
hearts
for example i think this is a good
example
if you run if you just look at your own
individual this hand would not have been
in there right but this is yeah you're
you're clearly being very unlucky
personally i thought that jax versus the
unknown who squeezed his first head
that's also quite unlucky
but those things you don't see so
you have to come up with different ways
to estimate variants in this kind of
scenarios
which ways that i have found in ways
that i think is very
useful to add
to your strategy i'm a professional
world of warcraft player
okay never never played world of
warcraft
in general i have to say in the past i
used to be
a decent gamer
but
ever since i started to play online
poker i just stopped online gaming
because you're already spending so much
time behind your computer that my free
time i prefer to do something else
he's got the ace ten turn is going to be
interesting like i will have some ace 4
h5 suited here on the turn
i think if he barrels i would much
rather call dos
then ace 10. i also have a screen i have
maybe some 9x so
i don't think we have to go all that
wild i think having a 10 like i would
much rather bet h5 h4 now for sort of
the same reason so i'm gonna check this
one
river is
yeah you tell me what is the river
yeah so i wasn't 100 sure because i
could for example bet that river and he
could then raise
a certain like the hand that he had or
maybe had like king queen
not really sure
but it's very hard for me to show up
with
with bluffs there on that river
should probably bet though
this one is closed in terms of half
potting or three quarter ring
off potting my 130 i think i'm gonna go
for one pot
given the
semi-connectedness let's say it was jack
seven deuce i would have just bet one
third and then i'll leave it up to you
guys to figure out why i think
now banning half pot is a bit better
than on jack seven deuce
i'll leave that up to you
if everyone crushes who will lose
oh the guy who crashes the least of all
the crushes
if you were not streaming would you play
this game versus street top rack seems
quite dumb
so dumb
why do you do that
so
[ __ ] dunk you do it again i remember
in a video before i've told you to not
dunk why do you do that why do you do
that i did something funky guys
so dumb
it's something very funky so
we have aces and there's only 8bb in the
pod
i think he posted or lint
percent sure he posted the limb to be
honest
and he iso 3.5 actually decided to call
because sometimes you know you have
these these fish the first hand they
just go bananas so i figured you know
giving him opportunity to do something
funky was a good idea
now i'm trying to figure out what the
[ __ ] we do
honestly don't know
how much per month for the academy i
think it's 97 euros for one month
247 for three months
do check all this that i'm confirming
and you can also actually just
uh
join one webinar so you don't
necessarily have to be a member
i think that's 47.
all right
that's a what we call a good hand
those mechanics can teach german level
of players too yes i think so now if you
