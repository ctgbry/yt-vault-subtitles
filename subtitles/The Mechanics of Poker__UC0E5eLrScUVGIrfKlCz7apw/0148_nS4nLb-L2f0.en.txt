[00:01]
i'm gonna start off with a little donkey
donkey
you [ __ ] dunk you do it again i
remember in a video before i've told you
to not dunk why do you do that why do
you do that so dumb

[00:17]
you do that so dumb
[Music]
do you want the best of our proven cfp
program without the long-term commitment
then go over to the site

mechanics
hi there welcome back another playing

[00:31]
hi there welcome back another playing
explain gonna fire up two tables of zoom
who is looking uh quite tough so uh we
have to be a
on our a game today
oh actually a recreational just joint i
see

[00:45]
see
this guy was already here but this guy
seems to have joined
that's good news
but hey we should obviously still try to
be on our a-game today

[01:01]
actually yeah suddenly
the moment i pressed record i think two
or three recreations joined the pool
i guess they wanted to
uh they wanted to be here just for
youtube um
[Music]

[01:22]
this hand can kind of guide the way i
was thinking call
with the recreation over 30 bb
i guess you can make arguments for all

[01:30]
i guess you can make arguments for all
options and i think now just jamming is
the best play just make him fold king
queen

[01:53]
as we're going to check the king 10

[02:02]
definitely don't want to get check
raised
how many checks again i think
i'm just gonna give this one up

[02:17]
okay seven i'm gonna go into the call
here
and also through that
and i think
um

[02:30]
i'm gonna start off with a little donkey
donkey
and take it down

[02:49]
let me go for a check back here with the
jack queen good also
bad but
we will face some check raises

[03:00]
i would not be too happy about i think
now it's an okay spot to try out a bet
blocking is stronger holdings the jack 7

[03:16]
blocking is stronger holdings the jack 7
we draw to the bottom of the straight
i think our jack is very dominant
actually just gonna fold straight away
here without backwards i'm not really
sure
but i think that's actually a fine play
if you have the gutter on the higher end

[03:31]
if you have the gutter on the higher end
that would obviously be way better
now we river a heart
i think we should still bet

[03:49]
but it's close
especially i think
on the turn there people usually

[04:00]
on the turn there people usually
construct their range around a king or
equity and usually equity
means having a heart so then when the
heart completes people check back their
king
and they bet their heart i think it's
very hard for people to show up with a
lot of plus there

[04:23]
i slept here at asus
i think it's a spot where we should
straight away go for a big bat against
the recreational

[04:31]
the recreational
don't really see much value in betting
smaller
i think he's gonna respond quite
inelastic on that board so i think then
if you have a good hand
you size up and if you have a bad hand

[04:45]
you size up and if you have a bad hand
you should usually size down
an off-guard membranes with the
recreational rejected suited
going to go through that here with the
rocket king

[05:11]
with this text size i understand some
more cold calls from sancti

[05:15]
more cold calls from sancti
you don't really want to three bet
certain hands and then get shipped over
i think i'm just gonna take a small step
i think this has to work so unfrequent

[05:30]
i think this has to work so unfrequent
he has a bunch of high cards he has a
bunch of high cards yeah here you see he
has 109 off
he can also have the tenon off without a
diamond his range the impositions range
that called i think is going to often
contain suited hands as well so we have

[05:45]
contain suited hands as well so we have
completely missed
i think that bet is probably going to
make money
if they
they fold a hand that's not a flush and

[06:01]
they fold a hand that's not a flush and
if they call
and that is a flush
yeah our bet should be very effective

[06:16]
up to pair

[06:30]
i'm gonna go for a check race
i think the queen 10 i would always go
for a check race and 9 10 i might
sometimes play a little bit slower
i think the queen 9 somewhere in the
middle

[06:46]
it premiums back to back
no actually it's not back to back
simultaneously
that if that is the correct point one
fold uh you know you're gonna get quite
some faults if you have two aces

[07:02]
before that's in this positions
uh
it's close between ripping it in and
calling usually the suited version i
don't mind getting it in i'll do it 50
50 we rolled high

[07:15]
50 we rolled high
so
the offsuit one i would have just called
the offsuit ace king
i don't think we should be jamming there

[07:30]
i don't think we should be jamming there
in these positions
if there's a 3x
i think i'm just gonna fold
and pocket nines i think this is cut off
versus button i think it's your call

[07:46]
and
probably gonna do
same flop

[08:00]
don't think we ever want to be raising
nines here
you want to race a pair it's probably
going to be
a hand like pocket force
because if you have pocket fours and he
has let's say jack 9 suited you can deny
a little bit more equity

[08:17]
this is a very bad term for a range
and these are spots where
imposition
and just fire a lot and there's not
really much other position can do

[08:30]
really much other position can do
definitely don't try to defend correctly
here
um
having a diamond here kind of go both
ways usually when spr is deep
you don't want to have a diamond you
want to have the diamond and when sbr

[08:46]
want to have the diamond and when sbr
gets
smaller or when arranged get tighter you
don't really want to have the dime you
wait i'm gonna i'm gonna start this
story over i'm gonna fold this one
uh ninth in general like i said jack

[09:00]
uh ninth in general like i said jack
knight suited here sevens for example
would be a better car call than knights
because he will basically have more
bluffs um
to come back to my uh
great ramble
i think here with this king i'm gonna
treat that small

[09:16]
treat that small
under the model of give the recreational
option
maybe it does something uh does
something stupid
but going back to what i was saying
about the diamond
let's say for example you play a
stingray spot big man versus button

[09:32]
stingray spot big man versus button
or button first big blind you usually
want to have the diamond in continuing
okay
but let's say for example you play a
three web pod where ranges are tighter
where he has less bluffs then if you
have a diamond you're blocking more
bluffs

[09:48]
so that's usually kind of the guideline
that i that i go with
um in single way spots deeper stacks
wider positions
i continue with the diamond in three bad
bots four by pots where

[10:03]
having the diamond will reduce some of
his bluffs i usually go without the
diamond this is not uh
okay you can now go to the solver
sometimes he turns it around

[10:15]
but yeah this is this is
how i concluded
how i'm going to approach that but
but yeah like i said it's very important
there on the turn to not try to defend
correctly because
you just simply can't due to the

[10:31]
you just simply can't due to the
amount of equity the imposition range
has
if you have a pair so let's say we had
h3 suited or something i guess we could
have had that hand
right it was
blues3 yeah h3 suited for example that's
always a call

[10:46]
always a call
sixes i would say now is always a call
especially because he bet at half pot
but sevens i would say is your previous
call because you're not blocking the ace
five the five six the jack nine
the eight nine

[11:01]
a little donkey donkey quite a good
board to me
a street an h35 board is actually
important
i'm going to do quite some checking on

[11:18]
and here i'm going to split the turn
actually i don't mind this hand in an
over bet
let's say he has king eight or something
i don't mind if that now just falls a

[11:31]
i don't mind if that now just falls a
turn then if we refer to six our
straight is
more often good
and i'm going to continue checking here
with the h3
i think that is a fine play

[11:46]
html percent sure

[12:18]
not 100 sure about the turn
when that queen hits
if the turn is a nine or something i do
like checking again
on the queen

[12:30]
on the queen
you could make an argument for
betting
because he will have hands like king
jack king 10
that are going to probably check behind
and that would call a bet so always when
you're

[12:45]
you're
slow playing
you have to take into consideration how
many hands you're losing value from
which usually means a hand that calls
your bet but doesn't bat when checked

[13:23]
i'm gonna bet this sometimes check this
sometimes went for the bet this time
if i'm gonna check back
a draw it's probably gonna be the king

[13:33]
a draw it's probably gonna be the king
queen

[13:46]
a river is close
i think this one i'm gonna bluff

[14:09]
blocking the ajax to the day screen
suited we don't have
spades
i think if you had ace king would just

[14:15]
i think if you had ace king would just
check rip the turn
so he probably is going to have
a low ace axe maybe a king 10 suited
type of holding
maybe a flush draw

[14:30]
and it's like a7 suited or something
i'm just going to call her with the
queen jack suited with the guy having 36
big blinds i don't want to three bet and
him
ripping it in my face

[15:00]
do we check and go for the random factor
or do we bet for value against eights i
check and go for the random vector
the random factor was indeed correct he
had deuce tendu suited but that is a
bear

[15:16]
bear
but yeah probably has a lot quite a lot
of random hands in his range but then i
think checking is
it's better here actually i would have
probably dunked if
xiao say so wouldn't have dunked

[15:31]
still
feel like the pot is being stolen away
from me
i think with the recreational there i

[15:45]
i think with the recreational there i
think there's definitely some hands that
we should be dunking three-way
on a low
especially when the board gets more
connected i think we do more dunking but

[16:01]
connected i think we do more dunking but
on this board i think it's still fine to
implement some dunks
bucket force got the first big client
pocket files both i would say frequency

[16:17]
pocket files both i would say frequency
false faults
this one we will call this one we will
call as well okay
actually just gonna fold straight away

[16:31]
actually just gonna fold straight away
with pocket fives
we're not blocking the h5 suited
there's just not much we can do so these
are just two boards where i think the
the three better just connect so well
that we are forced to do some

[16:46]
that we are forced to do some
overfolding on the flop
this hand we could forward some time
this time

[17:02]
another donkey
king 10 i wouldn't have dunked but with
the nine on a seven and an eight you
know we turned some gutter so
i think dunk betting hands that have a
nine probably going to be fine twos for
three very good boards for the big blind

[17:15]
three very good boards for the big blind
collar
now and in the future
so i checked
king nine we didn't really improve much
we
have nothing going on for us so i think

[17:32]
is good
and on the river
very tempted to bluff this one but i'm
not going to let's say we had end like 9
10. i think that's a fine bluff i think
you don't want to have a king yes we do
have a club but

[17:47]
have a club but
something
i think the king is
the bigger problem
here with ace king i decided to check
all the turn
s37

[18:05]
it's the easy spot to over bluff there
on the river after the dunk bet
especially considering that the car the
car that now completed the straight
the straight out we would have most

[18:16]
the straight out we would have most
likely barreled more often
so it's very easy there to uh
over bluff i think on the river
if you're not careful
so then especially king heisei

[18:36]
not even going to try this actually it
could be again a dunk spot let's just
let's just keep on dunking
after this time we are against a
recreational again we didn't improve we

[18:45]
recreational again we didn't improve we
don't have a heart let's say we had a
hard to go with his hands i don't mind
uh
a little barrel but i'm just gonna give
this one up
let's give the donk a dunk of uh own

[19:01]
let's give the donk a dunk of uh own
dough as we say in the netherlands
actually we say biscuit of own dough
which means
that you do something that he usually

[19:15]
that you do something that he usually
does
ace eight we could sometimes do a little
bit of everything let's try a little
through better

[19:34]
don't hate me i 89 shout out to mrs
don't hate me 89
wow
don't hate me 889
don't you just hate

[19:45]
don't you just hate
the 69
she plays the 200 swim pool
what can the others do she's beautiful
and clever
and what can we ever do to endeavor you
ah i know

[20:00]
ah i know
look up the 200 zoom pool
thanks for the raid don't hate me 89
and long live
the six nine

[20:27]
do various things here with the ac8

[20:32]
i decided to check back this i will open
some of the time
i'm going to call it turn
interesting river

[20:45]
the feeling he made something
and now he checks
we may try to bluff him
let's try that
ah that was a very bad idea weko

[21:01]
ah that was a very bad idea weko
he did indeed made something but he
wasn't planning on folding it
yeah not really sure though
not really sure i don't mind the check

[21:15]
not really sure i don't mind the check
back versus a recreation basically
versus a versus um
versus a fellow pro
i would just
see that high frequency because i think
in check back they're not gonna do too
much funky [ __ ] and a recreational

[21:30]
much funky [ __ ] and a recreational
when you give him option
he usually does some funky [ __ ]
so
that's why i think the eevee is checking
back especially the spades i like
because you don't mind you mind it a
little bit less that certain hands
realize let's say as jack six spades

[21:47]
low frequency but
we both turn a spade that's quite nice
so i think checking back with the
intention of not folding is fine if you
check back with the intention of folding
i think you should just bet

[22:03]
if you check back
and then spew off
money when the flush comes in maybe you
should also just consider seat belting
the flop okay tip to self
here with the queen nine i just decided

[22:16]
here with the queen nine i just decided
to see that i think you know i will have
quite a lot of offset broadway's in my
range and his cold call on the small
band will
be quite pocket pear heavy i would say
that's fine i'm just going to start off
with a c bet as well with the k9 and go
from there

[22:31]
from there
return an open ender
[Music]
there's various things that we can do
here i'm gonna go for the bat

[22:46]
here i'm gonna go for the bat
obviously we don't really want to get
raised
but i was intending to barrel
bricks
that's really a brick
problem is though we still sometimes

[23:00]
problem is though we still sometimes
lose resent like king queen or ice queen
i feel like we still have to bet
something
i'm not very happy about it
yeah

[23:15]
yeah
he made it
so
on the
turn we have an open ender
the downside of betting is he races
that's pretty [ __ ]
but i do think it's a good triple barrel
opportunity versus recreationals who are

[23:31]
opportunity versus recreationals who are
in general a bit looser like i said he
still has some hands that are even on
this river that are just going to fold
mainly king queen ace queen
maybe even the same same type of hand
it goes a bit deep bigger so i'll fold

[23:45]
it goes a bit deep bigger so i'll fold
this a bit more
often um
i think there is a good opportunity a
good chance that on the river
for example now is a flush right i think
there's a good chance on the river that

[24:00]
there's a good chance on the river that
if he has a flush or 10 on the river
that he actually dunks it out
all that being said i think it's
i think it's still a fine bluff on the

[24:15]
i think it's still a fine bluff on the
river just trying to force him to fold
air i went for a half bot sizing which
is very transparent
so we actually get a lead here on the
board

[24:30]
that i think i'm just gonna raise
don't have a spade so in this case i
don't want to have a spade because i
would
miss someone to get value from like king
queen space king jack of spades

[24:46]
queen space king jack of spades
i think elite support depending how many
pairs he opens and calls but i don't
think he should be leading the sport
because he's gonna have all of the
sevens the eights he's not gonna have
deuces that often he's not gonna have
threes that often he's not gonna force

[25:00]
threes that often he's not gonna force
that often and the deuce six four
yeah i already said it the paris that he
probably doesn't always open and doesn't
always call the tribe with improve
i think that's just uh
a bad dunk

[25:15]
a bad dunk
this on however is a good dunk or at
least a good spot to dunk let's keep it
that way
he raises
we're going to go
let's say we had 10 6
or
96 or at least something that could

[25:32]
96 or at least something that could
improve in the future i don't mind three
betting
and this is a very good card for us so
we should be
dunking i think

[25:50]
we're going to do with this with a very
i would almost say range
and the river is the spade

[26:00]
and the river is the spade
not great i do still think our hand is
worth a decent sized bet
not too big though i think three
quarters is fine

[26:20]
and pray to god he doesn't raise
if he raises though what are his i mean
his values made it then gonna be the
eight excess spades

[26:32]
let me see what he got
as a lot of the higher flush
draws so let's say it's ace jack space
or something it's not really going to
raise me on the flop we have top set

[26:46]
bucket
so yeah on that six six four dues board
i think he just has a worse overpair
very often so yeah they only have kinks

[27:00]
very often so yeah they only have kinks
you should try to get some money in it's
my advice to the people
no reason in calling
literally the only hand to benefit in
calling from could be a hand like king
jack suited that donkey flop but it's so

[27:16]
yeah so unfrequent
for example
on the board that i dunked with the jack
six the eight
five four i'm not mistaking
you should never race kings or aces
because i can dunk

[27:30]
because i can dunk
jack then off suit knight then osu
but if your opponent's range contains a
lot of worst pairs
usually the time to get value
is then

[27:53]
i now let the one turn but actually i
think
with the with the jack six i think we
could have even let bigger

[28:00]
could have even let bigger
we can check that afterwards but i think
i think we should leave bigger
and here i think i'm going to
draw a little check crazy

[28:20]
inching there
going to draw the little block

[28:47]
or at least
probably a mix the thing is when the
straight completes with the jack six we
probably also want the lead quite a lot
for protection
so then a mix between some maybe even

[29:01]
so then a mix between some maybe even
smaller sizings and bigger sizings
maybe like a ten percent lead mixed with
a bigger lead twenty percent mixed with
a bigger lead something like that would
probably be a interesting range
construction and how do you come to the
conclusion that that could be an

[29:16]
conclusion that that could be an
interesting range construction weka well
you think about what kind of hands you
have in your range
and what they are trying to achieve
right
let's say i'm only betting for
protection
let's have ace eight and i'm just
betting for protection versus random

[29:31]
betting for protection versus random
over cards and chops
then probably i just wanna bet one big
blind
right
however i do also have some straights
and i do have some good hands to bluff
with like the eight nine the open ender

[29:45]
with like the eight nine the open ender
that hand can then go in bigger sizings
then you have like some hands that block
a lot of the calling range so let's say
two pair especially the ones with the
eight
that we could then
uh add for example to our smaller bet i

[30:00]
uh add for example to our smaller bet i
think after the race after we got the
race we don't really have a check
i think we just have a dunk
so then i think we have to give
ourselves more more sizings

[30:20]
and already the theme of this video guys
gonna be dunking
pretty sure
so dumb
that's why you play this baby money

[30:30]
that's why you play this baby money
limit
i'm gonna do my best
whenever more spots come up even though
they're not really spots but hey
you
play poker with pink don't glad don't
pet glasses on it could be a spot

[31:06]
survives you're a bit deeper
12 and a half

[31:16]
i think five seconds just beer call
deuces trees fours i'll probably still
do with a certain frequency
i don't mind throwing out a little raise
on this board he bets off

[31:34]
don't mind freezing this
very low frequency though

[32:07]
i was going to say he checks but it's
she checks
i think i'm just going to call for his
4db for the same reasons i
talked about earlier you don't really

[32:16]
talked about earlier you don't really
want to get jammed
i'm not going to barrel the fives
especially let's add six seven i don't
mind bearing six seven
i think we still have a caller with the
king 10 i see it back to royal flush
draw so

[32:30]
draw so
i mean
the board doesn't run out very good for
me
i don't think there's much i can do here

[32:47]
ace king for example was a hand that i
was still ahead against
no longer
and she goes for a small bet i think
it's fine i think she could even go
smaller
i think there's probably some hands here

[33:00]
i think there's probably some hands here
in your range that you want about 10
with

[33:34]
not really sure if my line was a thing
at all probably a thing at a
very low frequency
here
we don't have a kicker if i had a kicker

[33:45]
we don't have a kicker if i had a kicker
on my bed
well that's good that you didn't have a
kicker wacko because you lost some money
by four also a hand that i could
sometimes raise
and you know
we're recording a video so
why not

[34:12]
like i would say the best
suit combo to have would be 5 4 with a

[34:16]
suit combo to have would be 5 4 with a
spade
you definitely want to block the two
pairs the queen five suited to jack five
suited i think that's definitely
relevant
obviously you would now for example if i
now add a spade i could barrel
but i don't have a spade so i'm not

[34:30]
but i don't have a spade so i'm not
going to barrel
both are bluff racing the flop got a run
out that's very much not in our favor
i think
we should probably bet this now here on
the river

[34:59]
i'm just gonna

[35:02]
i'm just gonna
if he would have checked it would have
probably better think king queen is a
hand that i would usually play that way
and i think we have
very little to no shot on value

[35:45]
and let's say we would have raised force
with this then i would obviously only do
it with a spade so and again
on the spade i think we're going to have
quite some nice barrels
a call

[36:01]
a board that could be done some of the
time
it's not as good as a low board
like i said the pocket pairs in our
range are
uh
are gonna make up for quite a big

[36:15]
are gonna make up for quite a big
proportion of a range the other part
that makes up for quite a big proportion
of the range are the
suit hands which i would mainly say is
acetone off king jack off that you would
call there so then a 10 jack flop is
yeah look quite decent i decided to call

[36:30]
yeah look quite decent i decided to call
her because there's quite a
quite a big recreational here in the
small blind but this
is a bit loose don't try this at home
kids
i say the recreation was in the big

[36:45]
i say the recreation was in the big
blind i think it's a fine car i think
smallmouth is pushing it and that's
mainly
uh because we are going to fold
versus re-raises
and
when the recreational is in the small
blind he's going to call often but then

[37:00]
blind he's going to call often but then
you get a good squeeze spot for maloyd
so therefore you want to call more when
he's in the big blind obviously also in
the big blind is going to call more
that's obviously also something to take
in consideration
here with the ace eight

[37:18]
we're gonna try the barrel
i think
we still sometimes we know the river
versus hand like king nine a speaking
out of hearts king ten off suit

[37:31]
out of hearts king ten off suit
maybe even four or five
and we can barrel a nine 10 a hard king
that's maybe why i did what i did here
in the turn i'm actually going to draw a

[37:46]
in the turn i'm actually going to draw a
little betsky
i'm going to split there on the turn
the phase erase

[38:07]
do you want to make
2022 your greatest poker year ever
now i've done a webinar on how to do

[38:16]
now i've done a webinar on how to do
that in our academy which we have made
available completely for free so go over
to pokerambition.com
and let me help you achieve your goals
what was the head i was talking about

[38:31]
what was the head i was talking about
i was talking about the a8 yeah that
makes oh both ac8 the a6 suited the
spades and the other is eight
also the downside of checking with ace 8
on the turn is that he would sometimes
now bluff you on the river and we're not
going to call right

[38:46]
going to call right
that is obviously always a problem let's
say yes he had indeed let's say he
indeed had the kingdom off
and we check and he blocks the river and
we're going to fault
that's gonna cost you ev so then i

[39:00]
that's gonna cost you ev so then i
prefer to use a strategy also that
doesn't get bluffed
is there are smaller sizing i think i'm
going to call five some of the time

[39:16]
going to call five some of the time
i don't really know what this guy is in
the big blind
demo
that like that i don't know x kind of
extra incentivizes me to call
and i'm going to try a little donkey

[39:31]
and i'm going to try a little donkey
donkey donkey
keep the theme of the video
and

[39:45]
and
take a stand over there
and i hope the river is not a heart

[40:01]
just blank the river just put a deuce
out there dealer do the clubs
ooh that is also interesting
is

[40:37]
i think an ace
incentivizes me more to jam
as he will have

[40:46]
as he will have
some ace x
of hearts
obviously you know i was considering
also betting a bit smaller because
i was thinking maybe lower over pairs
but i think those would raise
flop

[41:00]
flop
some of the time maybe except for maybe
kings
okay so another reason why you don't wet

[41:17]
okay so another reason why you don't wet
flops when you're out of position
is to deny the option
for your opponent to pot control

[41:31]
to take a good example let's say you
race from
under the gun
the flop comes and the big blind calls
you and the flop is four five six you
recognize that board as being quite good
right or three four five i think four
five six is a good example you have some

[41:46]
five six is a good example you have some
sets that you don't have
he has suited connectors that you don't
have
so what you're going to do as in
position
uh
you're most likely going to
do quite some pot controlling right and

[42:00]
do quite some pot controlling right and
the dunk denies the option for the
imposition player to both control so you
can start dunking
and even use bigger sizings
on the flop straight away i would say
that that's definitely an option the
reason why we bet small is because we're
not only wanting to bad

[42:16]
not only wanting to bad
sets we want to for example on the four
five nine i might also want to better
end up pocket six
if is a big bet straight away on the
flop i think our hand is a great
candidate for a call
not only because we have the ace but we
also have the twos to go with it which

[42:30]
also have the twos to go with it which
unblocks basically all of his bluffs
actually it's not completely true here
with the pocket deuces
river i think we have to bet that's one
next question is how big

[42:56]
great
record the queen 10.

[43:13]
probably calling again but having a 10

[43:15]
probably calling again but having a 10
is not great
i think a spade is not great
a lot of things are not great but i
think i still have a mandatory call
given the fact that we have a lot of his
highs on the paris
could still be burying

[43:30]
could still be burying
the queen himself
the river though it's gonna be a bit
dicey
actually he probably does like jack then
box actually my main
faults
so he probably wants to give object 10

[43:52]
is he going to give him
then again so i have a little bit of a
conflict here about uh

[44:00]
conflict here about uh
how gto would play the spot
range construction rise and how
i perceive
humans constructor range
and then mainly in terms of the 10

[44:17]
sucks
we said i think i'm just gonna call the

[44:30]
we said i think i'm just gonna call the
the queen without the 10 i think that
works better in practice
in theory i'm not sure i
think in
i'm not sure

[44:45]
i would say in theory that jack tent
this
doesn't bat bad
all that often
so then having queen then could actually
be good again

[45:02]
actually we have not thrown out the
seven dudes for a long time so let's uh
let's start a little seven dudes for the
fans
very good port for me

[45:21]
depending on the run-out i can see this
go all the way
far so good

[45:48]
not a great river
oh that's not a good river

[46:04]
well i mean we have 7i
i just show them drunken style and i
think it's good for poker like bring
some fun enjoyment

[46:15]
so we're going to still go in and he
falls okay
oh my god
am i the best
10 admit it said say it you have to say
it
i mean he's still going to go
always ace queens

[46:30]
always ace queens
and the river you should probably call
like some ace queens with a heart
bucket sevens with a heart
because seven eight made a straight i
would say pocket sevens with a heart is
probably also a fine candidate
so we do block some hands that call with

[46:46]
so we do block some hands that call with
the seven believe it or not it's not
it's not as bad as it seemed
but yeah mainly just trying to fold ace
queen here with the five six on the
other table he opened small i decided to

[47:01]
other table he opened small i decided to
draw a little call with the 56 suited
i think i'm just going to bet
one big bite

[47:23]
they already see what checking in juices
so then we have to bat
then i'm gonna try to find a sizing

[47:32]
hey raises he's saying that he has king
jack with the king of diamonds kings
with king and diamonds which are off
ballot
bluffs

[47:47]
of
love
all right the bluffs

[48:15]
then come from king jack i guess
all right king jack

[48:34]
not sure
unfortunate a fortunate river

[48:49]
actually i don't mind just checking h10
can we make a very funky float here with
the five twos
yeah why not
okay

[49:00]
okay
this may be pushing it but
like what you usually see on a sideboard
says on the the back backdoor gutters
sometimes come into play

[49:15]
i mean if you then decide to flow that i
think actually this is a fine candidate
uh i'm gonna bet the turn
just hope you

[49:30]
a head that's better than me okay and
the flow turned out great great play
echo
here with the a7 i just decided to check
it down and we win at showdown

[49:49]
i know i said i was gonna
grab on every possible sort of donkey
dunk spot i decided not to do it that
time
but obviously

[50:01]
but obviously
although i'll lower the price like how
low are the pairs the three and the four
okay
i we could definitely have some dunks
there on that board
i don't mind not to do it with

[50:15]
i don't mind not to do it with
a stem

[50:36]
i'm going to check back the as9
and again i think i've said this before
it's a recreational then you'll usually
see me checking back a bit more with

[50:45]
see me checking back a bit more with
medium strength hands
and letting them do something funky
come on
show the viewers why i do it mr xiao say
you
checks the river

[51:06]
just betting back is probably good
it's considering a small bet the benefit
of the small bet is obviously that you

[51:15]
of the small bet is obviously that you
get
called more often
but also that you can sometimes
you're gonna hear me say it again do
something funky

[51:35]
checked and suited okay first volume x
is very small
yeah and i'm gonna stop right there
i think just that argument alone makes

[51:45]
i think just that argument alone makes
this a call
h34
i'm going to cover these and suited with
rocco
started to hook over here in the small
blind
check the flop

[52:01]
there's a little 10
which i can appreciate
um

[52:16]
a lot of events i would love to check
race but i don't really feel like this
is one of them
so rocco uh decides to donk bet
i just had to call the race i was really
sure if that's the right play come over

[52:31]
sure if that's the right play come over
the top but hey have a flash draw

[52:50]
okay got the
we got owned here by the pocket aces
i think here we're getting drawn in
yes we're getting drawn in
diamond

[53:07]
so with the jack
jack then
i think
blocking the ace uh the ajax offsuit

[53:15]
blocking the ace uh the ajax offsuit
there is quite important
we're not blocking a head like king
queen off which is also quite important
in general i expect him to barrel
diamonds
so
i think
our hand there is a is a fine jam

[53:32]
our hand there is a is a fine jam
like i said i could i consider the flop
check race which we could also do
but i liked calling a little bit more
yeah he played this hand well i would

[53:45]
yeah he played this hand well i would
have checked the flop most probably if
i'm him but if he just range bets that
hand then i think checking turn is
definitely the correct play
shout out to him for the slow play

[54:11]
bucket tents
there's a nine and a seven

[54:20]
actually gonna size this one down this
import that you usually bet
round half bottom but i think this hand
generates more v as a smaller bet or a
check

[54:44]
i think in this position i'm going to

[54:45]
i think in this position i'm going to
check the turn

[55:02]
expect bad
tomorrow i don't really know where this
guy is
interesting river

[55:39]
i'm gonna try a little donkey donkey to
stay in the theme of the video

[55:48]
obviously calling the race
okay interesting
he has the queen of clubs

[56:00]
he has the queen of clubs
so
maybe i got that spot wrong there i'm
not really sure
but what i was thinking is when the
10 of clubs rolls off
but maybe i'm just way too aware here
of how my range is going to look

[56:17]
of how my range is going to look
the nine is not a club the seven is not
a club
so i actually expected
in position
to do some pot controlling mainly with a
head like jacks possibly queens

[56:35]
and actually i wanted to prevent him
from pot controlling by betting 10
also if he would have revered jack then

[56:45]
also if he would have revered jack then
which is very unlikely of course
but let's see let's see let's see
i mean he still he jammed him with
queens
obviously if he's still jamming it in

[57:01]
obviously if he's still jamming it in
with queens with a club
then i think my play is great because
obviously again
and i think we talked about this before
i think it was uh
playing the h3
that

[57:15]
that
if we check and he just jams queens
whereas if we bet 10 percent and he just
calls queens that's obviously very
costly
but if versus the ten percent he's going
to play queens with a club the same

[57:30]
to play queens with a club the same
let's say he let's say he plays and this
is quite often right you will see us in
a solver
the difference between
how imposition plays facing a check and
facing a bet is not facing a ten percent
path or a check it's not gonna

[57:47]
path or a check it's not gonna
be so different
however there are some hands like i said
that are probably going to check let's
say you did have the ace 9 suited
let's say did river the 10 jack

[58:01]
those ends are going to
check behind
and let's see if we check and he doesn't
have queens with a club maybe he's
checked it behind and if we check he
jams screens with a club

[58:17]
jams screens with a club
and versus ten percent he does the same
only now he calls
ten percent instead of check behind so
we gain some more value
but hey let's uh let's look at it up in
the solver i'm also gonna
with the session and then we'll review

[58:30]
with the session and then we'll review
some hands
oh i lay out here with the king jack
i think we're forced to call the river

[58:45]
not very happy about it
but night then off missing i think
should give him quite some combos but
does feel like king queen quite often
he just went completely yolo with queen

[59:00]
he just went completely yolo with queen
tanoff
throw everything what i just said in the
trash ladies and gents
the guy just saw the 88 board and he was
like you don't have an 8 buddy

[59:21]
but i considered that maybe an eight
choose some
bigger size but hey yeah
okay now that's too much too much too

[59:32]
okay now that's too much too much too
much
interesting session interesting session

[59:54]
versus a recreational again i think it's
a spot where you should just start
sizing big

[1:00:01]
sizing big
raises i think this is just
always going to be a mate hand
so we're going to get it
a made hand or a hand that is going with
it so let's see his ace jack or
something i think he's just going to go

[1:00:15]
something i think he's just going to go
with it so i think we have very little
to no full deck here
which is good because we have two pair
but we are behind
and he won one which is not fair
but two i would say i would personally
say i could be biased here but i would

[1:00:31]
say i could be biased here but i would
personally say that winning two is not
fair if we're almost 50 50. then you
should win one and i should build one
but hey
life ain't fair guys life ain't fair
and some people they ate only grass they
they eat very well their whole life and

[1:00:45]
they eat very well their whole life and
they get hit by a bus and there's also
people who smoke for five decades and
they make it to 90 right but that's not
an excuse to say well i'm not just gonna
smoke because i may outlive a healthy
person no
because now you're basically saying i'm
gambling with my life

[1:01:00]
gambling with my life
and the odds of me
experiencing a positive outcome are
lower right so you should always try and
improve your odds
but even if your odds are great that
doesn't mean you're hold right so as i
said you can die young you can live long
life or here you can play around
perfectly but it doesn't mean you always

[1:01:15]
perfectly but it doesn't mean you always
win so all you can do is just focus on
putting in your best possible effort
all right let's evaluate some hands that
we played starting off with the pocket
tents in three bets we saw the flop of
seven three nine
see that is one third i remember saying

[1:01:30]
see that is one third i remember saying
we're gonna use some bigger sizings here
you can see that the three quarters and
half pot are the most dominant sizings
however tense
specifically tense
uh prefers usually to check
and
if it bats you see there's also some one

[1:01:46]
if it bats you see there's also some one
third betting it still actually prefers
the bigger sizings but mainly check aka
a bit more careful line
so we nailed that one turn is a deuce
again i think dense should be played
very passively indeed block or check we

[1:02:02]
very passively indeed block or check we
went to check imposition our bets
big i made imposition bad half pop
because the sizing scheme here was a bit
a bit bigger i think
uh
so he bats half but then we actually on

[1:02:15]
so he bats half but then we actually on
the turn versus like i said i didn't
really know this guy was
but exactly 10 of spades 10 of diamonds
already folding so we're already in
quite close territory but we did decide
to call and then the river came to ten
of clubs and we decided to try a little

[1:02:31]
of clubs and we decided to try a little
donkey donkey
the question is if that was indeed the
correct play so we call
and in the river we do indeed see donks
however i see a one-third dunk here
pocket knights is quite a dominant donk
and 109 suited i in my head then i'm

[1:02:46]
and 109 suited i in my head then i'm
suited and
tense was kind of the same
actually i would probably prefer tense
however it pure checks tense okay so
let's see what happens if we check

[1:03:00]
let's see what happens if we check
imposition indeed is going to check back
queens and jacks very often this was
something that i had top of mind jack 10
suited king 10 suited ace and suited
jacks queens all hands that are going to
check behind whereas if we bet 10
percent they are going to call okay

[1:03:15]
percent they are going to call okay
that's beneficial you say okay miss
value from bluffs but or at least
in
silverland if we check he bloss for
example these holdings if we bet 10 he's
still bluffing those so you usually
don't really lose much value from bluffs

[1:03:30]
don't really lose much value from bluffs
um
we can actually also see that we have
some shelves and then mainly it's going
to be the ace king blockers yes that are
going to go with the shelves
asus front
betting one third i think that makes a
lot of sense right for the same reasons

[1:03:45]
lot of sense right for the same reasons
we talked about so he i think overrated
his hand enormously
i still actually like my donk
you can see it does do some dunking 910
so the idea i think i think i think it
was on the on the right path maybe a bit

[1:04:01]
was on the on the right path maybe a bit
bigger would have been better the
three-quarter the one-third as you can
see jack's queen is still calling isaac
suited so-called and jack and suit is
still calling so probably i went a bit
too small
that is then a feedback point for myself

[1:04:15]
that is then a feedback point for myself
i think uh one third would have been a
better sizing
uh
yeah i think that's gonna be my main
takeaway but definitely good spots where
i found the river tank i would say

[1:04:30]
next up i have the jack 10
where
we called orbet we checked flop actually
it's a flop that we see some dunking but
basically non-existent he bets 10
percent indeed aces
slightly prefers checking but indeed 10

[1:04:46]
slightly prefers checking but indeed 10
percent is the correct sizing so well
played by him
uh
we are mainly going to be calling
i remember i considered the race i do
have to say that the

[1:05:00]
have to say that the
i think our race percentage
will increase and our call percentage
will decrease if we give it a
smaller race sizing is i don't think the
preferred race sizing
so
that's something to take consideration

[1:05:15]
that's something to take consideration
sorry bats i decided to call
turn as a queen
and now we come to the turn strategy for
imposition imposition should still be
doing quite a lot of betting aces will
always check
and on the river

[1:05:30]
and on the river
if it goes check check we should
actually not be bluffing our hands okay
now this doesn't mean the solver is
right the way goes wrong you always have
to figure out okay why aren't we
bluffing jack then an argument that i

[1:05:45]
bluffing jack then an argument that i
gave in game was that we're now blocking
a stan ejected equal to four by bluff
three
which is true however in
the solver is barrelling ace jacket ace
ten on the turn basically always
okay

[1:06:00]
okay
and obviously the jack then blocker also
goes the opposite way to jack's intense
so i think that definitely
plays part
if we then jam the river
see it should call king queen okay
actually i thought that
i thought he would probably fold king

[1:06:15]
i thought he would probably fold king
queen okay it's also for the king jack
so that doesn't help kingdom off okay
that doesn't help so
probably actually it's calling jack some
of the time so then i guess that blocker
goes both ways but it's fully intense so
like i said jack then because obviously
we will bluff something like five six

[1:06:32]
we will bluff something like five six
most of the time we are even bluffing at
like sevenths so then it purely has
something to do with the fact that we
uh block a lot of the heads that are
going finn is going to fall so if we
have sevens the full percentage of
villain apparently in the solver is

[1:06:46]
villain apparently in the solver is
higher than if we have jack 10 that's
why we don't bluff
if he checks back more if he plays the
turn a bit more polarized like
i see
more players do then obviously if he has
them more ace jack in his tent but then

[1:07:00]
them more ace jack in his tent but then
again the answer is
so it's very hard to say
then we had the jack six suited dunk on
the flop
which here indeed you can see we'll dunk
this some time
the board is a little bit on the higher

[1:07:15]
the board is a little bit on the higher
side let's say it is seven six five or
seven six four we don't get more but now
eight high boards and the nine and the
ten also are a lot in the buttons range
so therefore with less of an advantage
donk
this is in positions raising strategy

[1:07:31]
this is in positions raising strategy
and now it was up to us i remember
saying that i would like to have 10 6 as
a three bet which we can indeed see is
dominant then i said knight six well
obviously 96 is a straight
jack 6 is indeed the least dominant flop
3 bet

[1:07:46]
3 bet
however i do think
i didn't
i mean the reason why jak 6 is the less
dominant because it's blocking a lot of
the race fault so let's say we go over
the top again probably a lot of the race

[1:08:00]
the top again probably a lot of the race
now fault hands are going to be in the
jacks region
so
the queen jack the king jack
then
actually is more in the 10x region but
then again i guess it's more beneficial
the fact that we can sometimes refer a
very high straight uh

[1:08:16]
very high straight uh
turn or river verify straight with the
so yeah you can mix in some re-raises i
like for example ant like 910 i think
fine
we decided to call and on the term we
talked a lot about dunking just before

[1:08:30]
talked a lot about dunking just before
and i said we could probably just dunk
that range
which is not range and then i also said
probably if you bet 10 we're going to
bet more so here's 20 is the biggest
sizing
so
it doesn't have the sizing that i

[1:08:45]
it doesn't have the sizing that i
actually wanted to bet a bit on the
bigger side like three quarters and 10
or something so if you play around with
sizings maybe you will see a different
strategy
like a program like gto wizard i think
it's very convenient because it's all
preset but sometimes you know it doesn't

[1:09:01]
preset but sometimes you know it doesn't
have the sizing scheme that i think is
most optimal so then i'll go to piyo
rebuild the tree with certain sizes to
see if that strategy uh
is
better not necessarily better but if i
have a certain split or certain sizes

[1:09:15]
have a certain split or certain sizes
scheme in my head that i think makes
sense i want to check
it with piyo to see if bio agrees with
me if it doesn't you know i want to
figure out why not
but yeah jack six how are we can
definitely dunk

[1:09:31]
and calls
the king
and i better three quarters basically
any bad sizing issues of the time let me
see check six
i think
yeah obviously not space check six times

[1:09:46]
yeah obviously not space check six times
15.5 that's the dominant yeah so around
the sizing that i bet it
i bet it three quarters and it wants to
bet in between 86 61. so
play that hand or reasonably spot on

[1:10:03]
and then our plus are going to be made
yeah those high cards right the jack the
the jack 10
check 9.
sometimes probably giving up without a
spade and to stay in the dunk bed team

[1:10:17]
spade and to stay in the dunk bed team
the pocket fives we call them small
blind and here i explained also why you
should uh implement thongs in your game
on certain boards let's say for example
here we can see we don't bet half the
time let's say we check maybe this is
not the best part but you already see

[1:10:30]
not the best part but you already see
quite some pod controlling from over
pairs and basically by dunking you can
sort of prevent
bot controlling from happening right
and you could say yeah but we could
still check race but check race is
basically the same if he now raises we
can now come over the top so that then
becomes sort of the check race

[1:10:47]
becomes sort of the check race
um
so we bet
getting called
there was a
ten of diamonds we went for the over bet
which i think is going to be dominant

[1:11:00]
which i think is going to be dominant
yes indeed
wants to bet 175 i think we bet at 150
okay and i think on a river ace
five oh
i think there's nothing left to do and

[1:11:15]
i think there's nothing left to do and
jam
ship it in
let's say if the river is is a hearts
that would be interesting
yeah then we just switched to a block
bad sizing that's kind of what i was
intending to do

[1:11:30]
intending to do
[Music]
and it should then block some of these
accents
they probably have a frequency call
yes
quite a high frequency go actually with
the heart
so i think uh

[1:11:46]
so i think uh
this is probably how i would have played
out the hand on our heart so that's good
then we had the pocket kings to stay in
donkbatland
what i wanted to show you guys is for
example here we see the out of position

[1:12:00]
example here we see the out of position
call range
hijack versus button you can already see
deuces trees fours five sixes they're
already reduced in terms of how often
they open right there was one and now
they don't even call the tree bet all
the time right actually fours five sixes

[1:12:15]
the time right actually fours five sixes
sevens are gonna fall to the three bet
more often than they're going to call to
the three bet but then if the flop comes
six four deuce
you look at the ranges we still have an
equity advantage
he just has a lot of worse hands than
ours okay yes yes

[1:12:31]
ours okay yes yes
we go to the advanced pocket
yes he has some very strong hands
okay
uh for the
for the outer position here the cutoff
but we have the
we have the dominating overpairs

[1:12:46]
we have the dominating overpairs
in the 70 80 80 90
these are just not enough hands to start
dunking
okay
so if he does dunk i think he's just
gonna have sevens eights nine stands way
too often
and that made me want to raise rocket

[1:13:00]
and that made me want to raise rocket
kings you see in general pocket kings is
gonna race quite often i did actually
say that
i would prefer to not have to spayed but
apparently
in theory it doesn't want to have the
spate because i said if i don't have the
spade versus the perceived dunking range
but okay a hand that he could then maybe

[1:13:15]
but okay a hand that he could then maybe
dunk his king jack of spades so there's
more hands to get value from but
apparently in
theory or at least in sulfur land that
is not really the case but remember we
do play versus a complete balanced
machine
i also wanted to take a quick look at
the pocket fives that we played

[1:13:31]
the pocket fives that we played
against misses don't hate me 89
and
it was funny because i remember i saw
this flop and i was like hmm i want to
raise this some of the time okay
and we can see here that half pot which

[1:13:45]
and we can see here that half pot which
was exercising that she chose was indeed
the dominant sizing versus one third
however we see and then i said okay very
low frequency
and then i saw indeed pocket fives very
low frequency however if he starts but
if she starts betting
uh healthbot that race frequency kind of

[1:14:00]
uh healthbot that race frequency kind of
disappears the 67 that i think i also
mentioned does remain in there at a very
low frequency
uh
and usually you know when i record a
video i do try to
look for some extra spots
before she padded i kind of already had
the raise in my head this is called the

[1:14:16]
the raise in my head this is called the
hooking by so i kind of already hooked
myself on okay i'm going to race and
what that happens is you don't
um
your brain doesn't interpret new
information so then when the whole
puppet was put it
i kind of felt a little bit resistance

[1:14:30]
i kind of felt a little bit resistance
like hey i already felt like i wanted to
race
and i didn't really take the new
information of half pot in consideration
and i think it kind of also shows
how i played the hand afterwards that i
was
feeling kind of resistance in the line

[1:14:46]
feeling kind of resistance in the line
that i had taken
so yeah i thought it was really
interesting from a more mental game
perspective
i was kind of like okay this hand i
don't really feel like uh uh i've played
it that well and i kind of shut down
because i do actually feel like rocket

[1:15:01]
because i do actually feel like rocket
fives on the turn
is usually a fine spot to barrel
um let's see if after half spot
as i remember i talked about six seven

[1:15:17]
he has to dunk some of the time
six seven them would but this is only
hard six seven of clubs again very low
frequency
after one third i would have liked it

[1:15:30]
after one third i would have liked it
way more
i think it was an interesting hand from
a sort of mental game perspective and
the pocket five is basically always
barreling the times that it did raise
um
six seven actually is giving up a little
bit more because i guess
we bet on third

[1:15:46]
we bet on third
yeah so it's actually folding six seven
so then if we actually have the six
we're actually bucking some defaults and
the good thing with fives is is that we
are not blocking any faults and
obviously sometimes i guess he calls she
calls with worse in the ace king the ace

[1:16:01]
calls with worse in the ace king the ace
queen sometimes folds better ninth
a great merge so i think barreling here
should have been the correct play but i
thought this was a interesting hand from
a mental game perspective where he saw
me go into doubt and then in the turn i
couldn't really i just wanted to

[1:16:15]
couldn't really i just wanted to
sort of get the hand over with because i
was already in doubt that what i was
doing was correct in the first play
place and i didn't really want to let
that escalate so i think if she would
have bettered one third i would have
definitely found this barrel because
i definitely understand the concept and

[1:16:30]
i definitely understand the concept and
it's definitely something that i do do
in my game
so yeah i think this dunk we should
definitely attack hard
nice try kit nice try
then we have the pocket ninth
got the keyboard i don't think x is the

[1:16:47]
got the keyboard i don't think x is the
preferred sizing
[Music]
i think we want that bit bigger
to
charge some of our hands so indeed it's
like three quarters of pot you want to
charge basically if you ever now bet one
third first of all we don't do much

[1:17:01]
third first of all we don't do much
folding it allows us to realize quite a
lot of equity and most of all it doesn't
get much money in the pot right
he has a he has a huge advantage in
in equity whereas the equity or at least
again in the very good hands right here

[1:17:16]
again in the very good hands right here
we can see the button all the 70 to 80
percent and we have a lot of weaker
hands so
how do you extract value from a range
like that by betting bigger so he
basically missed one street where he
could get extra value out of my pairs
before i have to start overfolding when

[1:17:31]
before i have to start overfolding when
broadway's hit okay but he bet at one
third now call
there was a queen
very good turn for him and you can
indeed see that he's going to barrel the
[ __ ] out of it he's only to check 32
percent
and

[1:17:45]
and
it is a very good turn for him
okay
then
he batted half pots
and nines frequency caller frequency
folding we actually still want to have
the diamond

[1:18:00]
the diamond
yes okay so actually having the diamond
here is dominant i remember that i went
on a ramble in some situations where it
lacks bluffs i guess here he still has
enough offsuit type of plus with king
jack that
having a diamond is not significantly

[1:18:15]
having a diamond is not significantly
lowering his loss okay so i guess i
overrated that effect but yeah very
important to just uh
do quite a little folding because he
just has so many equity and there's just
nothing you can do if you if you start
to overcall here you're going to lose a

[1:18:30]
to overcall here you're going to lose a
lot of money
so
that was it
another play in explain hope you guys
enjoyed it i think there were a couple
of funky hands
let me know in the comments down below
if you would have played any hands
differently

[1:18:45]
differently
i hope you also liked the analysis there
was a lot of dunking in this video so
i'm very happy about that as you guys
all know i'm a very big fan of the
donkey donkey

try to implement some dunk that's in
game
okay that's that of the video i mean
nothing else to add terrible terrible
