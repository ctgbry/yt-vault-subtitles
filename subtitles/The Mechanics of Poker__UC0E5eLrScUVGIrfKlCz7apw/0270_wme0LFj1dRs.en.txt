[00:00]
You said that even prior to you know
winning the Kashkan world championship
it was already your best year so far.
What do you think was the main
contributor for that? Do you recall like
any big evolutions you made in your game
or as a player over the course of 2025

[00:15]
or as a player over the course of 2025
that you know put you in the position
that you were ready to take this shot
against the end bosses.
&gt;&gt; I've been an MDA guy for most of my
career. Like I joined Metagame. I was 5
years ago I was playing 1 cent to cent
like I was doing two and 5 years ago I

[00:30]
like I was doing two and 5 years ago I
had no clue any clue about poker any
clue about the about GTO I didn't know
what any of that was so I start to I I
joined Metagame and I was I start to
playing like MDA strategy is the first
thing that you you learn when you join

[00:46]
thing that you you learn when you join
metag game is like how MDA works like a
simplified strategy and so I spent like
two or three years playing only MDA
going up the stakes but just by playing
MDA and then when I got like to 200 and

[01:01]
MDA and then when I got like to 200 and
L something like that I start to study
more GTO and learn the GTO concepts and
all these things. I always had like a
strategy a mixes of both like playing
GTO but always knowing that the pool
tendences and all of these things. When

[01:15]
tendences and all of these things. When
I was playing the challenge I was
playing like 200k hands a month. So I
tried a lot of strategies like I tried
to play like one month I was playing
like only GTO. Another month I tried to
play only like MDA and was seeing what

[01:32]
play only like MDA and was seeing what
works better because I I I had to play
so many hands that I I think was cool
like to try a lot of strategies and see
what was going to do best. And one of my
classes with Salo, he told me like

[01:45]
classes with Salo, he told me like
Mellie, you are so an intuitive
intuitive guy. You always talk about
your intuition and everything you say
about about your intuition is like
always right but you don't follow it.
You try to follow the GTO. You try to
follow MDA and you don't go with your

[02:00]
follow MDA and you don't go with your
intuition and you should try to to
follow your intuition more. And when he
told me that I I spent like 200k trying
to follow my 200k hands grinding 200 L
trying to follow my intuition and I I

[02:15]
trying to follow my intuition and I I
just crushed it. crush it and since then
I just became like I can say like an
intuitive player like I go with my
intuition a lot. I don't I don't care
about deviating from MDA or deviating

[02:30]
about deviating from MDA or deviating
from the if I have the how you can say
like the feeling of the thing. So I
think that was something that changed a
lot like I start to believe believing
and trusting my intuition and by the
time I started doing that I just start

[02:46]
time I started doing that I just start
to crushing every game that I play. So
then uh if we look at the online poker
for example as a video game right you
you explained you started at 2L and you
you know you go to the next level the
next level the next level then I kind of
see like the cash game world

[03:01]
see like the cash game world
championship I guess you can kind of
compare it to like Bowser's castle you
know in in Super Mario you know you
reached the end level now it's up
against Bowser in the castle what were
like kind of your motiv motivations to
uh uh to take part in the challenge

[03:17]
uh uh to take part in the challenge
&gt;&gt; just playing against the best. Like I I
I want to know like how how well I would
do if it was if it's going to be like
that hard, if it was impossible. Like I
want to test myself like I was I am

[03:32]
want to test myself like I was I am
pretty aware that a lot of guys there
are way better than me. Like I don't
think like and the guys the time that I
have in poker these guys have the double
just playing high stakes. So, I didn't
expect to go there and crush everyone

[03:46]
expect to go there and crush everyone
because the guys have way more time of
poker than me. They can be way sharper
than me like but I just want to test
myself and see how I would go I was
going to to perform there. So, it was

[04:00]
going to to perform there. So, it was
just like a personal challenge for me.
&gt;&gt; Did you like plan it ahead of time when
you heard of it or was it more like oh
[ __ ] it's gonna start next week? You
know,
&gt;&gt; [ __ ] it. Seven by shot. Let's go.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Exactly like that. I
actually I actually started like a week
later on the challenge because we have

[04:16]
later on the challenge because we have
like the meeting of the the the team. I
was traveling with my family. I was just
playing my my normal my normal grand
grind on GG and other sides. I was
having like a a good mode already. I was

[04:30]
having like a a good mode already. I was
like 80k up or 70k up. Somebody told me
like, "Oh, the challenge is going." And
I and I I thought, "Oh, man. I'm doing
all right well this this moment so I'm
gonna take a shot and I live.
&gt;&gt; So it comes back to your intuition,

[04:45]
&gt;&gt; So it comes back to your intuition,
right? It's just intuitive. Hey, I feel
like it now. And my intuition said this
is a good this good time. You obviously
said, you know,
&gt;&gt; you're you're not ignorant of the fact
that they have way more experience at
high sex than you.
&gt;&gt; But there was still you you have enough
confidence in your game to be like, oh,
you know, let's give it a try. What do

[05:01]
you know, let's give it a try. What do
you think is like your main strength uh
coming in? Like obviously you were the
underdog kind of you said right in terms
of experience but I'm sure you have
certain qualities that gives you the
confidence that you at least think that
you have a shot right if you're if you
think that you have stand no chance you

[05:15]
think that you have stand no chance you
wouldn't participate. So what do you
think gives you that confidence uh uh
yeah to take that leap of faith in your
game and jump in. I know that I'm not
going to be as sharp as a lot of guys
are, but there are a lot of other

[05:30]
are, but there are a lot of other
players that aren't good as they are.
Like, they're kind of at my level, but I
think I I could perform really well.
Like, I'm really hard to toot. Like, I
can play long sessions and play my a

[05:46]
can play long sessions and play my a
game for long hours and not try to level
with anyone or get tilted with anyone.
And I also believe in my game. I may be
not as sharp as some of the best guys,
but

[06:00]
but
there are other other competitors too.
So, I think it was a fair
