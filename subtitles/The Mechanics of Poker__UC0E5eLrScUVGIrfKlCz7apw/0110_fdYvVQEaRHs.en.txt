for you guys

[03:12]
[Music]
checking what the queen 10 what he had

[03:28]
we have pocket sevens

[03:30]
we have pocket sevens
thank you very much sir king jack third
bear not bad
what you gonna do what you gonna do when
therefore bet you echo echo what you
gonna do
you're gonna flop a queen
it's not a queen

[03:46]
it's not a queen
that is not a queen
shouldn't really hit my range all that
hard
i mean i guess you could say like i
prefer to forbade
five bet a little bit more with

[04:02]
five bet a little bit more with
some of the hands that would have hit
this board like five sixes sevens
eights
same story

[04:15]
i think i'm just going to fold
maybe a little bit nitty but not the set
on table one
see if we can extract some value with
this end okay he starts with a big bat
i think it's going to be unfrequent on
this board

[04:32]
i'm just going to start with a call
it's a bad turn
for
the range that i think is going to be
three quartering with

[04:45]
three quartering with
next i'm just going to fold the check
full day screen without any back doors
he does actually barrel is interesting
ace four i think it's a finite as well
actually to uh
to three too big on this board

[05:12]
try a little donkey donkey i mean he's
got a call

[05:15]
got a call
yeah pocket aces
it's actually not a good call i would
say because you're blocking my main
bluffs
like my main blob is ace five
right that's like
if i can think of a hand

[05:30]
if i can think of a hand
you're probably look in that region
like ace five h3 a's deuce
type of hands
like i said the melee h5 because i would
probably fold some ace deuce

[05:45]
probably fold some ace deuce
as three and a turn
so yeah i but then again also i bet at
20 but it's a very good run out for me
he already been at three quarters
i mean i'm not sure but we're gonna flop

[06:01]
i mean i'm not sure but we're gonna flop
a second table one
a bit deeper
rolled high
wouldn't 100 frequency colors but on a
high number i'm going to and we knew
we're flopping sets god damn it
that's what we do

[06:16]
that's what we do
we're set floppers
what are we set floppers what do we do
we flop sets what are we set floppers
what do we do we flop sets flop says get
stacks
okay let me explain how let's go the

[06:30]
okay let me explain how let's go the
last tip i have for you is on small
pocket pairs
and these are hands that you can win
monster pots
so when you get delta pocket pair try to
flop a set
play it smooth and win all the money

[06:47]
unbelievable
he folded

dodging bullets
oh wait he's already gone

[07:37]
and that's why you do this guys that's
why you stop the street with the 5'4
they're like
don't see that coming and then we're
going to go into slow play mode for
amazon

[07:56]
keep post guys keep pose

[08:05]
quick go
check in the dart
flop a set on the other table let's go
oh we actually have quite a lot of good

[08:15]
oh we actually have quite a lot of good
hands
but stay
keep your poker face on welcome
keep your poker face on he checks
interesting

[08:35]
that makes me think he has something
like nines or something so i'm just
gonna bet small
and no longer pretend

[08:58]
yes pocket dance okay

[09:05]
hey weka what is the software gamble
gamble yeah okay i'm up to date
this hand is pretty close to six seven
i'm talking about

[09:16]
i'm talking about
nine times
i'm gonna try a little raised low
frequency low frequency
i think it's fine uh table one is
interesting
i don't think i think we're gonna have a
lot of bets here but i feel like six is

[09:31]
lot of bets here but i feel like six is
with a heart it's one of the few hands
that does want to bet
maybe even on the turn as well
but that is probably pushing it

[09:54]
but you know on the weka show we push it
let the deuce pass now we can no longer

[10:01]
let the deuce pass now we can no longer
vote better and i would say
that would no longer even be pushing it
that would just be spewing

[10:22]
he bets and i think we have of old
with our exact hand

[10:34]
okay

[10:50]
well sometimes check back here on the is
did you see what i think ace king of
spades particularly uh
not really that necessary

[11:01]
click on the turn here
over that small seems okay

[11:22]
it's quite a bad river the queen
obviously

[11:40]
i cut off button obviously i'm very bad
in color epmp i'm not very betting and
cut off i'm not sure

[11:47]
cut off i'm not sure
here this is mr sd-max on
2.229 that's really big
that's really big we do have quite a
high number

[12:02]
i think it's okay
i think we can call
one fourth of the time with sevens

[12:15]
this part is very good for him
goes for one third
because basically if i go 2.25 i mean
i'm already not opening deuces
it's quite interesting

[12:33]
do i am going to lead
i think 20 is probably enough

[13:16]
i should
not be sure actually if i should block
this hand
i don't think i
think i should have just bluffed this
hand myself

[13:41]
it would have actually been a fine spot
to just bluff my hand

[13:45]
to just bluff my hand
check race that's what we want to see my
friend that's what i like
and threes are just gonna get it in hope
he has an overpair he does
it's the wekko factor they think i have
seven deuce
damn
then they just get it in

[14:03]
then they just get it in
that's how it goes guys that's how it
goes the last tip i have for you is on
small pocket pairs
and these are hands that you can win
monster pots
so when you get delta pocket pair try to

[14:15]
so when you get delta pocket pair try to
flop a set
play it smooth and win all the money
let's go for reezy
gotta get a three bet
and which mood are we oh i got a cold
four bet

[14:33]
obviously falling
lots of very solid
moves today peak performance

[14:45]
not really sure i don't think the
session i think the session went
okay
i don't really recall anything bad
or extremely
good so

[15:01]
good so
but i mean that's actually most sessions
usually i remember my wife always says
yeah would you it always goes okay how'd
it go yeah okay okay okay
ah how do we do here
what do we do

[15:20]
i'm gonna check but i don't necessarily
feel that great about it but
and check calling is probably just the
way to go
you see with the king queen

[15:33]
also when the eight bars are going to be
very hard for us to have bluffs
all right guys i'm gonna
call it a day i wanna thank you all for
