are going across the ocean to brazil
again recommended by previous podcast
guest xenyaw we will have a chat with
the 2020
online mtt player of the year pedro
garag nani i hope i pronounced that
correct better known as figar on poker
stars he just had the best scoop ever in
his 10-year poker career and a very
curious to talk about the eight year
path he walked to get to these levels of
success
um winning player of the year last year
and then having his best scoop now
because as we all know by now i think uh
that success doesn't happen overnight
right adam
that's true success leaves clues and our
job is to bring those clues to the
service so you guys can learn from them
and yeah he's had a very diverse
background from our assessment i was a
questionnaire we gave him he's got
background in sports he's doing computer
science he's a keen gamer he has a lot
of uh attributes that i want to bring
out and he has to be interested to see
how his story progressed to being player
of the year last year so yes i'm super
excited
yeah i'm curious to get some tips on how
to become player of the year as well i'm
sure many of our listeners do as well so
without further a do let's uh start to
have a conversation with pedro
there he is
first of all i want to congratulate you
on your recent scoop run how are you
feeling
yeah i'm feeling good i think uh i don't
have a history of
winning on scoops i guess
so
it was really i've never had a scoop
title
so that was cool
yeah definitely
feeling good so the more of the story
straight away to begin with don't give
up right
don't give up i don't think oh well we
can talk about that later but
yeah don't give up kids
so
uh
as you know in the pot we like to focus
on the path that you have walked through
throughout your career
uh and given recent events right your
best scoop ever i think you mentioned i
wanted to go back to
the first scoop or a scoop-a-like series
that you can remember
and i want you to think about
what has changed between the first scoop
you ever played and your recent scoop
how has your approach towards a
scoop-like event changed over the years
i assume that the first group wasn't as
big as a success as you mentioned right
you had a hard time winning in scoop so
yeah like um
i have
some
uh
good opinions on like series overall uh
i've always been
a guy who
didn't
like
like playing in series actually when i
was playing mid stakes
um i felt like as
i've never been stayed
um
[Music]
playing in series
is like a way to just
massively increase variance
in entities if you're playing midstage
and not swapping or anything like like
like me
so
i
actually didn't get very like oh yeah
scoop's coming doubly cube's coming or
whatever because the fields would just
increase a lot
a lot of players
who didn't usually play just came to
play like
like me i guess
nowadays
uh
and
fields are huge tournaments are more
difficult buyings increase so i was just
a guy who
i kept to like i've never i kept like a
really small
uh buying range you know
um
try to play
not too
not a lot below the average buying not
too much above the average mine
so
i usually would be like oh yeah i guess
i have to play but
it didn't really get me so excited so
i would usually focus my grind
between series
um
like just grinding
smaller field
as small as you can get out of 50 dollar
binds and [ __ ] you
you're know conscious about the swings
that big feud event you were more
focused on the downside of a big field
event whereas i think you know the
reason why people jump into scoops is
because they have that dream they see
that first price whereas you saw like
yeah okay the first prize is all good
but there's a lot of variants involved
this could screw up my my year for
example
i think i think you can you can man you
can face like
i've never i've never thought about that
before but like
you can
like face or
imagine your bankroll
you you have an icm
like perspective on it it's like if you
bust you're dead
and if you double up
well you're still going to be playing
like basically whatever you're playing
today so
you need to conserve your bankroll i
think that that's something that you you
talked about i think life told talk to
you about
that a lot like you you said in your
podcast in your
30 minute video about your career
so
not going bust is a very good objective
when playing poker i guess
that's an interesting approach i would
say especially tournament players they
will have more of the mindset of
thinking big whereas cash game you are
even more of a cash game mentality i
feel like because cash gamers are more
of like the steady eddy and you know you
you don't take shots as aggressively
because there's less of a big upside and
i can imagine there's a big allure in
tournaments towards that upside right oh
if i only pick this then you know
whereas in cash you have that way less
is interesting to see that that you
don't have don't that you don't feel
that attracted to that allure of winning
big scoop events
yeah
um
yeah i've never been
very much
um seduced i guess by the
huge prizes because i knew that they
would come but like
it's hard you know it's just a lot of
people playing
you you only get dealt two cards
and they also get those two cards
you know everything can happens
and i can't imagine i've heard that
before that you were mentioning you were
playing in between scoops
because for example the week after scoop
is probably insane value right
yeah yeah it's just
ridiculous value like and from
i mean you have to
you have to consider the roi you have on
each bullet it's like if you're playing
100 tournament in scope you might have
an roi
a little bit bigger
than a regular weekday 100
but there are 10 times as more players
so like
actually your bankroll will decrease
more often
when you play
like
a smaller like even if you have like
a little bit higher
roi
on a 100 dollars from scoop other
like comparing to one non
tournament
your your bankroll is still gonna like
grow up
bigger when you play the
the easier or the the
lowest field one you know lower fuel
because
yeah
just
so like
um i just started looking more
to series when i was playing
like an api of 200 or 300 or something
because then the 1000s were not that far
away so i usually
like sold action
for many because
100 uh 1 000 1k vines are just you can
lose a lot 1k dollar from it's like
many hundreds
of thousands of dollars
um and that that's more interesting
because you have more action like
nowadays everything
higher than 500
it's pretty much like
not a good deal
outside of series
with gg it's different right now because
the 1ks are
insane value i guess even on weekdays
but back then like four years ago or
something it was just
not very good just very tough
tournaments just go there and just
darving sitting everywhere and
just like oh
maybe it's not my place here
so you so you were avoiding the bigger
series until your bankroll came to a
point that
like you said
going broke is not really going to
happen in the series and you just were
looking to increase your average buying
and uh siri were the opportunity to
increase that average buying you were
also i guess more comfortable with the
fact that you could go on a big
downswing and that's okay
it wouldn't yeah all right
wise it wouldn't take you out of the
game you could always hop back in after
the series is over
yeah it's just like it's not like i was
uh
i obviously was i was playing the series
but not as intensely
as i played today
like back then if i wanted to take a
week
off
during the series i would if i would
do whatever i would if i didn't want to
play it
i would play it's not that i was because
i see i see many people that are like oh
my god scoop's coming it's like now is
the time
and i was like no it's not not the time
the time is like all
period before the series because you
know yeah you may think someone like
don't usually happen like especially
when you're playing lower bands just
tough
stuff to happen
so from what i hear of it the intensity
in which you put into siri so probably
the volume and how serious you take it
because as you mentioned that now you do
see it more as okay this is a good
opportunity for me that is the main
thing that has changed
uh compared to your first scoop and your
last scoop
yeah yeah yeah
exactly all right
interesting
uh you mentioned that you got into poker
uh introduced as many by friends when
you were in university
and you started playing a bunch and
realized you had an edge okay
yeah where
did that feeling that you had an edge
came from what made you feel like you
had a match
well i mean
on the
back
in 2010 or something i was
already like like posting some
you know
in two plus you and i i had like some
kind of strategy like a default strategy
and i've read a couple books
which
obviously nowadays are not
good information anymore
but back then was
something
and when i when i was playing i just saw
like people were just game
you know they didn't have like a
strategy or they weren't trading poker
as
like as a game it was just
splashing around linking
all in
and i was like man this is serious money
here it's just
even even like
i think in brazil is more
aggressive because like the cost of
living here comparing to europe or u.s
is very like
lower you know
as you know
so
i was just like
man i can easily make like 500
a week
you know or something or for a hundred
dollars or 200 200 a week
in brazil today is a lot of money right
it's like way above average of the
population if you make 200 a week here
so i was just like man these guys like i
know i don't know [ __ ]
these guys
definitely don't know [ __ ]
and i'm like i'm gonna get better than
them than i am right now and these guys
are not gonna get better so like this is
an opportunity here it just viewed as an
opportunity it's just
yeah
so that caught me like instantly i just
yeah i need to play
like a lot of money just flying around
so you you really saw the
the financial opportunity you're like
okay wait if these guys are just
splashing around and i have a solid
strategy i will make a lot of money wow
this is a great opportunity
yeah yeah yeah just
a great opportunity yeah
what were some of the first uh
strategical eye openers you had where
you said like okay i you identified that
they were gambling so you you know in
order to identify that someone is
gambling you have to first understand
what is sort of correct what were do you
still remember something like a first
eye-opener
oh [ __ ] yeah this really works
yeah cause like when i started playing
it was just like oh this guy has ace
king or something you know
uh
and i i remember
one of the i think the first book i read
man i actually
i went to my parents house and i i i got
it like it's the
green book of poker you know
yeah i know it i know it
i don't think i got it here but like
we're just like yeah look at this
content but even even like even back
then i was like oh this is [ __ ] serious
[ __ ] here's like very bad
advice
oh you you you already knew that the
advice you were getting in the book
wasn't that great no from this book
like because i think it was not the
first book like i read a book called the
tournament formula from a guy called
arnold schneider it was like a very big
book
this guy was like a professional gambler
he made money
in the 80s or something playing
blackjack and him so he was like i was
trying to
like create strategies to beat games
and he said oh if you have 10 big planes
you have to move all in or something you
know
and then he plotted some graphs of his
results in tournaments and [ __ ] and he
had a way to calculate how fast the
tournament was
so i started playing sitting goes with
some push-pull strategy and that was
like way ahead of the time i guess
like 12 years ago or something
so that was my first
strategy and like later when i was
uh discovering like studying and
duplicated
that was like a pulse about range
you know ranges
and i was like
wow
this is [ __ ] crazy
it's like oh it's not about the hand you
think the guy has it's about the range
of hands the guy might have you know
so that was and i remember a couple
friends of mine they took like a really
long time to get it like i was like man
this is the [ __ ]
this is the [ __ ] it's not like
it's very crazy when you have to
change the way you perceive something
like nowadays is
it's probably not gonna happen you know
like this is the way you play and then
someone says something and you're like
jesus
you know i think that was probably my
first
uh aha moment you know poker was was
that like
transitioning from
oh i think this guy has a plus two just
ranges you know just opening ranges and
stuff
so
yeah that was that
so you go back
because before we started recording you
mentioned that you were playing in the
the local
cart room
over in kurichiba i guess yeah yeah
so you were going back to the tables and
you were like range range what are you
saying what is your rage
and if you mentioned the word rage at
the poker table people were looking at
you like what what's this weird guy
talking about
what do you mean range
yeah like
i think
i transition a transition fast
like from
a really bad
young brat you know on a table like when
i when i started playing i was just like
you shouldn't play like this
[Music]
you know seven months later i was just
like
just befriending the guys you know hey
you know nice hair oh
know dealing with some live poker stuff
so i wouldn't ever mention
any sort of strategic words at the table
like never
and when some guys like some friends of
mine would come to the table and they
were like
start
talking strategy and disable with me i
would just be like
that's just
there's nothing worse for a for like a
recreational player
to hear strategy talk at the table it's
just they can't stand it it's like
very
boring
for a recreational player even like
even for me actually just
not a place to
talk strategy poker table
all right listen there's noted if you're
ever next to a figure pedro at your
table don't talk strategy but you were
very rare right like why wait the game
is so good they i know things that they
don't why should i start explaining
myself why should i point them out that
they're making a mistake but actually
you said that in the beginning you did
have the urgency to do that where do you
think that need comes from because
there's many players who love explaining
other players how they played the hand
wrong and what they should have done
i think it's just a very childish way to
need to affirm yourself like i'm smarter
than these guys here because poker is
very social and
we have our needs as human beings i
guess and like confirmation is a very
good way to just feel good
like in the short term
you know it's like
i'm better than guys even though i'm
losing i'm better than them so i'm good
and they're bad
yeah just just a form of self-validation
and even worse you're you're putting
other people down because you're
pointing them out on the fact that they
did something bad and on top of that
you're pointing out that you are
superior in your knowledge in this field
so it's double yeah
yeah that's that's not really the way to
go guys if you're listening
not another mature way and also not a
very plausive way uh to educate your
opponents on what they're doing wrong
not just in poker
it's like
any examples
no you said no yeah i'm curious
in which because like obviously in poker
it's a strategical game you're playing
against someone um
yes like there's plenty of examples like
can you like i do
like i practice sports since i was a kid
and
a very common like gym talk
you feel like you're working out and
there's just like you see that guy oh
he's definitely doing drugs it's like
yeah that's why he got so huge yeah i
never did drugs
they're like oh man just
like
you need to like
i feel like in the gym
the gym is a very clear example like
people need to be like self
fulfilling all the time
because
uh and they start to take
talk [ __ ] about the other people because
that's that's a way to like just feel
good about yourself it's just
yeah that guy is huge because he's
taking anabolics
like
okay like if you want to get here just
take some drugs
what's the
what's the issue here i don't know
because like it's the
it feels like people they need to have
it's not like it's not i'm i'm not only
strong and beautiful i didn't do drugs
and that makes me a more moral
like
people in person you know like more
i don't know i did work hard
and this guy didn't because he did drugs
yeah i understand what you mean they
kind of get extra pride i think it's the
same with people who take pride in let's
say
they're good at poker but
they never touch the solver and they're
never going to because if they if they
achieve the amount of success that they
now have with a solver it feels less of
an achievement than if they did it
without a solver so they actually take
pride of the fact that they are not
making a very smart smart career
decision but not consulting a solver uh
they're like no but i did it all without
solver so my achievement is worth more
than your achievement yes exactly
exactly that's the same thing yeah
instead of like
like doing everything you can you just
no
i'm just gonna do the
old cool way because it's
tougher or something
yeah and basically if you can do it
old-school way tougher
you're proving to the world that you're
smarter so adam and any takes on this
what what is that what is the driver you
you are deep into human emotions and
drivers behind what they do i'm sure you
have a good answer on this you're like
these guys have no idea what they talk
about right just ask me the question
now you guys got it spot on in my
opinion i think it's all about
validation it's about appearance smart
smarter than your peers sometimes we'll
shoot others down so we can elevate
ourselves and yeah like you guys talked
about with those examples it comes from
this moral high ground where like i can
put myself on a pedestal and look down
on other people because i'm doing it the
hard way the right way the politically
correct way i know the guys are taking
shortcuts uh yeah there's so many
so many like oops you get from that kind
of negative perspective and yeah like
when you don't play that game and you
watch other people play it it's such a
funny but also like toxic game i i see
the same thing in the gym as well as
pedro said i spend a lot of time in gyms
and the amount of trash talk about other
people in the gym and how he's got so
big and how they're slimming down so
much it's like all right just gossip
gossip gossip but it's all coming from a
place of your insecurity is getting
filled and your self validations coming
from shooting down others which gives
you some form of good feeling whether
it's increasing your self-worth or
decreasing theirs if you can throw in
some moral high ground on top of it
awesome you feel amazing it's a lot of
psychology in there
nice
yeah yeah
like
in poker i must confess like
um
poker is a
is kind of
weird in a way that
you
sometimes it feels you need to seek
validation especially when
when you're losing for a long period of
time you know
what can give you
comfort
when you're losing like i've had some
terrible
like downswing so
i think there was a point i was just
breaking even in like
a year and a half or something 14 or 15
months
and sometimes you just need some
validation like you know like my comfort
always came from like i watched like
regularly
uh summer graphs in poker tracker
so
i know in entities there's it's not
there's not a straight correlation
between gpv bb
per 100 and
roi
but
at least it's something that you
can control like if you're playing if
you're winning
more chips on average than everyone else
so you probably
like getting deeper into tournaments and
that
like will make you more likely to win
tournaments so like and all this time i
was like
yeah
i'm i'm playing okay you know i'm
playing okay i'm still studying i see
him stuff
my gpz is good so
it's okay you know
and sometimes you like you're facing
like a very aggressive guy who likes
peels something off and be like this
[ __ ] here my pants is losing and then
you open shark scope and he's losing and
like i knew he cannot be a winning
player if you play like this
like when you face some strategy thing
that you never do if you find out that
this guy is winning it just goes against
what you believe so
it's better for your self-comfort that
you discover that
it validates that what you're thinking
is right so you feel better
about yourself in this time
and that i think that makes a lot of
sense
uh and i think every every every player
does that right you like to maybe
don't talk a guy oh yeah he's just lucky
uh so yeah so yeah you feel good about
it about your own downswing right uh
yeah yeah it's nice to see other players
make mistakes especially when you're not
doing so well it's like yeah you see
they're not playing that well either
because if you're doing everything wrong
and other people are on a some run
against you they find all the great
spots it suddenly feels like okay is
everyone just so much better and then
sometimes it helps to see other players
make mistakes you're like yeah you see
yeah yeah exactly
it's just
uh it's just i'm just saying that
because like i would be like yeah all
these guys in the gym they don't know
what to do but like
you sometimes like openly you
you yourself you do this kind of stuff
as like needing validation
especially like in a tough environment i
spoke very easily
and especially in the short term like
what you said the chip the gpv
if you're in a downswing for four months
but your gpv looks good you know there's
no panic but i can imagine that after 12
months or even one-half year you said
yeah
just saying about my chipping v graph
you know at some point it's like okay
maybe i'm really doing something wrong
and then you get especially you start
doubt starts to creep in when you see
guys playing with different than you
maybe alternative strategy playing with
this cannot be good and then you confirm
and he's also winning yeah then doubt
really kicks in
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah but it's uh
i think downswings are the only thing
that
actually makes you like a good poker
player because
it's just like
you invest in the stock market
it won't always go up you know it's just
you have to suffer
that's what makes it tougher yes
so i usually
try to see everything that happens at
the poker tables or within your poker
career i always try to look at what is
the opportunity and it seems like you're
touching on something similar here when
i'm in a downswing
like okay guys i gotta confess this
doesn't always go well okay but and i
try to always remember myself what is
the opportunity in a downswing which is
to lose less money than my opponents
would have lost if they had the same bad
run of cards
it seems like you're touching on
something similar correct
i've never thought about it this way but
it's a it's a cool way to think about it
yeah
yeah when you're in an upswing your goal
is okay how the opportunities how can i
make more money than my opponents given
the card distribution that i'm being
dealt right some people maybe when
they're in an upswing they play last
and if you still play more while you're
in your upswing
then that's an opportunity for ads
whereas in a downswing some people maybe
spew off more if you speed up less than
you made money so it feels like you're
making money in a downswing i think it's
very important to try to look for these
kind of things just to keep keep you
sane
cool
yeah i've never thought about it this
way but it's a
i think it's a good cool perspective
like
yeah yeah if you get a bad beat okay
your opportunity is to respond better to
that bad beat then
another opponent would do so how can
so the bat beat is out of your control
right but how you continue your session
after that that beat is perfectly within
your control and that will determine
your edge over your competition
yeah yeah for sure
it's very easily set now
when you get another set that was set at
some point you're like yeah
[ __ ] you uh mr wacko with your
opportunities
uh server sets are
you know that
like
what still kills me most is like
losing in the last card you know or just
i don't know it just feels i think i
think if poker is just
you went all in and the all five cards
would just be thrown in the table at the
same time it would be like
easier like
to survive
i don't know they should have that
function for us professionals i can
understand from a gambler perspective
this is a very bad idea this will
definitely get a lot
of the game but if we can just have an
option just don't slow ross just
until the river is dealt then suddenly
all the cars
you know
but actually i'm sure i'm sure there's a
lot of people listening to this and like
wow
my idol figure you know he still gets
tilted off rivers
you know
sometimes we think like you know people
at the top they're they're they're no
longer human but if these kind of things
for example can still tilt you and
frustrate you that's very concerning for
people who are trying to get to the same
levels of success as you do
do you understand what i mean like if
you look up towards someone and you
realize oh wait he's only human as well
it it makes it feel a little bit more
attainable
yeah it's just
man i think it's
you cannot take away the emotion in the
game because
it's such a stressful game and if you
don't get happy about
like
some regular stuff and if you don't get
upset about some stuff
it will be just
what's the point of playing you know
it's a game after all
if you don't get pleasure out of it
so you just have to work to this
emotion a will affect your game in the
future you know but it cannot be
just
whatever all the time you know
because
i don't know it's just
doesn't make sense
for me
when did you first learn this because
this we're talking sort of emotional
maturity right now but in the beginning
i'm sure you struggled a lot with your
emotions right because poker is not fair
you feel entitled why do they win i'm so
much better yeah
when
i don't know
i don't remember
i think i have
i have a bad habit of
not like forgetting what i was at some
point in time
it just feels like i've been the same
person forever you know
it's like when you go out i mean you
only grow a lot because people
who haven't seen you in a long time they
look at you they're like oh you're
[ __ ] old because like when you when
you see yourself every day in the mirror
you're just like i've always been like
this you know yeah
i get you i still feel 27.
oh aren't you
oh
[Laughter]
no i'm 35 35 but every birthday i always
turn 29 actually i've stopped oh yeah
yeah
i think 27 is probably the best like
you know
you're you're kind of far away from the
chinese but you're still in the 20s
and
30s seem far away so so end of twenties
i think is a good age you know you had
the time to build a certain level of
success because if you're 20
broke
you know it's it's not as romantic as it
is whereas if you enter your 20s you
know you had some time to build some
sort of career
you can actually enjoy it but coming
back to the emotional emotional part
because
to to give my my perspective on that
like it's very hard to deal with your
emotions i think then a lot of players
they sort of make the switch of like
okay emotions are bad i should just
control all my
did you experience something similar
because we find we try to find ways to
cope with the
quote unfairness of the game of poker
and i think a default response then is
to just
not show your emotions and then just to
keep it in
which is a good temporary solution but
long term it's not very sustainable you
experience something similar
no no no just
like from the beginning i knew that like
i cannot shut down my emotions it's just
it's impossible you know i mean you're
brazilian
no it's not human it's like no human
good point good boy good correction all
the northern europeans listening
yeah i know you guys have a heart as
well man i know it gets cold and it gets
dark where you live but you still have a
warm heart i believe
and uh
so
it's just like well i cannot
kill my emotions like what can i do like
i'm gonna feel stuff
you just have to work to this stuff you
feel won't like make you play less or
worse
it's just
this is the mechanism
i think it's
that's like
for me it was very logical
you know
like it's like it's like your parents
like if they're never fights
then eventually they will burst like in
every in every relationship you know you
have to have a balance between
like if everything is good all the time
then it's not good if everything is bad
on the same that's definitely not good
so you have to have a balance in order
to not blow up
that makes sense relationship advice
from figar is you need to have big
fights in order to have great sex is
that my
takeaway no i i didn't so i didn't visit
uh
adam uh
touching on points that's actually your
your area of expertise sorry for every
time hijacking uh hijacking topics that
i'm sure you like to talk about i
remember we had a session and you
actually helped me with this as well uh
of really
feeling the emotion and we had a whole
podcast with bennett pete for people are
interested definitely go check that out
where we talked a lot about this and it
was really
experiencing the emotion
and kind of creating a little bit of
distance so you experience emotion
doesn't mean you automatically have to
react to the emotion right creating sort
of a distance between the stimulus and
your actual response
could you yeah maybe give some tips to
our listeners
yeah exactly i think what pedro was
saying to begin with is we've got to
acknowledge first of all we're human and
second of all polka is a very emotional
game it brings a lot of emotions to the
surface because we put a lot about
identity into it we put a lot of time
into it and there's money involved and
then you throw in this thing called
variance and things don't go away and
you've got a nice cocktail for a lot of
emotions coming to the surface now as a
poker player rather than trying to numb
those or become a robot or avoiding them
you've got to learn to
go through a whole range of emotions as
a poker player and to accept them and
bring them in so the way i look at
emotions you have a trigger which is
generally a stimulus let's think about
the river for pedro someone hits a two
out on the river that's a triggering
event that creates an emotional response
in the body why because you're a human
and that emotion's gonna come up to the
surface and the brain doesn't like that
the mind does not like the emotion so
because the mind doesn't understand the
emotional response it tries to come with
some rationale or push it away anything
but experience the emotion we also
create a story around the emotion of why
this guy is an idiot how do you get so
lucky happened to me again on the river
we tell a story we give a meaning to the
events and this is like kind of
the kind of a petrol on there on the
flames that makes the emotion even worse
and this creates a response we either
act out or we avoid the emotion or we'll
do something as a response to that
emotion when we gain the ability to
regulate our emotions which i call it
emotional regulation we create space
between that whole cascade of events we
watch the trigger we watch the emotion
build up we see ourselves experiencing a
bit of anger a bit of frustration we see
our mind going
tell all these stories and we watch that
process we create space remains and over
time we become the observer of that
process and it takes time this is like a
real hard skill for
new poker players like it's this is the
thing i work with a lot of players with
and in the first one to two years it is
very very challenging it's even hard to
build a baseline for this because you
need to experience so many emotions
consistently and realize i'm okay let's
not freak out but yeah even as an
experienced player like pedro and wacko
you guys are still going to have your
emotions that come up it's going to be
less frequent but it's going to be
certain situations that cause certain
emotions when you see that happening
you'll realize there's a big story going
on in your minds that you're telling
yourself about the situation you're
struggling to accept reality because
reality is you've lost game over see you
later and you're trying to create some
importance this is a very important
event shouldn't happen to me why me why
now there's a narrative so to work on it
you've got to create space with that
story to observe your minds trying to
rationalize it but also
don't avoid your emotions feel them feel
the full arrange and i think this is the
hardest thing i experienced as a poker
player i did not have a clue however
pedro was saying we've got this warm
heart and we got cold my heart was an
icicle and it was frozen it had like
blocks around it i just put in this cage
i was like whoa someone's coming out
push it back push it back and when i
start experience emotions loss would
come up it was almost like overwhelming
at times but as soon as i started to go
for a process of not running from
emotion and being with it that's all you
need to do emotions are energy rising be
with an emotion all of a sudden it's not
not scary and you can actually make a
lot of developments with your ability to
handle emotions just by being with them
so yeah we could go forever on this
topic for my perspective but uh yeah
that's how i see emotions trigger the
meaning you give that trigger and the
response that comes with it that you
need to work on yeah really really
allowing the emotion in and i remember
also in the coaching session that we did
because
i
when i start rushing maybe
some listeners or maybe even better can
relate to that if i start to rush in my
game i feel like i'm rushing away from a
certain emotion so every time now when
i'm rushing i'm trying to stop and like
okay what am i experiencing or what am i
feeling what are my emotions which
emotions are coming up that i'm not
trying to experience by rushing through
a hand for example let's say you're in a
tough decision you just rush through
that decision because you don't want to
feel lost in a certain hand i might just
make a quick decision just to get away
from the spot does that sound familiar
pedo
um
no not not not for me
this is not
i think this is not the way that i
um
i don't know the word
i mean i'm very usually like
in hand and very like
focused i don't
i don't feel like
this is not the kind of thing i do
it actually it's just
it's cool having this conversation with
you because i think
we as poker players we don't talk about
this stuff you know usually
between profit players
it's like
what do i do when i go on tilt
like most people won't even know what
what do they like what do they do
like you know what what you do when your
children that shows
some
you know recognition you have spent time
developing this part of the game
like what people did just don't know i
go on tilt and lose
like knowing your exact point in which
i rush through decisions
when i'm until because i don't want to
feel the pressure of playing
and having to take take decisions like
this is a very
you know what you do when you're on tilt
right so
i don't do this this way but i do other
things that you probably don't do so you
have an example
uh
i think i get more
uh
i call down people
wait
i usually call down people but i call
down people more and
i
i want to go while in pre-flop more
frequently
i guess
yeah
so that could also for example i noticed
when i want to go all in preflop
it feels like you sort of can
i i will have that tendency when i'm a
bit lower in confidence because getting
it in preflop
if the spot is just plus a fee you can
no longer make a mistake
does that maybe that sounds familiar if
you're not playing so well if you just
get it over with preflop you don't have
to make more decisions on a later street
and if you're not feeling in a very
confident mood and it's a tricky spot
you try to avoid that tricky spot by
just getting it in preflop or you just
gamble it up
no i think like
this is true for cash games because
uh in tournaments there are spots where
you cannot call through it
you just you know
you have to shove or not
i think it's easier for entity players
to relate to this then
it's like i don't know if i is five
suited with party bakes
you open and the guy three best friend
cut off or something just
it's not a very good call
hey sean and that guy has it and you're
just like
i was happy
i think this is the kind of stuff yeah
so i actually we got we drifted a little
bit of topic but like good good stuff
i'm sure i'm sure the listeners uh could
relate to many of the things that we
were saying
but i wanted to quickly go back to you
playing in your local card room
kurichiba
at what point did you
decide like hey i'm gonna do this for a
living
you saw the earning potential when did
you sort of decided to turn pro was this
like a conscious decision or at some
point you're like oh i guess i'm
spending an awful time in this card room
and i'm making way more money than in
other things that i could make money in
so i guess now i'm a pro
yeah so there's no trigger
like
on off like i'm bro i'm not a pro you
know
you just happen to be a pro
and i feel like it's the same way in
many areas like
it's not like you get a degree and
you get a job and now you're an engineer
you know
like even when you're professional
athlete it's the same if you're a
professional
investor
you
like it's when you quit everything else
and just focus on that
um
i felt like
it took me a year to like
actually drop off college you know
because
i've always pondered like
i need to have like the way up you know
just
not gonna
quit everything and just start playing
so i was trying to like
barely maintain my
my college
uh studies
while i was playing and that was a time
where it just became unsustainable it
was just i cannot go to college it was
just like physically impossible for me
just like staying in the class because
i was making
like a steady amount of money in the
past 12 to 12 months or
something and then i
i was trying to work with my father as
well and there was a day that i the
first week of of classes
was like right friday afternoon i was
having
like a class
that
i already had before and it was just
painful just physically
unbearable
and i was just like i'm not gonna do
this just like no way i'm gonna do this
this homework [ __ ]
the i went to like a bar
like on the way home and i got a little
bit drunk and i was like just rambling
with random people
and i was like
i don't want to do this [ __ ] anymore
then there was a guy i think it was
this guy just
marked me
he
because i was like just mumbling
and he was like man
sometimes you got to do what you got to
do man just
go there do your [ __ ] i was like yeah
i'm going to do this [ __ ] [ __ ]
so i went home i was just like on like
bursting in tears like
just raging in the world so i got home
and i was like
went straight to my room wrote a letter
to my parents saying
this is what i'm gonna do there's no
there's nothing you can do about it so i
hope you understand
so my dream was to live in vegas so i
said i'm trying to like make my nature
live in vegas and if that doesn't work
out i'm gonna go back to my to college
and that's it
i like wrote up a deadline or something
because my parents were not
like who is who in
his right mind is going to support like
your kid like turning poker no just like
i wouldn't probably as well so like they
were right
and that was just
some kid
so i just
gave them a deadline just like oh i have
one year from now one year and a half
from now if i
don't go anywhere then i will go back
and they accept it and fortunately
things went right so i think that's
probably when i turned from
you know and i decided to
just play poker
yeah i think i think many people can
relate to this right if i would have a
kid and say hey i'm gonna turn
professional gambler you usually have
the good intention in mind for your kids
like professional gambler does not
really sound like the thing that i want
my kid to become and especially 10 years
ago where you didn't have that many good
examples for example if you would now
want to turn pro you're a kid in
kurichiba you want to turn pro you can
give the examples of figar of nerd guy
you know there's there's many examples
so yeah this is how they do it right but
10 years ago
the market was was not as professional
as it is now
no no
yeah it was just
yeah like a shot or something
i was pretty confident but
who knows
you know
what could have happened
adam
how did your uh
environment react when you said
bye mates i'm off to uh i'm off to
thailand to play poker
how did that go
over a new castle they were like not a
good idea adam or they were like yes go
adam thailand poker gambling this is you
well i did the opposite approach to
pedro and i bullshitted my way through
it so pedro did the honest approach
wrote a letter to his parents that he's
going to start playing poker i did the
invest so i just graduated from uni i'm
living in my parents house can't get a
job i wasn't trying very hard to get a
job but i couldn't get one and my
friends were like adam we found people
making lots of money playing online
poker do you want to give it a try so
we're giving it a try it's one for a few
months in england wasn't working very
distracted social life lots going on in
our yeah kind of social group and we
felt really distracted at home so my
friend was like adam let's go to
thailand we'll get a villa for three
months and we'll play poker non-stop if
it works
amazing and if it doesn't then it's a
fun story so i told my parents i was
going to travel in and i'd saved up some
money how do you save money i was like
i'm saved some money i'm doing
travelling so we're putting thailand and
all my friends that was a joke
everyone my friends thought it was like
what do you mean you don't i don't
understand how you're gonna make this
work i was like i don't need that but
we're gonna get a villa we're gonna play
poker every day if it works out we'll
extend it and yeah luckily same as pedro
you never know how much run good you
need in those scenarios but when you're
naive you've got a kind of ambition and
a dream and yeah things work out in the
first three months that became six
months we're now in year 11. i'm still
in south east asia i've made it about
two hour flights to bali in the recent
times but other than that i i've been on
the this side of the world from poker
coach and poker player so it worked out
okay but yeah in terms of support from
my environment i think it was my second
year when my mum cornered me and said
adam tell me what you're doing tell me
what you're really doing i was like oh
[ __ ] i want to tell i play poker okay
i'm playing this game two years two
years yeah because i was traveling i was
in asia and she thought i was just
traveling around backpacking and she was
like how are you affording this and i
was like don't worry it's nothing
criminal it's just a pin a card game but
yeah she was really anti-population she
was literally yeah
even like even year four i would go home
and she'd have like newspaper curtains
with jobs in the local paper i don't
know if you tried this
this application so it took a while but
now yeah i think by year five year six
she started to be okay with it i think
that the challenge is with your parents
in particular i think your friends can
get on board quite quickly your parents
just don't have enough information to
understand what you're doing and it just
seems reckless at every single level
even i remember trying to explain the
game and i thought i did a good job did
a powerpoint little presentation for
them and it was like this seems
ridiculous it doesn't seem real it's
like no no it is it it's a game we've
got edge in it and they're always like
well quit quit while you're ahead you've
done well so far quit with your head i
was like it doesn't work that way you
increase your age
so yeah it took a while and then i think
for me i accepted that potential
powerpoint presentations to your parents
it's just a simple one yeah showing them
graphs showing my win rate increasing
over time
however expected ev for the next year
ahead and stuff like that
yeah
it didn't work honestly it was a waste
of time i wish i had just shown them
the only way to convince your parents
or your family
is you have a constant influx of money
there's there's nothing else
it's just like
yeah it's been like 12 years since my
my father gave me money so that's you
know that's it
yeah there's nothing else
i i agree there comes a point where your
parents don't understand but they're
like all right well you must be doing
okay for yourself and if you look at
your parents perspective all they want
is for you to be okay you need to have
everything covered you've got security
you're not being reckless and you're
gonna have a good future if you can
prove that because you have a lot of
money for a period of time and you don't
need support you've earned the
validation and you're now an adult well
done you can graduate into doing your
own thing and running your own life and
you don't need their support so yeah i
think it's uh i think a lot of players
try to get that validation too early or
they just want like you said like that
like you wrote imagine your parents were
like
great idea yeah drop out and do it call
you you'd be like all right you guys are
a bit crazy
exactly
yeah it doesn't work that way so yeah i
think like you said long-term success
and yeah you'll just get validation
eventually or approval although just go
right do your own thing we don't care
just
we know you're safe and it's it's okay
so for you like yeah
yeah cause like
they like i mean my parents are pretty
old and they just lived a very
the life people lived
in like in their times
so i understand that
but like for example my mother still
wants me to have like
a degree
just i don't know why it's just
like
get a degree and like what's the point
of having like a piece of paper saying
that i'm something you know it's like
like she would love to
you know me i don't know
i don't know
maybe you should try out the mechanics
of poker we give a certificate at the
end when you complete the program you
can show that one to your mother say
look
i made it
mechanics like do i get like an engineer
title or something engineer poker
yes no
engineer co-worker
yes the mechanics of poker engineer
yes you look mom i made it i'm a
mechanic right now man
i mean when you get invited over to
podcast that's also a good validation so
if you just forward it to this loop mom
they asked me they invited me to the
podcast
yeah yeah it's really true in english
and you wanna won't even be able to
understand just
yeah
so i want to jump in at the start of
your before your pocket story when you
said you played competitive swimming and
i think recently you've competed in
crossfit what is it about competition
that you enjoy especially physical
competition what is about those things
that attracted you when you're younger
i've been thinking about that lately and
i think it's a good topic
topic to bring to my my psychologist
because i don't i don't actually know
and
[Music]
i'm i've been
thinking more about this kind of stuff
and
like i wasn't very good
at like as a swimmer i was
okay like i was
i definitely wasn't talented
and
like
all the way through high school like
swimming was
basically the only thing that made sense
i felt like high school was
just tedious
um
i didn't see
much of a
an objective there
but streaming made sense
in a way
that other stuff didn't even though i
wasn't very good
just
these parts
have this
um
trait or characteristic that
you you have some more control i guess
if you
like if you work hard you will get
better
and that's something that i think
feels more tangible you know i can't get
good here i may not be michael phelps
but
like i'm gonna be something and i'm
gonna improve and
and i felt it felt like improving was
was good as
when you're in high school
it's just there's no you have to just
fill tests and uh do homework
there's not much of a
end game there or something
so i felt like swimming was more
more mine i guess
than all the other stuff
and it made more sense up until the time
that it didn't make sense anymore so
you just got to the next thing i guess
yeah i can relate to that almost exactly
because i did middle distance running
from a similar age i think you started
swimming at 11. i think i started
running at 11 as well and yeah it's one
of those things where it's kind of you
versus you and you know like regardless
how good you are relative to the people
you can get better by showing up to
training three four five times a week
and you've got your own times that you
can compete against so anything else
that's going on especially when you're
younger you're a teenager there's all
sorts of exams and people are pushing
you to do loads of things that you don't
really want to do but like a sport you
can choose that to compete against
yourself and your work ethic and how
much you put into it will generally be
rewarded it's fairly linear unless you
get injured whichever you're going to
improve year on year relative to the the
work you put in that gives you this good
feeling that i'm doing something
worthwhile i'm growing i'm not sure what
your parent situation was like but my
dad was a former runner so i got lots of
validation from my dad but every time i
did well the rest like well done you're
doing great very good at school he's
like yeah whatever like nice grade but
get rid of that done good in the rest i
got lots of validation did any of your
parents like your swimming or were you
were you kind of um trying to oppress
any of your parents with women
no they they
they were i have to thank my parents for
that because they raised me
with a ton of values that i'm
probably gonna pass over like they put
me into musical school
they took me to
to the train to training
like every day
so they invested a lot of me in me even
though they weren't athletes or anything
but they were very supportive of
me doing
sports i guess
yeah
and
i have to thank them for that because
that was very important for me and i
feel like
um when you're an athlete especially
a young athlete
you're faced with tougher
things than average than an average kid
you know like
because like
there's not much sense of accomplishment
when
you're
in high school for example there's no
like what's the difference if you get
an a or b you know what's the
what's the well what's the point you
know
and
it was easy for me but like
you have to like
you you experienced a lot of things
that you experienced in poker
while practicing sports just
there was like
i'm sure you can relate to that as as a
runner
you train for a year and you your times
just don't get better just like
just like one year and a half and you're
still your best time was when you're two
years
but you still keep like working on it
because
because that's what you're doing
when you're on the downswing in sports
and athletes i think they're more
prepared to deal with
tough situations in life
i guess
and
and i remember my coach said something
to me that was like i
took for my all my life is like
nothing is lost you know this is all
training i mean you didn't you didn't
manage to
to improve you didn't manage to
to improve your your times or your you
didn't manage to win this competition
but nothing is lost like all the
knowledge all the other things you
gathered in this in this time will still
be with you and will make you like a
better person in the future and that was
very comforting
actually
wow that's some deep wisdom that i like
that and that's really good to hear when
you're a teenager as well because you're
you judge yourself so much on whether
you beat your time whether you won the
race and yet nothing is lost like what's
a great and sometimes when you're young
you don't realize like kind of when
people are giving you good advice that
that's going to come in handy down the
line but now you can probably look back
on those moments where like you said you
were i think as an athlete or any sort
of sport you compete in you learn to
deal with high emotions you learn to
deal with failure you learn to deal with
putting effort into something and that
effort not getting rewarded you learn to
deal with
losing on a regular basis and not living
up to expectations of yourself your peer
group so there's a lot goes into that
ends even though like looking back when
you think of the events you compete
again for myself like lots of the
running events were very insignificant
just like a local meeting but at the
time that was the biggest event in the
world that was the olympic final and if
i didn't run good the the things are
going to crumble in my world so yeah
it's good for getting you to respond to
those heightened emotions and i'm
guessing for you as a high stakes mdt
player when you're on a final table
you've got more experience of dealing
with like performing under pressure
based on your on your sporting
background
yeah
yeah definitely
so like swimming is something i
i'm very proud of when it's when i talk
about in my life you know
in my earlier like
days you know
because i felt like it meant a lot even
though
i wasn't like national level
i was stayed champion a couple times it
was cool it was awesome
but i don't think that was the point you
know
like i mean
you work so hard
in order to win
and winning is great it's just like
i can't you can relate to like playing
tournaments you know
um
it is awesome to win
but you don't win enough
time
remember that great advice nothing is
lost and yeah it's one of those where
you put the work in and you may not get
rewarded today but yeah i love that i'm
going to use that a lot yeah so for
yourself when you were transitioned into
poker what were some of the initial
challenges you faced we've talked about
uh the family not being nobody
supportive uh any other challenges you
faced in next year your first year of
taking poker or more professionally
when i was playing live the games were
so soft that i
um
i just needed to keep like i was very
uh
like i work at i worked hard like played
like five or six days a week
on a like very
regular schedule
and
that was great like i mean i i've always
took
notes not notes like i
input
all the sessions in a
session manager or something
so i remember one week that i lost every
single day for like
eight days or something i remember that
week
and the feelings i had
just like
sometimes when you're on a downswing you
just feels like
you're definitely gonna fail like long
term you know it's just something that
like if this keeps this
like if it keeps up like this i'm just
gonna i'm not gonna make it
uh i think the worst
the worst thing to do
about with poker is when you question
like the whole
jobs like maybe it maybe i won't make it
you know
maybe i'm not gonna be able to be a
professional player maybe that's
not even a thing maybe
everything is a [ __ ] there's you
know it's like maybe
there's nothing i can do when you feel
hopeless i think that's
that's the worst
about it like uh
and that was again i had to experience i
had experienced that sometimes obviously
as many people so
that was one of the toughest parts
to deal with
the uncertainty of the future i guess
so let's walk us through how you
actually deal with that i think it's a
really important thing to touch on and
like you said one of the worst feelings
as a poker player is doubting everything
your ability to make this game to be
profitable this game to make the career
work the choice that you've made if it
go pro might just crumble in front of
your eyes the whole thing might go to
the [ __ ] so in those scenarios when you
do feel hopeless it's probably the worst
kind of feeling you can have how did you
come out of those patches what are some
things you did during a hopeless patch
or a desperate patch that allowed you to
whether that storm
i have like a
a modal or a lot of money just something
like i think it's very valuable it's
like taking time off
you know
i think it's very underrated people
don't talk about a lot about it but like
every time every single time i
experience like the worst
like times of my career i just stopped
playing for
i just take some time off of game you
know not thinking about it just do some
stuff
i remember in this
in this
this week i told you about that i lost
like
i lost like a decent chunk of my
bankroll but not not too much it was
just
20 percent or something
you know waiting in seven eight days so
i went to the shopping mall and i bought
a television
well if i'm gonna bust at least i'm
gonna take something with me you know
something's gonna stay oh i have this
feeling about bitcoin sometimes just
[Laughter]
so like i'll just no okay if i'm gonna
bust i'm gonna have something so
yeah so like so many times when i'm just
down in the
bottom of the vlog just like
i need to go do something else um
go to to have a vacation
because when you're that bad
i don't think that's there's nothing
much you can do you know
you're feeling hopeless and
and your dreams are being shattered and
everything is going bad you just
go back see that life still goes on
outside go to the you know go to a
restaurant eat do stuff you want
and you feel better you know and then
you have energy to start you just start
over i guess i think this is a good
thing to do
yeah i think that's great advice and
yeah i think one of the most powerful
things of taking a break is you get a
change of perspective because very often
you're so zoomed in with poker and your
life and poker become almost like merged
into one thing and when poker is going
really badly in this hopeless desperate
despair state it feels like the world's
going to end when reality you step away
from your computer and step away from
the casino you're going to spend time
with friends buy a tv all of a sudden
you're like whoa wait a second life's
still good there's lots lots going on
and it resets your perspective and then
you realize ah i can still enjoy my life
without going well then when you come
back to poker like you said you're more
energized you're more recharged and if
you just power through those phases it's
really hard to get any momentum it's
really hard to change your state or
change your your way you're seeing
things because you've almost got these
zoomed in glo these glasses on which are
very pessimistic they're very zoomed in
and light looks very great for those
glasses and if you don't do something
remind yourself wait i'm a human i've
got more going on than this card game
yeah it's very hard to shift that see i
think that's a great advice taking time
off would you take time off and spend
with your friends would you do any
holidays what are some stuff you do to
get away from polka
i just do whatever like
all the things that i
that i enjoy like i was just like do not
for
you know
a long period of time like like
a week two weeks i think it's completely
fine i'm actually on a two-week
small vacation after after scoop because
i played i don't know 50 days in a row
because i was playing monte carlo as
well
and
i mean
taking time off is something that
i need to
in order to just feel pleasure about
playing again
you know even even when i did well you
know i did i had a great series
but like i'm not gonna enjoy poker if i
don't
enjoy life
yes there's no way
it's impossible it's like why why do you
play why do you have to win
you want to win a lot of money but
you don't do [ __ ] it
doesn't make sense to me
so yeah
yeah i like that you don't enjoy your
life you're not going to enjoy poker and
vice versa you enjoy poker but you want
to enjoy your life too much and yeah i
think it's really important to
understand what that balance looks like
for you it's like you said you you're
capable of playing 50 days straight
which is a lot but for most players at
the same time you're aware at the end of
it you're probably going to take a break
to recharge and re-engage with your life
and yeah just find that balance there's
no like kind of magic formula sweet spot
but i think understand when you're not
enjoying life and not enjoying poker
there's no harm in taking a break i work
with some players who really struggle
with this concept they're like no no
take the breaks weakness if i take time
off now that shows that broker's pockets
broke me it's like no doesn't work that
way you're mature you can step away you
can step back see i think it's it's good
to remind yourself that yeah taking
breaks to pit stop and look after
yourself uh very valuable how about for
yourself for anything you take any any
breaks when things are going badly or
anything to reset yourself
yeah for sure but it's uh
it's it's
it's it's always easy to talk about on
the podcast or in theory and every time
it hits you every time when you think
like yeah now now i i'm at a level where
that doesn't influence me anymore then
the next one comes along and you still
fall back into all parents and sometimes
you just need to step away to see like
oh [ __ ] yes yes i was i was being way
too pessimistic uh you know every time
when someone raised the flop you're like
yeah i said again i know like i know it
for myself if i'm in a downswing just i
see sets everywhere everyone just has a
set that's this automatic my mind just
goes oh yeah he probably has a set again
oh yeah he probably has a straight again
so i start to see the future as very
pessimistic so what i have to do if i'm
a downswing i have to reinforce myself
that the future is bright you know
people don't always have a set or a
straight right there's you know as going
back to the bigger helmet of pedro they
have a range they don't just so i guess
i stopped ranging people i just say now
a set again of course you know and then
you get that narrative right again of
course they have this again
you know and you have to become aware of
that and i think when you step back
that narrative kind of goes away because
you're not reinforcing it every day so
if you keep on playing on the downswing
you're reinforcing that that thought and
those kind of synthesis and it only gets
worse and you need to just step away at
some point
yeah and that and that requires a level
of awareness what better also said i
think it's very important that you're
aware of your your tilt triggers or your
behaviors when you're playing your c
game or when you're just playing bad
because if you're it all starts with
awareness if you're not aware then you
don't know when you when you should take
a break
yeah
it's also i think for me it gets very
physical
like
if i'm if i'm doing something that i
really don't want to be doing
just
i feel like physically ill or something
you know just
i'm not gonna put myself through it like
just
i have to stop something like
uh just means like why are you doing
this to yourself you know my body is
like you care about yourself your health
your you go to the gym why are you
suffering like this
just take a break man just my body
telling me
yeah refined your enjoyment right you
you talked about enjoying something else
but also refined the enjoyment in poker
when you're in a dancing poker is not
fun because you're not looking at
the opportunities you're not trying to
improve you're only focused on how
better running and that doesn't make it
any more fun so you have to kind of snap
out of it and see and try to make poker
fun again right first first two other
activities to give you a little bit of
energy so you can use that energy to
make poker fun again and then from there
you know poker becomes something that
you enjoy and that helps you achieve
more
like happiness in your life right is
poker is poker is a part of your life
that helps contribute to
you being happy right which in the end
is the ultimate goal for everyone i
guess yeah
yeah
this podcast is brought to you by poker
ambition where me and adam have created
our coaching program the mechanics of
poker after having reached high sex
poker ourselves we tested out this
philosophy on our cfp students which saw
them rise through the ranks and doubled
their win rate we then took the best
knowledge of that cfp program and turn
it into the mechanics of poker so you
can have that high quality content
without the long-term commitment and
often hefty price that comes with a cfp
program now i will be teaching you the
technical side of how poker really works
how to think about the game and how to
consistently get better and adam focuses
on the mindset and performance skills
you need to know in order to convert all
that technical poker knowledge into more
consistent profits at the table now this
program is high level it's made for
professional poker players who have the
ambition to break free from mid stakes
and move up to high stakes poker so if
you're ambitious about your poker goals
go over to
pokerambition.com for more information
and there you can also find a free one
hour demo of everything that is inside
the program if you have any further
questions don't hesitate to reach out
but without further ado let's get back
to more goodness in this
episode you
you i think in this meanwhile you were
every time playing live in vegas when
did you
switch to online poker
yeah so like
i went to to vegas with a 15k bankroll
or something
and i went back to brazil i had like 3k
bankroll
so it wasn't
definitely not busted so i started
playing
i guess i was playing nl50
uh cash games
but
it wasn't it was kind of a tough game
actually i mean
for me
and then i had i had some friends i had
a friend
alex he still plays entities
he was like man you gotta play
tournaments you're not understanding man
this is the gold mine i was like no
tournaments are two variants blah blah
blah and then like
i beat like every i ran like insanely
hot
i made like 70k in three months out of a
3k bankroll
and that was that was it for me i guess
i mean
i remember i won
i won
a 12
i think a 330 rebuy unfulfilled for 12k
or something
3 3 30.
and then on the sunday i bought into the
bigger 109 in poker source
and
and won it for like
35k or something
it was like four in the morning and
and i woke up my parents i was like
i won 35 000
and they would be like what what what do
you mean like 135 000
and then
uh
that was that was it
and yeah definitely tournaments were
softer than cash games
uh
probably still today
but it's changing
so i mean i think it's a very you you
need
you need a different skill set it's a
it's a very different skill set the two
like i don't necessarily mean
the actual technical part obviously the
games are played different because of
the circumstances but
you need a different skill set as well
right you for example you play long
hours for example you need a way more
solid b and c game because you're going
to play way longer hours than cash game
players who play for two hours take a
break right we are way more trying to
focus on playing a game where you guys
should be more focused on playing b and
c game well for example
yeah
yeah definitely
i i i can also imagine that after three
months your conditionings around
variants in entities change right you're
like oh wait there's actually way less
variants in entities than i imagined my
skill proves itself right everyone is
bad i'm good i deserve this when did
that turn around i assume you know the
next three months the next three months
they it wasn't like 70k every month
correct no no it was like
i started moving up in stakes
pretty quickly
uh
so that was like i came back from vegas
in
2013.
so in august
i was i made a ton of money in the next
couple months
then i started playing like 200
tournaments on full tilt those are very
bad tournaments
and then i lost like 8k in four sessions
or something
and i looked at my bankroll and i was
like
um
there's a problem here like if i can
lose 8k in the week it means i can lose
a lot in a month
which is like oh
definitely can lose a lot
so i just
and now that time like my goal was to
raise money in order to travel
so i went traveling
for
like
in south america for three months or two
months or something
because i recently had made a
a trip in
europe like a 50-day
backpacking trip
which was one of the best things i've
ever done in my life
and then i thought i felt like life was
about
raising money and traveling
so then i i made all this money that i
wanted it was way more money than i
needed to travel like i don't know
years
and then i went
backpacking in south america
and by the second month i was like in
santiago
and i was like
it's like when you're traveling is
everything is new but that that becomes
the
like it's everything new every day if
you have a bunch of ephemera ephemeral
experience you know
it's not
not real at some point you don't make
real friends you don't make
you don't actually know people you don't
actually know the places you're at
you're just
it's a very hedonistic
thing you know you're just doing
whatever you feel whatever you like
whatever
and i didn't feel like i was
accomplishing anything anymore by
traveling
i felt this urge to like go back and i
need to build something that was real
you know my career my life my
friendships my relationships
and so i just
i got i got back like
i felt like i thought that life were was
only about traveling and when i
realized that i was
tired of traveling
i returned and i started to
work
and
to play and i was
yeah uh
mid 2014 i guess early 2014.
so you're gonna you you were like i'm
gonna take this poker thing serious i'm
gonna be
one of the best players that has ever
played the game
no i no i don't i don't have this kind
of
i think like very high objectives are
mostly
bad a bad thing to do you know very
ambitious
because
you probably won't make them and that's
gonna frustrate you and that's gonna
make you feel bad so like
i think you have to set
like small objectives and then
you start growing the objectives like
one way you want
and i think that's that's the way i've
if never in my whole life thought that i
would be able to like get number one in
[ __ ] place never even
never decided was what would be possible
or something or
you know
just happened just
just
wasn't my goal
i would take it one step at a time
basically yeah it's just
you play an l 400 what you're gonna do
oh this
looks like an l600 is soft so i'm going
to play now 600. you're playing l600
you're doing okay
well now an l1k seems beatable
and then you just go with this process
and like
you you're playing nlp 50k or something
or whatever and you got there just like
i think the process is to always play
the next game
and eventually you just reach the
biggest stakes
i i think what that mindset helps you do
and i think some people they get a bit
frustrated because for example it took
you eight years to get to where you are
right now and many players that we had
on the podcast usually ranging between
five to eight years whereas if you're
playing 50 no you want to become the
best and that's all you focus on right
you want to play high stakes that's
going to take you quite a while
and
i think many players can get frustrated
where they are at that moment and then
you kind of lose enjoyment of the
process and that will basically prevent
you from ever reaching that higher goal
whereas if you just focus on small wins
what you're saying right next objectives
next objective you stay in the present
moment you're really liking what you're
doing right you're making process and
the satisfaction of reaching your
objective is sort of around the corner
right it's attainable and then you reach
it and every time you reach an objective
i guess you also gain confidence in
yourself like hey i'm a guy who reaches
these objectives and every time you put
a new objective until
you become poker player of the year 2021
but that was not your goal starting out
then what was when you came back you're
like okay i'm gonna take this poker
stuff series what was the objective that
you said
you still remember well
yeah i think i've never
actually because even when you're
when you're young you don't have
i don't know clear objectives but i
think
achieving
financial
um stability is something that i've
always
aimed for i'm i'm a guy who like
i want to be old and
and can be retired and do the stuff i
want without needing to work so like
i work to have
like a good future when i'm very old
because
you don't know you know like i don't
want to
be like a broke that
old guy you know
i worry about that a lot
so
achieving financial stability and
success
was
probably one of the main you know goals
i've ever had
okay and in order to read to in order to
reach that right that's kind of the
long-term goal you had to i remember you
mentioned you started playing the 200s
on foot tilt you realize that okay i can
lose quite a lot of money i guess you
also realize that you were not good
enough for that for those tournaments
yet
what did so let's put you you were
playing the hundreds the next objective
is play the two hundreds right
what i just moved i just thought
i just uh i went like i moved down
it was just very natural it was just
a bunch of bad tournaments
i was playing so i just moved down
just
i think in my
i was playing
avi
[Music]
if
through 70 for almost three years
uh
until 2017 or something ranging
so you saw that abi and maybe increasing
your volume and playing consistently as
a way to achieve your long-term goal of
financial success instead of
jumping up in stakes you didn't
necessarily see jumping up mistakes as
the way to go
no no i
think
the only way to go is to grow your
bankroll
sometimes
many times you need to move up in order
to
grow your bankroll more
sometimes you need to move down and
stick to your bankroll
i think it's all about poker is the end
game
is
amassing all the money you know
it's not about beating the next stake
interesting you know because i always i
always have the mentality of gay next
thing next thing next thing next thing
no i saw i saw more as a video game
because also like my motivation wasn't
as you as like i didn't play necessarily
the game for for the financial
incentives it it was it was a coin it
was played by money and those were the
rules but if it wasn't by money i would
have probably
i don't know if i still would have
played it but i wasn't necessarily
focused on the financial incentive the
game had i just liked the game for the
game
therefore always my decisions were also
different for example i didn't make
looking looking back if i had a more
uh financial driven mindset i would have
probably focused on playing way more
volume instead of
trying to
every time beat other players go up in
stakes one more right i thought that was
very interesting actually moving down
and for example grinding more volume in
the game that you're way ahead
you then associate it as hey this is the
way i'm going to achieve my goal whereas
in my head when you set the second that
makes i understand it now but that's not
really the way my
mind worked i've had this conversation
with
a bunch of people and i think
there's a very
maybe a cultural difference
um
i see
the brazilian players
like like if we fail
we don't have a second chance basically
you know we don't have
like social security
like
if you win
if you earn like
like a as a regular person here you just
gotta have a shitty life
so i think
it's different for us in brazil
are in other
like poorer countries because
like you you won't have a second chance
basically you know
i think that because a lot of the
players you know i know from brazil that
are very successful they share
kind of the same
mentality as as mine you know it's like
you have to be careful with your money
and [ __ ]
whereas people from europe or the us i
mean i feel that you have greater
greater social security like you have
more if you if you work in a cafeteria
or whatever you're gonna have a decent
life where you live
you know and if you have a degree
like your starting job is gonna be okay
you're gonna be doing basically the same
things you do as you're like richer
so
i feel like
europeans
are more
like
willing to take risk
in tougher games in order to just beat
tougher games because it's
cooler or it's more satisfacting
than
than the other people that's why
i think
like brazil is probably the
the
where most people play poker online in
the world nowadays
excluding the us but they have their own
environment but we don't have like
presumed players
playing the highest highest highest
things you know
because i think version of players they
don't take shots as much in order to
reach the nosebleed levels of stuff you
know
like
we don't have a michael adam we don't
have
you know
a guy who's just
ramping up in the highest games in the
world
like multiple bullets and stuff
because
you know when you look at the top top
top
i mean you you'll have a bunch of good
players but you have a bunch of
players who risked a lot to get there
you know
because of because this the
we only hear about the success stories
we don't hear about the failure stories
like if a guy tries to get to go you get
to the top you'll never hear of his
story
so i think that's
that's a different mentality of like
mine and other employees regarding to
the rest that makes that makes a lot of
sense right it's like human needs
usually certainty is number one and if
let's say for example for me i was born
in the netherlands yeah basically
a decent quality of life standard is
sort of guaranteed because i have a
dutch passport
even if i screw up my whole life i can
still because i'm a dutch citizen i
knock on the dutch government door i
move to the netherlands and say hey i
have nothing they give me a house they
give me this they give me that
great whereas i lived in brazil for four
years yeah and in brazil
like you said you don't have a safety
net if you screw up you're on your own
you can end up in the street if you're
if you're from the netherlands you
cannot end up in your on the street so
there's a certain level of certainty
that you have and because that's
satisfied we can play poker more for for
example a validation perspective we like
the fame or
we like the challenge because there's
more room for that so
yeah i definitely think that is a
that is a very big uh
very big difference so
you then wanted to uh you said the end
game acquire the most amount of chips or
money
um
what were my view yeah yeah no no
it makes a lot of sense uh
so then you
when i set a goal i'm like okay what do
i have to do on a daily basis in order
to get there
could you maybe walk us through
a day to day or week to week
how were you trying to
achieve that goal when you were grinding
through the the 40 to 70 dollar hobby
how did a week in the life of freegar
trying to make it look like
uh
i've always played
um
a decent amount of poker like
i definitely wasn't
the guy who
like played
insane volume
and i think i've i've
i implemented
a bit of
what i've learned in swimming in
training in general is like
i see people
say that they study
five hours a day or four hours a day i
don't think that's
um very
effective
because
you have so many areas to study and one
of the things that i heard you you're
talking about that you had a very
difficult time uh
of a different level between your study
level and your play level right like you
have a difficult time uh using
strategies i don't know what the word
you use use the so you have like
off-game knowledge in-game knowledge
yeah yeah yeah
so
i usually study
like
simple spots a lot of the time and
entities you need to be sharp about
calling ranges shopping ranges so this
kind of stuff who is very
uh
you need intense work i guess to do i
would just do it like for example i
would shove
or call a show of an affinity and i
wasn't out so that's easy to solve and
sometimes i would solve it immediately
after it hadn't happened like
you just know that i did right or or
didn't do
that i would do constantly but like
learning a new skill like
i think it takes time
i don't think you can learn
a bunch of things without applying them
so like
oh
cool you studied you studied five hours
of
turn barrels or something so like when
you go to play it's always gonna be
different
and
if you don't apply it you're just gonna
forget it so like
i think i think i was
i usually studied like theory
twice a week or something
and
and i think i was very good at
understanding my weaknesses and what i i
had to study
and then
just studying
a lot so like
for example i think my stronger my
strongest position today is the big
blind
because i always thought it was the
hardest one
so i needed to
just nail that
and
yeah it took me years of doing this
study like two three hours one day
applying the next four days studying
two three hours four hours a day
applying the next four or five days and
then obviously
uh checking on the data i had about
myself if i was
doing
as i was supposed to so
very
simple
methodic
kind of way to
approach the game
that's very consistent
yeah consistent
just like in sparks you do that you
don't learn
a lot of new things
it's mainly about wait
knowing your your flaws
like oh i need to change this and then
and you need to work
a lot in order to
improve
like when you're training in sports in
swimming or running or anything you know
you cannot go to television to the
notebook and see like
how does the arm in the swimming you
need to be a little bit down so you
don't spend like five hours doing that
you just
like you know
what it's supposed to be and you have to
like practice a lot in order to
to achieve real change i guess or
improvement
and also i guess with the swimming
experience you learned that success
doesn't happen overnight right so i
guess maybe you were also a bit more
patient in poker you knew it was a long
term game
yeah yeah sure yeah
i spoke to some
some guys like
who are playing very high stakes poker
and
very high stakes tournament poker
players
and a lot of them were just like
so in our hurry you know
next year i need to be playing the 100ks
and i'm like
it doesn't happen like that you know
you're not going to be playing 100k next
year probably it's just
what do you need to
in order to play 100ks like
first of all you need 10 million dollars
or something
and
after
you know it's not like that you're not
going to be playing case it's like
people are just trying to like
no next year i'm going to be playing
i'm playing mbi 100 i want to play the
one case it's probably
slow down man just like
you have the whole life out of you just
it's probably not gonna work
but i think of
i've always been pretty
like honest
like to myself
not being very
uh
eluded about
you know the
success in the short term
that it just like took me
if you if you see my like my graph in
the
which is very
not happened like my shark scope was
just
before
the pandemic was just
not very
um
it was not a roller coaster
steady eddy
so that's it's interesting point that
you brought up i think it's very
important if if you notice that in
yourself right that you say oh i need to
play this within a year you would have
to stop down and be like okay
why is this so important to me and
usually it's right we try to get
somewhere because we want to feel a
certain way right we want to obtain
something and that makes us feel a
certain way right or that that's a
certain validation and usually when you
start chasing that what happens is it's
very hard to be happy with what you've
got right now in the present moment in
the process and in the end the current
moment the process is the only thing
that can actually make you get there
and then every time let's say for
example you have to go and you go in a
downswing in three months you'll be very
frustrated because that downswing
is in the way of you reaching that
reaching that goal within the end of the
year
and therefore you only start being more
frustrated you will play even worse
making the chance of you getting there
actually only slimmer so i think
actually
either constantly or unconsciously that
mindset really helped you get there
right and usually
the the
the the sort of solution to that is
okay what is the feeling that i'm after
when i'm going to reach those honduras
case and how can i experience that
feeling right now in the present moment
and
as soon as you already can try to
experience that more on a day-to-day
basis you feel the need less in order to
get there to rush there
and as a result you actually get there
faster because you're not going to walk
around frustrated that you're not there
yet right because you know if you're
just already happy with your life
uh
you will see you know we're talking a
bit uh we're going a bit maybe a bit
spiritual for some listeners here but
you know then you you feel good and i
believe a lot then if you feel good if
you're positive you attract a lot of the
same and if you're ever time negative
you will attract more negative [ __ ] from
getting to you right because you're
frustrated you're seeing all the
negative things that happen and only
more negative things will happen right
that's kind of the
glasses that you have on
yeah yeah definitely
you
i often you you also mentioned that uh
in the question that we gave you you
choose that your team player
did
i assume
you didn't reach it alone i assume
sometimes you talk to other players
at which do you remember certain players
that really helped you in your career
and
trying to move up the stakes or trying
to reach your end goal
to amass all the chips were there
certain players that had a big impact in
your career
um
when i started
playing
uh live i was
mostly by myself or in
and on some videos
but i always talk strategy with other
people right
that's
just
we are social beings
right and um
but like i've never
been part of a
of a stable or a
state i didn't
i've never had this taking
contract or anything
so
[Music]
but like
like four bed you know the team the four
bed team in brazil no
wow there's a like
probably the largest entity table of the
world yeah it's in brazil like i was
friends with a bunch of these guys
and you know you just
talk strategy of people and suddenly
some very
i call them
like a corridor talks
sometimes
you just
just click something
and then you just go and
uh
go search for it you know
many times you're just like spending
hours and hours trying to crack
something and the thing that helps you
crack it just someone says something to
you and just changes their perspective
so i think
i i lived in a house a house with poker
players for six years
i haven't had any deals with them or
anything
but i talked a lot
strategy and they all of them they
worked for poker teams so we were not
actually allowed to study together
but we would
talk strategy in general you know i
couldn't
watch
a video they made or a lesson or watched
some pdfs or anything
but there was a lot of like
conversations it's like
for example
oh
yesterday
i discovered that queen high boards are
overfolded to check raise
someone tells you that
and you're like
oh
cool
then you go oh it's actually overfolded
and then you just
print money on that for a
ton of years you know still overflowing
till today and uh
so this kind of stuff i think it was
very
very helpful this is like something
someone says something
or we talk strategy and just go let me
look into that and then
i have a bunch of players like i could
say victor
uh
other players i other people i lived
with helped me a lot develop
uh andre
you probably don't know any of them
and uh
yeah and then today
i have all like guys from night tales
we generate content together
study together and and stuff
so
[Music]
yeah oh i had some coaches actually
just not many
i
had coaches with couple friends andre
and seiji who was actually like playing
xx entities right now
back in the day
uh
felipe boyanovsk
he
he coached me
i have like one of the
best theory classes ever with him
so that
really
probably
some
some coaches i had with him
were
[Music]
like game changers for me
in the way i approached theory i guess
could you maybe give an example
of something that's only clicked without
giving you know you don't have to give
away everything away of course but
i think one of the
toughest things about
poker or hold him
is to
realize that it's a
multi-street game
and that has
very important very important
mathematical consequences
on matting frequencies and stuff
and
he
taught me
with an example about
um
for example if you face
a balanced
a balanced uh turn
if the guy is if the guy is supposed to
be balanced on the river
but he he only has that range on the
turn
then you cannot pay you you cannot you
cannot continue with any blood catchers
because you're only increasing the pot
in order to make a break even decision
on the river so if the guy is under
blood from the turn
you just cannot continue
and that's why you need to be more
aggressive in a turn that's why you need
to be have more bluffs on the flop on
the turn
to get to the river in order to
incentivize the players you're playing
against to pay you off sometimes because
otherwise they're not incentivized to
continue and
so like
this was
the most important concept like ever for
me i guess
in terms of theory
and that changed a lot of
my my perspective
sometimes in terms of applying that
yourself making sure you carry enough
bluffs to the river or you would see
spots where hey this is a classic spot
with the way people construct their
ranges that they will not
continue enough bluffs
and therefore i should now already fall
because their river bearing frequency is
just gonna be way too high because they
don't have enough bluffs uh usually like
this on the turn
yeah more like that because uh
especially five years ago
people were much less aggro than they
are today
so that was
man it was just a bunch of
everyone was needy and the guys who were
considered blues
back then today they were just normal or
you know
yeah they need to yeah
yeah
yeah the loose guys of 2015 are the
needs of today definitely yeah i
considered my game a couple years like
four years ago three i was considered
you know a bit more aggressive but now
like these new kids these new kids on
the street jesus
they they're taking youtube
yeah yeah they're renting out the games
it's like okay that's everywhere folds
nowhere okay so this is how the game is
played nowadays
yeah because like for example
back when i started using bio which was
you would
you know there's a king high board you
have king ten
and you face a three barrel
and the guy is on the hijack
and tayo was just like okay i'm gonna
call
and just like yeah so if you just call
down people every time and be like
these guys always have it it's
impossible
then when you look a little bit into it
if you change the frequencies on the
turn if they under bluff by 10 and
everything is default
and you just see the numbers and people
are under blocking like 95 percent of
people were very above the turn
five years ago today no today
some people might be even overbluffing a
lot many people
but back then was very important and
knowing why that mattered was really
important for me it's just not trying to
copy the server's
strategy is understanding why that
happens
so that was one thing that really
sticked into my mind till today
yeah so going from i call because the
solver calls king 10 and we're not
supposed to fall top pairs it's like
wait a second
why in theory don't we fall top paris
why in theory do we call down this king
because then i what you're describing is
there is a
little feeling in your belly every time
you call down with king 10 because the
soldier says so that's like it this
doesn't feel right and then i guess it
was his explanation that you were like
ah that was what my intuition was
telling me all this time
yeah yeah exactly
yeah and understanding why you should be
more aggressive yourself as well
you know
um
yeah but especially in indeed usually
when you learn theory
and especially i like to especially
study theory
in terms of what the aggressor what the
guy with initiatives have to do because
if you know that then you kind of
already are studying the opposite way of
the three as well right you're studying
how you should approach a spot and then
you usually find out hey this is
probably not happening so let me see
what the correct exploit is
yeah i think in general
usually aggressor spots
there are more approach or at least i
personally approach them more
gto as we call them whereas reactive
spots where you're reacting to people's
strategies there's more room for
trying to see hey i know how this spot
is supposed to be played there could be
an unbalance here
yeah my thoughts on theory is just you
need to learn theory in order to know
what your opponents are
doing wrong or right i think this is the
main
goal of learning poker theory it's not
about selecting the right suit of the
ace king you know like [ __ ] that in my
opinion it's just about
like trying to understand what people
should be doing
because if you don't you don't have you
don't have a starting point
you don't know like oh i do this exploit
here because i i i'm good
now if you don't know what the
theory
says you're just
just doing whatever you know
so gto is a baseline where you need to
have a good feel about it
but you will never be able to copy and
many times you will you won't be the
best decision but if you don't know
you don't have a solid theory background
you won't be able to explain people
that's my view
the ultimate goal of my poker is
explaining people yes
but if you don't know the baseline
you'll never know if you're doing it
right or if you're doing it wrong
that's uh i i i completely i 100 agree
with you before the pot
started i asked you you know what you
want to talk about then you mentioned
like yeah we could talk a little bit
about how i perceive the game well this
is one of the examples
i mean the question is how do you
perceive the game is quite broad
yes i still think i'm gonna go with it
so maybe maybe we can rephrase it more
in a question like okay i'm a mid stakes
mtt player right now or i'm a low sex
mtt player
how do you perceive the game that's
different than a lower midstage player
that perceives the game that allows you
to play higher and have a higher win
rate than a low mid-six entity player
you gave already an example that you
knew more theory like carrying more
bluffs on the turn towards the river so
you're incentivized your
the other player to call you
right there was one example that you got
from coaching
uh and uh studying theory so you know
how to exploit your population that's i
guess a big part of your philosophy as
well
which other common
mistakes you see low to mid 6 players
and entities make that prevents them
from moving up
um
i think tournament poker has more
nuances then
like cash games
um
without i think like tournament strategy
it's pretty much well
um
this uh developed nowadays
like you can find
a lot of good content pretty much
anywhere if you just search it um
like tables
you can
you can buy
sims you can buy
icm simulations
so the technical part i think is pretty
much
there's a lot of content
but i see people like making a lot of
mistakes that don't have to do with um
how you play
just play i think people
tournament has has also this
this characteristic of
uh
there there are differences between
early ragging or late wrecking
or middle rigging there's a lot of
things that people don't actually think
about all the time
that's important
like when to resist register
but i think most of the time people are
playing
like on
bad
sites
like if if i would be playing
mistakes right now
uh i see a lot of people who don't play
winamax who don't play
like bulldog who don't play
a bunch of poker sites that has
have a lot of value to mistakes players
uh i think people just
don't go after this kind of stuff
looking for the right games you play
a lot of a lot of people playing 12
tables on poker stars in gga like peak
time 3 p.m here and i'd be like
i don't think that's the way to go you
know
like some i see i see some games like 50
tournaments on poker stars that are kind
of
quite tough they're not very like soft
you know there's a high rate
spot
like i would say
study a lot of icm stuff
look for good games
and don't
play
higher stakes like than you should
because i think
shot taking
recklessly is
mainly probably the biggest issue of
people
ago look at this 1k main event of scope
here
if you're playing adi 100 i mean
you should not be playing i mean you
should sell a lot of your action it's
just people just don't do that people
just try shot taking all the time and
they just stay in the same
buying level
because of shot taking
and um
[Music]
yeah i think that's it
i have very good very good advice and i
couldn't
agree more people put so much time into
trying to improve their technical
knowledge or trying to get better in one
specific spot where
yeah like you said just switching sites
will probably increase their win rate
the biggest right now or people often
put in so much time and very small
nuances in the spot where it's like hey
if you invest those three hours in
learning how to exploit the recreational
better that probably has a higher return
of investment of those three hours right
yeah and that also actually what you
said about the shot taking comes back to
your first example that you gave about
seeing your bankrolls or taking icm
considerations people maybe look like do
i beat this 1k event in scoop right now
if that's the question that they asked
himself and the answer is yes they jump
in but there's so much other things to
take in consideration but you're clearly
taking consideration that they probably
don't
sometimes it doesn't matter if you beat
the game or not you know no i i actually
remember a student
he would he would grind i think on
average 200 no
but he he had the bankroll to play
higher and i remember once he
he said oh i won a 25k yesterday i'm
like okay you don't win 25k or 200 but
he played some 5k
and
and i was like
because he asked him themselves the
question do i beat this game and that
was yes but obviously after that session
he couldn't go back to his normal grind
anymore he couldn't take it serious
so i said what was your long-term
objective that was that you wanted to
consistently get better in poker and now
you just jump into a game because you
thought you were placifi but now he had
trouble picking up his normal grind
again for the next couple of months
basically so that was a good example of
he asked himself the wrong question or
he jumped into the game with the wrong
criteria and not having the bigger
picture in mind and i think a lot of
players do this wrong registering a 1k
scoop from what i hear from you
yeah just there's a bunch of tournaments
that are
very good you know
but you
for example the triton
the
the high roller ball it's a 250k
tournament it's a very good tournament
but there are a lot of recreationals
that doesn't mean i'm gonna play it
because it's
[ __ ] 250k
just
sometimes you have to take care of your
bankroll man and not like chase i
remember
when i when i was playing api
one two hundred i looked at the
do you know the schedule of the
poker sites like
the tournaments
no there's a five
530 dollars
progressive like the bounty you know
poker stars like daily
so when it started and i was playing ebi
uh 100 150 i would just open it i would
look it i was like oh this is the
softest tournament ever
and i'll be like i can't play
because
i need to go like for three bullets and
that was probably what my whole station
was gonna cost or something
so i remember i grinded for a long
period of the time
before i started
taking shots
at it
until i was playing it regularly you
know
i think that's uh
have patience i guess you know
respecting what you can and what you
cannot play
yeah
seeing the reality as this and playing
within the rules of the current reality
and i think that's valid even for people
who play
in stables
you know
i mean you you throw the
the variance to the people who are
staking you
but
the makeup is yours
you know yeah so if you
the people are like ah but i play sticks
so it doesn't count but yeah so i can
shut down if you play
yeah it can take forever and like and
because like for the team it's very
interesting to have a bunch of players
playing the
the best tournaments right
but singing like individually
for each one of them it might not be
good you know because people are getting
into makeups
and
like for example a pocket team has
100 people playing
100 abi
obviously they want 100 people playing
the 1k scoop main you know
like for the team is good but for the
individual players it's not good so you
must be able to realize that this is
like too expensive for me can i sell
this action
can i swap this action with someone can
i
you know because
when you see there's
every sunday there you have a spot to
shut day
a very good tournament and if that's
inside your buying strategy it will cost
you a long term like in one two three
years because
it's harder it's hard to win these
tournaments
like
i've been playing the two one case
max bullets for the past three years and
i found a table like the one case in the
on sunday in the
gg and i
fight
i haven't made a fan table for something
you know
just it can't happen
it probably will happen
sometimes
sometimes you're gonna
you're gonna be
uh like experience a tenkanzer and win
the 10k scoop main
twice
yeah but and then and then it's
important to realize that there was
quite a lot of a lot of luck involved
but the ego
usually doesn't really like to destroy
the the the truth with reality basically
right if you do very well we like to
think now yes the true skill coming out
now right just like you when you started
playing tournaments with big 70k it's
like this is fair right and if if we
lose its variance but if we win it's
perfectly fair right it's yeah you
deserve that
we deserved it actually another funny
point or funny point another interesting
point that you touched on in terms of
the game selection uh
i think also again it comes back to what
we talked about earlier people take more
pride in like yeah but i play stars and
gg
it's like oh okay then so they're like
ah but you're not doing so yeah but i
play stars in gg those are tougher games
and take and then you look at them like
why does not makes you smarter
exactly but it's this and some people
like oh i could believe that that's
stupid
i grabbed an l500 on pokerstars i was
like why the hell was 500
yeah exactly if you're interested in
making money that's probably not a good
idea
yes
you could be a great player but you
should use that scale in games that are
very soft in order to make even even
more money sure grinding 500 zoom again
if you're a european that just does it
purely for the challenge and if that's
really what's important to you then fine
but don't
come crying after a year like oh i only
made so much money and i'm like you only
play 500 zoom if making the most amount
of money was your goal you should have
usually
not played that game right
but
the the guys who game select they don't
say anything because they don't want
other people to join their games right
so they create i would almost say that
they're there every time rico yeah yeah
play on stars play on gg yeah yeah just
stay there yeah no bomb hunting is bad
and then the bomb hunters are breaking
bad for the game
yeah yeah they they keep on reconfirming
the blame
so i'm sure there's people listening
if you feel some resistance when i say
this
that means that you know you probably
have to reconsider why you're playing
tougher games right you don't have
anything to prove you don't have to
prove that because you beat a tougher
game that you're smarter or something
yeah that's just
just just them in my opinion just like
you've got a
it's a good time to involve uh
mindset
carmichael if you want to prove you're
very good just like open the gto trainer
and try not to make any mistakes against
the bot like
that that's very motivating man the the
gto bot [ __ ] destroyed me i i
i go to my living room like wow am i
really that bad in poker really after
all these years
yeah
it's tough
it's a [ __ ] calling station as well
right you know you try to love him and
he just calls all the time it's just now
the best thing is when you make a bluff
and it says uh-huh and then he folds a
better hand i'm like
but you pulled a better head you idiot
then he telling me to make a mistake but
i make a perfect play he folds a good
hand i'm like yeah you see that's
exactly what i was trying to do and now
you're telling me that i was wrong not
buying it
we talked a little bit again the same
concept came back uh
what do you think why do you think
people
get so much satisfaction out of beating
tougher games and why do they then
cannot say like oh i will go play
software games instead
ego simple as the ego likes to say
i'd be the toughest games i'm smart i'm
good look at me and the ego yeah can
create a validation around the heart of
the games the better the harder i hate
the work and when you see the people
taking the easy route you can like you
said earlier send your moral high horse
and go you're making lots of money over
there but you're boom hunting you're
playing soft games i'm playing the real
games i'm i'm a real grinder here i'm
grinding in the streets every day low
win rape and i'm playing the best guys
there's an element of
yeah i think i'm smart by doing that the
ego gets a validation around that so i i
think it's just being sensible if you're
one of the players listening to this
like i said if right like right i said
if you feel resistance or you're
triggered it's probably you might have
ended up in this scenario
like inadvertently like some players
they'll just play one side i know i did
for most of my career played one side
and you end up progressing progress and
progressing you end up in a player pool
that's really tough and you don't want
to look around you don't zoom out and go
wait a second maybe this is not the best
use of my time and you're very
one-dimensional and what you'll find
with a lot of high-stakes guys and guys
who have had long careers they've been
more adaptable they've been more
flexible they've spent time looking
around for better opportunities so if
you are one of those guys playing a
really tough player pool
one assess your ego and go right am i
doing it for the right reasons but also
spend some time looking around is the
better opportunities like right i said
it's fine if you're a guy who loves a
challenge you wake up in the morning
like let's get the hardest table i can
get in the world let's play some good
guys your lineus live with the world
think fair enough great that's that's
awesome but if that's not the case
you're trying to make money and a lot of
money in your career then yeah maybe
zooming out dropping the ego and looking
for better opportunities at least part
of your time part of your grinding hours
would be beneficial
yeah couldn't agree more all right so i
want to bring the conversation to some
character traits that have been helpful
for you so i know you thought about
having almost like strong values from
your parents talking about basically
took you to school to take your training
create a very good volume system for you
and you've obviously had a lot of
experiences you had your swimming career
you did uh
engineering at university you played
computer games see i want to have a
little conversation around some of the
character traits that you've developed
either before poker or through poker
that have allowed you to have a long and
successful career
being good with a computer is
very important in poker
um like to use
proper software and stuff i think that's
a
an underrated skill i guess
uh
like knowing how to navigate in solvers
and stuff
is very like helpful
understanding
the requirements for using the software
as well i think that was
up to
one two years ago was uh
i think like people couldn't use
properly
the servers because they don't know the
technical aspects of building a computer
and stuff i think that's very helpful
i think at this point it pretty much i
feel like i've talked about like most of
my convictions i guess i don't know if i
tried to think of others
no they could yeah and i remember from
when you talked about sports they talk
about learning skills and when you're
talking about studying in particular
like you approach that like kind of like
uh athlete training where you'll learn a
skill and you'll apply that that skill
for a period of time i think that's a
really good character trait where yeah
this kind of learning application model
where rather than just condense like
loads of knowledge getting it taken in
like i said a lot of sports we just
we find tuned skills we fine tune in
attributes uh through practice sounds
like a character trait that you've
definitely picked up i think resilience
and the ability to change perspective a
good character traits of yours you talk
about like taking breaks which i think
it's a it's an overrated skill and the
underrated sales already a lot of
players don't know how to take breaks
and reset their perspective in order to
keep going i think you've shed a lot of
your your kind of resilience and your
ability to uh keep going when things
have gone badly actually one thing i
want to say about gravity i've wrote a
note we're talking about downswings and
renee talked about with the downswing he
looks for opportunities so how can i
take this downswing better than other
people you've never expanded on how you
deal with downswing so when you're when
you're
downswing a challenging part of your
career how do you deal with downswing
rather than taking breaks i know taking
breaks with one of them what are some of
the things that you do to approach a
downswing from a positive perspective
yeah like
um
i feel one of one of the aspects
one of the things that i probably do
well
and i've done it throughout my career i
tried
not to [ __ ] myself like
oh i'm earning a lot of money right now
just
that doesn't mean i'm going to keep
learning and if i'm doing that
like
doesn't mean i'm going to keep losing
so i feel like
the process
of
how you approach the game
it should be fairly the same when you're
winning or when you're losing it doesn't
it doesn't matter like
if i'm losing a lot and i
the set of
technical
data that i
feel that i i judge that are most
important
i'm doing bad
it doesn't make me very happy you know
if i'm
like running
like
above my
my yellow line and
uh
running very hard and
and my ev is should be low and it's high
if i'm losing a lot in the higher
buyings and losing in the smaller
buyings i would be
you know so i don't try to like
go inside this fantasy or
in an upswing i'm i'm i'm losing a lot
i'm winning a lot and that's all that
matters that doesn't get me happy
and the opposite
is it
holds true
when i'm on a downswing as well so like
i think
um
you got to have something to hold on
when you when you're on a downstream you
have to
you need to have a set of things
that you are doing
that you
consider that are the most important
things you know so like
if you have a
if you're on a down screen you're
studying
x amount of time you're doing okay if
your ev is okay
then you're doing great you need to have
a set of things
that are
tangible and that are in arm's length
that you can make through
when you're downstream in order to be
successful in order to be happy when
you're
when you're running bad otherwise
poker will always
feel like
you have no control
and
you have
like no power or
should
like no decision in what's going to
happen in the future if you don't have
this set of targets
that are reachable in the short or mid
term
so i think that's
a must have
skills like in order to survive and that
doesn't apply to poker as well like it
applies basically everything
i think
um
there was
you know this this girl um
i remember her name she wrote a book on
poker i listened to this podcast is uh
preeconomics uh she was yeah
and she says that
she feels like
academical
success is
more variance than poker success and i
think that's
curious like because you need to have
the same
set of
traits you know that you need in poker
in order to have success in in life
because life is also random
and
it feels like you don't have any
any control about what's happened you
know so you need to have
either on in your relationships or if
you're opening a business
for me like opening a business is one of
the riskiest things ever you don't know
what's gonna happen you don't know
like you see the pandemic like even if
you're the best in the world if you open
the restaurant three years ago you would
be dead like there's nothing you can do
so you need to have some like
some small self that you
you know you feel good like you have to
have this set of things that you do
that makes you feel good
otherwise
everything is going to be bad in your
life
literally there's no part of your life
that you can have full control
that you don't need to set these small
targets around it virtual success
this podcast is brought to you by poker
ambition where me and adam have created
our coaching program the mechanics of
poker after having reached high sex
poker ourselves we tested out this
philosophy on our cfp students which saw
them rise through the ranks and doubled
their win rate we then took the best
knowledge of that cfp program and turn
it into the mechanics of poker so you
can have that high quality content
without the long-term commitment and
often hefty price that comes with a cfp
program now i will be teaching you the
technical side of how poker really works
how to think about the game and how to
consistently get better and adam focuses
on the mindset and performance skills
you need to know in order to convert all
that technical poker knowledge into more
consistent profits at the table now this
program is high level it's made for
professional poker players who have the
ambition to break free from mid stakes
and move up to high stakes poker so if
you're ambitious about your poker goals
go over to pokerambition.com
for more information and there you can
also find a free one hour demo of
everything that is inside the program if
you have any further questions don't
hesitate to reach out but without
further ado let's get back to more
goodness in this episode
yeah i think it's a really important
lesson that poker teaches you and like
you said it's i like what you said at
the start don't [ __ ] myself and
realizing like results don't reflect how
you're actually performing and if you
let yourself get too high when things
are going well or let yourself get to
law when things are going badly you're
getting dragged around and we all know
pogba and life is going to be this
emotional roller coaster if we're
linking our internal state to our
results so you said we've got to create
almost a foundation of things that we do
control in an uncontrollable world how
do you show up on a day-to-day basis
what's the criteria of a winning day for
you that you control even if you're
losing day of the day of the day if
you're showing up in a certain way
that's meaningful for you that can still
be winning over the long term you know
like you said i think hold on to
something like an anchor that we hold on
to during tough times and also during
good times i like i like the way you
phrase that during a good time as well
once i drop in that expectation dropping
that ego realizing okay having a great
run right now probably ran good it's
like i'm too carried away i think it's
equally important as the inverse skill
when you're working with down swings in
tough times but yeah think of something
to take a life lesson as well like you
said everything we do has a lot of
unpredictability around it and getting
more involved in the process and linking
your internal happiness and state to the
things that you're doing the process of
getting there rather than the results
that come from it is way more important
long term and i think as a poker player
it's a skill you've got to learn like
off to the hardware i know renee you
learn the hardware i learned the hard
way yeah
we get so attached to results because
results of the metric that mean i'm good
at this game and if i'm good at this
game my life's good so we struggle at
first to create that separation between
the process and the results becomes one
mage once you get good at that process
you're like oh wait a second me showing
up in this ways all that really matters
the results will take care of themselves
i can just weather the storms and get
through it so as long as periods i'll
get to where i need to be eventually you
know that reminds me when you were
seeing players who wanted to play like
100k and l within a year those are the
type of guys they're just rushing trying
to get somewhere they're trying to uh
create this external metric of
validation and as a result they're
losing track of the process what's your
process for getting there how how are
you going to show up in a way that
guarantees you can get there you can't
so the four's on the wrong metric and
yeah i think it's a interesting thing to
remind yourself to to always create a
foundation of things you're doing i know
when i work with players who are
deep in a downswing and they're
struggling life is almost hopeless i
always get them to like double down on
winning their days if you can win your
day like morning even just win your
morning when half your day you create
some momentum that i'm in control of
these things and i can take action on
these things that allow me to to feel
like a winner and very often it comes
down to an internal state there's no
objective metric there's no one guy
sitting on a big
big mountain somewhere going that's the
winning day the winner he's the loser
it's all subjective some players similar
billionaires and probably feel like
they're not winning life other people
are scraping by but they're happy with
what's going on so we create the
scorecard so if we create the scorecard
we need to create our own winning day
formula which is controllable variables
mainly controller variables to uh yeah
create that kind of solidity going
forward
yeah yeah
all right so question i wanted to ask
you is if you could look back on your
poker career and get a reflect on one
lesson that poker in particular has
taught you either the hard way or the
easy way what would that one lesson be
you you say in an aim poker or
a lesson that poker has taught you could
be for a life lesson or it could be a
pork lesson
a life lesson would be good if you've
got one that comes to mind
i think
the most important concept
in poker
that you can
extrapolate to your life
is the concept which we were talking
about before is the
i think the ev component of things
i think we live in a world and our brain
is made in this way where we are
supposed to be results oriented
because otherwise you wouldn't survive
in the jungle or something so like
for example if someone ate
the red berry and died
you wouldn't eat red berry there's no
way to prove that it wasn't gonna kill
you
so you had you like back then you needed
to be resolution oh if you go that way
there's a lion there so you're gonna die
and i see that
our society still today is
mostly results oriented
you know
like all that matters are results
and if you don't have good results then
you're not gonna do you're not gonna be
respected you're not gonna be gonna feel
good about yourself so we live in a
society that mirrors
our
primordial brain which is
completely results oriented so i think
when you study poker and you discover
that
there is no fairness
do anything you know so i think the
concept of expected value
might be the most important thing that
occurred teaches us because
you when you understand that
like your whole
world perspective changes
because you see that
you're not gonna adore
the people who are
doing awesome you're not gonna
like
cheat on people who are doing bad
because
many things are not
in our control
and that's okay
you know
makes you a humble humbler person
and i think a happier person
overall and i think that's the
that's it about poker and why i think
it's a beautiful
beautiful game i think i think
i think they should teach
variance and ev on the high school or
something
i think this our society would be much
better like on average
yeah
yeah like i said we live in a culture
that almost like promotes us to think
very results-oriented whereas ev gets
you to think in terms of probabilities
and possibilities and nothing's 100 ever
in anything and we need to think like
when outcomes come come certain ways
what was the probability of the opposite
outcome like you said we have a very
confirmation by a society we promote all
the winners who were like yes well done
you did all that reckless stuff and got
at the top you ran really good but we
don't see it that way we see that ah
they're the role models in reality it's
like there's a lot of factors going on
and yeah i think once you learn to think
in eb you can't switch it off i mean
other people don't think in terms of av
you're almost like ah you're you can't
even you can't even think of their their
framing because they saw all or nothing
with like they say covert strikes
they're like ah i knew this was gonna
happen i knew something was gonna happen
you're like did you really know all
these factors were gonna play out in
this way and now you've got the
hindsight bias that you can look back
but um yeah i think it's really good to
train that skill set of expected value
there's actually a good book called
thinking in bets by annie duke former
poker player and she goes into this
concept i think poker players learn this
skill on the fly with with pogba but we
all want one to go deeper into uh how to
think in terms of ev in life she does a
good job of
extrapolating that concept to many life
situations
cool all right ready you've got any any
future any point questions that you want
to take
um
most first of all great answers okay
we're going to agree more actually we we
i think it was
what clanty that also said the most
important thing he uh that that poker
taught him was thinking in evie
i've heard this answer before you you
you clanty
uh luke johnson
no yeah i say sketch game player he was
also on i think episode seven eight
correct me if i'm wrong but we asked him
the same question he also said thinking
in eevee
so
it's uh
i think also if people ask me that
question i would also probably come down
to that recognizing variance and like
understanding that yeah okay this was
quite unlucky to happen yeah okay and
then people freak out about the weirdest
[ __ ] i'm like yeah it can happen you
know
the
there was there was room for a little
bit of variance i thought it was funny
yeah especially when someone ate a
either eats a red berry and he dies it's
not like you're going to be like yeah
probably variance let me try you're
right you're not trying
you're not gonna try again you're like
okay
bread berry don't eat very result
oriented but you're not going to be like
ah probably a five percent chance of
happening you just got unlucky no it's
just a stamp don't eat the wrapper
don't need the red berries
i don't know
a cat before something
i wanted to talk a little bit about
going forward uh
you you became poker player of the year
you had that great scoop
what are your uh
you don't like to think in long-term
growth so what's the next objective in
your poker career i mean you're doing
quite well in amassing uh messing all
the chips all the money
you're just gonna continue amassing more
or
do you have some some goals some
objectives that you're working towards
yeah i think i need to
um
solidify myself in the lives
scene
uh i'll be traveling a lot in the future
to play
live tournaments
and
that is
a separate challenge i guess
it's a
different lifestyle for me as well
so
i need to
merge that with my current life
and
in order to succeed i guess i was a very
good live player
10 years ago
i'm working on it
right now
because it's kind of a different game um
when you say working on it
what what do you mean you're working on
your live game how does how does uh
pedro work on his live game
yeah there are some
uh
some content out there right uh tell
stuff
trying to wrap my round my head around
whether there's
any validity
in studying like behavior
of people like while playing live poker
and uh
i've been progressing on that like i
played
two
live events like prague and
monte carlo so i'm going to barcelona
maybe vegas
and then
london and prague again i guess till the
end of the year
so it's
it's been i've been progressing but it
feels
it's still different for me to play live
than online
uh
what are some things that you're
struggling with
mostly the routine
i think it's way more exhausting to play
live like
you get there it's a different time zone
takes you three four days of settling
you play
like 12 hours
sleep bad
um wake up and you have to play at noon
again
and that's for 10 days and you get you
go back to yourself said
i think that's
my main struggle with live poker is the
the quality of life that
it's just
it's a trade-off you know it's much i
think it's much
healthier for me to stay in my house
but in order to progress and meet other
girls and to move up mistakes as well
you need to go to lifeburger there's no
there's nowhere else it's another
achievement i must first pursue i guess
you you said you were studying a little
bit of uh
of life tales to see if there's any
merits or
ads you can gain in like behavior at the
tables you've noticed and all the way in
the beginning of your career you said ah
i learned about ranges and i went to the
casino and it's like oh range range is
it not similar if you go to the live
tables and you picked up on some things
that you're looking for and you suddenly
see it you're like oh i see it
it's like oh wow
cool there are there are some things
but the the the tough thing about life
is getting feedback you know
on it like
i don't know you're gonna use a tell to
to like take an action
how are you gonna get feedback on that
action like you're gonna try that i know
10 times in one year or something
if six go right and far go wrong
does it mean it works
doesn't it i mean but that you were
referring to uh to to to to this tells
course i remember they ran variance or
at least they they they studied a lot
right
yeah yeah
to make sure that this big sample size
and i i watched a couple of things as
well and he was really talking about
natural behavior oh uh you know
white open posture close posture when do
you feel the natural need to
to hide when do you feel relaxed and
that said something about your hand i
remember i didn't go much to it but i
thought it was very interesting and if
you just understand natural behavior it
makes a lot of sense right it's it's
actually just like studying theory you
need to know kind of the baseline okay
why why do we do certain things and from
there you can
gain information the only thing then if
you're playing right you have a certain
decision making how you go through hands
if you notice then when you play life
and suddenly your life talk comes in
you're like wait in my thought process
where does this tale come in right
how do i value it compared to
you know i have the best blockers in the
world but this guy
gave this tale
where do i rank this yeah the i think
this is the this is the most difficult
thing about live playing for me is just
uh
there are many
environmental things that go that happen
that they go into my thought process and
many times they make me
like take a bad decision for example
us
stuff that happened all the time like
for example i was playing against
uh john pierre
nasa
uh in an early game of a 25k or
something in monte carlo
i thought everyone at the table had the
same stack
but
he actually had 30 000 chips less
so
i just i forbade a jax on the cuff cut
off against him
and
i looked at his stack and i for bed for
half a stack or something
i didn't know that he had less chips
than me so like
you know
and and he would be like oh
did he not know that i
did i i had nothing because i didn't ask
so he had to like take that thing into
consideration as well so there was not
all these environmental things that
happen like
um
sometimes you have to
the guy like three bets you and you have
to check
whether he
how many blinds he has it's not showing
up in the screen
it's not you don't know if
how close to the bubble it is how many
shard stacks there are or
a lot of other things that you have to
take into consideration and sometimes
something very
crazy happens and you have to adjust for
example you're thinking about blockers
and the guy acts out of hand
and you'll be like
okay
now
[Laughter]
um
like many things gonna happen and i
think that's
uh
i'm the kind of guy once who
if i'm
driving and i need to do uh
how do you say uh when you park
uh
parliament
yeah when you do a parallel parking if i
keep missing
i get very
uh
um
ashamed
and i live
like many times while i play poker i
feel ashamed because i'm taking too long
when i see her or something and like all
the eyes are on me and like oh [ __ ] i'm
just gonna do anything
but all these kinds of
uh
you know things that happen while we're
playing live and i feel like
uh
like i obviously obviously i trust my
whole
game while playing but i feel like there
are people that are way more experienced
than me a live broker even though
they might have a
uh like a poorer strategy than me but
they've been playing live poker for 10
15 years old obviously they have more
experience than me
and obviously
it takes less of a toll on them than it
does on me
on playing these events
i also think that
sometimes i think online players they
kind of overrate
their skill level compared to for
example let's say i go now play live in
vegas cash games
i'm sure that my theoretical knowledge
of the game could be stronger than a
regular dare for example but he knows
he has a good view of what's going on at
the live table he has a good feel of
what people do my reads and the
population are from online i don't know
how much they will translate obviously
certain things are just like psychology
how does a human constructor range and
stuff but i would probably give the guy
an advantage because he is first of all
he's familiar he feels very comfortable
in this environment so he will play his
a-game more often right it's what you
said i'm i i get a bit frustrated with
myself because i threw in the wrong chip
or i miscounted the pot you know all
things that i've had yeah yeah to be
many times
so
yeah
but on the other side the only way you
can get better at this is by
by playing right so do you then i think
it's always very important that before i
play i kind of say okay yeah i'm gonna
try live i will screw up and that's okay
do you do you consciously
say something like that or something
before you go play
so it doesn't yeah as much
yeah
obviously
i need to do that more i have some
entitlement because i was such a good
player that i
feels bad that i kind of suck right now
the
that um
but yeah
everything is like that like
when you're trying something new you're
moving up to stakes
if you're not if you're not able to make
make mistakes and forgive yourself
it's going to be very painful
for everything yeah
i think empathy is a very good skill to
have as a poker player i think sometimes
people are way too hard on themselves
and only beat themselves up for
yeah for no reason
in the beginning i think we talked about
we are all humans right and yeah what do
you expect you go play live poker you
you don't never play live poker yeah
it's gonna happen
i think i think this
is one of the things that i struggled
the most like as a poker player i
i
don't
tolerate mistakes as much you know i
think i'm much better
right now than i was
but it would it would like
[ __ ] my sleep
um just thinking of our hands at night
i think it's it can be a blessing and
and
and not as well like obviously you need
to
remember
when you made mistakes and correct them
but not to the point that you're not
sleeping over it so
i think yeah empathy is something
very great to have as a poker player as
a human being you're gonna make mistakes
you have to take risks and if you don't
forgive yourself afterwards
then you're just gonna be screwed
i think a very important part in that is
being very being realistic to what your
current skill set is
and you can beat yourself up over a
mistake that you clearly should not have
been making
but i think people beat themselves up
over mistakes they think they shouldn't
have been making but compared to it was
actually quite expected right if you go
play live and i make mistakes with chips
that's quite expected but some people
were like no i shouldn't be doing that
but you have no sample that shows that
that's an actual skill that you have so
the problem becomes when you're beating
yourself up over mistakes
that for example if i make a mistake
that is a normal mistake in my b game i
kind of beat myself up over that it's a
big mistake right okay yeah i didn't
play my a game now if i didn't do
certain things that prevented me from
playing my a game right if i was dumb
and partied until last night had way too
much to drink only had four hours of
sleep and then when to play i can i can
probably reflect on that like maybe next
time i should prepare better but then
when the mistake actually happens it's
within the line of expectation given the
way i prepared for my session right
yeah
great
very thought out process
uh
is there anything that
you would like to share with the
listeners before uh before we are
closing this off
yeah i think i've covered pretty much
all the things that i
that i believe
and
that i think are good but like
if i can
like have some
recommendations for everybody
uh
poker players non-poker players
go to a therapist
i think um
i've been going to like to
a therapist the past three four years
now
and
[Music]
there's no
he's not gonna like tell me hey
now you're healthy leave wait there's no
i don't know the word in english for
when you
get better in the hospital and
they send you out home because you're
healthy what's an inferno it's a
they release you i guess yeah
they fire you do they go out like that
no no they'll fire it out of the
hospital
they release you or something there's no
release in therapy i mean you always
have something to work on
and
[Music]
i think that translates you to poker
as well like
it
should be great to have like someone i
know it can be expensive to hire like a
mental culture or something that's
important
in many levels
but like i think therapy helped me
to like deal with
other many issues of my life
and
i think it's just
made me feel
happier and more caring towards myself
and the others
empathy is a skill that is
one of the greatest skills in the world
i guess
it will make you more humble and more
forgiving
and ultimately happier in the end
um
other than that
for
people who are poker players
just keep it up
follow the process
and
have fun i think you need to have fun
doing the stuff you do in your life
otherwise
it's gonna be
a bumpy ride
not a very good one
i think the empathy part that you
touched on i think you
can
only be more empathetic towards yourself
if you understand yourself i think
therapy really helps you
understand yourself at a better level it
was funny actually i i i wanted to say
uh something earlier in the conversation
but we didn't get to it but
when i went uh because i i fully i fully
agree i think everyone should see a
therapist i think the world the word
therapist there is a bit of a bad stigma
they call that around it uh i just see
it as like essential life coaching
basically in school
yeah you should basically
have a talk with a therapist once a week
you know just to
because if you then understand yourself
you can be more forgiving because you
understand that certain actions that you
take are based on certain experiences
that you had that were outside of your
control and you're beating yourself up
over that while i don't know certain
conditionings were installed due to the
environment that you grew up in and you
had no control over the environment you
grew up in so is it really fair that
you're going to beat yourself up over
that and when you realize what are some
root causes of certain thoughts that you
keep on having or certain behaviors that
you're showing
you can be more empathetic towards
yourself uh what i wanted to come back
to is when i uh if i the last couple of
therapies that i had and we are i was
talking a little bit about especially
around poker and i was explaining her
some some situations i was dealing with
and she every time came back to that i'm
human right and that's something that we
also said yeah okay renee you're
referring to some poker players but
they're not human anymore i don't know
if that's if that should be your goal
that you feel nothing like that
you're human and that's perfectly okay
all the things that you're saying it's
normally stressing you out i'm like oh
actually good point i never really
thought about that i was like yeah but i
shouldn't be stressed out but that
sounds like and in general you know
poker can be a high stressful
environment he says it's completely
normal and when i realized that like oh
i'm human yeah actually good point like
then from now on i can have more empathy
towards myself like hey this sucks
uh you know
it doesn't give you an extra it doesn't
it doesn't give you an excuse to be like
uh
a gofu spyro into it oh i thought oh my
life is so poor blah blah blah you take
a full victim mentality that's not the
goal here but the goal is to to to be
like okay i'm a human i experienced this
okay this sucks but i'm still gonna try
to make something better out of it
taking in consideration the fact that
i'm human also it helps you be a bit
more nicer to the fact that you
sometimes will play your b game your c
game sometimes miscounted the chips you
know when you have pocket jacks yeah
that happens
what happens
is it's just
uh is it is there like uh for example
that the fact that i'm human
uh that was sort of my main takeaway i
mean there were multiple takeaways but
there was one takeaway that uh that i
can share with the audience is there
maybe a takeaway because you said it was
super important
that
like a breakthrough you had in therapy
that really changed the way
you approached poker or life that really
increase the quality of your life that
you think listeners can associate with
yeah for sure like i think
one of the
one of the things about poker that
draws
us draw a smoker is
and draw some specific types of
personality towards broker
it's like you can make your living by
yourself
in your
home that attracts a lot of people that
have um troubles socializing
sharing feelings and being vulnerable
around people
and
i think allowing you to be more
vulnerable in your life is
one of the most important things
in the world it's gonna make you feel
better with yourself in your
relationships
and i think that's something that is
very
not talk about not talk about talked
about in
the scene
for example if you don't have
someone
to
talk up like talk to when you're
experiencing shitty things or when
you're experiencing good things
that's a huge problem and sometimes
being vulnerable to people is
makes you feel helpless you know makes
you feel like oh no oh you're going to
through a bad face oh yeah it's
everything is good
and when deep inside you you need to
like
to reach out to people and be like man
i'm feeling like [ __ ] like this really
sucks i don't think i'm gonna make it
i'm not sleeping you need to share stuff
with people and that's a very good
quality that like
a very good thing that therapy should be
like
you're never gonna do anything in your
life if you shut down inside yourself
and then share it with others i think
this is
it's okay to go to someone ask for a hug
ask for a kiss
and say you're bad
it's like it's part of being a human
being
yeah i couldn't agree more very
very good piece of advice and also if
you don't do that i think people will
get into the behavior that we talked
about as well that they will just you
know you're not feeling okay you're
gonna then work your ass off to try to
get out of that situation and it's not
gonna make you any happier or likelier
that you actually get out of the
situation
yeah and we as men we suffer
more
from that because we need to be strong
and we need to be the bastian and the
vanguard of family so like many people
would be like
like i'll talk about feelings not about
talk about
my
fears i have
and that's just gonna make you like
unhappy
and
it's gonna
take people away from you actually
you're not gonna draw anyone closer
being
a close person
yeah i remember i had to learn that as
well in my relationship to be more to
share more things to be more vulnerable
unconsciously you know like you said
because i'm a man i had certain
conditions thinking around how it's how
you're supposed to be a man so yeah you
don't show your vulnerable side to
your in my case my wife uh but in order
to make
deeper connections you have to also show
vulnerability right yes so that i would
say also really has helped me in my
relationship
adam you do do you have anything any any
experiences
similar that you think the audience can
learn from
and otherwise do you have any final
questions for pedro before we let him go
i think as poker players most players
can relate to uh shutting off emotions
to some degree like as poor players we
pride ourselves on being rational
thinkers and we live in the minds and
experience emotions all in the hot it's
all like a oh this fluffy little icky
stuff that we don't like and we'd rather
be all sensible and smart and live in
our minds and we try to push motions
away to a point where it's like wait a
second i need to be able to express
emotion i need to be able to feel
emotion exactly what pedro says it's
quite vulnerable it's really vulnerable
actually to express emotions negative
ones how you're feeling when you're down
to the people it's much easier to push
that emotion away and go to the mind and
rationalize or keep yourself busy or do
something that doesn't allow you to
process a deal with that emotion but
then you end up a shut-off person who
can't connect with people who can't have
the highs of life and you end up being
basically a bit of a robotic person
who's unable to experience the highs
under laws which is the worst scenario
so yeah like to bring this conversation
full circle embrace your humanness
embrace the emotions that come up and
you've got to go to the places that
scare you sometimes and be able to go to
those yeah vulnerable emotions and
experience them all the good news is
poca's like a really really good
training ground because many emotions
come up on a daily basis and if you
choose to
deal with emotions as they come up you
can do a lot of work as a poker player
dealing with emotional issues if you
have a therapist on the side who can
relate some of your experiences and
what's coming up in the context of poker
back to other experiences in your life
all of a sudden you've got a really good
training ground to work for those things
on the other side yes you might be more
successful
but hands down you're going to be
happier you're going to be a more
given person empathetic towards yourself
but also a more happy person towards
other people because you can share life
experiences with people so yeah i think
that you guys covered it all the topics
got covered really by you guys and yeah
that just kind of rounds it rounds it
all off and yeah i've got some further
questions but i'm going to actually
leave them because we'll be number three
hours i want to respect pedro's time an
amazing guest
thank you and yeah ready i'll leave it
up to you to do the usual closing
yeah i wanna i wanna thank everyone
especially pedro i mean it's been a
great conversation uh like i said we
hadn't talked prior i was actually i
really liked that because it's always a
surprise what you get i did hear good
things about you and they weren't lying
man uh great conversation i'm sure our
audience loved it as well
yeah i'm very happy to have met you and
uh we've had this opportunity to have
this podcast with you
cool yeah it was a great honor very very
cool experience
to like
share my experiences my my thoughts with
you guys and to observe
i'm sorry but
everything that you guys also talked
about was great i really enjoyed it
right that was it for the conversation
we had with pedro let's go over some
main takeaways a lot of wisdom as always
adam could you manage to
pick out a couple of uh golden nuggets
from this
conversation i'll try my best there's a
long conversation three hours to pick
brew but yeah so many great uh lessons
and wisdom that came from today's guest
and yeah i think one of the main ones i
was getting throughout there was this
kind of long-term process he talked
about almost like learning skills and
applying that knowledge but also being
very present and not thinking too far
ahead he's somebody who's always just
building that next brick put pushing
that next step achieving that next
metric and he's not looking too far
ahead so last year he just got the the
play of the year on pogba fives and it
wasn't even a goal of his other players
would have said that as a big metric he
was just busy playing playing the next
tournament playing next series and
because his process was so good it's
unable to have a lot of success so
there's a good blend of a long term
process but being very present and
committed to the next thing that's in
front of you i really like this story
about um what you listening from
swimming like you say swimming coach
told him after a bad race nothing is
lost and that's a great motto and life
lesson that poker players can learn and
by nothing is lost it means you're
learning valuable skills on your way so
you're learning even during the dance
when you're learning how to handle
variants you'll learn how to build
resilience you're learning things about
yourself in that moment so when things
are going bad to remind yourself nothing
is lost it's all training it's all
practice it's all a process i'm going
through is a huge life lesson for poker
players then he talked about accepting
down swings and the way he does that is
he doesn't get too attached when things
are going good and he also doesn't let
himself get too down when things are
going badly by always committing to his
like fundamentals and he has almost like
things he does on a daily basis a
process he follows that allows him to uh
be like he's winning or doing moving
towards his goals so even on down swings
rather than getting too his ego attached
to results we talked a lot about the ego
and how very often we're trying to
validate ourselves with external
outcomes he he gets in touch with what
he's actually doing on a daily basis
that allows him to move towards his
goals and then finally i like tears
like the biggest success takeaway our
biggest thing life lessons learned from
polka was thinking in ev the ability to
think about life circumstances and your
poor career in terms of expected value
and i think that's it's such a great
skill because you think in terms of
probabilities and possibilities which is
the game of life and very often we we
think in terms of black and white 100
zero percent but everything's got
probabilities once you
train yourself through polka to think in
ebay it's something it's hard because
like even as a session you often win a
lot of money i lose a lot of money it
feels like oh [ __ ] like i've done good
or bad here but in reality the eevee of
that session was probably very different
to what the outcome was so
it takes like almost like daily rewiring
but once you train yourself to think in
a day it becomes like a great almost
like um
system to think through any life
decision so yeah those are the main ones
that i got how about yourself ready what
was the main things you wrote down
yeah especially lester points you you
talked about is really
going less with the biggs ups and downs
and poker right and he he also talked
about
um
he's really a realist and he doesn't
[ __ ] himself
and he sees reality as is and recognizes
like oh i got quite lucky here and
doesn't get off you know doesn't let his
ego take over like oh i'm the best now
and i can beat these higher games right
he was very much against uh shot taking
and he gave the example of kind of icm
implications on your bankroll that
basically
uh the impact of losing is greater than
the impact of winning right because if
you lose your role then it's over sort
of
right it's just like in a tournament
with icm so i thought that was uh that
was a really interesting one you in
details talked about the long-term
picture but mainly in again the risk
assessment he's very
risk aware
don't want to say he doesn't take risks
but he's very risk aware and takes yeah
it takes good opportunities when uh when
they arise
um
we also talked a little bit when i asked
him like good advice for like mid 6
players and he actually
didn't go too much about technical stuff
like we did talk about how important is
to study theory and mainly
if you understand what the correct
theory is we can learn how to exploit
better right that's definitely a
philosophy of his but he was talking
more about other things like
which sides to play on which tournaments
to actually play
uh so i thought that was very
interesting often we think about our win
rate as okay how can we improve our wind
rate yeah we should become
we should study this spot better but
there's so i think there's maybe like 50
ways to increase your win rate and only
one of them is for example to go through
the solver however
most of the people spend time in that
specific area
so yeah i thought it was interesting to
see that he definitely had awareness
around that area we also talked a little
bit about feelings are good
and i wrote down a point that you said
be more fluffy
so i really liked it that one as well we
talked a little bit about empathy
especially in terms of therapy if you
better understand where certain
behaviors of yourself come from that you
might
beat yourself up
over in the past but if you learn how
this behavior was installed of you by
certain conditionings by certain
environments you can then show more
empathy towards yourself and stop
beating yourself up and i think general
empathy is a very a good skill to have
so yeah thank you uh for everyone who
