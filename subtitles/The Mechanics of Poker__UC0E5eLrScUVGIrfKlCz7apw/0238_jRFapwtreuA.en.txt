what you have to put work in.

[01:10]
what you have to put work in.

[01:10]
what you have to put work in.
Yes. Uh I do either that or what I've

[01:14]
Yes. Uh I do either that or what I've

[01:14]
Yes. Uh I do either that or what I've
done. For example, we did a map with a

friend Kenny Hollard. Um we did a map of

what nodes impact the win rate and in in

[01:25]
what nodes impact the win rate and in in

[01:25]
what nodes impact the win rate and in in
in uh which fashion. So basically we had

[01:29]
in uh which fashion. So basically we had

[01:29]
in uh which fashion. So basically we had
three bet pots, PVB, single race pot,

[01:31]
three bet pots, PVB, single race pot,

[01:31]
three bet pots, PVB, single race pot,
you know, everything you can think of.

[01:33]
you know, everything you can think of.

[01:33]
you know, everything you can think of.
And then we took a big database and we

[01:36]
And then we took a big database and we

[01:36]
And then we took a big database and we
kind of looked, okay, three bet pots,

[01:39]
kind of looked, okay, three bet pots,

[01:39]
kind of looked, okay, three bet pots,
they involve that many big blind, you

[01:42]
they involve that many big blind, you

[01:42]
they involve that many big blind, you
know, over time. Uh BVB, that many big

[01:45]
know, over time. Uh BVB, that many big

[01:45]
know, over time. Uh BVB, that many big
blind on the flop, four like etc, etc.

[01:49]
blind on the flop, four like etc, etc.

[01:49]
blind on the flop, four like etc, etc.
Uh and then you cross that with the

[01:50]
Uh and then you cross that with the

[01:50]
Uh and then you cross that with the
frequency of the spots, right? Single

[01:52]
frequency of the spots, right? Single

[01:52]
frequency of the spots, right? Single
race spot, small putts, but very

[01:54]
race spot, small putts, but very

[01:54]
race spot, small putts, but very
frequent, blah blah blah. We crossed

[01:56]
frequent, blah blah blah. We crossed

[01:56]
frequent, blah blah blah. We crossed
everything and the answer was basically

[01:58]
everything and the answer was basically

[01:58]
everything and the answer was basically
how much does that node impact your win

[02:00]
how much does that node impact your win

[02:00]
how much does that node impact your win
rate? Is it a lot? Is it medium? Is it

[02:03]
rate? Is it a lot? Is it medium? Is it

[02:03]
rate? Is it a lot? Is it medium? Is it
not at all? Like I mentioned six big

[02:05]
not at all? Like I mentioned six big

[02:05]
not at all? Like I mentioned six big
pots. The pots are giant but it never

[02:06]
pots. The pots are giant but it never

[02:06]
pots. The pots are giant but it never
happens. So it doesn't impact your win

[02:08]
happens. So it doesn't impact your win

[02:08]
happens. So it doesn't impact your win
rate at all. Right? And so basically we

[02:10]
rate at all. Right? And so basically we

[02:10]
rate at all. Right? And so basically we
did that and then we just I just

[02:11]
did that and then we just I just

[02:12]
did that and then we just I just
prioritize. Okay, I'm just going to

[02:13]
prioritize. Okay, I'm just going to

[02:13]
prioritize. Okay, I'm just going to
tackle what impacts my win rate the

[02:16]
tackle what impacts my win rate the

[02:16]
tackle what impacts my win rate the
most. That's where I want to get really

[02:18]
most. That's where I want to get really

[02:18]
most. That's where I want to get really
good. Then I went second layer. What

[02:20]
good. Then I went second layer. What

[02:20]
good. Then I went second layer. What
impact the win rate the win rate like

[02:22]
impact the win rate the win rate like

[02:22]
impact the win rate the win rate like
you know in a medium fashion. Uh, and I

[02:25]
you know in a medium fashion. Uh, and I

[02:25]
you know in a medium fashion. Uh, and I
probably never got to the the small

[02:27]
