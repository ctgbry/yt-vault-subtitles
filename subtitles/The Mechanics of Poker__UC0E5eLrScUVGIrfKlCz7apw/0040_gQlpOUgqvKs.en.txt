hour demo
hey hey hey hey hey hey
yes guys get this party started
let's get this party started right now
limpop is not really uh
a spot where you're gonna do a lot of
over betting
that is mainly
because there's like a lot of random two
pairs in
the impositions range so here for
example you can have do 10 3 off suit
10-5 offsuit nine five offsuit nine
three off suits all hands that I don't
have and as soon as you start to apply a
lot of pressure to make it quite easy
for him to defend
here we go check race with the Queens is
it called
he checks
I think I'm gonna bet let's say as a
random flushrow I just want to deny like
some Equity we can get some value versus
worse over breasts like tens and Jacks
someone subscribe to everyone Mr J thank
you Mr tree
actually I was playing with Mr J earlier
right
make a little forward here with the Ice
King
hi that's uh
above average flop I would say
I started with a little ten percent
and he falls I actually got a call here
normally I don't really call but there's
a fun player in the big blind nice on
both tables I'm gonna call the three bet
here got a versions
but um
oh it's actually now someone actually
asked about that uh that hand the six
seven yeah like I said it was a mistake
by me should have went for a bigger
sizing
I also noticed that actually usually
when we're a little bit deeper uh I've
had actually a couple hands where we're
a little bit deeper let's say we start
the hand under 20 240 or something then
on the river kind of end up with a
little bit of a weird sizing
um
well I check all the nines you went
quite big so I'm gonna be doing a lot of
folding already with sixes still Deuces
not really sure about nines
man not not too thrilled about my hand
to be honest but
and I'll turn off the gravity is your
fault
I'm curious actually if it's very hard
to find hands to defend probably a
solver will just go frequency everything
because you could make an argument that
sixes is a better defend than nines but
you could also make an argument that
nice is a better defend than sixes so
it's it's a little bit of a weird spot
here I got to check down
with my Knights versus threes
there are three by the A's Queen
the guy dunks out
that uzbekistanian
Superstar it's a bit weird I call
checks
pretty sure what is better
not really sure what is better
I'm just gonna let him Bluff
the thing is like I cannot really check
and fold the river I think uh
due to
the very big random Factor
so I was considering for example betting
turn the benefit of betting turn is that
you will never get blocked on the river
but then I kind of already decided I
don't think I'm really folding the river
anyway so and it doesn't really matter
yes Korean nine Queen nine
okay I'm a genius
oh my God that's got to be the greatest
car in poker this is the Flop I'm
talking about guys this is the Flop I'm
talking about
actually gonna start off with a check in
general this is quite a bad board for me
we're a little bit deeper
I'm actually going to check again
my exact holding
river is interesting
it was very interesting
but for four and a five
this is gonna make a big bet I think you
will just snap call it off with Ace Jack
Ace Queen I was thinking about checking
again and then going for the race but
I was a little bit worried uh that he
might check behind a head like this
simply because it's very hard to get
caught and preview I think people could
be a little bit afraid of the track race
um
yeah that's why I decided
it's format
we are MP cutoff
okay calling
let's flop
mm-hmm
it's a little bats
I'm gonna call
a good turn
I'm gonna make a mini bet
and sometimes get caught by worse we can
get some hands to fold
foreign
but I don't think it happens all that
often in this spot
and then integrate
I think it should happen but I don't
think it happens all that often and now
safer it's going to prove me wrong God
damn it
yeah and now
ah
probably betting without Spade is better
to avoid getting in this spot
22 if our hand is good that is
22 percent if our Outlets are good so
then he needs to add like something
random
maybe I made it just a mistake by
betting and now I'm in this situation
with a spade or something I guess I have
to call it off but I'm not very happy
okay he has the nut flush uh if if he
does this with the nut flush I I don't
think I can call oh my God is this the
moment what's gonna happen Okay this
this sounds good this seems good an open
and a three bet this is a very
this is a good spot guys so pick up two
and a half three big blinds let's go
actually I prefer actually a call and a
Siva take it actually this is not a bad
flop to be honest
oh I want two 22 big blinds we need it
guys we're gonna go all the way with
this hand there's no way we're not gonna
get a shoulder with this hand because
we're too invested
oh
let me check Jam to turn actually quite
a good play
come on check and Showdown versus Ace
Queen we need this 44 big blind pop my
friend
we need the spot
we need this pot
check
oh he's thinking about it way too long
oh he's gonna bet
oh
[Music]
what does he say that he has
well I surely didn't want a bad fault
turn
buy Six Suited
we're two we're too deeply invested I
think he would have probably already bet
like some pairs on the turn
[Music]
where to invest it
we're too invested guys we're too
invested yeah
okay I'm gonna call it everybody with
the Ice Queen
I'm gonna call the flop
and if you face a barrel tossman to
defend I think Ace Queen
is usually like your better type of
holding to defend
um
we probably actually already have to do
like some some jamming here on the turn
whoever is king queen
okay guys something good happening I
like it we actually have a seven to
suited guys
okay let's go
I actually don't want him to fold I'm
actually gonna make a very small
I don't want him to fold
gonna go for a five big blind three but
he cannot fold yes we don't we don't
want to fold we want to play a big pot
just go
he four bets okay this is gonna be it
are we gonna win are we gonna win a lot
of money
let's flop something oh this is like the
most horrible flop ever
the more horrible flop ever
we cannot even continue versus bad God
damn it
oh he checks
okay there's hope
now we have to
hit the bear
oh my God
be good check again
we checks again we have the best hand
I think so right
I'm gonna make a little bet
oh guys we need to win this spot we need
to win this goddamn pot Charlie where
you at boy I am lucky lucky what are you
thinking about man don't dunk okay
oh I really hope we win this one
amazing amazing let's go let's go let's
go pajamas it's a pajama yeah yeah
pajamas uh my birthday gift from is this
gonna be a miracle turn around guys
is this gonna be a miracle turn around
let me see what the status is
man we played them we played that head
like a [ __ ]
[ __ ] that has to be said guys
God damn it I got all my hopes up for
nothing we're still down quite a lot
minus
26 so we have to now win a pot of 26 big
blinds somehow
I was just so excited that I didn't even
look at the table
this is what happened guys
so we made a very small three bet
because we didn't want to take down the
pot okay
he forbid we called plot one check check
turn into seven so I decided to squeeze
out a little bit
actually I didn't really I actually
thought we were closer because we also
want that other pot with the seven dude
so actually I thought we were doing
quite good now
but apparently we didn't if I knew that
I would have maybe squeezed out another
bed on the river and on the other spot
here
the guy jumps
[ __ ]
yeah
I feel like this hand is probably a call
some of the time
but I'm not very happy about it
he has Ace Queen okay GG
things if you look here at the hands
that I have here obviously a set I'm
calling oh really but like a stand is
the worst call I've in my opinion than
Ace nine same with Ace Jack
uh same with ace four same with Ace 5
because I think uh likely end for him to
be battling our hands like King five
jack five these type of Holdings same
with the four so then basically yeah
you're left with hands like
an ace nine
an ace eight and a seven
so yeah yeah
