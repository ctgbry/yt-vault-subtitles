[00:00]
welcome back to another play and explain
we're going to be playing and explaining
that's why it's called a play and
explain two tables of 2L Zoom we fired
up so without further Ado let's get
straight into the action going to defend
here with the Jack
10 and we flop okay to be honest

[00:18]
10 and we flop okay to be honest
definitely a hand that we're going to
continue with either by raising or
calling I think both options are
fine snap checks the turn I think I'm
going to be checking this one as

[00:31]
going to be checking this one as
well and definitely calling the
river here with the Queens I'll use a
big b check approach and I think then in
that approach I like checking top set if
you play a small bat it's usually B

[00:45]
you play a small bat it's usually B
small check turn if you play a big bet I
like flop checking a bit more maybe you
indu some uh some aggression little does
he know that we have top set now there's
actually going to be quite a lot of
shitty Rivers H should we maybe already
raised this on a turn and just try to

[01:00]
raised this on a turn and just try to
stack like two pair and stuff I don't
mind that actually it's a bit
greedy obviously he can have a straight
but first that hand we still have Equity
like obviously the downside of raising
is that he can call and there will be a

[01:16]
is that he can call and there will be a
lot of active shifting rivers that he
could maybe call dunk bat but let's say
he calls and dunk bats a flush he could
maybe have the other Mis flush
so but I think stacking sevens and eight
straight away before something bad rolls
off is slightly better let's see where

[01:32]
off is slightly better let's see where
has a combo draw and he just rips it in
that's also
fine cuz he was like well what do you
mean you check back the Flop you race
the turn you have nothing little does he
know we had a little trappy trappy

[01:56]
trappy if I had end like Jack 10 or
queen 10 I might consider checking this

[02:00]
queen 10 I might consider checking this
checking back this board but I think
like King 10 A10 are just a bit too good
but definitely not a board I should be
betting a lot with the 5x advantage that
he could have now here on the turn it's
a spot where I think on average
population bets these type of hands a
bit too much I'm actually going to check

[02:16]
bit too much I'm actually going to check
this
one and call the river but on average I
feel like people a general tendency that
people have and that you might have as
well is that on the turn if you have a

[02:30]
well is that on the turn if you have a
two Street hand like we have here that
you play it as b betat a bit too
often and easy call on the
river you know and have him do something
[ __ ] with the King eight but yeah I
think strengthening your checkback range

[02:46]
think strengthening your checkback range
there with two Street
hands
is important and something that most
players if you look at average
population Tendencies are doing wrong so
chances are you are doing that wrong as

[03:00]
chances are you are doing that wrong as
well here padus we could decide to PE
here with a recreational he also M Ray
so let's uh let's just call and see and
see what happens basically when people
MIM raise calling in a small blind
becomes interesting and the fact that
the big blind is also Recreation player
makes it extra interesting we could not

[03:16]
makes it extra interesting we could not
rep set you know we definitely have
sevens and fours we do unblock
everything I actually don't mind it
let's go for a check race let's see
where this hand goes guys obviously it's
probably not something that you should
be doing a
lot but we're playing in a vacuum

[03:31]
lot but we're playing in a vacuum
now like if we had five or something
that would probably be GTO
approved but since calling from the
small BL these positions is not really
like a default strategy or something I'm
only I was only adjusting because any
MIM R and officies in the big BL I think

[03:45]
MIM R and officies in the big BL I think
we can play The Spot in a vacuum in a
way you know we could definitely have a
queen off we could have fours we could
have sevens so I feel like a check
raising there in a vacuum is going to be
quite a good play and I think it's also
likely on average that people do a bit

[04:00]
likely on average that people do a bit
too much SE betting versus small gold
call so not theoretically approved
probably pocket deces there like I said
fives or sixes or something where you
can turn straight probably a bit better
but uh the plan was there to just YOLO
my
poetes 67 suited here we can do a little

[04:16]
poetes 67 suited here we can do a little
bit of everything I'm not really sure
who this guy is for a regular I don't
mind a forbat if it's not a
regular I don't like a forbat going to
go for the call here fives and sixes
definitely hands that will be in my
range and not so much in his this hand I
was something Tre bet call this time

[04:32]
was something Tre bet call this time
probably going to go for a check race
and
here going to go for

[04:45]
stepy very interesting turn feel like we
should probably continue betting

[05:25]
should have probably he should have
probably done something with his hand I
would say on flop or turn

[05:31]
this guy's now thinking about it it's
pretty bad run out
obviously I guess he's going to Bluff
like some ACE highs like Ace eight or
something also follow about for quite a
while
so may seem like this could be an over

[05:47]
so may seem like this could be an over
blush
spot no just out of flush I also like to
have the 10 with my hand bucking Ace 10
I feel like it's a spot where he would
definitely be tempted in turn turning
like A8 or something into a bluff feel

[06:01]
like A8 or something into a bluff feel
like that sizing is uh pretty sub
optimal through with the recreational
here I'm actually going to check this
one

[06:15]
back I like
that feel like he's stabbing here with
complete bananas like

[06:30]
complete bananas like
because 10 probably has something so I
don't mind going for the race
here could have 10 Jack with a diamond
king Jack with a diamond king 10 with a
diamond then Ace like it's very unlikely

[06:46]
diamond then Ace like it's very unlikely
for him to have complete garbage but
like check back there in
general both my hand and the texture is
not really great for barreling for
recreationals so I like to use an altern
ative line there with my low flash draws

[07:01]
ative line there with my low flash draws
also don't really want to get raised and
face a turn B etc etc you know we can
still Bluff him off
garbage on a later Street we never have
to fold I think I made my

[07:15]
point and a Razer pocket fives support
that's very good for me you should not
be doing too much SE betting here I
think pocket fives is the hand that
benefits the most from like little bit
of protection versus random to overcards
we can get some th value fors a four or

[07:31]
we can get some th value fors a four or
three maybe like some ACE Queen Ace King
that's going to call us turn three four
five yeah we almost have a straight if
we had a club I think we should
definitely bet now it's maybe a bit too
optimistic if we had like hand like 54
we could maybe

[07:45]
we could maybe
bet 65 I wouldn't hate betting 65
actually is a nice bet here on the turn
for big sizing like 2
e five club house I wouldn't have mind

[08:06]
yeah pocket
Jacks that's that's trouble it's
trouble trouble in Paradise 67 there by

[08:15]
trouble trouble in Paradise 67 there by
the way would also probably be a very
nice
Barrel for

[09:04]
he's a call again made a small lead like
not necessarily because the three
necessarily that great for me obviously
it does hit me sometimes

[09:15]
it does hit me sometimes
um this river is quite interesting in
terms of what we should
do going to go for check but I wouldn't
mind leading actually

[09:33]
it's kind of what you think he has more
of T Jacks queens or like some Bluffs
what the [ __ ] is

[09:46]
this but leading I think let's say you
had would we ever have king queen of
clubs or something I probably wouldn't
have but that would probably good good
lead very interesting hand I think on
the Rivery probably have to jam

[10:00]
the Rivery probably have to jam
I don't know what he's doing
but interesting hand and also depends
kind of how thing you think he's going

[10:15]
kind of how thing you think he's going
to go on the river if he's still going
to value that 10 Jacks Queens being like
listen you just always have a nine
always have a
nine but like our hand obviously is
strong enough to maybe throw out the
value B

[10:30]
value B
and there's definitely draws that we can
have that we bet called the turn that
now want to lead the
river we just lack I guess value because
we don't really River a king
Axe and we block a
nine yeah that's pretty sure

[11:03]
this hand actually could sometimes trout
like a little mergy check rat but I
think that's more true vers the button I
think first got if we just call

[11:44]
this guy pots now but half poot I think

[11:45]
this guy pots now but half poot I think
it's a recreational
player this is an interesting spot like
I'm very tempted to race however if the
river is a three and a a six a five a
king I'm a bit [ __ ] but it does really
seem like he has like a tiny over pair
in situations like this what I actually

[12:01]
in situations like this what I actually
like to do is call and Lead
River I'm still gonna do it
now I think he has like bucket a or
something very off and bucket knes or

[12:16]
something very off and bucket knes or
you could have a river
Ace I'm not really sure about sizing I'm
going to go for this one

[12:31]
I think we were forced to size down a
bit because of the way we range him yeah
he had an over pair or at least he had
he had an over on the Flop but it became
a third pair on the river yet bucket
Queens so I think a spot that I'm sure

[12:46]
Queens so I think a spot that I'm sure
many of you viewing feel like you've
been in
before and I think I gave you guys a
good
solution let's say the river is just
like a 10 or something I would have
definitely let

[13:03]
bigger
[Music]
here going to go this hand can do a
little bit of everything I feel like
with the heart spefic specifically I'm
going to go for an over

[13:15]
going to go for an over
but the hard version of my
hand turn is also very interesting this
one is all very interesting first Big B
feel like betting ranges on this board
is bit too strong strong the checking R

[13:30]
is bit too strong strong the checking R
is a bit too weak so I'm going to fold
here I'm going to go for a
barrel if I diamonds I would definitely
check do feel like we have some out of
fults obviously we don't really want
going to get want to get raised with
this hand so diamond is definitely never

[13:46]
this hand so diamond is definitely never
a
barrel and like Queen 10 is probably
another a barrel I think a river have to
give up without the
diamond he's just going to have a jack
way too often interesting spot as well
not really sure what my turn strategy

[14:01]
not really sure what my turn strategy
looks like there here I can either a
call I can three B I'm going to call two
Recreations here
behind it's definitely a spot where if
there's Recreations behind I'll I think
the EV of calling just goes

[14:17]
the EV of calling just goes
up so in general you want to just be a
little bit more
active and also EV of three batting in
general with Bluffs goes down because
these guys will just randomly vpip

[14:30]
I'm just going to start off with a small
bet here I think I think that's going to
be fine we have back to straight draws
even though my back to stra R is not
great
right exactly what exactly my point uh
it's that a great back to straight R I
think we have to

[14:48]
check and I think here I'm going to draw
a little risky
[Music]

[15:01]
do I want to do

[15:18]
here overb here with the six7 Spades I
think that's good he calls me with two
pair is eight yeah he's going to check
that a lot to me because he thinks I
have a lot of low pairs so I really like
my over but down the river here decid to

[15:31]
my over but down the river here decid to
barrel with the deuce specifically
unblocking like 68 56 stuff that he
might have I think it's just a good it's
a good blocker and
Unblocker I will sometimes get called by
like the King High flush draw and be

[15:46]
like the King High flush draw and be
good on the river this guy would be a
recreational I'm not really sure I would
call this but if we don't know I'll just
fault it's good spot to lead if he
doesn't do it then I'll do it

[16:18]
buddy pH a
raise and a call I think I'm just going
to fold drawing to only a gutter he
could have 78 they could actually both
have 78 so that's not great five for

[16:30]
have 78 so that's not great five for
sued my favorite hand for the people who
are
interested poker has become so boring
guys we all thinking equities and blah
blah everyone's favorite end oh my
favorite hands is aces no that that's
not the way it works guys you need to
pick you need to pick a pretty hand and

[16:45]
pick you need to pick a pretty hand and
that's your favorite hand given this is
my favorite hand you made it quite big
uh so probably it's a fault but or is fa
the majority of the time but hey since
my favorite hand it's good illustration
your favorite hand cost you money but
guys you need to pick five for suited my

[17:01]
guys you need to pick five for suited my
favorite
hand e check here with the pocket Jacks
in general blind first
blind deep stacked right we're playing

[17:16]
blind deep stacked right we're playing
cash game have to be a bit careful when
two cards below a seven are connected to
each other since this uh will give him a
lot of advantages he straight away goes
for a big

[17:30]
for a big
bet we have an easy call with Jax with a
spade but we're not
necessarily too thrilled
here he is pretty interesting I think I

[17:47]
here he is pretty interesting I think I
would have called the turn again it
would have been a bit loose but he
checks I think there's nothing else to
do but
check when he bet so big on the Flop if
he would have bet it small on flop like
1/3 I would have definitely TR a little

[18:01]
1/3 I would have definitely TR a little
bad myself because then he has way more
5x 6X 7x but with the two3 b in the Flop
he's basically repping a more polarized
range he bet so basically saying that he
has king queen queen Jack no we have two
Jacks that's already pretty good uh he

[18:16]
Jacks that's already pretty good uh he
can definitely have something along the
lines of seven eight or something so I'm
just going to call any if has a good
Queen good for him he has king queen
that's fine on the a he's he's probably
going to slow down quite a lot um but I
still have like a lot of these lower

[18:31]
still have like a lot of these lower
pairs in my range so let's say for
example if I had like pocket eights
there or um pocket nines or pocket
sevens these are that are probably going
to have to fold because they block a lot
of his 7 eight 89 79 all the type of

[18:50]
stuff so I think Jack's B unblocks all
the all these Bluffs and it blocks like
the value range which is going to be
Queen Jack king queen 56 off suit 200

[19:00]
Queen Jack king queen 56 off suit 200
200l Zoom to5 probably a fult but uh
we're not we didn't come here to fault
right that's
uh didn't come here to full Big B vers
button that's that that is the model

[19:15]
button that's that that is the model
goes for a big
bet interesting obviously the more the
more he does this type of stuff like if
you would play against this guy a lot
then obviously we should not be
expanding our calling rat with 56

[19:37]
what is the B
sizing probably want to be repping a
jack here I would

[19:49]
say guess I was going to say he could
have a four but a four I guess could
Barrel but since he could have a four
like I don't think let's say we have
Queen Jack King Jack a jack we cannot go

[20:00]
Queen Jack King Jack a jack we cannot go
too big because he could have a four and
he because turn had
connectivity he could also check some of
his Kings or
Queens so uh I kind of figured it was a
spot where we don't really want to Value

[20:15]
spot where we don't really want to Value
bet a
seven we mainly want to I think be value
betting this one can For Better Or call
go for the call this time

[20:31]
we may want to be valuating I think a
good Jack
there I can see some blocks making sense
as
well I like Jack nine for example
because he's going to have turned like
some 10x but I feel like he did think

[20:46]
some 10x but I feel like he did think
about it for a while on the turn so
maybe a bit less 10x

[21:05]
here this guy check backs now delays
turn half
but saying that he maybe has like a 10
or

[21:15]
or
something all right I'll give you
credit here I'm actually going to go for
a check
race I think that's pretty good so yeah
I think block
blocking there would have been also fine

[21:31]
blocking there would have been also fine
with the
56 56 suited looks a bit like 54 suited
so it's also sort of my favorite

[21:45]
hand too bad we are not deeper if we
were deeper I would have liked to see
myself check race this now I think we
can just call and see what develops
feel like he against a snap check oh

[22:01]
feel like he against a snap check oh
he's going to be so tense Jacks Queens
Kings
heavy I feel like jamming is probably a
good play but the flusher does Miss so
I'm a little bit concerned
but feel like just if he snap checks he
he has so little ASX I also feel like we

[22:17]
he has so little ASX I also feel like we
cannot really check call that's a bit
too yeah bit too optimistic but I'm a
little bit sure the flush draw did Breck
but if his range is like

[22:30]
maybe some some 7x or 8X you know that's
already better than my hand sometimes
air that's going to Bluff me if I check
I'm don't think I can really call uh and
then if he has a bunch of nines tens
Jacks Queens Kings he's going to have to
call a very big proportion of them in

[22:47]
call a very big proportion of them in
order for my bluff to be minus a and I
don't
think I don't think he will call enough
so let's say he only calls the ones
without a diamond because he thinks have
a

[23:00]
I don't have a flush draw he's still
folding probably about
60% not more yeah it's very hard for
that play not to B plus
if and then higher e to the alternative
of checking even though checking does

[23:15]
of checking even though checking does
obviously have some EV because sometimes
we just check he has nothing and then uh
yeah we take it from there sort of

[23:31]
we have a lot of hands to choose from
here on the turn when it goes check
check to step uh and I think 74 of
Hearts is very low in the region so I
decided to just check that one I would
have just checked C and go from there
maybe lead some Rivers

[24:16]
would prefer to have a turned five here
but uh I think this one is also okay I
think I can straight away put qu of
pressure here on eights and nines and I
think he can still call with king queen
Ace King these type of Holdings so I
think this play is actually quite good

[24:30]
think this play is actually quite good
it's a jack eight I was pushing it maybe
a little bit but uh I think it's a fine
check race because like the Alternatives
I mean ace8 I guess would be a little
bit better he fought about for a little
while on cold now I did say he could
call me with uh with king queen Ace

[24:46]
call me with uh with king queen Ace
Queen Ace King so the king is obviously
very
good but obviously also now most of our
perceived range did complete I feel like
I have I have a mandatory Bluff I'm not
going to Bluff too big

[25:02]
because I have no I only have
unblockers and we just hoping that he's
going to fall the 10 or maybe something
like Jack n suited yeah he does have the
king so I think our plan of the turn was
quite good let me know if uh if I should

[25:15]
quite good let me know if uh if I should
follow through with that read he did
think about it for a little while in the
turn so I thought there was was a chance
he could maybe still have like a 10

[25:36]
so to see that here with king queen was
always going to barrel turn not that we
had a king
though let me see do we

[25:51]
have first recreational I don't mind
checking here with the King because I
feel like I'm dependent on Rivers for
three

[26:02]
here H having a seven here is not
great feel a bit obligated to call one
but I'm not too too thrilled about it
for recreational I feel like checking
and letting him Bluff River slightly
better on the

[26:18]
turn he very quickly checked the
river feel like he probably has a
nine that's kind of the way people like
to play this spot so I'm going to try to
get some value out of a

[26:30]
get some value out of a
nine this is very bad habit by the way
it's not it's not a habit I'm just doing
that
because this guy with how fast he
checked and you I'm playing vers unknown
vers known players you should be very
careful if you play against players a
lot you should probably not do this kind

[26:46]
lot you should probably not do this kind
of [ __ ] but you know I'm playing more in
a vacuum obviously uh since this is not
uh something I play on a daily basis

[27:19]
without a spade actually I think
delaying this 's also probably fine but
I like to just delay all my Jack Queen
Kings and just always check Aces it's
kind of the simplification that I have
for myself here if this gu see it's 1/3

[27:32]
for myself here if this gu see it's 1/3
I'm probably going to check race this
one I don't mind
it you goes for theate step with have an
easy

[27:48]
call is a
king should probably lead think on a

[28:05]
because he's going to check behind like
some pocket eights pocket
sixes only problem is if he did a river
a king we lose some value because he
would obviously B

[28:15]
would obviously B
bigger okay so we have pocket Jacks
interesting that hand will probably
check we probably that hand still bets
then we can race so that actually makes
way more money
I'm not really sure it kind of depends
on on what we put him on

[28:32]
on on what we put him on
right here for his recreational player I
think I like
checking this is obviously normally a a
range bet but that's in theory because
in theory when we check towards someone

[28:45]
in theory when we check towards someone
on the board that it's good for us
nothing is really going to happen right
but obviously for recreation that's a
little bit different so I I check and
let them do something funky at some
point

[29:08]
didn't
bite yeah pocket sixes it's a hand he
could bite

[29:15]
with here Pock Jacks is quite
interesting we're playing a bit over 100
BB
deep what is
better what is better
not really sure what is better to be

[29:30]
not really sure what is better to be
honest betting or checking obviously if
you have Jack you prefer to bet more
than if you have Aces for example
because he could not have for example
king
queen I feel like just if you
check the random factor of fish that

[29:45]
check the random factor of fish that
just adds a lot of
value and it's a board
where you know we are dependent
on decently clean run out for us to to
make some money money okay so far I'm
pretty happy half pot long timing so as

[30:02]
pretty happy half pot long timing so as
long as he doesn't Jam or pot I'll
probably call him off think about very
long now why is he thinking so long
would have checked a little bit faster I
would have definitely valed but I'm a
bit confused now I think I'm going to
bet small think we just usually have the
best hand but all with the timing I'm a

[30:16]
best hand but all with the timing I'm a
little bit concerned as
well so he was thinking about having
nothing like the faster he checks there
the more I think he just has a 10 or
pocket eight but when he starts thinking
for so long it's either he has nothing

[30:30]
for so long it's either he has nothing
or a trap so I think think I should have
went went with that read and checked
behind to be honest I think it's an
interesting example again of how timing
changes the range and how that then
changes the play that we want to be
making well but but but you did the

[30:47]
making well but but but you did the
complete opposite I know yeah so my I I
guess my confidence at that moment in my
read it just felt a bit too bad to check
back jacks
opening Deuces here with one Recreation

[31:01]
opening Deuces here with one Recreation
the blind actually there's also
Recreation here behind I'm not actually
in hindsight not really a big fan of it
but hey we're here
now definitely a must Barrel

[31:22]
here and 10 we probably have to check we
will win sometimes for hand like a Jack
or a not flush draw so I think we're
going to have to

[31:31]
going to have to
check he com d three offs it okay okay
did expect that hand to
fold do three offsuit not bad man not

[31:45]
fold do three offsuit not bad man not
bad ow me pretty hard he was like I put
you on
doces he was right oh wow that was a
very loose call do three offit
yeah did not see that one coming to be
honest

[32:03]
let check back here with the King
High and probably betting the

[32:22]
turn just putting straight away a l of
pressure on like his fourth pair type of
Holdings I didn't really go to because
it's a double flush draw board it's
going to be straight so if you think

[32:30]
going to be straight so if you think
about for example if we have an ace
there's double flush draw
there's uh there's like the straight
completing River so there's a lot of bad
rivers and the bigger we go the easier
time it is for him to just fold all his

[32:45]
time it is for him to just fold all his
weak
hands and call with only strong hands
and that would obviously be not great
for
us here actually with king queen off I
wouldn't actually have mind calling as
well because we're doing a BB deep then
I think calling this

[33:01]
I think calling this
hand is also going to be viable
option but I saw that after I threw B
wer you should have looked at that
before you threw B valid
advice going to call here I think with

[33:17]
advice going to call here I think with
the Ace King suited keep the
recreational in to be fair I think this
recreational we kept him the other time
as
well but like stacking this deep against
this guy I mean we do have Ace King

[33:31]
this guy I mean we do have Ace King
suited but it plays okay multiway not
really sure but I think it's
fine going to call and then if this guy
calls I and the turn is a blank I'll
probably would need to

[33:47]
lead it's not a
blank this one's very interesting
I feel like I cannot really check

[34:03]
fault leading
small it's probably a good
play huh I have no clue as you can saw I

[34:17]
play huh I have no clue as you can saw I
clicked all
buttons
uh yeah I don't know

[34:30]
like the problem is is he going to race
now with a
king it's a very weird spot

[34:54]
now this hand has gotten pretty funky
if I might say

[35:09]
so okay well that makes it a lot easier
so he had me beat on the turn oh

[35:17]
how oh [ __ ] I wanted to see the
hands oh wow I was very much beat on the
turn so the recreational had King 10

[35:30]
turn so the recreational had King 10
with the redraw to Spades and the
regular had King 10 so both that is
straight on turn with a redraw to
Diamonds very interesting spot so
yeah I felt like I couldn't really check
fault Ace King on turn and it being

[35:47]
fault Ace King on turn and it being
checked around is a bit too much of a
waste very interesting spot let me know
what you guys think guys comments Down
Below have we lost our mind or did we
play that hand pretty well for

[36:30]
definitely going to go twice
here with
five it's a very bad

[36:47]
River can we do
something nah I think we just have to
check and lose that's unfortunate
check with the pocket

[37:00]
check with the pocket
sixes he thre B at small free
flop check out
one3 yeah that's just that's Queen is
just a very bad card there's just not

[37:15]
just a very bad card there's just not
much we can do there there is a barrel
here pocket Force for sure
fult you when the board is paed you
probably don't want you don't want to
have a club so I do think it's a spot
where the higher Paris the better it
becomes so six is then is low and it has

[37:30]
becomes so six is then is low and it has
a club
so easy check with the queen
Jack easy Bluff on the turn but he
already

[37:49]
Bluffs is this guy
recreational this guy's a recreational I
don't really want to be folding

[38:02]
it's bit out of
line but the recreational was usually
also quite out of
line so then it's out of line versus out
of
line bad timing bad

[38:25]
timing um
probably do something here go for an

[38:31]
probably do something here go for an
over
but so for his recreational H like on
that board recreational is going to be
stabbing pretty out of line I think if
we had the queen and the Jack we make a
lot of money if we had a king or or if
if we hit if a king or an ace comes I

[38:45]
if we hit if a king or an ace comes I
think he can definitely be scared so
there's a good card to
Bluff uh on the river nine with the
heart he continued his story betting
half pot thought there was a good chance
I mean if you look at the betting range
there Rec is going to contain a bunch of
third pair fourth pair um and a bunch of

[39:02]
third pair fourth pair um and a bunch of
air so I figured just raising versus de
range is overall pretty good play
obviously he Rea it look pretty stupid
but uh I'm pretty happy with my play
there can also raise a turn that's also
completely fine but I like to raise the

[39:15]
completely fine but I like to raise the
turn there let's say I actually have Ace
King that's actually when I would like
to raise the turn there
he's call pocket N I think flop might

[39:30]
he's call pocket N I think flop might
straight away be a fault without a
diamond I kind of depends on the sizing
that he uses when he pets this size I
cannot really fault now can
I maybe he want doesn't want you TOA
because he has t or Jacks and AAC here I

[39:46]
because he has t or Jacks and AAC here I
think we have an easy
call and probably check on in once on
the

[40:01]
Flop he now checks turn I think we have
an easy

[40:17]
check is this a
thing is this a thing is this a thing is
this a thing is this a
thing I don't know is a thing but I like
it more than check

[40:32]
it more than check
calling could be that I only have a
bluff here let's see if he figures that
out I love playing
Just R random stuff that comes up in

[40:46]
Just R random stuff that comes up in
your hat you just do it you know because
you're playing in a vacuum in an unknown
pool versus guys that you don't know
let's see if he figures it out and just
calls me with the Ace King like for
example if he has Ace King no suits this
good spot to jam because I would then
have to call Ace Jack so I was going to

[41:00]
have to call Ace Jack so I was going to
call a jack
anyway so now I figured if I'm going to
call ajck anyway in a vacuum maybe
jamming is better now obviously if you
make a play like this in a vacuum he can
now think why would you front jam and
the only reason would be well because I
have a draw so if he figures that out

[41:15]
have a draw so if he figures that out
then he earns my
money yeah he figured it
out I love it very well played by him
very well played so I think this is
great illustration of why you should be

[41:30]
great illustration of why you should be
careful doing this kind of
[ __ ] uh is this a call probably not in
like these TI formations you have to be

[41:45]
like these TI formations you have to be
really
careful but he does bet
one3 this very close race race may be an
option
I'm probably getting a little bit out of
line here if I do anything but I'm still

[42:03]
line here if I do anything but I'm still
calling there half but definitely
folding feel like like when the board
becomes lower you usually want to bet a
bit bigger than the one3 that you choose
mainly to get out these type of hands so
I feel like for that small sizing the

[42:15]
I feel like for that small sizing the
30% feel like he's kind of pricing me in
to do something but I can be wrong here
because I've also seen this spot being
very um
being very

[42:32]
nitty and easy go again on the

[42:47]
turn probably want to be bluffing at
Jack that's for sure but do we want to
be bluffing this hand
if we're going to Bluff it's probably a

[43:01]
if we're going to Bluff it's probably a
small
sizing do we even have that many checks
I think we might even have to Bluff
this I like six and a

[43:16]
this I like six and a
half we F about it for very long though
so I don't know
uh I don't know's how he's gonna read
this but do we even have a jack which
Jack do we even have King Jack using

[43:30]
Jack do we even have King Jack using
forward a Jack he jams yeah I mean
that's very very likely to happen it's
fine it's not a problem because he has
like the king queen off with a heart he
has like kings with a
heart this bat is mainly

[43:46]
heart this bat is mainly
designed to make him fold the same hand
as
me or maybe like a hand like Ace King of
Clubs
but
hey like I said could be losing my might

[44:03]
hey like I said could be losing my might
pretty sure if I mean solver is going to
have like some King Jack there I'm
pretty sure he's going to turn that into
a bluff

[44:26]
there for

[45:04]
six I guess I can have a
six can you have a six yeah I can have a
six six seven suited 68 suited but
that's about

[45:21]
it okay I think we're going to be
