okay now checks back and this is
probably the point where we're just
gonna try to get some value
he calls
he had seven dudes so soon
that guy is crazy

are you all guys and girls
and everything in the middle or that's
still undefined i feel hot running
coming well i hope so as well man let's
transfer this good feelings up to the
stream you are lucky you're skillful and
you will win
we sure will guys come on i'm lucky
i am skillful and i will win you got to
feel it can we feel it i'm going to
start out with a check here with the
jack 3.
that's a jack
i'm gonna check again why not
he starts bedding
okay
i call
bad
river
as in he's sometimes going to have rivet
n9 actually maybe we should have thrown
out a small lead on the river actually i
would have preferred that
i think now
jack six right now that's close
but he just had the five seven off suit
okay so it didn't really matter if we
would have raced or if he would have
called
we gave him a little bit of extra rope
and he used it
try to bluff us
so uh first trap well executed by the
wacko i would say now we're gonna go
straight into flopping monsters pocket
sixes guys and we all know now how to
play pocket pairs
okay the last tip i have for you is on
small pocket pairs
and these are hands that you can win
monster
massive pots guys this is not a massive
pot but definitely a flop that we're
gonna continue on at least one
phase of one third
and we're going to
continue by pressing the
the call
turn the queen is a very bad card
and does he ever three bet
and eight suited
now h is probably a better continue okay
block again strong strong versus block i
would say
still calling
but
you know as you can see from the look of
my face not very happy
i think eighth is actually a fine hand
to call down with especially if we're
blocking eight nine suited we're now not
blocking any values of e gems we have a
pure
i mean we both would have a bluff
catcher but aids would be a better bluff
catcher if we at least block some of the
value tense kind of goes both ways
but hey it's none of our concern because
he's chickened out on the river
got a little chicken sound for you pal
you see guys eating at 10 20.
[Music]
we have to get out the chicken song
okay flop
easy cool
turn
facing barrel
easy call
interesting river
as
king queen is the nuts
very interesting i think if he had a
queen himself you should probably check
i would intuitively say
we do block jax which i don't think
actually is that relevant
we i don't think it's relevant as jax
will probably just check the turn we do
have a queen which is obviously good
just trying to see if i'm not missing
maybe a potential hero fault here but i
don't think so
so let's go
yeah yeah king queen
not really sure what's a better
call
i come i think it's an interesting gem
from his side to be honest
would i prefer a check with his hand
would i prefer a check with this hand
i think i would have prefer a check with
his hand to be honest i thought the bet
in general was a bit strange there and
here called through the king jack
a six dusty tree better six yeah king
six off i guess
a6 off okay so the six is actually a
decent card for him
you know usually when there's a
pair on the board
immediately evaluating how much of these
pairs
someone might have is a
valid
valid strategy
so i'm gonna just call
and play it slow
and i kind of hope that he's going to
try to
leverage
that advantage in 6x
with a lot of aggression
well he does go for the bad bat so that
is uh
decent i would say
recall
interesting river
as it would have sometimes made him
like i said with like an eight
he checks i think he rivered d8 i think
it was going yolo he had ten five suited
reasonably yolo
[ __ ] aces i also think is an above
average starting hand
i'll start with a check
on the flop with two
deuces he checks as well
i'm gonna go for the check
again we're gonna play this funky
he now goes for the small delay
and i think we have a call
and a check again
and here we get barreled on with the as9
oh guys actually you're already seeing
everything
i'm gonna draw the
big ass race
the ace now we're gonna call down all
the way we check back the queen jack we
made the nuts
here
what are we actually saying that we have
if we raise we say something that we
have some ver something very good
let's just go for that
snap calls
this is how we trapping
so i will check
go for a small delay
calls
what to do on this river
i'm gonna go for blocky
do you need some help playing three bad
pots out of position well for that we
have created our master classes in which
we dedicate one coaching program to dive
very deep into a specific spot go over
to the site pokermission.com
masterclasses and eliminate those
weaknesses
trip sevens
they call it good hand
let's just go for a check race
oh
sweden hero decides to click and back
one a little history here on sweden
heroes sweden hero
has kind of moods i have a feeling he's
a mood player sometimes he has a crazy
mood and sometimes he's quite
[Music]
quite takes it quite easy
but let's hope he's in his crazy mood as
i'm probably not intending to press the
full button anytime soon
well there's a note on davey that's my
little secret my friend
and now checks back and this is probably
the point where we're just gonna try to
get some value
he calls
he had seven dudes so soon
that guy is crazy
he's just a drunken style guys i just
show them drunken style and i think it's
good for poker like bring some fun
enjoyment
let's say
you
know what they say
seven deuce
let me first squeeze this
actually i'll call with la bomba there
seven deuce
[ __ ] hell seven deuce
never lose
la boomba besides to bet that's quite
interesting
by the one betting he called from the
big blind
and proceed with calling
everyone calls
another bad now this is quite
interesting
i'm gonna put in a race
what's a dicey spot
interesting spot
vip is thinking if he calls he probably
has
a combo draw like king 10
diamonds king jacket diamonds
or
a boat
at least two pair or something okay well
now it's not so hard anymore so here we
flop something very good so let's uh
call
there's a block
seven eight seven four i think low flush
like this is probably just calling
this is this size and do we still jam
three four
seven
it's gonna be very hard for me to have
lower flashes have we have the eight and
a nine so i'm just gonna call i guess
dubious dubious dubious dubious
play the song all right i'll play this
song flusu i'll play this song
[Music]
a three right here with the packed kings
and a cold four bed from mr freezer
that's not great news they're a little
bit deeper
which i guess would only tighten up mr
cold forward range so this is a spot
where
yeah you know we're not gonna be very
happy
but as they say guys as they say
just gonna ship it in and go to
bed i think it's just time to ship it in
and go to bed
yes kings okay
i'll take it
here flop a little flush draw
gonna call
turn six
a decent turn
i'm gonna ship it in
actually i'm getting a little deja vu
and not in a good way
i hope to get called here by ace king
i think ace king no
okay he thanks for a very long time with
king jack then my gem is quite good nico
shell here joins the table from
argentina vamos
vamos nico
[Music]
i got a three
bet definitely going to throw a little
forward
guys we're all in with ace king what the
[ __ ] let's gamble baby girl here we go
baby girl
here we go okay
come on [ __ ]
you hat
jax oh my god
king
king king king king come on
okay ours was a little bit less dramatic
as we just chopped
squeezing here with the aces
wow rene you're so good squeeze with
pocket aces
some very advanced plays here guys don't
try this at home
basic click
now let's put our helmut face on and go
in the trap
uh
that's not a good turn
it barrels
it's quite close
yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah can i even play in
this game i mean what the [ __ ] they find
oh i mean what the [ __ ]
i mean how can i even play in this game
it's like i just get cheated i mean hand
after hand after hand
sweden's hero decides to go for three
but
last time actually folded
actually don't mind
actually i don't mind either way he's
been quite aggressive
uh
let's go for the call
i don't mind actually a 4-bet as well
so when i'm liking dubious you know i
just look at the rng and
kind of go go with that
so don't really have a specific reason
to always do one already either
and a call
and i'm not really intending to fold so
if he has a better hand than gg
you bet spot
though i'm trying to
go in my memory of
times that he better the size of the pot
don't really recall
but he seems to be in his crazy mood so
definitely not folding
it's a good river
so i think it's just one of these spots
where if he does have
ace king you know
then good for him
he's just been
so out of line in the past i guess we're
blocking three four pseudo which against
versus him is even uh relevant
but yeah i'm not happy
ace king okay gg okay so we have a cold
call here open
three bet cold call from me soon
let's jam
good luck me only pre guys queen
seriously because queens are i love
yesterday everything with queens he
raced he had he bro no king races we
we're all in baby we're all in this is
it this is a big moment of truth this is
it
either we wing everything or we lose
everything but we come on baby there we
go tense is a good hand for us
no
