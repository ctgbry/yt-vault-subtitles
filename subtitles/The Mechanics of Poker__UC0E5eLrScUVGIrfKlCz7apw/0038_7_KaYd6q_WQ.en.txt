hi there fellow poker players and
welcome back
to the poker ambition channel and to
another video
where this time i'm going to be taking a
look
at river races again we will most likely
not have much so let's hope

[00:31]
not have much so let's hope
they get through if you haven't seen any
of the other videos where we were
talking about
dunk bedding or triple barreling go
check them out
and remember that if you learned
something give this video a like
also subscribe as we have more videos
coming up

[00:45]
coming up
and without further ado let's get into
the hands
so the first hand we are playing
three-handed with born to tilt and katja
at 25.50 we get raised there is a little
anti involved
so he raises a little bit bigger i

[01:00]
so he raises a little bit bigger i
defend with the jack eight
so far pretty standard he checks i
decide to check back
uh can kind of go either way
the turn is uh 10
which is an interesting turn and katja

[01:15]
which is an interesting turn and katja
decides to go for a delay
we could do two things here in my
opinion we could
either call or race
i don't think falling is really an
option i decided to call
already a little bit with the idea in

[01:30]
already a little bit with the idea in
mind that i could potentially raise the
river
as i do like my hand for it river is an
ace
and we face a little potbed here on the
river
and to start you know guys already know
what's gonna happen

[01:45]
what's gonna happen
as the video is teamed river races we
decided not to fault and we decided to
throw out a little race in terms of
sizing i went for 3k
um it's kind of interesting here
if he just bets three quarters i think

[02:00]
if he just bets three quarters i think
we have an easy race
that's not a win and now it becomes
quite dicey how tinder we want to raise
still for value
the ace kickers now don't really play
anymore so you could almost say that
we're basically only raising king 10
plus

[02:15]
plus
and that could actually go just for an
over bet or
for a big race sizing like at all in
sizing i decided to go for a little
smaller race
uh let's hope katja didn't
didn't see through it he indeed didn't

[02:30]
didn't see through it he indeed didn't
uh and he folded nicely i think he for
example he could also have the same hand
as me
and then you know if we both have jack 8
it's whoever puts
the most money in the pot last kind of
wins
and luckily in this time in this case

[02:45]
and luckily in this time in this case
that was
[Music]
me
we face a race we defend in the big
blind versus under o
okay flop as we flop a flush draw and an
overcard
phase one towards seabed we check off

[03:03]
phase one towards seabed we check off
turn as a queen under old chex
river is a 10 now we kind of have the
debate should we
bet or check in general i think at 10

[03:17]
bet or check in general i think at 10
it's maybe a little bit weak i think if
i had a queen or better i could
definitely see myself value betting i
think
uh with the 10 i think checking is maybe
better he bets three quarters
and i decided to jam it in and this is

[03:31]
and i decided to jam it in and this is
actually a quite
common line to do a lot of check raising
i think i have some more lines
where basically your opponent sort of is
capping himself
um like i don't think he has jack nine
or six nine all that often
i also don't think he has a flush all

[03:45]
i also don't think he has a flush all
that often uh ace jack is a possibility
which i don't think also he see bets all
that often
pocket tense is less likely as we now
have a 10 ace jack is also less likely
because we now
we have a blocker to that so in general

[04:00]
we have a blocker to that so in general
all these ingredients will lead you to
do
quite a lot of raising and it's not like
we have an enormous amount of loss here
because let's say for example we had the
ace of hearts with the five of clubs
we would have most probably better the

[04:15]
we would have most probably better the
river ourselves so
the good thing about a bluff like this
is that we have to be turning a
a made hand into a bluff as is where
as if we had nothing we were more likely
to bet the river ourselves so that's why
i think
this spot in general could get a little

[04:31]
this spot in general could get a little
bit more credit or in general river race
spots
where it's unlikely that you have
complete air
uh are quite good spots in my opinion
too bluff race
and he indeed folded so we may win a

[04:46]
and he indeed folded so we may win a
nice little pot here
we have ace nine the small band limps in
we decided to raise it up and the small
bite calls six
eight ten boards check check don't think

[05:02]
eight ten boards check check don't think
it's a board i'm gonna be c
betting all that much on
if the small blind limp calls i think it
connects okay with his limp calling
range
um as that's more in the middle and my
isolation range is a little

[05:15]
isolation range is a little
bit more like middle top and bottom so
and in general i think s9 is a fine hand
to check back
we face a block which i think we have an
easy call or race i decided to call
and the river is a king and he decides

[05:30]
and the river is a king and he decides
to barrel and now i decide to race
and basically what's going on here is
it's mainly a blocker play i would say
as we're blocking seven nine as we're
blocking jack nine as we're blocking ace
jack
basically we're blocking all the
potential strong hands
in venice range you could also say that

[05:47]
in venice range you could also say that
he is
maybe a little bit capped for example i
had like ace jack
would most likely not always limp coal
if he had ajax you could limb raise
or if he has an ace jack in general he
could maybe raise the flop so
i think also not combo wise he is a

[06:01]
i think also not combo wise he is a
little bit reduced
uh king queen i think it also makes
sense for us to play this way
in terms of bluffs uh
yeah we should then maybe turn and like
ace eight or something in the block but

[06:15]
ace eight or something in the block but
then again
we can also just call versus a7 or ace
nine and win
um so i don't think we have that much
hands that could be bluffing maybe have
like pocket nines uh
could be okay can they but then again
that's also an okay candidate

[06:30]
that's also an okay candidate
call um and ace nine
not a great candidate to call obviously
he fortunately did decide to call and he
had king ten well
not much we can do there we could have

[06:45]
not much we can do there we could have
maybe in terms of race sizing
with our exact hand co bigger it's
really blocking
all the straights this is probably like
the dream hand to just shove
um and put like i had like king 10 in
quite a tough spot
because basically king 10 now becomes a

[07:00]
because basically king 10 now becomes a
bluff catcher uh
king jack would probably then be a
better call than a hand like king 10.
so good race i like the way i played my
hand but i think in the river we were a
little bit uh
a little bit chicken should have just

[07:15]
a little bit chicken should have just
maybe ripped or stacking
i think that would have been a better
play
especially like if especially that he
went block turn bad big river
he is saying that he's like king jack
plus i would say

[07:31]
plus i would say
um so versus a range like that i think
racing bigger makes more sense let's say
even block block
then i think raising smaller makes a
little bit more sense
um as we are gonna also raise a little
bit of a wider range for value

[07:45]
bit of a wider range for value
that for example would include glute
king jack
we face a raise on the button we call
queen 10 off in the small blind
a little bit loose a little bit loose

[08:02]
a little bit loose a little bit loose
but you know we came to play some poker
not game there to sit around we decided
to draw a little dunk bat while we had a
dumbbell video earlier
if you haven't seen that one make sure
to check that out

[08:15]
he calls on the term we decide to
check okay we could block again
but yeah there's probably not a lot of
value in there we definitely don't want
to get raised so i think check calling
is a fine strategy with his hand
he checks as well river is an ace

[08:33]
he checks as well river is an ace
i again don't think we have a value bet
so then it becomes a check
he bets and i think now the discussion
is do we call or do we race
and given the trend of this video
spoiler alert i did make a race

[08:45]
spoiler alert i did make a race
this time i went a little bit bigger as
i guess i'm saying i have
10 jack or better i would say or ace
jack or better i think ace jack is
definitely a head that could bet
flop check turn same when i had like ace

[09:00]
flop check turn same when i had like ace
ten
bucket threes could be but i think it's
a little bit more likely i'll bet that
on the turn myself
so i'm mainly going in towards that
region i think king queen
i would most likely bet myself as well
but could be perceived as a trap
and um again with the 10 we're blocking

[09:16]
and um again with the 10 we're blocking
like his best
ace i would say ace 10 is a hand that he
could often play
this way so yeah
i definitely like my play here

[09:30]
and he did indeed fold
we're facing min raise from the button
mr zephyr shout out to mrs zephyr
hardcore grinder a screen tree flop

[09:48]
hardcore grinder a screen tree flop
check check this is like i said this is
going to be also a common a common spot
the check check bats or the bat check
bet are
common spots to throw out a check
raising strategy
and i think this is a classic example of

[10:01]
and i think this is a classic example of
that again think a hand like 10 jack is
likely to have bat in either flop or
turn i think his best hand that he has
now on the river is pocket h that's very
likely to play this way or i have an 8
so that's already less likely

[10:16]
so that's already less likely
again it's a spot where if i check the
river i most likely have
something of the shonen value if i've
completed nothing i'm more likely
checking
also if i've complete nothing like five
six or something i wouldn't do this
because you're kind of blocking his
bluffs so it makes it less likely for

[10:31]
bluffs so it makes it less likely for
him to belove and you're not bluffing
blocking any of his call range so
basically those two factors will make
his best full percentage go down which
is obviously bad for the evie of your
bluff
and i'm blocking i think even ace eight

[10:47]
and i'm blocking i think even ace eight
is most likely not playing this way
queen eight could be
um but yeah overall blocker he is
quite capped um and we are still unkept
so i think in general this is probably
the most classic example of throwing a

[11:01]
the most classic example of throwing a
lot of river races
we're gonna stick here with the jacket
we get delta jack 8
back to back and we're going to play a
little part against mr otb

[11:16]
little part against mr otb
oh to be a libsyn that's the flop as
he's going to do
very high frequency we obviously have a
continue
he bets the turn which i think he's also
going to do at a high frequency and we
again have a continue
and the river the flush completes and he

[11:30]
and the river the flush completes and he
decides to block
um i mean basically the sort of the same
trend continues
i did actually however decide to go for
a little bit of a smaller race
and this is kind of what i talked about
earlier basically when he's blocking
he's
saying that he's still sort of value

[11:45]
saying that he's still sort of value
betting thin um
and i'm for example saying that i'm
still raising a hand like 1080 there or
even
no deuce eight i'm probably following
the turn let's say i have hands like 10
i'm saying that i'm still raising that
in this way also my blocker is quite

[12:00]
in this way also my blocker is quite
relevant
it's less likely that he has a straight
it's less likely that he has a flush
so in general again due to the blockers
his full percentage will go up
did we bluff the otb that is the
question did we manage to block him

[12:15]
question did we manage to block him
or maybe we had the best hand in this
case that could have definitely also
been the case
uh shout out to the otb but we did
win the pot
king queen we open the button eccentric

[12:31]
king queen we open the button eccentric
defense in the big blind
flop is a7 deuce rainbow
he checks we check behind i think this
is a fine candidate
for a check pack turn is a 10

[12:45]
for a check pack turn is a 10
you can easily call the turnout if he
bets but he doesn't he checks again
i think no reason to bet as we still
have quite a lot of showdown value
everywhere is a 10 again and now it kind
of gets interesting we face a big path
and i decide to go for a very big race

[13:00]
and i decide to go for a very big race
and again it's kind of
optimal use of blockers i block his
strongest king 10
and queen 10 so basically due to my
blockage i'm allowed to go quite
big i am
in terms of uncappedness i'm not 100

[13:15]
in terms of uncappedness i'm not 100
sure
um i think he could definitely serve
seven's deuces which i don't have
i can have aces which he doesn't have um
yeah but i think mainly if he has a 10
like a low 10 he's in quite a lot of

[13:30]
like a low 10 he's in quite a lot of
trouble so i think king queen exactly is
probably
the nut combination here to throw out
some razor some of the time
and obviously there's still a chance of
the fact that he was just bluffing i
could also call this hand this end is

[13:45]
could also call this hand this end is
actually a little bit more interesting
than let's say if i had a hand like
five six of spades five sixes baits
obviously cannot call
so the race i can just make a little
small raisin doesn't
if it just works enough then it's fine
but here also obviously i can call

[14:01]
but here also obviously i can call
so my race basically has to be better
than my call so you could also make an
argument for calling here
i would say and maybe
race like your jack
queen if i had that but that's kind of
the problem but

[14:15]
the problem but
most likely i've i would have had bet
that on the turn
or maybe on the flop
and he indeed folds um and i think king
10 quintana definitely has that i can
play this way so i think the story
definitely checks out

[14:33]
king 10 we open the button
get called by the big blind
face check as we learned a port that
could have been dunked back from the

[14:45]
could have been dunked back from the
other position he didn't
don't know if he has a dunk but strategy
uh if he doesn't don't but his range is
still intact if he does have a dumbbell
strategy maybe we could already start
reducing some hands in his range
i decided to go for a bat three quarters
it's a bit big actually
nowadays it would maybe size a little

[15:00]
nowadays it would maybe size a little
bit smaller on this board but i don't
think it's bad
he calls turn is a 10 definitely a spot
that i'm going to be barreling
draw towards the nuts
he calls again and the river is a 10

[15:17]
he calls again and the river is a 10
and now it actually gets interesting
dino dunks out the river maybe he has
seen our videos
and it's an interesting spot
as i think he is correct for dunking

[15:32]
as i think he is correct for dunking
not sure though about sizing um
i think a smaller sizing could maybe be
a bit more appropriate
as he doesn't have the real nuts in his
range basically on the flop i went three
quarters i think

[15:45]
quarters i think
king queen maybe with a heart could be
peeling that's true
uh is it is it leading the river not
sure
and eight is definitely could definitely
lead the river a bluff could definitely
derive let's say yes a6
or uh a flush draw that that missed

[16:01]
or uh a flush draw that that missed
or maybe he's just turning like a seven
six into a bluff these are all possible
um possible scenarios so i decided the
fact that it's very likely for him
unlikely for him to have
a hand like king queen i have a blocker

[16:16]
a hand like king queen i have a blocker
to 10 8 so i do block
some eight i guess for what it's worth
but mainly i think if he
had if he has a bluff
uh again obviously with the 10 i am

[16:30]
uh again obviously with the 10 i am
beating a bluff
but i just don't think he has he has
king queen
and i don't think this line is very
popularly bluffed
by the imposition like you you need some
balls to block races river
a little bit narcissistic maybe but

[16:48]
yeah let's see if they know
if dino maybe wants to respond comes
what he had he did in default
probably very likely chance that i just
had the best hand but
maybe he did indeed fold an eight i also

[17:01]
maybe he did indeed fold an eight i also
think by the way in terms of queen eight
he doesn't have queen eight uh i can
have queen eight i can have king queen
so again i raise the river from a
perspective of
um i have a love not attends that you
don't have

[17:15]
don't have
and this is also why you should be
careful throwing out
big dunk bets on the river as we have
discussed in the dunk bedding video
so these were some river race spots i
hope you enjoyed them
don't think we really lost a lot of them

[17:31]
don't think we really lost a lot of them
i would almost say that maybe i was
because i think they were very good
examples but
in my database i found only very good
examples which actually could be
it could be a tell that that maybe
should be a little bit less

[17:45]
should be a little bit less
strict with my criteria for making a
river race so maybe this is actually
something i'll take in consideration
uh in general i hope that this video and
all the other videos as well
is gonna give me a little bit extra
action on my river
aggression so i'm gonna make a lot of

[18:00]
aggression so i'm gonna make a lot of
money indirectly out of these videos
as i will definitely lower my bluffing
frequencies a little bit
uh i hope you liked this video and again
like always poker [ __ ] it cannot be
hold responsible guys for any river
races
that you make that don't go through

[18:15]
that you make that don't go through
don't go send us a bill don't
send your lawyer towards us small
disclaimer
but other than that guys do try to take
away something from these videos good
spots to river race and
increase your frequency in the right
spots with the right hand
okay make sure to not miss them thank

[18:31]
okay make sure to not miss them thank
you very much make sure to give the
video a thumbs up if you liked it
