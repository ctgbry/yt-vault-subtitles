friday night
welcome to the party
okay all jokes aside my tape was a
little bit low
that's off the table a little bit
what's up guys welcome to another
episode of the weko show i'm the weko

[01:01]
episode of the weko show i'm the weko
this is my show
and today we're gonna play some online
poker
get a through bed here
going to call

[01:16]
it's a good flop
assuming he doesn't have ace king races
then it would be very bad floppy checks
don't think i'm gonna bet the turn

[01:32]
i think checking is the way to go
with the majority of my range
he now goes for a delayed c bet we have
an easy call

[01:53]
and i think we have an easy check raise
here on the river

[02:01]
he gave up with a screen i think ace
queen especially the a screen suited in
these positions how the board was i
think it's a
probably good candidate to just start
triple barreling i think checking
then delaying and then giving up river

[02:15]
then delaying and then giving up river
is probably the
yeah the line that i preferred the least

[02:34]
now with a check
there's a bet
and i'm going to start by calling
and let the random factor generate ev

[02:54]
same for the river

[03:01]
okay he had an ace so definitely going
to adjust
because obviously my thought process was
if i check he's going to baton ace
himself and then we can check rates
whereas if we bet he would just colonize
and we block a lot of the medium hands

[03:15]
and we block a lot of the medium hands
that he could bet the flop with check
draniko river like
uh the king jacks the jack queens so
that's why i decided to go for that line
but obviously if he's checking back and
ace that's not optimal so we have one of
these recreationals that kind of forgets
to value that the weko is consistent

[03:31]
to value that the weko is consistent
streamer and those get rewarded thank
you very much sir
no tax on poker winnings in the uk son
yeah that is definitely true

[03:47]
got my favorite hand there guys
bye for suited
i'll get a full
back to aces
bro

[04:09]
can actually also make an argument to uh
to check river reduces i think i think

[04:16]
to check river reduces i think i think
actually that's a better play in
hindsight

[04:30]
yeah i think checking the river reduces
is better i like my turnover but i think
the river is a check
there's actually a chance that he
now by betting we actually opened
ourselves up to get bluffed

[04:45]
here we face a river check race
i think we have a fold bucket fives

[05:04]
let's see a flop
check then let's squeeze

[05:15]
and i think i'm just gonna fold
actually this is probably a call
but
this is probably a call

[05:31]
much rather full pocket eights
think about that one for a second
so he checks
i think i should have done my betting

[05:45]
i think i should have done my betting
now

[06:04]
and i think on the river
i'm going to be jamming

[06:15]
and he folds
incredibly strong and aggressive play
[Music]
feel the power
you feel my power baby not really sure
what to do with this hand
i think it can go either way

[06:34]
same for the turn i would say
display it smooth man i didn't play it
smooth that's kind of the problem

[06:51]
one time the check race
can we get it in one time
can we get in the check race oh

[07:02]
can we get in the check race oh
[Music]
keep on scrolling keep on scrolling keep
on scrolling baby

[07:15]

oh what happened here
i accidentally posted

[07:32]

[08:00]
i'm not mistaking this is considered the
nuts

[08:32]
more

[08:52]
cognitive plenty goes for the four bet
on the other table so he went for the
memories out of the side this time to
three bet and not call e4 bets we have

[09:00]
three bet and not call e4 bets we have
an easy call a little bit deeper
that is a 10
that is it then even without charlie
guys even without charlie
i feel he's going to fire a lot

[09:15]
and then he checks
but hey what do i know
how would you check
why would you check
i'd check

[09:30]
on tibet
okay so ah
don't ask me what's going on here
i went for a little bit of a delayed bat
here
with the pocket tents

[09:45]
with the pocket tents
and i get checked meme raced
i call
now he checks

[10:08]
um
[Music]

[10:19]

happiness on the flop

you do that so dumb
okay sorry i did do it i'm gonna barrel

[12:22]

river

[12:33]
i would be so sick if he
jammed he just calls his king five

[13:08]
just gonna start off with a seabed

[13:16]
think having the queen of spades
will not make me barrel then we pink the
queen
now we are barreling

you could have made queen jack of hearts
king queen of hearts so that's good

[18:20]
as let's say if you would have had my
favorite hand five for suited
or pocket force
see if pocket force is less likely

[18:37]
actually this could be a but
then show over bluff spot for him

[18:45]
