friday night
welcome to the party
okay all jokes aside my tape was a
little bit low
that's off the table a little bit
what's up guys welcome to another
episode of the weko show i'm the weko
this is my show
and today we're gonna play some online
poker
get a through bed here
going to call
it's a good flop
assuming he doesn't have ace king races
then it would be very bad floppy checks
don't think i'm gonna bet the turn
i think checking is the way to go
with the majority of my range
he now goes for a delayed c bet we have
an easy call
and i think we have an easy check raise
here on the river
he gave up with a screen i think ace
queen especially the a screen suited in
these positions how the board was i
think it's a
probably good candidate to just start
triple barreling i think checking
then delaying and then giving up river
is probably the
yeah the line that i preferred the least
now with a check
there's a bet
and i'm going to start by calling
and let the random factor generate ev
same for the river
okay he had an ace so definitely going
to adjust
because obviously my thought process was
if i check he's going to baton ace
himself and then we can check rates
whereas if we bet he would just colonize
and we block a lot of the medium hands
that he could bet the flop with check
draniko river like
uh the king jacks the jack queens so
that's why i decided to go for that line
but obviously if he's checking back and
ace that's not optimal so we have one of
these recreationals that kind of forgets
to value that the weko is consistent
streamer and those get rewarded thank
you very much sir
no tax on poker winnings in the uk son
yeah that is definitely true
got my favorite hand there guys
bye for suited
i'll get a full
back to aces
bro
can actually also make an argument to uh
to check river reduces i think i think
actually that's a better play in
hindsight
yeah i think checking the river reduces
is better i like my turnover but i think
the river is a check
there's actually a chance that he
now by betting we actually opened
ourselves up to get bluffed
here we face a river check race
i think we have a fold bucket fives
let's see a flop
check then let's squeeze
and i think i'm just gonna fold
actually this is probably a call
but
this is probably a call
much rather full pocket eights
think about that one for a second
so he checks
i think i should have done my betting
now
and i think on the river
i'm going to be jamming
and he folds
incredibly strong and aggressive play
[Music]
feel the power
you feel my power baby not really sure
what to do with this hand
i think it can go either way
same for the turn i would say
display it smooth man i didn't play it
smooth that's kind of the problem
one time the check race
can we get it in one time
can we get in the check race
can we get in the check race oh
[Music]
keep on scrolling keep on scrolling keep
on scrolling baby
no no no not deep on scroll
what spot
nice little race
oh what happened here
i accidentally posted
i already have my hand on the give it to
me baby clip
no i thought
i'm not mistaking this is considered the
nuts
more
cognitive plenty goes for the four bet
on the other table so he went for the
memories out of the side this time to
three bet and not call e4 bets we have
an easy call a little bit deeper
that is a 10
that is it then even without charlie
guys even without charlie
i feel he's going to fire a lot
and then he checks
but hey what do i know
how would you check
why would you check
i'd check
on tibet
okay so ah
don't ask me what's going on here
i went for a little bit of a delayed bat
here
with the pocket tents
and i get checked meme raced
i call
now he checks
um
[Music]
no worries mate
good for the fans
i jinxed it guy i jinxed it with my
happiness on the flop
so i'll take full responsibility those
my jinx that
it was my cheeks that made this cooler
come true
yes yes you've asked for it
poker is such a fun game guys do you
need some help playing three bad pots
out of position well for that we have
created our master classes in which we
dedicate one coaching program to dive
very deep into a specific spot go over
to the site pokermission.com
masterclasses and eliminate those
weaknesses does adam consider green tea
and chocolate more plus vegan fruit than
us hmm
i'm not a i'm on a caffeine detox so no
green tea for me i think it's almost two
months no no at least one and a half
month
best if you've ever started to climb up
solve our poo tendencies
you clearly have not
participated in our free webinar how to
become a more a more successful poke
player and you've also not participated
in the academy
to see how to become a more successful
poker player part one
oh
we have a set
donkey donkey donkey let's go
make a little dunky dunky donkey
you [ __ ] dunk you do it again i
remember in a video before i've told you
to not dunk why do you do that why do
you do that so dumb
okay sorry i did do it i'm gonna barrel
i'm gonna do that again here on the
river
i would be so sick if he
jammed he just calls his king five
just gonna start off with a seabed
think having the queen of spades
will not make me barrel then we pink the
queen
now we are barreling
nicely
you could have made queen jack of hearts
king queen of hearts so that's good
[Music]
defaults
okay where's my screen
my screen suddenly went black
okay we're back
this is not our board
in doubt
been dubbed
it goes for a little delayed bet
now actually he says that he has a 10 i
don't believe it man
a screen acetus yes
oh my god that's got to be the greatest
call in poker oh my god
am i the best
10 admit it say it say it you have to
say it also through reality every day's
king what the [ __ ] my scream went black
again and came back interesting
oh two interesting answers
two by defaults
with the kings
unless you mis-clicked and folded the
set then it's great
calling one here with queens
bad river
as let's say if you would have had my
favorite hand five for suited
or pocket force
see if pocket force is less likely
actually this could be a but
then show over bluff spot for him
if he's not careful
so
disappointing father god damn son of a
[ __ ] [ __ ] bastard son of a [ __ ]
[ __ ] why the [ __ ] [ __ ] sucking hell
does this happen every [ __ ] time
[Music]
sorry c-bet
does he have to do seven
there's a little check race
for mr sweden
bad turn
bad turn but good hand
in terms of we're blocking like some
some ace five
but obviously we're not blocking any
five six
oh it goes all in
all right
good luck
and he has pocket threes
now that's very unfortunate
people are making sense god damn it
you have to be joking i mean and trying
not to be negative but god damn [ __ ]
