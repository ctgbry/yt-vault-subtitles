curious to find out what made him get to
high six that much faster than the other
players we have had on one thing he has

[02:46]
players we have had on one thing he has
in common with many of our previous

Mr good enough thank you for coming on

[05:17]
Mr good enough thank you for coming on
the podcast it's great to have you
yeah thank you for invite it's a
pleasure to be here
well I wanted to start off uh at the
beginning which is starting to become a

[05:30]
beginning which is starting to become a
trend actually on this podcast which is
a background in competitive Sports and
gaming now you mentioned that you
started playing football already at a
young age now many people who are
listening me included I've played
football when I was at a young age I've

[05:45]
football when I was at a young age I've
played video games however it was more
of a fun activity than something that I
was actually doing competitive and I was
wondering what made you take Sports and
later video games so competitive
yeah I mean I started to play football

[06:02]
yeah I mean I started to play football
series uh because of my coach it was
like uh pretty funny story because we
was just uh friends who was playing uh
on football field uh close to our school

[06:17]
on football field uh close to our school
we was playing every day and one day one
guy came to us and asked it uh do we
want to try to play professionally uh
some of us told yes and he made like

[06:31]
some of us told yes and he made like
small team from us he started to coach
us and then he
signed up uh some like some sort of
contract or I don't know what it was
between them but we started to play like
in a small gym in our city and this guy

[06:49]
in a small gym in our city and this guy
he was uh I mean he was like 40 years
old not 40 50 something and he was
ex-professional player he even played in
uh USSR team so he started to teach us

[07:05]
uh USSR team so he started to teach us
and also
you know I played much more than ours
because
I was pretty obsessed by the game it was
very interesting to me so like my

[07:17]
very interesting to me so like my
routine was I go to practice with team
when I go home I do something and then I
go to play with friends then friends
going to home and I just playing alone
trying to do some tricks or something

[07:30]
trying to do some tricks or something
like that uh I I can't even say why I
loved football that much
but I was just obsessed for it I was
like any time when I have some free time
when I don't don't need to do school

[07:46]
when I don't don't need to do school
things or something like that I was
playing football
all right so it was that it was mainly
like the coach that kind of saw
potential in you and your friends that
kind of planted the idea in your head

[08:00]
kind of planted the idea in your head
like hey guys you could maybe do this
professionally as well uh you also
I think the biggest point for him was uh
like it was Breaking Bad and hard times
in Russia and a lot of young people was

[08:16]
in Russia and a lot of young people was
drinking smoking and doing stuff like
this uh and he just wanted us to have a
normal life better life for us I think
it's like not about potential he wanted
to

[08:30]
to
give us a chance to be healthier to be
more successful because like he suffered
a lot of people who are ruining their
lives around
so like I think it was more mental side

[08:47]
so like I think it was more mental side
for him to try to make uh live around
him better
okay that's very interesting so it was
more like he also gave sort of a
community service you could say to like

[09:01]
community service you could say to like
try to give kids a certain perspective
or an option a career path that they
could follow so they don't end up on the
streets
yes yes
this coach is there if you think about
back about this coach is there any

[09:15]
back about this coach is there any
specific teaching that stuck with you up
until today
uh yes that was like for example in
winter it's like Windows 20 minutes 25
degree we always had uh outside uh

[09:30]
degree we always had uh outside uh
trains so we was playing on the snow and
stuff like that and he always was like
uh
I don't know how to say it like we never
got called from that it was pretty good
for our health and also he was um uh he

[09:48]
for our health and also he was um uh he
never tried to hold players like uh when
I started to play a bit better than
other players in team he told me a few
options in our teams where I can go
I can never try to hold us uh with him

[10:02]
I can never try to hold us uh with him
he always was like if you can go
somewhere and it will be good for you
you can go
it seems like a very good guy to to have
around so he was clearly having your
best interest in mind not necessarily

[10:15]
best interest in mind not necessarily
his best interest in terms of gathering
good players around him
yes yes he was like it's not only gosh
he was like Guru for us I don't know how
to say it correctly yeah you know I
understand
he always was like open for

[10:30]
he always was like open for
conversations he always was asking uh
about our mood about our living about he
always was telling us like even if you
like football very much you need to
think about school you need to teach

[10:45]
think about school you need to teach
well learn well you don't need to ignore
school because football is hard you
might not get in professional teams and
you need to be educated so like here he

[11:01]
you need to be educated so like here he
always put us on first place
personalities
but it seems like a great guy to to to
have around starting at a young age you
you mentioned you wasn't really sure why
you liked football so much I've heard

[11:15]
you liked football so much I've heard
that coaches say like some players are
more a coach on the pitch you know they
really think about the game
strategically but you also mentioned you
know if you were by yourself you would
just be doing tricks and stuff do you
think it was also like the Strategic
aspect of of football that attracted you

[11:31]
aspect of of football that attracted you
so much yeah yeah definitely it's like
it's very complicated game and uh
I like the like trying to do something
uh something hard

[11:45]
uh something hard
in uh football like hard tricks uh hard
shots but it's not always Market but I
practiced it a lot to do something
it's like it's always interesting to me
to make some goal and try to learn it

[12:03]
to make some goal and try to learn it
like go fur further and further in that
so you already had a sort of reflecting
mentality then from that young age what
is something that that coach also taught
you like okay you did well but how can

[12:16]
you like okay you did well but how can
you improve was it something that you
naturally had like okay I'm looking I
now made this goal or now made this
trick but how can I do it better next
time was that something that this coach
taught you or was it something that
already came natural to you or maybe
someone else
I think it was natural in me and I I

[12:32]
I think it was natural in me and I I
can't even imagine from where I had it
like
I had almost all of my life maybe from
some books like our brain works like
really strange like we can uh learn

[12:48]
really strange like we can uh learn
something pretty long
and don't understand it well but
sometimes we can just see some words and
book or some conversation in film and
like some conversation in real life and

[13:01]
like some conversation in real life and
it will hit our heart and uh like
improve our way
so I can't remember from where I get it
but somehow I was just trying to improve
yeah it could be as easy as you watch

[13:15]
yeah it could be as easy as you watch
the cartoon when you were little you
cannot remember it consciously but
unconsciously you know that made an
impact on you it was like oh so this is
how you improve you know it's like what
you said the mind the mind has a weird
way everything you get in gets a place
somewhere unconsciously or consciously

[13:31]
somewhere unconsciously or consciously
and yeah that kind of forms your your
character
yeah but like also it didn't work for me
everywhere like in school
uh I was I was improving only if it was

[13:45]
uh I was I was improving only if it was
interesting for me
so like uh in some parts of my education
like if someone didn't inspire me it was
almost unreal to me to improving in that
because I easily getting bored and like

[14:00]
because I easily getting bored and like
like okay it's boring I don't want to do
this and it's like it's super hard for
me to doing something what I don't like
yeah I think many many players can can
relate to that right the the focus that

[14:16]
relate to that right the the focus that
we suddenly have for a video game or
football or for poker it's completely
different than the focus we had at
school where they were just teaching us
stuff that they thought we should learn
but that wasn't necessarily we weren't
necessarily intrigued by by the lesson

[14:31]
necessarily intrigued by by the lesson
so your teachers were not like your
football coach that you were like oh wow
I really look up to this guy this is
something I can learn from those
teachers you didn't have in your
education yeah most of them wasn't like
that yes like I

[14:46]
that yes like I
think only a teacher of History was like
that and I liked history a lot and maybe
a
maybe literature but nothing more
so if you take something very serious
did you then notice at some point that

[15:02]
did you then notice at some point that
maybe the joy for football will become a
little bit less if you were forced to
play too much or you think your coach in
this case also made sure that everyone
had the right balance between improving
but still having fun in the game

[15:16]
but still having fun in the game
yeah it's like in in everything it's
easy to burn out or to like
get very close to you to your cap gap of
your skills and then you like uh easily

[15:31]
your skills and then you like uh easily
losing motivation because you think uh
it's super hard to go over over the gap
and it's like you need to spend
unrealistically a lot of time to get

[15:46]
unrealistically a lot of time to get
better and it's most hard thinking uh
like in life I think to recognize can
you do this or not but most of the time
if you're still enjoying what you're

[16:00]
if you're still enjoying what you're
doing you just you just keep going you
don't stop on this line because you're
like okay maybe it will work maybe not I
will just go
and you also I guess just enjoy you
enjoy the challenge I assume as well

[16:16]
enjoy the challenge I assume as well
yes yes of course
so you went uh you then transitioned
into
video games correct mainly playing
Warcraft and DOTA you wrote down how did

[16:30]
Warcraft and DOTA you wrote down how did
you get in touch with that when did you
decide to move from the football pitch
to yeah indoors to play video games was
it the -25 that you were like okay I'm
tired of playing in minus 25 football
weather let's play video games it was

[16:45]
weather let's play video games it was
like
uh there was in the time was pretty
uh popular internet cafe on Russia
because uh like very low amount of
people had PC at home and the internet

[17:00]
people had PC at home and the internet
at home uh and I started to missing
school a lot with friends we go to
internet cafe play Counter-Strike uh uh
Warcraft and our games and like this was
period of my life when I didn't like at

[17:16]
period of my life when I didn't like at
school at all I started to miss it
really a lot and I was just going to
internet cafe because it's like it's a
best place where you can't get count
because if you go to play football
somewhere someone see you they know what

[17:32]
somewhere someone see you they know what
you not seek or something like that and
you will have drug problems so easiest
way was go to internet cafe and then I
started to play uh video games and uh I

[17:47]
started to play uh video games and uh I
like it Warcraft very much because it
was very complex and hard game too and
it was super competitive there was like
big ladder and I started to play a lot
of that and I I didn't was so pretty

[18:03]
of that and I I didn't was so pretty
good at work after I maybe was like in
top thousands of ladder or something
like that and uh but still was
interesting to play but then why my
friends shot me Dota and I started to

[18:15]
friends shot me Dota and I started to
play this much more
all right all right so what what is it
about then the the Strategic games like
Doda and Warcraft that attracted you
more for example you could have also
played FIFA indoors right stick with
football but what is it then about

[18:30]
football but what is it then about
Warcraft and DOTA that attracts you so
much more than other type of games
uh you know I think it's uh because uh
it's more complicated like uh
it's clearly strategic games and you

[18:47]
it's clearly strategic games and you
need to think a lot about what you're
doing uh like one friend of mine he's uh
played DOTA a lot and he is also a great
chess player Ian nipponishi uh and he

[19:00]
chess player Ian nipponishi uh and he
told what like this there is a lot of
similarities between DOTA and chess he
was like even saying what DOTA is new
chess uh so yeah I think it's like it's
interesting games to play it's pretty
ties your brain like I didn't I wasn't

[19:15]
ties your brain like I didn't I wasn't
thinking about that when I played it
that times I was just playing because
they're having fun but uh when I watch
on that from retrospective I just
thinking what I always was looking for
something to keep my mind working

[19:31]
something to keep my mind working
because when I stopped to go to school
and uh also I like when I stopped to
play football I was dreaming and like
was living pretty bad life you can say

[19:46]
was living pretty bad life you can say
uh but um
uh from young age I uh was reading a lot
so I was like my mind was ready to new
information and even when I was drinking

[20:01]
information and even when I was drinking
and doing some random stuff outside it
was trying to keep busy maybe because of
that I was attracted by computer games
just to get something uh hard for my
mind

[20:15]
mind
something interesting for my mind and
then in in our questioner before the pot
we always ask that question as well how
easy was school for you and you you
wrote down very very easy so there was
school was not an environment in which
your brain got stimulated to learn and
therefore you looked for external things

[20:31]
therefore you looked for external things
like football like video games uh to to
kind of find that challenge so you could
actually bother to try basically yeah I
think I was good like until
like 13 years I think at school it was

[20:48]
like 13 years I think at school it was
uh had very good so
results there but uh then like I had a
couple of strategies in my life my
mother died and like it was very hard
times in Russia uh so I was just

[21:03]
times in Russia uh so I was just
I was always almost always in pretty bad
mood it was hard times mentally for me
and I just was looking for some place
where I can be like not in life like not

[21:17]
where I can be like not in life like not
here something like that I think it was
plain reason why I stopped to go to
school because I didn't want to be
somewhere whereas a lot of people and
when people forcing me to do what I

[21:30]
when people forcing me to do what I
don't want to do
and I was just trying to find like some
sort of peace and silence for myself
like of course I I didn't recognize it
then but I just can't say it back on the
time when I'm watching from now
and then times yeah so it's kind of like

[21:47]
and then times yeah so it's kind of like
you go to this internet cafe to this
community there and everyone is just
focused on the gaming and it's like a
whole cyber world where you can just
sort of forget about life outside of
that yeah yeah definitely yes
very interesting you you mentioned that

[22:02]
very interesting you you mentioned that
through the cyber world so probably
through this internet cafes you also got
into touch with poker this is where you
first got into touch with poker was it
something someone within the DOTA
environment or in the warcraft
environment that started to play poker

[22:16]
environment that started to play poker
and was like hey Victor we should go
play that game instead uh no it was like
uh a lot of uh games and uh daughter for
example was played on platform what
called gariana

[22:30]
called gariana
and uh I think Buckle was just very
paper at the time in in this Guyana you
can uh buy a premium account to get
access to some semi-private slot there
but have less players and work better

[22:46]
but have less players and work better
and you can make this account by payment
or by winning chips in poker for play
money so I was just playing poker to get
account mostly I was just like I didn't
really read rules almost I just was

[23:00]
really read rules almost I just was
blind the links from several accounts
somewhere I get enough balance and buy
premium it was like it was my first time
I played poker but also some yeah some
players from internet cafe and from

[23:15]
players from internet cafe and from
daughter community
uh started to play poker and I just
watch it in that like in chance to get
out from poor life
and uh like uh Russian DOTA Community

[23:30]
and uh like uh Russian DOTA Community
had like a few pretty good players
like antojis X dotta player he played
like 5K blues and like in that days it
was like 2013 or 2014 I think there was

[23:47]
was like 2013 or 2014 I think there was
already a bunch of players who played
like up to nl1k
yeah but I I first time I tried poker I
think in 2014 or something like that I
get uh

[24:00]
get uh
point of strategy fifty dollars
uh played and won something then lost it
and uh retired from Portugal again like
I just played two days and then decided
to
keep uh keep my daughter carrier

[24:17]
keep uh keep my daughter carrier
but
like in Dota it was a bit hard for me
because I can't go to learn events I was
like couple of times I was winning with
my team uh slot on some event in Sweden

[24:31]
my team uh slot on some event in Sweden
or something like that and I just can't
go they took someone instead of me they
go to play there they show okay results
some organization might even give them
contract but I like there was pointless

[24:47]
contract but I like there was pointless
to hold me on the team most of the time
and like when I heard this situation
like two or three times I was super
stressed and I decided to

[25:00]
stressed and I decided to
what I should finish my career and like
I played very last uh the alignment it
was like pretty big event back on the
days it was a big event and we like we
played in first division we lost there

[25:17]
played in first division we lost there
and I just killed daughter and decided
to try Poitier again I just downloaded
few poiker books it was like I decided
to play it online and so I I don't know
why I just I didn't was in touch with

[25:31]
why I just I didn't was in touch with
any poker players
so I decided what the lines is like more
competitive I downloaded a couple of
books like it was Jonathan little it was
Harrington and something like that and I
just started to reading these books and

[25:48]
just started to reading these books and
make notes because like I had I think
eighty dollars or something like that to
deposit and I understood what I don't
have a lot of chances so I just started

[26:00]
have a lot of chances so I just started
to studying before playing
but it's very interesting because most
people you know they just start playing
up poker and they kind of learn from
there but you realized from straight
away from the beginning like I need to
be careful with this 80 that I have I

[26:15]
be careful with this 80 that I have I
need to invest it well so let me first
study up on this game so I actually know
what I'm doing
yeah yes something like that it's very
very very responsible did you did you
find any similarities between playing
Warcraft DOTA and poker you mentioned

[26:31]
Warcraft DOTA and poker you mentioned
that your friends who played chess he
called DOTA like the new chest
could you call poker uh also like the
new the new DOTA new Warcraft are there
any similarities
uh yes like it's it's both strategic

[26:45]
uh yes like it's it's both strategic
game and uh
uh I
unlikely for me I understood it's pretty
late but uh this game both of these
games have very hard mental state
because like you you need to really be

[27:02]
because like you you need to really be
mentally prepared it was it was my
biggest mistake by far in poker because
I ignored mental side of Poker for a
long time like when I recognize it what
you need to work on your mental side I

[27:15]
you need to work on your mental side I
even started to text my friends from
DOTA like like this who I have friends
who playing can play it in viltus Pro in
one best of the Airlines and I started
to text him like bro you need you really

[27:30]
to text him like bro you need you really
need to say you need to hire
psychotherapist for your team you need
to work on this like you need to try
this because this like a very big
similarity between these games because
you need to be in very very good mental

[27:45]
you need to be in very very good mental
shape to have good results
I can imagine and this is the mainly
like what is it that is so challenging
about like I I don't have any experience
playing DOTA Warcraft but is it also
like the very inside of it
yes there are some side of variants of

[28:01]
yes there are some side of variants of
course and like uh
variants always uh hit more uh the more
opportunities you have and in daughter
you have a giant tree of opportunities
and you have five players on your side

[28:17]
and you have five players on your side
and five players on the other side so
like three is really big and uh there is
just casual uh variants like on some
routes or some some stuff like that
critical damage and our stuff but there

[28:32]
critical damage and our stuff but there
is also like hidden variants what like
some of your players might make mistake
because of something or you can make
mistake because of something like uh uh
you didn't watch data but uh like great

[28:46]
you didn't watch data but uh like great
example will be like last major
tournament when one Chinese team who is
like their Superstar they're very good
but on the grind finals they just killed
it they just killed it and left the game

[29:00]
it they just killed it and left the game
what they can play more and it's like
it's solid but it's a mental state and
uh both uh DOTA and poker it's like it
can snowball you it can like put you on
more and more and more pressure and you
need to practice a lot to not fall under

[29:17]
need to practice a lot to not fall under
that
you mentioned like the variance of for
example your teammate screwing up right
so DOTA you said you play five against
side so it's clearly a team a team team
effort how was it for you switching from

[29:31]
effort how was it for you switching from
like a team sport with football DOTA to
something way more individual like poker
it was super good for me because my very
last team was uh
it was free young guys like I was

[29:48]
it was free young guys like I was
20 for them unveil us like 16-17 and it
was
very hard to play with them because they
was super young super ambitious

[30:00]
was super young super ambitious
they was like there was a lot of absurd
things there like Russian uh daughter
teams it's super unprofessional in many
aspects like you know maybe some maybe
it will watch some people who understand
the DOTA so I will say just I even

[30:16]
the DOTA so I will say just I even
played uh one against one
versus my teammate to decide who will
play which position it's like it's total
absolute for professional team but we
had this because like this young guys

[30:30]
had this because like this young guys
was like talking too much we was talking
too much [ __ ] to the shower there was
like no supportive
uh site on our team like if we was
losing game we was always discussing who
played bad whose mistakes was more and

[30:47]
played bad whose mistakes was more and
something like that it was never like
okay guys we lost we need to practice we
need to be better it's always like oh
you're fighting the idiot you're in it
our game and stuff like that so like in
poker there is only one [ __ ] idiot

[31:03]
so yeah okay yeah so you you
it's it's easier because if you screw up
you can just point at yourself
uh yeah and I think what what it sounded
like there if someone screwed up they

[31:15]
like there if someone screwed up they
like to point at other people it also
sounds like there was a lot of ego
involved in this environment
yes of course it's like it's much much
further so did did I mean you have a lot
of experience with that
what kind of qualities do you think DOTA

[31:31]
what kind of qualities do you think DOTA
playing DOTA and Warcraft uh made you
develop that gave you an edge starting
off in poker
um
I think
first of all is discipline to practice

[31:45]
first of all is discipline to practice
and same think a lot
like in daughter you're playing like I
was playing in other it's more than 100
euros and some days I was like playing
just one hero straight every day like 10

[32:00]
just one hero straight every day like 10
blues games
so and it's like it's very needed skill
in poker to do same thing a lot and also
in DotA
if you're playing good you need to it's
uh

[32:16]
uh
you can look at game like it's very
casual style you can play DotA for fun
you can play semi-professional you can
play professional like there is a lot of
levels to dive deeper and I think it's
totally the same in poker like you can

[32:32]
totally the same in poker like you can
just bump hunt you can regular like a
lot of uh thing to go deeper and deeper
and deeper so you can just like uh
put your opponent on the hand you could
put your opponent on the Range you can

[32:46]
put your opponent on the Range you can
think like uh a lot deeper and poker and
it's like spread is similar to in DotA
interesting you also mentioned that both
in football and in video games you

[33:01]
in football and in video games you
looked for inspiring people yeah you had
this inspiring coach was there any
players specifically or someone who you
started playing poker with that inspired
you a lot you mentioned for example on
Doha maybe it was an example of someone
showing that you can be actually

[33:16]
showing that you can be actually
successful in poker
um
it's it's pretty funny because I
remember like uh
uh I started to follow to look for some

[33:30]
uh I started to follow to look for some
kitchen project in poker and baking and
there was like uh I invited to some team
and there was like a guy with results he
like won 1.50 gate his career uh

[33:46]
like won 1.50 gate his career uh
something like that he was so he was
like actually winning like 20K yearly
and I was showing his results to my
girlfriend who is my wife and was
telling like book yeah I can make that

[34:00]
telling like book yeah I can make that
much money if I will practice a lot so
it's funny what first what inspired me
in poker was someone who was making
money but now it was pretty fun like
when I was in Cyprus in Brighton series

[34:15]
when I was in Cyprus in Brighton series
and we was like people was having fun
from me because they play like
degenerate
and one guy told me like look uh this
guy he's playing poker like he playing
DOTA he totally don't give a [ __ ] about
anything and it's I think it's true like

[34:31]
anything and it's I think it's true like
I'm not playing poker for money but
first pink what inspired me when I came
to Poker was someone making money and
it's like it's pretty fun
because also you mentioned in football
already your coach kind of installed
this right that this could be a way out

[34:45]
this right that this could be a way out
so I think from a young age growing up
in Russia in the environment that you
grew up that was something that was
planted in you to think about like hey
think about safety you need to think
think about a way that you can make
money you mentioned it were tough times
so it makes sense that you saw poker as

[35:01]
so it makes sense that you saw poker as
an opportunity to make money but when
you start to make money like the
competitive gamer in you took over and
was like oh how can I improve what is
the next level what is the next level
and then you don't give a [ __ ] about
money anymore
yeah yeah something like that

[35:17]
yeah yeah something like that
um you started out you said you started
up playing mpts because you thought I
think I think you mentioned that you
thought that that was more competitive
why did you decide to play entities
besides was that purely because that was
your perception or was that that for

[35:32]
your perception or was that that for
example the examples that you had were
playing tournaments as well
oh no I just I was just thinking it's
more competitive and more interesting
but it wasn't it was big mistake yeah so

[35:45]
but it wasn't it was big mistake yeah so
so it was interesting uh what what made
it so interesting about it why was it a
big mistake in hindsight uh
uh because cash is much better I I mean
mpts is fun to play I still love to play

[36:00]
mpts is fun to play I still love to play
into this I still love to play life and
it is more than live cash much more
but um
an MTD
it's I think it's like more boring
comparing to cash and also

[36:16]
comparing to cash and also
and also if I find out what it's less
competitive because on MTG you like
the only loss of entity what you can win
it in cash game you can you can't win

[36:30]
it in cash game you can you can't win
you don't have end point and in the
alignment you haven't point you win the
lime and Tower you good in case game you
don't have it but on the other side like
cash and cash much more interesting
because even like because it's deeper

[36:46]
because even like because it's deeper
you have more opportunities to move to
do something
it's interesting because most probably
if I speak to a lot of entity players
they actually call Cash games boring
right they say ah it's so static blah
blah blah uh how do you like why do you

[37:01]
blah blah uh how do you like why do you
because in in tournaments there is a lot
of interesting phases right to have
different phases during the tournament
you have different strategies Stacks get
shorter then you have ICM Etc so I think
a lot of players would actually make the
argument that entities or cash games is

[37:16]
argument that entities or cash games is
way less boring but what makes cash less
boring for you than tournaments it's uh
it depends on how you watch if you match
like which is like wider and reduces
wider a lot more more spots and but uh

[37:33]
wider a lot more more spots and but uh
cash game is much deeper than indities
because you can like you can think
pretty deep there is like more trees
what you can use uh there is more sizes

[37:45]
what you can use uh there is more sizes
you can use like uh you can have much
more tricks in your pocket and in empty
this like if you go 20 or less big
blinds deep you like you can't go
something crazy without burning your

[38:01]
something crazy without burning your
money
and it's like uh and also ICM like a lot
of
shallow Stacks HCM it's uh things what
um
handle you from doing something
interesting you like you have just

[38:18]
interesting you like you have just
opportunity to play correct or burn
money and in cash games when you play
like 100 deep blinds deep and you play
three-handed or heads up so range is

[38:30]
three-handed or heads up so range is
wide uh you can try to do some exploit
things and even if it's not very good
it's hard to make super big regret if
you're not going like totally out of
line think

[38:46]
line think
and it's like it's giving much more
space to improve I think
and then I guess also it has it has it
has two sides right yeah like you said
in ICM you can either screw up or play
correct whereas in the environment that

[39:00]
correct whereas in the environment that
you described like 300 big Blends cache
you have actually an opportunity to do
something very good right whereas in ICM
and in tournaments with shorter Stacks
often you're a bit handcuffed and you're
kind of restricted what you can do yeah
the guy goes all in and you can either

[39:15]
the guy goes all in and you can either
make the correct play or make or make
sort of a blunder by folding a certain
hand that you should call for example
calling a certain to use a fault but
other than that that's it right yeah
you're just a bit more handcuffed so
that's kind of what makes it a bit
boring for you yeah yeah

[39:30]
boring for you yeah yeah
so you then saw the light at some point
after playing entities for two years you
switched into Cash games any um do you
recall any difficulties because I'm sure
you yeah you adapt to certain habits
that worked well in mtps were there

[39:45]
that worked well in mtps were there
certain things you had to unlearn when I
play cash games right I can say like
uh maybe uh like uh I was pretty unlike
in a lot of periods of my calendar I had

[40:00]
in a lot of periods of my calendar I had
huge downswings but I was very extremely
lucky in people around me like I
switched to cash games because I uh I
meet one guy from rostov who played
poker he played cash and um we like hang

[40:17]
poker he played cash and um we like hang
out a few times uh when he told me what
he have
he apartment rate what he was finishing
rent and uh we decided to leave some
time together so he moved to my house

[40:32]
time together so he moved to my house
and we played sit into each hour he
played cash I was playing kimchi this uh
and this guy was Stefan actually like he
played an L200 in that time and every
day he was telling dude stop stop

[40:46]
day he was telling dude stop stop
playing this [ __ ] game go play cash
like it's much better it's much better
he was playing snap 200 on edited at
times
and like uh he was forcing me to try to
play cash I played like a couple of

[41:00]
play cash I played like a couple of
sessions and I found what it is it's
interesting so like he forced me to
change discipline uh then like second
time what I get super lucky I uh go with
friends to Cyprus
it was Gypsy team Poker series like uh

[41:18]
it was Gypsy team Poker series like uh
made by a Russian Forum biker Forum uh I
played there's some cash games I play it
Santo lineman there and then uh that

[41:30]
Santo lineman there and then uh that
time was going got the international its
biggest data to alignment uh so I
decided to take laptop and go watch this
alignment on Lobby on big TV and guys
joined it to me we started to have

[41:46]
joined it to me we started to have
conversation and this was like invoker
and one guy who was crashing Zoom 500
and then walk here in that times he was
like holding Lobby of 5K plus and we
where we started to hang out and he
uh uh I I back home he invited me to

[42:03]
uh uh I I back home he invited me to
play DotA uh I joined party and uh
antoch had joined it out party and I
recognized what I know him for like
seven years or something like that so
they uh give me caution so like I was in

[42:18]
they uh give me caution so like I was in
the in that way I was super lucky there
was just uh most
most of the time I had some people who
was always ready to help me to give me

[42:33]
was always ready to help me to give me
some explanation of what I'm I can do
but uh also I think it's a pretty good
to say I was never
go over the Trust on me so I never was

[42:47]
go over the Trust on me so I never was
spamming like every hand I play I never
was like trying to get a lot of
attention from there
I was always trying to like
I think what I can do something in poker

[43:00]
I think what I can do something in poker
like some strategy I play a lot of hands
doing this and I came to to them with
like big text of my idea and examples I
never was just asking them to give me
something I was trying to uh

[43:16]
something I was trying to uh
help me to find the way how to improve
because it's like
it's uh one of my big problems with when
you're communicating with people because
some people just trying to
uh get a lot from you without putting

[43:34]
uh get a lot from you without putting
their own work
and it's like I think it's big mistake
for both sides
and I think also especially if you like
I used to say the the quality of a

[43:45]
I used to say the the quality of a
coaching session for example if someone
wants to do a coaching session with me
like the quality of how how valuable
that coaching session is going to be is
depending on the questions that he's
going to ask and if you explain to in
this case I'm DOA invoke or Stefan which
is quite an impressive lineup uh if you

[44:02]
is quite an impressive lineup uh if you
give them your thoughts they can
actually correct you at a very uh
important point in your thought process
he says hey this strategy works really
well only you're missing really one
important thing and then they can add so
much value because you asked the right

[44:16]
much value because you asked the right
question because you lay down your
thoughts right so they cannot correct
you on the play that you made but on the
underlying uh thought process behind
your actual strategy which is going to
be so much more valuable do you still

[44:30]
be so much more valuable do you still
remember like one big aha moment you had
with either one of these three where you
filled out the whole [ __ ] like hey guys
I'm approaching like this is my strategy
do you recall one big aha moment where
one of these three guys gave you
feedback like hey if you want to

[44:45]
feedback like hey if you want to
progress to to the high stakes and play
with us this is something that that you
have to correct
like one of these moments I remember one
super funny moment uh when I was like
falling asleep it was like two hours a

[45:00]
falling asleep it was like two hours a
night and then dog has started to call
me at Skype
uh I took the call and he like instantly
started screaming called me ah you
[ __ ] you you think I didn't see this
and he showed me some hand what I played

[45:16]
and he showed me some hand what I played
from our player database who he was
teaching and he was like total random
clicking by me and he was like why you
didn't show me that hand you played this
like super garbage and it was like
supervisor he like found in in our

[45:30]
supervisor he like found in in our
players database can't play play me
super bad
and start like uh treating me but it was
like they had I think like 15 maybe
20-year players collection group
and uh they was uh I don't know I still

[45:48]
and uh they was uh I don't know I still
don't know it was trolling or not but
Ray was telling what they trying to like
uh make from me Butler who will play in
like lower Stakes than than their uh

[46:02]
like lower Stakes than than their uh
with players against who they play like
for example like they've played five cup
plus with some guys since this guy is
playing Tucan in 2K and I will like uh
play in 2K against these guys a lot

[46:16]
play in 2K against these guys a lot
something like that but they was
understanding what I will anyway go to
play like like that against anyone or
something like that
was there any uh big contribution that

[46:31]
was there any uh big contribution that
you think you made to their game where
there were there any times where you
send it over this document with your
with your thoughts that they were like
hi this is actually very good I'm we're
actually going to implement this in our
own game as well
yeah yeah there was some like uh good

[46:46]
yeah yeah there was some like uh good
ideas but I bring it to them uh like
some sorts of uh spam super small
sizings uh something like that but on
that days
um I was just I I can't even remember

[47:02]
um I was just I I can't even remember
what I was bringing to them because I
was
like thinking too much I think I was
thinking too much about strategy and I
wasn't thinking about mental science so
I like I had a lot of uh trying to play

[47:17]
I like I had a lot of uh trying to play
different styles I was switching my
strategy too often
like
I had even like paired when I played in
Zoom 200 with
fall to free but like 17 or something

[47:31]
fall to free but like 17 or something
like that
yes one seven okay yes and like uh and I
was still like winning like 12 big
blinds Red Line something like that and

[47:46]
blinds Red Line something like that and
losing on blue line so like had a lot of
different strategists and I think now I
think every strategy from that was uh
pretty bad almost everything something
was uh a bit close to what Stefan doing

[48:00]
was uh a bit close to what Stefan doing
now
could you maybe maybe give an example of
something obviously throughout my career
I've experimented with various things a
lot of things indeed didn't stick
especially also I think you started when
you started there were already solvers
or no oh yes yes it was solvers I was

[48:20]
or no oh yes yes it was solvers I was
working in that but uh I was always
thinking what exploit will work better
before the time when I started to be

[48:30]
before the time when I started to be
extremely paranoid what people will
start to exploit me back
okay because because I remember for
example I started playing way before
solvers as well so you were just trying
out things and then when Silvers came
out it turned out certain things were
indeed GTO yeah they know that they were

[48:46]
indeed GTO yeah they know that they were
approved and certain things weren't and
as you mentioned there were certain
things that in hindsight were actually
very good in certain majority of things
weren't that good what was one of these
things that indeed you still do today or
things that Stefan is doing today that

[49:00]
things that Stefan is doing today that
you'll be like hey yes we came up with
that a long time ago
yeah I think one of this thing is like
uh adding to your bluff wrench uh random
unblock your hands it's like it's think
what soldier sounds also do like for Big

[49:16]
what soldier sounds also do like for Big
Blocks you like with some frequency you
have like hands but uh don't have almost
don't have Equity have unblockers and uh
it's um
it's only not not only correct play

[49:30]
it's only not not only correct play
because of solver it's also a good play
from uh like uh image side because when
people seeing what you Bluff in like
totally random hand they might uh
understand your Ranch wrong in that spot

[49:46]
understand your Ranch wrong in that spot
at all and it's super good
okay interesting so and like the reasons
behind it were for example I might have
done certain things in the past and that
the solver also did it but I did it for
wrong wrong reasons but I ended up

[50:01]
wrong wrong reasons but I ended up
making the right play what was it the
same in this case or you were
consciously thinking about no I'm
unblocking the folding range so you know
this makes a good Barrel even though I
don't have Equity because back in that
time Equity was like you know the
standard oh I'm starting play like

[50:15]
standard oh I'm starting play like
little late enough to
I I always had some Soldier practicing
when I play it like even when I started
attemptive solvers was in already so
uh and I was

[50:30]
uh and I was
uh my first time I was more focused on
flab01 solvers because I was telling
this to everyone who I coach what I
still think what uh you always need to
start work with flabzilla Institute of

[50:45]
start work with flabzilla Institute of
solvers because when you put everything
manually
you remember better
your brain uh like uh more attracted to
think what you do and you will use it

[51:00]
think what you do and you will use it
more easier later so you like always
need to do as much manual process as you
can
that's actually a very good point what
what would be something that you were
doing in flopzilla
uh I was just

[51:16]
uh I was just
um uh doing a lot of uh
work to see how
um
how dark and River cards affects ranges
uh and how ranges work and was it was

[51:30]
uh and how ranges work and was it was
like it helped me to understand some
solar things like uh for example uh
donkey on super Blanc in like uh like uh
something like Ace X6 board you're

[51:46]
something like Ace X6 board you're
playing check call darn this Deuce of of
suit and solder is starting to lead from
big blind and like working with
flopzilla helped me to understood why
it's happened just because like uh open

[52:00]
it's happened just because like uh open
razor can bet almost full range you
check call not full range and on the
black turn your range of two column is a
head of range of bed
and like if I never use Club 0 it will
be much harder for me to understand
things like this I think just because

[52:17]
things like this I think just because
with flops you I was just
I do I I like I did a lot there I was uh
reviewing hands there I was reviewing
cow ranch uh play against Ranch on
different type of textures I I don't

[52:32]
different type of textures I I don't
remember where I found but I had some
like text files with this uh persons of
how often uh different board textures
appears something like that like top 10
uh of board textures

[52:45]
uh of board textures
and I was just to work and with
different ranges on the textures and uh
put it my tools on text file and it
helped me a lot to understand how Equity
uh changes on different runouts on

[53:02]
uh changes on different runouts on
different situations how it floats
yeah you you became very range aware it
seems and obviously if you arrange aware
like the ranges and the equities the
equity distribution obviously is a Big

[53:15]
equity distribution obviously is a Big
Driver behind certain strategies right
the range setup is in a certain way like
ux AI like you explained on the ASAP
board yeah he see that range check
calling generates a certain Advantage
therefore we don't have air you can have
air and we dunk out this is a
consequence of understanding the

[53:31]
consequence of understanding the
mechanics behind it where I think a lot
of new school players who just try to
copy the solver they're not they they
start with the end products whereas you
start with the mechanics right you start
in the beginning and that leads you to
think like okay well if this is how the
game works then the strategical

[53:46]
game works then the strategical
consequence must be that we will have a
dunk there whereas people who thought or
learned poker before that they might
have learned like yeah you always check
towards the Razer it's just a roux which
works most of the time but then you know
you you don't if you don't understand

[54:00]
you you don't if you don't understand
why we're checking towards the razor
right which is because of the equities
the the range distributions you don't
know when the exception will actually
occur
yeah it's also like um
what I wanted to say

[54:15]
what I wanted to say
uh I think it's much better to like
spend 10 hours on one spot when spend 10
hours on 10 spots like most of the time
just because
uh

[54:30]
uh
you need not not unique like I think
it's much better to try and to
understand what solve you're doing what
he's doing except of just uh to remember
like what to do because if you're trying

[54:45]
like what to do because if you're trying
to understand what the machine doing you
will
play better in sports what you never
solved
yeah because you're trying to learn for
you're trying to learn why it's doing

[55:00]
you're trying to learn why it's doing
what it's doing and if you understand
the mechanism behind that play you will
also translate that knowledge into a
future spot which you haven't looked up
but given the fact that you know the
mechanics behind the game you you've
studied in for example flop zero the the
equity Distribution on the board like

[55:15]
equity Distribution on the board like
this and you know what kind of
strategical consequence an equity
distribution like that will have
yeah yeah
and also it's it's makes uh
uh if you're studying like this I think

[55:30]
uh if you're studying like this I think
it makes Parker more interesting because
if you're just trying to remember
something
um it's not super cool but if you're
trying to understand something it's like
uh

[55:46]
uh
[Music]
they don't know the word like you're
just trying to watch on different sides
you you put much more brain work to that
and it's like
uh you can also have can have

[56:03]
uh you can also have can have
uh Happy from from yourself if you find
correct answer because if you just
remembering something it's okay
okay you did the work but if you find
the answer to question what you was

[56:17]
the answer to question what you was
looking for you got your dopamine and
you got happy because you think okay
maybe I'm smart maybe I'm not an idiot
like after watching on same like screen

[56:31]
like after watching on same like screen
for like 15 hours and then you oh yeah
now I understand what it what uh so
you're gonna do this and you start to
feel yourself better
yeah and I think this approach also
allows for more strategical creativity

[56:46]
allows for more strategical creativity
right because if you understand why then
you also understand the why not so you
can actually adjust in various spots
which makes it very satisfying
yeah yeah I mean
uh if you if you're doing this you can

[57:00]
uh if you if you're doing this you can
like
I think amplifies correct but you can
amplify how it will change if you are to
do some logs if you are these some
different ranges something like that you
will be like uh

[57:15]
will be like uh
easier to move
like Stefan is pretty good example he
like sometimes he can do something just
because he want to do it like you don't
give a [ __ ] he he breaks you quickly
recognize
uh words sight of what he's doing and if

[57:34]
uh words sight of what he's doing and if
he understands what it's not will be
it's not be terrible he will try just
because he curious to do it and I think
it's pretty good like I and most of the

[57:46]
it's pretty good like I and most of the
time I'm like doing the same if if I
wanna just try something
I can like spend a bit of time to
understand what it can be super bad and
if it's can't I okay I can do some EV

[58:00]
if it's can't I okay I can do some EV
mistake but I try and I will see result
and uh it will it can can help me later
like a friend of mine with Skype the
work most of the diamond Theory uh he

[58:15]
work most of the diamond Theory uh he
told funny thing like yeah he thought I
can never station people on uh big pots
because they can just review your
database and see the ranges
because like
if I want to call a call

[58:32]
if I want to call a call
that's true that that's usually how it
goes

now without further Ado let's get back

[1:00:45]
now without further Ado let's get back
into more goodness in today's episode
so you you
you've kind of walked through how you
switch from empties to cash and how you
kind of walk through uh yeah basically
your journey that was always very

[1:01:00]
your journey that was always very
important that you have people around
you right that that helped you yeah that
was a very very big contributor uh Adam
I know you've been silently waiting on
the sideline uh I think this is a a

[1:01:15]
the sideline uh I think this is a a
habit of successful people or a pattern
with successful people right that they
that they don't try to do it alone
yeah I think it's a very uh common Trend
we see where successful people very
often find their way to be around the
right people and as Victor was speaking

[1:01:31]
right people and as Victor was speaking
there it's very often a very uh
um good relationship for both ends where
you're not just sponging off people
you're actually contributing a lot when
you were speaking there Victor I could
tell the people who were around you were
probably gaining as much as they were
given and so even you're maybe below

[1:01:46]
given and so even you're maybe below
somebody on your journey you still need
to be contributing to uh to their kind
of their success over time so yeah I
think you found the right people at the
right time to encourage you to learn
from and yeah it seems to be a very
common thread line on our podcast that's
people who make the top often don't do

[1:02:01]
people who make the top often don't do
it alone they find the right people and
that helps them a lot so as I was seeing
you were speaking of Victor I noticed a
trend of you uh seeking challenges that
you want to do hard things and what's
came across to me listening was that you
like to pick your own challenges so uh

[1:02:15]
like to pick your own challenges so uh
for school maybe not you don't pick the
kind of learner path but for the games
you're playing and poker it was
enjoyable for you because you seeked
your own Challenge and you you basically
directed where you are going you
mentioned that poker in games in
particular keep your mind working and if

[1:02:30]
particular keep your mind working and if
it's interesting and complicated you
find it challenge you find it rewarding
so for you when things are complicated
why do you feel like you like that
because most people do the opposite it's
like wow that's complicated let me do
the easy stuff but for you A lot of the
things you were speaking about you seek

[1:02:45]
things you were speaking about you seek
complication and try to solve that so
why do you feel like that's enjoyable
for you
yeah if you like it's so it's just
always interesting to uh
see how far you can go somewhere and

[1:03:00]
see how far you can go somewhere and
also when you trying this a lot trying
to find your your top uh you just
starting to ignore like part of
challenge you just going to do something

[1:03:15]
challenge you just going to do something
because you uh a lot of times try to hit
your top like as I said I was practicing
same hero a lot and DOTA uh I was trying
to practice same tricks a lot in
football

[1:03:30]
football
and a time when I started to play poker
I like I don't even
most of the time I don't even think
about challenges is like a challenge I
just I was doing this because it's
interesting like for example I started

[1:03:47]
interesting like for example I started
to play cash like probably in late 2016
and in 2017 there was a master's league
on Stars it was like two limits until
200 and an l2k and uh it was a react

[1:04:05]
200 and an l2k and uh it was a react
games only without Drake with
leaderboard and uh I didn't I didn't
even waste the time to think do I want
to play it or not I just started to

[1:04:15]
to play it or not I just started to
Green to this every day and I I want
smallest small one to 100 and I was
playing this just because it's
interesting
um
and I I never made any public challenge

[1:04:30]
and I I never made any public challenge
because I think it's like uh it I don't
need extra pressure for myself so I was
like always if I try and do something I
maybe discuss this with friends
but I never trying to find something

[1:04:46]
but I never trying to find something
some side bets or something to I was
understanding because I can improve my
UV because of it like for example in
2020 I was thinking to challenge to play
one point five million Health on 1K plus

[1:05:04]
one point five million Health on 1K plus
but I like I decided what it's we will
be very bad idea to make public
Challenge and also I failed it like in
September I played
uh almost million hands but I decided to

[1:05:18]
uh almost million hands but I decided to
stop challenge because I was too tired
so I can tell you somebody who likes to
follow your interests and that very
often leads you into challenges you also
describe yourself in a questionnaire as

[1:05:30]
describe yourself in a questionnaire as
a bit of a gambler at heart so you've
got someone who your kind of character
traits are generally going to lead you
to take on a bit more risk than the
average person which brings us to the
time when you were aggressively reg War
into five kids on a 70k roll which led
you to go broke and have to rebuild your

[1:05:46]
you to go broke and have to rebuild your
role so could you tell us a bit about
that period of time what was your kind
of thoughts going into uh that shot
ticket five kids when you started reg
war with uh your 70k roll
yeah it was like uh so I switched it to

[1:06:01]
yeah it was like uh so I switched it to
cash games I started to play from
greatly from now 200. I beat it Zoom 200
I was playing like uh like first thing
like we from what I need to start it was
uh what I was fully in poker I was

[1:06:16]
uh what I was fully in poker I was
playing at least 10 hours daily and our
time I spent to hand review or to
educating so like you know while my
timer was spent in computer

[1:06:30]
timer was spent in computer
it was like I think it was at least uh
250 hours every month at biker something
like that so and
in that time I was uh in group with uh
invoice in collection group I beat it

[1:06:48]
invoice in collection group I beat it
until now 200 uh I once this starts
challenge
I started to play an l1k A bit uh it was
work well too and I

[1:07:00]
work well too and I
uh took third place in some life event
and such it was CPT or something like
that a small one one cable in uh so I it
was first time when I get a decentral

[1:07:15]
was first time when I get a decentral
because before that I played uh in uh
baking project and mdts and like I was
spending gold money to
have better life because I had like
I started to in pretty bad

[1:07:31]
I started to in pretty bad
[Music]
in in bad life so I was spending no
money and it was first time when I had
some role and I just
I probably I didn't understand how hard

[1:07:46]
I probably I didn't understand how hard
it will be to make it back so I just go
I tried I was in it was interesting to
me to play 5K and I just decided to take
a shot I lost like a couple of binds

[1:08:00]
a shot I lost like a couple of binds
there not much
uh but uh
uh biggest problem on that was what as I
told my mental part of working was
pretty big like for a pretty long of

[1:08:15]
pretty big like for a pretty long of
time I was thinking about all what you
need to do in poker you just play better
and if you will play very good
all will be fine I was ignoring select
always I was playing to many friends
hours too I was playing like

[1:08:31]
hours too I was playing like
a lot of time I played uh four table
Zoom 200 and 3 tables up to 100 so it's
actually was like seven table in Zoom uh
which is not very good too and uh so I I

[1:08:46]
which is not very good too and uh so I I
didn't even recognize how crashed I felt
when I lost to these guys and then I go
to upt Barcelona
uh I play it without IGM I public Main

[1:09:00]
uh I play it without IGM I public Main
Event so I just decided to play it on K
without selling can you think
uh lost this played series with zero ATM
came back and have like maybe a 50k roll
or something like that and when I got

[1:09:17]
or something like that and when I got
huge downspin on Zoom 500 like uh
it was like nearly 80 miles under review
run which is I think it's like it's not
super rare for Zoom 500 because I never

[1:09:31]
super rare for Zoom 500 because I never
selected it I like if it run I play and
uh most of the time it was pretty bad
Zoom 500 so big downswing there or I
think it's pretty common

[1:09:45]
think it's pretty common
but I feel myself like pretty crushed in
that period
so it's always through that periods you
how do you rebuild so we've gone from
one stage to playing 5Ks and shot taking
I'm guessing that was a very exciting
time we've been studying OTB and other

[1:10:01]
time we've been studying OTB and other
players you're probably thinking rights
this is it this is the big break I'm
gonna play amongst the big boys and then
not long after you're grinding 500 zooms
and and you're losing 80 buy-ins and
your role is just going down and down so
over a short span of time we've gone
from On Top of the World shot ticket

[1:10:16]
from On Top of the World shot ticket
high stakes to uh wait a second where do
I build my role from so tell us through
that law point when you were 80 by his
beloved 500s how would you rebuild
yourself your confidence and what were
some of the issues you were facing
during that time
yeah I like it was do I did it like step

[1:10:34]
yeah I like it was do I did it like step
by step uh first I recognized what I
need to stop playing Zoom 500 and go
lower when after that and I go to EPT

[1:10:46]
lower when after that and I go to EPT
Prague
I uh this time myself
uh so this is for some tournaments uh I
play it with zero itm and there was the
alignment like
and 5K buy-in uh uh not gpg but uh yeah

[1:11:05]
and 5K buy-in uh uh not gpg but uh yeah
ipt series when it was played by Patrick
Walker and I was just going with friends
who is MPT Rex we go to that it's what's

[1:11:16]
who is MPT Rex we go to that it's what's
in in our Casino we go there uh they see
field and Fields like was super bad it
was like
80 or 90 players and like two
recreationals and something like that
and my friend joked like oh it's like
feels like you like like you laugh you

[1:11:31]
feels like you like like you laugh you
need to play this and they give me free
roll like uh I played for their money
for like 13 or something like that I
I finished at fifth five or something
like that so got like 50k here or

[1:11:46]
like that so got like 50k here or
something like that uh uh I put this
money into my roll and uh decided what I
need to play from someone's money I took
banking
uh it was like January or something like

[1:12:00]
uh it was like January or something like
that and until
probably like until August I was going
up and down like I some sometimes I was
feeling something I took this money for

[1:12:15]
feeling something I took this money for
Living so I wasn't building bankroll and
also
like I want something if you split money
then I go to zoom and I'm still playing
like seven tables so variance was like
insane they go up and down it was fun

[1:12:31]
insane they go up and down it was fun
because like I even uh solved some
conversations on a two plus two when
where some people was uh uh thinking
what I'm semi-fish and some of our
people was thinking what I am using KK

[1:12:45]
people was thinking what I am using KK
like because of my digital strategy uh
so and this time
it was like 2018 I first time recognized
what I need to start work on my mental
health so I found Psychotherapy and he

[1:13:03]
health so I found Psychotherapy and he
told me what like I was working with him
a lot and we recognized what my main
problem was what I am playing and I
almost don't have anything from that uh

[1:13:16]
almost don't have anything from that uh
just competition because I like I didn't
bout myself fall or something like that
I had like super old phone and then like
a friend of mine told me dude you
winning money in poker you're making

[1:13:30]
winning money in poker you're making
good money just okay if you can buy if
you don't want to buy I give you my
phone and like one of the first things
what my therapist told me what you
should go and buy something for yourself
to feel happier just to feel what you

[1:13:45]
to feel happier just to feel what you
playing for something not just for
competition
and also this period of time was uh
pretty hard because my wife was pregnant
we was waiting for kid uh and I read it
a lot of literature about uh state of

[1:14:01]
a lot of literature about uh state of
mind uh and uh from that time I decided
what I need to start to be more
professional I I decided to took break
for like one month I was just splitted

[1:14:17]
for like one month I was just splitted
like 60 of time I was working on mental
side forty percent of time I was working
on Theory and uh when I decided to start
to play zul 100 just to

[1:14:31]
to play zul 100 just to
play a bit weaker field to just feel
myself better from like crushing people
I even wasn't sure what I will crush but
I mean I was sure but I will crash but
uh

[1:14:45]
uh
in skill variance there and it from that
point it all worked well from me because
I crushed it zoom 100 with like 14 BB
something like that when I crashed the

[1:15:01]
something like that when I crashed the
zoom 500 for like one month when I moved
to finally I moved to regular tables and
uh solve good results there so like I
started to grind in uh end of of just

[1:15:16]
started to grind in uh end of of just
2018 after this break after I fixed my
mental problems and I finished it that
year at an l1k was shot in Canal today I
was still in baking but I was in big

[1:15:30]
was still in baking but I was in big
plus so I just decided to play until end
of the year and uh after a split I had
like 50k plus bundle something like that
like in 2019 I I had sun already I

[1:15:45]
like in 2019 I I had sun already I
decided to
just uh be a bit more calm to play a bit
less at least try play a bit less I was
uh and like it was still good for me
I just I just don't don't show how much

[1:16:02]
I just I just don't don't show how much
I need to play because I like from that
point I can tell about world my career
but maybe you have some questions I
don't know
yes it feels like a very interesting
part of your career which I want to just
reflect on so yeah you're basically shot

[1:16:16]
reflect on so yeah you're basically shot
taking these five kids to begin with and
at that time you thought it was just a
strategy game just play a good strategy
and everything will work out and as you
run into more problems you had the
self-aware awareness enough to realize
wait a second my mental game isn't good

[1:16:30]
wait a second my mental game isn't good
enough I'm playing too much volume I'm
I've got leaks in my approach to pocket
which is potentially holding me back and
what I really like about your story
there is it sounds like you were able to
problem solve it without the ego very
often like the ego gets involved and we
kind of build a constructive way we're

[1:16:46]
kind of build a constructive way we're
better than this we're a high stakes
player we shouldn't have to work through
this but it sounds like you just went
back down to say playing 200 NL kind of
rebuild you saw some help in a
psychologist to kind of get to the root
of your problems and you realize wait a
second mental game is what I've not been

[1:17:00]
second mental game is what I've not been
working on I've been doing all strategy
and that's now my league so you said you
went for a period of spending 60 of your
time on your mental game so yeah I'd
love to uh you to share with us what you
would do even during that time what were
some of the things that you were working
on in terms of your mental game
yeah it lasts I was reading books about

[1:17:17]
yeah it lasts I was reading books about
psychology I was working with secretary
best I started to meditate and uh yeah I
did a lot of this and then I understood
what like even uh reading some not uh

[1:17:32]
what like even uh reading some not uh
focus it on mental side literature it's
helping to you to just watch wider on
different things like as I as I don't
like like when we was talking about
entity and cash games I was talking

[1:17:45]
entity and cash games I was talking
about like MDT says why their cash is
deeper but uh you need to watch both
deep and white you know like you need to
not if you are super focused it might
sometimes be too hard to not

[1:18:01]
sometimes be too hard to not
you know start making mistakes on our
sites so I just decided I was just
reading like a lot about how brain works
uh how to fix this then I started just
to read random letters or just to

[1:18:16]
to read random letters or just to
put some foot for my brain which is not
pointer
for your entities
yeah it sounds like you had to go from a
bit of a gamer maybe a amateur
semi-professional attitude to treating
poker more professionally and you will

[1:18:31]
poker more professionally and you will
learn about the brain you started to
meditate more and to get a little
calmness I'm interested to hear how that
impacted your poker career what are some
of the changes you noticed during that
time when you're becoming more
professional and you'll work on your
mindset how would that transition into

[1:18:45]
mindset how would that transition into
your game
yeah I mean it helped me a lot it helped
me to recognize what helped me in poker
because like there is a lot of types of
inner motivation what uh helps poker

[1:19:01]
inner motivation what uh helps poker
players like some players play to
protect themselves to like better for
better life to get money some players
love challenges some players uh play

[1:19:15]
love challenges some players uh play
because they
um they wanna not like be famous just to
show people how good they are in
something and like my motivator like my

[1:19:30]
something and like my motivator like my
most motivator was inner angel I was
like uh trying to
Crush every enemy
I mean I was like I am still I still
love this it's it's pretty fun about
high stakes because a lot of a lot of

[1:19:47]
high stakes because a lot of a lot of
players have like same driver I think a
lot of players
like when we in same table we're enemies
and we are like can be friends in real
life like with Stefan for example we
have like huge trash talks while we're

[1:20:02]
have like huge trash talks while we're
playing we hate each hour in tables but
we are friends still friends
and like it's same story was some other
players
so I was like you did some reflecting
and you understood yourself better and

[1:20:16]
and you understood yourself better and
you become more of what's driving you
and yeah I think it's very common for
high stakes players often differ from
the rest of the Bookout worlds where a
lot of players want to make money have
success I would lead to their peer
groups and then when you get to a
certain level like yourself playing the

[1:20:30]
certain level like yourself playing the
very high stakes very often just being
the best being the best version of
yourself and challenge yourself against
really tough competition and singing who
comes out on top and I love that about
poker and about sport where you can be
very strong rivals in the context of

[1:20:45]
very strong rivals in the context of
Poker trash talking each other wanted to
beat each other but outside of Poker
doesn't mutual respect because you're
very similar personalities who want to
win you want to get better but in terms
of a sport environment or a poker
environment you guys clash and you want
to almost kill each other at the poker
tables but it's in a healthy way so I I

[1:21:00]
tables but it's in a healthy way so I I
like that I feel like it's a it's good
for yourself to have understood what
your driver was and once you've got
Clarity on that very often the path
becomes a lot easier in terms of what
you're trying to achieve so what were
some of the changes you made during that
time so anoa leads that point you were
playing a lot of volume you were seeing

[1:21:16]
playing a lot of volume you were seeing
a psychologist who was highlighting this
fact for you how do you differ your
approach to poker after finding out what
your inner motivation was
yeah just just naturally uh helped me to
better understand my weaker and my

[1:21:32]
better understand my weaker and my
better side sites like uh I was uh in
the start of this journey I was trying
to play less volume to like I was even
starting to try to bump hunt I was

[1:21:47]
starting to try to bump hunt I was
trying to skip rig wires but then I
understand but like uh big volume and
uh a lot of time playing and playing
tough lineups it thinks what uh it's my

[1:22:00]
tough lineups it thinks what uh it's my
best science it's things that I'm doing
well like I never had a super big win
rate like in
2019 when I fixed my problems I had
pretty big period of time when I had

[1:22:15]
pretty big period of time when I had
like eight or nine nine BB per hundred
but it was time when I was um
more I had nearly 50 50 of educate and
complaint
but uh most of the time I was just I

[1:22:31]
but uh most of the time I was just I
feel this time it was just preparing to
reflect more and to start grind again
like I was still 100 almost 100 percent
in poiker but I was like I Was preparing

[1:22:45]
in poiker but I was like I Was preparing
myself to hard times so I I will be more
familiar when it happened and also
in that time I was it was fun because I
have the good results in 2019 it was

[1:23:00]
have the good results in 2019 it was
like one of years where I almost didn't
have any big downswings uh it was like
pretty uh good graph uh but I was
extremely paranoid what people start to
exploiting me because I was I winning I

[1:23:16]
exploiting me because I was I winning I
was feeling red line I was the big
station a bit too much I needed I had to
like reflux and I decided what I need to
rebuild my strategy and also I was

[1:23:30]
rebuild my strategy and also I was
understanding what I want to grind a lot
and so I wanted to build strategy what I
can be sure what it's working so because
when you're playing like total exploit
you need to be super confident or you

[1:23:46]
you need to be super confident or you
will like feel yourself very bad in hard
times because you will think what you're
making too many stakes and you will need
to make a lot of
job in in your own hand review to

[1:24:00]
job in in your own hand review to
understand what you played well or not
and you will like steal this time from
an hour opportunities to education so I
decided to make like a challenge and uh
well to

[1:24:16]
well to
almost 12 2019 I was just rebuilding
strategy like at summer I think I played
like
60 or 70 hours for three months and
spent on education 500 hours or

[1:24:32]
spent on education 500 hours or
something like that
and like and then next year was as an
adult I played like almost million hands
on an l1k plus it was 2020.
and uh like I think what I must to say

[1:24:48]
and uh like I think what I must to say
we dealt we was talking about people who
told me like Stefan and Morgan
but my main supporter was my wife
because we had child this time and she's

[1:25:00]
because we had child this time and she's
doing every routine for me because like
as I told previously it's super hard for
me to doing something what I don't like
so like
you know and she doing everything paying
that side like she's
she's super

[1:25:15]
she's super
a lot of water very much yeah yeah
amazing it's okay to have a wife who
supports you in that way you know
obviously she's got the child to look
after her whilst you're playing poker
and to be there for you to uh make your
life easy so that you can do the things
that you're interested in which is
learning poker at a high level so it was

[1:25:31]
learning poker at a high level so it was
amazing to have that support at home and
I know a lot of people would gain a lot
of benefit from that what I really found
interesting from you sticking there was
you had a strategy that was working so
you were going for a very exploitative
style of player but you already started
to realize if you kept going down that

[1:25:46]
to realize if you kept going down that
route at some point you'll get
re-exploited and this got you a little
bit paranoid you could see it but at the
same time it got you to go deeper into
thinking how can I rebuild my strategy
you know as he was speaking it reminds
me of a Tiger Woods when he was the
world number one golfer and he was by

[1:26:00]
world number one golfer and he was by
far the best player in the world and he
decided to do something very
counter-intuitive that he would
completely redesign his payoff he would
completely redesign it if you're like
you're the best in the world what are
you doing like you play offs are really
good like you don't need to start your
drive learn to drive again but he
realized that in the future he needs to

[1:26:16]
realized that in the future he needs to
be able to hit the ball further off the
T and other players were going to do
that so he spent months and months
rebuilding his swing whilst being the
number one player in the world so for
you you were rebuilding strategy in
advance because you thought that the
players would catch up or exploit you
based on your your style so yeah I think

[1:26:31]
based on your your style so yeah I think
that's a really high level way of
thinking you're almost thinking moves
ahead and the chessboard kind of analogy
and yeah it shows like the kind of high
level thinker you are and you said
you'll spend like 500 hours on
rebuilding strategy compared to playing
so yeah really really uh amazing to hear

[1:26:46]
so yeah really really uh amazing to hear
that and then it sounds like that set
you up for 2020 which is what I really
want to dive into so uh 2020 as you've
told us was the year you played a
million a million hands at 1K plus now
this came with a consequence and you
describe this in your questionnaire as a

[1:27:01]
describe this in your questionnaire as a
rock bottom moment where you hit a
burnout so first of all talk us through
what this kind of yeah overall like
playing this much volume and how did you
set out your days and weeks to
implementing to execute on a million
hands of the course that year
yeah it was like

[1:27:16]
yeah it was like
uh
it's I can like say it easy one day I
was waking up
playing I got coffee some small
breakfast uh playing for like uh four

[1:27:33]
breakfast uh playing for like uh four
hours or something like that small
session when I sometimes watch one
series of something is my wife spent
some time with my child and went play
like uh eight to ten hour session like

[1:27:48]
like uh eight to ten hour session like
so I was playing every day at least 10
hours
I had one
one break for like uh
something like 10 days or something like

[1:28:02]
something like 10 days or something like
that but I played Without weekends I was
playing cavity day uh playing 10 hours
plus uh
I was reviewing hands mostly when I
trying to fall asleep just because after

[1:28:16]
trying to fall asleep just because after
such sessions my brain was too hard to
get to sleep fast so I was just watching
conform hence what someone sent me
watching hence what uh I marked
and I was just playing playing and

[1:28:31]
and I was just playing playing and
playing and
at some point
uh I understand what I just uh tired too
much I I wasn't
I wasn't completely burned out maybe but

[1:28:48]
I wasn't completely burned out maybe but
I was understanding what the
it's not public challenge it's no
pressure on me
and I'll say it's like fun but I ignore
it again uh I had the

[1:29:02]
it again uh I had the
like four four months in a row I had a
pain in my neck what like I wake up with
pain on my neck and it's going up and up
and like in two hours I start to head

[1:29:16]
and like in two hours I start to head
pain in my head but I was just uh use uh
some tablets like what
I don't know how to say like against
headache so I didn't like I ignored uh

[1:29:32]
headache so I didn't like I ignored uh
pain for like almost half year I just
didn't do anything about that when I
like when I recognized what it's super
stupid but I go to doctors only after

[1:29:46]
stupid but I go to doctors only after
half year I think and it was like in the
end
uh I was it was in Freedom I moved to
three doctors in my hometown I did MRT
and finished it in full checkup at

[1:30:02]
and finished it in full checkup at
Moscow and uh they find out what I have
something like called musket depression
or something like that it's like it's
depression but you don't feel yourself

[1:30:15]
depression but you don't feel yourself
upset you just have a physical pain
something like that yeah
for you to change your ways and you're
taking painkillers and headache tablets
to relieve it and pushing through so uh
yeah one understands what your mindset
was this year because it sounds like you

[1:30:31]
was this year because it sounds like you
were a bit obsessed you're playing 10
hours a day playing weekends why were
you so driven this year what were you
trying to achieve in 2020 that made you
uh almost ignore signs of pain and just
play player through anything yes well
one of my it was like uh

[1:30:47]
one of my it was like uh
different type of goals first one this
was like trying to find the gap of what
I can do like try to find my limits uh
second was uh one was uh what we

[1:31:03]
second was uh one was uh what we
decided to stay in Russia we was like
thinking to move somewhere but then we
decided what we love our hometown so I
decided to build house of my dream
which is now sounds like big mistake in

[1:31:18]
which is now sounds like big mistake in
situation what happens in the world now
but we decided to do that
so I played like for myself for like fun
and find my limits and for building
House of my dream

[1:31:30]
House of my dream
and also like uh
it's like funny to say like I think I'm
gambler but I'm I'm gambler but like I
like to think a lot about what I do and
why I do this so a big part of this

[1:31:46]
why I do this so a big part of this
challenge what was I was understanding
what if I want to build house of my
dream and go up or on limits I need to
win a lot because I don't want to stock
and at the nail like 5K and lower to
green and to have just good life and

[1:32:01]
green and to have just good life and
build house I wanted to uh be ready to
play with anyone in higher Stakes so I
understand what I need big role for that
and it was like one of drivers too and
maybe it was one of reasons why I born

[1:32:17]
maybe it was one of reasons why I born
burnout before this because I had like
uh in that time was running some big
games like 40K 100K 200k and uh I
finished this year I play it million

[1:32:31]
finished this year I play it million
hands with like
uh five something give ebb and uh
3.9 real real 100 per
month birthday and uh it send it up like

[1:32:48]
month birthday and uh it send it up like
I had nearly a million under UV and it's
while it's also like big pressure
because I understood what I'm
I can't play wall carrier like that like

[1:33:00]
I can't play wall carrier like that like
24 7. uh so it was like uh putting extra
pressure on me also maybe it uh it was
one of things what uh burned it out me
faster I I didn't feel like oh I'm so

[1:33:15]
faster I I didn't feel like oh I'm so
unlike or something like that I was just
uh understanding what uh it uh took some
opportunities from me
um but it's okay so it sounds like you
took on this challenge very consciously
you had a very clear objective which was

[1:33:30]
you had a very clear objective which was
first of all to find your limits find
what your cup of your potential is and
where you could go on poker and then you
had building your dream house so with
these two things fueling you you just
want to play all hours of the day every
hour available you want to put volume in
so uh as we can we're going to talk

[1:33:45]
so uh as we can we're going to talk
about a second this led to you hitting
the burnout moment and you talked about
in 2021 so that yeah following this
million hands that you've played you had
a badge start the year January to me you
said you lost 500 care and this yeah
basically came as a consequence of

[1:34:00]
basically came as a consequence of
potentially grinding so much so tell us
through like how you were first of all
getting through that time so say 2021
when you went on this downswing were you
still playing at the same kind of volume
or and how were you pushing through this
kind of turbulent time
yeah it was it was a bit fun like uh

[1:34:17]
yeah it was it was a bit fun like uh
2020 or like at September I feel like I
almost burn out uh so I like I play in
class until November when uh November to
December I played a lot again and backed
my passion to the game and decided from

[1:34:31]
my passion to the game and decided from
2021 to play less start to learn crypto
uh start to put more time with my family
uh and uh then started huge downswing

[1:34:45]
uh and uh then started huge downswing
and
some like right I think it was like
pretty big amount of this year when I
planned same or more than previous year
so like plan plan was to play less but
when I was on downswing I just decided

[1:35:01]
when I was on downswing I just decided
okay [ __ ] I need to crush them it was
like it's clear
ly it was was the more ego film I just
uh I was feeling what I want to come a
bit but I can't count when I'm uh not on

[1:35:15]
bit but I can't count when I'm uh not on
Peak like uh because I still was super
competitive like I'm still super
competitive I just wanna play
mm-hmm yeah so it sounds like when your
box against the wall things aren't going
well for you you double down you want to

[1:35:31]
well for you you double down you want to
work harder you want to get yourself out
that situation a video that meant you
have grinding a lot of hours you said
before that one of your strengths is
playing high volume in tough lineups and
very often when life gets tough we
revert to our strengths what am I good
at how do I get myself out of this and

[1:35:46]
at how do I get myself out of this and
yeah it sounds like for you that led you
to play a lot more volume than you
planned on playing in 2021 which at
first had a bit of a downside you
definitely had a tough uh five months
January to me but then you managed to
get it all back as you get it all back
so tell me for that time in what changed

[1:36:00]
so tell me for that time in what changed
when you started to go on on that kind
of upswing was it just variance or did
you make any changes when you went back
in the upswing too
like well this unit was just pure swing
gear I lost a lot because it was huge
downswing when I won a lot because it

[1:36:16]
downswing when I won a lot because it
was upswing and it was like uh
um
it's funny I think because uh like a lot
of discussions on like who is best
player who is good who is bad and like

[1:36:30]
player who is good who is bad and like
maybe it's like my PSG or something like
that but I always telling what you can't
uh say anything about someone's game if
you never stop human huge downswing
because like anyone can play good one
here are good I mean not not just sound

[1:36:46]
here are good I mean not not just sound
random like he run correctly to Evie
it's uh it's much easier when you have
like super swing periods yeah so I just
I I had good upswing in wall summer and

[1:37:00]
I I had good upswing in wall summer and
this summer was super dry there was
almost like I think 80 or 90 percent of
red wires or something like that I just
I just win a lot from them
and okay and uh like after I did this I

[1:37:16]
and okay and uh like after I did this I
decided to put more time on crypto and
put more time on traveling I go to Vegas
played a couple of events there go to
Disneyland with family I played uh some

[1:37:30]
Disneyland with family I played uh some
big events on Cyprus it was super hero
your ball I think so I just uh from
after I reached my peak of uh band crawl
and uh of my self-confidence I talked

[1:37:46]
and uh of my self-confidence I talked
with few friends and uh like all of us
we think what you're now it's like on
state where you can to break your long
break and then you need just like months

[1:38:01]
break and then you need just like months
or something like that to get in good
form again
if you are good now because game is like
it's not solve it but it's not uh
changing very hard it's like only small

[1:38:15]
changing very hard it's like only small
changes only small
you know New Phoenix so from like uh end
of September oh it's like even it was
from start of September to may I almost
didn't play any hand I was I was still

[1:38:33]
didn't play any hand I was I was still
doing some reviews just because it was
interesting to see what guys doing when
I'm not playing
like I I was
it was funny it was like watching some

[1:38:47]
it was funny it was like watching some
hands from our games like watched
streams of friends and I was waiting
like okay maybe they show some new
tricks so I will be like oh [ __ ] I need
to go back to Poker faster so I will be

[1:39:01]
to go back to Poker faster so I will be
not like uh super far behind but nothing
like that happened
likely for me what I found interesting
about your story there is as you said
like you find a lot about poker players
in terms of who's a very good player in

[1:39:16]
in terms of who's a very good player in
terms of how they deal with downswings
and how they respond how they put the
Game responds to that and also how they
show up during those times for you it
sounds like you really double down on
playing and studying whilst you are in
the kind of peak down swing and then you
got out of that downswing it's very

[1:39:31]
got out of that downswing it's very
interesting that at that kind of peak
moments say financially are coming out
of the the bad patch then you start to
get a bit tired and bored with poker and
I feel like for you you're the way
you've spoken us today and it sounds
like you don't like doing things unless
you're interested unless you're killing
serious so for you when you decide to

[1:39:46]
serious so for you when you decide to
take a step back from poker it sounds
like you've spoke with some friends to
make sure like all right am I made the
right decision is this suicidal am I
going to be care so tell me for like how
you felt removing yourself from poker
because as you've talked to us today
you're someone who wants to be the best
you pride yourself on being like at a

[1:40:01]
you pride yourself on being like at a
high high level so when you took a step
back from poker through being tired and
burnt out how would you deal with that
mentally in terms of feeling the value
of that pocket you need that head for
you all right so I I was just pretty
Curious by crypto it was pretty
interesting I started to dive deep a lot

[1:40:17]
interesting I started to dive deep a lot
I was like I read it everything but I
couldn't confound I found groups of
people who work in their uh so yeah I
just found another thing called to be
obsessed off but uh in the end like why

[1:40:32]
obsessed off but uh in the end like why
back to poiker it's because
after like half year and Greta I
understood what is
it's good thing to make money it's a
good thing to improve our world but it's

[1:40:45]
good thing to improve our world but it's
not interesting like at least for my my
mindset it's not very interesting so I
probably will like instead of Market
land like now I will edit focus it on
poker when I will maybe like mix it and

[1:41:01]
poker when I will maybe like mix it and
some parents I will work only on crypto
I think but probably I will just uh for
my
Leaf I will play poker or do something
like that because crypto is like it's
more like job

[1:41:16]
more like job
it's there is some interesting things
uh and also you need to be in to don't
miss something big and interesting maybe
maybe crypto will change and some new

[1:41:30]
maybe crypto will change and some new
things appear what will be interesting
too but for now it's like a bit boring
and the biker is not getting bored like
like I wasn't right on it's it's super
new level it's like very interesting to
be there even if you're tired from uh

[1:41:47]
be there even if you're tired from uh
online games you can came to something
like that and you like will be super
inspired and super interesting to play
because everything there was super good
um so this stage your career after you

[1:42:01]
um so this stage your career after you
took that break did some of your crypto
stuff you realized crypto maybe didn't
Engage The Mind in the same way pocket
did for you so for you right now like
what is it about poker that makes this
game so fascinating you're already
playing like as high as you can play it
what makes this game still get your mind

[1:42:15]
what makes this game still get your mind
intrigued and interested and want to put
time into uh to learn more
yeah because
I still have a lot of questions when I
play it's like still a lot of things but
uh you can dive deeper you can think

[1:42:30]
uh you can dive deeper you can think
more
and it's super
super interesting like after I played
life and to meet uh a lot of high stakes
guys it started to be even more more
interesting to play against them because

[1:42:45]
interesting to play against them because
you see how smart I am and like uh most
of them are younger than me and it's
like it's funny feeling because I
probably one of oldest player who
playing a lot now and in same time I

[1:43:02]
playing a lot now and in same time I
started to play poker later than ours
like most of them playing like 10 plus
years but younger than me and it's uh
it's making it even more challenging for

[1:43:15]
it's making it even more challenging for
me because I think like I'm a little bit
underdog
by a lot of terms but uh I think I still
can
be competitive
comes back to this kind of thread line
that's been going through of you seeking

[1:43:30]
that's been going through of you seeking
challenges and you find it interesting
to compete against other high-level
people so a lot of players might get
intimidated when they go to uh meet
other Live players and play high stakes
games you realize everyone's really
smart some of these guys are really
young and got a lot of potential but for

[1:43:46]
young and got a lot of potential but for
you it's actually the opposite you're
like all right this is what I'm this is
what I'm made for and like again
strength you said high volume in tough
lineups that's what you've found out
about yourself so I like that over over
time you've learned to uh kind of trust
yourself trust your instincts of what

[1:44:00]
yourself trust your instincts of what
you should be doing and when things are
interesting for you you just go on that
line you go in that direction so yeah
really really great to hear it's also
the thing like uh when we was talking
about downstairs and I forgot to say
like uh people uh asking seeking for

[1:44:15]
like uh people uh asking seeking for
different cues from Downstream and like
for me it was always just to put more
work on like if I'm like in every a lot
of people playing more than their Ryan
good and play less than the way you run
bad and like when I run bet I just put

[1:44:32]
bad and like when I run bet I just put
more and more work on myself like I play
more I review more I watch more I try
more it's like I think it's not super
good because for mental state better to

[1:44:47]
good because for mental state better to
play when you run good because you like
have much more dopamine you're happier
when you play and but as I told like my
driver is Andrew so
I feel I think it's not super good but

[1:45:01]
I feel I think it's not super good but
it's it's really super hard to change
myself and I don't want to do it
I just try I'm just trying to not feel
bad about that like I'm not fifth I am
not feel bad from that I when I have

[1:45:16]
not feel bad from that I when I have
downswings I am not like sitting like
that and trying to go [ __ ] help me I
just okay I will fight
I would say it's a very positive
character traits because if you think
about it like you said everyone could

[1:45:31]
about it like you said everyone could
play a great poker when they're winning
but when things are getting bad when
you're in a downswing that's very often
when people cave they do less they still
feel helpless going into a victim
mindset but for you you do the opposite
you work a lot harder during downswings
so if we play that out over the course

[1:45:45]
so if we play that out over the course
of your career every time things got
tough and hard you still ignore you've
played more you did you learned more
during those times so it's almost like
if you look at your growth as a poker
player every time things went hard you
got better you got better and better so
this almost makes you kind of
bulletproof going forward because when

[1:46:00]
bulletproof going forward because when
things get hard you do more you show it
more obviously when things are going
good yes we could argue that you could
maximize your EV more by putting it
along hours when you're in a good
cognitive state but in terms of like
growing and proven the fact that you've
doubled down when things get hard is a
great trait it's a huge huge upsizing I

[1:46:16]
great trait it's a huge huge upsizing I
definitely wouldn't worry about that I
actually see a lot of players need to do
the same and work on how to develop that
attribute it doesn't always mean during
the dance when you play a lot you might
actually just Deep dive deep into your
game and try to improve but at the same
time finding ways to work harder when

[1:46:30]
time finding ways to work harder when
things aren't going well in order to get
yourself going in the right direction
again so yeah really really good yeah
all right sorry sorry one more thing
it's like it's uh What uh I find out not
that long ago but uh in a situation like

[1:46:46]
that long ago but uh in a situation like
mine you need to understand what the you
need to be very focused on your mind
because uh when you work more in dance
Fields it's uh you're like your passive

[1:47:00]
Fields it's uh you're like your passive
brain part might start to think what you
really unlike it because you put a lot
of volume when you run by bed and like
your brain recognizes that okay I run
bad breach a lot but it's it's just

[1:47:15]
bad breach a lot but it's it's just
because you put more pressure on and you
you can't ignore it because you will
have you might feel your self unhappy if
you just ignore that think
a very good point very good points so

[1:47:30]
a very good point very good points so
yeah what you're saying is when you're
on a downswing your vision's a little
bit clouded and you can almost assume
that you're running back because things
aren't going your way if you put lots of
volume in junior downswing you might
deceive yourself into thinking that or
you might deceive that situation as I'm
running about I'm getting lucky like I

[1:47:46]
running about I'm getting lucky like I
bet you're having many conversations
with pocket players who almost feel a
bit disheartened by the way things are
going they're playing more pocket than
ever during a downswing but because
things just feel bad during the
downswing they almost magnify their
problems and think things are going
worse than they are and see I think it's

[1:48:01]
worse than they are and see I think it's
definitely good to be aware of how your
mind's responding to uh that's during
the downswing and also like some players
play more volume is the solution other
players is like no like work more in
your game but I think the kind of
overall kind of theme of put more work
in junior downswing try to solve the

[1:48:15]
in junior downswing try to solve the
problem what's going on why is this
downstairs occurring sometimes that
means going internal reflecting on
yourself other times that means about
any strategy but the times that's been
showing up consistently and being at the
tables to uh level up the variance but I
think it's very very good to think about
the problems that can come up as your as

[1:48:30]
the problems that can come up as your as
you're trying to go through that

goodness in today's episode

[1:50:45]
goodness in today's episode
alright so ready for yourself have you
got any Peak Rock moments I'm not sure
if I'll ask you this before but any
moments in your career look back on and
go up that was the toughest part of my
career
where do you want to start Adam
the peak the peak the Peak Rock Bottom I

[1:51:01]
the peak the peak the Peak Rock Bottom I
would say the big rock bottom I mean I
went broke many times not many times
Maybe
that I can now recall twice and I fought
one of the hardest ones was
and actually this was actually a
question that was also going to ask

[1:51:15]
question that was also going to ask
Victor so it's a it's a good question
that you asked me is like when things
were not going my way went broke but in
the same time in my case I was living
abroad uh uh I was living in Brazil I
was married to my wife I had to take

[1:51:30]
was married to my wife I had to take
care of my wife also financially as she
was just focusing on her studies so that
added a lot of pressure to having to
perform well in poker and obviously when
you're trying to play and there's more
pressure on it and you're not playing
while we're in a downswing that really

[1:51:46]
while we're in a downswing that really
that that's not really a great I'm gonna
say a great environment to stimulate
good performance and I was wondering uh
how because Victorious Praise his
girlfriend for always being on a site
how did she respond to you going broke

[1:52:02]
how did she respond to you going broke
for the first time for example my wife
she's definitely very risk averse and
obviously also spoken players we
understand the game a little bit better
we understand that statistically you
know it's very unlikely but it can
happen uh how did she respond especially
when she's pregnant and I assumed that

[1:52:17]
when she's pregnant and I assumed that
she was relying on you for a source of
income how did she respond and how did
you respond
um with the pressure of having to take
care of someone so your poker
performance people are relying on your

[1:52:30]
performance people are relying on your
poker performance where before I was for
example married if I would screw up I
would just screw up for myself and
that's fine but now you're suddenly
screwing up for both your wife and your
future child how did you cope with that
extra pressure or did you feel that
yeah this time was pretty hard

[1:52:47]
yeah this time was pretty hard
like but I
uh most fun thinking that with my wife
she like she don't know much about
Parker I mean uh just last in this year

[1:53:02]
Parker I mean uh just last in this year
I was or last year I don't remember
probably last year I won like EPT and
such or something like that and it was
first time when she watched it uh uh TV
translation and it was like first time

[1:53:18]
translation and it was like first time
when she recognized what time like sort
of known somewhere uh because we don't
discuss poiker and something like that
and what I had
hard times I was very stressed

[1:53:33]
hard times I was very stressed
I was thinking what I'm failing for my
family and for myself
and like my wife
I don't know how to explain it

[1:53:45]
I don't know how to explain it
she was like she was Stone Cold cow he
was like I told I talked to her I told
like what I don't know uh what it's
super bad what happened and something
like that and she thought like okay you

[1:54:01]
like that and she thought like okay you
will be good anyway like she's like She
Believes In Me much more than I believe
in myself or someone believed in myself
and when I recognized it
like it's more when someone can give me

[1:54:16]
like it's more when someone can give me
she just like she just believed me in
100 she like she's super sure what uh
any bad thing what can happen I can
handle it and I can go through it
yeah that's I think yeah that that's

[1:54:30]
yeah that's I think yeah that that's
that that definitely releases the
pressure right in moments when you're in
doubt about yourself that someone is
there to re reconfirm like Hey listen uh
we will be okay just you know to ease
your mind I think it's huge because from
that from that moment you know you can

[1:54:45]
that from that moment you know you can
calm yourself down a little bit and
actually start to play a good poker
again I I even watched like a little bit
mad because I was telling her okay I
lost a lot of money we're building house
we have trouble and she's like so what

[1:55:01]
we have trouble and she's like so what
like you will make it back like what's
the pro and this was like I was okay
like everything greeted everything is
bad I don't know what's going on and
like she was super calm like like she
asked me like do you think like you

[1:55:15]
asked me like do you think like you
can't handle it yeah of course I can
like I will handle it why you like
Andrew why did you why you mad all will
be good and I was like okay [ __ ]

[1:55:33]
I don't think she will believe in uh
anyone she doesn't believe in anyone
else okay okay good point yeah
that's how it's supposed to be that said
loyalty right

[1:55:45]
loyalty right
um I'm curious you were talking about at
that face when you were trying to jump
up to like the real high stakes the
nosebleed Stakes that you had to you
went to the process of rebuilding your
strategy you mentioned studying for 500
hours it's quite a lot uh I'm curious

[1:56:02]
hours it's quite a lot uh I'm curious
how does rebuilding your strategy look
like and what do you spend 500 hours of
studying on just out of curiosity yeah
yeah most of the time I just uh uh
watching different spots on solver I was

[1:56:16]
watching different spots on solver I was
trying to watch it pretty deep and
making lots of uh what I see there what
I think it's working like that also when
I saw something called Verde I was just
trying to make some

[1:56:30]
trying to make some
uh how to save
uh like some tests uh when I just put
something uh what can never happen so
like extremely small range extremely
weird ranges just trying to see how

[1:56:45]
weird ranges just trying to see how
solver uh changes his mind in some
different spots it's like uh I think a
lot of players so long stakes and like
still have this uh film uh in their mind
what they must do something they like I

[1:57:02]
what they must do something they like I
you might hear this a lot like I must
call this hand because if I'm not
calling here I am ever father but like I
always telling to these guys okay just
put your opponent like range of set plus

[1:57:17]
put your opponent like range of set plus
and you always have left catcher and
your opponents have only set plus so
they're never called you you didn't must
do anything you need just to play a spot
like it is and uh

[1:57:30]
like it is and uh
this story oh yeah I forgot remember
it's toy game it's called Thai game yes
so I was doing toy games I was uh doing
a lot of uh solder stuff with knots and
uh also like most of my work now it's uh

[1:57:47]
uh also like most of my work now it's uh
reviews of my opponents
yeah I think this is uh especially
important when you reach very small Boos
and nosebleeds where everyone already
has a certain level of strategical
knowledge right everyone has studied the
solver and at some point The Edge that

[1:58:02]
solver and at some point The Edge that
you can gain by get studying even more
solver at some point it's just so
minimum compared to if you indeed study
certain tennis is your opponent and come
up with uh more exploitative game Planes
around it or we even had we had I think
it was Jam Big Joe who we had on who was

[1:58:16]
it was Jam Big Joe who we had on who was
really trying to pay attention like
who's cheat who's a bit tilted this
month right and how does how does a
downswing you mentioned playing one of
those things how do people react how do
their games change when they're in a
downstream compared to an upswing for
example so you kind of know what to

[1:58:30]
example so you kind of know what to
expect a bit more is this kind of stuff
that you're looking for as well
yeah yeah it's like uh when you if
you're going to get up onions it's like
it's pretty interesting because like you
see so
so like some mistake on him you're going

[1:58:47]
so like some mistake on him you're going
to solver you put in you see how you
might exploit him but uh the next thing
you do it's your put your exploits
against GTO to see how fragile your new
strategy will be so you you always need

[1:59:01]
strategy will be so you you always need
to understand like uh if you're Expo why
it will fall uh wanted will be worse for
you comparing to do nothing and it's
like always like uh some ways to double
check how it will work and it's very

[1:59:17]
check how it will work and it's very
interesting and also when you're
reviewing components like you're doing
the same thing you don't just watch on
frequencies you're trying to watch on
frequencies plus showdowns plus their
General strategy to understand how he

[1:59:32]
General strategy to understand how he
thinks
you don't trying to like okay this guy
fall to free bed five percent smaller
than GTO so I will free bet him while
you know you're just trying to
like put yourself in his head

[1:59:47]
like put yourself in his head
yeah it's very interesting what you were
referring there to was kind of you're
estimating the risk reward of your
exploit like how much does my exploit
works if it works but if it backfires
how much does it loses and does the risk
balance out the reward sort of

[2:00:00]
balance out the reward sort of
yeah I think it's like it's think what
you you must think you you can't think
of your opponent's idiots you like you
you can tell them what they are radius
you can't threshold but you never need
to underestimate them

[2:00:15]
to underestimate them
have you learned this through the hard
way
yes
could you maybe give an example
uh like the first time was when I
crashed the no not crash when I lost on
5K when uh in like 2017 and uh when like

[2:00:36]
5K when uh in like 2017 and uh when like
uh like I see just
a couple of It's Always couple of
showdowns you know like for example I

[2:00:46]
showdowns you know like for example I
was still playing a lot against munis
and uh like
I was think what he is or folding a bit
and when like in two sessions in a row
he made break your light calls against
me and okay okay it started to like

[2:01:03]
me and okay okay it started to like
change something
yeah at some point also analyzing
especially it's interesting when you
analyze people's games
especially if these players are also
analyzing your games then it's almost

[2:01:16]
analyzing your games then it's almost
becomes more worthy to analyze your game
to kind of expect how they're gonna play
against you instead of you because their
game is kind of a accumulation of
exploits that they make versus various
players so they don't really represent
anything whereas if you think at some
point I did this as well a lot when I

[2:01:31]
point I did this as well a lot when I
was battling high stakes to be very
aware of your own statistics and if you
know that someone is a bit more an
exploitative player you can actually
kind of already ahead think of okay if I
will be playing versus myself
would I be over bluffing in this spot

[2:01:46]
would I be over bluffing in this spot
for example like you mentioned that you
uh you tended to be a bit too much of a
station right you're a red line too much
so you could already think okay if I
would be playing against myself and this
guy is an exploited player is he likely
to over Bluff me well most likely not
right

[2:02:01]
right
yeah but like it's also a fun thing
because
like you can be stationed in different
spots you always need to think about how
deep your opponent of Nola is you
because like for example you can be
stationed in most of sports but some

[2:02:15]
stationed in most of sports but some
spots you have your fault against
population and your opponent might see
this and you always need to
like it's really a lot of levels of yeah
how deep you can dive
you know so yeah it's always spending a

[2:02:30]
you know so yeah it's always spending a
lot of time to see what people doing
against each hour and what people doing
against you personally like uh there is
like
a lot of people doing a lot of French
researchers now in hand to notice like
super good too and uh one day I

[2:02:48]
super good too and uh one day I
understood what I I I I don't I don't
think I first who did this I but I did
range results only through my database
to compare how different uh reactions in
most of sports people doing against each

[2:03:01]
most of sports people doing against each
other and against me and I also did like
uh then I did some researches against
different type of fields playing to each
hour and our stuff like that because
it's as you told you need to understand
how people playing against you against

[2:03:16]
how people playing against you against
each hour against our players and how it
affects their stats and their strategy
that's that's very interesting indeed
like sorry sorry it's it's almost part
of answer to Adam question about why

[2:03:31]
of answer to Adam question about why
Porter is still chairman for me because
like still a lot of questions like this
yeah because it's not yeah it's not
necessarily for example GTO looks at a
spot in isolation in a solver whereas

[2:03:45]
spot in isolation in a solver whereas
indeed if you mix in player profiles and
how they perceive certain spots like for
example people who study a lot of data
they will have clear uh clear spots
where okay on this type of
um
uh scenarios population tends to

[2:04:00]
uh scenarios population tends to
overbluff under Bluff then if you start
to kind of flip your strategy you start
to under Bluff in the over love spot and
start to over bluffing on the blood
spots yeah then you get then you get to
a whole nother level and you get that
indeed like you know certain players
make sure to reach okay yeah this is at

[2:04:15]
make sure to reach okay yeah this is at
some point when you play against very
good players they know okay yeah this is
a classic overblock spot
now what do I do you know I cannot
overblock because he knows it's declare
over plus one so he's never gonna fold
but then if he sees you every time
giving up there's like okay he's not
he's not he's not bluffing the classic
overbluff spot and then there you get

[2:04:31]
overbluff spot and then there you get
exactly the levels that you were talking
about and this is I guess what keeps
what makes you keep coming back
yeah this type of metagame flows super
interesting like it was I was I started
to notice this when I was grinding Zoom

[2:04:46]
to notice this when I was grinding Zoom
200 because it was like I remember like
like a couple of months everyone playing
with super high seabed uh when people
started like uh people check race switch
it from like eight on the Flop to 22

[2:05:01]
it from like eight on the Flop to 22
then some people started adding uh mean
free bets on the floor when people just
decided okay I just started to see but
less and this like going like it's like
flow
it's going in now people changing

[2:05:15]
it's going in now people changing
strategy and like it's it looks pretty
beautiful it's pretty interesting
what is the you you're describing like a
trend where you see population using
strategies and then population is trying
to use counter strategies and then
another counter strategy is being made

[2:05:30]
another counter strategy is being made
right and that's kind of the flow that
you're describing what is uh a current
flow that you are experiencing
throughout poker this year
uh now people
uh I think people understood pretty a
good borderline of uh solder calling

[2:05:47]
good borderline of uh solder calling
hands so people stationed pretty well
like uh there's a lot of people who call
pretty correctly and uh also
a lot of players under Bluffs uh in most

[2:06:02]
a lot of players under Bluffs uh in most
of spots because they uh just they just
see what people focus it on Collins part
and so you like most most of goal of
Bluffs is you to get caught wide enough

[2:06:16]
Bluffs is you to get caught wide enough
so people going to under Bluff now and
it's uh funny to see like different
players uh trying to attack different
spots like uh no one can play just like

[2:06:30]
spots like uh no one can play just like
super neat everyone trying to keep Bluff
frequencies but they like split and get
differently and it's pretty fun because
it make some unbalances but these
unbalances like not super exploitative

[2:06:45]
unbalances like not super exploitative
but it's uh uh very hard for brain
because if you wanna play better than
field you need to focus on uh every uh
opponent what you play
because like everyone in general if you

[2:07:02]
because like everyone in general if you
watch on stats uh it might look like
everyone playing the almost same game
but they just have small small tricks in
their pockets and it's always
interesting to try to find it yeah it's

[2:07:17]
interesting to try to find it yeah it's
what you said right just a stat just the
frequency doesn't really it doesn't
include the texture it only shows the
frequency it doesn't show the range
composition of exactly the frequency in
that spot so is it to Value heavy is it
to to to to Bluff heavy you know are you

[2:07:32]
to to to to Bluff heavy you know are you
going to be bluffing in spots where no
one ever Bluffs is you know or do you
just keep on bluffing in the obvious
blast spots yeah it's uh it's it's
indeed a level I I have to say I did
also if I can say one Trend that's
different from in the past it's now is

[2:07:45]
different from in the past it's now is
indeed that that most players that I
face station or at least you know the
trend is that people are fighting more
for pots over the years uh whereas in
the past a couple years ago the trend
was more that people tend to fold so
aggression was the way to go then and
the bus had to be very aggressive then

[2:08:01]
the bus had to be very aggressive then
the pool response and now everyone
starts to become a station and now you
have to kind of find nuances within when
do I station you can just be be a
station for the sake of being a station
is it then also like I'm curious in
terms of
players what do you think sets sets a no

[2:08:17]
players what do you think sets sets a no
split rack well let's say let's say 10K
and L plus uh rag apart from like a 1K
to 5K wreck for example
um
first one will be discipline I think

[2:08:32]
first one will be discipline I think
like discipline to play in uh in same
state for a long time
uh and also in biker part it's uh
understanding of ranges because uh like

[2:08:46]
understanding of ranges because uh like
people who play lower they
they just uh count combinations for
slower and they just
don't understand Equity well enough I
think
so they just make and uh

[2:09:02]
so they just make and uh
they may make it like call not because
they understand the EV or this action
just because they see like okay he
probably Bluff uh enough and that's

[2:09:15]
probably Bluff uh enough and that's
already the reason for these players to
call they and they sometimes putting
themselves on spots they're like their
belief catcher not good enough about
against range because Bluff have high
Equity or something like that uh they

[2:09:31]
Equity or something like that uh they
don't understand realization of equity
pretty well but uh for now a lot of
players of 1K and an L 500 uh pretty
well playing pretty well and there's

[2:09:45]
well playing pretty well and there's
like also big difference between uh
uh young players who playing these
limits and uh players who play there
just because they're stuck and don't
want to go further because young ones a
lot of young ones have been playing

[2:10:00]
lot of young ones have been playing
pretty well they just don't rolled
enough and they just don't experience
enough maybe they have mental problems
maybe they just most of them just need
time to move to the dots
yeah there's no uh there's no shortcut

[2:10:16]
yeah there's no uh there's no shortcut
to the top right if you if you if you go
faster then you're allowed at some point
you will experience something and you
will get knocked down kind of what you
were experiencing right when you were
taking the 5K shots I remember also from
uh from a more from a confidence
perspective I feel like you have to

[2:10:33]
perspective I feel like you have to
grind a certain stake for a certain
amount of time and put a win rate for
you to confidently say like I belong at
this Stakes where if you go too fast you
might mentally identify yourself as a

[2:10:45]
might mentally identify yourself as a
500 Zoom rack and you're suddenly
playing in a 5k game then your
confidence at that stake is just too
fragile whereas if you start losing a
little bit you don't really feel like
you belong at that stake yet so you will
be forced to move down and like I said
yeah the only way is with time right

[2:11:00]
yeah the only way is with time right
people have to learn to be a bit more
humble as you mentioned the ego granted
in a way you're like okay you can you
can you can Trash Talk people you have
to learn to manage your money you have
to make certain mistakes in order yeah
to to yes also

[2:11:15]
to to yes also
depends spread your heart on personality
like on how you
how you recognize poker at all like as I
told like for me it's just an hour game
so I'm easier to short easy to feel

[2:11:33]
so I'm easier to short easy to feel
myself stupid easy to understand what
I'm not good enough somewhere and I'm
not
I'm not feel myself
super stressed when I'm not good enough

[2:11:46]
super stressed when I'm not good enough
like once
I had like birthday and I decided what
like best what I can do is give myself
20K to
go regard and gay just because it will

[2:12:01]
go regard and gay just because it will
be interesting like so I just told
myself okay you can lose 20K on 10K bar
it was like Lino Smith Stefan in
glucoplay something like that and I just
I just was super easy I finished it

[2:12:16]
I just was super easy I finished it
around Break Even but uh I already
was counting what I left this panel on
the table and
most of the diamonds like that for me I
just uh when I played playing I'm just

[2:12:32]
just uh when I played playing I'm just
focusing on the game and I don't feel
super stressed and also afterwards like
if I shotting something I'm losing uh I
don't

[2:12:45]
don't
I don't lose it by confidence after this
I can I always like think I but I will
repair this even in hardest times
and some people for some people it's
just too hard I like even do the uh he

[2:13:01]
just too hard I like even do the uh he
was on your podcast and he told but for
him it will be super hard to go to
higher Stakes If part uh buff will be
harder but it just depends on
personality
so what are some of the personality

[2:13:16]
so what are some of the personality
traits you think that made you this
successful
um I don't know I think maybe it's it's
always like a lot of different
businesses so like some people people

[2:13:31]
businesses so like some people people
who are around me like some pretty
unhappy
childhood
and like a lot of things in my life
um made me like stoic a bit so like I'm

[2:13:46]
um made me like stoic a bit so like I'm
I'm not focusing on hard times I mean
[Music]
um
I'm not feeling too much pain I can say
from some bad things

[2:14:01]
from some bad things
I just I can't say what I'm extremely
happy you know like some people they're
like super positive or something or
something like that I'm not super
positive and hard times I just okay I
know it's hard times but I I just must

[2:14:15]
know it's hard times but I I just must
go through it and that's all I'm not
trying to
show myself more happier than I am or
something like that I just always
telling but
said said things or happens it's life

[2:14:30]
said said things or happens it's life
what what else can I do if I will focus
on how it's hard or how I am unhappy it
can't help me anyhow so I just need to
go further and
trying to do my best
just keep doing what I'm doing

[2:14:45]
just keep doing what I'm doing
yeah there's a definition of stoicism
here you acknowledge you accept the
situation for what it is then you
realize okay it's only perception how do
I how do I handle this situation that's
like you know the concept of focus on
what is in your control in this case I

[2:15:01]
what is in your control in this case I
think throughout the podcast I heard you
say many times when it comes to
adversity and shitty things happening
you you said it was fun fun thing
happened you every time live with it as
fun right and also with the downswing
you kind of saw downswing also as like a

[2:15:16]
you kind of saw downswing also as like a
motivator or as a necessity right to
study more in your game so this is what
I kind of mean with the perception how
do you perceive a downswing are you
gonna try to learn from it are you going
to try to use it as motivation right in
this case you get angry because you're

[2:15:30]
this case you get angry because you're
competitive you don't want to lose you
know which you know can have this
you can have his good side it can have
his dark sides uh but you know it does
it does enable you to use a situation
like that and actually view you and make
give you energy in order to improve

[2:15:46]
give you energy in order to improve
yeah yeah it's like it's mix of all of
this and uh I also like always when you
watch uh retrospectively you understand
what uh almost every bad thing what

[2:16:00]
what uh almost every bad thing what
happened in your life uh hell but you
helped you to become stronger and the
main thing it's like to understand in
momentum what when you're in [ __ ]
situation what if you do well if you
don't break you will be good anyway so

[2:16:18]
don't break you will be good anyway so
like uh you just need to accept but it's
new challenge it's new part of your life
like every second our life is changes
you're in New State and you just need to

[2:16:31]
you're in New State and you just need to
try to be focused on doing good things
and also it's like I think it's work or
in outside world too you just all you
need to do is focus to be a good person

[2:16:47]
need to do is focus to be a good person
for yourself and if you're a good person
for yourself you will be good for each
hour for other people's you might help
them you like to help people like I
think everyone inside want to help our

[2:17:00]
think everyone inside want to help our
people be happier because when you see
how in our person smiling it's always
good for you yeah you mentioned actually
that this was also one of your
motivations to come on the podcast you
know you try to educate other players
share your experience so maybe their

[2:17:16]
share your experience so maybe their
Road becomes a little bit easier but the
main thing that I thought was very
interesting that you said I want to help
people become happier this is like
often when we begin in poker we're just
so focused on you know reaching success
we want certain things materialistic we

[2:17:31]
we want certain things materialistic we
want money at what point did you realize
in your career like actually the the the
end goal of life is to have a happy day
today when did that moment sort of Click
for you
uh what I understand what I can do

[2:17:46]
uh what I understand what I can do
things what I love for quite a long long
period of time and it won't affect me in
uh Financial part
so like if I want to travel and I can go
travel if I want to play I will play and

[2:18:02]
travel if I want to play I will play and
if I want to spend like a lot of time
with my family and I still want to go
broke or something like that and uh also
when I understand what I can
use

[2:18:15]
use time how I want to use it
this time how you want to use it so it's
it's kind of Freedom that you're
describing
yes yes be able to do whatever you want
to do whenever you want to do whatever
you want to do it

[2:18:30]
you want to do it
yeah yes yes exactly and also like
a very big part of why I love uh poiker
as work not just this game but his work
it's what you can uh
contact only with people what you like

[2:18:47]
contact only with people what you like
you you don't you don't forced to like
be good for your boss or something like
that you you just can pick up people

[2:19:00]
that you you just can pick up people
pretty wisely you can
spend time only with people but uh
interesting for you and what uh
you have you have a really great time
with people but around you yeah you

[2:19:16]
with people but around you yeah you
don't have to deal with people my wife
for example she's an orthodontist and
she sees patience all the time and she's
sometimes tells me story about people
flipping out and stuff I'm like okay
very happy I don't deal with deal with
people on a daily basis yeah so that's

[2:19:30]
people on a daily basis yeah so that's
definitely an advantage if you're an
online poker player yeah it's like it's
weird feeling because
in general
I love people but it's mostly until I
contact them
okay

[2:19:46]
okay
yeah I I I mean like when you hear all
these stories from casual work or from
some bureaucracy or something like that
and then you like
going to chill because why you can just
do normal things but on our way like I

[2:20:03]
do normal things but on our way like I
was reflecting a lot about this and I
understand like super hard to be
uh very happy when you most of the time
you forced to do something what you

[2:20:15]
you forced to do something what you
don't want to do even if you like it
like you even if we talk about book or
someone might love poiker but uh
if you must play something or do
something it's much harder to be happier
and also like uh what your players have

[2:20:32]
and also like uh what your players have
a great great privilege to control their
time so you have some free time to
meditate to read something to discuss
something with smart persons deeply not

[2:20:47]
something with smart persons deeply not
small dog but like big conversation and
it's this thing is like Priceless I
think best what we can have in our life
to share experience and read something

[2:21:00]
to share experience and read something
it helps you
to understand
better what's going on around you
both mechanics of love life and
all of this

[2:21:17]
all of this
reflecting on your your poker career
what is something that poker being a
poker player taught you that you did not
expect
[Music]
um
in better good sight both in yeah in

[2:21:34]
in better good sight both in yeah in
that side it's uh emotions like
biggest trouble after 2020 when I
grinded a lot it was uh it was super

[2:21:45]
grinded a lot it was uh it was super
hard for me to feel happiness I mean in
general I had I I like how I live in and
all this stuff but I mean like uh
it was super hard to get Happy from

[2:22:01]
it was super hard to get Happy from
random stuff
and uh
I break this when we was in uh
uh Disneyland
and I was watching called my son who was

[2:22:16]
and I was watching called my son who was
watching show there
so I was like like it was great show and
I find myself what people watching on
the show and I just watching on my sound
reactions and I was it was a big moment

[2:22:30]
reactions and I was it was a big moment
of Happiness what helped me to start to
feel happiness again
and um
good thing about boy periods time of
course because you can
you can use it much more wisely because
you can make your own scheduler you can

[2:22:47]
you can make your own scheduler you can
make breaks you like you can even
if think in things like reading when you
put your player and you find good book
you can stop playing for a couple of
days and read this book deep enough when

[2:23:02]
days and read this book deep enough when
you're working on normal job you come
after job and you know the state of mind
when you like reading something and five
pages you just understand what you don't
remember what you just read you just do

[2:23:17]
remember what you just read you just do
your brain is too hard and when you put
your player you can skip this pairs
because you can just take breaks and
it's like it's think what I think
everyone is need
just some some time for yourself what

[2:23:33]
just some some time for yourself what
whatever you're doing okay I I think
it's big mistake of a lot of people
trying to spend all the time correct try
to spend all their time to became better

[2:23:45]
to spend all their time to became better
like sometimes you can just uh lean on
your bed doing nothing and this will be
the best thing what you can do now
yeah which can sometimes be very
counterintuitive right if you were
trying to progress to a certain goal or

[2:24:00]
trying to progress to a certain goal or
you want to get out of a certain
situation doing doing nothing from time
to time can make it better quite
restless but as you have experienced you
know you there's a certain at some point
you need to take a break you else you
will sort of burn yourself out
um Adam I'm I'm curious like I think

[2:24:18]
um Adam I'm I'm curious like I think
struggles with emotions in general right
I think in society men have more trouble
with dealing with their emotions than
than women right just as a stereotype oh
we have to be men we cannot be emotional

[2:24:30]
we have to be men we cannot be emotional
and then poker kind of enhances that
even further because you cannot show any
of your emotions it's kind of the the
yeah the the the the the status quo of
being a poker player any any tips for
players how to deal with emotions shoot

[2:24:47]
players how to deal with emotions shoot
without emotions in should we close
yourself up promotions how do we deal
with emotions
um well I find it very interesting that
Victor phrased it as emotions were the
bad side the bad side of the lessons
learned through poker and I feel like a

[2:25:00]
learned through poker and I feel like a
lot of players can relate to that when
they start playing for a living and
professionally all of a sudden all these
emotions come to the surface that they
haven't experienced throughout their
life almost like why am I feeling
insecure why am I feeling anger why am I
feeling Rich when they're generally a
calm person who obviously the cocktail

[2:25:15]
calm person who obviously the cocktail
of the pressure of Poker or your
identity being being tied to being good
at something and probably just the
perfect breeding ground to bring
emotions to the surface now the problem
most poker players face is they don't
want to go through this process of
learning to deal with emotions and they

[2:25:31]
learning to deal with emotions and they
want to numb them or push them aside so
you end up going for a fears where you
try to be quite robotic a lot of players
will and you try to numb emotions that's
almost like a kettle that's boiling and
putting your finger or blocking the top
and the baquel's boiling at some point
that's gonna blow up all right emotions

[2:25:45]
that's gonna blow up all right emotions
when they suppress the bubbling below
the surface and at some points it will
explode also when you go down the route
of numb and emotion or trying to
experience less of it exactly what
Victor says all of a sudden you struggle
to find happiness in small moments so
all of a sudden you need something big
like winning the big tournament or

[2:26:00]
like winning the big tournament or
having your best of a day to feel happy
when the little things like watching
your child smile or go and have a nice
meal with your partner which used to
bring you Joy stops bring you Joy so now
in this awful situation where you're
like I want to keep these emotions down
but when I do I'm not experiencing life
as I want to so then it comes through

[2:26:15]
as I want to so then it comes through
the kind of the kind of solution to the
problem is to allow yourself to
experience a wide range of emotions now
like grenade touched on for us men
that's very difficult we like to
suppress we like to go to the minds we
like to kiss there from the heart and I
think feeling based and go to the mind
to use logic so I think the kind of

[2:26:31]
to use logic so I think the kind of
biggest gift pocket gives a lot of
players is to teach you that you have to
learn to deal with emotion all right now
we've got a whole cocktail whole
spectrum of what emotions you will go
through but the main thing is to allow
yourself to experience them but at the
same time staying in control all right
so uh in the first like kind of solution

[2:26:46]
so uh in the first like kind of solution
to the emotion problem is to map out
which emotions you experience I watch
cocktail emotions you've experience
something will experience very high in
one they're high and ones like tilt in
anger and they're very easier spot
others just feel a little agitation or a

[2:27:01]
others just feel a little agitation or a
little bit insecurity or lacking
confidence so you've got to get a kind
of profile of what your emotions are
then you've got to go internal all right
you've got to get an introspection so I
like that Victor talked about meditation
as a kind of tool I used to kind of go
into the minds and meditation is very

[2:27:16]
into the minds and meditation is very
good for emotions because it creates a
bit of space between our thoughts and
our experience so when you meditate for
a period of time all of a sudden you get
a bit of space where you can sort of see
emotions all right now emotions have
signatures they feel a certain way in
the body and the mind generally tells

[2:27:30]
the body and the mind generally tells
you stories about how you're feeling all
right so as you go through your life and
in particular you have to get good at
experience in original emotions while at
the same time staying in control right
so the first thing is to build that
level of awareness and the second thing
is to allow yourself to experience them

[2:27:45]
is to allow yourself to experience them
now this is the hard part it's almost
like a car is going very fast down the
motorway and you're holding on the
steering wheel the goal is to build
experience a wide range of emotions and
stay in control now at first that's very
challenging a lot of players will reach
out to me and go Adam I've got this tilt
episode I feel really angry when this

[2:28:00]
episode I feel really angry when this
happens anger is a very hard emotion to
deal with because that's like a full
speed emotion and very often your
logical processing has been shut down so
you acted very emotionally and
reactively so you've got to build a
profile of what emotions you're dealing
with you've got to realize the stories
you're telling yourself that it leads

[2:28:15]
you're telling yourself that it leads
that emotion and then in a kind of hard
to explain way you've got to get good at
like letting the heart Express emotion
all right it's not suppressing not
numbing allowing things to come to the
surface and allowing yourself to
experience emotions now this becomes a
challenge because we could argue that
being a robot with zero emotion in

[2:28:31]
being a robot with zero emotion in
theory could play out better because you
would not get any till episodes you
could just play the same game over and
over but in terms of being a human and
experience a life you don't want to go
down that route you want to be allow
yourself to experience more emotion so
as if any players looking to work on
this start to get very comfortable with

[2:28:45]
this start to get very comfortable with
the emotions you're experiencing start
to realize what things are leading to
those emotions and it will lead you down
a path which will very often lead you to
the mind which is telling you a story
about the situation all right so the
emotions generally the reaction because
the mind doesn't like what's happening
all right so we're in a situation I

[2:29:00]
all right so we're in a situation I
don't like that I've lost I don't feel
comfortable that I'm not winning so
obviously your mind's telling yourself a
story about the events which just leads
to this emotion so you've got to go into
the operating system understand the
stories you're telling yourself and
allow yourself to feel the emotion while
at the same time change that story

[2:29:15]
at the same time change that story
narrative all right so if every time I
lose it poker I call myself an idiot and
I suck and I'm not worthy oh that's a
very strong story so every time I lose a
poker that emotion's gonna come to the
surface so for me to work on that first
of all I've got to realize what is the
insecurity coming up what's the emotion

[2:29:30]
insecurity coming up what's the emotion
and the intensity of it how is that
feeling in my body and then I've got to
start working on what is this story I'm
telling myself is it true is it accurate
and then you start breaking down that
story if I lose the book does that
really mean I'm an idiot no it doesn't
so you're gonna start on what wrapping
the story so and the two Avenues one is

[2:29:45]
the story so and the two Avenues one is
understand how it feels in the body and
come to feel the emotion I think most
sport players shut the process off and
they go straight to the minds the now
the Mind tried to fix emotions without
any feel is very challenging because
it's almost like they speak different
languages and you can't logic your way
through emotions so I say players who

[2:30:01]
through emotions so I say players who
need to learn how to feel emotions then
also learn to get comfortable and with
the stories that you're telling yourself
to uh kind of work through them so yeah
I'm interested Victor for yourself so
who says emotions were the bad side of
the game but I think for the audience
and myself and Randy listen to you it
sounds like you've got a pretty good

[2:30:15]
sounds like you've got a pretty good
control right now of your emotional
state you sound very stoic you sound
like you don't have much of your
identity attach your results so what are
some of the things you've had the
learner tips of managing your own
emotions in the public context yeah I
think like as I told my uh biggest
driver is probably Andrew and it's like

[2:30:31]
driver is probably Andrew and it's like
it can be told as a path like first I
was not even understanding what is my
driver and what uh my main emotion when
I recognize what it's uh Andrew I just

[2:30:45]
I recognize what it's uh Andrew I just
uh tried to separate it and I was like
okay I can't just talk to some people I
was like I was a lot of times I just
rushed out to someone when I apologize I
just I try to explain people what I'm
doing it's not a bad purpose but it's it

[2:31:01]
doing it's not a bad purpose but it's it
was helping me to play Easier like so
when I didn't understand about Andrew I
was just sometimes when I angry enough I
just played bad uh next step is what I
was when I was Andrew I still played

[2:31:16]
was when I was Andrew I still played
okay but I just stretched out and uh my
final point now it's when I feel Andrew
I just go study my opponent to brush him
next day so like for now uh I I

[2:31:31]
next day so like for now uh I I
understand manager I understand my like
what we can say like bad emotion or
something like that I understand why I
have it uh how to understand it how to
find it and I just uh when I feel it why

[2:31:48]
find it and I just uh when I feel it why
I'm playing I just delay this delay this
to when I go to my work
so when I just opening database of my
enemy I like I mean I mostly use the

[2:32:00]
enemy I like I mean I mostly use the
volume to randomly for my friends
in real life so I just using it like
this and I think it's it's think what
helping me a lot
perfect the actual payment application

[2:32:15]
perfect the actual payment application
is exactly what I was talking about
where first of all build awareness of
the emotion itself and how it's
impacting you so first of all you found
out that being angry was causing you to
play back play aggressively then you
realize that isn't a very adaptive
response and you need to change that so
then you worked on just trash talking

[2:32:30]
then you worked on just trash talking
people and the next step was you have
that fears but then ultimate base was to
use that same emotional state so to not
try to hide it to not try and suppress
it when you feel that emotional state of
anger you now work on crushing your
opponents and that makes sense you into
the lab and working on it so you're
you're now fully embodying the emotional

[2:32:45]
you're now fully embodying the emotional
experience that you have in but you're
using it in a very adaptive way and
that's like I think that's the Ultimate
key because now if you look at a lot of
people try to suppress emotions so what
happens is they feel uncomfortable when
they when their bodies experience their
emotions so they try to limit the kind
of range of emotions they experience

[2:33:01]
of range of emotions they experience
with what you've done you've widened
your range of emotions that you can
function experience in and Italians
you've got to play around with that so
it's almost like you start with when I
feel heightened emotions I can I can
play well with a certain National states
that caused me to devious strategy or
make mistakes and over time you want to

[2:33:16]
make mistakes and over time you want to
bring in more emotional states that
allow you to to play at your best so uh
yeah I think with emotions it's very
important to really strip them down to
their Core Essence of what's happening
but also the person one by one every
emotion is different and has a different
kind of end results so for you you could

[2:33:30]
kind of end results so for you you could
see the kind of chain of events that was
happening from this and you work
backwards and you over time you build
more adaptive strategies that over time
now when you feel that emotion you work
to crush people that's amazing so like
every time don't get you angry say
Michael Jordan in the Last Dance is like
um I really like that a Netflix

[2:33:45]
um I really like that a Netflix
documentary one of the things that I
learned from that documentary is do not
get Michael Jordan angry because he will
crush you he will use that fuel of anger
and he will play the best game of his
life so if you're an opponent playing
something like that you're like all
right that's just walk on eggshells
Michael Jordan do not get a man great
he's provoking you trying to get you to

[2:34:00]
he's provoking you trying to get you to
spark him he's going to use that where
other players would get angry let's
follow up the game the player really bad
and they wouldn't believe Eliza so yeah
I really like that you found a way to
use a kind of heightened emotion which
most people count as bads you use that
in a positive way so that wraps up the

[2:34:15]
in a positive way so that wraps up the
emotional summary which is great Renee
have you got any uh last questions to
wrap us up yeah well it's funny that you
mentioned that because he said now when
I'm angry at someone I'm gonna study and
I'm like okay if you play against Victor
probably don't make him angry just say
every time when he joins the table now

[2:34:30]
every time when he joins the table now
everyone's like hey Victor how's your
day going lovely to see you everyone's
gonna treat him like a god like don't
get it don't get Victor angry I don't
want him to start studying me I didn't
even didn't do anything wrong uh

[2:34:46]
um
the last point I wanted to touch on
before before we're gonna
close off is you mentioned that you uh
kind of you know I'm curious where you
where you see poker going from here you
you said actually that you don't expect

[2:35:01]
you said actually that you don't expect
a lot of strategical involvement if I
understood that correctly in the game
right you think that we have reached the
point where it's not gonna you can just
take a break for half year and come back
you also mentioned that you started
playing some Triton Events the the high

[2:35:17]
playing some Triton Events the the high
rollers and that really triggered again
your passion and your interest for poker
I was curious like
what are you currently most intrigued by
in poker is that indeed like the live
poker events where I think we already

[2:35:33]
poker events where I think we already
talked about this uh of pod as well
where you get to meet like a lot of nice
people
um where you know you play against the
best of the best is this something that
you're looking to do more in the future

[2:35:45]
you're looking to do more in the future
uh I don't like all of this I can say
like for now I will focus on online
because it was it's a bit funny I I
don't think it's only because of that
but uh I meet the Linus couple of times

[2:36:01]
but uh I meet the Linus couple of times
and I was like a little bit trolling him
like dude why you don't play are you
good are you still good enough and
something like that uh yeah because like
he wasn't grind a lot and I now I

[2:36:16]
he wasn't grind a lot and I now I
understand what he just find passion in
our way it's not like because of me but
uh now he's grinding gelotti and I'm not
playing can I feel a bit ashamed because
it was always because I was trolling him
to play and uh now I took like break

[2:36:32]
to play and uh now I took like break
because of moving
somewhere so I wanna do play more online
and feel this pretty interesting now
because like there's a couple of
different Crews who work with each hour

[2:36:47]
different Crews who work with each hour
and have different strategies it's like
it's dutch crew it's kruka Brian uh and
Kevin
and it's like Austrian crew it's Darrell
Linus uh Marcus and some other guys uh

[2:37:04]
Linus uh Marcus and some other guys uh
it's uh some it's Russian Guru of Aurora
and Munoz it's stefanosh per me like
separate we don't work with the shower a
lot uh and it's Spanish guys nacho and

[2:37:18]
lot uh and it's Spanish guys nacho and
Davey and uh every almost everyone is
playing differently and it's very
interesting so I think my brain will
have a lot of hard food

[2:37:31]
but that's what you like right yeah yeah
it's I think it will be a very
interesting time and uh also I want to
go for next right and if it will be in
Asia because I'm going to Thailand soon

[2:37:46]
Asia because I'm going to Thailand soon
yeah so I could use for both uh online
and your life and also
it's uh as a adult like in hard periods
so I always want to focus on work and

[2:38:01]
so I always want to focus on work and
it's like hard period for a wall water
now and a lot of people experience a lot
of outside stress and of course most
hates people from Ukraine and Russia and
uh it leads me to put more focus on my

[2:38:16]
uh it leads me to put more focus on my
work too because I I just uh
I don't wanna I forgot how to not not
Doom switching it's like when you're
always reading bad news because almost
every news is bad and a lot of people

[2:38:31]
every news is bad and a lot of people
just dive into this serrated Hall and uh
I understood pretty fast but it's very
bad idea to do this so I will just focus
on my family friends and do my work for
now yeah there's I completely agree I

[2:38:47]
now yeah there's I completely agree I
don't follow follow any type of news
because as you said it's all very
negative and 99 of the time there's
nothing I can do about it anyway so then
it's like okay yeah okay thank you for
this for this news now and I'm just

[2:39:01]
this for this news now and I'm just
stressing out because the world is
[ __ ] right and I compared to in the
past like in the past people didn't have
access to news around the whole world or
they might only have access to news
within their country or even within
their city now if there's nothing going
on within your city they will look at

[2:39:15]
on within your city they will look at
okay is something bad happened in your
country no in the world okay we will
find something and there's more bad news
and some people like have other views on
this maybe they think you know you
shouldn't
close yourself off from the world per se

[2:39:30]
close yourself off from the world per se
I personally agree with you I think it's
fine to just uh close your off you're
not acknowledging that you know you're
not pretending that the world is a fairy
tale but you don't have to get reminded
of all the [ __ ] that happens in the
world all the time that will not make

[2:39:45]
world all the time that will not make
you any happier
yeah
um any uh any any last words that you
would like to say to our audience
anything that you would still like to
discuss that we haven't discussed so far
before we wrap it off no not much I

[2:40:01]
before we wrap it off no not much I
think we've had great pretty great
conversation and like
or what I can say to like if some young
players will watch this it's like
try to be happier when you play like try

[2:40:15]
try to be happier when you play like try
to focus on feeling good emotions while
you're playing like feeling negative
emotions can be a good weapon in some
points you can turn an angel to be more
productive or something like that but uh

[2:40:31]
productive or something like that but uh
if you try to focus on like happy
emotions
it will help you to be in the game much
longer if you will be happy from winning
pots Happy from good sessions and things

[2:40:45]
pots Happy from good sessions and things
like this so I think it's best it's best
what you can do to improve your
living
like your player
because
I think

[2:41:01]
I think
not only me a lot of players who players
who play high stakes they driving by
negative emotions they like doing
through challenges but uh you you don't

[2:41:15]
through challenges but uh you you don't
need to be high Royal to
Leaf had your life and it's like it's
main part what a lot of players need to
recognize what if you're stuck on some
limits it's not meaning what you've
given up or something like that you just
uh your main goal is to live good life

[2:41:33]
uh your main goal is to live good life
you as I told like when we was talking
about solvers you don't must to call
something because like it's gdr and same
with life you don't must do something

[2:41:46]
with life you don't must do something
because it's like
everyone doing this you didn't must try
to be high stakes wreck or because some
people did this you just you need to
reflect more on yourself and try to be
happy

[2:42:00]
happy
very wise words yeah I think being
actually what you said like
acknowledging and accepting any type of
current situation that you're in is very
important because if you don't like the
situation that you're in if you don't
accept the situation that you're in you

[2:42:16]
accept the situation that you're in you
will only increase the stress you will
increase a lot of negative emotions and
that can often just spiral and only
getting more of the same whereas if
you're just very happy uh with with the
current or at least if you're not
negative towards the current situation
and if you just try to enjoy the process

[2:42:32]
and if you just try to enjoy the process
often you will experience more emotions
than you will sort of attract more
positive things happening to you in the
future so it will actually make it way
more likely that you actually end up
reaching your goals Evan you probably

[2:42:45]
reaching your goals Evan you probably
have something to say around this before
we close off this seems like a topic for
you yes it's very much in my field of
expertise or at least interest and yeah
I think your emotions have EV to some
degree so when you're in a heightened
emotional state feeling good you're
generally going to to play your best

[2:43:01]
generally going to to play your best
poker and have a higher EB as well as a
higher enjoyment of the game in the same
time when you're playing and compromised
emotional states whether that's anger
rage frustration you have a lot of EV
for that session like um Victor was
talking about overall like what is the
goal like what are we doing this for and

[2:43:15]
goal like what are we doing this for and
sometimes we get so fixated on the short
term of making money playing certain
Stakes that we lose sight of the bigger
game to be happy to live a meaner for
life and to enjoy the experience of
being a human so yeah I think sometimes
we've got we get so zoomed in on a
Pursuit where reality take a step back

[2:43:30]
Pursuit where reality take a step back
reflecting and going why am I doing this
and if ever you find yourself doing
something because you feel like you
should do it and you're forcing as the
corner you need to take a step back and
reflect and go and why am I feeling this
way why am I putting a gun to my own
heads and make myself go I can remove
the gun I can reflect and I can decide I
want to do this I move ahead and if you

[2:43:46]
want to do this I move ahead and if you
don't want sometimes that means taking a
step back and I think Victor's story
throughout this has been a really good
example of not just going One Direction
and just take a step back reflecting
when you're feeling burnt out or tired
from poker just take a break take a step
back and reflect and realize what you're
doing it so yeah I think it's a really

[2:44:01]
doing it so yeah I think it's a really
really good lesson to put yourself into
a good emotional state whilst playing
you can use negative emotions to drive
you but they should be short-term fixes
and short-term action steps to drive
Behavior change but the main part you
should learn to enjoy the pursuit of

[2:44:15]
should learn to enjoy the pursuit of
sure not playing poker and over time
you'll find you play your best in those
States and you'll have a much longer
career because you're using a kind of
long-term fuel source of height emotions
to drive you so yeah really really good
uh kind of lessons there and perfect end
to the conversation from my point

[2:44:30]
to the conversation from my point
wrapping up another great podcast
episode thank you a lot Victor for
sharing all your wisdom Adam main
takeaways from our conversations with
Victor for you
well what a great guest I think he
shared a lot of wisdom and his story was

[2:44:46]
shared a lot of wisdom and his story was
very compelling motivated and he shared
a lot of character traits that I feel
like are very useful for any player to
develop and the five character traits
I've picked out through this episode
were his skill of perspective all right
so he's developed a skill to uh look at

[2:45:00]
so he's developed a skill to uh look at
situations both from a long-term
perspective but also how that
Situation's helping him he's very
objective about plan ahead and seeing
how things that are unfolding aren't so
detrimental and this allowed him to uh
move downstairs quite easily without ego
it allowed him to shot it higher Stakes

[2:45:16]
it allowed him to shot it higher Stakes
when opportunities arose and he never
really lost sight of what he was trying
to achieve and once he over time he
learned how to develop that perspective
skill to become a better poker player
next to carry that trailer picked up
from him was resilience I mean anybody
who listens to this episode or doesn't

[2:45:30]
who listens to this episode or doesn't
think this guy's resilience needs to
re-listen but yeah just basically any
challenge that came up he found a way
for that to make him stronger to learn
from it and he always rephrased
challenges as something that was fun or
enjoyable I never really got beaten down
by anything thing that book out through
his web so any challenge that came up

[2:45:45]
his web so any challenge that came up
almost battled hard on him and he came
back even stronger third character trait
I picked up was work ethic this guy
works hard like so we talked about 500
hours of redesigning his game we talked
about 70 hour work weeks every single
week for a full year a million hands in
2020 playing 1K plus that's extreme work

[2:46:02]
2020 playing 1K plus that's extreme work
ethic really really uh yeah high level
work ethic that he's learned to develop
at the same size he pushed it he pushed
it too far at times and he burnt out he
had to learn to uh how to use that work
ethic in a good way without burning out
and pushing himself too hard then the

[2:46:15]
and pushing himself too hard then the
next one's self-awareness you always
seem to come back to uh try to
understand himself better I found it
very interesting when he thought about
poker being a strategy game at first and
over time he realized he had a lot of
mental leaks that he was ignoring he had
the self-aware awareness enough to see
coaches seek advice in order to find out

[2:46:31]
coaches seek advice in order to find out
basically what was holding them back he
also found out a very big strength of
his which is to play high volume in
tough lineups now for most players
that's suicide when I volume himself
lineups the most players you're gonna
broke but for him that's what brings him
alive that's what he enjoys that's why
he still plays pocket today because he

[2:46:46]
he still plays pocket today because he
wants to be in those tough lineups to
challenge himself to learn and get
better and the final character trait I
picked up was discipline and he for his
discipline as doing the same things
consistently over and over even when it
gets boring so walking in mind for me at
the start of the conversation was when

[2:47:00]
the start of the conversation was when
he was talking about most people get
good at something and then they stop
letting the cap out he said because the
the amount of effort to put in to get a
slightly bit better becomes
exponentially harder so this is called
the law of diminished returns so if I'm
going to learn a new skill whether it's
poor girl something else you get a big

[2:47:15]
poor girl something else you get a big
increase like you spike up like zero to
80 is very quick but maybe six months to
a year but then that final 20 can take a
lifetime so the peace have been proven
the pace of learning is a lot harder so
you don't get the immediate
gratification you don't get to see
yourself getting better in big chunks

[2:47:30]
yourself getting better in big chunks
like you do with stars so now you're
going to learn to be consistent and
almost do the same things over and over
for a smaller and smaller return in
terms of getting better so yeah I think
those character traits really Shone
through really enjoy the conversation I
think he's a yeah really high level
thinker in many situations and yeah use

[2:47:45]
thinker in many situations and yeah use
it probably shared some wisdom that you
guys as the audience can relate to and
take on board going forward how about
for yourself for any what are some of
the main things that you took away from
this conversation
yeah like like all other other guests
this characteristic traits you know this
is not a coincidence we see a returning

[2:48:01]
is not a coincidence we see a returning
pattern right uh he also mentioned again
surrounding himself with the right
people he said that he was lucky to have
the right coaches that gave him the
right mentality you know he started with
his coaching football then the people
that he surrounded himself uh with in

[2:48:17]
that he surrounded himself uh with in
like the internet cafes then he ran into
uh Stefan he ran into I think it was
invoker if I'm not mistaking so always
looking for people when he started to
get troubles with his mental gaming
hired the psychotherapist to better
understand what's going on and in all

[2:48:31]
understand what's going on and in all
situations he acknowledged that the
situation was [ __ ] he accepted it and
from there he just he didn't spend much
time on like oh look I mean I'm in a bad
situation he he never had a victim
mentality right he also said yeah you

[2:48:45]
mentality right he also said yeah you
know this is just how I grew up where
I'm from life is hard to deal with it
right and yeah the kind of kind of the
yeah what does it kill you make your
stronger mentality was definitely was
definitely installed in him I also wrote
down don't make it make him angry
because then he will start studying you

[2:49:01]
because then he will start studying you
and try to beat you don't get in those
anger side okay everyone from now on be
very nice to Mr Victor if you play
against him
uh again a trend that comes back from a
technical perspective let go of what you
have to do right have a more Curious

[2:49:16]
have to do right have a more Curious
approach towards studying solvers why
does it do certain things try to
understand the mechanics he mentioned
that it's very important to for example
use the program called flopzilla in
which you can just build uh ranges and
see range distributions how equities

[2:49:31]
see range distributions how equities
favor on a certain board and in that
process because you know a solver
basically already did everything for you
but in that process he says you learn
things and that actually makes you stick
and if you learn to understand like
certain range constructions or certain

[2:49:45]
certain range constructions or certain
Equity first Equity what kind of
consequences consequences that would
have to a strategy you will start to see
patterns which become like sort of the
mechanics behind strategies and you can
then translate that to other spots that
you haven't studied okay this guy
actually what we explained in our

[2:50:00]
actually what we explained in our
coaching program as well that's why we
call it the mechanics of Poker right
it's built around certain mechanics and
they'll come back in every spot learn
the mechanics and you can basically play
every spot okay
and he also indeed talked about
how certain things in a solver or

[2:50:16]
how certain things in a solver or
motivations behind the software right he
said yeah we Bluff because our value
needs to get paid if you have a range it
doesn't include Bluffs in the solver and
a lot of gloves you don't get paid off
so your value suffers and it's the same
with no you don't have to call here

[2:50:30]
with no you don't have to call here
understand that you usually only call to
make sure your opponent cannot start
over bluffing you so you basically call
for realization and there's many things
around solvers that people copy but they
don't actually apply in the real world
actually in our update that made a whole

[2:50:45]
actually in our update that made a whole
chapter I think it took two hours it's
called solver World versus reality where
I explained all the reasons behind the
the strategies of solvers not
necessarily from a mechanics point of
view but more like why certain things
are very important like indeed bluffing

[2:51:00]
are very important like indeed bluffing
like indeed Bluff catching like
balancing like you know all these type
of things and then we're gonna reflect
on how this actually applies in the real
world so if you're interested in that
reminder
applications for are mechanics of Poker
2.0 are now open okay there's we're

[2:51:16]
2.0 are now open okay there's we're
taking on around 10 students so if you
think you have what it takes to master
the mechanics of Poker go to mechanics
of poker.com and apply and then we'll
review your application and see if
you're the right fit for our program
okay

[2:51:30]
okay
I want to thank everyone I want to thank
my co-host Adam for providing all his
knowledge again he went on some good
Rambles about the Motions today I think
it was very good stuff very definitely
worth listening back to that as I think
it's a struggle point for most players

[2:51:46]
it's a struggle point for most players
