in in the Army you kind of learned to
deal with [ __ ] so I basically doubled my
bank roll in the first three days after
turning pro I think I lost like 10 to
15% of my netw worth in like four hours
what lesson did that teach you not to
play Drunk and uh tired I guess is it uh
is it better to be like a little bit too
self-critical or the opposite that's the
thing right you're afraid that you will
lower your standards when you drop
yourself critic ISM I think the big
thing is to being being able to adapt
and uh change your strategy over time
what is the the current metha I think it
for sure atex is very very call happy
people are not fing I like to say that
there's like five different shades of
Rags but then there's like hundreds of
shades of fish but but basically what
he's doing is he's avoiding
uncomfortable feelings that arise when
he's moving up and these are like
examples of indeed like things that are
beyond the technical game like the
technical game is only what 30 40% of in

Cod mechanics SE has joined the call so
let's start today's episode all right SE
thank you for coming on the podcast
man thank you for having me I'm a big
fan actually of the btat so it's great
to be here SE I saw you got into poker
when you were only 10 years old I'm
wondering what attracts a 10-year-old
kid to Poker and how and where did you
start
playing yes so actually the first time I
ever even
knew about poker was like I think it was
when I was 10 years old and I think I
saw like Casino Royale it was uh just a
new movie back then and uh that like
obviously it has the big poker scenes in
Cino Royale and that was uh kind of the
first time I
uh got interested in poker it was uh
pretty obviously the movie is
quite exciting and the big HP pocker
scene with it and then uh after that I
got super interested in poker even at
101 I was something like 20 101 years
old and I actually got quite into it
then I uh started to went to all the
like film uh places very good rent films
you know the old the DVDs and VHS and
just search for any any kind of movie
that
uh basically had pocker in it so so I
was just obsessed and uh kind of wanted
to see everything about poker and then I
uh obiously I got found some a lot of
movies like rounders for example was one
of them and then I think there was
couple of others there wasn't quite a
lot but there was a couple uh couple of
movies that had poker I think yeah
rounders was one of them and then uh
there was this one movie with Sylvester
Stallone
with they played like seven SC card stud
in it which was uh kind of interesting I
don't remember the name of that but yeah
I uh saw those and was quite uh actually
into it back then and then actually at
that time like there used to be like old
the WPT tournaments on the TV in Finland
and uh actually my mom uh recorded those
for me because they were so late so I
couldn't uh could have watch them
because they I think they started at
like midnight so my mom would record
them and then I would uh look at them at
the next day so it's was it's pretty
funny to think think now back then
because uh did you manage to get some
practicing yourself as well or did did
you stick to watching yeah I I played
with a couple of friend a lot of with my
friends because I was playing football
so with on the a lot of the football
friends we were playing poker and uh
during the football trips on the bus for
example we used to play a lot of Poker
back then really for money already or uh
I mean what what you put on the line
what what do you put on on the line if
you're a 10-year-old kid I don't know I
didn't have any money when I was 10 I
mean we were playing for like 5 Cent 10
cent basically like really small Stakes
but still still for money and actually
there's some couple of pretty Dent Dent
stories back there there was a couple of
guy guys who we were also playing like
rock paper scissors for money which is
quite Dent for us 10 10 11 year old but
yeah we were always playing there was
actually a couple of other games we were
playing for money like there was this
card thrown game so we basically took a
card and tried to throw it next to a
wall and the the one who got closest
would win actually I was quite a big
Crusher in that game that was was my
main game like the card drone game but
yeah we were we were playing a lot of
games during the football trips and a
lot of Poker was played also I remember
we we used we used to play this game as
well where you said where you throw like
you have to close throw it closest to
the wall but we would then I think like
best of three or something and then if
you lose you would lose the card so
let's say I think we did with like
Pokemon cards and stuff like that fos
back then or like uh I don't know how
you call this balls you know whoever is
closest to the wall and then you just
lose your ball or your your card since
yeah like I said I had no money on me
man when I was
10 yeah I don't think we were bling for
super high stakes but it was still still
money I mean 10 EUR is quite a lot for a
like 11 12 year old kids so you mention
you mentioned you were doing it like on
the football but bus and your mom was
sort of involved as well uh did no one
said hey guys maybe we shouldn't gamble
when we're 10 years old
I think I I think nobody really uh bad
an eye actually it was quite normal even
the like coaches or parents weren't too
I mean we weren't playing like
super obviously high stakes and it
wasn't that serious I guess so nobody
got into big debt at least uh but uh
yeah do you recall deploying already any
like sort of strategy or was it just uh
you know you look at your cards and try
try try try to connect with the board or
do you remember recall any sort of
conscious knowledge of what you were
doing no not really actually it was
quite everybody was kind of guessing
around and I think it was quite a lot of
gambling so not really strategy involved
I think back then you already mentioned
like football have you been competitive
in any other sports or games before
poker no not really actually football
was the only one I mean I play video
games decent bit and uh
I wouldn't say competitively but I'm
pretty competitive so when I do
something it's I take it pretty serious
so even though I'm not really playing at
a competitive level uh some video games
I uh try at least pretty hard so you
don't like losing yeah no for sure
not so that was already like from a
young age you me you mentioned football
how how competitive were you playing
football I was
uh like the I think the years like
between ages between like 10 to 16 I was
like
super putting a ton of effort to
football and it was like my main goal
then to become a professional football
player but then um and actually won
couple of like championships in Finland
uh like under 16 and 15 I think but then
I got injured when I was 16 and then and
uh that kind of I was off for
like little under six months and that
kind of took lot of the motivation from
putting the effort in the game and then
also like I kind of realized that I'm
not good enough
to good enough to get into the big
leagues basically so I maybe I could
have
like could have become a pretty decent
player in Finland and uh like the
leagues in Finland but uh that wasn't
like super motivating to me if that's
the kind of the ceiling for my career so
and actually at that time I around 17 I
found poker again and then uh that kind
of sealed the nail in the coughing at
that time I was like super excited when
I at 17 I I think I found like uh like a
YouTube video like old high poker like
Heil helmet clip and that kind of
reignited my uh excitement and passion
for
poker uh that I had like at 10 11 years
old so then it was kind of clear
that football wasn't really the thing
and uh actually at that time like both
football and kind of school before that
I was like putting a decent effort
effort in school too but then when I
found poker like both both school and
football for did the back burner and I
was like obsessed with poker after
that what what what is it that you like
about the competitive environment of for
example taking football serious or you
said you don't like losing and obviously
poker very competitive environment as
well yeah I think I don't know actually
like I think it's just like seeing being
being skillful at something was always
like the thing for me like being good at
something and when you're
like better at better at something than
somebody else it's kind
of gratifies you for sure and
then yeah I guess that's that's the main
thing that it's kind of
shows that you're good at something when
you're like competing as other people
who are taking this stuff seriously
so I guess that's like sort of the
ranking system of it yeah for sure like
seeing it that you can compete and be
good at something I guess you mentioned
that one of the things that demotivated
you in football were that you didn't
really see yourself or at least you
thought you had a ceiling that you were
never really going to succeed at a high
level what made you think like that and
why didn't you have that in
poker I think in football like I I
was like there was people around me who
were like
like getting invited to like the
national team training camps
and and like uh abroad even like some
people went abroad to play they were
invited to like for example England
couple of guys went to England to and I
was never like part of that group and
even even those players
like the road was pretty hard for them
too even though they were like the top
top of my age group so and I I wasn't a
part of that so then I kind of realized
that it's pretty hard to make make it
where I would like to be like playing
abroad the big leagues and it would be
pretty pretty rough role
to even make it even if you're the one
of the best of my like AG group so and I
wasn't so it was pretty clear to me that
it would be very unlikely that that I
would make it very far and that kind of
put stop to a lot of the effort I was
putting in the
football because it I didn't really want
to be in the like the middle or low
level you know you know what I mean so
and that was kind of the exit point when
I found poker so it was like and I've
poker excited me so much and it was
super like I I kind of saw that it would
be a path that that would be more
realistic even I don't know oh wow
that's interesting did did did did you
have any like examples obviously you
watched a lot of uh footage on TV but
obviously they make it look very very
flashy did you have any like maybe
examples closer to you of like hey you
can actually do this as a career because
I can imagine it's easier to look at
football players and be like that's a
that's a career instead of like poker
player especially online kind of this
mysterious dark dark world yeah yeah I
actually no like I don't really have
like I was just obsessed with the game
from the beginning and I just I
basically watched every YouTube video
that was about poker and YouTube like I
watch everything every blog I I tried to
like find everything I could find about
poker and there for sure was like like
blogs in two two that were super
motivating for me for example like Alex
Trev is one of them uh the blogs that I
found like in I think 20 2012 or
and that was like uh for sure one of the
first kind of guys
that kind of would
be or they show kind of the path that I
could maybe make myself too that become
a professional so I guess like lot of
the blocks in two plus two for were more
like they were probably the kind of role
models for me like or like the path that
I would try to replicate I guess and
especially I think with a Blog right you
really get a big Insight of depending
obviously the person who's blogging and
how open he is but I guess you get a
really good Insight of how the life of
probably an online online poker Pro
would look like what or um when and how
did you decide to go pro poker player
imag you got really into it the 17 did
you just immediately quit school quit
football turned Pro or did did you need
a little bit of time to to actually get
to a level where you could consider
turning pro I think uh I I started to
take poker more seriously like between
17 and 18 I was playing like free rolls
and like play money games even at the
start and then when I turned 18 I
deposited like €20 couple of times I
busted that and then um I deposited like
100 to A8
and with the mindset that if I would
bust this I wouldn't like this was like
my pretty much the only chance I would
give myself to take this seriously and
then after that I really didn't look
back from that 100 years I've granted uh
I was like super conservative at the
beginning because I really wanted to
make it so I was playing like two NL for
a long time then slowly slowly grinded
the the limits and then
um I think after like two and a half
years after that I had grown my bankr to
around like 25k so I was playing 200l
quite a lot and
uh like B before that I was going to the
Army for little under year so that took
quite a lot of time and I couldn't
really play a lot during that time
so after that when I came from army I
went actually had a job for a couple of
months and
uh after that I had like I said I had
like Ru my bankroll to around
25k and then just one day uh decided
that uh I'm going to turn pro I told my
mom that I will quit my job and uh I
will go pro and actually the luckiest
thing in my career happened after that
like three days after I said to my mom
that uh I will quit my job and uh start
to play poker professionally actually
won a tournament for like
28k so I basically doubled my bankroll
in the first three days after turning
pro so that was like absolutely massive
like massive boost to my confidence and
bankroll obviously that was super Lucky
in the beginning and that's probably one
of the biggest like turning points in my
career actually because that was so
it became in a so s such a good timing
that I won the tournament so it Le
relieved a lot of the stress and
pressure off of
me and after that I've uh grinded and
never looked back actually after that so
I think it's very important to uh
imagine if you start your career and you
immediately go on like one of the worst
down swings ever basically your career
is kind of it's kind of GG right you
haven't really built yeah the resistance
you know so I think that will be I think
I think probably a trend if you look at
all current professional players they
probably ran good in the beginning
because I feel like if in the beginning
you hadit like that 5% bottom stretch
you're like this is I'm out you know
you're you're not going to be able to
recognize VAR so then you're just going
to be like well I guess I guess it's
just not for me um yeah that's that's
that's actually pretty interesting you
mentioned that you went to the Army I
was wondering if or what or if there
were certain lessons that you learned in
your experiences in football in the army
that have helped you um in your poker
career obviously there's no school for
poker you know normally if you choose a
profession you have like four years of
school or something before you actually
go into the profession what did you
learn um throughout your experience in
life that helped you in
poker well I think football for sure
like thought me about being like a
professional and like a athlete that for
sure helps with poker too there's a lot
of similarities is in that that and like
the competitive aspect also like you
have to be sharpy like professional be
like multi-dimensional in your approach
you have to
be good nutrition good like rest all
these things help with poker too so
that's for sure with what football help
me with and army
actually in in the Army you kind of
learned to deal with [ __ ] so it was
there was a lot of like
like lot of just like dealing with [ __ ]
that's basically what army was like and
I guess that's what war actually is like
you have to kind
of know how to deal with [ __ ] and be in
the uncertainty you don't know what's
going to happen you don't and that's
kind of like the army training is
probably supposed to be also like
you they're training you to learn how to
deal with uncertainty and like dealing
with shitty situation C like City
weather
City uh like pre how to move when you're
tired super tired or super with low
sleep like just basically dealing with
[ __ ] that's what the Army kind of T me
at least well that seems handy in poker
you get a lot of [ __ ] from at you so
actually nowadays even literally at
these tables you know with all this
animation people TR [ __ ] at you all the
time so good skill to have good skill to
have what were some of you your goals
and expectations when you started out
playing pro pro obviously binking a
tournament three days in was beyond your
expectations I think like my first goal
was just to become a pro to make like
most of my income from poker and that
was the that was the first goal then I
had like goals of making certain amounts
of money so first was like 100k to make
100K after that was
like was to make a million and after
that I've uh like I got that so then
after that I'm just kind of cruised uh
so after that the goals have changed a
bit when I've got quite a lot of
certainty like Financial Security so
then my goals have shifted more to like
become becoming the best uh player I can
be and being more competitive and that I
think in the beginning it was more about
like the
Finance Financial Security aspect I
wanted to be sure that I'm uh
financially secure so that was the big
uh focus in the beginning because I
really didn't have a backup plan like I
was all in in poker and
so the just making sure that I enough
money to play comfortably and leave
comfortably was the the first goal for
sure but nowadays I think it's more
about like
becoming
more becoming the best player I can
being also like more whole person I
guess to overall like selfimprovement
I guess more to uh this
day what unexpected challenges or
experience did you encounter when
turning
pro H unexpected let's
see I guess like a lot of the swings of
Poker kind of are very unnatural to you
to anybody at first like you're you're
not uh used to like losing a lot of
money using really not used to the
swings I guess that was for sure like
one of the first ones and then
um I guess
like cuz poker is such a different
career from everybody else
or at least a lot of people so it's kind
of I guess the social aspect was maybe a
little unexpected I don't know if it
like dealing with uh or telling people
basically what you do like that was uh
kind of weird for me still is actually a
little bit weird to kind of talk to
people who are not in poker it's uh like
kind of weird to explain it it's always
the conversation seems to be pretty
I guess hard and not uh really natural
to I find difficult is explain to people
what I do I guess that's one of
them Adam when you uh explain people
that you were a professional poker
player how did they usually react and
how do you
think we can basically better explain it
so people find it an interesting thing
to
do that's a tough one I feel like some
guys like in their 20s find it super
fascinating I've been in the bank before
open an account and some guys be like
whoa tell me more you play poker for a
living coolest thing ever but most
people just think you're a bit of a
degenerate especially the elder
population um even my family some of
them still like oh you got very lucky
with that gambling that you did for a
while how did how did life work out
after so yeah I think the main thing is
not trying to uh force it onto the
people You' just got to I think the best
thing you can do is show over time with
your attitude and approach to it that
you're taking it seriously then over
time they have confidence in you as an
individual and the path you're going
down they still probably don't know much
about poker especially I'm referring to
parents elderly people who are aren't
going to go looking on blogs and reading
about you and the poker landscape uh but
yeah your attitude towards what you do I
think has a big influence on whether
people think you're wasting your time or
you're actually taking things seriously
so yeah over time hopefully they start
to uh start to warm up so I'm really
interested to dive into your story and
your your journey to high stakes I've
kind of got three phases that I want to
go through so the first one is the two
years before you went pro and I think
you you mentioned you playing super low
stakes with that $100 100 Euro bank roll
and you went from 2nl to 200 NL in a
roughly two-year span so I'm curious to
know during this time talk us through
how you approach in poker and some of
the main lessons you learned I always
feel like when you go from one level to
the next there's a a leveling up of your
character there's a level up your
obviously strategy so talk us through
that Evolution from 2 andl to
200l yeah I think that was very
interesting time I was
uh I think it like
the there was a lot of learning
happening then and obviously like the
games were very different back then to
now and I was just like I was like I
said I was very like quite
conservative with my bank I was because
I wanted to make it so bad that I was
like trying
to kind of control that I would wouldn't
go bus that was the biggest thing and
then I guess
uh every every time you move that Stakes
it's always it's kind of funny even now
to if you compare to nowadays like the
moving moving up process is still the
same like even back then like when I
mooved from I I remember actually when I
took my first shot at like 100 NL I I
played like I played one
table I I stack stacked a guy for a
buying and then I played like like two
orbit and left I was so scared to lose
to lose the buying back that I was just
happy to like book up a win and
leave that's that's one fun memory of
that but yeah I I think
like I guess like you just get used to
always at the highest St even though
like every time you move up it feels
such a big deal but uh you kind of
realize that you always get used to the
next level and then uh yeah I guess
that's the biggest thing that U was just
slowly taking shots at good games at
that time and then I I mean the games
were pretty soft back then so it was I
guess my Approach was kind of like just
uh learn learn from uh love the videos
on that I could find I
was I had a sub subscription to run it
once and that was a big help back then
because there wasn't lot of other
learning tools back then like maybe just
uh Rie reviewing your own hands and uh
just like watching runit One videos
so I guess uh that was like the main way
to improve and then slowly taking shots
and uh it was pretty pretty smooth
actually there wasn't like huge down
swings at least that I can recall back
then were there any levels that were
particularly challeng into crack or do
you feel like you uh like you said
approach it the same way you took a shot
with your bank roll and you were able to
uh get some momentum in each level yeah
I think uh at the lower Stakes there
wasn't really like tough uh like uh
tough uh Stakes to crack but when I got
to like 1K 2K then then I think that was
the first time I had like problems with
some of the stakes so not not really at
the lower Stakes but uh a little bit
higher was for sure some
difficulties all right so phase one
smooth sailing from 2 NL to 200 NL then
phase two which was about a year year
and a half it took you to go from 200
200 NL to shooting 2ks so this is a big
jump like to to go for those levels
those are competitive Stakes 500s 1ks
see I'm curious to know what was your
Approach at this stage your career and
what do you feel like you were doing
that allowed you to want aggressively
shot take but also uh to not set a
ceiling for yourself it's very common
for players to uh start getting affected
by the money maybe start doubting
themselves start limiting themselves so
to speak so what what do you think
allowed you to uh can push through from
200s to 2ks in the space of a
year I think was uh just like I my
Approach was just like if the game was
good I was going to play so and I think
uh I actually now now that I think my
like bankr management was like not that
coner conservative I guess like I was
taking like 50 by shorts so it's not the
like the most conservative uh
backr management I guess but every time
I just saw a good game I was uh I was
taking a shot if I got a see it and uh I
think one of the reasons that I moved
from 200 to I guess 2K quite fast was
because I ran like extremely well at 500
I I remember like the like the first
year of 2016 when I turned Pro like in
the summer I took uh my first shots at 5
100 and I had like I won 100 buying in
like two months so that was like a
massive massive unbelievable run good at
500 so it also G gave me a lot of
confidence to I guess moving up too
because when I like move up to 500 also
500 was like a limit that was kind of
scary you know there was like lot of
these 500 room rexs that you see on like
run it once videos and they had this
like or aura about them I guess or at
least like a maybe like a fake Aura at
least kind of make it more make it look
more scarier than probably it was but
then when I took shot at 500 uh and it
went like unbelievably well then I get I
guess that uh gave me the confidence to
take aggressive shots like to the next
levels too so I think that was a big uh
big thing that uh make me want to take
shots pretty agress
what do you think was giving you your
Edge in these games because obviously
you're probably less experienced than a
lot of regulars at the 500 onek yeah
you're jumping in there obviously like
you mentioned running good but we're
assuming that you've got an edge in
those games as well what do you feel
like you were doing around your game
that was potentially giving you an edge
on your opponent at that
time I think I think the games were
super soft back then like the 500 Zoom
games were absolutely like there was
some times where the games was super
super soft so that was for sure one of
the big factors but also like I think I
like one of my strengths always has been
like learning from better Pros that has
been I think my big one of big reasons
for my Edge is that um if I see
something that somebody does that's I
think it's good I'm pretty quick to
adapt and takes take the the good parts
of somebody's game and uh like attach it
to my game so I think that that was
that's always been like a big strength
of mine to I think Pico some sometimes
said that um uh how did he say how's the
world go I think it's good artist copy
great artist steal so basically that's
been my Approach a lot of time so if I
see somebody some good play do something
I'm that I think it's good I think it's
interesting I will take a look at and
then uh try to find the reason why he's
doing that and then uh try to replicate
that and uh add the good parts to my
game I think that has been a big uh big
part of my Edge through throughout my
career for sure you're like a sponge
absorbing all the the good Knowledge
from the players around you adding that
to your game as needed you did mention
that 1K has created a few problems what
was the challenge you ran into when shot
know
levels I think one was wasn't that bad
but I think two 2K was the biggest like
I really felt like I was outmatch like a
lot of the Recs when I first started
playing 2K like I felt like a lot of the
re were like clearly better than me even
though I was playing in pretty I was
taking shots when like there was
obviously like a recreational playing
but still like I felt like I I was
clearly outmatch and I felt like I was
playing maybe a little scared like
scared money and it was uh there was for
sure some wrecks that were pounding on
me for that I think bit bit too easy was
one of them that gave me a really really
tough time uh back then it was just
bounding super aggressively and I was
just uh
scared but yeah that was I think the
toughest level to for me and then uh I I
think that's probably one of
the one of the toughest level that's
throughout my career that uh have given
me the most difficulties
so how did you learn from that because I
feel like a lot of players as as you
mentioned there for you the 500s are
very easy you had a great win with and
you are running good as well then you're
running the 2ks and all of a sudden you
for the first time probably encounter
better players you're like wow these
guys not as running good they're
actually better players than me for a
lot of players that would be a good sign
to go all right not ready let's get back
down to 500s grind out some easy money
and I'll leave those 2ks for another
time you didn't do that so what what do
you think allowed you to keep going at
2ks and how did you learn from the
better players around you to uh to
finally break into that
level I think actually run pretty bad at
2K 2 so it was like mix of uh like run
bad and obviously like getting uh
outclass but
uh I I found it quite motivating to see
I've always find it quite motivating to
see like better players because I feel
like I can kind of learn a lot from them
so I think it was just like I wanted to
move up and uh even though I was
probably not ready to play that it was a
great uh learning experience because the
even nowadays like the good thing about
playing like really good players is that
they kind of expose
you even to maybe truths about your game
that you're not even aware of like they
they force like put your weaknesses in
the you know Forefront that then you can
see and look at them you know and that
that can be very helpful that uh you
might be when you're playing lower you
can get away with stuff that you can't
get away with the higher Stakes so when
you're playing higher Stakes uh the good
re can kind of beat the weaknesses out
of you in the Limelight and then you can
see aha that's uh that's clearer
weakness and I can improve on that
so I think uh that helped me a lot and
then uh I just uh trial and error just
took always shots if it went bad then I
would uh slow down a bit and then when I
was one uh one back back the money at
the lower St then I would take a shot
shot again and repeat the process again
again until I uh found some success and
could move
up so it sounds like you were treating
these 2K as a little bit like practice
and trying to play better players let
them expose your weaknesses get better
learn from it try again and I love that
attitude because Life's a game of like
trying to uh adapt to your environment
realizing when you have a failure or
fail attempt that it's not final to come
back stronger next time how do you feel
like you were able to do this when there
was aot lot of money on the line
obviously you're this is not a free
attempt you're losing decent amounts of
money at 2ks and also your ego there's
an element of self-doubt that can creep
in am I good enough have I reached my
ceiling I know in football for example
you mentioned you saw good guys around
you who were potentially go to the
bigger leagues did you have any
self-doubt when you seeing the the big
names in the online Line Game beating
you did you think that maybe uh you've
reached your ceiling here or did you
feel like this was a different different
chapter for
you yeah I think uh in poker like in
football it was different because there
was certain like like somebody would be
like clearly like physically better so
that was something like I couldn't
really work on in football that uh in
poker was different because I could see
that a lot of the things that my
opponent were better I could work on
that so it wasn't like
like something that I couldn't reach so
that was uh the difference between
football and poker for sure and then
like yeah that's pretty much it I think
like I think in poker it
was easier I guess to like learn and get
better than in football there was like
felt like was more limitations like like
physical limitations that uh didn't
doesn't exist in poker so that was a big
thing for sure yeah you could see the
path and you could see the skills you
were lacking you could add them to your
game and it wasn't going to be a
long-term limitation it was just a lack
of skill in that moment I had a Sim
experience with midle distance running I
trained with some very good athletes who
were went to be Olympic athletes and you
can very quickly see that I'm not going
to catch up this Gap there's a there's a
few characteristics that you have where
I'm going to train equally as hard maybe
harder than you but there's there's some
things that I'm not going to uh be able
to overcome but yeah with with po it's
often just okay I can see you're
executing a better strategy I can
definitely learn that I can yeah use
your use a guideline of what I should be
working on and like you said those good
players are quickly exposing your
weaknesses which is great because if you
can get away from taking that personally
you know exactly what to work on because
they put them like a spotlight on
everything that's unfinished in your
game so it's it's a great time to go
right this is what I need to uh to work
on next so you had a successful shot at
2ks you kind of cemented yourself there
a little bit but you didn't stop there
for very long and in the next year phase
three you went from playing 2ks to shot
taking 10ks so talk us through this
phase how this next transation went at
any point did you think okay I'm happy
where I'm at or what made you keep
striving and what were you learning
through this these next trap days I
guess
like I didn't really have goals like
after after like I had obviously making
a pro was the first goal then was like
making 100K and then we making a million
after that I didn't really like have a
goals like clear goals that I was aiming
for so I guess like the next levers
became to goals so get higher play
higher and higher stakes and then uh I
guess that was the big motivation to
take shots at higher stakes and then you
kind of realize also that like the
higher Stakes even though there's better
RS for sure also like the rake is slower
obviously and then like the
recreational also often like even worse
that at like mid Stakes so the games can
be really good at high stakes obviously
I guess the difficult difficulty is the
like the variance is is like the swings
are bigger so that's uh and also there's
not a lot of game so that can I think
that can hinder a lot of players because
you can't really get back into the fight
if you even if you want unless you want
to B the big dogs uh three handed every
day and that's not maybe the best uh
thing for your bankroll if you that's
only way you're going to like take shots
at higher Stakes so there I think I
guess the main thing it was like it was
like the next goal for me to just get
higher and higher play higher stakes and
play with better players at higher
Stakes I guess that was the biggest
motivation for
me yeah I think sometimes in po you
don't always need that clear Direction
cuz poker set out in a levels format and
you can just keep going the levels going
to that next level and once you've
achieved success at one the next level
is just waiting for you to kind of take
a shot at so it seems like for you with
your mindset as you mentioned Rene
earlier you're very competitive you like
that kind of ranking system you like
pursuing that next goal seeing how far
you can push things and Pog became a a
good Avenue to test yourself you
mentioned that kind of challenge which I
want to touch on when you play higher
Stakes like the volume's less so let's
say you shot take some 10ks and you lose
three buyin and there's no action for
the next few days how do you deal with
that how do you kind of come to terms
with the fact that a lot of your win
rates or maybe your profits for that
period of time are going to be dictated
by a small sample and you don't really
have much control over that how how
would you juggling with that I know some
players struggle with the the lower
volume and reach higher Stakes I
definitely struggle with that too like
it kind of decreases the kind of
decrease the motivation to play lower
when you play higher Stakes like if I
lose a lot then I'm not super uh
motivated to play the lower Stakes so
that's definitely something I've uh
noticed with myself but then you kind of
have to realize that even the lower
staks you are just playing to their like
good good spots good EV in those games
so I guess one good good way to think
about is is to think about it as in
terms of buying so if you like if you
lose three buying and 10K it's kind of
the similar thing to losing uh three
bance at 2K or 1K just in terms of
thinking about in bance can help a lot
at least I have noticed that it helped
me a lot that I just like not think in
terms of money so thinking in terms of
buying has helped me a lot so if I lose
uh three B at 10 G it's like I lost
three buying so I I wouldn't be like
super mad if I lost three B of my lower
Stakes so why be mad when uh when I lost
the three B at the highest T Al it's
easier said than done but that's for for
sure at least help me like mentally a
little bit yeah easier said than done
but I think a great mindset I know a lot
of players when they're shooting higher
Stakes they like to uh convert that buy
in into dollar amounts just to make it
pay fors but yeah if you can learn to
just always look at buying always see
the the bigger picture allow a sample to
grow just think in buying for a period
obviously you need to have a bank roll
that can support that you can't just go
on forever with the that mentality but
yeah I think it's a good good R of Thum
to to not over attach to the the
financial he you mentioned like in the
question as well that you're a bit of a
YOLO guy and a gambler at heart how has
that impacted you in both a positive and
negative way we still with the Positive
angle how has this helped you to uh move
up progress move up St so
aggressively yeah I guess like I don't
uh guess take things too seriously when
it comes to Poker sometimes but I guess
I I guess I'm not like that big of a
gamble to be honest like I like to they
like calculate I guess gamble but but if
it really like starts to affect my like
lifestyle and stuff then I won't
uh I guess I won't gamble that hard but
if I if I have room to gamble I for sure
like to maybe they shorts as higher
Stakes that maybe the game is not that
good and that but I guess I'm not that
big of a gambler if it's like affecting
my lifestyle but um because I know some
guys who are like even though they have
like a 200 g bank roll they are like
taking shots at 10K and stuff so I'm I'm
not that kind of uh I guess that kind of
gambler but I like to take shots try a
new
like uh like even try new games a bit
and uh yeah I guess trying uh if there's
a good spot I I for sure like to gamble
a bit not not not being like
super strict about using money in a lot
of spots so I guess that
yeah see it seems you're a gambler
within boundaries and you have like kind
of parameters of risk without going to
follow over those have you had any
negative experiences by gambling too
much maybe taking on too much risk or
taking on opportunities whatever they
are that have proved to be
costly yeah I think uh like there's only
one day in my career that I couldn't
sleep because of Poker and that it was
actually during Christmas like I was uh
with my family we were just like e in
drinking a bit and then uh after uh
everything was going to sleep I saw some
uh there was like 10K and 20K games on
888 they used to have this push or fold
I think they still have it's like a five
uh big blind buying and
then you basically is a push push of all
game and there was this like pretty big
recreational player who I have played
before and I decided to took a pretty
aggressive shot at that game and uh I
think I lost
like 10 to 15% of my netw worth in like
four
hours and then uh that couldn't really
sleep after that uh and but that's the
basically only way
only only time I couldn't sleep because
of Poker but I guess that was pretty
devastating at that
time what lesson did that teach
you not to play Drunk and uh time
I
guess especially at the highest Tak you
ever
played but yeah I guess I learned that
pretty quick and yeah that was just just
like a one time thing but also like I
was it was quite early in my career that
I was willing to gamble a little bit
more I
guess yeah sometimes you need a quick
and early lesson in your career to uh
you get bit once and you you don't touch
the whole thing again so I think for you
that was a a good example
you mentioned you haven't had a real
Rock botom moment in your career but
2021 was a year in particular that was
quite challenging for you talk us
through that year what was particularly
tough yeah I think in 2020 I had like
obviously co co happened and the
actually the games were insanely good
during 2020 and I had had my best year
during 2020 there were some insanely
good games and I had by far my best year
result wi and like I felt like I I think
I didn't I have had only like a one
losing month during that year so I had a
very massive year 2020 and I that kind
of built maybe some expectations for the
next year that uh were way too high so
then I the next year 2021 I was super
excited and expected to have even a
better year the next year which was
quite dumb and then uh obviously
the games kind of died out in 2021 quite
a lot because 2020 was such a good year
so then I
just didn't win for the next four months
and I was super like I get got really
frustrated and I started to kind of hate
poker uh I every time I played I had a
quite bad mindset I was already kind of
like mad before playing and then I
actually took quite a lot of I think I
took like four months off during that
year because I just couldn't I like my
mindset was so off during that year I
was so mad every time I played so I
guess that
was was the close I guess closest thing
to a rock mod for me but I I think after
I took the break it kind of eased out a
bit like my
expectations became lower and uh kind of
back came back to reality about the
situation and then I found uh enjoyment
and enjoyment at poker again
so yeah other than the break was there
anything you did to change your approach
to Poker or your mindset it sounds like
as you mentioned your expectations going
to 2021 got quite high and that came
kind of crashing down with some some bad
results so other than the break anything
else that you found helpful in terms of
your approach your strategies your yeah
daily that you were
changing yeah I think I was starting to
play a little
bit less volume and more
like less volume and more uh quality
better with better quality I was playing
also one thing I did was I start to play
slower that I would make decisions uh a
little bit slower so I would make like
stupid mistakes and that because that
was always one thing that kind of
irritated me and tilted me a little bit
that if I would play too fast and then
made would make a mistake that after two
seconds I realized I made some stupid
mistakes just because I played too fast
so I guess that was a big thing for me
that I started to play a little bit
slower so I wouldn't make those like St
stupid mistakes and that was really good
for my mindset too that playing slower
and then uh at that time I actually
started to battle quite a bit more more
I started to hold lobbies more and that
was also like a refreshing thing for me
for sure because before that I was quite
I was I was battling here and then but
not that much and then after that uh I
guess the battles kind of reignited also
the more the competitive side and the
like passion and excitement and interest
in the
game sure reignite that flame yeah

let's get back into more goodness in
today's episode so for you you mentioned
earlier with Rene that you've you
approach p a bit like athlete quite
holistically so I'm curious to know how
your days are set up for performance in
terms of like an average day so yeah' be
great for the listeners to know what a
day the life look like for you let's go
back to a period where maybe you're
striving maybe that 2K to 10K jump where
you're striving play the best players
talk us through how your team's habits
were looking to kind of allow you to
perform at high
level actually I always been kind of
like a freestyler with that to be honest
like not necessarily like a super
athletic
uh uh approach to it like always like I
think
just getting good sleep has always been
super important for me like that uh
playing well with a good sleep and has
been always the most important thing for
my performance for sure but yeah I
generally like I'm pretty freestyler
when it comes to my routine I actually
that's been maybe a little bit like
a um struggle with me during my career
that's I've kind of struggled to find
like a I guess sleep schedule because I
always had the problem with the the
schedule that if I like the best
schedule for like life in general would
be like waking up in the morning
and Going H bed at night but then uh the
games are way better at night so I
struggle with that uh that's kind of
Duality that if I want to perer better
and uh also have a better like life
quality I would kind of have to
sacrifice a little bit from the EV from
poker
so yeah but then uh then again like I
always kind
of shift to the night schedule because
the game are just so much better during
the night so that uh usually I try to be
in the kind of normal good schedule but
then I see look at the lot make make the
mistakes to looking at the lobes during
night and then uh uh I guess I'll play a
little session and then it's 4 a.m. and
uh my schedule is [ __ ] again so I
guess that's have been a bit of a
struggle for me for sure like the
deciding what schedule to play
on but yeah when it comes to my routine
I guess like trying to be a pretty
decent health and uh yeah like I said
like sleep getting good sleep before
playing has been a big big part and I
think that's uh very important for
performance yeah I think for schedule
obviously as you mentioned there's
opportunities that are available late at
night in particular and there's a
trade-off do I want to seize these
lobbies and the higher win rates here or
do I want to prioritize sleep and
there's going to be a like you said a
duality between those two sometimes and
in Conflict but at the same time it
sounds like even when your schedule
moves around you still try to prioritize
sleep and Recovery to make sure you're
not b and out is there anything else you
do on a regular basis that allows you uh
to play your best poker is there any
like habits you have even if they move
around day to day week to week that you
come back to often
that you feel like correlate with you
playing your best
Pok yeah I think like I have a couple of
times where I've been on a pretty strict
like uh working out schedule so I would
like wake up and work out uh and do that
pretty much every day and I've noticed
that that's uh been probably the best
I've played always when I have I've been
on that like District like working out
schedule and eating pretty well and
sleeping well
L that's that's been the best but then
again I always struggle with that
because usually I have to be in the
morning schedule with that but then kind
of
the the can't play at night when I'm on
that schedule though so it's kind of
like trade off do I want to like play
very good when I'm uh with a with a good
schedule or do I want to like a little
bit sacrifice my schedu and then like
just play in the better games during the
night that has been I guess that's been
a kind of a switch of for me sometimes
I'm in
the the night schedule sometimes I'm in
the like more stricter morning schedule
so it's uh
yeah how do you balance your personal
life and free time when your schedule's
moving around let's say you're going
from night schedule sometimes to Day
schedule sometimes how do you kind of
find that balance with your you're take
away from
poke honestly it's be pry tough like
sometimes like this night schedule is
very bad very bad for like social
life uh so it's been a little bit of
struggle with that I guess I sometimes
like one thing I have done that I kind
of have periods where I'm on the night
schedule and sometimes I'm per in the
morning schedule so then when I'm on the
morning schedule I kind of prioritize
maybe social life more
so that's uh that's uh probably the way
I've handled
it but uh when I'm on the night schedule
it's actually it's pretty tough uh
because I'm waking up during like day
and people
are yeah it's Prett it rough but on the
other hand you can like still have a
decent social life even when the night
schedule because you awake like during
the evening so we can basically during
the start of your day you can uh have a
social life and then play at night it's
it's it's not too bad but I prefer for
social I for sure prefer the morning
schedule yeah I think obviously there's
trade-offs of each schedule and I think
it's just being conscious of the pros
and cons of each if you're doing the
night shift you're going to take a bit
hit on sleep scheduling and uh you free
time spending with friends and if you're
on the the more normal grinded early in
your day you might have worse games but
you might have a better sleep schedule
better uh free time in the evening so
yeah think as long as you're conscious
and you're you're aware of why you're
doing things and you're you're going
into it like this I this chapter my life
I want to make lots of money I want to
play these games then it's yeah it's
absolutely fine and as long as you you
find that balance over a longer sample
I'm curious to with you because you feel
like somebody who uh doesn't really
judge themselves too much and I know a
lot of players struggle with confidence
they struggle especially shot taking
like you have throughout your career
when they're making mistakes and they're
uncertain about their strategy how do
you deal with that element when you you
feel like you're potentially making
mistakes in game how do you go about
using that constructively to improve
yourself yeah I think actually
interesting I I just a while ago read a
post I think CD 9k has a Blog where he
talk about this like it is it uh is it
better to be like a little bit too
self-critical or the opposite like which
one is better is it better for your
career to be a little too self-critical
or
like pretty relaxed and I was at first I
was uh quite
strongly thought that being too
self-critical is better than uh the
opposite but uh now I've actually really
thought about the stuff and I've seen
like the arguments for the other side
too that
uh like being more forgiving for
yourself can be also there's a lot of
Merit to that but for sure I've been uh
during my career pretty pretty harsh on
myself for sure but then kind
of also quite forgiving too so I'm kind
of like quickly if I do a mistake I'm
kind of quick even though I get pretty
mad at myself I guess I recover from
that pretty fast so if I make a mistake
I might be mad at myself for a while but
then I get to the base level pretty fast
and can move born from it so it doesn't
really linger too long in my mind even
though uh at first it was quite
uh affecting me quite a
lot two questions from that the first
one is when you're critiquing yourself
and you're being a bit hard on yourself
how do you turn that into something
constructive yeah it's it's pretty tough
tough good question and uh because it
can for sure go in a pretty bad place if
you're too
like you got too critical and too like
harsh on yourself and then you like
shift your focus from
like from improving to just like bash
bashing yourself basically so there for
sure like that's a difficulty with that
but I I thought always that uh like
being a little bit too self-critical is
better because you kind of
at least you're not too delusional about
your like skill level and SK uh like
your skills in general if you're if
you're self-critical
so I guess then uh I always thought that
even though it might be might go
overboard sometimes then um it's better
to like constantly
like test your game test your knowledge
so that you're not becoming delusional
so guess that uh I don't know if that
answers the question but
uh oh it does yeah and second part is
how do you move on quickly from that so
you mentioned you're quite good at that
what are you doing with your mind
thought wise how do you get yourself to
uh yeah move on
quickly I think like just taking uh like
just not thinking about poker is big for
me just like doing something else that's
completely unrelated for poker and just
like try to forget forget about it and
get like maybe get like wins somewhere
else like
maybe work out uh or do something study
studying is great because it's kind of
variance
free wins let's say so studying is good
and then just like spend time with
friends and family and do some other
like hobbies that you like so I think
that's a big part that kind of uh helps
a lot with uh
like moving moving forward for
sure get some variance free wins I like
that one that's a good um yeah so
interesting debate I'm interested in the
comments for guys watching this are you
on the self-critical side do you feel
like not being critical enough is more
of a leak and yeah over to you Ry as
well which side do you fall on in terms
of how you've approached poker with
yourself do you feel like you've been
hauling yourself too much in the moment
or do you feel being too forgiven which
is lower
standards that's the thing right you're
great that you will lower your standards
when you drop your self criticism well
like the evolvement that I made in my
career which in the beginning was
definitely very
self-critical um which came more from I
guess an underlying fear of not being
like good enough so then if you're
always
self-critical your biggest fear of not
being good enough you're kind of trying
to prevent that from com coming out and
becoming
true so I guess at some point I but that
then comes with like stress anxiety and
at some point I kind of accepted the
fact that yeah I'm not perfect you know
I'm going to [ __ ] up I'm not going to
know what to do in certain situations
and kind of just accepting that gave
like a certain amount of peace and from
that piece actually you perform better
so there's then less need to be
self-critical because you're performing
better so you naturally have less leaks
to be self-critical about so I kind of
evolved more towards like more the
forgiven and empathetic side and I think
it's helped a lot in terms of
performance but also just in terms of
quality of life I would say uh so yeah I
would say that obviously being not
self-critical as all it's like obviously
the other Spectrum I feel like everyone
naturally is at some point and you need
to find kind of the middle right and
some people will need to be more
self-critical but we're probably bit
bias if we have all the people that we
have had on here in the podcast they
probably have all been a bit too
self-critical maybe in the beginning and
they had to recalibrate to the other
side and maybe people who haven't made
it were not self-critical enough yeah
you understand what I mean so I guess I
guess the yeah I I don't so for the
audience listening it's very hard to
just take this advice it's you really
have to estimate for yourself uh if
you're on the self-critical Spectrum or
not and what may be and what and what
prevent you and why like why you're at
that Spectrum right what what does that
Spectrum try to protect you from like I
said in my case a fear of failure for
for
example I guess like also like if you're
like in the other side of the spectrum
so like not CR critical enough I guess
it's might be harder to like crank up
the volume so to say to be more
self-critical so I guess if you're too
self critical it's easier to like tone
it down I
guess it's interesting yeah go ahead
it's just interesting to see that I I
kind of uh that you you said that you
are going through the kind of Journey
from too self-critical to more forgiving
and I think I'm going through the same
kind of same Journey myself right now so
it's interesting to hear uh that you
have kind of the same uh same uh place
going than me so it's kind of
interesting you're you're on the right
path in my experience um I I you guys
you guys were chatting about the the
decision to for example play night PS
because you estimated that your II would
be better there when you accumulate
more financial gain like that was your
initial goal right you want to make 100K
one 1
million how has your thoughts about EV
and your decisions around EV change
because I can imagine that at some point
like okay so the decision to play at
night is for purely Financial EV right
yeah at what point do you feel like live
EV or other EVS start to become more
important so for example for me I always
played 9 to5 like European Time which no
was not the greatest time but at least
it gave me I feel better at that point
you know you I the social life after I'm
married I live with my wife we can go to
the bed at the same times wake up at the
same times for me there was a
tradeoff that was quite easy to make
because I thought that was quite
important but definitely earlier on my
career it was just you think about EV in
terms of where can I optimize my hourly
and [ __ ] the rest right how how is that
evolved and how do you see that evolving
more into the
future yeah I think for sure like I
still have like the I guess a little bit
of the kind of scarcity mindset when it
comes to that because like in the
beginning I was
so I wanted so bad to be a pro that I
was like like I I was willing to
sacrifice anything to to just be a pro
and be fin financially secure that I
think there's still some of that like
programming going on in my head I still
like even though I'm I'm very
comfortable spot right now the it's
still a little bit
like when I'm in the morning schedule I
still a little bit thinking that I
should I should be just maximizing e
because I don't know when is when when
is this going to end when is uh still uh
need to make more that I'm more secure
and I think that's uh I still have that
a little bit but I I guess it's it have
has
uh I've tone it down a bit but still is
in the back of my mind that I I got to
like take the opportunities I have and
maximize them but yeah for sure nowadays
it's a little less for sure that that I
can
still nowadays I play more the morning
schedule I would say and focus more on
like other stuff than poker too for sure
it does become more difficult if I speak
from experience that when you when when
other stuff starts to matter as well it
becomes a bit more complicated because
then it's like well well this is
important but that's also important your
priorities are a little bit all over the
place but I do feel like that mindset
enables a lot of players to accumulate a
lot of success financially in poker but
then I feel like at some point after
they've accumulated already so much
finances they keep on making decisions
of what they want to do in their life or
how they want to spend their time on
what's the EV and I feel like at some
point it kind of gets in the way of like
okay what's the EV you're already
multi-millionaire like do does really
every decision that you make in your
life has to be H but this doesn't make
me enough money it's like if you want to
go do that go do that right it's like
there's maybe other things you can gain
than finances so I feel like that it
helps people to get somewhere but then
at some point it kind of hinders them to
go somewhere else if you understand what
I mean yeah for sure and I've also had
that with like with friends you're like
doing something with friends and still
thinking about maybe I should be playing
here maybe I should be and that's uh
that's so bad to do that while you're
spending time with your friends so that
can for sure be a big HR
in your life outside of Poker for sure
but yeah I don't know it's a it's a
pretty tough uh balance to find I
find maybe also to to to to touch on one
point that you mentioned you mentioned
that you were pretty obsessive by nature
which I guess can help you in poker but
in for example the topic that we're not
talk about talking about can also hinder
you how have you how have this obsessive
nature helped you and both uh negatively
impacted your
career obviously like it it has helped
me to put in a lot of volume and
studying and lot of the like necessary
stuff to be good at
something that that for sure is the
biggest thing and putting volume and
putting just and also
it it feels easy also that's big thing
too like when you're obsessive about
something it's not like you don't even
have to think about doing it you just
want to do it all the time and it's not
even a big deal to play 12 hours a day
for sure for example at the beginning I
have couple of days where I was just
would just wake up play for 16 hours and
go to sleep and that was like just a
regular day it wasn't like a big deal
but yeah I guess that's that's the thing
that helped that that single
focused uh mindset will for sure uh help
when you want to get good at something
but then on the other side
it's can uh for sure like be be quite
damaging to other aspects of your life
for example health or relationships I
for sure noticed that uh like the
obsessive nature
have been pretty rough for my health for
example I was sometimes like in very bad
shape and uh like eating very bad and
also with social life like I would just
uh like even be being in the like night
schedule I just could like friends would
ask me to do something I was just like I
can't because I'm sleeping you know so
that that's for sure has been the like
the negatives of uh being obsessive
about something and also
like being so single-minded single Focus
minded uh can like make you kind of like
dismiss everything else like if somebody
ask you to do something a little bit
funnier just like nope I just don't care
at all at doing anything except poker so
it can be like
very tough for your relationships you're
just like want to do only one
thing so that's for sure like one of the
negatives of being quite obsessive about
stuff I mean like it it kind of come
back to right what's your goal I
remember for example when my goal was
pretty clear like I want to become the
best yes I was playing this 9 to5 but
then for example at Friday nights my
friends they would go out so I would
join them for dinner uh afterwards they
were going for for a drink well I didn't
drink because my goal is to try to
become the best poker player so why
would I drink that does not it's not in
line with my goal so there was also no
conflict there so while they were
getting drunk and then usually around so
we would go for dinner have a drink at a
bar or something then when what it was
Club time so like 11 12 I say hey guys
this is this is the time I'm out I'm
gonna wake up fresh tomorrow and grind
and then they would go off to to the
club you know so I would try to balance
it a bit I would join dinner join to the
bar not drink but I would still have a
good time now obviously you know how
these sometimes you know these Knights
can be legendary and obviously I would
miss them but I would take piece in the
fact that usually it's like 80% of the
time it's just like oh you know it's a
night like that sometimes it's legendary
yeah you're gonna miss that um but I
think what's very important I think it's
it's what is very important is is this
obsessive nature and is this 16 hour
grind for example is it giving you
energy or do you feel like it's taking
all your energy because I feel like at
some
point you you do something like you said
so obsessed you're so excited about it
and it gives you a lot of energy and
it's all you want to do then it's fine
right but at some point if you feel like
it's starting to cost you more energy
because feel like at some point you also
mentioned you kind of started to hate
poker even that's when it kind of
becomes a problem then you need to try
to get energy somewhere else what do you
do
when poker starts to really feel like a
grind and it's starting to give you less
energy uh than it used to before how do
you do you mix something up your
strategy I think you mentioned also you
you for example you started battling
after you went through the period where
you're hating poker just to trigger that
more competitive spark what do you do
when the grind feels too much like a
grind well I think uh most of the time
when I'm it starts to be too much it's
usually because I'm like it's not
because of Poker it's because I'm too
tired or like I've just played too much
for example doing Scoops and up scops
that's like after that I usually take a
pretty long break because I'm just
playing a ton every day and can't do
like 16 hour days anymore at this age so
it's mainly like uh like a physical
thing but if I'm really don't enjoy
poker that doesn't happen too often but
usually I just
uh take a taking a break always has
helped me but also like I try to play
poker for fun if you know what I mean
like I don't I don't try
to my I try to play poker sometimes with
the main objetive being just having fun
like for example I when five Zoom used
to run I would just like put couple of
tables pivate zoom and uh put some music
on enjoy music you know and then just do
whatever I want if I want a three it
every hand I will triet every hand and
just like be more creative and enjoy
poker more just not take it too like
seriously and too professional minded
more like a I guess like a creative uh
creative session I would say that has
for sure helped me a lot so you can I
actually think that's a big uh big very
good thing that you can do that if you
feel uh stressed and
uh like overwhelmed by voger you can
just like have these fun creative
sessions maybe play a little bit lower
stakes and then
try new stuff that uh it's maybe outside
of of your normal game and then you can
also actually learn quite a lot uh with
the doing that because you're just like
you're not obsessed about winning and
like making the best is you're TR to
kind of like it's more coming from place
of C curiosity like what what what can I
do what can I get away from what can I
maybe if I do this what let's see what
happens so it can be very refreshing for
your like mind and your mindset about
poker so that's for sure one thing I've
done always what's like the most outof
the Box strategy you've implemented and
of the outof the Box strategies which
one actually did you start using in your
quotequote day-to-day
grind I think one thing was like when I
was first playing F Zoom I I was quite a
knit like very big knit actually and
then uh I think I had a like a d pretty
big down swing and I was just like burn
out quite a lot and then then I just one
day decided to play way more aggressive
than usual and then I kind of realized
that people were folding and people were
also bluffing so it was kind of big
reveal for me that oh you can you can
just not have the nuts and win the pots
that's uh pretty awesome you know and
then yeah that was for sure and then
actually it changed my strategy quite a
lot because I realized that uh playing
aggressive is actually very good that
was for sure one uh one thing I was just
like I remember like I had a one session
where I was like every time I Played
Like A B versus small bind hand where I
would I was the pr better I was just
like bet bet bet any hand any board and
I realized that people are just falling
everywhere so that was a huge huge like
reveal reveal for me that uh I actually
you can just Bluff and they will always
P so that was uh that was for sure one
uh AA moment that came from like the
more creative uh process to Poker I
think it sounds like you started to
see or think about poker more
opportunistically instead of
pessimistically does that sound right
you started to see this the you kind of
sort of started to see the opportunities
with hands instead of the
problems yeah I guess yeah for sure
like yeah and also like there were some
people who were playing quite
aggressively and I was like it's one
thing also
have that has helped me during my career
is I've always liked to rail games so if
I'm in the computer and uh I'm not
playing I usually have like some tables
open from like high STS and stuff and
just rail uh ra like the high St games
while watching a podcast or something
and that that actually has helped me a
lot too and then like one of those
sessions I think that's where I got it
from I saw some probably like lonus or
somebody who was like uber aggressive at
some point and then H maybe if I try
that uh I will also play high
stakes so yeah I guess it came from like
just watching other people who were
super aggressive and then wanting
wanting to try that I guess that was the
process I think
so you mentioned that what you are most
proud of in your poke career is that you
were able to win consistently for so
many years what for you is the key or
are the biggest contributors to being
successful in poker over a long period
of
time I think the big thing is
to being being able to adapt and uh
change your strategy over time
so there's a lot of things strategy wise
that that have a Comm and go in poker
during the years and uh being able to
adap to the like the
new new I guess meta and new new
strategies is a big thing
because that's a that's like I think the
biggest thing that you you have to
constantly improve because the game is
always changing and
then if uh if you're not willing to do
that then uh usually those people die
out if they're not uh willing
to for example try new tools there's
obviously solvers have came and uh
there's when solvers came there were
some people who were quitting because
stuff because they just didn't want to
like bother with solvers and uh finding
new stuff
so they will uh quit the game because
they weren't uh willing
or able
to move on with the times or change with
the times so I think uh being like able
to adapt and uh improve your strategy
every year is a very big thing for
sure you mentioned uh The Meta what is
the current meta in your
opinion
H I think it for sure at high it's very
very call happy people are not
folding uh not folding uh to bets uh
usually if you Bluff you either get
called or
raised that's what I've notic playing
High sticks so you get real Bluff
because people uh have to be pry careful
of bluffing because you either get raced
or
called uh so I guess but yeah I think in
general
like a lot of spots are getting solved
or people are
like more and more spots are getting
like more clearly defined that what's
the correct start
because for example even a couple of
years ago like there was a lot of spots
where kind of people are still like free
freestyling and there's like rough
guidelines but nowadays I think there's
a lot more spots that are more like more
Sol and more like for example a lot of
pre flop stuff is cemented quite a bit
nowadays if you compare to even a couple
of years
ago and I yeah I think uh the solar have
had a very big impact uh and even like
the GT visard uh for sure had made a
very very big impact like or the overall
quality of every Rex game for sure
that's that's big
thing shout out to GTO wizard uh I
wanted to I'm wondering because you
earlier mentioned you know that you at
some point figured out that people are
folding and bluffing so you started to
play way more aggressive now you're
saying I should not be aggressive
anymore which kind of highlights the
point you know you have to keep adapting
your game how does the process of
building strategies or improving on your
strategies look like for you you also
mentioned tools what kind of tools do
you like to use and how do you like to
use them to improve your
strategy yeah for sure I use uh a lot of
solvers and uh like GJ wiard it has been
very it's very convenient and easy
to use it even
uh if you
want the quick answers for some spots
also use some Pio Pio and then talking
with the some uh friends is a nowadays a
big thing because I I didn't use
actually I was quite a quite a like a
lone wolf before I was just playing like
playing on my own studying watching
videos but nowadays I also talk strategy
with a couple of good players shout out
to Sunny and
Mato uh
but yeah that has been actually I've
realized that that's actually a very big
uh big help to talk to other players
because they can
uh show you some blind spots that you
can see yourself that's has been a
pretty big help for me for sure and then
yes studying solvers and
like and also like railing the games is
still a big part of my like process to
just watch the
games uh like a lot of the high stakes
games I watch them if I'm on the
computer I'm usually like raing uh at
least four tables and seeing if there's
some like stuff that's picks my interest
or some new stuff some like good re uh
High stch re that I respect um see if
there if there's there's some new in
their game too and then maybe look at
check uh check that uh stuff out myself
for example if I see somebody use a
sizing that I'm I don't use and I
haven't seen them use before so may
maybe I take a look at that and try to
figure out why they use this in this
sizing look at the solver maybe if it's
not Sol like solver approv maybe they
have a like a exploitive reason for that
uh but yeah that's that's uh those are
the main ways I
improve today I would say yeah when I
found always find it interesting when a
good player does something that you're
like H this is weird and then you look
at the solver and it's also not solver
approved it's interesting to ask
yourself the question like under which
uh assumptions would this play be like
the highest DV and then you can kind of
try to get into his brain like okay so
he assumes that this is actually the
case now then you can double check okay
is this actually going to be the case
you can discuss it with other players
that's indeed when poker becomes the
most interesting I think kind of
obviously the solvers were very good but
if you just look at the solvers it can
also kind of take away the creativity
and the depth of the game but when you
look at player oh why do the best
deviate from solvers and where that's
when the game sort of becomes
interesting again you also mentioned
that a way that you like to improve
right was to play against player good
better players because they kind of
expose your weaknesses right they kind
of do always the things that you don't
want them to do I think that describes
it well right they always put you in a
tough spot they always pick like the
exactly the right sizeing that you
didn't want to face um what was like a a
maybe a recent or one that really stood
out to you a weakness that was exposed
or something that you saw someone do
that made a very big impact on the way
you approach
poker yeah I think uh playing with uh I
played with David Jones uh a while ago
and also enant uh prodj has those both
players have for sure like couple of
times I played against them that they
shown some like exactly like you said
that they
just they just met the sizing you didn't
want to see exactly this but like the
only sizing I don't want to see they
will do it for sure and then I'm my
thumb in my mouth and think about what
did I bet but uh th those you are for
sure
like I've for sure learned from those a
lot like they'll put me in spots where
I'm very out of my comfort zone and like
very in an unknown area in the game
tree so and then I just uh usually I
look at those spots and uh look at the
solver and then try to figure out
that uh maybe this is something I should
look more into because I it was so
uh it it came to me by surprise so much
so usually those buts are really good to
look at because it can expose it that
you know you don't know what to do in
that spot it's a potentially a great uh
place for improvement when uh one of
those spots is exposed to you for
sure you mentioned that one of your
goals you know after you've accumulated
your your financial goals was to try to
become the the best or at least the best
you can be you mentioned now infant pry
David Jones two very very tough players
what do you think sets those guys apart
from you or maybe like obviously lonus
you know the the other the other top
guys what do you think sets those guys
apart from you like what's the Gap and
how and how are you planning on on
closing the Gap yeah I think uh at least
enant I think he has very like
systematic approach to studying and
playing that I don't really have like
I'm way more a freestyler like go with
the flow like I my game plan is kind of
freestyled and I feel like lot of the
very top guys have like more of a like
the structure of their game is way more
I
guess B out and like more systematic
than I have so maybe that's something I
would
uh yeah focus more on uh to maybe build
a more structured way of studying and
structured way of playing too so I think
uh I I guess I have
to good about
I mean I guess the problem with like
kind of freestyling is that you have to
use a lot of energy in spots that other
players don't have to because they they
already have a game plan for the spot
and they just executing the game plan
whereas When You Freestyle you kind of
have to think about spots in game more
that if you are more structured game
plan then you wouldn't have to because
it's already pre kind of pre-planned so
that for sure is something I need to
improve on I think what do you think uh
you mentioned one of the downsides
obviously cost you a lot of energy what
do you think is one of the benefits by
having a less standardized approach to
to spots and the strategy that you want
to
implement I guess like being able to
adapt in game more faster if somebody
shows something new then you can
like
um and you also like big part of my
learning has always been also in game so
if uh if I see something new in game I
I'm more more receptive receptive maybe
to it when I'm kind of
like Freestyle more of a freestyle I
guess and then I guess like maybe
finding like bigger exploits when you're
freestyling you're more aware of every
hand even though uh it cost maybe more
energy but
you're you're more
uh able to look for like exploit spots
when you're like just a kind of fish
styling
whereas if you're more of a structure
then you're just like executing your
plan and not maybe think about thinking
about exploit that much when you have a
very structured game
plan yeah I I can see it both has
benefits and downsides uh I indeed agree
like if you're just like oh this is my
strategy then you kind of stop thinking
and that's a pretty big threat uh I I
feel like the way to look at it is more
you have like a certain General approach
or guideline but you should give
yourself the creative freedom that when
you see a Nuance on the texture or
Nuance based on your opponent or Nuance
based on your specific hand that really
wants to do something else to kind of
give yourself the the creative freedom
to do so I feel like that's probably
where The Sweet Spot lays I remember I
used to play poker with with a guy and
he would have a different preflop
strategy versus everyone that he would
invent and apply now obviously if even
there you have to put a lot of decisions
now he was not a very high volume
grinder he was very good very high wi
but not a very high volume grinder for
obvious obvious reasons
um when making decisions in hands and at
the tables what for you are some of the
most important things you take in
consideration and what do you think is
something players assign way too much
importance towards when making
decisions I think there's a quite a big
difference like playing with the Rex and
fish like if you're playing against Rex
it's kind of fine to just like play
quite normal game and not like focus on
exploits too much against Rex and then I
think that's people do that very well
like they're playing against Rex the
game like normal solid game plan but
then I I think against fish you should
go kind of very
bananas because there's like million
this I like to say that there like five
different shades of Rags but then
there's like hundreds of shades of fish
so there's so many different type of
types of fish that you can tailor your
strategy very well if you're very
receptive and are looking for like the
exploits and also I think you should
take a lot of notes
uh a lot of notes on fish because
there's so many different types and
they're like very specific leaks that
they can have that if you don't uh pay
too much attention you can miss
that so I think that's uh like not
paying enough attention on like fish is
probably probably the biggest thing that
I think most uh most RS probably miss
and there's lot of eeve to gain there I
would say and this kind of the threat
that we just talked about right of like
oh this is my strategy I will execute
this strategy and you kind of mistaking
a new information about ven's range
about what he actually has and like oh
wait but if he has this then I should
probably do that whereas if you think
different like this is my strategy and
you're not wondering like well what the
[ __ ] does this guy actually have you
know your train of thought goes into a
do a different direction I completely
agree versus fish I do the most crazy
[ __ ] uh basically whereas but it also
makes sense if we think about like
energy management from your session as a
whole yeah the bigger the bigger your
opponent deviates from Theory the more
energy you should give this guy because
apparently if you start deviating from
your solid standardized game plan it's
going to give you EV so I guess to give
a little bit of tip to the audience
estimate your table the guy who plays
the best just play your game plan try to
not lose right and the worse your
opponent gets the more the higher return
of investment on your energy if you
think about how to maximally exploit him
yeah I think that's very well put like
that's Excell
the hit the the nail in the head that
was very very well put I I agree with
that yes also actually I've noticed that
I've actually kind of have problems with
myself with that because I like
sometimes played like only Rex for a
while and then I've uh maybe played
played heads up and uh like during heads
up matches I tried to really play a very
solid game
and then I play some uh six match after
that and still in the like play
against a wck mindset that then I missed
the Miss big spots against fish and
actually kind also make pretty big
mistakes when
I kind of assume some things about
certain fish that are very wrong because
I'm in the r kind of R battling mindset
you
know yeah it's it's it's it's really
hard to to suddenly switch your brain
between the two like especially if you
have like two tables of wreck battles
going on then you have a table with the
fish the table with the fish is easily
like ignored and then only like
sometimes I have that like 45 minutes
later wait who is this guy actually that
I'm playing against oh [ __ ] I've already
been playing 45 minutes on this table
and I have no clue how I'm going to
extract the maximum value out of this
recreational here like what happened
okay apparently I need to I need to
refocus um yeah that's I think in
general solid advice what has been the
talking about advice what has been the
best but also the worst advice you
remember receiving about uh about
improving your poker
career H yeah let's see what is the best
I think the best probably
like probably not not to be too results
oriented that's very tough uh in in
poker obviously but
trying to and it's very unnatural to not
think about results but that's for sure
like try trying
to be more and think about the bigger
picture and long term instead of like
the shortterm results that's for sure
like one thing I would advise everybody
to do is to try to think about the big
picture and
uh uh and the long-term career of yours
so not to get not to get too fixated on
the short-term results is for sure a big
thing that uh I think it's always have
helped me and that's uh I think it's
very
important and bad otherwise I don't know
that that's a weird one because I
probably just ignored it I don't know uh
what do you think is bad advice
generally given that you hear in the
poker industry that you don't really
agree with
[Music]
guess
uh I guess uh just
like thinking that like poker is all
about the strategy that uh it's only
about like playing good I think a lot of
uh lot of the things outside of Poker
are super import important for your
performance so like sleep like ignoring
sleep ignoring like health is a I think
that's a big mistakes that are kind of
ignored it it it's like the importance
of those are not magnified I would say
so it's it's only about the I think the
most advice is only about the strategy
when like a lot of
the big improvements you can make is
just like getting the Sleep nutrition
and uh like your mindset also in a very
good B I think that's a big big thing
that it's kind of ignored so it's not
emphasized too much I
think yeah I agree and actually I feel
like this sets higher Stakes players
apart just their ability to execute what
they know to a high level
consistently because nowadays like you
can you can talk strategy with a guy
playing 100 20 you're like hey this guy
know it's [ __ ] but they are like wait
why are you playing 100 or 200l and then
you see his hands actually and his
performance actually in game and it's
like livt factors around it which is
which is basically hindering for him to
put this knowledge into practice or they
sometimes know too much or they
overthink there's a lot of reasons why
players stay stuck at lower and
mid-stakes and very often I agree with
you it's not necessarily technically
related technically related there's a
lot of good information out there and
it's not necessarily anymore what sets
the higher six players apart I would say
would you agree yeah for sure I think
there's also like I some like few years
ago there was a couple of players that I
was playing like at five and zoom that I
thought were really really good then I
was always surprised that why wouldn't
they move up like why are you playing
this game because you're so good that
you could move up but I think that a lot
of those players have the kind
of it's It's about the kind of mindset
around moving up and they are like kind
of like mindset problems regarding to
moving up so it's not at all about
technical game their technical game is
very good but they just have problems
with like other aspects when it comes to
moving up so I think yeah that's
a big big thing that can hinder
your in uh I mean progress in in poker
for sure
like the mindset aspect of uh the game
for sure that's a big uh big thing to
give some concrete things for our
audience because when they are listening
they're like okay I should work on my
mindset okay it's quite fluffy quite
broad you also um mentioned the
importance of not being results oriented
what like some concrete things that
you've implemented that really helped
you for example not be results oriented
or improve your
mindset I think uh like one thing is I
think it's really good that I have
sometimes done but I I think I should do
more it's just like Journal in just
taking notes of like how you feel and
notes of your mood while you're playing
so if you're you
notice notice you have some kind of
negative emotions negative like problems
while you're playing you should take
note of that and like be more self-aware
and more conscious about like about your
mindset and your uh General feelings
while you're playing so for example if
you're prop is moving up so maybe you
take a shot and then like take notes
like how you feel where you're taking a
shot then becoming more aware of what's
how you feel while taking a shot and
then kind
of trying to get to the root cause why
you're feeling these feelings maybe you
get uh maybe it's about financial
insecurity that you just it's too much
money for you then you can uh can
uh Trace where that uh starts from like
maybe it's some something of the
childhood or came from poor family so
taking a big shots can be that's why it
feels so uh get you get so emotional
about that because uh it's
a you have some uh bagage from your
childhood or something like that so just
becoming more aware of these things is
for sure a big thing so I think
journaling can help a lot with that
because you a lot of the emotions and
things you feel are kind of like you you
don't even remember often those after
they have happened so you maybe you take
a shot you feel uncomfortable then you
move on and you forget forget about it
so being more conscious and aware of
uh I guess the negative emotions that
you feel on a daily basis when it comes
to Poker I think that's a big big thing
and I have done a bit and for sure
should do more I think the more aware of
them I think I think the key the key
here is the Curiosity and the way I see
it like if you start to become
reflective of yourself because people
people do you know or at least many
people they do look at their own games
right they try to analyze their own
stats try to look for brief but they
forget to reflect on what's going on
inside of them right and yeah you you
you can get so much information and so
much knowledge about yourself about your
C game B game aame about hey I felt hey
I'm feeling frustrated in this this
situation what triggered it why does it
trigger it these are all information
that you need to gather because they
will show you what you can improve and
to maybe touch on like you mentioned a
good guy playing Five Zoom well maybe he
had an experience moving up burned
himself and he's like now trying to
avoid experiencing those feelings again
and maybe he's not aware of this but
this and he he he he comes up with a
bunch of excuses why you should play 500
I'll Zoom instead right and he believes
them he believes them but but basically
what he's doing is he's avoiding
uncomfortable feelings that arise when
he's moving up and these are like
examples of indeed like things that are
beyond the technical game like the
technical game is only what 30 40% of in
the end what actually makes what makes a
good player um yeah so yeah definitely
think I think a lot of valuable advice
he's kind of more in Adam Street Adam he
uh s mentioned journaling sure I mean
you've probably tried all all all habits
at some point you're a big fan of
journaling
I am I think journaling is a very
effective way to understand your own
thought patterns I feel like journaling
really sticks for some people other
people find it very challenging to go
into I feel like meditation can serve
the same purpose of observing th
patterns under know know your inner
dialogue uh but yeah you cover some
really good topics there in terms of how
to go through the process of improving
your mindset and exactly what you
mentioned like self-awareness is the
Gateway you've got to become aware of
your thoughts how you feel and how you
behave in a very wide range of
situations so when you've got a clear
goal let's say it's moving up Stakes
making more money in poker you've got to
look at how you're thinking feeling and
behaving when you're trying to move
towards that when you're taking actions
that should move you towards it and most
people don't want to do this form of
observation because you've got to look
into yourself look into your own
operating system pull the hood up on the
on the brain look in all the cobwebs and
the baggage that you've collected over
the years all the fears insecurities and
you've got to do some work to recorrect
that but I think if you can go down the
path of going I'm G to observe myself
I'm G to observe how I think and feel in
situations and yeah in general is the
best way to uh get something out of your
mind stop over thinking about it and
just get on paper I like to journal with
questions so I I'll find a feeling and
I'll go why do I feel this way and I
just I'll just freestyle then another
question come why do I think this is
happening and I just keep go why why why
why and each why digs you deeper and
deeper and deeper and finally you get to
a fear you get to an insecurity you get
to a lack of confidence you get to a
icky part where you want to go right I'm
done now close the journal I'm done with
that for today that's you I really
understand that and go right from this
and I'm a quite an action guy so from my
kind of endo when I get somewhere I go
okay with this new knowledge what am I
going to do different what action can I
change going forward that allows me to
step into this and often it's taken a uh
a baby step towards discomfort so let's
say you're a little bit scared of shot
taking because you're you got bad ter of
risk you've noticed that you feel fear
insecurity you got a great win rate when
you're shot taking but every time you
try to shot take you you feel that
feeling and you you move away from it
now your goal is to build a little bit
of a a sample size of going into that
fear remind yourself you got the tools
you're going to be okay you can handle
this adversity and almost like a bit of
exposure therapy to that risk and then
then obser it what happened when I went
into that state oh I freaked out
interesting that's very good and like
you mentioned Rene curiosity like if
you're have a curious mind to how you
respond in situations then you put
yourself in more and more situations
with more curiosity you just build all
this data back going ah I act this way
in that scenario you put me in a
nightclub with my friends I act that way
you trigger me at a pocket table I act
this where and over time you build that
collection of how you're acting as
default and you go right which which of
these do I want to change which of them
do I want to upgrade and yeah you'll see
you'll see like the work begins that's
when uh when mindset work really starts
getting practical when you start to uh
unravel the kind of baggage in your
automated behaviors you start to go
right I want to be a higher performer
how do I start to change some of these
around I think also to to link it back
to what we talked about earlier the
self-criticism if you try to become
self-aware but you're very self-critical
I think that's when there's a that
that's kind of when the problem is it's
indeed like the I I think you you said
ah interesting that that is it right
whereas other one is like oh [ __ ] no I
shouldn't have that you say interesting
that's a completely different reaction
to you having observed like a certain
pattern with yourself so I would say
lose the criticism and Implement more
empathy curiosity interest I think that
just self-awareness is not enough you
you need you need the others as well
because then else you become aware and
only walk around more frustrated and
more angry at your of the things you
just became aware of yeah I like that I
like
that yeah the curios curiosity is a
great way to put it and I think when
you're uh like a in a curious mindset
you are not judging anything you're just
like trying to find out stuff so if
something happens it's not good or bad
it's just like Ah that's what that is so
for sure I think like like Curious
mindset is very very like it's more like
a neutral so you're not judging yourself
too hard
when if you jump in and take a shot and
you just go in with no expectations
whatsoever no fear you're just like
listen I'm gonna take a shot now I'll
see what happens I'm very curious I I
have my pen and paper out I'll write
down how I you right down you go sit and
you just you sit there and observe you
will see that that experience will be
completely different than if you're like
oh [ __ ] we're going to take a shot this
is very
important you know and I I hope this is
going to go well it's completely
different this basically you're setting
yourself up for disaster where if you
just go in like well let's see what
happens
shot yeah you can hear even hear that
the tone of the voice right like oh yeah
it's way more lighter like you're like I
hope I hope crossing your fingers I hope
this is going to go well I mean that's
that's such a bad place to be mindset
was I think also remind yourself it's
never too serious it's all practice
there's never a final exam there's
always a rerun don't let anyone fol you
this is all just a game it's not a
serious thing like if you built this up
to a big thing in your head that I need
to get this shot take I need to make
this money you've blown it out of
proportion so yeah to try to get get a
curious mindset of learning to observe
everything and then also like acceptance
acceptance so some sort of watching what
you what you're sing in your internal
dialogues and accepting that's how
what's unfolding right now knowing that
you can change that later but you got to
accept who you are currently you've got
to like work with your current operating
system you can't run away from it you
can't just crash the system system
reboots and install something new you
got a great this is me right now cool
this is the baggage I've collected all
right some of this really sucks all
right this where I'm at why how do I
move forward from that so yeah I think
all these topics have really intertwined
very very well because the self
critiquing is where this could go astray
if someone observes but also critiques
himself too much that will go off the
other side of the spectrum as we
mentioned before which is probably um
many players listen can do that so yeah
make sure you have compassion and
curiosity this conversation a little bit
it's also actually about like accepting
reality because for example let's say
I'm playing and I make a mistake that I
think I shouldn't be making so there's
already like some conflict between
what's the reality I'm making this
mistake but I I think that I shouldn't
be making it because I think greater of
myself that's also kind of where like
the frustration comes in whereas if you
make a mistake and you're like huh well
apparently I maybe not as good as I
think I am or apparently in the
compromised State I am at this moment
because I've been playing already for
five hours or I have more tables than
normal this is apparently a mistake that
I should expect that can happen right
because if I go in and make a mistake
that I expect that can happen because I
know like oh wait I have five tables I'm
already playing five five hours into my
session some mistakes are likely to
happen and I make the mistake I'm like
likely to happen whereas if I'm just
sitting there I'm like oh I shouldn't be
making a mistake man come on you're
better than this yeah you you see again
with the with the tone it's completely
different yeah also like that if you if
you TR
to you said it well that if you're
trying to kind of ignore reality or
fight reality you're never going to win
like if you if you trying to force
reality be something that it's not you
will never you can never do that that's
impossible task so that's then I guess
the ego comes back right Adam the ego is
back the ego doesn't want the reality to
be the truth that you're you're still
making this mistakes while you know
quote quote that you
shouldn't exactly if you look at most
emotions most emotions come from
resistant reality event happens you
don't like it you don't want to accept
it so you resist it and the emotion is
the the kind of energy you feel as that
resistance and the reason is as you
mentioned that the ego is very fragile
the ego likes to be smart the ego likes
to be correct the ego likes to win so
when the ego gets threatened in the
shortterm rather than you just going oh
I've just lost a partt no big deal the
ego starts go wait a second I can't be
wrong I'm better than this and it starts
to create a narrative that has you
pushing back on reality now you're
fighting with an event that happened
saying I shouldn't have made a mistake
but the event just happened you did so
so news flash wake up here we are um so
I think it's just watching those things
and just playing the game of life with a
less serious tone I think it's really
important to realize like we're all
incomplete humans we're all going
through our own struggles insecurities
and don't make it a big deal that you're
going through these experiences that
anyone listening or even us as as
coaches H we go for experiences and you
just got to watch it observe it and not
get too caught up in it and allow
yourself to accept your insecurities
accept the the things you're working on
that you may not like about yourself
accept reality as R said uh yeah these
are hard things to do but this is the
the game of life and once you tap into
this every day every day is learning
because you're learn about yourself you
learn about life and you're making
progress I hope you guys are enjoying

get back into more goodness in today's
episode so yeah on this topic I want to
actually transition the conversation
into Lessons Learned and I want to know
three lessons you've learned on
different topics so first one is around
poker itself and I want to know one
thing you you've learned about poker now
that you wish you had learned sooner in
your
career yeah I think it's the same thing
that I said about short-term results
that shouldn't be too fixated on the
short-term results like that's and think
about more the bigger picture even like
even in poker and even your life like
how much if you have a down thing like
this is not like in terms of maybe this
week it feels bad but in terms of your
whole life like this down swing you
don't even remember this down swing at
some point so try to think about the
bigger
picture and the longterm and long-term
bigger picture is something I wish I
would wish I would have thought earlier
that it's it's about the the big picture
and not be too fixated on the day-to-day
like shortterm results that's that's one
thing for
sure what is the big lesson or the
biggest lesson that poker has taught you
about yourself as a
person I
think just
being I think it's in general like a
competitive arena is good to
kind of expose your weaknesses so you
can kind
of living in reality when you when
you're in a combet competitive
setting uh and you're worse than your
opponent it kind of you can't really
hide that you can't run away from that
so it kind of teaches you to Face
Reality face reality what is it even
though it can be hard and can be easy to
not want to accept that like we just
talk about but uh I think that's one
thing for sure like being
more being more like accepting aware of
the reality and trying
to make decisions based on based on
reality rather than be delusional about
the your
skills and so on I
think yeah and what has poker taught you
Val lesson about life as a big picture
concept or any idea that's with you that
will stick with you long
term I think like just
like kind of learning how to let go of
trying to control everything because you
can't really control there's a lot of
things you can't you can't really
control uh you can't control how the
session is going today so that's really
good for I think in life in general
because there's also going to happen
stuff in your life that you can't
control even though you want would like
to control it so I guess poker helped
with that game it helped with coming to
that conclusion that uh or realization
that you can't control everything and
kind of let go of trying to control
everything that's uh thing I think and
then be get uh be more peace with that
as
well great lessons stores is a 101 that
H another question I've got for you is
around
what do you believe is the ceiling for
most people so let's say if someone's
already in poker do you feel like anyone
who is committed can make it to high
stakes H it's kind of a very difficult
question because it's kind
of uh what does committ it mean does it
mean that you're willing to sacrifice
everything for poker yes I think then
yes but what does it even mean to
sacrifice everything does it mean that
you're only doing nothing but poker I is
then if somebody is like is is uh not in
school not in job is's only focused in
for poker I guess then a lot of people
can make it but I guess there's also
like some things that are not really
talked about like intelligence is a big
one if you're like more intelligent than
an average person you have for sure a
bigger chance and bigger Edge to make it
in anything so if you
I guess to be more realistic I don't
think everybody can do it but if you're
decently intelligent and you're willing
to make poker your number one priority
then I think a lot of people could make
it uh to at least play high stakes like
uh as a professional I
think I like that answer very thought
out I've got no push back I think it's a
yeah but I I think also that I think
most people people aren't willing
to make that sacrifice and I'm I think
it's it's uh it's not meant for
everybody and as it shouldn't be it's
not like uh if you if you're are not
willing to sacrifice everything about
poker it's not like it's it doesn't mean
it's a bad thing like maybe you just
don't want want to do it you want more
to maybe spend time with friends and
family and that's more uh and other
things are more important that's not uh
that's good too if you if it's good for
you then uh it's great you shouldn't
like Force if you don't want to do it
but I think uh you need to put in a lot
of effort if you want to be good at
poker so and I guess in theory a lot of
people could make it but in practice I
think a lot of people don't even want it
that much I think that's a kind of
a kind of a thing that I actually I
don't know if you know Brandon card he's
like this
uh uh he's like a businessman he he
mainly I think he say like uh training
courses he's like he a really good shape
but he had a video where he talk about
like to if you to know if you want
something instead of asking like what do
you need to do to get something you
should ask instead like what it What
would it take that it would be
impossible you to fail to you to fail
that then it gives a more like a
realistic I think
uh realistic uh view of the situation
because there's a lot of things that uh
people want and want to do like for
example I would uh it would be nice to
know
Spanish but
uh what I have done for learning Spanish
is uh I had a dualingo for one week with
my friend and we did a couple lessons
and that was it so I can I I can uh it
would be nice a lot of things would be
nice it would be nice to learn Spanish
it would be nice to be in a really good
shape for example but am I willing
to do the things that would be that
would make it impossible to me to not be
in good shape no so then you have to be
more like self aware and uh realistic
about what do you actually want so if
you if you look at poker for example
that if you you should ask yourself that
uh am I willing to do a lot of the
things that it would make it impossible
to me not to become a professional then
I think it gets more of a realistic view
what it actually
takes I like that a lot I like it so
much yeah you got to know you got to
want it enough and you got to be willing
to do what it takes for as long as it
takes and then in that willing category
comes at what cost at what cost it one
the trade-offs let's say you want to
have six pack abs it's like all right
great what what are you willing do you
want it how much are you willing to
sacrifice and what's it going to cost in
terms of sacrifices so yeah I think
those things if you can pay them
together then yes lot lot of people have
an opportunity to reach high stakes but
they they they're hard things to get
alignments some players just won't
wanted enough a lot of players people
won't want what they say they want
enough um they'll get to some Milestone
and they'll EAS off the accelerator and
then many if not the majority won't be
willing to do what it takes for as long
as it takes so yeah I like that cavat
that was good wi there was a thorough
answer probably the best answer I've
ever heard to that question so good job
on that one uh next question is a bit of
a different topic um what would you say
is the best investment that you've made
in your poker career either in terms of
money or in terms of
time I think uh like for sure for sure
like some courses have been I think up
swing had a uh couple of courses and I
think in general like coaching is for
sure something like you should invest
more I I never had a coach but I've uh
bought some uh courses from upswing for
example I had this like a long time ago
I think kanu and eduk Koker had
courses so that was uh for sure like
even though it was pretty expensive I
think like a good course or a good co
can like cut so much time off your
learning curve because they can they can
uh show you stuff and they also
especially a coach can like show you
like lot of the big blind spots that you
have that you can by definition can't
see yourself because they're are blind
Poots so that's I think that's that's
one thing too that I guess I would give
an advice that having good people around
you and like good coaches if if you can
find a good coach that's that can be a
very big thing for your for your career
for
sure what do you think is the biggest
obstacle for people who want to uh who
don't want take the pull the trigger and
buy a course or take on a coach why do
you feel players might listen to your
advice but not move towards that I I get
why people don't want to buyers there's
this kind of uh scare they're scared
that because the often can be a lot of
money and then there don't think if it's
worth it but if you can find a good
coach it for sure is worth it it's it's
hard to again we talked about like
long-term short-term uh
thinking so I think in this case twoo
people are very short uh myself included
by the way uh very shortsighted when
they think about buying a coach because
they think that oh it's a investment big
investment 100,000 but if you think
about in long term it it uh in the if
you're ious about improving it's a big
great great great investment in long
term if you have a good coach but then I
guess the problem is that how do you
find a good good coach so that's a
that's I guess the difficult part of
it yeah I think the long-term mindset is
a big factor like if you could really uh
stop and think about the compounding
effects of having a good course or a
good coach to increase your win rate for
the next five 10 years of your career
that you could use yeah to play higher
games with a higher win rate
it would be almost no-brainer to uh to
take take on a coach and find a coach
even if it takes four or five different
attempts but I think most players kind
of want that short that short return on
investment they want to spend X dollar
and get X dollar back um in a very short
period of time and maybe also they don't
maybe believe that they could get the
benefits from a coach maybe the ego
wants to protect them and say I can
learn it myself I don't need help I can
do this All My Own Way how how do you
battle that actually you said you
haven't took on a coach personally but
you've done a lot of courses how do you
battle that kind of the ego's drive to
want to do things itself and to to solve
its own problems have have you battled
that over the years yeah that's a
difficult uh difficult thing for sure
like the I for sure have some ego myself
with that that I I want to do it myself
and kind of uh I don't need I don't need
the coach but it's it's not really
like like if somebody's
uh like it's yeah the ego is a big thing
that you kind of think that you can
do everything by
yourself but uh if you think about it
it's kind of stupid that uh like if if
you take some some skill that you're uh
very very novice at for example let's
say let's say let's take Spanish for for
example I mean in Spanish learning
Spanish you wouldn't uh just like do it
yourself
and like uh not have a teacher to Le
teach you I mean in that case it's very
easy to see that uh a teacher would be a
big help for your improvement but when
it comes to Poker it's kind of like you
think you can do it by yourself and uh
so maybe get perspective on that like
you don't know everything and you don't
need to know everything and if somebody
knows uh somebody knows more than you
it's not a it's not a threat to you if
uh if uh if you ask somebody for
help yeah I agree it's it's difficult uh
battling with your ego sometimes for
sure yeah I think as well it's
acknowledging like maybe you could have
done it yourself maybe you could learn
Spanish by yourself with du lingo apps
and uh figure it out maybe you could
reach high stakes just studying yourself
in your basement but it makes your life
a lot easier it makes the journey Faster
by taking on someone who's walked that
path before who knows the skills if I
want to get good at tennis I could play
tennis every day with my friends or I
could get two hours a week coaching with
a a good coach and my exponential growth
curve of learning is going to be so much
better doesn't mean I couldn't have got
good at tennis just by playing tennis
but there's a there's a better way
there's a more there's a faster path and
the ego doesn't need to be threatened as
long as the ego is okay with getting
better and not having to uh do with the
hard way so to speak it's so funny the
ego sometimes likes the hard path it
likes things that I do myself sometimes
I always I'll take the the hardest path
to to a goal sometimes I'm like it could
have been a lot easier the ego wanted to
be hard just so you could like give
yourself a work stamp at the end of it
um but yeah it's just interesting to
observe that I think some players feel a
lot of resistance obviously all of us
feel less resistance than the average
person based on the choices we've made
in our lives but some people put a lot
of resistance in that area and they
can't move forward even if they might uh
see the benefit so yeah I think it's
good to to discuss that
yeah all right final question from me
this is a bit of a challenging one what
is something that you've had a hard time
accepting you were wrong at over the
course of your career
I think that there was couple of like
Strat strategic things that I had a hard
time letting go I think one thing was
uh like I have this
idea uh in some C bet spot play I would
rather CET like a hand without the back
or flush draw because it would be a easy
easy fault against the check race but
then when when I looked at the solvers
it was the exact opposite so it would
rather see but hand with a backr frustra
than without because it was like uh it
was blocking more continuous so that was
a kind of uh one thing that I had a like
a hard time accepting like the the
solver was kind of like exact opposite
uh suggesting exact opposite thing that
I I came up with myself but then that
was one thing I uh got uh got away from
I think that was for sure one of them
but yeah I think uh yeah I guess I guess
like some of the solver stuff for sure
like because I uh when I I started
playing in 2016 so people there was not
a lot of I think bio I don't remember
when P okay but it wasn't uh widely
used and uh so everybody was kind of
freestyling and doing like figuring out
and uh making their own strategies so I
guess when solvers kind of became more
prevalent I had a little bit tough time
like accepting some of the answers with
the solvers I guess that was uh that was
uh I guess one of the hard harder pills
to swallow that uh my my own thought up
strategies wen't uh like by the solver I
guess that's one thing yeah interesting
time solvers coming out to uh kind of
stress test your ideas and strategies
and some of them you might have got
attached to that you thought were great
players and now you're like wait a
second solver saying this is a this is a
bad play the Sola is wrong or I'm wrong
that's go to fight with the Sola R I'm
guessing for you as well you keep out
your own strategies how did you come to
terms with um things that you maybe uh
were doing incorrectly and how did you
learn to uh yeah move past them without
too much resistance you just nolock the
solver until it does the thing that you
initially thought was
correct I'm sure I'm sure you've done
this as well
yeah and also like if if the solw is
like mixing something like it's mainly a
fold but sometimes call and you call
you're like ah let's see you see it's
sometimes calling so it's fine but if
it's the opposite then then you're like
you're always like biased towards your
own action yeah if something is only 20%
and you want it to be 100% you say ah
20% at least some of the time and when
it's only 20% and you want it to be zero
you say it's only 20% so it's close to
yeah that's that's for sure a thing I
have done I think that's quite common
though to be to be fair to to to give
him a more a more uh a more serious
answer like yes i' like throughout my
career I used a lot of
solvers but I'm actually more in the S
Camp I was always uh uh because I was
already playing high stakes in small
environments when solvers became more
popular and I was playing against guys
who were using solvers a lot and I
learned from playing against other guys
so I was indirectly taking a lot of
solver strategies but I learned it more
to someone did something just like s
explained someone did something I was
like huh that's pretty interesting why
would that be good or when would that be
good and then I would start to implement
this type of stuff and actually that
helped me because then I saw people
would implement the concept and he then
they would have just copied the sofware
and Implement somewhere else but I'm
like yeah but here it makes no sense
because I was trying I didn't just see
the I just saw it and I experienced it
like this is uncomfortable when you do
it in this situation but it's not
uncomfortable when you do it in the
other situation so I kind of by not
really studying the solvers the way
maybe the other guys were I was kind of
protected from the threats I actually
started using solvers way more when I
started to teach because people wanted
to see the solver output so I was like
okay that that'll that'll that'll show
that'll show you what the solware does
now obviously throughout that process
many things that I was doing the solver
agreed with but there were a lot of
things that it didn't agree with and
that's indeed like sort of a hard pill
to swallow then especially in some
situations I say yeah okay but if you
not lock you know this is not actually
so then you get the data and then you
put the data in the solver and then
sometimes that was actually true it was
I Ed an exploitive strategy because the
response of GTO was not was not the way
that the pool was responding so then my
strategy would still be valid but
obviously there were also certain
moments where I was just like
I thought about this completely wrong um
but I I I don't I don't recall having a
lot of resistance necessarily to
something I I in general I never really
had a lot of resistance to other people
saying or thinking different about
something I don't know I I just always
felt like oh well if it's something I'm
doing wrong and you point me out
something better then by all means point
it out because you know it's beneficial
I don't know I never really had
resistance uh in in this area um
s I'm curious what would you describe as
the high point in your
career I think just playing high stakes
was uh super cool for me and then I
think uh one thing was like last year I
won the 5K W coup six Max event that was
uh I think that uh kind of the first
time that uh made me feel that poker is
kind of real if you know what I mean it
always felt like a little bit like I'm
just clicking buttons and numbers on the
screen happened and uh it doesn't really
feel like this is a job or like
profession but when I went the
tournament first of all the it was like
quite a grind and I was I was super
happy how I played the the heads up it
was I think the final table was
like two to three hours and the heads up
was like kind of similar so it was a
very long heads up match and uh kind of
it was like short stack so I'm not uh
super studied in short St heads up so it
was well I I had a lot had to use a lot
of energy to think because it was kind
of a new game for me to play like sh
heads up so and atis in tournaments so I
was super happy how I played that
tournament that heads up especially and
then I got a trophy in the male so that
was kind of cool and made made me feel
like okay now now this poker kind of
seems a real thing you know yeah of a
concrete right like a trophy we don't
have it in cash games
yeah so I guess that's that's the
biggest uh kind
of one of
the greatest moments in my care for sure
because the like you said like the crash
grind is kind of like monotonous every
day slowly improve slowly increase your
Stak slowly increase your wind red so
kind of uh kind of Blends in with every
Stak so there's not a lot of big big
moments I think did you experience any
pressure heads up I mean it's probably
the highest Stakes you've ever played a
heads up match in yeah for sure like I I
think I was so in the zone so I wasn't
really thinking about it but it's
tournaments are so stupid because you
kind of at some point you're playing
like your highest stes random highest
highest stes heads up you then go for
like infinite money infinitely bigger
money than you normally play so
tournaments are stupid uh stupid like
that but I think in the moment didn't
really feel I was so focused just like
playing my best and kind of just hit
after I I want it after after the heads
up it was quite intense so I was so
focused on just playing so during the
heads up I I wasn't really feeling much
pressure I
think what are you uh currently working
on when it comes down to poker strategy
what are you excited for so let's say I
I'll message you tomorrow and say SE
let's uh let's do a coach let's do
strategy call what what what are we
going to
discuss I think I uh like recent couple
of years I started to play quite aot lot
of more heads up and I've uh started to
enjoy it a lot I've uh battled quite a
lot with a couple of guys sometimes uh
maybe against people I probably
shouldn't play uh but it's been a
learning experience I think U like heads
up is super uh interested in heads up
right now like learning uh playing heads
up and learning heads up I think that's
uh I've studied quite a bit heads up at
the moment what is it uh that heads up
gives you that six Max
laxs I think uh I think my favorite uh
format is actually three max so three
max three max against bre that's threx
is the nicest yes yes I agree with you
this one like that's that's my favorite
like format but you can't really play it
that often because either people join or
fish join so you can't really play freax
very often these fish these fish always
get in the way
annoying or the some or some Rex you
know join so you I would like to play
3ax a lot but uh you often don't get to
play it that much but heads up is nice
because you're always like it's always
heads up at least if you're playing like
heads up Zoom or heads up
tables and I guess that's uh like very
competitive uh very competitive uh
format because you play a lot a lot of
hand against Rex so it's uh I think the
that's I I think the competitive aspect
is uh what drives
me today a lot and that's why uh I like
to play heads up more today than I used
to how do you uh see the future of Poker
and how do you see yourself in
it I actually like I see a lot of people
being
quite pessimistic maybe about poker but
I tend to disagree a bit I
think poker is doing quite well
considering like a lot of the
regulations and stuff I think for
example the reason why Stars has kind of
gone down is because like they they have
toen quite a lot of
hits from like a regulated side like
there's lot a lot of countries can play
there the deposit limits are lowered a
lot so I think the problem with like
liquidity in a lot of sites it's not
because people don't want to play it's
because
people like there's barriers to playing
that uh didn't used to be there so I
think and you can see this a lot of Liv
stops for example like L the numbers are
growing like a lot of livestock so
people are willing to play people want
to play poker but it's not uh as long as
that side is good I think poker has a
pretty good future as long as people
want to play are excited to play and the
game is exciting I think poker has a
pretty good future so I think the
problem now is a lot of the regulations
and stuff are like the biggest obstacle
for poker right now and what what comes
to bots like I guess that's also a bit
of uh BS and like RTA is has uh been a
discussion point but I don't think I I
think a lot of the sites are B strict at
least uh the SES I play on for example I
actually got
the I got um on start as I get email
that I uh my account was freezed and I
need to need to record myself playing
that's a compliment H that's a
compliment yeah I I I think that's play
too
well so at least it's it's good to know
that they're taking pretty seriously so
at least us I don't know other sides
there's like I ACR and ignition I don't
play on them but I've heard
there's quite loser probably
the guess security side but uh not sure
about that and yeah but yeah I'm pretty
optimistic I would say about the future
of
Poker what would you like the main
takeaway for audience to be from our
conversation uh I think it's just
uh enjoy
life enjoy life uh not uh try not to
take life too seriously and uh not not
uh try not to take poker too seriously
and just enjoy the moment and enjoy the
fact that you can even play poker for a
living or if you're aspiring to play at
least you have chance to try to go to
GoPro and uh enjoy the ride I think
that's a yeah it's for sure right so I
mean you hopped on you might as well
enjoy it right yeah or find a way to
enjoy it Adam any final questions for S
before we let him
go no I thank you for your time it's
been an amazing conversation I think
that ended it very well try to be happy
on the journey whatever you trying to
achieve and yeah we appreciate you spend
the last three hours with
us thanks a lot uh this was a enjoyable
conversation and uh yeah thank
you great conversation with SE Adam what
are your main takeaways from our
pod yeah we went very deep on some very
important topics which I don't think
we've discussed before on previous
podcasts that was very exciting and
interesting one of them was about your
inner critical voice that self-critique
that we all have and when that's pushed
too far we had a good debate on when
self-criticism is a good thing when it's
a bad thing and when you push it to its
extremes and yeah I think a lot of
people can learn the lesson as you
mentioned reney as well of being more
compassionate towards yourself and using
self-criticism as yes it can drive you
to take action to improve yourself but
also it can just lead you to self bash
yourself and to not make progress so you
got to find a way to be kind of yourself
to learn from mistakes and to not yeah
overly dial that up and if it is too
high to to dial down that that
self-criticism next one is like
self-awareness and we went quite deep
into this as well how to work on your
mindset by observing your thoughts your
feelings and behaviors and then again
not critiquing not judging too much but
like unraveling um all your patterns of
thinking and then finding ways to to
move past them which I thought was a
very interesting conversation then we
talked about results focusing on results
and not focused on results one of his
biggest lessons he's learned in his life
and he has a very easy rule of checking
only Bion so he's shot take at higher
Stakes he doesn't judge himself doesn't
put too much weight that he's lost 10K
Buy in rather than a 1K Buy in and just
tries to uh remind himself the long term
that what he's trying to do achieve
success the long term be his best vision
of himself and yeah not getting too uh
attached to the shortterm metrics EAS
said than done I know a lot of people
listening be like yeah I wish I didn't
have a care about results but it's a big
part of how I think so a lot of work for
players to do there to to distract that
and then we talk a lot about curiosity
and always being curious always trying
to learn I class him as a bit of a
sponge in terms of always absorbing
Knowledge from players around him
reminds me of a concept from Zen
Buddhism which is called beginners mind
and it's about always going in there
with open curious minds always even if
you're advanced level going as a
beginner try to learn things try to uh
be the person who's absorbing
information don't take things too
seriously and then it's final part of
words were have fun enjoy the journey so
yeah very very rounded conversation we
covered some big topics which I very
much enjoyed how about yourself Ren what
some of the main things you take from
that yeah the Curiosity was a good one
and in general like gathering
information right he mentioned that the
technical side is only such a small side
of what makes a good poker player right
he mentioned like oh there can be a
great wck grinding at 500L but why
doesn't he why doesn't he move up well
probably you know he's he's avoiding
certain feelings that are associated
with moving up and you know he's finding
different excuses of why he maybe
wouldn't be able to move up uh we also
talked about expectations how
expectations set you up for frustration
right so very important to align those
expectations technically we talked about
I think he he if I I quote him correctly
he said five shades of rags and 100
shades of fish uh we talked a little bit
about adjusting and putting like energy
into playing versus recreationals we
also talked a little bit about the
benefits of freestyling a bit more and
making like actively thinking in game
and making decisions versus having like
a more standardized game plan um
basically the further your opponent
deviate from Theory the higher your
return of investment of energy so a
recreational for example who deviates
very a lot from Theory who can we win a
lot of money from if we give it uh our
attention that's probably then where our
focus should be or where at least our
return of investment is the highest um
we talked about strategy in terms of
improving he was a very big fan of
observing better players and playing
against better players because if you
play against better players their
strategies they kind of review your
weaknesses so they will exactly do the
thing that you don't want them to do uh
and you can learn a lot from that I also
definitely share that experience he also
reels a lot of games and I think he
mentioned that sometimes if you see if
he sees good players do something
different than Theory would suggest uh
it's interesting to try to figure out
okay under which assumptions would his
play actually be better than what the
solver would do and are these what can I
learn from these assumptions like
basically you're trying to learn reads
that other players have by looking at
deviations good players have in their
strategy from GTO all right um yeah I
think I think those were kind of the
main takeaways that I wrote down I hope
