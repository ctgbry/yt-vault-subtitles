some online poker
today
on the waco show you guys know what uh

[01:32]
on the waco show you guys know what uh
what we're dealing with here
let's make a little flat call
start with a little flat cop
with the pocket 6s

[01:46]
there's one target see that easy cop
would have some races on this board
that's not gonna include pocket sixes
i wouldn't mind raising like fives with
a spade or something

[02:02]
you choose a half pop barrel size which
i really like i think this is
the perfect sizing to use
and in general we're in quite a tough
spot here
and
yeah i think this is literally he picked

[02:16]
yeah i think this is literally he picked
like the perfect bad sizing in my
opinion
shout out to mr cervox for putting me in
a tough spot there i'll go for a little
flacco here with the pocket h
it's a hand that uh
to be honest can kinda go either way

[02:33]
let me see if i can
share some points
the first one is uh
about decision making
okay basically your decision making
process and i think you've heard me say

[02:45]
process and i think you've heard me say
this before right that i think a lot of
the mistakes that i make is not
necessarily
a lack of knowledge
but more
a wrong wrong train of thought so i'm
thinking about something in the wrong

[03:01]
thinking about something in the wrong
order
of importance i'm
valuing certain things highly while i
shouldn't because of the situation
so there's a couple of things in my
decision making process that i think
of game

[03:16]
of game
you know i come to the logical
conclusion but in game
i somehow don't
probably face a little delayed see that
here
i think i'm gonna call this one even
though it's quite close
i think it's okay still

[03:33]
i think having a club is just very good
set outs are okay
but i think a club
club is just very important like i would

[03:45]
club is just very important like i would
much rather call this i think than like
10 9 suited or something or east 10.
he checks the river and i think now we
have easy check i hope to win versus
like a one and done ace five or
something

[04:01]
something
is nine
make a little bet here with the a7
actually it's not that little

[04:23]
that's what they call an excellent turn

[04:31]
actually not 100 sure what the correct
place
oh this is literally what i was just
talking about

[04:47]
good hand get money in the goddamn pot
and then again i do something funky
yeah

[05:00]
yeah
i'm not really in line with what we were
talking about right
it's interesting
and this is good right that you put
these focus points not only

[05:16]
these focus points not only
to
but like for example i i realized this
now i saw this happening because i said
the intention because of my
i gave my brain
the order to scan for situations where i
might do that now you know the question

[05:30]
might do that now you know the question
is if here
it was a good idea yes or no
and i do think the ace is quite a good
card for him he should be calling ace
jack ace queen
uh maybe even like ace nine suited with

[05:46]
uh maybe even like ace nine suited with
backers on the flop
and the aces that i do over bet on the
flop i think in these positions are
gonna be more like ace racks i'm gonna
have a lot of over pairs
i think also you should probably do some
leading
but i don't think that really happens

[06:01]
but i don't think that really happens
so therefore you have a lot of strong
hands when he checks they're making me
also have to check quite often
and basically if you have an ace and a
10 and there's days in the tennis the
top two cards
then it's very unlikely that your
opponent has a hand that he can pay you

[06:15]
opponent has a hand that he can pay you
off with but then sometimes slow playing
right as they say
is an okay
option

[06:32]
you could also actually have a low
frequency donkey on the right
right top but jack queen i don't think
is a hand that i'm gonna do that with

[06:46]
default

[07:01]
okay you got my pocket is quite a light
call i would say
i actually like bluffing ace jack there
i prefer bluffing ace jack than
like an ace five or something
here we face a bat bats

[07:34]
i think actually i'm gonna make a little
a little bit of an exploit default
and then actually i'll go back to the
chat i have not talked to the chat yet
how was your weekend wacko
my weekend was fine i was actually in

[07:46]
my weekend was fine i was actually in
spain for five days visiting uh family
you have it do you have spanish blood
veko can't you see that man look look
how tanned i am
well no

[08:01]
i don't have any spanish pop
but my parents will have a house in
spain
and once a year we usually meet up there
family sister
my nieces

[08:18]
and then we are there to have a good
time
good good time

[08:32]
also i think when analyzing your games
something that's also quite good is that
you also see which part of your game are
actually doing well
sometimes when
things are not really going your way
people tend to just start doubting
everything

[08:46]
everything
whereas if
you pay more attention
or no that's not the right word whereas
if you
kind of know where it's going wrong
it helps you remain confidence in the

[09:00]
it helps you remain confidence in the
spots that you are playing well right so
i know exactly
which areas of my game i
where my leaks were occurring basically
hey pokemons what do you think about

[09:15]
hey pokemons what do you think about
poker regulation netherlands does it
affect you not really
but it's good right that it gets
regulated
interesting wear

[09:30]
do we bluff this do we bluff this
whiplash

[10:01]
i like his bed

[10:24]
a lot of games actually are closing

[10:40]
so

[10:52]
i think that what's left is here

[11:08]
good luck my friend thank you very much

[11:19]
face a barrel here

[11:39]
i'm not that sharp today i've noticed
already so far
in terms of the brain it's not really

[11:46]
in terms of the brain it's not really
working but luckily you know it just
flop flushes so you don't really have
much to think about usually
this is better flush
are you [ __ ] serious
can i even play in this game i mean what

[12:00]
can i even play in this game i mean what
the [ __ ] they find oh i mean what the
i mean how can i even play in this game
it's like i just get cheated i mean hand
after hand after hand
this is actually something to be care to
be a bit careful about if you're in a

[12:15]
be a bit careful about if you're in a
downswing you can now
use a hand like this and see yeah you
see i'm in the downswing blah blah blah
and then start to get very negative
which is a very bad idea guys because
then you get into the negative spiral of
the downswing
okay so don't do that do you need help

[12:30]
okay so don't do that do you need help
explaining what the hell goes on in
these videos well then poker ambition is
the place to go to reoffer various
servers for various levels of players go

did adam suggest an alternative

[12:45]
did adam suggest an alternative
nootropic
since you can't have green tea and
chocolate anymore i can still have
chocolate i don't do any more green tea
little caffeine detox
which i think is almost over and then
i'll slowly reintroduce caffeine
when i play

[13:00]
when i play
because then it will definitely have a
good cognitive boost
and then i will basically not take
caffeine
any other time so your body doesn't get
used to it so it really has a good
cognitive boost every time you play

[13:16]
i also switch to lion's mane
coffee
is based on mushrooms
as
definitely less caffeine as well
but yeah i was talking about the
giveaway right
thursday yes this thursday i'll be

[13:31]
thursday yes this thursday i'll be
