[00:00]
I don't know if victim that is the right
word. Like when online players go play
live, they're almost kind of sitting
there voluntarily torturing themselves
saying, "Oh, this is so boring." It's
kind of what you said. They didn't
really align expectation. Well, what did
you expect? You usually play [ __ ]

[00:15]
you expect? You usually play [ __ ]
300s an hour and now you're going to
play 20. What did you expect? Right. But
then it feels like that's kind of the
vibe that I got. Everyone just sits
there. It's like, "Oh, life poker is so
boring." Yeah. Well, we're sitting here.
Why are we Why are we reconfirming that
life poker is so boring? It's almost
like we're sitting there that we like to

[00:31]
like we're sitting there that we like to
sort of torture oursel in a weird way.
You understand what I mean? Is it is it
like a sort of I don't know
self-sabotage or victim mentality?
&gt;&gt; Probably could be that way. So like
nobody nobody forced you to be here. So
if you don't want to be here, don't be
here. But it's like you know uh it's

[00:46]
here. But it's like you know uh it's
also like attachment to your ideas which
was going back again to the start. So
like
we still like there is like a positive
psychology. So if you like the optimist
living longer than pessimist, which is
the same for like if you're framing your

[01:01]
the same for like if you're framing your
mind that life poker is [ __ ] boring,
it's going to become boring. And when
you're going to be bored, you're going
to how you going to address it and
you're going to address it with a phone
with run away from from the boredom. But
you're still thinking about negative

[01:15]
you're still thinking about negative
ideas. So it's going to broad the ideas
about
let's say negative emotions. So you're
going to feel like slightly frustrating.
So you're already more frustrating cuz
you're thinking that something's boring
and you need to be in boring environment
and you just don't like it which you

[01:31]
and you just don't like it which you
already like we can do like small
experiment if you just close the eyes
and imagining like something very boring
and you want to be there or like how do
you feel?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then and then you're almost
self-sabotaging yourself to leave.

[01:45]
self-sabotaging yourself to leave.
You're going to punt away so that you
can leave. It's almost like
self-sabotaging me mechanism. But it's
interesting that you said because like
the perspective if you sit there with
the idea of oh life poker is so
interesting and if you keep on repeating
that you start to see reasons why life

[02:00]
that you start to see reasons why life
poker can indeed be very interesting
just like you said whereas if you so
again comes back to becoming conscious
of this thought or this loop that you
have in your head that they're sitting
there and understanding the consequences
that this has and changing that
perspective.

[02:15]
perspective.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. uh all these perspectives could be
like very
I would say refreshing if you can if you
can reframe it but we going back back to
the start are you able to be aware of
your own thoughts or like what's

[02:31]
your own thoughts or like what's
happening or like the impact of the
thought because like you clearly
describe it but you can see that you
already work on it so like just just
thinking about how reframing the
thoughts and what thoughts could cause
and we going back again if it's first

[02:45]
and we going back again if it's first
egg or the chicken, you know, like
&gt;&gt; you mentioned uh I like that ideas to
let go of. What do you think are some
ideas that online players who go play
live should let go of?
&gt;&gt; They are smartest guys in the room. They
they probably are or still could be but

[03:02]
they probably are or still could be but
uh yeah and they need to like prove it
to others you know because like there is
like a social aspect and they are not
aware of it but there is like a judge
you know like a uh you going before
before trial and there's like 12 people

[03:16]
before trial and there's like 12 people
nine people going to judging you and now
it's like you're going to look dumb or
you need to prove yourself and
there there is small tension so I
believe deep there it's very frequently

[03:30]
believe deep there it's very frequently
like I need I need to prove others I'm
smart there there is like very
unconscious way of like proving it and
you prove it like bunch of FPS which is
like very frequent I would say very
guilty of

[03:46]
guilty of
&gt;&gt; it's really funny that the more you
mention this the more I think it all
comes down with comes down it's all a
consequence of the mentality which with
they sit down like you already said kind
of the pessimist kind of the oh I'm
online live players suck and therefore

[04:00]
online live players suck and therefore
they kind of get entitled therefore they
get more easily frustrated therefore
they're not curious right they're
already assuming like oh I'm online I
have skills but I also feel like where
your EV actually comes from in a live
game and how you gain it's very
different skills for example online yes

[04:15]
different skills for example online yes
you know you're very skilled at single
race spots in position versus big blind
you know exactly what to do that's where
your EV comes from in online poker
environment right be very accurate in
all the frequent spots but I feel like
your EV V comes from something way
different in life. Correct.

[04:31]
different in life. Correct.
&gt;&gt; Probably. Uh and just be even like
willing to admit it or just like I like
the phrase of the curiosity which you
which you use like being just curious is
like like amazing but also like maybe
like where is the Eevee in live games?
It's maybe like I don't know now build a

[04:47]
It's maybe like I don't know now build a
connection and getting to bigger games
could be one second of one could be
actually notice that somebody's tilted
could be like another one or like
just even like having empathy and see
what other people like seeking on the

[05:01]
what other people like seeking on the
table. It's like everybody's seeking
something. So let's say there's guys
&gt;&gt; why are they here?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. There just let's say they run away
from families. So they need to prove
something. If you understand like the
guy who's coming there every day just
proving whatever his worth

[05:17]
proving whatever his worth
in life or just this is this is his job
and he's talking about it and he's uh
let's say very important CEO. So he's
way rather lose money than than feel
dumb. So how much is going to affect his

[05:32]
dumb. So how much is going to affect his
place? Let's say he's like he's clearly
doesn't want to want to be dumb. So So
what does it mean? He's probably going
to call more because like call and lose
is fine but having having unsolved
questions. That's could be that's could

[05:46]
questions. That's could be that's could
be very rough for him because like going
home with uncertainty we're going back
like boredom uncertaintity that's going
to like kill the people. So people going
to do it way way more often or uh
is the value.

[06:01]
is the value.
It's clear for different for some games,
but if it's like if people's drinking
maybe like monetizing the their puns,
it's like significantly bigger or like
let's say there is stand-up game is like
maybe you're playing 10 times higher
stake in the standup game. How how is
like possible that you are not focused

[06:15]
like possible that you are not focused
for the standup game? You can just you
can be on the phone afterwards. There's
like Yeah, there could be these layers.
