hello
my twitch friends what's up what's up
what's up we're gonna do another little
high stakes review and
the reason for that is we've got
the biggest compliment of pokerstars you
can imagine
as they put in my account under
investigation for possible botules
okay so we were that gto that they
decided to check hey
let's let's check out what's going on
with this account so big compliment
that's how hard we crush them today
yeah putting on stream yeah i i i even
sent them a link to the stream but to
the youtube sales
i look quite human while playing don't
you agree
it's just you know they said they said
your frequencies seem quite gto sir
do you use any sort of assisting
software while playing
so yeah i had to inform them no let me
talk to them you make plenty of
mistakes yeah i i even said that in the
email i said
if your data shows what the i said like
if your data shows something
if you've seen a leak please don't do it
for me up until then guys
we got a little game on our hands with
mr justin mr pike mike boyfriend again
on linus
two usual suspects we also reviewed them
in the last eyesight reel
and we got dutch sensation
the one and only poker kluka in the
house
all right let's just let's just get an
accent they're playing two tables
okay so it's a bit easier than last time
line is meant for the check race so
white line is three bats making
boyfriend called
is a hand that you could consider for
betting any sizing
jam small whatever and linus i think
just goes for the check race get in
i'm not mistaken so he blocks ace and
suit
he just goes straight away for the jam
okay not a small check race but straight
away for the gem
he has ace king with the king of spades
guys what do we think of this action
what do we think of the czech gem we
already have the spoiler
the king of spades versus the nuts so
obviously ponto no pun gto
shout out to mr easy with aces
hunter no punt equity denial play yeah i
mean it's for sure in equity denial play
you're denying equity from king jack
king queen
um and obviously the benefit always with
these kind of holdings is
uh that you get called by words right he
will call you with ace five of spades
for example
um and you have extra equity just in
case he has and like 10 jack suited
um so i don't i don't hate this play
check gems are definitely
a thing on this board so
i mean i don't mind it blocks best tents
yeah it indeed blocks best tents but
yes it blocks best stance bully play i
remember doesn't offer a cfp dues couple
of years
ago he still has actually no he still i
think
i think he still has the cf deal
together with what's his name
scorpio so yeah first uh first stack
goes to mikey boyfriend guys
we face a quarter c bat which is quite
standard ish um
but shouldn't be overdone actually if
three better from the big blind
but then again we're talking uh
theory here in practice
i think it's a fine play and get a call
which mica boyfin should do very often
and the a turn here is interesting i
think it
is a reasonable blank eight seven suited
can be in both players ranges eight nine
suited can be at both players ranges
eight tenths suited more likely in just
sims range than a micro boyfin
so i think the eight is a reasonable
blank
i would expect uh it depends kind of on
your
opponent but i think here i would prefer
a more polarized approach but you can
definitely also find a couple of blocks
but
first the cutoff i personally
prefer to either start betting flop
even smaller like the 10 that we talked
about but after a quarter
i don't mind just checking and
reevaluating the situation
and when i say reevaluating the
situation is how [ __ ] crazy is my
opponent
aka how aggressive is he and then the
more aggressive he is the more i will
call the more passive he is the more i
will fall
check check and now if i'm jason i will
do quite a lot of small betting mixing
actually also with some very big bets i
don't mind it but
it's a very small part of your strategy
i think a lot of my hands that actually
want to be big might want to check
or bet small so i think just checking or
bending small is a fine strategy
just subscribed thank you very much
subscribe for four months hashtag
loyalty
and he's even on a three-month streak
shout out to mr kaku guys he goes again
for the check i would assume now this is
something that has
uh shown on value but maybe was a bit
too thin to bet
but i cannot really think of too many
hands
or maybe just as a give up like king
queen of clubs or something
ninth i would yeah
ninth is an option or king queen of
clubs we're just gonna read him quite uh
quite accurately here
yes ace king so
this is to what i said earlier why i
don't want to have too much big bats
i i get the check it makes a lot of
sense
why why do you what would be the benefit
of checking
over betting the main benefit there is i
think one main benefit here
do you think a strong bench press helps
or determine tool to avoid
chicken dance plays you don't get raised
uh no you're completely in the wrong
direction i would say
because if you if you go for a matching
bed line here
or a small sizing
you want to get raised if you don't get
race you should never bat your bed with
a small sizing
yeah he's check raising all the way
that's that's the point so
it's a turn on which micro boyfriend is
going to check by quite some aces
ace acts
and basically what happens on the river
is if we track and he bets he's going to
bet every asex and then we can race
whereas if we bet ourselves and ace x
is usually not raising unless we bet
very small and that's why i said there's
no real reason to be
big when was the session played
and where is it possible to watch
session was played
a week ago one half week ago two weeks
ago
and you can re-watch it at high stakes
poker stream
it's an it's an interesting hand um
i think he thinks that michael boffin
would be quite aggressive on the turn
i preferably would just bet this hand on
the turn i think
but the more aggressive your opponent is
i think i think it's played fine
and here we get a small c bet from
glucose spot where justin is going to do
quite some check raising
he doesn't he's just calls here we also
get a call mike and boyfriend is gonna
respond again
by slowing down in terms of his bad
sizing here so we'll see the same
concept come back three times
so for example if you don't understand
why this is happening there's a clear
thing that
you will see a lot of players do
so a big opportunity for winrate game
right always when you watch
other players play you want to look for
things that they constantly do
that you're not doing and just assuming
you know giving these guys some credit
that they know something that you don't
check call check check turn not really a
turn i think luca is gonna do a lot of
pot controlling so i would say clue guy
is quite weak and jason's still unkept
so i would
expect jason to do some firing
up to what stakes do you think i could
get away with being overly aggressive so
far
anatoly zoom has been working
you can get away with it i think up
until 1k
i've seen this quite often that people
uh are just
aggressive for the sake of being
aggressive and that works up until you
reach 1k and then
there's a lot of players who really have
to re recalibrate their aggression right
but definitely i would say over
aggression
versus um so and this is also a problem
usually people are over aggressive they
kind of have the mindset of fighting for
pots
you should be over aggressive in the
right spots right if you think you can
get away with being very aggressive
versus population because you know they
just give up too often
then don't go and [ __ ] re-raise them
when
when when they're finally showing that
they're interested in the hand
now you're just spewing away money
uh overly attacking cap ranges yeah in
general estimate if your opponent is
weak
and yeah if you think yes and apply
enough pressure hey
it's probably gonna work at any at any
level that is
but in general obviously the the thing
is
when you say like over aggression
like what's gonna happen when you move
up stakes you're gonna new ones
okay what a good spot to be over
aggressive what a good spot to be overly
passive you cannot just say
is over aggressive being over aggressive
is that a good strategy
there's way too much nuances involved i
have 30
flop rates receive it when gto is 5
okay i i would say in general
that's an okay strategy on the flush
completing
turn is the strategy different in
position yes the strategy
is slightly different in position but
you will see the same trend because the
trend
so there's some main concepts for
imposition play out of position play
and there's main concepts on
how strategies change when boards become
wet or connected or disconnected and dry
okay there's main strategic differences
that you have to start
understanding which apply in all spots
but in this case in position and out
position there's a big difference
in terms of bad sizing use you will see
that imposition is more likely to check
whereas outposition is more likely to
bet small
no you won't get cracked like
at certain points you're going to start
to add nuances to your strategy
so justin here goes for a big bet which
i really like
and i think he can do it a very big part
of his range and i think poker kluka
the nature of the spot sort of is that
he's just yeah
in he basically always has a bluff
catcher
uh or or he has something that he has to
fold that's kind of the nature of the
spot
actually the nature of the spot guys is
is something that i wrote down to add
as a topic in the mechanics there's a
philosophy section i'm gonna add their
understanding
oh it's my title again understanding
and flowing with the nature of the spot
very important concept
understanding nature of spots and how
they play
and what happens if you don't play by
the rules of the nature of the spot
i might have seen some top players huts
with that number yeah for sure i mean
there's a lot of
let me take stefan for example very
aggressive guy
and you also see phase i remember linus
for example at a phase where he was very
aggressive and then suddenly switched to
a strategy where he was very passive
or at least passive on earlier street
i'm pretty sure gto raised more severe
than any regular
i would actually also say that that's a
gto gto is very aggressive
so we gotta check through and check
river say most likely holding now of
mikey boyfin
is like a 10 jack suited or something
an ace 10 suited
maybe an 8.
but i'll put up with the majority of
majority of my money i will put on a 10x
suited type of hand
lucas in a tank he checks so they both
actually indeed had a suited
10 which i think is very likely luke i
guess was considering if he should be
bluffing his hand but then estimated
that
his shoulder value is a little bit too
high this is actually something that
some players will then also guess wrong
they will just be like yeah well if i
bet he's gonna fold a better hand
that's that's that is part of the
equation yes
but not everything do you want to have a
better understanding of what's going on
in these videos
in our mechanics and poker program we
focus on when and why certain strategy
generates highest ev
and how to perform more consistently at
the poker tables
so you can get a deeper understanding of
how poker really works
and how to get more success in poker so
do you want over 30k dollar worth of
value
go over to the site and join our
mechanics of poker program here we see a
bigger size and we saw mac and boyfriend
use a three-quarter sizing quite
often um it's quite common on these type
of textures that you will start to use
some bigger sizings
the texture is way different than uh
than the a66
rainbow for example get a call
interesting term
expect a big bet from mikey boyfriend
pot
that's that's that's typical something
from mike and boyfriend
but i would say bigger but i've seen him
do a lot of falling so that's why i went
for it
he checks would say it's not necessarily
straightaway the fact that he is weak
if luka checks again
um yeah in general the
the nature is that he's gonna have some
weak shot on value or a trap
that he's looking to check raise the
river with microphone
does go for the bat main type of value
hand here
um i don't know if it goes as thin as a
hand like king 10
suited but a jack could definitely be
an okay hand and then we're probably
looking at a hand like ace jack king
jack
i don't know if he bats jack five suited
this size on the flop in terms of bluff
something like ace do suited or
something is an option
is a space i think that's that's these
type of holdings that's something that
we have to look out for king 5
suited
definitely also some some suited hands
like for example a king seven of
diamonds let's see what poker does
it's a spot where michael boyfin is
capped
so let me see if we're playing versus mr
lavrov too he would now put his stack
then out of this i don't know if he
would put a 9.5 k in this spot
so the 5.5 k is indeed released by poker
clue
main value hand that this makes a lot of
sense with this and like jack 10
it's the first hand that would come into
my mind that would always
prefer check raising
he has a straight and he got called
quite fast
i think a straight doesn't mind
betting small on the river instead of
checking
but
he did back quite big on the flop so
okay could have estimated his reign to
be a little bit more polarized
and then betting then doing checking
then checking makes a little bit more
sense shout out to click up click it's
been watching the stream
stealing my strategies over a little ten
percent
yeah so the two x basically two two when
there's two two on the board
and that's for in that spot let's say
for example
mr uh
ellen garner i'll make it ellen garner
if you limp from the small blind like
we saw linus do for example and the big
blind checks and then there's two two
three
which is also a pair board you will
probably just check range
whereas if we made a three bet and the
flop comes 10 10 deuce
basically the deuce is a blank it's a
very dry board it has no connectivity
with the imposition calling race to the
three bet
whereas it has very high connectibility
with the big blind checkback range who
has deuce 8 offsuit
so it's not necessarily the board is dry
or the board is paired
that drives the strategy it's the range
interaction that drives the strategy
hard for opponent to defend enough of
their range
yeah basically uh linus has to overfall
he follows it up with not a
bet which i like as well
actually i wouldn't mind going even
smaller
small bats small bats called coal
and he goes for the triple small bed in
your face
which i definitely like i think this is
a very good line taken
okay bike luca and if you want to
understand
the ev behind the strategy that is using
because this is a very common
type of strategy and if you also want to
understand the call of lightness
i made a little three bedpods out of
position masterclass as we saw earlier
and i'm currently working on the small
blind versus big man massacre
so wait so he showed up with the 10 jack
which is a very good bluffing candidate
as it blocks istan is jack king 10
king jack even though you could make an
argument that after 10
and after 20 on the turn while my camera
becomes a little bit blurry
that he doesn't really have those
anymore so you could actually make an
argument that this is not a great
bluffing hand
a line is called with fives which i
think is a very good love catching
candidate
especially if luca does decide to blot a
hand like this
his reasoning is he wants to bap more
asex so he has to go smaller for three
streets
that is part of the strategy yes [ __ ] i
know again i miss what happened in this
hand why do i keep on missing
what's going on here this is a
ah he opened 245 okay check
pod turn that makes sense five of hearts
is relevant yeah it's relevant as in
not a great card but this also depends
how much suited connectors you think uh
glue guy is betting the tournament so
coal
interesting river
yeah you would rather call five snow
hard on the turn
uh we got a snap call from zasam
and i think a bat from michael boyfriend
what king queen right so he popped
king queen yes it makes sense and then
pots the river
three quarters what does he do block
no pot right i think that's way too much
of a block
again we see a similar concept where
they go for these
tiny little bets okay i mean anyways
once he checks
the other hand something or not i would
just jam and if he has a 10 he'll call
if not
he'll fault it's as easy as that i would
just jam here
i think he is this you're damn [ __ ]
god damn it why do you do this [ __ ] all
the time
all the [ __ ] time i teach you
don't do those gay bets why do you have
to do it
why i don't get it why
i love this clip but yeah yeah i agree
here it's definitely this is definitely
more of an induction sizing
i i completely agree with you we will
play that one next time
so that's also a reason why justin just
snaps maybe he
also had a king like king nine of clubs
or something
okay get it all in here from linus so i
expect the a stand suited
or some type of draw actually not
not a strange spot to just play your
value fast so let's say you have nines
to just ship it in
oh or asus this is actually this is a
very
a play that not a lot of people make but
definitely a good play
and i think jassem could maybe just
check flop with his hands it's
definitely not a spot you want to be
betting too often
no you should definitely just take a
five to show them blind versus blind
book ambition there's a cool meme with
helmut touching gto and theory etc it's
a fun clip
to add during stream can you send me the
link ah joe
ingram has it on his channel i think
yeah tell me where it is
i love a good helmet clip who doesn't
like a good helmet clip are my helmet
clips
where are my helmet clips idiot players
call races with queen 10 they don't even
know how to spell poker i mean
how much you think helmet would lose in
this lineup
