today's episode
[Music]
hi there my fellow ambitious poker
players welcome back to another exciting

[01:00]
players welcome back to another exciting
episode of the mechanics of poker
podcast in which today we are going to
have a chat with high stakes poker
player yuri palek
uh
um often recommended guest yuri was

[01:15]
um often recommended guest yuri was
mentioned by various other podcast
guests as a guy who had a very big
impact on their poker career so
that made us very curious to have him on
he has years of experience playing
high-stakes poker and also coaching in
high-sex poker it took him around five

[01:30]
high-sex poker it took him around five
to six years to get to these stakes and
today we will walk you guys through the
path that led him there starting at the
early age being very competitive in
games in this case i think it was magic
the gathering which
i think is starting to become a little

[01:45]
i think is starting to become a little
bit of a tale of successful poker
players adam they all seem to have
excelled in either games or sports
before they became a successful poker
player
yeah i say it's a common trend that
we're starting to pick up from these
interviews and yeah he's definitely on

[02:02]
interviews and yeah he's definitely on
the elite side of the gamers go to a
really really high level in many games
and then yeah transitioned that into
having a successful poker career like
you mentioned he's been very highly
recommended to be honest i don't know
much about his background story so i'm

[02:15]
much about his background story so i'm
really intrigued to know how he's been
able to have success in poker i know
he's outside the box thinker who a lot
of players respect for his ability to uh
come with complex strategies and
simplify those in a good way so yeah i'm
really intrigued to see where this
conversation goes and bringing out yui's

[02:30]
conversation goes and bringing out yui's
story for the audience
all right let's have yuri on
all right there he is yuri palek thank
you for being on the pod
uh thanks for inviting me
happy to be here oh well we had we had
no choice to be honest because everyone

[02:45]
no choice to be honest because everyone
keeps on talking about you in the
podcast the comments have been shouting
yuri yuri so
it also made us very curious like we
have never met before we've never spoken
before obviously
i've heard about you i've heard about
guerrilla poker your your coaching site

[03:03]
guerrilla poker your your coaching site
yeah
obviously
a lot of respect so let's dive into your
story very curious about it i wanted to
start off at the beginning
you

[03:15]
you
are not new to being a big winner in
games
because you mentioned that when you were
i think 13 years old you became world
champion in magic the gathering
i actually played some magic the
gathering when i was younger as well but
never got further than

[03:30]
never got further than
playing against my friends
so i'm curious how does one
become a world champion imagine the
gathering when they are 13 years old can
you walk us through the childhood you
had
okay so i'll i'll start with the fact

[03:47]
okay so i'll i'll start with the fact
correction i i was world champion when i
was 24 years old
at 13 years old is when i started
playing magic
uh
i wish i'd been world champion and
actually when i was in school at the age

[04:00]
actually when i was in school at the age
of 13
they had us fill in on this piece of
paper like how do you imagine the rest
of your life at various ages
and i filled in that at age 21 i would
be the world champion in magic so i'm
actually three years late compared to

[04:16]
actually three years late compared to
the
but yeah i was thinking about it at age
13.
yeah no i've i've been in in strategy
games as long as i can remember myself
um
kind of the

[04:30]
kind of the
the first strategy game story i have is
probably when i was six or seven years
old
i was playing connect four you guys know
that game
i was playing connect four with my
mother
and she did this thing where there are
three next to each other and then any

[04:46]
three next to each other and then any
move you make you're gonna lose the next
move if i i don't know if you guys know
what i mean but i know
uh and and i was shocked because i was i
couldn't find a way to stop her winning
and i asked her how did you do that
and she told me how she did it and ever

[05:02]
and she told me how she did it and ever
since she told me she never won a game
that we played for the rest of our lives
uh because i i i had suddenly i had a
goal i had a strategy
uh and then i was all the time directing
the game and into making these kind of

[05:16]
the game and into making these kind of
situations
i was being deceptive about it like i
would distract her in other places in
the board i always knew kind of what i
was aiming at
um so yeah i think

[05:30]
um
that's kind of when i started strategy
games
um
i i started playing magic when i was 13
was also playing a bunch of other
computer strategy games the whole time
with friends
um
in magic i kind of got into the

[05:47]
in magic i kind of got into the
tournament scene in israel
i think i went to my first world
championship when i was 14 years old i
finished third in the national
championship and
kind of kept kept going i was playing

[06:00]
kind of kept kept going i was playing
magic all the time
thinking about it all the time kind of
like a lot of guys described with poker
i i didn't have that with poker i had
that with a different game where i was
dreaming about it playing all day not
not doing anything else
um

[06:16]
um
and there's actually
i know it's it's i'm very non-linear
with storytelling but that i actually
won the magic world championship
after i'd already retired from playing
magic
oh wow and and i think that has to do

[06:32]
oh wow and and i think that has to do
with uh with mental game a lot because
uh i'd always pumped really big in
international tournaments because of all
the stress
uh and that year because i was already
retired i was just going for fun because

[06:46]
retired i was just going for fun because
i was qualified
so there was no pressure and suddenly i
was able to play really really well
you still see that happening today for
example in poker for example we actually
had a guest on

[07:01]
had a guest on
previously
he also talked about he spews the most
when he's not happy in life and we kind
of talked about it's a sort of
self-sabotage right you spew off because
you don't want to be there
um is that something you sometimes
mention you see in your poker game as

[07:15]
mention you see in your poker game as
well when you're not happy
uh around poker that you notice you spew
more
um
yes i i often say that you know i always
think my win rate is the average of two

[07:32]
think my win rate is the average of two
players one is like a 15 bb winner and
the other is a 10 bb loser maybe or an
8bb loser and i i i vary between playing
one or the other version of myself
a lot and a lot of

[07:46]
a lot and a lot of
you know improving for me is recognizing
when and how to deal
like how to recognize that i shouldn't
be playing right now
um
and how to like part of the the issue
with this

[08:00]
with this
is it when you're in the mode when you
shouldn't be playing
uh your brain isn't working as well so
it's tougher to stop playing it's
tougher to think and
i'll i'll see the signs there but i'm
not in control enough to actually stop

[08:15]
not in control enough to actually stop
so it
this is like uh
definitely a very big challenge for me
throughout my whole career is dealing
with these kind of ups and downs like uh
even as a coach i can't tell you guys
how many times

[08:31]
how many times
a student has come to me and he said
look hurry i think i want to quit poker
i've been losing the last three months i
don't care about the game anymore
and i always ask them like uh what's up
in your personal life and there it's

[08:45]
in your personal life and there it's
always like i broke up with my
girlfriend three months ago my
grandmother died like there's always
something there that kind of shifts them
off track
it can be a really vicious circle for
people i'm sure you guys know this where

[09:00]
people i'm sure you guys know this where
when the the train goes off the track it
can take a while to get back on track
in that sense
yeah i think also in coaching i've done
a lot of coaching as well
like you're if you if your students are
the train right and you try to lay down

[09:15]
the train right and you try to lay down
a track for them to follow
it's not that you're trying to prevent
them from getting off track because they
will get off track i think the key is
realizing that you're off track faster
than before and course correcting back
to the normal track faster than before
right instead of being off to real for

[09:30]
right instead of being off to real for
like three four months being off-road
for only two months is huge progress
uh yeah for sure for sure and always uh
you know
in in the cfp that we have
uh we always tell people like if if
you're on a downswing you get as much

[09:45]
you're on a downswing you get as much
coaching as you need like that's when
you need to help the most
to get yourself back in the right
mindset
yeah i mean yeah you have to help those
people more right and then the people
are doing well okay yeah we will
compensate you when you know you are not

[10:00]
compensate you when you know you are not
doing so well
i think it's also i think it's also
interesting what you mentioned
that uh
especially i mean i don't really want to
throw away later throw labels but you're
more of an exploitative player you
mentioned that
you're either plus 15 or -10 and i see

[10:17]
you're either plus 15 or -10 and i see
that in general if you have a more
exploitative approach which i i have as
well and i have a good friend of me who
has that even to a more extreme uh
yeah you're just sometimes do something
genius but you know it's a thin line

[10:30]
genius but you know it's a thin line
between doing something genius and
spewing off completely so if you're
really in the mood you're indeed just
making genius plays always but if you're
not in that right state of mind you're
just spewing off is that kind of what
you were describing with either being
plus 15 bb or minus 10 bb where someone

[10:45]
plus 15 bb or minus 10 bb where someone
who's more gto will play a more
consistent game which is more average
the best exploitative player that i know
who's not me i have a friend who's a lot
better at it than i am
um
he had the most massive sharp down

[11:01]
he had the most massive sharp down
swings i've ever seen in a professional
player in my life because
he had such a range in his play where he
could do such crazy sick things
and if your brain is not calibrated
correctly if you're not in the right
mental state

[11:15]
mental state
and you go further like i'll check shove
the river
with a complete air against your over
bet
but you do it without the correct cues
and without the correct information
suddenly you're just a massive spew well
right like you're you're just playing

[11:30]
right like you're you're just playing
terrible
um and very often when i'm not in a good
state of mind what i find is that i'm
making exploitative adjustments too
quickly and too sharply
whereas if i were playing gto

[11:45]
whereas if i were playing gto
there is not that kind of range in my
game
like i will just get to a spot
i'll rng
maybe i'll pick the wrong combo so i'll
lose one big blind but you'll never see
like like i do some crazy [ __ ] when i

[12:00]
like like i do some crazy [ __ ] when i
play like i i can i can be completely
off the rails
so
you know call call you down for 600 big
blinds with ace high i can double float
air to raise wherever you like
everything's in there so if i'm not
playing well it can get bad really

[12:15]
playing well it can get bad really
really fast
yeah and then it's also
you you then try to force it i guess
right it then comes less natural that if
you have a good flow the place comes
intuitive whereas else you're trying to
okay i have to make these good plays and
they're just trying to force and create

[12:30]
they're just trying to force and create
spots that basically aren't really spots
yeah when i'm in a good mood i'm i'm
just playing and the spots come to me uh
when i'm i'm in a bad state of mind i'm
more looking for the spots i'm like okay
i know this worked well last time i'm

[12:46]
i know this worked well last time i'm
more reactive to the situation like my
last bluff he caught so i'm not gonna
bluff this time
everything is a lot more emotional
[Music]
it's a lot less nuanced and connected
and i might be reacting to someone's

[13:01]
and i might be reacting to someone's
timing
even though it's not the it's tough to
say like that the brain puts one and two
and three together often
in ways which we're not consciously
aware of so
if you try to rationalize everything

[13:17]
if you try to rationalize everything
when you're an exploitative player
you're just going to get a bunch of
stuff wrong i think
because there's too much information to
process and in the the amount of time
you have to make a decision
so if you want to be aggressive you can

[13:31]
so if you want to be aggressive you can
find
reasons to be aggressive i actually have
a kind of a new habit i'm working on
because i'm a bit of a calling station
um in in poker so
what often happens to me with a long
time back is i'll get to the river the

[13:46]
time back is i'll get to the river the
guy will make a big bet
my first instinct is okay i have to fold
then i'll start time banking i'll think
about it in the last five seconds i'll
convince myself to call somehow
so
i'm not allowing myself to do that

[14:01]
i'm not allowing myself to do that
anymore
like if the decision the decision is
fault
even if i really want to call i'll i'm
more disciplined i won't kind of get
sucked into
so you take your bias in consideration

[14:15]
so you take your bias in consideration
in your decision making i say this to my
students as well so if you see a spot
for example you get a hero folder and a
hero caller right there's their main
tendency and you have them look at the
same spot they will focus on the reasons
to call the other one will focus on the
reasons to fault so then i say okay

[14:30]
reasons to fault so then i say okay
you guys should you don't have to change
everything you know about poker it's
just you have to take in consideration
with buyers so if you think it's a close
call but you're a calling station it's
probably your fault so it's close call
but i'm biased so i'm a fault and same
same for the other guy so

[14:46]
same for the other guy so
how do we then close the gap
between
these ranges right of game you already
mentioned gto for example if you are
very blocker oriented
you stay within a certain range right
you're never gonna go too out of line

[15:00]
you're never gonna go too out of line
because you only pick a good block at a
certain frequency whereas i've certainly
been guilty of well this guy's just
gonna fall so i have the worst blocker
possible i don't care it's gonna go in
right how do we then close the gap is
that gto the way to close the gap

[15:15]
that gto the way to close the gap
um so i want to first add another thing
to what you were saying about biases
i i think people have an emotional bias
with hands so i always say if if you
have trips or you have an over pair

[15:30]
have trips or you have an over pair
and you're not sure about calling or
folding then definitely fault
uh well if you have aced high or bottom
pair and you're not sure then definitely
call i think that that's also kind of a
bias correction heuristic
um
it's worked fairly well for me

[15:47]
it's worked fairly well for me
uh although it's tough then it's tough
to fold trips right like
even if you know that it's still tough
um but
yeah i i think knowing gto helps
um

[16:00]
um
for sure because
that also limits you like the the more
you know
gto um
the easier it is
to excuse a bad play
i'm sorry to call gto a bad play

[16:15]
i'm sorry to call gto a bad play
but often people will make like a
terrible bluff or a terrible call
and they know it's bad but they know
that they get to make it 30 of the time
and they they'll be okay
like this is gto it can't be too bad and
like uh

[16:30]
like uh
i i think from from hearing you speak we
agree that there are calls that gto
would make that are massively losing
calls
so i think it can go both way with gto
and i do have friends who when they're
tilted they tell me i play more gto when

[16:47]
tilted they tell me i play more gto when
i'm tilted
like i i use gto as an excuse to bluff
or to call or to fold
rather than listening to
like what i know about the game that is

[17:00]
like what i know about the game that is
beyond and deeper and more practical
than gto they start to ignore that and
they just like knowing both you can have
an excuse for any decision you want to
make
right you can call for an exploitative
reason or you can call for a gto reason

[17:15]
reason or you can call for a gto reason
you always
i i don't think gto really protects you
in that sense unless you play pure gto
which i think is a terrible idea unless
you're a super genius like you know some
guys can pull it off and be the best in

[17:30]
guys can pull it off and be the best in
the world
um like la linus phil galphond
me doug polk maybe like some guys can
study gto and just be the best in the
world at doing that
uh but i think for most people trying to

[17:46]
uh but i think for most people trying to
mimic gto is not a very good idea
and the frequencies in a solver are also
very biased right by a sensitive
something is a frequency 50 50. if
you're in general a guy who gives up
more you will find a reason ah this time

[18:01]
more you will find a reason ah this time
no and the guy who always
uh wants to bluff sees it as oh 50 50
that means i can bluff this and then
we'll basically always bluff this so
again it's very bias sensitive i also
always like it when people
start a hand history where they start

[18:15]
start a hand history where they start
with a very exploitative reason on the
flop right they say oh i oversee that
this flop because it's going to overfall
and then they arrive to the river they
face a bet and say well now i have a gto
frequency call i'm like wait but the
range that he now arrived on the river
is different because i would say when

[18:30]
is different because i would say when
you enter when you enter the exploit
tree right when you hop on the exploit
train on the earlier street you cannot
suddenly make a gto reasoning on the
later street right
i i actually had a
interesting conversation with a friend
about that yesterday
he was in a multi-way pot and one of the

[18:46]
he was in a multi-way pot and one of the
guys with was a calling station
so he told me okay i'm never bluffing
because he's a calling station so i'll
check my value hands to be balanced
and
i was like that that's not how
exploitative poker works

[19:05]
that doesn't seem right so yeah it's
very easy to confuse and also like the
50 percent river like you said has to do
with the range you arrive at the river

[19:15]
with
uh and very often you're making a
frequency mistake on earlier streets so
really the frequency there doesn't have
anything to do with optimal player not
getting there with the correct range
almost any nobody is
so you're kind of deluding yourself in a

[19:31]
so you're kind of deluding yourself in a
way i i still think it's even a nice
mental safety net for randomized
sometimes
but uh yeah agree agree with what you
said a hundred percent
actually that's interesting just that
i've been recently trying to implement
that as well as a mental safety net and

[19:47]
that as well as a mental safety net and
also to prevent your bias that if i
really don't have a good reason
that i at least do it's 50 50. right i i
really cannot figure this out yeah 50 50
so my bias cannot unconsciously override
me
and and then you get less tilted as well

[20:02]
and and then you get less tilted as well
i think if you lose because you're like
okay i was only doing it 50 50. so it's
okay to call and lose well if you play
pure exploit i think the
the times you lose hurt a bit more than
if you randomize

[20:15]
if you randomize
yeah actually i had this question
written down four four later but hey
we're talking about that now indeed like
i think exploitative play is harder on
the mental game because if you're wrong
you were wrong it's very personal
whereas people are your silver approach

[20:30]
whereas people are your silver approach
they say well the solver told me to do
this so you basically put responsibility
in the hand of the solver while the
solver said it it was a call so i take
no responsibility in the fact that i
made a bad call right whereas
exploitatively you make a bluff because
you think it's a good bluff and the guy

[20:45]
you think it's a good bluff and the guy
calls you with a hand that you should
never call that means you made a
terrible bluff right
yeah and and variance is really
deceptive especially with bluff catching
because you might make a bluff catch
that's not gto because you think the guy

[21:00]
that's not gto because you think the guy
is over bluffing the spawn
he just shows you the nuts
it's a huge pot
how are you gonna feel you're never
gonna know if you were correct or not
and if you just play gto you would be
like okay like this is how the spot
plays he has his range i have my range i

[21:17]
plays he has his range i have my range i
played fine
but if you're making like you know
sometimes on the river i have a bluff
catcher i'm not randomizing 40 percent
i'm zero or a hundred i come i'm
thinking and making the decision
um so yeah it's a lot more personal it's

[21:32]
um so yeah it's a lot more personal it's
a lot more sensitive to tilt in a game b
game c game
uh
it it it's a it's a different world i
think it it fits a different personality
of claire as well but

[21:45]
of claire as well but
like to me this is poker i don't think
if if you want to do the gto
memorization
you should be playing a different game
in my eyes like you should play chess
some game where

[22:00]
i i know it's less about personality
more about analysis if if you want to
just perform gto solutions
you you mentioned chess as well and you
also mentioned before that you were
playing hearthstone on top of magic the
gathering how does

[22:16]
gathering how does
gto and exploitative play how does that
look in you also mentioned chess right
if you want to play more gto play chess
how do gto plays exploitive plays
look like a magic together in
hearthstone chess

[22:31]
hearthstone chess
um it's an interesting question so each
of these games is super different even
though they are similar
i think both chess and magic the
gathering are games where there is a lot
less hidden information than there is in

[22:45]
less hidden information than there is in
poker
so very often
there are clearly very good plays and
very bad place it's not you don't need
to know your opponent's range as much
um so it's a lot more about seeing a
situation and analyzing it correctly and

[23:01]
situation and analyzing it correctly and
coming up with a good game plan
um
in terms of gto and exploitative um
i i would say

[23:15]
you know maybe an exploitative approach
to the games would be
to bank on your opponents making
mistakes
rather than
assuming they they react correctly
and very often that will open avenues

[23:30]
and very often that will open avenues
for you to win which wouldn't exist if
they played correctly but there there is
a lot less room
for exploitative play in those games
it's more about
um i i think all all three of those
games they have two elements there's the

[23:47]
games they have two elements there's the
play itself which is just looking at the
board analyzing making a good decision
and very often
everyone will agree what is the correct
decision there won't be different
approaches like it's too there's too
much information for good players to

[24:01]
much information for good players to
really argue
um
but a lot of the the creativity in those
games actually comes into the
preparation and the decisions that you
make before you start playing
uh so in hearthstone and magic the

[24:15]
uh so in hearthstone and magic the
gathering and maybe to a degree chess
you are actually
like magic the gathering is a game where
there are over 10 000 different cards
and each player
constructs the deck of cards he's going

[24:30]
constructs the deck of cards he's going
to the tournament with and i think in
the deck construction so before you
start playing when you're preparing the
cards and the strategy
that's where there is room for for
exploitative strategy for guessing
what your opponents are going to be

[24:45]
what your opponents are going to be
doing and how to counter it and how they
might try to counter you and all all
those kinds of things
happen before you sit down to play in
these games
and do you know the other players deck
no no you you don't you don't know his

[25:01]
no no you you don't you don't know his
and he doesn't know yours
uh you can sometimes guess because there
are like the deck that won the previous
tournament
so so you have some information what
people are likely to play

[25:15]
people are likely to play
but yeah i think my my big strength in
magic the gathering has always been in
this aspect
so in terms of uh you know if there's
technical play
in magic the gathering i was maybe top
100 in the world

[25:30]
100 in the world
um but when it came to the strategy that
you make before you play uh preparing
the deck
in a way that's good for the people
you're playing against i was probably
top 5 in the world
so it was mainly in the anticipating of

[25:45]
so it was mainly in the anticipating of
what your opponent is going to do that
kind of
made you construct your deck and maybe
in poker play your hand a certain way i
don't know you set a certain trap on the
flop because you know what he's going
how he's going to anticipate right what
he's going to do on later street that

[26:00]
he's going to do on later street that
gives you the exploitative edge
i think it's also about
understanding which cards and which
strategies work together
what kind of synergies there are in the
game
synergy i don't know if the synergy
applies to poker but in magic very often

[26:16]
applies to poker but in magic very often
you're trying to in hearthstone as well
use your cards together
uh so how you use them what is effective
against one strategy or the other what
isn't effective
uh i i can tell you guys a story from

[26:32]
uh i i can tell you guys a story from
actually the championship that i won and
the quarterfinals
i was playing against a genius player
from japan katsu hiro mori
a much more successful player than i was

[26:45]
a much more successful player than i was
he was a previous world champion and he
went like back to back top four in the
world year after year in this format
and he was a lot sharper technically
than i was
uh but i was out maneuvering him in all

[27:00]
uh but i was out maneuvering him in all
the strategic aspects as we were playing
like by a huge margin and and these
these two things that they're both part
of it right both part of your success so
in poker
if you think about uh

[27:15]
if you think about uh
when you're playing uh
like there's so much information to
think about my range and his range and
the timing and the board and the
positions and everything is shifting
maybe you think about your opponent's
mood
so some people are able to do these

[27:31]
so some people are able to do these
things really well i have you know a
friend who was one of you know a high
stakes cash game player for years and
years he never touched a solver
he had like huge leaks all over his game
but he was just really really sharp and

[27:45]
but he was just really really sharp and
really thinking fast and adjusting on
his feet and he he managed to stay
successful at the highest levels with
with no theory background whatsoever
um
while
you know obviously if you take that guy

[28:00]
you know obviously if you take that guy
and you give him a good theory
background he would
do a lot better obviously
um
so yeah i think my strength has always
been
developing good strategies good
exploitative strategies specifically

[28:15]
exploitative strategies specifically
to counter what's currently going on
adjusting to player types well in terms
of game plan
simplifying solver outputs understanding
kind of what is and what isn't important
and then in the end you know you give

[28:31]
and then in the end you know you give
that to someone he has to implement it
some guys are
super good at that some guys are a lot
slower
each one needs his own
kind of game plan you know some
sometimes some of the best players i

[28:45]
sometimes some of the best players i
know start talking about
like i have ace of clubs queen of spades
these are the absolute best suits to
triple barrel bluff with on this random
board and i i like my brain is not
capable of understanding that in-game i
i don't think that that deep

[29:02]
i don't think that that deep
you just think like is this guy a guy
who is going to fault
yes
okay i'll pull the trigger regardless of
my suits yeah i'm i'm
which if you would look at the impact a

[29:15]
which if you would look at the impact a
player profile would have on the fault
equity of your bluff that's going to be
higher than the ace of spades queen of
clubs right
yeah but if that guy is really good he
can do both
like some people can do both of those

[29:30]
like some people can do both of those
true and also you know you
understand when blockers are important
when blockers aren't important if the
guy value bets 20 combos and you block
four of them that seems quite relevant
whereas if the guy valuables 200 combos
and you block four of them it's not very
relevant
whereas people

[29:46]
whereas people
are solving for solver it's equally
relevant right because you know it's the
the ev difference is gonna be very small
but always the
kind of the tipping point between
calling or folding whereas in practice
we should
first underestimate what are the blocker

[30:01]
first underestimate what are the blocker
impacts in this exact spot
and then see okay how high should
blockers on blockers be taking in
consideration in my decision making yeah
and i think always whenever i look at
solar outputs i'm not looking so much at

[30:15]
solar outputs i'm not looking so much at
what the solver considers correct or
incorrect more at what the solver
considers close or not close
so if it's a 200 big blind pot and the
solver thinks your call is winning three
big blinds on the river
i i think that just means it's close i i

[30:32]
i i think that just means it's close i i
don't think three or minus three are any
different in the 200 big blind pot
um
it's confusing because the solver will
show you like always call this always
fold this always block that always give

[30:45]
fold this always block that always give
up that
and like you're saying sometimes there
is a huge difference
considering blockers but very often
the differences are very very minor and
you should be focused on something else
so the kind of thought process i like to

[31:01]
so the kind of thought process i like to
use
when i get to a decision
you know i always think about the theory
and i think okay i think my blockers are
such where
this is close or this is bad or this is
good
and then i stop and i think okay what

[31:16]
and then i stop and i think okay what
about all the other million things that
are going on that would push me in one
direction or another and they're often
worth so much more than the two percent
that the blockers are worth
yeah there's even kind of a mathematical
model for this that you could use

[31:30]
model for this that you could use
sometimes where
uh you're making a bluff catching
decision and the solver thinks it's
three bb per 100 and then you're like
okay he needs to to bet this range i
think
you know there is a 30 chance that he

[31:45]
you know there is a 30 chance that he
will never have bluffs because it's very
unintuitive
uh if he were some over aggro maniac i
would know so there's no chance of that
and then there's a 70 chance he probably
bluffs enough like a gto player and once

[32:00]
bluffs enough like a gto player and once
you start breaking down things like that
where there is a chance my opponent is
never bluffing here and there is a very
low chance he's over bluffing then
the decision suddenly becomes crystal
clear with with no
you don't need to think about blockers
anymore you're just like

[32:17]
anymore you're just like
you know if if 70 percent of the time
i'm winning three big blinds and and 30
of the time i'm losing 70 big blinds the
map is fairly simple
yeah i usually talk about thinking in
best versus worst case scenarios best

[32:30]
best versus worst case scenarios best
case scenario he does reach a gto
frequency and indeed you have a
reasonably break even call worst case
scenario he never has a bluff
and you're you're just punting away your
stack right
yeah and as long as you're not playing
guys like linus or stefan or like the

[32:47]
guys like linus or stefan or like the
this the agroest maniac in your player
pool you you can be fairly sure
uh very few people manage to be as
maniacal as a gto
songer would
yeah like i think i already mentioned

[33:02]
yeah like i think i already mentioned
even though we never spoke before the
potter set i think we think very similar
about poker which up until now
i can definitely confirm i was actually
already getting excited when you were
talking about magic and you were talking
about preparing a deck and you look at

[33:15]
about preparing a deck and you look at
okay what decks have been very popular
and then you can already think people
are probably gonna show up with this
deck how can i counter that deck and
that was always how i approach poker as
well right like okay who are my players
what are their tendencies first we have
to realize that everyone plays different
right people already close up their mind

[33:30]
right people already close up their mind
because they think oh everyone nowadays
plays the same well they are not looking
good enough everyone has different
tendencies because we're playing against
humans and i think the most interesting
part in poker is trying to figure out
what kind of tendencies this guy has and
how i can shift my strategy to take most

[33:46]
how i can shift my strategy to take most
advantage of that
and and that there is so much depth to
that i think a lot of people as they're
moving up they have this illusion that
the game is solved and everyone's super
good and
i
um
it's really holding them back

[34:01]
it's really holding them back
there is so much uh
so much room for for gaining an
advantage and
actually something i was thinking about
the other day
uh and and i i assume again from what

[34:15]
uh and and i i assume again from what
i'm hearing that you're the same if i
would sit at an nl 200 cash game table
with one big whale and four regulars
i would not be playing as though i'm
playing against one whale and four
regulars i would be thinking okay there

[34:30]
regulars i would be thinking okay there
is one big fish and four small fish at
the table
uh so
what like how do i i'm gonna exploit
each and every one of you
you know they're saying like at the
table if you can't spot the fish then
you're the fish

[34:45]
you're the fish
so if you treat the other regulars like
they are just very good gto machines
that then you are the fish uh you are
the target
um
i i think uh you know kind kind of if
we're talking advice for people moving

[35:00]
we're talking advice for people moving
up you
don't be afraid all the
like online poker is is super beatable
everyone is super bad
i'm telling you this is
like at all stakes even at high stakes
every i mean not everyone for the most
part lots of people are making mistakes

[35:17]
part lots of people are making mistakes
it it it's uh
it's a battle you know we're playing
poker this isn't chess this isn't
science we're
we're only human no one is mimicking
stuff correctly
and even

[35:31]
and even
like
even at high stakes a lot of people are
simplifying their strategies
in very obvious ways
and there are huge counters you can make
to that and they have no clue how what
to do about those like at every level

[35:46]
to do about those like at every level
there's there's tons of room to
to treat people as fish and and have fun
rather than kind of being afraid and
playing defense
yeah but you first need to have that
break that belief right there are things

[36:01]
break that belief right there are things
you can look for because if you think
everyone is gto then why would you even
start looking right because i also
sometimes i see people that say yeah
he's a wreck i'm like okay what kind of
rack yeah this is my tag for wreck this
is my tech for fish then they have two
colors i'm like okay you're missing a
lot of nuances here oh we're talking

[36:16]
lot of nuances here oh we're talking
about the spewie spewie rag and knitty
rack you know it's like come on we need
more information here to make good
decisions and especially
like you mentioned right on the river
two on the big blind pots well if there
you can avoid a minus seven db call

[36:31]
you can avoid a minus seven db call
i think that has quite a big impact on
your win rate
compared to finding the optimal flop
sizing
i have flops i don't don't get me
started on people who look for the
optimal flop sizing but uh
that that's uh yeah one one of the the

[36:47]
that that's uh yeah one one of the the
biggest black holes for useless poker
time that people spend
but
yeah i would say maybe a good heuristic
for people is you know if you are not
yet playing
uh nosebleeds online uh there is no reg

[37:02]
uh nosebleeds online uh there is no reg
tag
uh it's either a reg fish an aggro reg
fish or an itty reg fish but there is no
rag there are no rags
i like that i like that because it
automatically makes you search right

[37:15]
automatically makes you search right
because you don't give him the credit
no no nobody deserves credit and then
poker i mean it's as a mentality of
course some people are going to be
better than you are
um
and and i'm like like we're all fish i'm
i'm also like a stationary fish myself

[37:31]
i'm also like a stationary fish myself
as a self-admitted one
uh but uh yeah i think the mentality you
need in order to succeed in poker
is to to think that uh you can gain an
edge against your opponents and if you

[37:45]
edge against your opponents and if you
feel like you can't gain an edge and all
you can do is break even
then that's all you're gonna do you're
just gonna break even
like you'll win off the fish you'll lose
it to the rake and and and that's where
it's gonna end
very good stuff very good stuff adam i

[38:02]
very good stuff very good stuff adam i
uh
what is your experience with
exploitive players and their messed up
mental game or at least their their
bigger struggles let's
let's keep it that way
yeah it was very interesting to hear
both of you talk about the difference

[38:15]
both of you talk about the difference
between being a kind of gto player and
an intuition exploit player both of you
you guys fit into the exploits intuitive
guys and yeah just acknowledging that
that comes with a higher amount of tall
on the mental bandwidth you've got to

[38:30]
on the mental bandwidth you've got to
have a lot more and self-doubt in your
game like yuri was saying he's got this
big divide between his games he's like
the best player in the world plus 15 bb
win rates or is that drop off to minus
one i think when you are that type of
player you do need to spend a lot of
time on looking for ways to protect

[38:46]
time on looking for ways to protect
yourself like yuri was saying like just
acknowledging i'm going to have times
when i shouldn't be playing i shouldn't
be trying to force myself to get
creative here i'm actually i shouldn't
be playing the game so i think building
clear profiles and understanding when
your amazing exploits are now hitting

[39:01]
your amazing exploits are now hitting
you and you need to uh want to protect
yourself by taking breaks or getting out
the games all together during those
times so yeah i think the intuitive
players have the harder job and they
need to do more work on the mental game
and pay more attention to their ebbs and
flaws and their moods going into

[39:15]
flaws and their moods going into
sessions whereas the logical gto players
like you guys will see them have more
safety nets they can just follow a
framework and they're less involved
emotionally because they've always got
jto did it not me so there's less of you
involved in it and also there's also a

[39:31]
involved in it and also there's also a
system that you're following where you
don't need to solve every situation on
the fly you can just rely on a kind of
default so yeah from my experience i
think the
a lot of players who i work with big
down swings who lose confidence in their
game are generally the more intuitive

[39:45]
game are generally the more intuitive
players and they almost lose confidence
in the skill that has given them their
edge and as a result they've got like
rebuild that confidence and go oh like
you he talked about his friend he was
amazing when i'm on the most extreme
down swings and that's because obviously
variance involves that strategy but also

[40:00]
variance involves that strategy but also
when you lose your confidence in those
kind of players there's almost like
nothing to hold on to whereas gto always
creates a kind of safety net under an
anchor to return to see i think
intuitive players have the the harder
job in all honesty especially from a
mindset perspective and yeah it's just
been very aware of it and like yuri was

[40:16]
been very aware of it and like yuri was
talking about trying to build build a
profile of when you're
into that minus range of your game tree
and yeah just find a way to spot it
earlier and finding countless to that is
going to be higher ev than anything else
so yeah that'll be my kind of experience
with that i wanted to add something to

[40:30]
with that i wanted to add something to
that because i do think if i see a
change in my game implementing or
understanding more theory compared to
how i played before which was just pure
exploits but after solvers came out and
started to understand more theory that
did help me create sort of a fundament

[40:45]
did help me create sort of a fundament
that my game can drop until a certain
point but there it stops it no longer
goes to like -10 but due to just
you know being able to play sort of in
line when i don't feel at my best my
basically my bottom is not as bad
anymore ever since i got better in

[41:01]
anymore ever since i got better in
theory
yeah yeah and unless you play against
two really big fish because then then
you don't rely on the theory safety net
so it can still no but but that's the
good thing from that strong base now
i am able to constantly exploit right so

[41:17]
i am able to constantly exploit right so
i feel like right now i'm in a spot
where i keep the benefits obviously the
benefits i think will be a bit reduced
because your mind will sometimes make
gto traps are like oh why the [ __ ] did i
think about this this is way theory

[41:30]
think about this this is way theory
oriented so the top is a bit less on the
top i would say but i think it's worth
it compared to how deep the bottoms were
basically
yeah i'm i i mean i i think it has to be
a foundation these days because
uh you know a lot of people are

[41:46]
uh you know a lot of people are
implementing strategies that are very
unintuitive and if you don't understand
what they're doing you cannot really
counter it
um like all the solver strategies and
the solver combos and the stuff that's
going on you can't hand read unless you

[42:00]
going on you can't hand read unless you
understand how bet sizes work and how
ranges work and
like suddenly someone check raises you
and he shows middle pair years ago that
that would never have happened unless he
was a recreational
and if you're trying to exploit and you

[42:16]
and if you're trying to exploit and you
know it it's important like the more you
understand the better
like you were saying you don't need to
know
the exact frequencies that is not very
useful
but definitely the i know you guys i

[42:31]
but definitely the i know you guys i
love the name of your course the
mechanics of poker i think if if you
understand the mechanics of poker
a brilliant name really brilliant name
uh then you can use that both as a
foundation
where
you know you are

[42:46]
you know you are
deviating from something good like you
have the solid baseline you don't have
to guess at everything
um you know when i was moving up in
stakes
i i was pure exploiting every single
situation like pure

[43:01]
situation like pure
200 exploitative play game plan
uh 35 percent check raise flop
uh all sorts of like crazy crazy things
this was until 2012 or so
um

[43:15]
um
and and i i had all these crazy leveling
wars and i i i was crushing everyone
moving up and then i moved up to to a
stake where
like people were actually adjusting to
me in good ways they were calling me
down in spots where i was always

[43:30]
down in spots where i was always
bluffing
they were defending the ranges better
and i was super lost i had no clue what
to do because other than looking at your
heart and your full two three but i
don't know what the three betting range
looks like
like if you're fall to three that looks

[43:45]
like if you're fall to three that looks
okay what like what am i supposed to do
now i don't know
uh so so to have the
the background and understanding how
things work i think is is mandatory at
that some level like you you could
probably beat nl 200

[44:00]
probably beat nl 200
with with almost no background if i had
to guess on a lot of sites but at some
point it's mandatory to get this for
your own mental health
yeah it seems like for you you do well
once you understand a strategy and then
you can exploit from that reminds me of
the story you're told about playing

[44:15]
the story you're told about playing
connect four with your mum and as soon
as you knew the strategy you're like all
right i know now now i'm in exploit zone
good luck so like having that base of
strategy to refer to seems to work
really well for you to be able to uh
yeah exploit around that like you said
you need a foundation to know when

[44:31]
you need a foundation to know when
someone re-exploits you back what's the
next move if you don't know that you end
up lost at some point so yeah having
that kind of base is always always going
to be useful especially for the way your
mind works
uh yeah so so the the the course i just
put out with with upswing exploitative

[44:47]
put out with with upswing exploitative
cash game exploits there is a section
about sea betting
and you guys probably know this where
you know there's this equilibrium where
if someone c bets too much you start
check raising them all the time
but most people do not check raise

[45:01]
but most people do not check raise
enough so the exploit is to see that too
much like this is uh i think something
most exploitative players are aware of
these days it's one of the first things
that jumps out when you look at sea
betting strategies
um

[45:15]
um
and one one of the important things that
i talk about there is like this is step
one of what's going on like there's c
betting too much the guy check raises
how do you counter the guy who check
raises too much
how do you do you re like or if you see

[45:30]
how do you do you re like or if you see
that too much which ways can people
counter you which of these can you see
and which will you not like will you be
able to see if someone check raises you
too much that's a tough thing to see how
do you know if someone's countering you
like that there's a lot of depth to
thinking about these things you can use

[45:46]
thinking about these things you can use
solvers to figure them out
uh if you use solvers creatively or node
locking you're you're changing things up
and not just like okay this is the gto
let's randomize eighty percent see that
because you know if someone see that's

[46:01]
because you know if someone see that's
one third part on a lot of boards
he's not randomizing eighty percent he's
doing a hundred percent so we're
automatically in a leveling war on the
flop
most people i think don't realize that
this is even going on

[46:15]
this is even going on
uh but yeah there are lots of level
strategic levels to this to to all of
the exploits at various levels to think
about
would you say the person who knows the
more steps or the most levels ahead in
that exploit war generally has the

[46:31]
that exploit war generally has the
biggest edge
i mean like i was saying before it's
part of the edges knowing more and part
of the edges being able to think very
quickly and accurately when you're in
the situation
uh the the best player is going to be

[46:46]
uh the the best player is going to be
the one who thinks the best and deepest
and also knows the most and also has the
most stable mindset
like if you asked me what would be the
biggest boost to my win rate at this
point it has to be mindset like no

[47:00]
point it has to be mindset like no
question if i could eliminate the times
where i shouldn't be playing
i can't imagine anything else it would
help my win rate more than that
being in the zone more being you know
punting less doing stuff where a second
later i know it's terrible

[47:16]
later i know it's terrible
uh so so that there are lots of aspects
this is like this is definitely one of
them it's just one of many aspects i
think like poker is a very
very multi-dimensional game being
successful in poker you can't be good at
just one thing

[47:31]
just one thing
yeah so what are you doing currently to
work on your biggest mindset leak of
spotting when you're putting in almost
like protecting yourself by
not playing in those in those states so
what are you doing currently to uh can
eradicate those those bad playing i was

[47:47]
ah
this is not i'm not proud of how i
handled these things but um
i i think one one thing i do is i i do
shorter sessions with breaks in between
so that the session length is a limiting

[48:01]
so that the session length is a limiting
factor like i can't punt off for four
hours because there's there's a
mandatory break in between
um
and other things i'm doing is i'm trying
to recognize patterns
uh like i know for example that

[48:16]
uh like i know for example that
if i don't feel like doing chores then i
shouldn't be playing poker
like that that is the mindset if i just
want to gamble and have fun or let some
steam off and that's not a good mindset
for poker so there are like tests i can

[48:31]
for poker so there are like tests i can
make
like i sit down at the computer i know i
need to call the bank
if i don't feel like calling the bank i
will not play poker
uh but yeah it's that there's tons of
stuff going on there i've done a decent
amount of work with jared tendler uh

[48:47]
amount of work with jared tendler uh
who's helped me a lot uh really smart
guy
um
and uh yeah it's it's an ongoing process
for me like still not not my my best
skill for sure yeah i like that one if

[49:01]
skill for sure yeah i like that one if
um if you don't want to ring the bank
it's a good sign that you're in a state
of mind that isn't going to be conducive
to your your best poker performance i'm
all going to have unique kind of
tendencies so yeah i think building that
self-awareness of your patterns is kind
of the first step then from there you've

[49:16]
of the first step then from there you've
got the option to either protect
yourself by not playing and shortening
your sessions like you were doing then
the long term solution is finding a
resolution to those issues how do i
change my state of mind when i'm in this
suboptimal state how can i prime myself

[49:30]
suboptimal state how can i prime myself
to be in a more
advanced state of mind going into game
but yeah i think self-awareness and
spotting those patterns going forward is
the yeah it takes time like you said
it's not a one-fix thing it takes a
lifetime to spot your own tendencies and
your own patterns and the way you show
up and the things that impact you and

[49:46]
up and the things that impact you and
yeah kind of the kind of the game tree
of your mental the game takes a while to
to figure out so to it's a work in
progress
so i'd love to bring it back to you your
story and back to uh almost like
starting out in polka to be honest i
know we had the you basically been a
world champion in magic the gathering

[50:01]
world champion in magic the gathering
and yeah i'm really intrigued to know
how the transition to pokemons i think
it's from my perspective someone who's
been a world champion at 23 before going
into another game i'm guessing there's
some form of expectations going into
poca or at least some form of ego
thinking you know what i'm good at

[50:16]
thinking you know what i'm good at
strategy games so uh tell us when you
first got into poker how were you
approaching it in terms of a strategy
game and did you have a high expectation
or high ego going into that
um
so i'll i'll give you guys some
background um i think i started poker at

[50:31]
background um i think i started poker at
an older age than most people
and uh like like i said i was playing
lots of strategy games not just magic
and poker and that's it
um
i i remember thinking at various points

[50:46]
i i remember thinking at various points
in my life when i i'd do something like
to completely crush a strategy game and
the game was you know me and my friends
would often stop playing after because i
was like we would know the best strategy
and there was no point

[51:00]
and there was no point
i often thought
you know i was so happy and so proud to
do that but it's such a shame that
nobody really cares except me and my
body who i play the game with
and
i never imagined i was going to be a
competitive gamer um

[51:16]
competitive gamer um
i you know i i finished my ba in
university i i went to work in a startup
in computer science
um and what happened to me there was
that the guy sitting at the desk next to

[51:30]
that the guy sitting at the desk next to
me
was super passionate about programming
and he was a friend of mine and he kept
telling me you know let's work on a
computer game let's do this project
let's do that project
and i would like when i would get home i
just want to play games i never want i

[51:45]
just want to play games i never want i
didn't even think one second about
programming
and
kind of my family background my mother
is in career counseling
um and i was always very
very much thinking that you know your

[52:00]
very much thinking that you know your
profession is where you spend
maybe one third to half of your hours as
a grown up
and it is just as important as picking
like finding the right
person to spend the rest of your life

[52:16]
person to spend the rest of your life
with it's a super important thing
so seeing him uh made me decide you know
i'm good at programming uh it's fine
like i i enjoy it somewhat but there is
no passion there

[52:30]
no passion there
so what happened was i i quit
programming
um and i decided to study psychology
and at the same time i started to play
poker with my friends
and i remember this moment where me i i

[52:45]
and i remember this moment where me i i
went over to a friend's house we played
like a five or ten dollar mtt together
and uh we we won first place two
thousand five hundred dollars
and it was such a powerful experience
for me where the the entire next day

[53:03]
for me where the the entire next day
i just walked around the streets kind of
daydreaming like is it actually possible
to make a living
doing doing this kind of thing i i was
completely shocked and i never imagined

[53:15]
completely shocked and i never imagined
this could be something i could do
uh because like you guys have to
understand i don't know how old both of
you guys are but competitive gaming
being something you can make a living at
did not exist when i was growing up like
that we started having internet at home

[53:31]
that we started having internet at home
when i was 16 years old like this is not
something i grew up thinking was an
option
and as i was playing poker and starting
out and all these stories moving up my
my biggest ambition in poker was like

[53:45]
my biggest ambition in poker was like
you know i'm enjoying myself so much
uh if i can make as much money as i
could if i i was like you know if i can
make a hundred dollars a day i'm good
that that's where i want to be in poker
and uh

[54:02]
yeah like looking at where i am now i i
would never have imagined uh
i'm i'm super grateful to the game and i
think a lot of the like i i was always
moving upstairs slowly

[54:16]
moving upstairs slowly
i hate risk i i hate gambling
like this is not
not something that appeals to me
instinctively i think for me losing
money hurts a lot more than winning
uh i i already kind of had my

[54:30]
uh i i already kind of had my
competitive appetite satisfied in magic
the gathering
so i was just kind of thinking as a
grown-up like where is my life going to
be and like i finished my degree in
psychology at the same time i was living

[54:45]
psychology at the same time i was living
with friends all playing poker together
and you know at that point the choice
was very obvious where
you know psychology
is like four more years of study and
then four years working at minimum wage
and you know i get to see if i enjoy the

[55:01]
and you know i get to see if i enjoy the
work or not
and you know i was grinding sit and goes
as i was studying for tests i loved
poker all the time was making decent
money so it was a very no-brainer
decision to to take that direction
and

[55:15]
and
yeah i did not have expectations i
didn't think i was gonna ever play 510 i
was like you know if i make it a 2-4 i'm
happy that's where i was aiming for
well when i was playing um
and and you know even when

[55:31]
and and you know even when
i remember one of the first times i
played 2550
uh i stacked off with someone in a three
and a four bet pot
i had kings he had trips with some hand
he should have folded preflop

[55:45]
he should have folded preflop
like twelve thousand dollar pot and you
guys know how online it's like twelve
thousand dollars but the software
doesn't care it's like okay turn card
river card next hand right everything's
super fast even though it's it's
dramatic for you
and i hit the king on the river scoop

[56:01]
and i hit the king on the river scoop
the twelve thousand dollar pot
and i i was so shocked by that i i quit
the table i didn't touch five candles
for a year i was like this is too much
swings for me i can't take it
um
so that's kind of uh yeah my

[56:15]
so that's kind of uh yeah my
expectations were
i i did not expect to do one and no not
this well in poker yeah yeah it's so
interesting for your generation because
you're obviously elite gamer so now
anyone who's 13 to 16 who plays games

[56:30]
anyone who's 13 to 16 who plays games
competitively knows they can make a
living in many many games whereas for
you that path wasn't in your horizon it
wasn't possible yet at that time so you
get into poker with a great skill set of
being a gamer you didn't realize you
could monetize that so when did that
start to change so when you're you went

[56:46]
start to change so when you're you went
into pocket obviously you've graduated
from university you you're living with
friends who are playing poker when did
you like i start to light up and start i
think wait a second
actually this could be a really clear
path because you said you're making
money on the side
when did you really start to see the
potential of your career

[57:02]
potential of your career
um
so so basically like i said i quit
programming we had the the big big 2
500 score split between two people
i know that that sounds funny by today's
standards for a lot of people but you

[57:16]
standards for a lot of people but you
know all depends how much money you have
in a bank i think and
and you have to realize like the the the
magic world championship first place is
forty thousand dollars not ten million
dollars like focus that's a very
different world in terms of uh

[57:32]
different world in terms of uh
of how much money you can make uh i
think
like even the best magic players in the
world would always move on to some
serious profession at some point so the
game was
not nearly as competitive as poker is

[57:47]
not nearly as competitive as poker is
um
and yeah sorry i'm i'm losing track of
the question i'm sidetracking myself too
much you were saying when did uh
when did you start to realize how much
potential poker had as a long-term
career path and when were you uh because

[58:00]
career path and when were you uh because
you were in this mode of seeing a
hundred dollars a day it would be a
great amount for me when are you
starting in set your size higher and
having more success in pokemon
so yeah i think my first year in poker
uh i me and three friends were all we

[58:15]
uh i me and three friends were all we
all know each other from for years for
magic the gathering we moved in together
into a flat in jerusalem
and one of the guys there was already
fairly successful in poker uh he was a
partly with omaha player
and and we all like he coached us a

[58:32]
and and we all like he coached us a
decent bit we were all fairly clueless
um
and and yeah i think i fairly quickly
saw that i i was able to make money and
i must have made i know maybe 50 000

[58:45]
i must have made i know maybe 50 000
in that first year
uh which
you know in in terms of how much money
that is fifty thousand dollars at that
time
uh is
similar to what i would have made as a
full-time programmer working that year

[59:00]
full-time programmer working that year
and i was doing this as i was studying
uh for psychology
then second year
you know i was uh
i i started coaching a little bit for
like i coached someone for fifty dollars

[59:15]
like i coached someone for fifty dollars
an hour and fifty dollars an hour is a
lot of money in the real world when when
you're a college student that's an
insane amount of money fifty dollars an
hour i know this varies country to
country but but like all these things
they were all uh super huge for me

[59:31]
they were all uh super huge for me
uh
so
yeah i think i
like with it within a year or two it was
clear that i i was able to make a
reasonable living playing poker that it
was definitely an
option um and and like i said when

[59:47]
option um and and like i said when
you're when you're thinking like three
thousand dollars a month is like one
thousand to pay the rent and then i have
two thousand for everything else or i
think rent is even less than one
thousand back then
not not aiming too high not spending too

[1:00:02]
not not aiming too high not spending too
much money um
yet i think it was fairly fast fairly
fast i think within
like i said within two years i finished
my studies and i i was like okay i'm

[1:00:15]
my studies and i i was like okay i'm
just doing poker full-time
so you described yourself as someone
who's quite risk-averse and you hate
losing more than you like winning did
that
was any obstacles you ran into with that
kind of mindset going into poker or in
your first few years did you run into
any big down swings or any financial or

[1:00:32]
any big down swings or any financial or
losing periods where
maybe it was hard to deal with
uh well black friday was hard to deal
with if i don't know if you guys were
playing back then but black friday kind
of uh

[1:00:45]
of uh
annihilated most of my bankroll at the
time
and that took me a few months mentally
to recover from and start playing well
again
um i have never really had big down
swings as i was playing i think because

[1:01:00]
swings as i was playing i think because
of lucky
what happened it's tough to say if it's
hurt me or not i i moved up stakes
really really slowly
like you you can imagine i'm winning 10
bb per 100 at 50 nl i'm probably
by far the best player there and i i'm

[1:01:15]
by far the best player there and i i'm
i'm not interested in moving up like i'm
scared to move up to take risks
and i remember first time i played nl600
i lost four buy-ins in one session and
then i moved down for one month to nl
100 to grind the four bands back like

[1:01:31]
100 to grind the four bands back like
that it's the mentality i had
um so everything was just super slow uh
you know personally in my experience the
the downswings were tough
i don't think i like being honest i

[1:01:45]
i don't think i like being honest i
never had a big one i don't know if i
had even a 30 down swing
in my entire career
um
but uh like that a 20 by a down swing
for me might feel like a 60 by a down
swing for someone else given my mental

[1:02:01]
swing for someone else given my mental
state so i was just
yeah just trying to protect myself from
that and like i said when when you're
not aiming too high you don't have to
push yourself too hard
so that that probably helped as well
yeah it sounds like you had some

[1:02:16]
yeah it sounds like you had some
protection mechanisms in play one having
a high win rate at your game being one
of the best players moving up very
slowly so you're probably way way ready
to move upstairs earlier but to mitigate
a lot of the risk and that's obviously
allowed you to go through your career

[1:02:31]
allowed you to go through your career
especially early career without many of
the swings that many players will be
experiencing so yeah almost like that
fear a risk of that risk aversion led
you to make a create a safety first path
where you were going to uh capital all
the downsides obviously happened from

[1:02:45]
the downsides obviously happened from
the upside as well but allowed you to uh
yeah kind of move and move quite
smoothly through your your poke career
so in terms of some skills you develop
through gaming what are some of the
skills you feel like have been helpful
for you as a poker player we know we've
got this kind of strategy thinker who's
able to almost like think of their

[1:03:01]
able to almost like think of their
opponent's ranges or some other skills
that being a gamer has helped you
develop which transitioned well into
poker
um so i think the biggest one
for magic the gathering and in a way
from chess

[1:03:15]
from chess
is that these are games like i said
which the rand i i'm not sure i said
this but the randomness element is
different than in poker
um the games actually play a lot slower
like one game can be 20 30 minutes
rather than one hand which you know can

[1:03:31]
rather than one hand which you know can
be 30 60 seconds
uh you're not multi-tabling if
everything is being done live so
everything's so much slower
and
this caused me to think
to look for all the tiniest edges in

[1:03:45]
to look for all the tiniest edges in
every single decision
because you have time to think about it
and the times that you make a tiny
mistake and you end up losing it can
haunt you for a long time
there's no like five tables in the
background that you're multi-tabling and
everything's moving fast

[1:04:01]
everything's moving fast
like i remember one time i was in new
york playing in a tournament
and i we had like a 50-minute game
and i i made like in the first four
minutes like a tiny tiny mistake and
that was a difference winning or losing

[1:04:15]
that was a difference winning or losing
the game and that game knocked me out of
the tournament in retrospect
so when when you play poker like when i
play poker and there is two big blinds
and a five-way lymph node on the river
i'm taking it super seriously like
there's no

[1:04:31]
there's no
there's very little autopiloting in my
game in any decision
i think i'm a lot better at
small parts than most people as a result
of my gaming background like i'm not i'm
not in it for the big pots i'm playing

[1:04:46]
not in it for the big pots i'm playing
every single hand every single decision
i'm thinking through as much as i can
um
[Music]
and i think
uh
yeah maybe the strategy building aspect
from you know having so much experience

[1:05:02]
from you know having so much experience
in so many different forms of games and
formulating strategies
especially before there were songbirds
uh
kind of helps you
to to think and kind not not be too
scared of of trying stuff out maybe i

[1:05:17]
scared of of trying stuff out maybe i
don't know
yeah so that ability to go deep very
very deep in the sort of nuances of
decisions from gaming where you had more
time and
small decisions it sounded like had a
big compounding effect so that almost

[1:05:30]
big compounding effect so that almost
trained you to be very deliberate in
every decision you make so you have very
little autopilot in and you yeah it
sounds like you go very very deep with
your decisions always i'm guessing that
has some negative effects would you say
you uh maybe that ties you out quicker
would you say you're someone who needs

[1:05:45]
would you say you're someone who needs
more breaks in their sessions as a
byproduct of that
yeah for sure for sure if if we think
about mental fatigue which you know
definitely happens more to me these day
these days when i'm older i'm getting
less sleep and there's more more stuff

[1:06:00]
less sleep and there's more more stuff
going on
um
yeah you know if if i could
get to the flop randomized 60 c bet with
some hand and just move on that would be
easier than getting to the flop and
you know there's a lot more going on for

[1:06:15]
you know there's a lot more going on for
me before each decision
um
so yeah there is you know but i think in
a way this is part of like why i'm
passionate about poker why i still enjoy
poker
it's never been a grind for me in my

[1:06:30]
it's never been a grind for me in my
life like i love playing poker if if
it's the kind of job where you know if
it's nine in the evening i'm super tired
i want to do something for fun i would
play poker
um like
even after all these years i think that

[1:06:45]
even after all these years i think that
keeping an open mind and not automating
your decisions makes it less of a grind
and then my eyes
who kind of from the the career
counseling background
i think that is you know that that's
worth more than money that if you're

[1:07:01]
worth more than money that if you're
able to enjoy the game you're not
automating everything you don't find it
boring like if you find poker boring
uh i i'm not sure that it's the right
game for you like you
i i would rather make less money you

[1:07:16]
i i would rather make less money you
know playing the guitar
and make more money and have be it
boring play and that's one of the the
lucky things about about poker one of
the amazing things you get
that
there are a lot of fields where

[1:07:31]
there are a lot of fields where
you can be very passionate about it and
very talented but you will not make much
money
and people people live with that like i
i know people who make art
and they need to have jobs on the side
and you know that they have to to be

[1:07:46]
and you know that they have to to be
careful with their savings and we as
poker players are
like this is like an alternate universe
compared to a lot of professions in
terms of the the earning potential that
you have for being good at this game
that's very true yeah your passion and

[1:08:01]
that's very true yeah your passion and
your career can be the same thing and
yeah i think it's a really good advice
like for players as well if they're not
feeling that passion for poker they're
not excited about it they find the game
boring you're probably in the wrong
domain you need to find something else
that lights you up because poker should

[1:08:15]
that lights you up because poker should
be fun it should be this really exciting
game and if you're trying to fake that
or i spoke a lot of players who've kind
of been hinting on the fact that they're
not enjoying the game and they think the
solution is more discipline more
willpower force themselves to play more
hours in reality it's like this this not

[1:08:30]
hours in reality it's like this this not
connected with the game they've lost
that passion either rekindle that
passion and remember why you're playing
this game and what an amazing
opportunity it is or you've got a long
life go find something else that does
light you up that is fun that you've got
like you said that kind of career choice
one third of your life is often spent on

[1:08:45]
one third of your life is often spent on
our work life so make it fun make it
passionate make it something that you
enjoy and the poker does take that box
amazing now your passion and your work
career can be the same thing which is
very unique obviously i think maybe
sports people have this maybe very
talented artists like musicians and

[1:09:00]
talented artists like musicians and
stuff would have this their creativity
and their passion becomes their career
but there's not many people it must be
on a small spectrum of people who can
link their passions and their careers
and most like you said we'll have to
have supplement income when they have
something to do for fun they have to
make money elsewhere which takes a lot

[1:09:16]
make money elsewhere which takes a lot
of time and energy so yeah it's a
definite privilege to be a be a poker
player
so for yourself you managed to i
mentioned your psychology backgrounds
how did that impact your pocket career
and for you like what are some of the
things that yeah the kind of things you
transition from learn about psychology

[1:09:31]
transition from learn about psychology
into being a poker player
um it's funny that actually i think the
thing that most impacted my career as a
poker player in my psychology study were
the statistics courses that we took in

[1:09:45]
the statistics courses that we took in
psychology
because uh
yeah we talk about uh
psychological studies talk about sample
sizes and they talk about variants
and they talk about uh how to handle

[1:10:00]
and they talk about uh how to handle
large amounts of numbers
um
and a lot of these things are very
relevant to poker uh
the rest like i said i i didn't practice
as a psychologist in any way the the
psychology ba in university is mostly

[1:10:15]
psychology ba in university is mostly
research oriented so i can't say that
like learning about the various proteins
in the human brain is very relevant to
playing poker
neither is learning about various mental
disorders even though you know it's
relevant to life and certainly

[1:10:33]
relevant to life and certainly
i have known players and they have
mental disorders and i know which thanks
to my psychology background but
at the tables and in terms of playing um

[1:10:45]
at the tables and in terms of playing um
i like it it would be nice to say
psychology is relevant but that that's
not what you end up studying in
university you study a lot more dry
academic research oriented at least
where i come from yeah that's
interesting that the statistics module

[1:11:00]
interesting that the statistics module
which is probably the most boring worst
module for most of the psychology uh
course and you found that very
interesting and it was same for me
actually i did sports science and sport
science especially degree level is a lot
about research and where the latest kind

[1:11:15]
about research and where the latest kind
of yeah research is taking performance
and you learn a lot about data again
sample sizes how the studies have been
shown to uh show this performance
variable in this particular sport yeah i
find that really fascinating as well in
terms of you know how to uh how to use
data to find a kind of narrative or to

[1:11:32]
data to find a kind of narrative or to
support a hypothesis or a disproven
hypothesis through yeah kind of studies
and research so yeah i can relate to
that one as well
so yourself from what i'm getting from
you so far we've got this risk-averse
kind of personality we've got this kind
of linear progress where you're having

[1:11:46]
of linear progress where you're having
big win rates at your games and then
moving up when the time's right not
taking on too much risk and almost wait
until you're almost sure that you can
crush that level was there any uh
roadblocks you had in your career or
were you quite smooth all the way was
any i wasn't any defining moment where

[1:12:01]
any i wasn't any defining moment where
you're like ah that was a big jump for
me big jump where i really made a step
up in my either stakes i was playing or
a big break through my career
i would say in in terms of roadblocks i
i never felt felt like i was hitting her

[1:12:16]
i never felt felt like i was hitting her
old roadblock other than black friday
black friday for me was
like led to six months of breaking even
when i needed the money more and i was
more frustrated it was playing bad and
not really know what to do about it

[1:12:30]
not really know what to do about it
and in terms of uh
things that helped me
one of the things that helped me a lot
at the start of my career uh was
funny because because we were talking i
i probably before the podcast we were

[1:12:46]
i probably before the podcast we were
talking about how
like in the world of poker kind of being
nice and sharing freely with people
often has has big benefits
so i was in a skype study group
and um

[1:13:03]
i was in a skype study group and we we
were just kind of talking freely about
lots of things
and uh one of the guys uh referenced me
uh
a post from a forum where there was a

[1:13:16]
a post from a forum where there was a
really good player who want a poker
player who wanted to learn magic the
gathering
and he posted like i'm looking for a
magic the gathering coach i'm willing to
trade poker coaching for magic the
gathering coaching and this guy was
charging like 300 euro an hour i'm a 50

[1:13:31]
charging like 300 euro an hour i'm a 50
nl player
um so i i messaged him and you can
imagine his reaction he's like wow the
magic the gathering world championship
man magic the gathering world champion
is going to coach me he's super happy
i'm thinking like this guy's gonna coach

[1:13:45]
i'm thinking like this guy's gonna coach
me
uh so i i learned that this guy is his
nickname online was grindcore i don't
know if you know if you've heard of him
yeah he's dutch kind of an old-school
guy
uh yeah he's dutch he's done yeah

[1:14:01]
uh yeah he's dutch he's done yeah
so i i worked with him a decent amount
at that point and through the years and
he was many levels ahead of me and
definitely kind of opened my mind where
you know i had a naturally exploitative
approach

[1:14:16]
approach
but he was a lot
better at it than i was and and
definitely taught me a lot of things
about that throughout the years
so i think that that had a fairly big
effect
and and generally just networking just

[1:14:30]
and and generally just networking just
this network of friends that that i i
had at the start and had throughout my
career was constantly a huge benefit
for me where all the time opportunities
would come up
because of someone who had been friends
with a year before

[1:14:46]
with a year before
um
can i i can't say like how much those
kind of things have helped me throughout
the years at various points
whether it's been
someone recommending a site or

[1:15:00]
someone recommending a site or
uh
you know connecting me with someone else
or talking to someone about strategy
i think in poker
definitely the the gto approach off the
table is just not to worry about sharing

[1:15:15]
table is just not to worry about sharing
information and being nice to people and
just kind of be
be open be friendly be honest and it's
such a huge world like you don't need to
worry about i'm gonna sit at the same
table with this guy
i can't tell him this huge secret like

[1:15:30]
i can't tell him this huge secret like
the benefits far outweigh the
disadvantages so i i think
that's kind of been a silent boost
throughout my career in a variety of
stages but
overall it it was pretty smooth sailing
for me kind of other than black friday i

[1:15:47]
for me kind of other than black friday i
was kind of moving up at my own pace
every stake i moved up i i tended to
have a similar win rate to the stake
before
um
but because like i said i was moving up
way way way too slowly

[1:16:00]
way way way too slowly
so the it's not like the the guys at the
next level were much better than me at
the point where i moved up there i was
probably better than the next stake by
the time i was there
so
everything kind of kind of smooth chill

[1:16:15]
everything kind of kind of smooth chill
uh at least that's my memory i don't
know if i'm blocking stuff out because
like i said
emotionally it was a roller coaster but
but overall it was very linear progress
i think yeah and it sounds like the way
you've almost planned your career i'm
not sure if this was a conscious plan

[1:16:31]
not sure if this was a conscious plan
from day one but you've took you've
taken less risk like you said moving up
very slowly relative to your skill level
with that approach you're going to
experience a lot less
variance on kind of ups and downs
compared to most players it sounds like
for your mindset your personality type

[1:16:46]
for your mindset your personality type
that was what it was a good approach and
even though it might might look linear
as we tell the story i'm guessing for
you there was ups and downs and huge um
moments of doubt like in the short term
which might might not be front of mind
right now but i think it's interesting
to know
your tolerance for risk i think i'm

[1:17:01]
your tolerance for risk i think i'm
fascinated by that topic because i think
the advice often gets given quite
broadly like how much risk to take on
but you've really got to know yourself
very well and some players making them
take a lot of risk is a really really
bad idea like the the knock-on effects
and the potential bad scenarios are way

[1:17:16]
and the potential bad scenarios are way
way too too big so i haven't worked with
a lot of stables in the past i know
often one of the mistakes i see stables
make is they push players to take on a
lot of risk because they're like don't
worry we'll cover the downside it's no
big deal but the player himself all of a

[1:17:30]
big deal but the player himself all of a
sudden he's going
hugely down and he can't deal with it
mentally but from the stables
perspective it's like oh just grind out
of makeup it's no big deal but he's just
took on 20k of makeup in the cause of a
series and now he's he's really doubted
everything about poca his life and the

[1:17:45]
everything about poca his life and the
whole his whole um world models came
apart because he wasn't ready to take on
that risk so uh yeah i think sometimes
just knowing are you the person who
responds well to risk i'm kind of i in
my life i've generally done well with
risk but i know my tolerance i know what
i'm taking on too much and on the flip

[1:18:00]
i'm taking on too much and on the flip
side i've got lots of friends who are
very risk-averse and they'll make
similar decisions to you will just not
take not put themselves in positions to
experience any variance so yeah i think
it's it's the self-awareness to noah
which is going to be a good fit for you
yeah i found it really interesting what
you're saying about your network and it

[1:18:15]
you're saying about your network and it
sounds like for you you've been a very
given person throughout your career a
nice guy who's been very authentic and
you've been want to share knowledge and
share your advice and as a result of
that you've attracted the right type of
people and so yeah i think that's a
another thing like in the poker world i

[1:18:30]
another thing like in the poker world i
think often players well we have two
camps one will share freely others will
be quite secretive and yeah i think i
agree with you and i think ren is the
same mindset of giving freely in a way
to uh build connections to help other
people will often pay back infinitely
amounts compared to uh the short-term ev

[1:18:46]
amounts compared to uh the short-term ev
loss of maybe sharing a strategy so um
yeah i found it interesting we had very
quite a lot of guests on our show so far
and a few of them mentioned you as
almost like a
strategist they cast you as someone who
was able to think outside the box in
ways that other players can't would you

[1:19:01]
ways that other players can't would you
say that was a strength of yours your
ability to uh yeah i think outside the
box and why do you think other players
would classify you as a good outside the
box thinker
um
yeah i
i think thinking outside the box like i

[1:19:17]
i think thinking outside the box like i
said throughout all the strategy games
i've played that's always been a big
strength of mine um
[Music]
both both computer games magic the
gathering like i said you have
thousands of different cards that you're

[1:19:30]
thousands of different cards that you're
making strategies from and very often
like i would come up with a strategy no
one had thought of and then it would win
the australian championship and the us
championship and everyone was playing
with the cards that i'd kind of put
together in the first place so

[1:19:45]
together in the first place so
i i think again this this is my biggest
skill in poker is is putting together
strategies more like more than i am a
strong player i think i'm a reasonably
but
there are definitely people i know and

[1:20:01]
there are definitely people i know and
people who have coached who as far as
like if we're sitting at the table their
brain is you know it has a higher cpu
than mine
uh and i i had the same in magic the
gathering where i was the best player in
israel for a while

[1:20:16]
israel for a while
and i had a friend come along uh
young guy and it was super clear
i'll give you guys an example so imagine
there are 20 cars on the board
and you have to come up with a good game
plan
so most guys they would stare at the 20

[1:20:31]
so most guys they would stare at the 20
cards that just get confused
like they would not be able to hold all
the information in their brain
and that makes some huge punt even very
good players and i was able to look at
the 20 cards
think for like 30 seconds trying to

[1:20:45]
think for like 30 seconds trying to
calculate and then make a reasonable
play
and this guy would look at the cards for
half a second and he'd make the best
play so this is like the the caliber of
processor in your brain
but he had no ability to come up with
strategies

[1:21:01]
strategies
he like that there are
so i think for me
um
like that this has always been my big
strength uh throughout my life is to
think about
the big picture know what information is

[1:21:16]
the big picture know what information is
important and what is less important you
know when we're working with poker with
solvers like renee was saying about that
sizing frequency
there is so much information
uh when you work with these tools

[1:21:31]
uh when you work with these tools
that if you're just going even with a
very
fast processor if you just go over
everything it's never gonna end
and i'm very good at kind of navigating
through the like i don't care about this
i don't care about that this is really

[1:21:45]
i don't care about that this is really
interesting
if i get stuck i'm very easily moving on
um
so i think this is this is like my
my talent in poker more so than anything
else

[1:22:01]
this podcast is brought to you by poker
ambition where me and adam have created
our coaching program the mechanics of
poker after having reached highsex poker
ourselves we tested out this philosophy
on our cfp students which saw them rise

[1:22:17]
on our cfp students which saw them rise
through the ranks and doubled their win
rate we then took the best knowledge of
that cfp program and turn it into the
mechanics of poker so you can have that
high quality content without the

[1:22:30]
high quality content without the
long-term commitment and often hefty
price that comes with a cfp program now
i will be teaching you the technical
side of how poker really works how to
think about the game and how to
consistently get better and adam focuses
on the mindset and performance skills

[1:22:46]
on the mindset and performance skills
you need to know in order to convert all
that technical poker knowledge into more
consistent profits at the table now this
program is high level it's made for
professional poker players who have the
ambition to break free from mid stakes

[1:23:00]
ambition to break free from mid stakes
and move up to high stakes poker so if
you're ambitious about your poker goals
go over to pokerambition.com
for more information and there you can
also find a free one-hour demo of
everything that is inside the program if

[1:23:16]
everything that is inside the program if
you have any further questions don't
hesitate to reach out but without
further ado let's get back to more
goodness in this episode the ability to
build strategies so yeah i think we
talked about this concept with a

[1:23:30]
talked about this concept with a
brazilian guest called zinho and he was
talking about having different almost
avatars of poker players we talked about
a logical player who's going to get the
gto guy we talked about the exploit guy
who's very intuitive and then we talked
about an architect an architect who
likes to build stuff and zinho himself

[1:23:46]
likes to build stuff and zinho himself
is someone who likes to build strategies
and you sound like that kind of
architect guy who likes to build out
these really complex strategies and yeah
you've probably spent a lot of time away
from poker i'm guessing that's why
you've wanted to create courses right
now because your skill is to build these
strategies which like i said i i was

[1:24:01]
strategies which like i said i i was
thinking as you were talking if i look
at 20 cards next to each other i'm like
wow like where do you begin to start
making links here so yeah it's
definitely a unique skill set to be able
to come up with strategies uh relative
to that so yeah i can see that why that
was a
good good skill of yours so ready i'm

[1:24:16]
good good skill of yours so ready i'm
sure you've got a bunch of questions on
creating pocket strategies it's very
much in your line of expertise
yeah again we're very very similar in
this matter right this was also actually
one of the reasons i went

[1:24:30]
one of the reasons i went
into poker coaching because what i
always liked about poker was the coming
up with strategy i actually preferred
studying and strategy way more than
actually playing so then i was like hmm
how can i get paid doing what i like so
then we did a cfp it's like so these
guys pay me to study the game and then

[1:24:46]
guys pay me to study the game and then
i'll explain them what to do so it's a
perfect exchange right
and i i know i notice it as well in
other games when we go play other games
and i compare that to
other friends of mine
uh i understand immediately like how

[1:25:01]
uh i understand immediately like how
games work basically a bit faster than
others i'm like this is quite obvious
right you should make this play you
should make this play even in other
games uh so i think that's definitely uh
a skill that has helped me as well um i
wanted to touch on a point that we made

[1:25:16]
wanted to touch on a point that we made
about
brain fatigue
about if you especially if you have
no baseline let's say for example
pre-flop you have you decide preflop
what to race based on the opponents that
are at the table right it's a decision

[1:25:31]
are at the table right it's a decision
that a lot of people already simplified
because they just use a preflop chart
and they might start to think on the
turn and on the river right whereas it
sounds like your style and more
exploitative style when you try to push
all edges already brief up your thinking
a lot on a flop you're thinking a lot so

[1:25:46]
a lot on a flop you're thinking a lot so
the kind of the dark side of that is uh
is that indeed you're kind of captain
how much hours you can make right you
have probably you never been a guy who
grinded a hundred thousand hands in a
month me neither like i would i would
say stuck at 40 40 000 because then my

[1:26:02]
say stuck at 40 40 000 because then my
brain would have you know smoke would
come out of my brain because of the
amount of thinking i do
um what i then suffered with when i
started to realize so i suffered then
from volume right i always had a high
win rate but i couldn't play that much

[1:26:16]
win rate but i couldn't play that much
volume because of the style
and i also noticed because i knew there
was a very big range in my game right in
the beginning we talked about plus 15 or
-10 these were two versions of myself
that could show up i started to suffer
from some pre-session anxieties like

[1:26:32]
from some pre-session anxieties like
which version of myself is going to show
up and i would try i would almost become
a little bit perfectionistic and
everything around me trying to show up
at my best because i knew that that was
the version of myself that would be a
philosophy player and the other version

[1:26:45]
philosophy player and the other version
was not a plus v player did you ever
suffer from
similar anxieties around performing
yes yes for sure i think one of the
toughest things for me when i play poker
is that i'm not sure that i'm a winning

[1:27:01]
is that i'm not sure that i'm a winning
player
which is is a hard thing to say because
clearly overall i'm i'm a winning player
with a high win rate my entire career
but you know this day or this week or
this month i know there is a reasonable

[1:27:16]
this month i know there is a reasonable
chance i'm a losing player um
and that that's a very hard reality to
deal with
uh you know that that you sit down at
the table and you lose money but it's
not just that you lost because of
variance you also lost because

[1:27:32]
variance you also lost because
uh and and not just because of bad play
but you lost because today you are a bad
player you shouldn't have been playing
um so i i think that def like that
dealing with that has definitely been a

[1:27:45]
dealing with that has definitely been a
struggle for me
uh i identify with you like when you're
saying 40 000 hands a month i don't i'm
not sure i had
many months where i even hit 40 000
hands
um i think for me the the area was
mostly more like thirty thousand thirty

[1:28:00]
mostly more like thirty thousand thirty
five thousand a month
no you you play less tables you play
less volume uh it's
it's more emotional like all these
things are very i can very much identify
with with everything you're saying

[1:28:16]
with with everything you're saying
what were then some of the things you
try to do
in in order to make sure that you show
up at your best
um
so i'll start out saying like i said i'm
not proud of this this has been a
neglected area for me for a long time

[1:28:33]
in terms of things that i do these days
where i've put more work into it
you know these days is like the most
crazy for me because i have i have two

[1:28:46]
crazy for me because i have i have two
kids
one of them is still a baby so i get
you know five to six hours sleep at
night interrupted then we get up get the
kid ready for kindergarten
drive him there in traffic jams and

[1:29:00]
drive him there in traffic jams and
everything and get back home it's nine
in the morning and most guys are still
sleeping they're gonna get up go to the
gym whatever start playing i've already
been up for three or four hours i
haven't slept enough and i i need to be
in a in a good mindset for playing poker

[1:29:15]
in a in a good mindset for playing poker
so i'm i'm still kind of figuring it out
just
i think being aware that this is part of
the skill set that i need is a big help
not thinking about
like it's not just about knowing how to
play poker you have to know how to

[1:29:32]
play poker you have to know how to
handle
yourself and your life
how to balance these things together
with poker
kind of treat it like an athlete would
treat things like you can't
have three beers eat a bunch of junk

[1:29:47]
have three beers eat a bunch of junk
food and then go to a basketball game so
when when you play poker
if it's possible with which it isn't
always i i try to have some sort of
separation
so i you know
i will not play poker if i only have an

[1:30:01]
i will not play poker if i only have an
hour and a half and then i have to run
somewhere because my brain is too busy
i i try to kind of finish as many other
tasks that might be distracting me
before sitting down at the table
um
and overall

[1:30:16]
and overall
yeah let me think what what which other
things i'm doing the the breaks i try to
take breaks where i
am you know taking long walks or taking
a nap rather than
going on twitter or playing computer

[1:30:30]
going on twitter or playing computer
games or stuff like that that i used to
do which is probably not the best idea
so kind of trying to
to lessen the load on on my mind to get
to poker
from a place where the rest of my life
is is as in harmony as i can manage

[1:30:45]
is is as in harmony as i can manage
before i sit down to play and and also
i'm constantly aware of
do i want to play
because very often i won't be in like my
life is a bit chaotic sometimes

[1:31:01]
life is a bit chaotic sometimes
but i really really feel like playing i
always think that's kind of a good sign
like where the passion is there and you
really want to play
um you're not not from like a down swing
i really want to win money but but just
i really feel like playing

[1:31:16]
i really feel like playing
so i tried to to pick those kind of
times and just uh
[Music]
yeah i don't kind of treat my work as
everything like part of my work as a
poker player is setting all my financial
affairs in order making sure the house

[1:31:30]
affairs in order making sure the house
is tidy eating properly sleeping
properly exercising like all of these
are part of of playing good poker i
don't think you can really separate them
yeah it's i definitely approached it in
the same way but i think at some point i

[1:31:47]
the same way but i think at some point i
sort of
became almost neurotic like oh i ate a
hamburger yesterday i cannot play the
next day uh so i will just study instead
everything to avoid
trying to show up and not playing my a

[1:32:01]
trying to show up and not playing my a
game and that has personally cost me a
lot of volume and like i said that would
definitely increase the anxiety maybe
also for some for some players who
struggle with this i did a lot of
sessions with jared thandler as well
shout out to jared thandler uh and i
remember he he gave me the vanco yeah

[1:32:16]
remember he he gave me the vanco yeah
you think of it too black and white he
said white in this case is you being a
plus five fifteen bb winner but black he
says you don't even know what the other
side actually is you're afraid that it's
minus 10 bb but you never showed up when
you only had six hours of sleep four

[1:32:30]
you only had six hours of sleep four
hours of sleep so how do you know
and the same if i would come back from a
holiday or something from a break i
would spend like four days studying and
preparing in a way that okay i'm gonna
perform at my best but he actually gave
me the advice which i thought was very
good he said when you come back from a
break

[1:32:45]
break
or from a holiday just sit down and see
what shows up so you get more familiar
with the bottom part of your range like
your c game for example and see that
it's actually not as bad as you might
think
right and that really helped me when i

[1:33:00]
right and that really helped me when i
started to see like ah indeed actually
it's more sort of the anticipation of
how bad my c game is then how bad my c
game actually is
and that has really helped me so maybe
that's a good tip for uh for you as well
and for for for our audience listening

[1:33:16]
and for for for our audience listening
yeah and another thing again that i
think you you can take away from from
working with jared is that
your c game is going to show up
sometimes
and you can try thinking about
like when it shows up
what did i what which kind of mistakes

[1:33:31]
what did i what which kind of mistakes
did i make and the more aware you are of
those
you can study the situations better
because i'm sure even though like
limitless in this c game will raise
seven do solve suit under the gun
um shout out to limitless if you guys

[1:33:46]
um shout out to limitless if you guys
saw that and i'm not i'm sure you you
would not do that even in your d game
and then there's a bunch of things that
even us as very exploitative players
where we're not going that far
and and the more you can improve and

[1:34:00]
and and the more you can improve and
kind of recognize
the types of mistakes that show up
you can uh even try to counter them with
biases
like you were saying like if i know i'm
naturally stationy and it gets worse
when i'm playing bad

[1:34:15]
when i'm playing bad
uh
you you can try to to mitigate the
damage like make this making the sea
game less bad is also
a form of both reducing anxiety getting
familiar with it it lets you increase
your volume like that there's a bunch of

[1:34:31]
your volume like that there's a bunch of
stuff that that can be done there
yeah i think he really helped me see
e-game as an opportunity so you
mentioned grindcore
who had a big influence in your game do
you remember any like aha moments from

[1:34:46]
you remember any like aha moments from
coaching sessions with him
that you might like to share with the
audience maybe they have an aha moment
for themselves as well
um i
like in poker i remember i i had three
aha moments

[1:35:01]
aha moments i had three
one of them was with grindcore one was
before grindcore
and one was with pio solver
um
so if if we start with uh if we go kind
of in chronological order

[1:35:17]
of in chronological order
i think the first one
i was you know i'd started out playing
nl100 when i started with cash games
and
i was in kind of the mode that i i told
you guys i think is a bad frame of mind

[1:35:31]
you guys i think is a bad frame of mind
to be in i i was thinking all the
regulars are really good
i'll focus on a recreational and just
try to avoid them
um
and at some point a bit down the line
i bought

[1:35:46]
i bought
uh
bought into like a 100 buy-in tournament
which was very big for my bankroll at
the time
and when i was playing there and i was
playing against a regular something
clicked in my mind where
i felt like

[1:36:02]
i had enough experience to know how he
would perceive what i'm doing
does that make sense
[Music]
and and then at that point i started
bluffing the hell out of all the

[1:36:15]
bluffing the hell out of all the
regulars in a bunch of very believable
lines that nobody ever bluffed my
redline shot up and
that was kind of my my first moment
where i was like uh
you know if i triple barrel this spot
this guy's going to be sure i have

[1:36:30]
this guy's going to be sure i have
something strong
uh so i i just look not look at my cards
and just blast off for a long time just
fun times yeah you became very good at
storytelling and i like to think of
poker in a way
we're telling stories and we're trying

[1:36:46]
we're telling stories and we're trying
to tell as convincing story to the other
person so he believes us and vice versa
as well we're always trying to think
what story is my opponent telling and
does this story check out which is ways
of thinking about the game that i think
sort of post solver era guys kind of

[1:37:02]
sort of post solver era guys kind of
stopped doing because they're constantly
thinking about what does my range have
to do i'm like come on think about what
what your opponent has right that's a
that's a question that is nowadays often
forgotten i think it's a it's a shame
it's a shame actually

[1:37:16]
it's a shame actually
uh yeah
there are some spots where you can tell
such a believable story that your
opponent will just fold his entire range
you know there used to be more than they
are now because if you play against the
solar guy he will rng some number even

[1:37:31]
solar guy he will rng some number even
if he can't imagine what you're bluffing
with
yeah it's so tilting i i i almost feel
like it's disrespective to the great
story that i told that he didn't make
the hero fault
yes yes yes for sure for sure i i

[1:37:46]
yes yes yes for sure for sure i i
remember one time where i ran this huge
bluff in a spot nobody's ever bluffing
on a board i think the board was like
ace king
uh
and some three bet pot or four bat pot
and i i like

[1:38:00]
and i i like
shoved 200 big blinds over the guys
river bet where obviously i have some
kind of boat or quads or something he
just snap called with a six high flush i
was super tilted
uh because he's not paying attention to
my story i don't mind if you call but if

[1:38:15]
my story i don't mind if you call but if
you snap call that's very disrespectful
to the story it's like he's not even
listening to me
um
so so yeah i think storytelling is a
really nice way to frame that
so so i kind of got aware of the
storytelling aspect of the game i think

[1:38:32]
storytelling aspect of the game i think
that was my first moment
where i was like you know one once you
start to follow the story
you can lie convincingly and you can
spot other people's lives better and and
you can start

[1:38:45]
you can start
especially at low and mid stakes like
that is often enough to just be a huge
winner with those takes
now in in terms of grind core
the moment i had with grindcore was

[1:39:01]
the moment i had with grindcore was
actually a super powerful one and and
you have to remember this was years and
years ago
and back then everyone would always see
that like like that was how you started
the hand you see that
and he he was sweating me in a coaching

[1:39:16]
and he he was sweating me in a coaching
session
and i got some board and i went to see
that and and grindcore told me you know
you don't have to see that
and my brain exploded i was like wow
so many possibilities if i don't have to

[1:39:31]
so many possibilities if i don't have to
see that and he was like you know let's
think what's gonna happen if you check
back
and and you know the the possibilities
are endless once you're not in a box of
that you have to do something
uh ver

[1:39:45]
uh ver
and i think he really opened my mind in
a bunch of ways to
to note-taking in general but also just
to the fact that i don't have to play
sports like a robot
there's absolutely nothing that i have
to do and i don't have to three that ace

[1:40:01]
to do and i don't have to three that ace
king i don't have to see that with my
over pair i can do whatever i want as
long as i have good reasons for it so
that that was the the moment with
grindcore
and the the moment with po solver

[1:40:17]
and the the moment with po solver
uh po solver was a program that i
hesitated getting because i'm not
naturally a computer program kind of guy
i might give off the wrong impression
i'm not very tech savvy

[1:40:30]
i'm not very tech savvy
so when i saw there is a program with
all these complicated outputs i did not
really want to change my game everything
was going well i wasn't attracted to it
but when i finally decided to get it uh
you know pure solver when it came out we

[1:40:45]
you know pure solver when it came out we
didn't have pre-flop ranges even like
you you didn't have gto pre-flop ranges
at the start so you had to input
everything
and then
it it came up with really weird
strategies for someone who's who had

[1:41:00]
strategies for someone who's who had
been playing for years before and doing
well
pio solver was doing some some really
strange things some some some weird [ __ ]
going on
and i i looked at it and i was like you
know this makes no sense this is a
terrible way to play

[1:41:15]
terrible way to play
uh so i note locked the way that i would
play
i ran the note long
i saw how pure solver would crush me
and that was my my third moment i think
in my career like understanding

[1:41:30]
all the holes that had been in my
strategy that nobody had ever seen and
kind of
you know rather than using this to think
oh i have to play po solver strategy now
so people can't exploit me
i was thinking you know

[1:41:45]
i was thinking you know
this is a really good exploit against
half the people i'm playing against so
so i'm gonna do that
that's a that's a very big one i'm
usually a very big
advocate as well as when you study
solver it's mainly important to study

[1:42:00]
solver it's mainly important to study
the aggressor spots right because we
want to i think you mentioned this in
the beginning as well you want to kind
of know what kind of ranges are playing
what what things people are doing and
then think about how would a human being
interpret what the solver is doing and

[1:42:15]
interpret what the solver is doing and
then execute it and that's kind of what
you're then describing because
then then you will see the corrections
like okay how can i then counter if if
the initial razor should do this because
of that well he's probably not doing
that because a human interpretation of
the solver is doing different then what

[1:42:30]
the solver is doing different then what
does the counter exploit to what humans
are basically doing and then you're
basically found a way to exploit
human implications of gto
uh exactly exactly and very often it's
actually easier to play against someone
who's using a solver than someone who

[1:42:46]
who's using a solver than someone who
isn't because you know
how he's going to perceive spots how
he's thinking about them and if you're
studying in this way
i'm all the time thinking all types of
mistakes people who follow the solver
are going to make like you said they

[1:43:00]
are going to make like you said they
will bluff the river at 50 frequency
because they know that's the frequency
but what are they doing on the flop
what are they doing on the turn
and then you know you can kind of
understand
are they over bluffing are they under
bluffing what is likely going on in each

[1:43:16]
bluffing what is likely going on in each
situation
yeah i think a good example of that is
in in the past when i would play against
linus and otb linus was
you know trying to play closer to gto i
remember very limited in sizings that he

[1:43:30]
remember very limited in sizings that he
used but very good in the frequencies
for the sizing that he picked
but in a way so he was very good but you
always kind of knew what to expect
whereas when you would play against otb
it's like o2b could throw out
anything at any random given moment so

[1:43:45]
anything at any random given moment so
on one on one way obviously they were
both hard to play against but on one way
i thought the otb was always like oh
what the [ __ ] is he gonna do now you
always had to be very sharp and on your
toes right
i thought that that was
harder sort of to play against than if
someone at least stays in a predictable

[1:44:01]
someone at least stays in a predictable
uh in a predictable game tree
you know one one of the the moments i
was most proud of in my poker career
uh again years and years ago i was
playing zoom 500 and i stole otd's
victim and i i was super pumped that i

[1:44:17]
victim and i i was super pumped that i
managed to steal his zipline
yeah he's he's a legendary player i i
remember talking to high stakes guys
and
a friend told me about otb he said
he's impossible to play against he has a

[1:44:31]
he's impossible to play against he has a
million sizings in every spot and
they're all perfectly balanced and
you're just helpless
like that that was the the feeling of
terror that he inspired in people for
sure
and the the funny thing is
this is something i thought about

[1:44:46]
this is something i thought about
earlier that this week as well
is that you know it if i were playing
with someone as good as otb
i would probably try to stay out of his
way a bit because you know you don't
want the pain of him beating you up

[1:45:00]
want the pain of him beating you up
and uh the way six max works is if i
stay out of his way then his win rate
goes up that's good for him
even if he has an edge against me you
know if if i i v pip less when he's in
the hand
um that that's good for his win rate so

[1:45:17]
um that that's good for his win rate so
i think by being so intimidating like
linus and otb they are gaining kind of
win rate bonuses just by being people
avoiding them i think that there's a
decent chance that's going on and
really interesting to hear about linus i

[1:45:31]
really interesting to hear about linus i
i have not played with him very much so
i don't know
how gto he plays
i i know i've seen several hands where
he was certainly not playing gtl at
least pre-flop
so i i i was never sure

[1:45:45]
so i i i was never sure
either one of them like how exactly they
were playing other than that they were
obviously
very good and that it was clear that
they understood gto much better than
than everyone else around them i think
that's always been been clear when you
study hand histories

[1:46:01]
study hand histories
that otb you know he had a solver before
po solver was out i think that's fairly
clear
linus
has studied with the solver very very
well and he knows gto a lot better than

[1:46:15]
well and he knows gto a lot better than
everyone around him at high stakes
that's also fairly clear
but yeah i'd be interested in hearing
any stories you have about either of
them i i love hearing lioness and otd
stories
uh i think i think i've told this story
before but the nicest story i always

[1:46:30]
before but the nicest story i always
have by linus when he was trying to move
up is
when we would play a three or four
handed game at let's say 1k or or 2k and
then when the when the table would fill
with a fish he would snap leaf and start
a new three-handed game that's always my

[1:46:45]
a new three-handed game that's always my
best story about linus he was like [ __ ]
fish leaf at the battle rex again that's
that's by far my best story about lights
and like i said with otb it's just
yeah it's it's sort of the fear of that
you never knew what to anticipate what i

[1:47:00]
you never knew what to anticipate what i
remember from from linus as well is that
he was very good at throwing his
stacking he would oh like he wasn't that
creative with the sizing that he picked
but he definitely knew when to when to
shove his stack in somehow always when i
played a hand against linus it would end
up with him jamming his stack in the

[1:47:15]
up with him jamming his stack in the
middle of the river and me being like
[ __ ] my life i remember there was also a
takeaway i did then also took up on your
advice i would try to avoid playing
against linus or otb
uh that was in general guys this is the
general this is just good advice uh also

[1:47:32]
general this is just good advice uh also
in terms of
uh i i
listened a little bit to your uh
conversation with uh doc polk and we
were talking about rta and stuff and i
also always always say this like listen
if you have a very if you have a guy

[1:47:45]
if you have a very if you have a guy
who's crushing and who's playing very
good he's either very good
or he's cheating and both ways i don't
want to play with that guy so i will try
to avoid him uh and also in terms of
avoiding i think this is also
very good advice
uh and something that can sometimes tell

[1:48:00]
uh and something that can sometimes tell
me if you look at for example people
following pre-flop ranges let's say
you're in the big blind and you have
your preflop defend chart okay
well
the range that you are allowed to play
is based on you know the opening sizing
the odds etc but a very important factor
is your equity realization right how

[1:48:16]
is your equity realization right how
much does your opponent allow you how
much of your equity does your opponent's
strategy allow you to realize
uh and also i have something that i call
my bluff ability so how effective can i
bluff against this guy
so if i would then play against otp it

[1:48:31]
so if i would then play against otp it
was very aggressive same as linus
they're very aggressive and they didn't
like the fault
then if i have my [ __ ] six five off
suits in the big blind
and it's quite close
then you have to understand that versus
oh to be a lioness it's probably gonna

[1:48:45]
oh to be a lioness it's probably gonna
lose you money right
and i think these are ways that
people
who follow just solvers they don't take
in consideration
the skill of execution i would say
right that if we're not we're not that

[1:49:01]
right that if we're not we're not that
we're not
we're human i'm not going to be able to
play that hand profitably versus a
player like otb and linus
uh yeah i i i agree 100
like if you are worse than the guy
you're playing against or even if you're
not worse and he's just

[1:49:16]
not worse and he's just
like a good aggressive player right like
if someone is a good aggressive player
even if you are at his level
this is going to make parts of your
range underperform
and other parts over perform and and
it's good to account for that and be

[1:49:31]
it's good to account for that and be
aware of that as much as you can
and
you know pre-flop ranges and gto
strategies
um
are definitely
not the bible in in poker they are

[1:49:47]
not the bible in in poker they are
they're a reference point for a toy game
like gto is not is not reality
uh you know a bluff is mixed on the turn
if you execute it correctly on the river
if you're gonna chicken out on the river
you shouldn't mix the turn because some

[1:50:01]
you shouldn't mix the turn because some
of the river spots are plasticv you're
missing those
it's game over
like you have to to think things all the
way through and
[Music]
yeah i think like you were saying in the
beginning people who focus a lot on flop

[1:50:15]
beginning people who focus a lot on flop
sizes and flop frequencies are
completely missing the fact
that they're going to butcher the turn
in the river so the flop frequency is
completely meaningless you know
taking that into consideration like if i
wanted to to teach someone how to play

[1:50:30]
wanted to to teach someone how to play
you start with learning how to play the
river you then go to play to learn how
to play the turn and flop is like the
least important street
there it's very difficult to make a flop
mistake
and like an eevee mistake on the flop
almost anything you do is okay

[1:50:46]
almost anything you do is okay
with almost any hand on the flop
on the river it's super easy to make a
mistake on the turn it's fairly easy to
make a mistake flop is like the least
important street to study
and i feel like

[1:51:00]
and i feel like
you know for people who are very
organized and very linear you know like
you're used to studying in school you go
first grade second grade third grade so
you might think poker goes flop turn
river
pre-flop flop turn river but i think
it's actually the opposite in terms of

[1:51:15]
it's actually the opposite in terms of
the the effect on your win rate
so this is a very interesting point
because
i used to
think very much from pre-flop to the
river
but nowadays i also see a lot of
benefits from okay what would i indeed

[1:51:30]
benefits from okay what would i indeed
teach i would start with filtering out
the river blunders first so the huge
spews and the hero calls on spots where
they just shouldn't hear a call
but
a big part of my coaching philosophy as
well is often
people don't think i had enough in a

[1:51:45]
people don't think i had enough in a
hand often for example if you get into a
hand with five six offsuit versus otb
big button i say yeah okay we could talk
about the rest of the hand but you
shouldn't have been in the hand any any
mistake any tough spot that will now
follow is a result of you getting in the
hand pre-flop where you shouldn't have

[1:52:01]
hand pre-flop where you shouldn't have
been so there that's very important and
from an ev perspective if you look at
the solver any so on the flop anything
that you decide to put into a solver or
any issues that you make will not make
any difference but that's because the

[1:52:15]
any difference but that's because the
solver regardless of the sizing that you
choose is gonna ask you turn a river
perfectly and if you make a mistake he
will sort of make up for that mistake on
the turn and the river and that's why on
the river in a solver there's no more

[1:52:30]
the river in a solver there's no more
future play right we don't have an ocean
in you know we don't have a sixth guard
uh
so he can no longer make up for the
mistake that you make on the earlier
street i personally always say that
forget about evs okay on the flop you
don't have to look at it because they

[1:52:45]
don't have to look at it because they
don't matter right it's the same as
sometimes i see oh someone oh i have to
float this hand fifty percent of the
time then they float it and then they
forget to bluff it i'm like oh yeah if
you're not gonna bluff it on the lady
street you shouldn't have floated it on
the flop
but to
may come come full circle now into a

[1:53:01]
may come come full circle now into a
question uh for you what do you think
then
do you understand what i mean when i say
that
flop i think is very important because
certain hands lead to tough spots and
mistake
let's say for example you have a hand
that clearly wants to bat big in order

[1:53:17]
that clearly wants to bat big in order
to avoid future street play okay i think
this is a common example but he starts
with a small sizing which in the solver
is
you know doesn't really make much of a
difference because the solver is going
to use turner river to play it perfectly

[1:53:30]
to use turner river to play it perfectly
but then often they get into s-plate
scenarios on turner river because they
didn't think a hat with their hand on
the flop so from that perspective i
would say
flop is most important because that's
where you decide where the head is going
to go
right same on the turn let's say for

[1:53:45]
right same on the turn let's say for
example you have a very poor bluff
catcher on the river given your blocker
properties or given the type of your
opponent you're playing against
then you should think ahead to the river
realize that you have a very poor bluff
catcher given your blockers or your
opponent's player profile so you should

[1:54:01]
opponent's player profile so you should
not move that hand into a bluff catch
line and therefore you should try to bet
that hand so you avoid getting in a
minus ev
bluff catch spot on the river
so that in my opinion is very important
that's an argument why i think flop is
super important but then again if people

[1:54:15]
super important but then again if people
spew the river in spots right they just
shouldn't hear a call but they
call it 50 of the time because that's
what the solver says i think that's also
a very big mistake but which one you
think is most important
that that did it's fascinating because
there are so many facets to the game

[1:54:30]
there are so many facets to the game
because everything you're saying is
super correct i agree with you and and
the game is just so multi-dimensional
uh i you know it's tough to say which is
that they're oh wait why does it say on
my screen i'm still here okay that was

[1:54:46]
my screen i'm still here okay that was
going to quit the talk
but yeah i think
you know there are a lot of things that
are important and what i like about what
we're both saying
is we're talking about things that are
they have an influence on your win rate

[1:55:01]
they have an influence on your win rate
right like whether you see bet
one-third on this texture or half on
that texture is not really going to have
a big effect on your win rate
but there are hands where you should be
doing something else
like you mentioned and recognizing that

[1:55:16]
like you mentioned and recognizing that
will give you an immediate win rate
boost
um
river can give you immediate win rate
boosts and and definitely planning the
hand ahead
this is also something one of my first
coaches told me i think i had like two

[1:55:31]
coaches told me i think i had like two
coaching sessions with a guy who was
charging 100 an hour in my first year in
poker and one of the first things he
told me was he said you know before you
make a flop bet
think about what you're going to do on a
turn think about what you're going to do

[1:55:45]
turn think about what you're going to do
like which turns are you going to take
what actions which errors are you going
to take what actions and that's often
going to affect your flaw decision if
you think ahead maybe you decide you
know this this shouldn't be a bet so i i
think this is what you're mentioning
yeah

[1:56:00]
yeah
it's it's an advanced skill it's super
important
again i i'm not sure everyone is capable
of thinking about it this way i think
some guys need clear guidelines

[1:56:15]
some guys need clear guidelines
uh but but definitely
you know
yeah i i i can't judge which like you
have to do both if you want to be very
good at poker you have to
[Music]
you know some sometimes people come in
and tell me

[1:56:30]
and tell me
uh you know i'm on a downswing
i think it's because of this reason or
that reason let's work on that and i
always tell them you know we're just
working on everything there's no
any improvement we can make in any spot
in your game is good i don't care about
your redline i don't care that you

[1:56:46]
your redline i don't care that you
overfold rivers or underfold rivers we
just want to make you
you know better across the board and
anything we can find like like you were
saying sometimes someone will ask you
about the river and you'll tell them
like you should have folded preflop

[1:57:00]
like you should have folded preflop
i think that that's really good advice
and a really good way of looking at at
every hand
as something holistic where
you know it's not about the river
decision or the turn decision it's about
the underlying thought process that you

[1:57:15]
the underlying thought process that you
have and that you use to play poker and
we want to
improve that so that you win more money
right that that's what
most guys want when they play poker at
least yeah that's in the end the goal
right and with that you need a better
understanding of

[1:57:30]
understanding of
why for example a prefab range big line
versus button looks the way it looks so
if you understand the why
and the mechanics right of how of how
the range looks and how it works then
you from there you can estimate the
situation yourself and come up with your
own prefab range right and this works

[1:57:46]
own prefab range right and this works
for
post flop as well oh why does a solver
like how does it generate ev by taking
this sizing can i generate ev in the
same way
in practice or even in a higher way by
choosing a different sizing right these

[1:58:00]
choosing a different sizing right these
are these are ways i think it's
important to think about the game i
thought it was interesting that you said
that uh when i started to on my rambo
about how we should look ahead and how
you know often we get an s plate
scenarios where i was like yeah this is
indeed a tough spot you should have
prevented getting in the top spot i

[1:58:16]
prevented getting in the top spot i
think actually this is a very important
skill in poker like i i i mentioned it
this in the mechanics as well i say it's
not that
i don't think the decision you're in now
is a tough decision and it's not like i
would make a better decision i design my

[1:58:30]
would make a better decision i design my
strategy in a way that i don't get in
that spot as frequently as you do
and once you start to realize that it's
like
yeah you get into asplate scenarios
constantly where you're in a tough spot
because of the way you plan your hand
i plan it differently so i avoid getting

[1:58:46]
i plan it differently so i avoid getting
in these tough spots right
but you mentioned that that is a skill
and also you mentioned the questionnaire
that you believe that you need talent in
order to succeed is that then one of
these talents
that a

[1:59:00]
that a
player can have that other players don't
that makes them excel and what do you
think are some talents that you need to
possess to become a successful poker
player
um so so i think it depends on your
definition of being successful and like
i was saying if you're satisfied at

[1:59:16]
i was saying if you're satisfied at
beating 2-4 the talents you need are
different than if you want to make it
all the way up to nosebleeds
but what you're describing you know if
if i talk to someone and he's talking
about hands
and he starts saying on the flop

[1:59:31]
and he starts saying on the flop
um
something like you know i that this is a
hand that i want to bet big
because then i fold this and this hand
that would later dominate my hand when i
make top hair and but but this player

[1:59:45]
make top hair and but but this player
type is this and that so i'm going to do
so if someone starts talking like that i
instantly think you know that this guy's
making it to high stakes right like some
someone who's able to for me even if
everything he's saying is wrong like
that that doesn't matter if he's right
or wrong it's more the

[2:00:01]
or wrong it's more the
the depth that he's able to analyze
because i can i can teach him to to do
it correctly
but if he's able to to think deeply and
quickly about these spots i think that's
to make it to high stakes

[2:00:15]
to make it to high stakes
i think to like lower mid stakes is a
lot more
about uh discipline
and if you kind of play solid and you
don't do nonsense plays
that is often i mean not that playing

[2:00:31]
that is often i mean not that playing
solid is simple
but you don't need to be able to do all
these things you can execute much
simpler things and and beat loti
mistakes
uh so so really depends i think what the

[2:00:45]
uh so so really depends i think what the
guy is looking for and i i had something
else i wanted to say like i forgot what
it was so
um
[Music]
did you ask something else i'm
i'm going on on i mean to be honest i
went on a little bit of a ramble so i
don't blame you uh i honestly also don't

[2:01:01]
don't blame you uh i honestly also don't
remember exactly uh i will just add
something and maybe it will pop into
your mind i usually advise that i will
give as well or what i sometimes see is
when a player is playing 1500 and now
2010l they are trying to make 5k plays

[2:01:15]
2010l they are trying to make 5k plays
while their goal should be
to make plays that will get them to the
next level first right and that's kind
of you mentioned already just play solid
but i think we need to define a little
bit yuri what is solid we had the same
conversation with jared mann he said

[2:01:30]
conversation with jared mann he said
just play solid
right and that was very good advice but
what
can you you try to define what solid
means
um that that that's a really good
question because if it were easy to play
solid everyone would play solid and
obviously a lot of people struggle

[2:01:46]
obviously a lot of people struggle
at 50 now
and i think uh the thing you described
with 5k and l is an example
of a leak a lot of guys have where they
get to the river and they're trying to
think
what is my range which combos should i

[2:02:01]
what is my range which combos should i
call which combos should i fold where
the thought process they should be using
is a lot more simple
uh in terms of
uh yeah i guess this ties into what i
wanted to say before so we were you were

[2:02:15]
wanted to say before so we were you were
talking about having a really tough
decision on the river
and i think one of the things that you
need to accept in poker
is that each of the hands in your range
is interested in the part being a
specific size
and you're not the only one who has a

[2:02:31]
and you're not the only one who has a
say in this and if your opponent makes
the pot bigger
you're going to be you're going to have
a tough decision and that's unavoidable
and inferior evie is zero that's why it
feels bad
um you can try to eke out a few big

[2:02:46]
um you can try to eke out a few big
blinds with reeds or whatever but but
sometimes hands get into shitty spots
and uh
yeah i i think kind of
it it's tough for people to accept this
when they're at low stakes for sure

[2:03:00]
when they're at low stakes for sure
they're like you know i don't want my
aces to be a zero eb bluff catcher there
has to be a better answer than that
but you know sometimes the guy goes
check raise flop that turns shove river
your asus is a zero eb bluff catcher
like what what can you do about it
there's no

[2:03:15]
there's no
no way to avoid that situation
um so that that was kind of the the
thing i wanted to say about that and
uh
the second thing like what the advice
like i said for low stakes players um

[2:03:33]
there are a few different types of
advice i think playing solid is mostly
like i said treating people as fish
all the guys around you is fish you're a
fish don't think people are super

[2:03:45]
fish don't think people are super
creative
there's kind of like basic
low stakes
don't make hero calls
don't make hero folds
uh don't be tricky and slow play and
randomize just bet your own hands for

[2:04:01]
randomize just bet your own hands for
value
um
try to categorize the players that
you're playing against is ian a knit
fish or an aggro fish or an agro-reg
fish always try to think big picture
i think if if you manage to do all of

[2:04:15]
i think if if you manage to do all of
those reasonably well
and you have a basic strategy of like
understanding
the size of the pot that your hand wants
so don't start being well you know pure
solver will triple barrel my middle pair
and over bet river because like you're

[2:04:32]
and over bet river because like you're
not gonna get those right
middle pair wants one bet to go in so
try to play a line where one bet goes in
and and you'll be okay
if you start getting creative check
raise over bet shoving the river and all

[2:04:46]
raise over bet shoving the river and all
these things when you're at low stakes
you don't know how to do them well
so don't try to to do anything that that
you don't understand i would say
yeah that's a very important one because

[2:05:00]
yeah that's a very important one because
if you don't understand it you in the
end the execution of your strategy is
going to determine your rev right not
the actual strategy so if you try to
follow a solver strategy but you don't
understand it or you don't understand a
certain combo that goes into a certain
sizing or a certain line you will

[2:05:15]
sizing or a certain line you will
butcher the hand on later streets so
it's better to play a strategy that you
understand
and especially also on the flop that you
understand the consequences this will
have on turning river so you execute it
correctly that's way more important and
i thought a very very important point

[2:05:30]
i thought a very very important point
that people should indeed take away is
think about what your hand is worth
and try to get the
right amount of money in that also kind
of prevents you let's say for example
you checked flop check turn and your
opponent block bets you know it's like
hmm no my my hand is worth a little bit

[2:05:47]
hmm no my my hand is worth a little bit
more money so i should raise the river
for example right you said the middle
pair but if you played it in the trade
in a check check check line you will
find the raised river because you notice
hey my hand is worth a little bit more
money so i thought that was uh yeah that
was very good advice

[2:06:01]
was very good advice
yeah i i think it also often helps to
understand the chaos that happens when
you look at po solver
like if you think about check raising
ranges and pure solver check raises
middle pair and it makes no sense why
would you do that

[2:06:15]
would you do that
if you think you know middle pair is
worth about one bet but it appreciates
some protection so maybe you sacrifice a
bit you get the protection you're like
okay so this is a line that makes sense
for middle pair to go into we do it
sometimes
and then if our opponent keeps betting

[2:06:31]
and then if our opponent keeps betting
we're in the shitty spot that you can't
avoid with medium strength hands
sometimes right like if he
he puts in too much money middle pair is
not worth very much
yeah also from a mental game perspective
i think this is important to understand

[2:06:46]
i think this is important to understand
that some spots are just close to zero
ev and that's just it right and
often longest discussions are made
around the zero ev spot where the truth
is if you go right or left either way

[2:07:00]
is if you go right or left either way
you know it's probably going to be close
anyway but people just want they they
want that concrete answer right and i
think it's very important
what you said is to realize you're not
going to get it you know some a lot of
spots are just gonna be close to zero ev

[2:07:15]
spots are just gonna be close to zero ev
and maybe indeed you can squeeze out a
read that makes it a little bit more of
a plus v call or plus v fold whatever
but accepting that that's gonna be the
nature of the spot and sort of
play in line with that i think it's very
important
for sure and kind of look for the plassy

[2:07:32]
for sure and kind of look for the plassy
response like don't
spend all your time studying zero ev
spots like you said you can fall six
five against otb that's a plussy default
uh if you keep looking at block catching

[2:07:45]
uh if you keep looking at block catching
situations and keep thinking about
blockers that are worth half a big blind
in the 200 big blind pot
uh you're not improving as a poker
player in in a relevant way to making
money
so

[2:08:00]
so
a lot of good advice which also brings
me to the fact that i know that you do
coaching what made you start giving
coaching you mentioned that at some
point someone paid you 50 for an hour so
there it was purely financial but i mean
you've been in coaching with your with

[2:08:16]
you've been in coaching with your with
your site gorilla poker uh you've run a
cfp you're still running the cfp
what brought you into coaching what
attracts you to coach other players
so i i think you know i i was a working

[2:08:31]
so i i think you know i i was a working
part-time as a math tutor and an english
tutor as i was studying in university so
i i knew i enjoyed teaching
and
[Music]
i i always you know when i started
coaching random guys which like like you

[2:08:46]
coaching random guys which like like you
said was from a purely
purely for financial reasons like just
the the excitement of getting paid fifty
dollars an hour and realizing that
okay i can make a living
doing doing this thing and then later

[2:09:01]
doing doing this thing and then later
getting paid more than fifty dollars an
hour was a really big thing in the
beginning
and
what happened at some point was that uh
someone who had a
[Music]

[2:09:15]
[Music]
friend uh called avi or abraham
approached me through a mutual friend
and he was on a on an extended downswing
and he he was looking for help and and
we we discussed could could we do some
long-term arrangement

[2:09:30]
long-term arrangement
um
and at the point where i was in my poker
understanding i i kind of had the
feeling
that i could help anyone
become a winner you know what i mean
like i i know the things that you need
to know and you need to execute

[2:09:46]
to know and you need to execute
so if if
of course i did not know the range of
people that you could coach in
retrospect obviously i couldn't help
anyone become a winner but that was how
i felt back then
um
and then when we started doing long-term
coaching i thought it made sense to have

[2:10:02]
coaching i thought it made sense to have
a slightly larger group so we started
with
i think we started with three guys
and we were just uh stud like i was
coaching them but in a way we were
studying together as well because as i
was coaching like when you coach long

[2:10:16]
was coaching like when you coach long
term
uh you are not
this is a big difference between
long-term coaching and short-term
coaching that when you do short-term
coaching very often you're teaching
everyone the first
the the same types of things in the

[2:10:30]
the the same types of things in the
first few hours
but when you do long-term coaching and
you've already worked with someone for
10 hours
the next hours you're working on much
deeper parts of the game and it helps
you to improve a lot more as well
and so coaching for profit i think

[2:10:47]
and so coaching for profit i think
is one of the things that developed my
game the most because i was forced to
constantly
you know i have to keep teaching these
guys new things we've been working
together you know six hours a week for a
year and i still need to teach them new

[2:11:01]
year and i still need to teach them new
things so we keep kind of digging deeper
and deeper and deeper
and i think
you know for me i i enjoy studying with
other people more than i enjoy studying

[2:11:15]
other people more than i enjoy studying
alone i i feel like something about
having a dialogue and having feedback
so
yeah i
i i guess i i it got started that way uh
the the first guy who joined avi did

[2:11:31]
the the first guy who joined avi did
really really well immediately because
he was a super talented guy
he just you know some some people lose
their way in some point especially you
know po solver coming out
you start implementing everything wrong
and even if you have a knack for the

[2:11:45]
and even if you have a knack for the
game that could easily destroy your win
rate
so you you point if you find the right
people you point them in the right
direction they tend to do well fairly
fast
um
so yeah i met a bunch of cool guys doing

[2:12:01]
so yeah i met a bunch of cool guys doing
that uh
really fun stuff i i know you have you
you used to or do you still have uh
coaching for profit i'm not sure we used
to yeah
and and and you stopped because it was
too much work i guess yeah too intensive

[2:12:15]
too much work i guess yeah too intensive
but this is also because of my character
basically when someone would come in i
would say okay i'm gonna do everything
in my power
uh
in order to make you succeed failing was
basically not an option so i got i
engaged myself that much that it became
a bit too much for me so that's why i

[2:12:31]
a bit too much for me so that's why i
took a step back basically
to think about myself a little bit more
than constantly thinking for others
yeah i mean
for me coaching for profit i think was
not the highest

[2:12:46]
not the highest
dollar ev thing that i could do at any
point i was never you know charging as
much as other groups
um or there was never like a volume
requirement or anything like that
i always kind of trusted people to play

[2:13:02]
i always kind of trusted people to play
as much as is appropriate for them
because it's their life and you know if
you play when you don't want to play i'm
not sure it's a good idea
but you know i i met a lot of
interesting people

[2:13:15]
interesting people
good connections learned lots of things
working together
and i think in poker just having a
community
and having feedback and and talking to
two players at a similar level is is so
useful that

[2:13:30]
useful that
um
yeah i i i don't know i i think coaching
is just uh a very
very pot has always been a very positive
experience for me
just forcing me to think about things on

[2:13:45]
just forcing me to think about things on
a deeper level
and also like watching people who you've
coached succeed this is an amazing
amazing feeling
uh watching them not succeed is less
you you mentioned
having seen people not succeed and you

[2:14:00]
having seen people not succeed and you
also mentioned that you cannot help
everyone why do you think some people
you also mentioned some people just lose
their way why do you think some people
in your cfe your experience for example
why didn't some of your students succeed
i i mean in the end like we were saying

[2:14:17]
i i mean in the end like we were saying
poker is a it's a competitive endeavor
so
that there are a bunch of things that
you need in order to succeed one of them
is being able to handle swings and kind
of stay stable emotionally

[2:14:30]
of stay stable emotionally
execute correct decisions and have good
thought processes and
you know
there was a guy i knew who i worked with
who went through a divorce as he was
playing poker and went on a big down
swing and he was not able to recover
from that

[2:14:45]
from that
um and and so that i think there's the
emotional aspect there's also
you know some guys uh
you you guys know i know you guys had
tobias on the on the podcast
so tobias was one of the first guys in

[2:15:00]
so tobias was one of the first guys in
our group but
he was obviously more talented than the
previous guys before him
and some guys you know when when you
like they felt like i was a good coach
but they see tobias and they know they
can never be tobias so they say you know

[2:15:15]
can never be tobias so they say you know
maybe poker is not for me
now they get disencouraged interesting
yeah some guys get encouraged they're
like okay if he can do this maybe i can
do this but sometimes you're like okay
like this guy is just sharper than i am
i cannot compete with this guy so

[2:15:31]
i cannot compete with this guy so
you know maybe
seeing the people around you being very
very talented can be encouraging but it
can also be discouraging in terms of
you know you realize this game is
tougher than you thought it was you

[2:15:46]
tougher than you thought it was you
realize how smart some of the people
you're competing against are and
[Music]
like we said uh you know poker is not
for everyone this is not like the
american dream just work hard enough and
then you'll succeed

[2:16:00]
then you'll succeed
uh it's very very competitive
it's a food chain it's a predatory game
and i mean this in the most positive way
like not everyone can be an nba star
um
and yeah if you're happy being at a
certain place you can often get their

[2:16:17]
certain place you can often get their
low mid stakes but
not everyone can make it through high
state through to high stakes and i think
some people
maybe get that illusion shattered even
if maybe they could have made it like i
don't know if they could or they

[2:16:30]
don't know if they could or they
couldn't but they see
people around them you know working
harder getting things faster and then
they they just don't don't want to do it
anymore i imagine at least
yeah when the belief falls away
when the belief is not there anymore
yeah why would you yeah then then it's

[2:16:47]
yeah why would you yeah then then it's
it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy
because there's there's so much variance
also like uh what the the guy who taught
me how to play who is you know the same
guy who i said had the super computer
brain and magic the gathering he's a guy

[2:17:00]
brain and magic the gathering he's a guy
who got me into poker
and he he was an amazing poker player
but his first year playing poker uh he
ran 100k on the ev he had like a huge
and this is the first year like this is
really huge imagine

[2:17:17]
really huge imagine
during this year
he wins
60 000 and he should win 160 000
and he was constantly taking these bad
beats and suck outs and all these things
on the river and losing with his aces to

[2:17:31]
on the river and losing with his aces to
kings all the time
and
you know he just he couldn't take it he
didn't want he didn't enjoy it so so
even your ability to
i think i've heard some good players say
this that part of being a successful

[2:17:45]
this that part of being a successful
poker player
is being lucky enough that the big
downswing doesn't come during your first
two years but comes later when when
you're stronger and then are able to
handle it because if you start out
and uh you know the the huge

[2:18:00]
and uh you know the the huge
i i think i had a friend who who ran 200
lines over evie on over the course of a
year
and he he he went through that he kept
playing it it was insane to watch
he's still playing up until this day but

[2:18:15]
he's still playing up until this day but
not a lot of people are able to handle
something like that so there's even
just being able to handle the variants
and being lucky enough that the variance
comes at the correct time
um i i think like that there are so many
things going on the the support network

[2:18:32]
things going on the the support network
like does your partner support you
playing poker do your parents and your
family and your friends support you
playing poker
a hat can have a big effect on how you
handle these types of things
and i even had a friend who was you know

[2:18:46]
and i even had a friend who was you know
he succeeded playing poker he was doing
well
but he never wanted to to play poker uh
like for his entire life it was you know
he was doing it while he was in college
and when he finished he went and got his
dream job

[2:19:01]
dream job
as a computer programmer so opposite of
me but
uh yeah i don't know like that i mean in
the end you both succeeded right you
both got your dream job i i think so i
think so yeah
but yeah the the variance is pretty it's

[2:19:16]
but yeah the the variance is pretty it's
pretty insane i remember also a friend
of mine who then showed i think uh was a
couple years ago he had a one million
year and he looked and if you looked at
this
uh win rates per stakes he ran i think
he was 100k below ev on 2k

[2:19:31]
he was 100k below ev on 2k
uh so that's quite like 50 bucks below a
v on 2k
and he ran super hot on 5k plus
imagine imagine if that's the opposite
so he won a million and maybe then
i only won like 200k
and

[2:19:45]
and
my friend was the opposite he ran 50
binds over ev at one two and two four
moved up and then ran you know 40 bans
on the ev at 10 20 and 25 50.
and especially at that stake it's even
it's even worse because the compound

[2:20:00]
it's even worse because the compound
effect of that shot working out or not
working out is so insane it's like
hundreds of thousands of dollars
another big thing that i saw in rcfp is
why students feel is financial stress
i think if you play poker on the

[2:20:16]
i think if you play poker on the
financial stress it's just killing uh
you will lose your joy for the game
you'll become very result oriented bad
beats are gonna hurt you way less you
will get into a negative spiral so
especially earlier on in your career
being smart with your finances so you
don't get into much financial stress uh

[2:20:32]
don't get into much financial stress uh
i think it's is so key for your career
to actually have a chance to lift off
and become a success
also a very big thing that i usually see
is way too big
swings in confidence basically they
swing their confidence swings with the

[2:20:46]
swing their confidence swings with the
variants so if they did well they feel
like the best in the world
and that also then impacts
how consistent they are in executing
their strategy studying so
due to the swings and due to the
confidence that goes with that they

[2:21:00]
confidence that goes with that they
become less consistent and that uh
yeah that's gonna impact uh maybe also
game selection you know they think
they're better than they are because of
short-term variance uh that so
seeing seeing the world

[2:21:15]
seeing seeing the world
or seeing your your where you are now up
more objectively and not having it go up
and down is also very important i'm sure
you work with a lot of students uh
adam that
go with these ups and downs in
confidence with the variants
uh yeah i would say i've worked with a

[2:21:31]
uh yeah i would say i've worked with a
lot of players who have been struggling
to deal with poker downswings and yeah
it's one of those skills where
it's really hard as a poker player to
not be attached to your results and like
you said if you throw in that kind of
variable of financial pressure and
you're playing poker all day you haven't

[2:21:46]
you're playing poker all day you haven't
got much of a life outside of poca it
becomes this real almost like pressure
pot where your results become your life
and yeah a lot of players
who i work with have points of their
career where they'll hit a downswing or
their results aren't going their way and

[2:22:00]
their results aren't going their way and
their life just unravels and what i've
definitely experienced with players who
have a lot more success they find a way
to detach themselves from their results
enough that they can see their results
are just a sample size it's just
variants of this objectivity with their
results and that's uh there's so many

[2:22:16]
results and that's uh there's so many
skills that come into that there's a
skill of perspective to see the bigger
picture there's a skill of emotional
regulation that needs to come in so you
can regulate your emotions in real time
there's like a yuri taught about having
your life in balance having a good
family set up
it's been good with money so you're not

[2:22:30]
it's been good with money so you're not
under pressure so there's a huge
cocktail of just solving one problem
about being attached to results that
yeah i think a lot of players would
neglect this area until it hits breaking
point or they just haven't developed the
skills throughout their career to deal
with adversity in all honesty so uh one

[2:22:45]
with adversity in all honesty so uh one
of the skills i try to help players
build is resilience because almost no
matter what career you have even though
someone like yuri's had a very linear
career with not as many setbacks as most
players you have to learn to deal with
adversity but you have to build a level
of resilience in yourself so you can

[2:23:00]
of resilience in yourself so you can
overcome tough times so yeah there's a a
lot of reasons i think why players
struggle with down swings end results
but yeah it's definitely a
skill set various skill sets that you
need to come together to uh to kind of
solve that problem
so i want to quickly transition to uh i
know you he's talked about some of the

[2:23:15]
know you he's talked about some of the
kind of strategy aha moments you had i
think it was three technical points of
your career where you had big
breakthroughs i'd like to know if
there's any uh life lessons that poker
has taught you you could look back on
your career is there any like valuable
life lessons you've learned on your on
your journey

[2:23:31]
your journey
quite quite a few i think quite a few um
i think one
[Music]
uh one
let me think
um
so

[2:23:46]
so
i think that the way that you think
about poker hands is the
thought process that i've applied to to
real life where
when you think about
the river and you think about a combo

[2:24:00]
the river and you think about a combo
and you're like you know
he would not have bet that size on the
turn with this combo so that's not in
his range so you kind of
you use an analytical thought process
about the situation by thinking of the
context of everything that led to the
situation

[2:24:16]
situation
and you can use this in real life to
kind of solve all sorts of puzzles
even relationship puzzles like
i mean maybe some people do it in a more
intuitive way but
um

[2:24:31]
yeah i think i've been able to use kind
of the the
poker problem-solving process in in
various areas in my personal life
to understand what's going on at kind of
a deeper level
um
[Music]

[2:24:46]
[Music]
i think that that's one uh the second
one has to do with uh
with the way i think about money
and you know how i say i'm risk-averse
but i can only say that amongst poker
players
right like to any non-poker player the

[2:25:01]
right like to any non-poker player the
amounts of risk in my life and my
investment portfolio everything
uh are are insane and hard to imagine
for a normal person
um
[Music]
you know

[2:25:15]
you know
yeah the
ju just the way the poker lifestyle
works where
um i i sometimes think of poker as a job
like
uh
people go through these emotional swings
and other jobs but probably like 1 000

[2:25:32]
and other jobs but probably like 1 000
times more slowly
like you will have a project that you do
in your job over six months and then if
it does badly
maybe it's just variance but then you
might be tilted and and then the next
project you might start it out a bit

[2:25:45]
project you might start it out a bit
worse
and do worse you'll be angry you won't
use the same thought processes but
everything is at the human pace
and when you play poker
you know you just lose this huge part
imagine you're like a surgeon operating
and your patient dies and then you're
like okay next patient go next patient

[2:26:02]
like okay next patient go next patient
go like it never stops
it's a really
i i maybe i'm not answering your
question anymore i'm just so associately
talking but uh it it's a really insane
job the the types of skills and mental

[2:26:16]
job the the types of skills and mental
stamina that you develop
i think they they are relevant they help
you everywhere
um
they really help you like when when
things go wrong
uh when you don't perform well like uh

[2:26:32]
uh when you don't perform well like uh
if i make a mistake
uh somewhere some people beat themselves
up over mistakes or like uh you know
that there are people i know who when
they have to to give it a lecture go on
an interview they're super stressed for

[2:26:46]
an interview they're super stressed for
for weeks and months and and poker is
such a high stress environment and you
have to learn to deal with that
i think you know it it just develops a
skill set that is very very useful like
i imagine if i were going to study

[2:27:00]
i imagine if i were going to study
something and i failed at the test i'm
not gonna be too hard on myself i'm i'm
gonna be able to handle that
very easily and you know poker you have
to be able to handle failure you have to
be able to handle uncertainty
um

[2:27:15]
um
so like if if i'm i'm gonna buy a new
car
i'm i'm not sure it's the best car maybe
i'm making a bad decision i i can live
with risk very very well in all aspects
of my life
um you know during coronavirus

[2:27:31]
um you know during coronavirus
um a lot of people who are not used to
thinking about risk of infection
do crazy irrational things
[Music]
for some guys it makes sense for some
guy like if you're 80 years old

[2:27:45]
guy like if you're 80 years old
obviously it's different than if you're
20 years old the kind of risks you
should be taking
but poker kind of i think trains you to
be able to look at everything and
integrate it and understand the risks
and then come to to the best decision uh

[2:28:01]
and then come to to the best decision uh
that you're able to it's kind of
automatic right like this is how this is
what we do at work every day
so when an investment opportunity comes
up
i don't need it to be a hundred percent
i i know what questions to ask and yeah

[2:28:16]
i i know what questions to ask and yeah
just you know general all around
poker has a ton of life skills inside
and and you're just turbo charged you're
like living life at 100x space
and
emotionally learning these things

[2:28:31]
emotionally learning these things
mentally learning these things i think
it's super useful um or you know
sometimes it breaks you and you run away
right not everyone's built for it
yeah i think like you said poker is one
of those things where things happen at

[2:28:45]
of those things where things happen at
fast pace and you've almost got to learn
quickly if you don't learn quickly poker
is not going to be very forgiving for
you so yeah there's almost like two
skills simultaneously there at the end
where you talk about the ability to
handle risk and to accept risk and to uh
quantify risk in varying scenarios and

[2:29:01]
quantify risk in varying scenarios and
then there's the skill of dealing with
the consequences of failure when things
go wrong when your
your dreams don't get realized and at
the point tables it's almost like a
daily occurrence where emotions that
you've never had to deal with so if i
look at my life pre-poker my emotional

[2:29:15]
look at my life pre-poker my emotional
state i could avoid most my emotions
almost always i could find something to
do that would allow me to not have to
handle my emotional state at the poker
tables good luck good luck hiding from
all the uncertainty old self-doubt it's
you've got to learn that skill of these
emotions are coming up you're going to

[2:29:30]
emotions are coming up you're going to
have to learn that skill of dealing with
your emotions or poker is not going to
fit for you so yeah i always like trying
to play as it yourself who've been in
poker a long time because you've had to
develop that skill if not there'll just
be no way that you'd be enjoying this
process of being a poker player at this
stage so yeah i liked all those skills

[2:29:45]
stage so yeah i liked all those skills
we talked about problem solving and the
ability to uh yeah basically think ahead
and holistically about decision making
in a wide range of scenarios you talk
about money even though you're generally
a risk-averse person but in the poker
context you've learned how to manage
money and manage risk and then we talk
about risks and consequences in a

[2:30:01]
about risks and consequences in a
broader context and like you said with
corvids a lot of people making
ridiculously irrational decisions for us
poker players who could just say okay
these are these are the options these
are probabilities let's just choose an
option and be okay with it a lot of
irrational kind of um yeah i guess

[2:30:16]
irrational kind of um yeah i guess
thought processes and emotions coming up
around uh those those times of times in
people's lives so yeah really good skill
i'm glad you shared those so next
question is is there anything you would
do different in your career could go
back maybe to a certain point is
anything looking back on your career so

[2:30:31]
anything looking back on your career so
far you do differently
yes yes i was like my first instinct was
to say no because you know i'm happy
with where i am and if you change
something you don't know where you end
up
but i think the number one thing i would

[2:30:45]
but i think the number one thing i would
have done differently is been more
organized about taxes
i think a lot of poker players
you know you start out it's a hobby
you're making a low amount of money and
if you transition to making more
and you're slow about dealing with it
with accountants it just the complexity

[2:31:02]
with accountants it just the complexity
of the problem grows the longer you wait
so what one big thing i would have done
is take that more seriously earlier like
it's all fine everything sorted it was
not a big deal

[2:31:15]
not a big deal
but it was pretty stressful
it's it's a lot easier to to do your
taxes in advance than to do them a few
years late let's put it that way
um so i think for anyone aspiring to be
a professional figure out the tax laws

[2:31:30]
a professional figure out the tax laws
uh figure out how it's going to work you
know when you're making 1k a month you
don't need to pay taxes but
very often things escalate quickly in
poker so something to
to think about
um
in kind of uh in terms of how my career

[2:31:48]
in kind of uh in terms of how my career
progressed
i think that
um
i i think it's hard to to separate
everything from like my my personal
development my emotional development

[2:32:02]
development my emotional development
so obviously in retrospect there are a
bunch of tips i would have given myself
i would have you know
done better handled things easier but
you just sometimes have to learn things
the hard way
and and you were saying in the beginning
like i had everything planned in terms

[2:32:16]
like i had everything planned in terms
of being risk-averse i didn't have
anything planned i was just risk-averse
right i was just scared so i didn't move
up it was not part of a plan
um
and
[Music]
um

[2:32:31]
um
yeah i think one of the big issues one
of the big disadvantages with poker for
me is that
poker is all the time at the computer at
this kind of fast pace
and this i have a bit of a computer game

[2:32:46]
and this i have a bit of a computer game
addiction i'm calling like you can call
it an addiction or not an addiction but
poker and spending so many hours at the
computer made me
often take breaks by playing other
computer games and i think in retrospect

[2:33:00]
computer games and i think in retrospect
that probably hurt me quite a lot in a
number of ways even in terms of
just
kind of being able to recover from
whatever is happening in poker because
you don't want to feed your brain new
information you want to let it process

[2:33:16]
information you want to let it process
and let it rest
so i think um
like if we're talking about mental game
coaching
uh
or yeah i i would i wish i would have
gotten more mental game coaching earlier

[2:33:31]
gotten more mental game coaching earlier
than i did as soon as i did it had a big
impact i think my first two hours with
jared
which you know cost a lot of money for
me at the time but i i can't stress how
valuable that type of work can be for a

[2:33:45]
valuable that type of work can be for a
poker player
and it's
it's really hard to quantify but just
the effect that having
more stable confidence has on the
quality of your life and the quality of
your decisions is

[2:34:00]
your decisions is
yeah can't say how big that is but uh
yeah i i guess one more thing
in retrospect maybe because i have a
family now and i can't be a dj and
travel to the live stops and entities

[2:34:15]
travel to the live stops and entities
and stuff like that
maybe i would have done that a bit more
earlier on because now it's so much
harder to manage
and there is this you know when when
you're young and single and no
responsibilities it feels like you have

[2:34:30]
responsibilities it feels like you have
infinite time to do everything
but if you think of your life
just like we think of like poker is one
long session so your life is one long
session
uh you're not always gonna have an
abundance of time and freedom to do

[2:34:45]
abundance of time and freedom to do
whatever you want so
like had i been more aware of that and
managed my time more effectively
and played it's sad to say i love
playing computer games i played too too
much computer games during those for
sure
and uh

[2:35:01]
and uh
yeah we would have changed the balance a
bit in those respects it's not very
poker strategy heavy
what i'm saying but uh yeah those those
are my
introspective thoughts i guess yeah
yeah i think it's really interesting to
look back and especially when you're in

[2:35:17]
look back and especially when you're in
a position that you're happy with it's
sometimes hard to like look back and
change things because everything was a
process to get you to where you are now
it's hard to like kind of differentiate
the process of learning to get to where
you are and then things you could have
done differently yeah some of the ones

[2:35:30]
done differently yeah some of the ones
you came up with there were sort of your
taxes i think overall being responsible
for your finances as a poker player
ronnie i know you had to learn the hard
way i was the same it's one of those
things that we just get thrown into all
of a sudden you've got lots of money
which you're not used to having and you
often make bad decisions don't pay your

[2:35:45]
often make bad decisions don't pay your
taxes put yourself in situations that
could have been avoided with a little
bit of financial competency in all
honesty so yeah i think learn the skill
of managing your finances as a poor
player with the assumption that you're
gonna have a lot of money one day like
go don't go in there bro thinking okay
i'm not gonna pay taxes who cares go in

[2:36:01]
i'm not gonna pay taxes who cares go in
there thinking okay i want to have a lot
of money so uh let's start thinking
about a system in advance that's gonna
allow me to uh to generate a lot of
wealth and then you talked about your
addiction to games and potentially that
taking away some of your time to travel
and maybe play some live pokemon maybe a

[2:36:15]
and maybe play some live pokemon maybe a
balancing effect that you needed to uh
learn over time and then your mental
game working on mental game coaching
with minigame coaches and yeah basically
putting time into uh fixing your leaks
that are costing you the most most money
for you it was building confidence and
trying to separate that gap between your

[2:36:30]
trying to separate that gap between your
your a given c game which we've talked
about so yeah great stuff
all right so going into the present time
you've launched your course with upswing
poker talk us through the the process of
creating the course and why now why now
to release that course
um so i started with uh with my youtube

[2:36:50]
um so i started with uh with my youtube
page and website guerrilla poker i think
about two years ago
and it's been
again kind of a slow process because i'm
doing it at the same time as i'm doing a

[2:37:00]
doing it at the same time as i'm doing a
lot of other things so i'm not
doing advertising i'm not you know
creating too much content so i have
everything's kind of been low-key
uh and when upswing when doug approached
me about doing a course i thought it was
just a great business opportunity for me

[2:37:17]
just a great business opportunity for me
you know they're very professional have
very big reach so i get to reach a much
larger audience
much larger audience and they
upswing have a history of making like
long courses like 25 30 hour courses

[2:37:31]
long courses like 25 30 hour courses
which i i never imagined i'd be able to
make so they kind of helped me
think about the subject and and
understand that it is possible to to
make a course of that length which i
i didn't think i would be able to

[2:37:47]
i didn't think i would be able to
at the beginning
um
and
yeah kind of the the process
for me because i've done so much
coaching
uh once i understood kind of the
structure of what i want to talk about

[2:38:01]
structure of what i want to talk about
it's all stuff i've talked about a
million times
so so once you you have the structure
and you have enough experience making
the course was actually very very easy
um
yeah i'm super excited how people like

[2:38:16]
yeah i'm super excited how people like
it like i said i'm i'm reaching a larger
audience audience than i used to i know
that
renee you probably know this too uh you
know most poker content out there is
with a different focus than our approach

[2:38:30]
with a different focus than our approach
and
uh not to say it doesn't work it's just
a different you know there are many ways
to climb the same mountain
um and i i think this is like a big
exposure for the the exploitative
approach that you know not a lot of

[2:38:46]
approach that you know not a lot of
people that are not in the cfp
will ever really learn about or think
about these kind of thought processes
like you were mentioning even
like pre-flop in the course i give
people charts and then
i keep telling them like never ever

[2:39:01]
i keep telling them like never ever
follow the chart if you're following the
chart you're doing it wrong
um
yeah
so um
yeah i think i think it it just kind of
led up to that so so kind of by accident

[2:39:16]
led up to that so so kind of by accident
in terms of timing but uh yeah we're
really excited to see how it's received
by everyone
yeah very exciting stuff it sounds like
a very similar path to renee who did the
cfp did a lot of coaching with students
and the natural kind of progression is

[2:39:31]
and the natural kind of progression is
to uh to make a course for for more
people it sounds like your mind was
already full of ideas and you just need
a little bit of guidance to structure
those ideas and yeah i'm sure that
course will be a very big hit and what
can we expect from you going forward are
you going to be doing youtube content i
know you mentioned your channel what can

[2:39:46]
know you mentioned your channel what can
we expect from you you're going forward
right now
um hmm i'm i'm not sure it it's tough
there are so many things in conqueror i
want to do uh i i probably keep making
youtube content but that's you know
that's like half an hour a week or so

[2:40:01]
that's like half an hour a week or so
it's not a big part of my time
i'm i'm studying a lot with some really
talented people
uh starting to learn plo really excited
about plo's fun game um
and uh

[2:40:15]
and uh
now i was always afraid of plo because
of the variance but i feel like i'm i'm
okay to handle it now
uh yeah playing a lot in in terms of
make like what i do going forwards i i
really can't tell it's like um
i just finished the course we'll we'll

[2:40:30]
i just finished the course we'll we'll
kind of see what happens maybe i make
another course uh
maybe you know i start playing nosebleed
plo maybe i go play live i i
it's really tough to say um
i just like what i love about poker for

[2:40:46]
i just like what i love about poker for
me is each of the options that i'm
saying all sound exciting some hp kind
of any any way the ship sails i'm happy
i love that and i get that feel from you
that there's many options that you could
take right now but all of them seem very
exciting to you let's make a new courses

[2:41:01]
exciting to you let's make a new courses
let's play nosebleeds whether it's
coaching more people they all seem very
yeah in line with your passions and as
we've talked about throughout this
conversation
you've loved poker you've looked your
whole poker journey so yeah whatever
comes next as long as it fits that need
of i enjoy what i'm doing right now yeah

[2:41:16]
of i enjoy what i'm doing right now yeah
it's really really refreshing to hear
someone who's so excited about their
their paths and there's so many
opportunities for you you're going
forwards
great stuff so any of you got any
further questions that you'd like to
throw yuri's way
no uh i think uh i think we've we've

[2:41:31]
no uh i think uh i think we've we've
talked for quite a while right uh i
definitely i definitely uh understand
what you reset like creating a course
it's not once you finally have kind of
stripped down what you're gonna say when
you're gonna say then actual the making

[2:41:45]
you're gonna say then actual the making
it the recording it is not that hard but
it's like okay how well i structure this
what things should i discuss what are
the most important topics uh that's kind
of the that's kind of the tricky part
and in regards to the to the exploitive
stuff it's it's a bit more uh

[2:42:01]
stuff it's it's a bit more uh
special i would say indeed and people
are
a bit more skeptical about talking about
it for example if i make a youtube video
i or do a twitch stream i prefer to just
talk gto ish because it's broad

[2:42:16]
talk gto ish because it's broad
knowledge you know you're not giving
away too much when you really go on the
exploitative train i can go very deep in
certain thought processes that you know
are very different than what you will
see out there so it's a bit more but i

[2:42:30]
see out there so it's a bit more but i
saved this for special people right
safety is for our mechanics of poker uh
students they get they get to know that
and i think that uh
yeah that that that's kind of how it is
and indeed that usually is reserved for
cfp so it's good that it now is becoming

[2:42:45]
cfp so it's good that it now is becoming
a bit more mainstream
um i i i will say like when making the
course i had this kind of thought that
if i describe an exploit in a big course
then kind of the x you kill the exploit
right it doesn't work anymore because

[2:43:01]
right it doesn't work anymore because
everyone knows about it and then you you
don't have confidence to do it so
in the course i i mostly i think i
i teach how to
how to go about building your own
exploits more than i teach a specific

[2:43:16]
exploits more than i teach a specific
exploit i get people into the frame of
mind and give them the tools
so that when they study on their own
they are
they're building exploits they're
thinking about things in in this kind of
way
and uh

[2:43:30]
and uh
yeah definitely when playing online you
can you can't play exploitative with
serious stakes and and stream it
everywhere that's like suicide i feel
for your game
yes that's not a great idea right the
the costs are too big then but i but

[2:43:47]
the costs are too big then but i but
we do the same i mean that's why it's
called the mechanics of poker the focus
on the mechanics of exploitation is way
more valuable than oh here's uh here's a
sheet of data uh big blind versus ep

[2:44:00]
sheet of data uh big blind versus ep
triple barrel gets bluff 24 it's like
okay memorize this yeah that's not
really useful right and these things
change so everything that we try to make
in the mechanics i try to make as
timeless as possible by really focusing
on broader concepts you know it's like

[2:44:15]
on broader concepts you know it's like
oh how do you find and exploit how
doesn't how does a range imbalance
uh being
how can i explain this what is like the
range construction error that leads to
an over bluff spot under blood spot
these are way more valuable concepts

[2:44:30]
these are way more valuable concepts
than just saying like oh do this exploit
here oh always bluff catch here oh this
is the percentage the population bluffs
in this spot
so way more timeless approaches so i'm
i'm a big fan of that
yeah i'd love to study with you sometime
if you still do that oh yeah sure i'm

[2:44:47]
if you still do that oh yeah sure i'm
always up for it
okay okay sounds good
all right any any last things you still
want to add to
to the pot
let me think so uh first it's been a

[2:45:01]
let me think so uh first it's been a
pleasure talking to both of you really
enjoyed the
the call
um i i it's fun to find someone like you
like we said it
sounds like we think about things very
similarly so not too much

[2:45:16]
similarly so not too much
you know you usually you have to qualify
exploitative thought processes a bit
more people have this inner objection
like how can you fold it if it's in the
chart how can you bluff if it's minus cv
what if the other guy does this right
there i think you know we're both on the

[2:45:31]
there i think you know we're both on the
yeah
um
[Music]
i have this metaphor where like imagine
you're floating in the sea and gto is
like your life raft and you're holding
on to it and you think as long as i hold
on to this
no one can hurt me and i'm safe

[2:45:46]
no one can hurt me and i'm safe
uh an exploitative poker like you let go
you learn to actually swim and and you
learn like how the game actually works
and like you can play your entire game
holding the life raft but that it's it's

[2:46:00]
holding the life raft but that it's it's
not much fun it gets boring you get the
same view all the time
while the the style that we both teach
and we both play
poker is such a creative game you can
never get bored you keep enjoying it and
being creative and having fun

[2:46:16]
being creative and having fun
and uh
yeah kind kind of a never-ending process
like every day you can find new things
every hand is interesting
it's never like oh this play is standard
or that play is standard well not never

[2:46:30]
or that play is standard well not never
but you know what i mean
um
so
yeah
just fun talking to you guys uh
like you were saying i have a new course
out uh
on upswing elite cash game exploits uh

[2:46:47]
on upswing elite cash game exploits uh
anyone who's interested check it out i
think it's really good but uh and yeah
thanks for having me
all right
well that was
a nice conversation i i always end in

[2:47:00]
a nice conversation i i always end in
the same ways right oh what what a lot
of knowledge what a wisdom bomb has been
dropped upon us and every time it's the
same this time even longer than normal
but that was just because our ghast
was just feeding us with good
information and me and adam were talking

[2:47:16]
information and me and adam were talking
we could hop on a call tomorrow and do a
part two of another three hours because
i listed a bunch of questions that i
didn't even get to ask uh so
if people like
like this podcast then maybe in the

[2:47:30]
like this podcast then maybe in the
future we'll take a take a part two what
were some of the things that really
stand it out for you adam
well where to begin after that
three-hour marathon of knowledge i'd say
one of the first things that came to
mind for reflection was how much yuri

[2:47:45]
mind for reflection was how much yuri
thinks about balance in his life and
he's very particular of trying to create
the life circumstances that allow him to
perform well he talked about having like
kind of polar opposite games that can
show up one way is like a plus 15 winner
winner and a minus 10 loser and when

[2:48:00]
winner and a minus 10 loser and when
you've got that kind of variability in
your game you need to pay a lot of
attention to creating the life
circumstances whether sleep quality
stress management so you show up as your
best self it sounds like over the years
he's got better and better at that skill
set and find that balance so you can
show as his best self more often he also

[2:48:16]
show as his best self more often he also
talked about spotting a lot of the
tendencies that show up and for him he's
talked about it one way he said if he
doesn't want to pay his bills uh then he
should be playing poker me and renee
both thought we would never play because
peanut bills never seems interesting
i'll do taxes whenever so i think it's

[2:48:30]
i'll do taxes whenever so i think it's
finding unique things for you but it's
obviously for him he knows a certain
state of mind would link would lead to
bad performance so he's aware of that
going in next thing we talked about was
um the next thing came up for me was
risk aversion and very interesting how
we even kind of talked about this in the

[2:48:45]
we even kind of talked about this in the
poker context you can only talk about
being risk-averse to non-pro players
really sorry to poker players really but
his ability to navigate to high stakes
whilst being very risk-averse and as we
could see as we went through the kind of
story arch there wasn't many big
setbacks he didn't have a 30 40 50

[2:49:01]
setbacks he didn't have a 30 40 50
buying down swing he didn't have to
rebuild his role because he built his
kind of progression around being a risk
of his personality so a lot of that
would it was a slow journey it cost him
opportunity cost of playing higher
earlier but he knew he did couldn't

[2:49:15]
earlier but he knew he did couldn't
tolerate high risk so he designed almost
like subconsciously originally but he
designed a path that was a low variance
so he was able to navigate a high-risk
environment like poca with a loris
tolerance so if you're someone who has a
loris tolerance you could maybe listen
to the parts of you speaking about that

[2:49:30]
to the parts of you speaking about that
to get some tips on how to uh approach
poker with a risk-based approach and
then finding mental game you give a big
shout out to jared tendla and working on
his mindset and basically said
for himself working on building
confidence has been one of the biggest
things for his win rates and again as we

[2:49:45]
things for his win rates and again as we
talked about he's a very exploitative
intuitive player he thinks very very
deeply about spots and when that's
firing amazing he's got an awesome win
rates well that's not fire in he's
almost like spewing off so with that in
mind he's very susceptible to these big

[2:50:00]
mind he's very susceptible to these big
swings in his game this big variation so
the mental game is gonna be huge for him
and his ability to stay confident in his
players and show up as his best self
during his grind is gonna be huge so uh
yeah a million other things i've
literally got probably 13 other topics i
could have talked about but they're the

[2:50:15]
could have talked about but they're the
main ones for me how about yourself
ready how would you summarize the your
main finance from yuri
yeah i mean we we rambled a lot about a
strategic poker right uh and it was
mainly rambling for me now it's it's a
bit of a big blur uh but there was a lot

[2:50:32]
bit of a big blur uh but there was a lot
of knowledge in there for sure he also
talked a lot about networking right
about getting the right amount of people
the right people around him also from
strategic perspective i think he also
mentioned like oh being told on which
sides to play oh a good side opportunity

[2:50:46]
sides to play oh a good side opportunity
came up and because of his network he
had first choice to go play on that site
for example when the games were still
good
uh i loved the everyone as a fish
example and i think often i think almost

[2:51:01]
example and i think often i think almost
all players have had that when you move
up to a new state you think well here
they're very good but he
generally gives people just very little
credit right he even says i'm a fish as
well so uh i think that that was a very
interesting one and in the end he's he
really talked about

[2:51:15]
really talked about
uh
exploitative play uh what did he say
right he's in the ocean and you hold on
to this life jacket or whatever to this
floating device but when you and then
you then you try to swim that's when you

[2:51:31]
you then you try to swim that's when you
learn exploitive poker and he mentioned
the two words then you can express your
creativity and then it's a lot of fun
and these are two values that uh that i
that i hold highly as well in poker and
and just in general the the building
strategies i love the magic example and

[2:51:47]
strategies i love the magic example and
even my mind went like oh wow how cool
is that so people play a certain deck
and now you're gonna try to put the deck
together that counters that deck
i haven't played magic in years years
years but immediately i felt sort of the
spark inside me that was like oh cool

[2:52:01]
spark inside me that was like oh cool
to develop a strategy like that uh so
yeah really grateful to have mom really
grateful as well that he invited me to
uh to do a study session together so
let's see if a little poker promance
comes out of this podcast
uh the the the exploitative guys hanging

[2:52:17]
