do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a

[00:15]
the site where you can watch a
free one hour demo
yes yes yes yes yes welcome back
to another stream the wacko show
today let me see actually how the zumba
is now because it was quite tough

[00:31]
is now because it was quite tough
still looking quite tough but they had
some knee to my three some can be some
goose core but they all left
not very happy with
how i played i mean ups and downs i
guess

[00:47]
but in general when i say i'm not i'm
not too happy with the way i played i
mainly mean in terms of the quality of
my decision making and the consistency
those were two things that i was
fairly happy about

[01:05]
basically with the king queen of mona
board uses quite a
big sizing for the text

[01:15]
[Music]
checks
not really a hundred percent support

[01:31]
not really a hundred percent support
this hand i think i will pack

[01:47]
[Music]
that's a small three bet
[Music]
flop something
but i do have a feeling we still need to

[02:00]
but i do have a feeling we still need to
improve and preferably not to attend
random factor one time come on
come on king queen

[02:21]
died this guy
ah let's let's hope for a chop

[02:36]
ah let's let's hope for a chop
there's something random but it's very
unlikely to see something random here
maybe a pocket tents

[02:46]
okay if he has jack 10 off then then
then i'm a little bit more happy same
guys for camelot so he treated me with
the with the jack then off he checks
flop okay
oh let's see your turn my friend spade

[03:01]
that's fade but ace ace ain't bad ace
ain't bad
so
i do think with exactly ajak i should

[03:15]
i do think with exactly ajak i should
just focus on trying to get called but i
was tempted as he just showed up with
the jack 10 off to
maybe check and see what's going on
oh my god
what a turn what a turn guy

[03:33]
what a turn what a turn guy
amazing guys amazing turn

[03:46]
amazing guys amazing turn
river nine of hearts
or am i being
oh my god river died of hearts
i literally you asked for the knight of
hearts and they and they just gave it to

[04:00]
hearts and they and they just gave it to
me
what the [ __ ] is going on this is scary
guys
this is scary i basically i just wanted
the blank
right so i can just rip my second

[04:22]
good hand big bad guys come on

[04:37]
good hand my friend but not as good as
mine
i would like to thank you very much okay
[Music]

[04:52]
interesting turn
hmm what do we do on this turner

[05:00]
hmm what do we do on this turner
not really sure but
and now we probably want to do some big
bedding
my batting rates here on the river is

[05:16]
my batting rates here on the river is
probably
ace queen plus
not really sure how this hand would play
i know the flop
also has a big sizings but i'm not
really too comfortable with that

[05:32]
i think actually it's a good example
like i'm pretty sure that flop also has
big sizings but on the meatball
this hand is quite interesting
we called so he opened
we three bet before bet

[05:48]
we three bet before bet
we decided to call
considering a check again but as there
are gonna be some nasty rivers like this
if you lease it would be really weird i

[06:00]
if you lease it would be really weird i
think it's just a bluff
elite
the [ __ ]

[06:16]
the [ __ ] is this
this
i think yeah off no she was like

[06:38]
feels like a king jack suited or
something back 10 suited

[06:46]
oh oh
who the [ __ ] is that guy trying to push

[07:00]
who the [ __ ] is that guy trying to push
me off ace five
okay okay 200 bb poker here
my tip for 200 bba poker is try to get
aces and play some poker
okay he just jams it in well good luck

[07:15]
okay he just jams it in well good luck
my friend
oh my god oh my god
very interesting what the [ __ ] is going
on they have the

[07:31]
on they have the
i think they put it on the twitch action
generator
you know when you log into your
pokestars they say mr wacko are you
twitching today and i say yes
okay we will we will make it extra
interesting

[07:45]
interesting
wow that was like my like i said i had
kings vs aces right before the
stream so that was like my my my
comeback
[ __ ] mouse again seriously i'm gonna get
a different mouse this mouse runs out of
batteries
at a rate jesus what are we flopping

[08:02]
at a rate jesus what are we flopping
the nuts here's the random guy
spr is one i'm gonna go for a little
checky this guy is just random
see if he can do something with his
randomness

[08:15]
randomness
now it's very hard for him to have not
very hard

[08:41]
okay three right here with the five six
interesting turn

[09:00]
i think it would have been hard would
have queens have called down
pretty don't touch this
in general i like to check this exact
hand
if i was 100 bb deep i think i would

[09:16]
if i was 100 bb deep i think i would
consider check raising turn
but i thought for example if it's on the
bb i also think
people do protection bet a little bit
too much
in these positions i would say

[09:31]
so then if for example if people bet
tents and jacks too often i think check
raising here is a good strategy
but i thought that
there was still a chance that he could
bet tents but mainly as like a bluff

[09:47]
bet tents but mainly as like a bluff
to maybe jammed the river so i figured
getting some value out of loss is okay
all of blank rivers i think the hands
that
even not even on blankers even an
attendant jack river i think a set i

[10:00]
attendant jack river i think a set i
still get action from as i'm very king
heavy here
or ace is heavy so i don't think i lose
much value
how he turn over queens
suited good hand

[10:25]
but it's about to think of it oh

[10:30]
i don't think we haven't
i just said that it's a good spot for
him to be checking a lot

[10:47]
him to be checking a lot
with a strong hand okay
and then he jams what does that mean
you have anything better

[11:05]
i guess i'm just calling because i have
a queen but it's a very bad argument
[Music]
okay yeah i i've i have no clue what's

[11:16]
okay yeah i i've i have no clue what's
going on there
you're too good well my friend we're
probably strolling he thought there was
a snap call
i have to say i have no clue what's
going on in that end sauce one two three
in the mix

[11:30]
in the mix
okay is he going to dunk sauce is
dunking 100
sauce is not dunking okay thank you then
we'll just see a turn
hope to improve if not what is yours my
friend
oh [ __ ] [ __ ]

[11:54]
now elite then money are gonna lead
still no elites a little bit

[12:00]
still no elites a little bit
disappointed saucy
forward asis actually this is the thing

[12:16]
forward asis actually this is the thing
right
if you would in this spot if people do
have a leading range i think we should
bet the river
people don't have a leading range i
think we should check the river

[12:30]
yeah that's it that's it
i think sauce is probably having a
leading race i think we should have bet
we missed a clear value
there

[12:48]
interesting flop

[13:04]
oh
upset checky checky guys you know you
know how we roll

[13:29]
seven deuce why didn't i have the seven

[13:32]
seven deuce why didn't i have the seven
dudes
i want to say seven dudes why doesn't it

[13:46]
i want to say seven dudes why doesn't it
allow me to say seven news
hi renee i have a question i saw on
poker news you gotta know the mechanics

[14:01]
poker news you gotta know the mechanics
of pokers that like all the stuff of
poker or only like mental stuff
go over to the site mechanics of
poker ambition.com click on mechanics
there you can see a full
one hour video of everything that is

[14:17]
one hour video of everything that is
inside
it also it's not only mental it's a part
of it the mental the mindset the
technical the soft skills
it's the complete package i'll try a
little donkey donkey just for the fence

[14:31]
little donkey donkey just for the fence
because i know the fans like when i like
it when i throw a little donkey donkey
and i get a face a little razor-razy
which makes me a little sad he said he

[14:47]
he'll make it very small i'm quite
tempted actually to pull
one it's a bit optimistic but i think we
should probably peel this right versus
this sizing yeah
well here i face a four bet i'm gonna
call

[15:02]
actually we turn an ace interesting

[15:19]
[Music]
now we have an easy value bed here

[15:32]
[Music]
now you see it well it was a funky race
i knew it was a funky race
here i think we have an easy car again
he could still be betting the same hand

[15:49]
yeah basically that obviously he could
still be bluffing
now if he had an eight obviously we are
a beat
he blocks again which i do think

[16:00]
he blocks again which i do think
actually is a good play
well on the other table we're gonna
casually three bet the 7d suited
okay i'll keep you guys posted he folded

[16:17]
i mean he could basically still play jax
this way
well i'm not very happy about it
yeah that was very likely good sizing by

[16:33]
yeah that was very likely good sizing by
him i would have fallen to a gem
oh that that is what we call a good flop
guys
okay check it checky check it check it
to the phone player

[16:49]
now what shall we do there's always a
dilemma
do you go for the check race or do you
let the fish do something

[17:01]
the feeling with this hand
now i'm just going to get it in

[17:15]
dallas we have some dilemmas guys good
hands
do we how do we want to get our money in
how do we make most money
those are questions when we have the
nuts on a turn i think it's a clear
jam as he might have like an over pair

[17:31]
jam as he might have like an over pair
which
you can be nitty on the river and our
hand can value gem right
let's say for example at ace king or
something i wouldn't jam it in
alright guys i want to thank you all for
