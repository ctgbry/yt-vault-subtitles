[00:00]
let's go another one of these they
they just keep ripping in ace king
versus me that's good you know every
time is six percent
oh he cashed out so it's me against
poker stars
oh hey at least this is this is this is

[00:16]
oh hey at least this is this is this is
perfect man
this is perfect

mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo hello hello hello boys and
girls
welcome to another stream i'm sad to say
that
the zumpo wasn't really running we

[00:45]
the zumpo wasn't really running we
played
we're playing some 1020 and
i actually have on the other table
it's on 510 so it's a little bit
something different it looks like
than normal but hey

[01:03]
than normal but hey
what can we do
nine ten ten boards i
actually expect quite a lot of check

[01:15]
actually expect quite a lot of check
raises here but i'm still going to bet
this exact hand i can easily call a
check race
and there's a lot of turns that i can be
calling on we're gonna turn i should
definitely be barreling

[01:32]
and i think this sizing is fine it's the
sizing that i think a lot of his
check coverings on the flop we'll have
some trouble
with against
we're gonna river this is a good sizing

[01:46]
we're gonna river this is a good sizing
i think we can still
uh i mean i think it's most likely range
is just having a nine
so i think betting too big will just be
quite bad for a nine

[02:01]
near the bottom we got a three bed with
ace queen
interesting if he barrels
i'm not really sure who this guy is i
think i'm gonna
rip it in we block king queen suited we

[02:15]
rip it in we block king queen suited we
block a skin we block aces we don't
block any of the flush draws
his barrel range usually has life cards
i think we have a lot of trouble calling
down
we will sometimes uncorrectly fold the
best hand so i think just jamming it in
now is fine

[02:30]
now is fine
and then he sometimes calls with a
rushflows draw
like now
thank you sir thank you very much
thank you very much where is it this one
i was looking for

[02:45]
i was looking for
[Music]
here i got check two on queen queen
deuce it's a little bit of a suspicious
check in my opinion
uh so i decided to
check back i don't think i'm gonna do
much to any betting basically the deuce

[03:01]
much to any betting basically the deuce
doesn't really hit me i think actually
on the turn i'm gonna make a race
and on the river i'm definitely betting

[03:19]
and on the river i'm definitely betting
the sizing not go too big i think this
is probably fine
interesting right what is he checking
the flop with

[03:31]
the flop with
what is he checking the flop with that
he now suddenly has
we have the nine of hearts at nine a
hard actually believe it or not it's
actually quite a good card
in terms of i think jack nine of hearts

[03:45]
in terms of i think jack nine of hearts
for example could definitely check flop
but then again jack then hearts as well
would he bet like an ace
a club jack or ace a heart 10 or
something on the turn
i think that is reasonable

[04:04]
i think we have to call it off but i'm
not very happy about it
okay gg
and he's gone the flop

[04:15]
and he's gone the flop
that's a good turn and we have kings
here let's see if we can win our money
back make a little forward
he checked here with this queen

[04:31]
he checked here with this queen
i'm gonna bet
here we also actually have quite a
decent hand i would say

[04:49]
we have actually good hands everywhere
got a call gonna be owen on the river
he folded that with the ice queen

[05:03]
hey mr daniel what do you think of this
my friend
come on give us that 10 20 money give us
that 10 20 money iphone
okay we gotta get phases three bet sure

[05:16]
okay we gotta get phases three bet sure
just called four bet
this would actually then be the hand
that is
this is gonna be it guys this is gonna
be a make or break moment i think with
the seven deuce
ah they fall i just show them drums

[05:34]
ah they fall i just show them drums
for poker like bring some fun enjoyment
that's good for the 7d score
guys we picked up how many big plans did
we pick up there how many big ones did
and that's 80 bucks i we're in the plus

[05:46]
and that's 80 bucks i we're in the plus
guys
97 deuce played and we're definitely in
the plus after this end
that was that was the moment that if you
would go forward man we were down so
many piglets at the seven deuce
and we would basically have to go
bananas there was just no other way

[06:01]
bananas there was just no other way
but to go bananas
what are you gonna do my friends
what you gonna do what you gonna do when

[06:16]
what you gonna do what you gonna do when
aces come to you
it's a very uh interesting board
i'm gonna go all in that is my plan

[06:32]
i'm gonna go all in that is my plan
what do you guys make of this plan we're
quite deep actually
maybe actually this is a bit too much
for this stack size for this
restack depth

[06:45]
but he he nicely calls there with the
tan jack
then jake ain't good my friend ain't
good my friend dan jack ain't good my
friend
then jack ain't good you just had a

[07:00]
then jack ain't good you just had a
naked flush drill
is farm checking behind the water dude
it gets better
that's a semi better
still no need in embedding if he checks
to us
no need for betting sorry come on

[07:16]
no need for betting sorry come on
four four four four four
three i'm pretty happy with the three as
well
what does this guy have nines nice a bit
loose
tense that's an option is king

[07:32]
tense that's an option is king
what are you thinking about
what do you think i was thinking about
jamming the [ __ ]
the [ __ ] thought about jamming

[07:47]
okay
yeah okay well plate not really sure
what he had but
we got the co cards and we almost made a
very good hand
oh here i see that the flop make trips

[08:01]
oh here i see that the flop make trips
on turn trips unturned is a good hand
rail turn
calls interesting river
i'm going to go for a little

[08:21]
first an ace in the vacuum don't really
want a bad small but he thought about it
for quite a while on the turn
i thought there was still a chance he
would have had like king jack king queen

[08:31]
would have had like king jack king queen
jack queen
or just a five and basically if you bet
small you know you
can still give him the chance of doing
something stupid well we have a seven
deuce here guys
let's open the seven deuce

[08:47]
let's pump it up with the seven dudes
you're [ __ ] full guys not bad not bad
flushing
we're flushing
actually going to check back

[09:01]
and go for a little delayed sea bed
i think on the river i have to sort of
bet again because i think he can still
be check calling the turn with a hand

[09:17]
that
he's always folding the river with oh
but he had an ace oh
that's that's expensive guys for the bb
100 for our seven deuce
that is expensive basically on the river

[09:31]
that is expensive basically on the river
like i said he's a bit passive so on the
river i think
i think pinky can still have 10 8 queen
10 king queen king 10
type of holdings flasher himself maybe
maybe czech falls in nine on the river
so i think it's a mandatory bluff but

[09:46]
so i think it's a mandatory bluff but
unfortunately
beyond a seven that's 50.
[Music]
getting close again god damn it getting
close again
oh we just get a gem i'm not happy about

[10:02]
oh we just get a gem i'm not happy about
this
but i think i have to go i assume this
is never acer king so
yeah flipping
the guy is i don't know what he is

[10:16]
the guy is i don't know what he is
that's what he is
and what you gonna do what you gonna do
when they come for you
oh this is a good flop guy

[10:31]
actually going to bed healthbot uh
i think versus the recreational here is
going to defend sort of a similar range
turn is interesting bring some
connectivity which obviously i'm not
very happy about

[10:50]
but i think with ace jack particularly
we can just
keep on focusing on getting some money
in now

[11:03]
had a worse jack like jack queen king
jack i would actually consider checking
the turn i think that's a good play
but ace jack particularly i don't have a
spade i think i'm just gonna go for
failure yeah opened

[11:16]
failure yeah opened
uh the fish the recreational excuse my
french
limped i check back

[11:30]
or at least i race sorry i raced and
then that we saw this flop
and now that we're here i check back he
bets i'm going to go
it's a bad river in terms of losing
action

[11:45]
action
obviously not falling
and he turns over the casual jackson's
offsuit gg
ah flopping said god damn it and here we
actually also have quite a decent hand

[12:03]
that's a very good river unless he has
queen 10 of diamonds
then i want the bad beat jackpot
well obviously we're just gonna ship it
in i hope he also has an ace

[12:17]
or that he was bluffing me which
apparently it was
[Music]
let's go another one of these they they

[12:31]
let's go another one of these they they
just keep
ripping in ace king versus me that's
good you know every time is six percent
oh he cashed out so it's me against
pokerstars
oh hey at least this is this is this is
perfect man

[12:45]
perfect man
this is perfect the guy keeps all his
money and i
and i win i win a stack i'll make a
little check race here
with the bucket jacks
and definitely betting turn

[13:03]
and definitely betting river oh really
yes really
i think his most likely hand is probably
a 10.

[13:15]
we will have rivered like some jacks i
think a jack it's probably still good
for
a three-quarters type of bat sizing so i
think that's what i'm gonna go for
i don't think he has a set

[13:30]
i don't think he has a set
or something i would assume you raise
his turn
so i think if we have an overpair we can
just now bet big
injects usually three bets pre i think
it just has a 10 so if we would have
queen's kings asus i think this is good

[13:46]
queen's kings asus i think this is good
sizing
and it's a very bad river for him if he
has eights or something i mean don't
take the tax too seriously guys i mean i
i haven't played sample enough with

[14:01]
with most of these people to really give
you an accurate picture
this is based on like a small sample and
maybe a couple of hands that i've seen

[14:24]
okay the guy calls out this is a dream
spot for him to jam
that money in the part of this guy

[14:32]
that money in the part of this guy
and there's already 50 60
i would jam a lot if i'm him actually
calls
i don't think i don't think the range

[14:45]
i don't think i don't think the range
that opens and calls something
is ever going to fall to this 12th big
blind bat so that's what i'm going to do
he jams we happily call it off when he
has a screen suit
hold or cash out and then hold
i wish you would have cast out and hold
it which we were packing aces on the

[15:02]
it which we were packing aces on the
other table
and that is a good flop for z pocket
aces

[15:21]
you know you know guys this is a helmuth
rap
i'm actually going to apply the helmut
trap one more time

[15:43]
make a very bad meanwhile we made a

[15:45]
make a very bad meanwhile we made a
little format here with the ace king
james good luck hey now we're actually
in the other way
oh it's fair if i would lose both
but hey i take it if we split it i

[16:01]
but hey i take it if we split it i
definitely take it
and happily stacking up versus pocket
king pocket jacks
win one

[16:18]
win two okay okay guys
to finish it off with here we run
i wouldn't even puffy here i mean we
were winning flips

[16:30]
were winning flips
flips left and right yeah
