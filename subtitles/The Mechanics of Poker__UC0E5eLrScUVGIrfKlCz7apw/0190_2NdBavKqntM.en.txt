[00:00]
you have to be detached a certain extent
from losing money otherwise you just
couldn't perform well in those games and
I think having that very swingy start
where I lost all of my money multiple
times helped develop that quite quickly
which I think you need to play the

[00:15]
which I think you need to play the
higher
Stakes I mean I I think at the beginning
I actually wasn't good at it I I don't
really know what the Baseline is or what
the average person has with respect to
that but I was I remember being not good
at Zoom I remember always like playing
for tables of zoom and just kind of like

[00:32]
for tables of zoom and just kind of like
losing a three bet pot and checking my
balance like you know like seeing how
the session is going all the time when I
would never do that now and it shouldn't
matter I think a lot of it for me was
just experience just it just happens so

[00:45]
just experience just it just happens so
much that you just kind
of gradually get used to it like you
know when I was first
playing Five Cents 10 cents Zoom if I
lost $10 I would be really annoyed but
then like when you're playing

[01:00]
then like when you're playing
100 NL losing $10 doesn't annoy you
anymore and I think that just like
happens naturally throughout the stakes
and then once you've been at a certain
stake for long enough you just know it
that's how it works um with the biggest
stuff I

[01:15]
stuff I
think playing it a lot
helps um you're generally around a lot
of people who also view it the same way
it's just like you're playing tough
people and losing is part of it and you
know everyone or most people treat it

[01:30]
know everyone or most people treat it
like that and then for
me like selling action
when I do for the big
games having people who also treat it
like that as investors because there are

[01:46]
like that as investors because there are
some investors that I sold to in the
past who actually I mean I've had some
bad experiences but not as many but I've
had friends who have like played a bad
handing games and then been asked for
the money back from the investors

[02:00]
the money back from the investors
because and it was usually from like
people they didn't know that well people
selling on Facebook
or you know people who aren't like poker
Pros themselves maybe and people like oh
I invested in you because I thought you
were good but you like you played this

[02:15]
were good but you like you played this
like bad hand in my view can I have my
money back because I was like I didn't
want to invest in you if you play like
that uh and I think obviously like
that's the the extreme but the other
extreme is having who really don't care

[02:31]
extreme is having who really don't care
and who are just like I think you're
going a poker that doesn't mean you
won't make mistakes and you can either
lose because of luck or you can lose
because you made a mistake and that's
just how poker is and I don't care so
like here's the money and I'm never
going to talk you about it

[02:46]
going to talk you about it
again um so I think for the like highest
Stakes that helps as well because that
really takes the pressure off where you
don't feel like oh If I Lose I'm going
to have to you know explain to this
person why I lost or explain to this

[03:00]
person why I lost or explain to this
person that like sorry but you know I
don't have the money for you and you
know I'm sorry if that's a big deal for
you yes I got a few things there from
that one was the exposure itself playing
the games more frequently almost like
building tolerance for playing certain

[03:15]
building tolerance for playing certain
games all of a sudden it becomes the
norm so to speak obviously I'm guessing
some of the high rollers and the super
high rollers it's hard to build enough
of a sample at some of those Stakes to
kind of get that feeling but over time
like exposing yourself to the same
stimulus in terms of buying over time
you get used to it becomes normalized so

[03:30]
you get used to it becomes normalized so
to speak and the second thing you
mentioned was that can Investor's
mindset where most of the people go
around are similar in terms of their
they treat each buying his Investments
then you got other people buying action
who are also investing in um your career
or your your tournaments and again they
treat it like uh yeah an investment sort

[03:46]
treat it like uh yeah an investment sort
of mindset so they know the risk
involved and they're not expecting like
return so you've got this around other
people who are also yeah similar minded
and then you've got other people from
the outside who might be invest in who
are basically allowing you to uh just
play poker without the pressure

[04:00]
play poker without the pressure
I'm interested to know if you have a
different score card that you keep track
of because I'm thinking if someone's
trying to detach thems from results it's
quite hard when the results are very big
so for example let's say you're only
going to play a handful of 100ks or 250k
in a year and let's say you we to lose
all those are going bad variant in those

[04:15]
all those are going bad variant in those
games if the score card was just
Financial there's a very good chance
that you could be yeah losing that year
so to speak so I'm Wonder for yourself
like when you do play the higher buying
like overall when you play in your
career do you have a different scorecard
something that you judge your
performance B on which isn't um a

[04:31]
performance B on which isn't um a
monetary metric or a results
metric uh yeah I mean it is hard to not
have the money thing at all because that
is you know the kind
of first thing you see in your results

[04:45]
of first thing you see in your results
and if you just never one you would have
to stop
playing
um other than
that I mean you and you do have to look
at that because there are certain things
where you know you need to know

[05:00]
where you know you need to know
which games you're playing what you
think your Roi is and how many games
you're playing and what your win and
losses are because there is a certain
point where maybe
you're
like losing so much over a certain
amount of games that you're likely just

[05:15]
amount of games that you're likely just
not winning in those so you do you know
you can't just say like the aim is to be
detached from money in the sense that
emotionally you don't want to be
thinking about the money when you're
playing but you can't detach and just
never look at it because that is what
tells you whether you're winning or not

[05:31]
tells you whether you're winning or not
um the other things I think is just I
kind of generally have a feel maybe for
how I'm playing and if I'm getting
better in terms of when you review just
like how many big mistakes you make um

[05:45]
like how many big mistakes you make um
and
[Music]
then I guess people you play with as
well like you know people that you can
swap with maybe
change
uh people who will invest in you the

[06:00]
uh people who will invest in you the
markup you offered for for games or like
how easy it is to sell you know I had
times in the past where when I was first
playing high rollers and you're like I
wanted to sell action and you're selling
like 5% of the time to some people who

[06:16]
like 5% of the time to some people who
maybe know you or maybe just want like a
little sweat even if they don't know
much about your poke
game and
then I've had you know and it was like
hard where you're kind of thinking okay
I want to keep 20% of myself and I've
now sold 12 people between 1 and 10% and

[06:34]
now sold 12 people between 1 and 10% and
that's
like quite tough so you you know maybe
sometimes you didn't sell enough and you
couldn't play and then I've had times
where once I had got or better I wanted
to play 100K

[06:46]
to play 100K
and have been offered like 350% of the
action and you're like then having to
choose who you sell it
to uh
and some of the people that I sell to

[07:01]
and some of the people that I sell to
are like also players so I think there
are like various things like that in how
I think I'm playing and how other people
think I'm playing there is quite a good
metric to go off even though it's I mean
maybe metrics wrong word it's not like

[07:17]
maybe metrics wrong word it's not like
measurable in any sense
[Music]
um yeah I think just like feeling like
I'm
improving um
is how I judge most of my kind of how I

[07:31]
is how I judge most of my kind of how I
feel about my pocal
progress yeah yeah I think that's quite
a lot of data points that you're using
there rather than just results like I
said to some degree the results are
always the end goal of what matters and
you can't switch off from that from a c
perspective but the emotional side I
think is a more important variable how

[07:46]
think is a more important variable how
do you almost like keep confidence
during bad patches when results are not
going your way so you have a lot of
different data points whether it's how
you feel about the games is other people
around you having confidence in your
game be a to sell action to to people
who have yeah trust your game so I think

[08:00]
who have yeah trust your game so I think
those things help to build confidence
let's say you wanted a bad run and let's
say you didn't have those data points to
look back on let's say you played a bad
tournament so to speak there was lots of
mistakes and the money values were going
in the whole so to speak on D swing how
do you feel like you would deal with
that emotionally is there anything

[08:15]
that emotionally is there anything
anything you would go to or if you were
a bit worried about your performance in
some of the higher games is there
anything you would do to kind of get
yourself out of that
situation uh yeah I think I think it was
2018 was very bad for me in terms of

[08:31]
2018 was very bad for me in terms of
money
and at the end of the year I just didn't
think I was playing well I was like
playing the high stakes more regularly
and kind
of it's hard to say because I haden't
been playing them as much so I was still
like more attached to the results

[08:47]
like more attached to the results
but I felt like maybe I shouldn't be
playing those games or wasn't as good as
I thought I was wasn't as high up in the
game as I thought and could feel that
like I lost a a lot of money and played

[09:00]
like I lost a a lot of money and played
some hands I was like okay this wasn't
like when I reviewed them was like this
is too many mistakes compared to I think
what other people are doing in those
games uh so I just took three months off
playing and just studied six days a week
at home and just didn't go on any live

[09:17]
at home and just didn't go on any live
stops I think I did like February March
April of that year and
then yeah I mean I must be getting the
dates
wrong or maybe but uh I could check on

[09:30]
wrong or maybe but uh I could check on
Hender maybe but um that was before
Vegas
2019 so yeah it would have been a few
months at the start of that
year um and I I think that like that
is for me all I can really do in those

[09:48]
is for me all I can really do in those
situations emotionally it's nice to give
yourself a break because losing and
feeling like you're making mistakes It's
Kind stressful to lose money and then
for me it's more stressful than the
money Mone to be making mistakes and

[10:00]
money Mone to be making mistakes and
stuff because I'm just competitive and
didn't want to be not playing well so
it's nice to give your brain a reset
because I think there's just a c only a
certain amount of that stress you can
take before you just burn out
emotionally and then you know at the end

[10:15]
emotionally and then you know at the end
of the day if you're not playing well or
you think you're
not a big enough winner in your games to
make it worth it like the time and the
gambling the only like long term
solution is get better

[10:31]
solution is get better
so I was just like either I can keep
playing and postponing the getting
better or do it really slowly and
probably have more pain or I can just go
away hopefully turn my like 2% Roi into

[10:45]
away hopefully turn my like 2% Roi into
6% or something and then come back when
it's six rather than trying to grind it
from like two to six whilst
playing uh so I think like if I had the
same now that's I would just do the same
stuff I mean
in between now if I have a trip that I

[11:02]
in between now if I have a trip that I
don't think I play that well
on I just go home and study more hours
than
usual yeah perfect this was it this was
the skill I was looking for because I

[11:15]
the skill I was looking for because I
knew you must have something in place
that balances the kind of playing the
high role as taking a lot of risk that
when things don't go well and you feel a
little bit out of your dep though your
game doesn't feel quite as sharp as you
wanted to be there must be something you
fall back on to get you through those
patches that's very
adaptive and for you it's this kind of

[11:31]
adaptive and for you it's this kind of
remove yourself from the games in that
example you you been three months
studying and I like the kind of
Simplicity of just get better I just had
to get better and I really I can tell
from yourself you've got a good inbu of
feel at least you trust your feels and
in those moments rather than the loose

[11:45]
in those moments rather than the loose
I'm sure the losing was painful but it
was more like you felt that you were
making more mistakes than you should
have been and that created a pain point
and that pain Point LED you to go right
I need to study more I need to work on
my game I'm going to stop playing those
games for a period and come back a
better version of myself I think that's
the key an ingredient where it's almost

[12:00]
the key an ingredient where it's almost
like if I'm not good enough now I'll get
better and come back again so it's like
this ability to uh navigate your space
in terms of it's not absolute like said
the games are too tough for you that
period if the world weren't but then you
just got better and I think that's the
yeah the kind of key Inc that allows you

[12:15]
yeah the kind of key Inc that allows you
to keep coming back and playing these
high stakes when other players might
crumble when results went going their
way all right I was just going to say
quickly I think like
[Music]
switching maybe like

[12:31]
shortterm like shortterm past
experiences
[Music]
to uh to be put like fully in the past
quickly is very useful in those just
like if you were losing even if it was

[12:46]
like if you were losing even if it was
for an extended period of time and you
were losing for six
months it's very hard to put that behind
you uh or for me it used to be a lot
harder but I think seeing things as just
like okay that happened in the past and
now like the only thing I have to choose

[13:01]
now like the only thing I have to choose
is the future
year uh and like separating those very
quickly it's being like okay yeah maybe
I shouldn't have been playing those
games the last six months do I want to
play them the next six months and what
do I have to do to make that not a bad

[13:15]
do I have to do to make that not a bad
decision and then like forget about the
six months where you shouldn't have done
and just been like okay that was a
mistake I made in the past and I just
can be like a different person
now how do you move on quickly in those
scenarios because how powerful that
skill set is but at the same time I know

[13:31]
skill set is but at the same time I know
a lot of people struggle with the the
story narrative let's say about six
months that six months creates a little
bit of a repetitive story of why they do
this it's going badly is things going to
turn around how do you like almost like
draw a line and cut that story off and
be very present oriented in future
Orient is there anything any skills

[13:46]
Orient is there anything any skills
you've developed to help you kind of see
forward rather than looking
back
uh I guess it would just be the same
that I said before of just like changing
habits if if you feel like you know
you're losing and you don't want to be

[14:01]
you're losing and you don't want to be
just do something different I guess so
that you don't feel like you're doing
the same thing because I think that's
the for me that's the scary thing with
the gambling
where you know there's no one to stop
you in poker there's no person who's

[14:16]
you in poker there's no person who's
going to come and be like hey you lost
half your role like stop like maybe you
have friends that do that but a lot of
people don't or maybe you don't want to
tell people and it's scary knowing that
like if you carry on the same you could
just lose everything
uh so I think I don't know about other

[14:32]
uh so I think I don't know about other
people but for me that is one of
the worries in those
situations so I would just do that and
just okay I'm losing I'm just going to
change my habits completely so I don't

[14:45]
change my habits completely so I don't
feel like I'm in the same narrative like
I'm gonna study really hard and then
come back and play slightly lower games
or take slightly bigger pieces until I
feel confident again uh
[Music]

[15:01]
[Music]
and yeah I I think the same thing like
in the past if I was if I had habits on
trips that I thought weren't helping
and you know at some point you just say
okay I'm not going to do that anymore

[15:16]
okay I'm not going to do that anymore
and I think that helps me personally
move on quite quickly because as soon as
you cut that thing out that you think
was negatively affecting
you you feel different quite quickly you
feel like oh I'm not I'm not doing the
same thing so it's like this is like a

[15:31]
same thing so it's like this is like a
different set now it's not like a
continuation of the same sample it's
just like those thousand games were I
was doing that and like these next
thousand games I'm going to do something
different so it's like a new
