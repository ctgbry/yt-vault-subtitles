what do you think the highest rim rate
obtainable over a large sample at 500
zoom this really depends but i
would say um
and we are back and
live
got myself some nice
it's not hot chocolate guys don't get
food by the cup
some nice matcha green tea and a nice
piece of chocolate
90 so adam carmichael approved
and it's already been all right it's
been a month i think
i actually had to rush in here as you
can see we start a little bit late
as i lock myself out of my apartment so
i'm actually
very glad that i managed to sort of get
back in time before we
get into all the goodness of today's
session
another 500 zoom session i haven't
played in a month
not a single hand haven't prepared
whatsoever as i was locked out
which is actually brings me to a couple
of points actually that i wanted to
highlight on before we start
mainly what do you do after you've been
away
for quite a while from the poker tables
this is probably a little bit more of
advice to the more professional poker
players
you know that feeling when you go away
for three four months you come back and
you think kind of that you forgot how
the game
is played do you even know the rules you
sometimes might ask yourself
and i have a couple of tips for that tip
number one
see this as an opportunity and what i
mean with that is
if you've been away for quite a long
time like me in this session
a good chance is that your c game is
going to show
up okay you're not in the routine of
playing so you will
not be in the flow which is actually a
good thing because tendencies that come
up in your c
game or b game are actually the things
that have not yet been mastered until
the point as
jared tendler likes to call it
unconscious competence which basically
means
you can execute it without even having
to think about it so basically
the leaks that now will kind of show up
while playing are the leaks that
you can work on that will significantly
increase your win rate so that's tip
number one don't go back and prepare for
like three days because then your c
again doesn't show up and you missed a
valid opportunity
which brings me actually to tip number
two expectations
uh basically all tilt and all your
frustrations in life are kind of linked
to having
unrealistic expectations sometimes
people think when they're back
that they're going to perform exactly
the same as
one month ago in my case when i left the
tables
i can already tell you that that's not
going to happen so if you have the
expectation that you're going to play
well and then you get struck by reality
which is you are going to not know what
to do in certain spots or you're going
to make mistakes
that are kind of normal as this is your
c game but if your expectations are not
aligned that will create tilt whereas if
you basically expect
to play bad you could say the chances of
you
tilting because of a bad play are less
which actually makes it way more likely
for you to get into the flow later in
that session
okay very important in general aligning
expectations
is something that i think is very
important for your mental game
i have more so expectations because i
had to rush in this
elsa would have written everything down
what was the other point
oh yeah another point this is actually
something that you can do before you
leave
is if you're in a good flow but you have
to go away for a couple weeks you cannot
play for a couple weeks
before you leave record a video to
yourself
and show a couple of hands and remind
yourself
what make you made to perform this well
in the last couple of weeks it's kind of
like a welcome back
videos last presentation you do to your
future self in three weeks
i have made various over my poke career
and then when i'm back it's like
hey mr wacko we had a lot of fun we were
crushing at the tables and this is why
okay sometimes you can kind of forget
especially if you've been
absent for around three weeks
or longer and i think that is probably
about
it so we're gonna go in without
any expectations any preparation so this
is like
c d e f game showing up so actually i'm
i'm as curious as you guys to see
what is gonna show up so
let's without further ado let's get into
it
maybe we should go to the poster site
and look up the rules
tunas making big stacks tunis what did i
tell you man
you have to play together if you take
all the money then there's nothing
anymore left for the wrestle you know
play a little bit social give some money
back to the rest
so they can also have some money to play
with squeezing pocket tents here
against brickie and mr flu
[Music]
quit waking me with whacking me is that
is that a new term bricky
did we just introduce a new term
whacking
all right i'll make a tight fold there
using this kind of device i prefer to
have a little bit of a higher hand
oh duh or a lower hand
whacking shall we keep that in guys
actually i have a good hand now which is
the ace king suited
now we got four bed
suited i'm okay usually getting it in
with
but a bit earlier i mean people are a
little bit tighter
and no reason to race the turn is not
really a spot that we're going to do a
lot of
betting as i think
he is probably going to be doing quite a
lot of checking as well
and you know then people just bluff off
stacks that's how it goes
trips um
oh no you're not
i am
chocolate
remember last time on this board that we
had trips
close your eyes and imagine for a second
that we just have trips again
oh not a great turn for trips but
you know
let's see sizing
that's that big guys let's just go big
and he falls
this was the power of imagination
i was dealt six seven but we closed our
eyes
imagined we had a four and then you just
ask yourself what would i do if i had a
four
and then you execute
and forget your current hand for a
little moment
so this is the tip of the day now
everyone goes
play poker with their eyes shot and
think they have aces all the time do
remember guys if you have to turn over
your hand
that you can visualize all you want
but then it's not going to change
ah that's let's trap let's trap guys
let's just throw out a little trap here
let's let's be tricky let me see what he
does with the pot
he checks
well let's just let's throw out a little
step
check race come on mr jungle rush you
can do it
and then we're going to pretend like we
have a decision
cauli collier with the seven eight
suited oh what he does check rice
he has no clue
but i trapped him and we're gonna trap
him again
mew actually was a flop of flush two
good hands here
flush
i'm gonna play it slow again this one is
actually now quite interesting
i think with this exact hand we should
just focus on betting
should we yeah so
this board runs out really shitty for us
i think we should probably bet the river
though
off pot
now let's hope it doesn't have queens
i have affinity as kings and he's got a
time call
oh he has 41 seconds to do that
come on sir we're on stream don't take
42 seconds to call with kings come on
okay he has taken 42 seconds to call it
kings oh
jesus i'm a [ __ ] psychic
we're really what do you think the
highest win rate
obtainable over a large sample at 500
zoom this
really depends but i would say
what is the highest win rate let's see
if you this really depends on your
approach and i'm not
and this goes beyond how good of a
player are you
but i would say eight nine
some tennis ten somewhere around that
region i would say
somewhere between eight to ten
and then you're gonna say well i know no
one who makes that no because people
don't
approach it in this way
most people i think if you're very good
most i think most good
very good 500 zoom players probably get
stuck at six front of my head
five four six five four
but that's i think because their
approach isn't necessarily the best
he checks
could bet this hand i think i'm gonna
bet this hand
probably checking the river it's a
three-bet pot
are we gonna check the river actually
queens i would definitely bet
could be a bit loose but let's try it
here he snap called me
with the king 9 i think that's like the
probably the only
king he checks the turn with right
yes yeah i think so i think it's way
more likely he has a hand
i think queens checks i think a
10 or like ace queen is probably a more
likely holding for him so i
think my gem is okay mr jungle roars has
nice hand
yeah i mean it was quite unlucky
erase the flop that's the turn quite
interesting
ass doesn't have that many value
combinations
let's actually consider dunking the turn
could actually be a thing depending on
his strategy
[Music]
i don't think i played this hand really
well to be honest i think i actually
should have done better turn
yeah i think i played this hand quite
badly
definitely didn't play this hand that
well
he now goes all in yeah i think we
have quite a good hand
i mean if he has a7 then gg
a7 gg sir mr jungle wars
but in general i think i misplayed that
[Music]
hand
you
