yes yes yes guys that is what you call a
good hand i agree
my friend you also the path but not as
good as me
do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a
free one hour demo what's up what's up
what's
up party peeps
or poker fans let's just start off
show me the start of the stream with a
little gem i already know what this guy
is but
can be bad let's just start with the the
the stream with the gem why not
is king flip win oh no queens uh oh
oh oh
six oh my god it's a good start of the
stream guys good start of the stream
got a little three with him with bucket
eights and we're three betting the a's
jack
face a little c but here with the pocket
eights we are happily continuing
we're gonna turn an eight it's not an
eight
should you feel like eight is a hand i
should continue versus the barrel
tough spots to defend here but i think
eights particularly
like sevens eights are fine hands
interesting river interesting river
he should not be trapping up should he
be checking a king
am i gonna bat a queen
you feel like actually i can even put a
queen in a tough spot i think i
perceived to fold quite a lot of pocket
pairs already on a turn
if i have ace 3 i have ace high a's jack
have ace high i wouldn't bluff
so i don't think i have much bluster
actually
and like i said i think ace is already a
low frequency defend on the turn
nines is a fault 10's unfolding
if he decides to call good for him but i
don't think there will be much blast
here
but he does give us a sweat guys god
damn it come on man
take it easy okay it cannot be a bad
bluffy tanks it's always cybec you know
that that is always my principle
okay full whoa they don't want to lose
two bias straight away guys
what do you think of that play let me
see let me see what other people think
of that play
so here i'm the weko played his hand
perfectly in my opinion at least
he should also play it differently
sometimes but i think this is a really
fantastic line
do you consider lockbox as a good wreck
i consider
i consider basically all wrecks that
finally no zoom at the least good racks
else you won't be playing 5000
zoom here we got race on the river
ah that's not good huh that is not good
that is not good but i am curious what
about you guys
let's see he had the deuce nine
he had the those knife he had to do his
nine
buddy we gamble here and here
i also have a decent hand
[Music]
good flop
over a little 25
the water is boiling guys the water is
boiling
do you ever tilt of course i tilt man
i'm a human being
then i look at this girl then i think
why would i tell them life
huh no of course of course i told men
what kind of question is that but
less
okay get drawn a little race here
there's a block i think we still have to
call
oh no queen on the river
that would not have been a good idea for
for me it was to jump to 1k oh guys we
got a seven deuce
yeah yeah let's just go for it let's go
[Music]
april come on man just fold already
we don't have a big margin anymore else
you know we have to see bet oh it's just
four bets
i cannot ever go call four vets guys
it's it's getting close though
okay okay
okay okay okay face erase
ah you can have it my friend so far luck
hasn't really been involved i think all
the pots we won or lost were due to our
own
our own actions
come on gary tell a little squeeze
that should not have too many deuces but
you never know what it's at
we're a little bit deeper there's a
recreational here so
you could have deuces
oh what are you what are you thinking
about set wrong timing okay
i'll i'll check as well
why actually no i'm gonna block i think
that makes way more sense
in terms of for my range my actual hand
what the hell is going on here so hey
wait call check or bet
hey
you know that moment where you think
okay he's going to check i'm going to
barrel and then suddenly you see a bet
you're like
what that what the hell just happened ah
let's open the 53 why not why not
why not that's why not god damn it
i mean not now that we're in it though
now that we're in it right
now that we're in it let's get let's
let's cross some charlie look i'm lucky
yes yeah we got a pair
counts while we thought about the ace
king suited so we went for my hand and
did it
i was like okay [ __ ] it i'll open and it
was like okay [ __ ] it i'll call it
okay [ __ ] it i'll call i see that okay
[ __ ] it my stick is in
and then yeah
well we flop actually a king here in the
top i'll keep you guys
posted this one
[Music]
oh you should be doing a lot of check
jamming here
i think we don't care enough to not bet
if i had five six i would definitely
check calling the four but with
d8's jack a flopping flush draw ain't
bad in that in bad
good luck good luck hombre
he he he always has queens or kings here
but can we do anything else can we do
anything else
let me consider if i can do anything
else and just ship it in
i mean he's gonna ship it in on a seven
anyway yeah okay [ __ ] it
i always ask that but that's fine it's
fine
so we're flipping my
oh you're [ __ ] kidding me mine not
even once
not even once
is that a socially approved game i don't
get it
but no i are rarely to never play live
very limited live experience
very very very limited
and this guy here starts betting that's
fine that's good it's good it's good
so far so good so far so good
i call
and i do the i do the helmuth
does he have
yeah okay yeah now i'm gonna raise it in
huh
obviously i actually got another aces on
the other table
it's ace's time you guys have a tough
tough decision here
let's hope he has an eight that's my
strategy
okay false
off with kings kings versus queens now
that's now that's good
now that's some good news god damn it
okay fair quartz i don't mind losing
against quartzer
i don't know about the the the
on party what do you think about zuma
party i
have no clue
what do i know i don't
i got a little puppet here on the river
thank you very much sir
called the wood split he called with oh
is it this is worse than a split
wait okay could this be worse than a
split nah
[Music]
probably not right oh guys long time no
longer i feel like that we have flopped
a set
no set no bad guys no set no bet
okay okay okay mr angelo you sure mate
are you sure might
actually i got three good hands now let
me zoom out got an ace king here with a
four bed
let's call this one got quads now
quads ain't bad jack 10 high flop
i'm gonna go for the flop jam why not
i'm all in in one table
get snap caught by ace jack that's very
unfortunate
but we make a straight then we face an
over bed here
um
i guess i'm gonna jam horse
and forces a fine hand to jam
we got some money with the 67
we got aces on the other table goddammit
guys i love action i'll zoom out again
hey fault okay thought about it for a
little while and decided to fault
go okay okay yes yes yes
guys that is what you call a good hand i
agree
my friend you also depend but not as
good as me
with four four or four
i still don't remember what he's talking
about with the four four
three four deuce ah
had you cooked
i had four or five oh yeah that that is
a little bit disappointing
good fault good fold man respect
and expect for the default
okay okay
called me there it's good i thought
there are some human solvers the human
silvers are doing its work
i may actually make a bad play here down
am i going to get punished by this bad
bad delayed seabed should not have
delayed seabed at this hand
punish me lane no
it's play style not good bad thank you
guys we flopped the set
dino might not know it yet but we
flopped the set
[Music]
love your content youtube my friend
thank you very much mr fizz buffet
like i said unfortunately i'm just about
to quit my session we stream for 2 hours
and 50 minutes
if the new joint followers want to check
out
a echo show every monday
around four and every thursday around
four
and but then actually i turned to four
so yeah i figured we certainly don't
have a set anymore you know this goes on
the record show you sometimes have a set
and then it's
the hand chains with the board change
and then we decide we don't have a set
anymore
psycho river was actually the jack of
hearts and i decided to actually front
but
decided to go for this sizing
in a vacuum in your hand you could just
think hey i have flush eye all in
that's an option good hand big bet but
like if i have a bluffer it's a hand
like six
five or pocket eights like i don't
really have a
a bluff here with it with a great
blocker
two flushes so if i would bluff it would
be that hand and i don't think i can
just rip my stack in so i thought this
was the biggest sizing i could go for
i think now at this end obviously he
wouldn't have checked behind but any
other overpower i think so
i still keep here give him the option no
i want to say i'm making a bluff ah
i didn't need a supremo you never know
uh but he got me here with the jacks
mechanics is super expensive yeah mate
and super good
that's what we need to focus on i hope
