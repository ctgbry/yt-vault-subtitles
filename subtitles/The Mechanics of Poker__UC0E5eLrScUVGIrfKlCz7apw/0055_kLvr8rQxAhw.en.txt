[00:00]
i'm gonna jam the turn
that timing it felt like he just he's
gonna have
like nines or something or jacquin
suited
or maybe 10 jack suited queen 10 suited
something like that
i'm putting it on putting him on and not

[00:17]
i'm putting it on putting him on and not
so much on aces or kings i think acer
kings play their hand a little bit
faster
they actually fold it very funky and i
have no clue

[00:32]
do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo hello boys
and girls we are here straight from the
start

[00:45]
start
which means that i'm now talking and
nobody is listening
normally we have a little intro but i
was busy playing
while we open here with the pocket fives
there's mr german
jeremy as you can see no longer 500 l
zoom
i'm moving up together with the german

[01:01]
i'm moving up together with the german
not hunting not hunting
okay turn spot is
close with exactly fives

[01:15]
debating a small bat or a big bat i'm
actually going to go for a small bed
again with fives
to turn around i'm gonna be doing some
splitting big bad small bet
i don't mind putting fives in my small
bed

[01:33]
the river is actually a spot where i'm
probably gonna do quite some small
betting again
gonna go for an over bet is exactly hand
let's see what the jared thinks of that
oh and then he raises all in

[01:47]
oh and then he raises all in
which is a legit option that could be
happening here
but instead he calls him mux and he had

[02:01]
but instead he calls him mux and he had
king
jack which is a fine call
as he's blocking a straight he's
blocking two pairs it seems like on this
table the
recreation has lost some money with
jack knight awesome okay this guy this

[02:16]
jack knight awesome okay this guy this
guy came here to
to crash the party so
oh but then he does cash out for
i i didn't get this one this is not in
line

[02:30]
line
uh with what i expected
to him to do
that's really weird we'll open pocket
fours

[02:45]
pocket fours pocket sixes and that's
quite a decent flop i would say for
pocket sixes
i'm gonna start off with a seabed
i'm gonna bet this board at a super high
frequency

[03:02]
could also check this hand
it's actually i'm gonna do now

[03:15]
with a diamond in my hand and here
actually i'm gonna make a very small bet
i think
yeah like a very small bit
and here i'm gonna call as well

[03:34]
it's a lot of action recreational bets
again on the river
on table two but

[03:46]
on table two but
i think we kind of have to
call trying to think if
king jack or king 10 is better
it kind of depends yeah

[04:02]
it kind of depends yeah
don't think we're gonna fold the top
pair our favorite hand
a little through it with our favorite
hand
not fold into a four bet unless it jams

[04:15]
not fold into a four bet unless it jams
oh it's a little bit of a bigger sizing
is it
22 months it's on a little bit bigger
size
people can really exploit me when i have
five four suited as i'm just never
folding and this is literally
one of the worst flops as we have five

[04:32]
one of the worst flops as we have five
high
without any potential
not completely true there is a backdoor
sort of straight draw
that we could see if we're very

[04:45]
that we could see if we're very
optimistic
but i'm just gonna fault
but not to miss a guy guys but not that
optimistic if i had hearts i would
definitely continue
so i could back a little back the

[05:00]
so i could back a little back the
flashlight to go with it i faced a
little race
this guy here from the ukraine
blah blah blah blah blah blah
i'm going to continue by calling
interesting turn

[05:15]
interesting turn
and this turn is way better for me than
it is for him assuming that he's not
raising too much flush draws or it's
like 10 jack because there are fine
calls
i'm gonna check

[05:31]
don't think i can continue versus a
barrel without a diamond
it's close
actually i think i will continue versus
bro

[05:47]
as you can still have maybe like a hand
like six seven with a diamond 10-7 with
a diamond jack 7 with a diameter
something funky like
in those regions
the river i think we have a check

[06:01]
really yes really

[06:19]
that's actually it's quite interesting
he bets off pot
i think i'm going to race

[06:54]
i like having a nine because it's less
likely like a variant that he could have
his king nine
with the king of diamonds i think that's

[07:01]
with the king of diamonds i think that's
a valid flop race for him
so we're blocking some we're blocking
that which i think is good
and i think he could maybe raise the
flop with like force with a diamond or
something
a very bad net now on the river that's
why i don't like hero calling

[07:15]
why i don't like hero calling
so yeah i like the way i played that
hand and battle awesome
10 20 with the big boys
and this guy here wants to tangle well i
have ace king suited my friend so it's a
very bad choice actually sometimes gonna
call this
and that sometimes is now in the mood

[07:30]
and that sometimes is now in the mood
i'm in the mood for calling
king 10 of
your face a big bet quite interesting

[07:46]
considering a race
that is even a thing
i'm gonna just race i have no clue if
this is a thing guys
i'm just gonna do it

[08:07]
this is very random
in my head it sort of makes sense so
let's see

[08:26]
let's see
he called okay it's quite
interesting i wasn't actually expecting

[08:31]
interesting i wasn't actually expecting
a call
i'm gonna jam the turn
that timing it felt like he just he's

[08:45]
that timing it felt like he just he's
gonna have
like nines or something or jacquin
suited
or maybe 10 jack suited queen 10 suited
something like that
i'm putting it on putting him on and not
so much on aces or kings i think acer
kings played their hand a little bit
faster

[09:00]
faster
he actually folded very funky and i have
no clue what to make of this to be
honest
but hey the hand got played well
we got some action action action action
action on the 10 20 streets guys

[09:16]
action on the 10 20 streets guys
10 [ __ ] 20. that's four times the
money
as in 500 zoom
can we already call this big boy stakes
i call it big boy steaks
i think from 10 20 for me it's

[09:30]
i think from 10 20 for me it's
considered high stakes so 10 20
plus i would say it's high stakes then
jack here betting turn
and i think we have good suits to

[09:46]
and i think we have good suits to
barrel the check is quite interesting

[10:01]
jack is quite interesting king 10 does
not make a straight
a block ace jack we do have
i don't think we have shown value
so i'm just gonna ship it in

[10:21]
we block ace 10 which i think is a good
call for him
he can have h4 h5 which i think are good
hands to be folding for him on the river

[10:38]
i don't think he tributes a lot of a6 a7
which would be good bluff catchers but i
don't think he
has them so then ace eight a's nine

[10:47]
has them so then ace eight a's nine
could be okay bluff catchers
but yeah mainly i think he's gonna call
with ace jack ace ten
and i have ace jack at ace ten okay you
actually go without king queen
okay shout out to that guy

[11:01]
okay shout out to that guy
shout out to mr argentinian and here we
actually also turn quite nicely we
called asic suited in a small blind
check called the flop we turn
the nuts or did enough jinx it german
decides to barrel

[11:15]
decides to barrel
um i'm gonna fold with the ace ten
in case jack has a better hand and i
have a lot of pairs etc etc as i'm
already overfolding flopped quite hard

[11:35]
is it barrel nothing i'm gonna check
right here i'm just gonna keep
continue check calling i have to check
also quite wide here on the turn think

[11:45]
also quite wide here on the turn think
of hands like king queen for example

[12:08]
uh
eight nine off obviously he has an
advantage in that

[12:15]
but then again if he has ace nine eight
nine he also has ten nine
or ten eight so i'm just gonna
what am i going to do
often in my beat i don't think he bets

[12:31]
often in my beat i don't think he bets
the six himself on the flop for that
sizing
so that's sevens one two three
eight nine a little bit conservative
i'm just gonna call but it's a little

[12:46]
i'm just gonna call but it's a little
bit weak
and gem sets can i have to jam this up
in the history of the stream we've
definitely been a little bit tight in

[13:01]
definitely been a little bit tight in
some spots
so now in terms of value raising value
betting i'm trying to
calibrate a little bit better but it's
quite
dicey here also it's very hard for me to
show up with bloss

[13:16]
get through bet it's cold
but also sometimes four beds kind of
depends
i expect to get some big bets and i

[13:30]
i expect to get some big bets and i
think i'm gonna race this flop actually
regardless of the sizing half
pot one third he actually checks well
then i'm gonna bet myself
[Music]

[13:45]
[Music]
and if he has a better hand then we are
going broke
on the flop
and i will get to the check in a second
the chat in a second but it's been quite

[14:00]
busy
yeah he does go for the check race well
now it's basically just
good luck not very happy about this
situation
to be to be straight i think sometimes
he could have tense himself sometimes he
could have ace nine

[14:17]
could have ace nine
sometimes he could just have a bluff but
yeah i'm not very happy about this but i
don't think there's anything else we can
do that just jam
and he has kings

[14:35]
and we don't suck out which is
unfortunate this game has just gotten
four-handed well we have pocket kings

[14:50]
oh oh this is a good scenario guys
this is what they call a good scenario
i don't think we're gonna do anything

[15:00]
i don't think we're gonna do anything
else than having a
jam range so i'm just gonna do that and
hope they don't
hope lawyer play at least folds
okay and actually i'm gonna sit out
anyway
that's what they call a hit and run guys

[15:16]
that's what they call a hit and run guys
hit them run yes jacks
okay you guys were in good shape that's
not a good [ __ ] flop my friend
we're running it twice okay at least

[15:31]
bit too easy joins the table guys my
advice
get out of there this was actually the
first hand
of the stream which i said to you guys
that

[15:48]
okay which i told you guys
got tribute by the you see that at the
flop check check turn and i jammed the
river
and he had eight trees suited i tried to
start my stream

[16:00]
start my stream
on the flop but that didn't really work
out other than that we had
the call down with the king nine
which actually he went for
one third one third yeah

[16:16]
one third one third yeah
i was considering on the river what's
better to call with king thanking jack
and then was like actually i'm
just going to call down any king maybe
i thought about for a little while maybe
he felt now felt a little bit slow
rolled
in terms of pot loss we had plenty

[16:34]
yeah we had this one actually this one
was earlier i think before the stream
there's a limb re-race a four-bat
we get this flop and i don't didn't

[16:45]
we get this flop and i don't didn't
really know what to do if i don't have a
heart i don't think i'm gonna bet
but i figured with the heart and him
sometimes having tents
which i think in general is a good hand
that he should be calling with
he could maybe have had like eight seven
suited six seven suited
um

[17:02]
and basically i thought okay there's i
basically will always have some equity
so i decided to actually go for the gem
finish golden i was actually dead
because he had ace five of hearts then
we had
the all in that we chopped we had the

[17:17]
the all in that we chopped we had the
pocket
tents which was a little bit dicey
but one of these spots where you kind of
already know like okay
basically when you jam and he calls
you're not in good shape

[17:30]
you're not in good shape
but the thing is there's already 1.3 k
in the middle
so sometimes when you jam he's gonna
fold sometimes
when you jam he's going to call with
worse maybe then in this case he's not
suited
sometimes maybe with a combo draw or a
regular flush draw

[17:45]
regular flush draw
so yeah taking that in consideration uh
i think we have a jam
sometimes he stands himself but then he
will have the tents with the heart so
we're not doing that great
overall definitely not a printy spot

[18:01]
overall definitely not a printy spot
i would say on 10 20 against these two
guys that are willing to battle
i probably cannot fault you're playing a
little bit lower stakes
i think the check race here can be
definitely constructed way too
heavy and i think you should definitely
be watching out especially versus

[18:16]
be watching out especially versus
a bit more of your tighter more passive
opponents i would be very
hesitant to get my money in here on the
flop
so i wouldn't mind to make an
exploitative fool there for the passive
player
and then obviously we have the we we

[18:31]
and then obviously we have the we we
have the famous hero call
mr soy mi mama is the king queen
so far so good anything here on the turn
we could definitely be stabbing hands
like fours and fives

[18:45]
like fours and fives
fours and fives i think are mainly fives
and actually i'm opening all fours and
fives probably given the fact that
there's a recreational
three bat he didn't three but two that
big and we're a little bit deeper
maybe force usually i draw the line for

[19:01]
maybe force usually i draw the line for
myself with five so fives i will always
have
um i will definitely be able to step
that on the turn
irena river jack rolls off
i think for example he puts he maybe
also thinks it's more likely that i'll

[19:17]
also thinks it's more likely that i'll
bat jack then on the turn than king 10
and that i'm always betting the river
when i river a jack
so for example if i'm always betting the
river when i have a jack
but i think specific for example i don't

[19:31]
but i think specific for example i don't
like having king jack
because i don't think the king is very
very handy i mean actually it turned out
to be quite handy but i think a hand
that
is going to see where check call check
fault most of the time it's king's king
queen
i don't think blocking ace king is very

[19:46]
i don't think blocking ace king is very
relevant because he's usually burying
that himself on the turn
like i said h4 h5 i think there are also
his main fault so if i would have fives
i don't think we
would have blocked the river so yeah
then it's ace jack
uh it's queen his queen is just a very

[20:02]
uh it's queen his queen is just a very
a very big part of my range
but yeah definitely definitely a spot
that i could be over bluffing
um if he thinks that fives is in here as

[20:15]
um if he thinks that fives is in here as
well or king jack suited
in here as well but then again if i have
kinjac suited house of kingdom suited
right
but definitely not a spot versus your
average opponent that i would suggest
uh playing the hand the way he did but
hey he called me down and he won

[20:31]
hey he called me down and he won
so all respect to him so yeah i want to
thank you guys all for tuning in
don't forget to check out bennett beats
stream which is going to start
in about an hour i'm not 100 sure where
he's going to stream

[20:45]
he's going to stream
just keep an eye out poker he's going to
be talking about mental health and poker
and he's going to donate
all the donations that you guys can make
to charity
so go over there and donate some money
to the guy
i think mental health is something
that's very important

[21:00]
that's very important
for poker players as i mean there's
various stories right of poker players
kind of
uh getting a little bit depressed and
all
i don't know what what not but i think
actually this is not only for poker this
is uh

[21:15]
is uh
more life in general right when you're
being so obsessed about
trying to get very good in something um
yeah it's always it's always dan there's
always like some mental health issues
laying around the corner that you kind
of have to watch out for

[21:31]
of have to watch out for
so without further ado go to check that
out i will see you guys
back friday where we're gonna do kind of
the same concept i'll be playing
uh and then the end my stream will tune
in like i said i'm just gonna keep on
doing lap
[Music]

[21:45]
[Music]
let me know if you guys like
this format playing higher stakes or if
you say like hey listen i don't care
about the 500 zoom show
is nice because obviously gonna be a
little bit less entertaining i would say
because i'm

[22:00]
because i'm
a little bit more focused uh for example
i don't think we played much clips
um actually yeah right we played the
[ __ ] victor clip go back to the
bangko
all the time so that was that was that
ain't good uh if
if five of the hero calls that i made if

[22:15]
if five of the hero calls that i made if
one of them would have gone right we
would have played a nice little clip so
um
think you don't want to block six four
suited stickers suited five for suited
ace five five three with
the five six suited hand the five six
suited

[22:33]
oh yeah no
yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna have to take a
look at that but so yeah friday we will
be back
