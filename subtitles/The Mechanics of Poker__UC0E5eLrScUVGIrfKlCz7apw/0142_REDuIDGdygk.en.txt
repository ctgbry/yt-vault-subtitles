hi there my fellow poker enthusiasts and
welcome back to another episode of the

[01:00]
welcome back to another episode of the
mechanics of poker podcast today's guest
helps you decide where in your wardrobe
you should put your t-shirt underwear
and socks
he personally needed to create some
extra sprays in there for his poker
monsters purple jacket in which he won

[01:16]
monsters purple jacket in which he won
3.6 million dollars helping a net over
10 million dollars in tournament
earnings however he refers to himself
more as a cash game player which is
currently what he spends most of his
time on playing and coaching over at

[01:30]
time on playing and coaching over at
pokercoat.com i'm talking about the one
and only stefan guscore sondheimer
very popular guest on podcasts and for
good reason a lot of experience and
wisdom and very open in sharing and
giving tips to the audience
adam i know you have listened to a bunch

[01:47]
adam i know you have listened to a bunch
of his podcasts leading up to this one
what are you most curious about
for today's guest
yeah i'm very excited for today's guest
and i want to hear how he was able to
climb the ladder to play some of the

[02:00]
climb the ladder to play some of the
highest super rollers in the game and
then be able to come back to the cash
game games and play that lower almost
without any ego and i'm really curious
to know what lessons he's learned along
the way and he also seems very balanced
in terms of his approaches to uh having
a good life being very healthy he's very

[02:16]
a good life being very healthy he's very
health-conscious guy so yeah i'm really
interested to hear how he packages it
all together to become this well-rounded
individual as well as a very successful
pogba player so he has so many questions
on my mind which i'll save for a little
bit how about yourself renee what are
some of the main things you want to get

[02:30]
some of the main things you want to get
from our guest today
i've been doing some research myself as
well adam
dove into his poker code course and
learned a couple of things about the
dice principle the look-alike principle
so i have many many more questions to
ask mr sundimer especially you know he's

[02:46]
ask mr sundimer especially you know he's
rose through the ranks in both cash
games mtt so i'm sure he's learned a lot
and i'm very curious how he did it what
kind of things that he was doing how he
approached the game
so i would say without further ado let's
get stefan on
welcome to the pot stefan thank you for

[03:02]
welcome to the pot stefan thank you for
being on
yeah great to be here
so i think given my introduction of you
as a professional wardrobe builder we
left a lot of the listeners pretty
confused so before we start maybe you

[03:16]
confused so before we start maybe you
could explain to the listeners what you
mean with building a wardrobe
i mean uh that's like i don't know one
of my trademark uh teaching videos
actually so it's it's just like a way of

[03:30]
actually so it's it's just like a way of
thinking when when thinking about about
ranges in poker uh so yeah it's it's
really that whenever i play a hand i
want to give my
self options for and i was looking for
for an image to create where like i had

[03:45]
for an image to create where like i had
in mind how like my flatmate reiner
kempi always was living out of a
suitcase which you could already compare
it to to the range bed right just like
you have one place and everything has to
belong in there um and some others
wardrobes i had for example just like

[04:01]
wardrobes i had for example just like
three compartments um and some others
can look like very very crazy so uh to
all the solver geeks out there you you
play fancy crazy wardrobes which is
super tough to remember so uh this is
pretty much just my my analogy for for

[04:15]
pretty much just my my analogy for for
giving ourselves options first and then
once we have those options it makes it
just way way way easier to choose like
the right one for our
exact piece of clothing right it's like
okay if you have a
drawer for underwear and you find socks

[04:31]
drawer for underwear and you find socks
somewhere you know where they belong and
then
we had it actually before we started
recording that podcast already the most
important box or compartment to have is
the one where everything else has to go
into so that's just like the the most
necessary one um and then it's something

[04:47]
necessary one um and then it's something
like you can be a little creative and
build like uh fancy wardrobes every now
and then if you think it really
makes a difference or you can simplify
and just like play the the suitcase
strategy sometimes uh and this is yeah

[05:00]
strategy sometimes uh and this is yeah
this is what is a strategy is it all
about in in poker and in my wardrobes
i love it i love it i'm 100 sure no one
ever expected the podcast to start this
way so that's good so
i'm sure we will get back to that later

[05:15]
i'm sure we will get back to that later
later in the part where i'm very curious
uh about hearing more about your
teaching philosophy
um
going back to your story you've had big
successes both
live online cash games mtt's maybe even
sit and go spinning goes i don't know

[05:30]
sit and go spinning goes i don't know
but at least from what i wear of cash
games entities
up until the highest stakes well of
course just like everyone else you know
maybe people look at you think like oh
he's always been there but this did not
happen over time right i think you wrote

[05:45]
happen over time right i think you wrote
that it took you roughly five years to
get to the higher stakes which actually
compared to
people around me and people that we've
asked so far i would say it's actually
on the shorter side i often see six
seven maybe even eight so maybe also
curious to see why it took you a little

[06:01]
curious to see why it took you a little
bit shorter than others
um
i wanted to start off with a with a
quote
or at least actually i'm quoting you
here
i love being better at something than
others and i'm very competitive

[06:15]
others and i'm very competitive
okay now we me and adam we were
immediately very curious
when the first signs of this competitive
showed up i was imagining
young goose you know in kindergarten
trying to out build blocks with the
other kids trying to build bigger sand
castles was that kind of where it

[06:31]
castles was that kind of where it
started or
i mean i have to go back to um
me having an older brother i guess
and beating him was the major goal of
like anything that you could do so

[06:45]
like anything that you could do so
right now um i'm just remembering his
speech i got married this year and my
brother gave a nice speech
and um it was more like i mean we didn't
we weren't like living together or
seeing too often the last 10 years so he
was mainly including the parts of our
our childhood where we just spend all

[07:01]
our childhood where we just spend all
the time together
and uh
i just popping up in my mind is the
reaction of a good friend that uh that
he just told me after the speech and
like
i mean i know you're a cool guy he said
but
oh damn i'm so happy i didn't grow up in

[07:17]
oh damn i'm so happy i didn't grow up in
the sondheimer's house uh it's just like
yeah it's that that type of guy who no
one wants to play with anymore um just
like random board games um
yeah uh i don't know my mom probably

[07:30]
yeah uh i don't know my mom probably
still thinks that i'm just lucky but you
know it's like as poker is is like
carcassonne isn't the game of luck
either right like i i had like one one
other guy in the neighborhood who was
like similarly competitive and we were
like having those big lists for i don't

[07:46]
like having those big lists for i don't
know what's the english name for like
settlers of katan something like that uh
we i think it's like the score is still
like 253 to 227 in my favor like stuff
like that uh so it's really that the the
joy of really analyzing something that

[08:02]
joy of really analyzing something that
you can influence but it's just a game
for fun for others it's like
like that um so i think this started
mainly mainly board games um and
especially just like having an older
brother who just

[08:15]
brother who just
i mean naturally is ahead in anything to
start off with um but and that that
translates over transfers over to to
like school and anything so like i
wanted to be like better at reading
better at math better at anything like

[08:30]
better at math better at anything like
in that talking about like the age of
like five six when you like even before
school and stuff like that so this is
where i guess it all starts and um it's
just i don't know always was a driving
force
so fun family reunions with christmas
katong comes out and then it's like oh

[08:47]
katong comes out and then it's like oh
everybody wanted to win i don't know for
maybe maybe a little um a great game for
everyone who loves poker out there is a
camel cup did you ever hear of that
camo cup no i haven't that's actually
like you are following it's like it

[09:01]
like you are following it's like it
plays like the roles in egypt and it's
like a camel racing but you are not the
camel that is racing and you are like
rolling the dice or anything you're
actually uh
someone who is betting on how the race
ends and then there's like fancy
movements the camels can do but in the

[09:15]
movements the camels can do but in the
end it's just like ev equations and i'm
i think
it's very very low variance if you play
it really with um
sorry mom sorry dad with like really
really big whales right it's like i
think it's like i'm still like winning

[09:31]
think it's like i'm still like winning
19 out of 19 of those it's and it's like
we play four people so it should more be
like 25 win rate but uh this is a great
game for everyone who who likes beating
others
this remembers me of my christmas i
played the game coupe i don't know if

[09:46]
played the game coupe i don't know if
you know it c-o-u-p
i think
i'm not sure
it's a full-on bluffing game basically
and my initial read was my mom does not
bluff my dad however used a different
strategy where he was trying to pick up

[10:01]
strategy where he was trying to pick up
my mother's bluffs but obviously she
never bluffed which was quite obvious
so definitely typical not doing anything
yourself but then catching everything
it's like yeah
yes i mean i i started off bluffing
straight away i immediately knew my wife
my mom they would just never say you're

[10:16]
my mom they would just never say you're
bluffing so i would just go for the for
the biggest bluffs that i could find
straight away
and i was 100 sure that they were not
bluffing my dad was quite kamikaze in
his wardrobe he had only that draw where
there was just everything basically
i just i i just remember the the first

[10:32]
i just i i just remember the the first
time uh with my with my now now wife
when i met their family or like we went
on on vacation together for the first
time at some point and they obviously
needed to play a poker tournament with
me
so we made like the most hyper sit and
go i could create in a way

[10:47]
go i could create in a way
um
and yeah like her mom was was the end
boss i tried to play like a somewhat
reasonable strategy um
like
short but you know she got me heads up
it's like the the 30 big blinds um race

[11:01]
it's like the the 30 big blinds um race
call with king 5 off you just don't see
it coming and then it's like the
i i just blew up with pocket force i
still remember this one so the trophy
still belongs to her and we didn't play
ever since
do you sometimes notice from yourself

[11:16]
do you sometimes notice from yourself
when you just play a regular game with
friends that you maybe you know
sometimes tell yourself come on
stephanie you don't have to be that
competitive now in this game at in this
environment you have to hold yourself
back sometimes that's i i think like uh
i have others telling me that that it's

[11:32]
i have others telling me that that it's
like we can just play for fun we're like
yes that's true it's like and i don't
mind losing at all actually um it's like
really that but the game for me is is
the joys in figuring out what's the best

[11:45]
the joys in figuring out what's the best
move and not just like sitting there and
rolling the dice and see what happens
next so it's like if you ask me to to
like play bad you're killing the fun for
me it's like
i mean i don't know it's not like i'm
like the super try hard when like or i'm
i'm not counting the cards or numbers or

[12:01]
i'm not counting the cards or numbers or
whatever is part of the game uh when
it's just like a casual thing there uh
definitely not but still when i look at
what's my next move i try to make a move
that makes sense in a way
yeah like our brain is just analytical
right when we look at the game that

[12:15]
right when we look at the game that
we're playing whichever game we're
immediately trying to figure out how the
game works what the best strategy is
yeah sometimes i do have conflict though
when it's like
this is probably the best thing to do
but it would hurt my wife's game
significantly and then i have to choose
between you know getting the fire out

[12:32]
between you know getting the fire out
there or winning
i started like kind of a have a routine
now for for a couple of years now um
giving us as christmas presents to the
family uh cooperative games
it's like that we can play together and

[12:45]
it's like that we can play together and
we win together or lose together that's
like a different thing it's like those
zero-sum games where one wins
and one loses just like
me kind of trying to succeed always
hurts others at the same time while in
those type of games it actually

[13:01]
those type of games it actually
gives them maybe maybe more fun if we as
a team win the whole show then so it's
uh it's like yeah this is the maybe a
little recommendation for everyone
suffering from those problems
yeah if i have to choose to play a co-op
game

[13:15]
game
and my wife is involved i usually go for
the co-op game because she's very
competitive i'm very competitive
does it really end well you tried to uh
we tried pandemic the other time you you
played it
like uh it's quite you know given

[13:30]
like uh it's quite you know given
there's a little pandemic going around
it's basically you as a team everyone
gets a certain role and you have to
together make sure that
various diseases don't spread to the
world so maybe a good suggestion for
next christmas pandemic it's a good good
co-op game as well

[13:47]
you also mentioned that uh what
attracted you i mean you already
mentioned that like strategic games that
that's kind of what attracts you right
the strategic side uh with poker it was
also the combination that you could play
it
for money what do you think

[14:01]
for money what do you think
adding money to the table adds to a game
it's like keeping track it's like in the
end it's just like the next level of
putting down the results in a list with
my buddies and it's like if i just play

[14:15]
my buddies and it's like if i just play
and we forget it it's like okay it's
over but right this is what i mean it
means something that i still remember uh
like that that i'm ahead 20 games in the
in the settlers of katan match right
it's like and we played that when we
were like i was 12 and he 14 was like

[14:32]
were like i was 12 and he 14 was like
our peak time of that i would say so
it's like some something like that and
and this is just yeah just just tracking
tracking in the end so it's really like
you have the the proof or or longer
feeling for that yes you are you're good

[14:46]
feeling for that yes you are you're good
at that um is is pretty nice like it was
never like the money itself i think i
didn't like the start of my career i
never cashed out anything i never i mean
we are talking really about like uh
pocket money here until the the full
tilt crash i think i i'll yeah

[15:01]
tilt crash i think i i'll yeah
i think the first thing was like i
needed a new um desktop so i i cashed
out something because this has to be an
investment from my poker role i didn't
have any i mean i was i was a student i
didn't have any real money it was like

[15:15]
didn't have any real money it was like
three digit uh somewhere maybe um and
and
yeah so that was really it's more of a
high score um than anything else
okay so just a way a way to keep score
so you were not like me i remember the
first couple of times when i won money

[15:30]
first couple of times when i won money
it immediately got cashed out and spend
it no way no no i'm not a spender
very conservative guy okay this probably
has also helped you
uh along your career at which point you
said you know you you would cash out
some money buy a computer cash out

[15:45]
some money buy a computer cash out
someone just for
necessary things at which point were you
like hey
i can actually buy quite a lot of new
computers with all the money that i'm
winning
maybe i could consider doing this
full-time
it's a it's a

[16:00]
it's a it's a
great feeling that you could buy that
stuff right um but it's it's yeah it's
like what what does it give to you so
it's like okay if it is an investment in
like your future career or anything it's
like i always love the freedom that

[16:15]
like i always love the freedom that
comes with it like i don't have to look
in the bank account when i think about
my next vacation like okay can we do
this or that like i still have that
feeling just because i was always
like i always had the friends in a
non-poker environment around me i know
there are lots of people who kind of

[16:30]
there are lots of people who kind of
lost track of like what normal things
costs in a way when they are traveling
like vegas and everything and like for
me it's i don't know i think it's
expensive to spend like a hundred
dollars on an average bad meal for for a
dinner like it's like okay you get the
same thing plus the dessert for for 15

[16:48]
same thing plus the dessert for for 15
euros in in like where i'm from so it's
like
that just so like something like that
people lose lose track of that and uh i
think i was always doing a good job like
still
being okay with that and then um the

[17:00]
being okay with that and then um the
first main decision point i had was i
was just playing on the side when doing
uni and i was like really having that
that thought okay instead of playing the
video games that just kill my time and
are some somewhat fun i just play poker

[17:16]
are some somewhat fun i just play poker
instead which gives me maybe an
opportunity for the future that was
never that it's like super super clear
um
and uh and
is fun for me as well if it's not just
like the biggest downswing of all times

[17:30]
like the biggest downswing of all times
so um
yeah that was then the first time where
i finished finished my bachelor's degree
where the question was do i
go for the master um
keep studying like that do it like i
don't know 50 50 70 30 whatever it is or
do i try this poker thing and then i

[17:47]
do i try this poker thing and then i
remember just like uh i don't know
whether every one of us had that but
like one talk with like yeah with uh it
was with my uncle actually uh who just
asked that question which i asked
i keep asking for lots of things in life

[18:00]
i keep asking for lots of things in life
it's like
which
option would you regret if you don't do
it it's like that okay you could do your
master's degree in somewhat engineering
you will end up with like a nice job
career
you see yourself in 10 years i will
definitely regret not trying that poker

[18:15]
definitely regret not trying that poker
thing right being stuck in a job that is
probably good uh well paid i'm having
good life i think that that was like the
path i was going um or the other way
around we're like okay do you try the
poker thing really would you ever regret
trying that

[18:30]
trying that
like looking back and then no like the
way back was so easy like okay then i
maybe
lost a year where like i think loss is a
totally wrong word um and then i go back
to what i did before um and this was
like

[18:45]
like after thinking about
it in that way it was like the clearest
decision of all times and then it were
at the same time that was um 2014 like
all the circumstances coming together
that i met
fedor reiner bannon and canada and then
they wanted to go to to brighton to have

[19:02]
they wanted to go to to brighton to have
a flat there so i was like just
just going there um
here my just desktop turned out that was
weird i had a black screen for a second
so um yeah
and that was just like it was made very

[19:16]
and that was just like it was made very
very easy for me to just say like let's
go i join you and um
that's where everything like the real
poker career then started
you mentioned like
if you if let's say for example you
tried it you said it's not really lost

[19:31]
tried it you said it's not really lost
that year that you would try it's not
really lost what do you mean with that
i mean you try something out you learn
things it's like other people go abroad
for a year and have like so many new
impressions i guess even when like
you don't or i wouldn't succeed in poker

[19:46]
you don't or i wouldn't succeed in poker
at that time you still learn a lot about
life if i make the decision
moving to england to try something out
to be your own boss i mean how in that
world can you not end up like smarter
than before or learning life lessons in

[20:00]
than before or learning life lessons in
a way
yeah so it's like the you either win or
you learn mentality exactly it's like
it's not that success in the life sense
doesn't necessarily uh correlate 100
with with poker success uh financially
in that in that moment

[20:17]
in that in that moment
right that
that actually makes a lot of sense so
basically you started out playing poker
mainly for the strategic aspect you just
really liked the game when you turned
sort of pro did you have
any sort of aspirations or was it just

[20:30]
any sort of aspirations or was it just
like you take it one stake at a time or
were you like no i'm gonna make a
million dollar playing poker or yeah
like you're you're driving for it what
were your your goals starting out
that's like being good or like what i
mean what actually is the same with like
all other things before like sports i

[20:45]
all other things before like sports i
never tried to i don't know accelerate
there anywhere and and play like higher
i wasn't like really good at something
so i always kept at a level i stayed at
a level where
i was like i was like mainly winning so
this was the same in my poker career i

[21:00]
this was the same in my poker career i
was that guy like before moving up to
nl500 i wanted to make sure to have like
the most crushing graph on ll 200 for i
don't know let's make it better 200 000
hands than 100 000 hands that was that
was pretty much more my approach um and

[21:15]
was pretty much more my approach um and
i was enjoying that and like that that i
mean obviously that steady income and
like doing maybe some calculations in my
head what that might lead to that was
sealed at the time of supernova elite
back then where like oh if i make it up
to those stakes i can i can target that

[21:31]
to those stakes i can i can target that
and that would be like that would be
incredible obviously um and was like
really step by step like that really
moving up the levels um where
maybe the next part of the story is
really where

[21:45]
really where
that ends where actually there was like
a certain level where i could play
pretty much
everything if i think it's it's worth it
um
but then
it was easy to lose the fire again like
obviously you can move up to like and

[22:00]
obviously you can move up to like and
then have the bankroll for i don't know
nl 20k and and stuff like that but this
is just well this is a process over time
making all the money it's like not that
well back then if you place zoom 500 as
a regular or zoom 1k
you can select any tables there are if

[22:16]
you can select any tables there are if
there is a good table running so there
was like no new level you can achieve
anymore and that was the first time
where i was like yeah pretty much i'm
just sitting around waiting for action
and really doing in a way a normal job
because there is not that that fire like
pushing you up anymore um

[22:32]
pushing you up anymore um
and yeah
how was i was poker different
after that happened compared to before
that happened so you were really chasing
up the level always looking up what's
the next step what's the next step and
then at some point
you know

[22:46]
you know
yeah it was really you were like okay
that's not really a next step
yeah did that really demotivate you not
in what i did definitely so um i mean i
was doing supernova elite for two years
there
and um
the like the driving main driving force

[23:00]
the like the driving main driving force
was really reaching those goals like
collecting those vpp right uh like
like i remember
the first year i managed to finish it
like december 22nd and the other one i
was done by december 15th and could take
like whole christmas off that felt great

[23:17]
like whole christmas off that felt great
um and then there was actually that year
where um they [ __ ] up the the snes um
and and took all that away on stars like
the vip program so it was like okay that
was everything i did and

[23:32]
was everything i did and
what now i think that was 2016 and this
is actually where another coincidence
that just like that was the time
theodore already won everything and he
just like was kept talking to us like
you guys you need to start all those

[23:45]
you guys you need to start all those
high rollers you need to play that
everyone is super [ __ ] there let's just
crush that show now like okay let's
let's try that out pretty much uh i was
not never really into live poker um but
it was yeah in a way a coincidence that
like okay supernova elite is not there i

[24:02]
like okay supernova elite is not there i
i mean big scripting was a was a was the
thing back then everyone like running a
script having like multiple sites open i
never did that i actually i was i was
too cheap to buy a proper computer so my
my computer was not ready to run

[24:16]
my computer was not ready to run
something like that and i just like and
the worse when it comes to both hardware
software i'm like
my grandma probably could could uh could
help me here with with uh what
what i need needs to be done on the
computer right just like if i tuned in

[24:30]
computer right just like if i tuned in
here and my sound was not working i have
no clue what to do like really that that
that kind of shitty with it uh so that
was never my thing so i always stuck to
playing way more
i played afternoon pool zoom 500 where
everyone knew he is not really winning

[24:45]
everyone knew he is not really winning
like it's it's like but and we could
play like search for a good table in
nl1k 2k but apparently it's like really
really bad players getting the best
seats um and i would never get into it i
could battle for open seating but then
at the same time it's like i like taking

[25:01]
at the same time it's like i like taking
breaks so if i want to make a break
every 90 minutes i lose all regular
tables which is like yeah then it's not
really worth fighting for it so that was
it that like yeah that cash game career
back then was i don't know didn't work

[25:15]
back then was i don't know didn't work
out or i was like not really looking
interesting ahead or i needed to change
uh how i did things and then yeah that
that all those live things came in
between
and uh yeah i kept i started traveling
with the with the guys uh that i guess

[25:30]
with the with the guys uh that i guess
most of you know out there
so actually you chose uh more you
preferred the comfort of the of the zoom
grind uh because obviously i was active
uh very active back at that time as well
and i never really played zoom i was
maybe playing the higher stakes and then

[25:46]
maybe playing the higher stakes and then
the scripting and it was indeed
what you said like a lot of bad players
got the tables which i actually always
thought was great right usually the the
worst players are technically they still
try to find a way to make
money right so they specialize in other

[26:00]
money right so they specialize in other
areas like for example okay i get i get
the fastest i i put a server next to the
server of pokerstars and iso of men play
from there and it scripts me in every
game which i was like okay wow the the
worst players have the best scripts yes

[26:15]
so
but it's it's really that i love the
video you made about that kind of fifa
cards system like rating system yeah
where you need to understand that
everyone is different and takes like
it's like not that everyone is trying to
maximize the same thing it's really like

[26:32]
maximize the same thing it's really like
yes it's about the money but in that
moment i was definitely not trying to
maximize the money outcome i love
playing so it's like i'm not sitting
around for two hours to then get a good
table on 5k would definitely make me
more money back then but i would hate

[26:46]
more money back then but i would hate
life like sitting there maybe even i
mean who are those guys who's that that
guy from from israel who has like even
like his alarm clock set to to
everything was just like really the
biggest a cool cool 1992

[27:00]
biggest a cool cool 1992
oh
yeah yeah you had all the tricks and the
shopping further away than 200 meters
from his flat because like 24 7
everything is running there and he gets
like a phone call pretty much if someone
joins like one of the whale tables and
it's like and i'm like this i mean this

[27:16]
it's like and i'm like this i mean this
is
the worst thing for me i want to sit
down i want to play because i yeah and
if i see a nice graph whatever stakes in
the end
that gives me something that gives me
more than than yeah making infinite
money it's like yeah we'll probably come

[27:31]
money it's like yeah we'll probably come
back to that to the to that point as
well we're like it's yeah not at that
point but later it's it's a question
about what do you want to get from life
what what do you enjoy uh do you try to
like i mean there are people with like

[27:45]
like i mean there are people with like
infinite money in the bank probably
still like trying to make more out of it
where like once you know how you think
your life you want it to look like like
then that is just unnecessary pretty
much right we're like i'm the
yeah i will have at some point a nice

[28:01]
yeah i will have at some point a nice
house in a in a little village somewhere
and enjoy life there uh and do stuff
that i like where like yeah i don't need
the uh
infinite money for that so it's really a
different driving forces for everyone

[28:15]
different driving forces for everyone
where it's it's fun to think about it in
the poker sense because uh just figuring
that out about someone helps you so much
to understand all the decisions we're
like yes if you're just maximizing money
i took the totally wrong career path

[28:30]
i took the totally wrong career path
yeah i can i i can i can relate to that
a little bit as well but i think the
main takeaway from this is that it's
very important to understand
what is your motivation in poker right
because there were also i'm sure a lot
of players
that were
maybe choosing like the same approach as

[28:46]
maybe choosing like the same approach as
you but were not as conscious about it
and then afterwards felt very bad i wish
i would have made more money in poker uh
you understand then it's not a conscious
decision and then you end up
doing things and feel a little bit
unsatisfied at the end which you know at
the end is obviously not really the goal

[29:01]
the end is obviously not really the goal
absolutely i have so many names in in
mind from like back back in the day soon
500 where like most of them are playing
high stakes now or were playing and now
just like seeing after a year i had that
just like financial regrets in a way

[29:15]
just like financial regrets in a way
where yes i was i was probably putting
in
five times the hours or three times or
double i don't know um to get out like
whatever sne makes pretty much um with
some added winnings and then i look up
the graphs from invoker and iceman i

[29:31]
the graphs from invoker and iceman i
guess you know those two names they i
spent yesterday they stopped playing 500
and we were like one level like crushing
those zoom pools and they just started
scripting playing all the five good 5k
tables and then i looked it up like okay

[29:45]
tables and then i looked it up like okay
he made a million there he made a
million there and i'm like yes i got my
200k rake back plus a little winnings
probably playing like two times the
hours at least um definitely like more
than five times the hands were like yes
um there was like one point where i

[30:01]
um there was like one point where i
could regret things but if i'm honest
with myself i didn't so it's like uh
yeah
definitely like i did that that that
that is very good uh
then you made the right decisions at
that moment yeah it's just like i'm sure
uh

[30:15]
uh
it shouldn't be about like i mean
definitely this this shouldn't be like
whining about like you could make like
smarter decisions if you
take like different like i mean for
different people that is just like
smarter to do the one thing but it's
really that that consciousness about
what you enjoy what you want to get out

[30:31]
what you enjoy what you want to get out
of it what you are playing doing it for
um i think this is very very important
so like just just knowing that about
yourself
i'm a big advocate just as used to ask a
lot of questions right there's no it

[30:45]
lot of questions right there's no it
really depends on what your definition
of success is and you try to reach that
that's that definition of success for
yourself yeah but often people don't
really think about it and then they just
copy what other people are doing and
they copy what the general poker
population is saying right and then you

[31:01]
population is saying right and then you
end up
just going somewhere without really
knowing what you want out of it
um
i'm sure adam has been silently waiting
on the sidelines well also has a lot of
questions i mean there was a lot of
goodness in here any any questions for

[31:15]
goodness in here any any questions for
stefan so far adam
yeah many questions first of all i'd
like to bring it back to the start when
you start your poke career so i've got
the image of you being very competitive
with your older brother in particular
you graduate from uni and then you
decide that you're going to take a

[31:31]
decide that you're going to take a
chance on poca and give it a go full
time was there any skills you developed
in the past or any life experiences that
you developed that allowed you to have
confidence that it was going to work out
anything you developed at that point
i mean i think i developed it throughout

[31:46]
i mean i think i developed it throughout
my poker career like while playing next
to uni i mean you can see it actually my
uni grades um i mean i was always like
one of those guys where everything is
easy in school like uh um
get that well and then i started pretty
pretty good off in uni as long as i kept

[32:01]
pretty good off in uni as long as i kept
working for it and then it was like that
switch okay poker got more interesting
and then i only like learn as much to
exactly pass the exams which was like
not going there and learning for one
week was pretty much the line for most
of the of the majors and um

[32:16]
of the of the majors and um
and yeah so that was i was then making
that decision it was like if we if we
are honest it was more like 95 it's it's
working and i know that i can make um
amount x um
and uh yeah i'd like i don't know maybe

[32:31]
and uh yeah i'd like i don't know maybe
something i developed before is really
that
trying to to always understand the
bigger picture where like okay i'm like
there's lots of unclarity in the world
of poker how it will develop break back
systems where is it allowed where not um

[32:46]
systems where is it allowed where not um
et cetera how what
how do you can you do something with the
money in the end or is it like some kind
of
semi-illegal money that is lying around
so stuff like that um and i remember
that still back from school where i
guess

[33:01]
guess
i like my motivation was not to make the
the best abi tour it was more like um
making the somewhat okay reasonable best
of it to a possible with really least
amount of effort so like i'm the guy
who's just like that like before those

[33:15]
who's just like that like before those
last two years of school we get handed
out like one thing where everything is
explained how it counts exactly into
your well degree that that everyone sees
in the end where no one had a clue they
were just like doing that and i'm like
okay

[33:30]
okay
it's like i i know i need to choose
either music or uh art
but out of the four semesters only two
of those count so obviously i found a
smart way because i'm super [ __ ] at both
of that um to like find a way around
that i have like a i don't know we have

[33:46]
that i have like a i don't know we have
a
point system up to 50 and 15 is best so
i finished like i took arts and one time
i just did like a presentation in
something in in one of the of the
semesters where we actually didn't have
an
uh didn't have like big art to do

[34:01]
uh didn't have like big art to do
ourselves we had like one exam that is
fine we learned something i can do that
and i do a presentation to get that
extra degree so i ended up with 13
points there and another one with 13
points and the others were like six and
five like just but like having that

[34:15]
five like just but like having that
consciousness where to put the effort in
to really succeed in that way it was the
the option to have like an optional
extra subject which was um
informatics where like yes that was just
super chilled and easy just a fun round
with with like eight geeky guys and

[34:32]
with with like eight geeky guys and
everyone's just like smashing it and
like by using that i could just like all
the other [ __ ] subjects
in my eyes
didn't have to count like
zero courses of religion where like i
told like the first first lesson that

[34:47]
told like the first first lesson that
teacher i hated him i told him like i
don't give a [ __ ] because i know it
doesn't like that kind of stuff where
this is um
yeah relating to poker as well just like
finding i mean being a little after the
best rake back then like finding some

[35:00]
best rake back then like finding some
ways and then cons like consistency with
like uh pushing things through um yeah
that's that's maybe something you can
take as that
yeah i like that it sounds like you've
always been able to see the bigger
picture and then navigate your way to

[35:15]
picture and then navigate your way to
that end point in a kind of concise way
rather than just doing actions home to
get to somewhere you've already thought
it through in spend some time so for
yourself when you first got into poker
what were some of the initial early
goals you set yourself do you have any
initial little milestones that you

[35:30]
initial little milestones that you
wanted to reach in your career
um i mean first i just started trying
out in the very beginning right someone
told me hey you can get those
53 bucks there and then let's go from
there and i was like oh there are
strategy articles about that and then i
first tried like a short stack strategy

[35:46]
first tried like a short stack strategy
that you played with 20 bigs then emits
and i tried like what is working what
makes sense until then like really um
getting into it and enjoying the theory
behind it watching the videos of like i
mean super [ __ ] plays back then
obviously but it was like still yeah

[36:00]
obviously but it was like still yeah
that was great and that that got me
hooked in a way um
and then
it was really just like that
level by level so i remember probably
like the the worst moment in my career
where i really like

[36:15]
where i really like
when i got up to nl50 at one point
um it was like i don't know 20 25 stack
bankroll management so i had a thousand
dollar on my account i played nl50 and i
lost like
i don't know just like enough that i
couldn't play an l50 anymore just like i

[36:31]
couldn't play an l50 anymore just like i
mean just losing five stacks in a
session or something and then like okay
i had that moment which i usually
do not have too much uh like that that
classic tilt moment move up and l 200
heads up it is uh just to to win it back

[36:46]
heads up it is uh just to to win it back
um and uh yeah luckily that went well
but this is pretty much the only thing i
guess other people have way more of that
or like how often did you go broke or
etc i i could stick to plan if if i
learn from a site that seems reasonable

[37:01]
learn from a site that seems reasonable
that 25 stack bankroll management is the
thing i look at my bankroll and if it's
not if it's not two hundred fifty
dollars well then i play nl 25 or just
add like once one table of nl50 and like
sticking to those like again setting

[37:16]
sticking to those like again setting
frameworks a little like a wardrobe
right setting frameworks and then
sticking to those instead of like
creating a new
crazy crazy box because i think it's the
best thing i can do now like really
taking emotions um
out of the gameplay even though i hate i

[37:31]
out of the gameplay even though i hate i
i i love i love uh i love whining and
flaming and is like other people might
think i'm the biggest tilt box in the
way in the world but i think i i i have
a good way of letting it out somewhere
else and and not put it into into what i

[37:45]
else and and not put it into into what i
click on the tables actually
besides some ace five suited gems but
that's it
yeah gto gto
so yeah when i've been doing a bit of
research on you and listening to your
podcast i've always found that there
hasn't been many noticeable obstacles it

[38:02]
hasn't been many noticeable obstacles it
almost feels like you've had this kind
of progression where you've almost just
like every opportunity's just been a
learning progression next level and very
calculated and very almost like linear
so for you like looking back on your
career with any kind of big obstacles

[38:15]
career with any kind of big obstacles
that you faced any moments where you
were down either yourself or the path
you were on it feels like you've always
had this good self-awareness to navigate
your space it was any moments where you
hit a roadblock i hit a wall where that
wasn't true for you
um
actually not really in the in the cash

[38:31]
actually not really in the in the cash
game sense because they are obviously at
times you feel like okay you need some
new input to progress maybe it's just a
downswing where i really have that image
in mind of like that
awesome looking
nice overall graph where obviously if

[38:45]
nice overall graph where obviously if
you zoom in for like and choose a
certain 20 000 hands you might feel like
the worst player of all times just like
those those typical upswings and down
swings and this is what i tried to do
myself to really have that all right
let's freaking zoom out and then
everything looks nice again so this is

[39:02]
everything looks nice again so this is
this is obviously something um i never
played like those too many normal tables
or heads up
i never had those
like people are talking about nemesis or
i can't play this guy or he's [ __ ] me

[39:15]
i can't play this guy or he's [ __ ] me
up i obviously have that feeling in the
zoom pool as well but this is i guess
something that people
get annoyed by so just by playing so
much zoom um i didn't have that
and then actually the cash career
always went kind of smooth um just

[39:30]
always went kind of smooth um just
because i'm
so so nitty in a way with make not with
like the the the money investment but
with the uh making sure that i beat that
table so i was like even if i think that
table is okay um and i don't know why
they are battling now and i think i'm

[39:45]
they are battling now and i think i'm
better than like four of the five
players on the table um sometimes that
was the case i was like no that's not
worth it so i was like really
um
zoom was another thing but then choosing
tables is like yeah i want to be 100
sure pretty much um

[40:01]
sure pretty much um
so i think this was a big reason then
and that definitely looked different in
tournament life because they are just
it's not under your control so there
were definitely moments where
you ask yourself this does everything
make sense right it's just like uh those

[40:16]
make sense right it's just like uh those
others
theodore um keeps winning everything
yeah and then like you think like okay
just like in theory in theory you
probably play better lots of spots yes
there is a live element but then in the
end um

[40:30]
end um
i mean in the first year i could make a
nice compilation out of freaking insane
suckouts just like just whining about
pre-flop ball lanes where yes it was
probably playing how many hands do you
play live maybe 10 000 hands and you are
like 10 stacks under ev in those 10 000

[40:47]
like 10 stacks under ev in those 10 000
ants that looks [ __ ] right we're like
there's nothing you can do about that um
and uh that was something that is
that was tough and i remember maybe one
time where um we had a wii right i
obviously had shares and others as well

[41:01]
obviously had shares and others as well
so the year i wasn't playing too much uh
where i was just like trying to get a
little into live poker was 2016
after my two times sne and there um that
was the the year where reiner and fedor
chopped the super high roller ball the

[41:15]
chopped the super high roller ball the
300k in vegas
i had what did i have like
one percent each or something like that
so it was like a 100k payday that was
and i had
no other investment in that tournament
it was just like yeah staying with them
and that was like the sweat i had so

[41:30]
and that was like the sweat i had so
that was like a pretty decent tournament
and uh that was like and then we played
like some of the arya 25 case
uh where i don't know what did we have
like i don't know 40 action on my own
and like some
10 swaps with like

[41:46]
10 swaps with like
not only the germans but like there was
like the typical type of investment
where it's like oh i'm out oh stevie won
it in the end so i'm even again it was
like really just running like pretty
much not a single losing day in those
tournaments where like that was smooth
and um made not only me but others ready

[42:02]
and um made not only me but others ready
to just like take bigger pieces and then
there was like one big trip we did
that was to um vegas in november 2016 um
as like part of the coaching team for
kenny hollard for the wsop final table

[42:16]
kenny hollard for the wsop final table
um and then there were high rollers from
there we flew to manila to play a triton
stop
and from there to macau to play i don't
know whether it was stars or another
triton stop i don't know where i think

[42:30]
triton stop i don't know where i think
it was a
consecutive like
45 bullets or so not caching if i just
look at like the pieces i have and my
pieces that are obviously bigger where
like i think i lost like a third of my

[42:45]
like i think i lost like a third of my
role could have been more if i invested
even more or like others got hurt a
little more um where
this is like
i never had that before in cash right
it's not possible in cash it's and it's
like i think what

[43:00]
like i think what
was a big difference there because it
really
like was tough for me mentally at that
point just like losing that amount of
money that i kind of
won through hard working before like my
my sne money where i think it was a very

[43:15]
my sne money where i think it was a very
very different feeling for people like
fedor or reiner where like yes they they
had those their moments where they
probably
doubled their bankroll or or even more
than that right uh fedor winning
what was it w coupe um main event just

[43:31]
what was it w coupe um main event just
like going from i don't know 100k roll
to a million or something like that i
think that that helps you to not realize
that money in that way and then losing
200k doesn't hurt you or like thinking
another tournament i think like reiner's
career start was getting second in the

[43:45]
career start was getting second in the
sunday million in a way where like it's
different feeling than just like
calculating your hourly and then putting
the hours in pretty much uh so that was
the thing where like yes that was
probably the the toughest time where
then um
i i grinded parts of it back in december

[44:02]
i i grinded parts of it back in december
online so i had a good run there talking
about the city goes shout out to the 5k
turbo sip and goes on poker stars and i
don't ate super poker i guess was uh was
our vip so shout out to him here and the
good old times there um

[44:16]
good old times there um
and uh yeah that was probably the
toughest one and then obviously
some more after then
running super well for a while then
again i think
what was like 2018 where i felt like i
was

[44:31]
was
like pretty ahead of the the tournament
game i i don't know like had the
confidence because we did lots of those
drafts and i was like always top three
four picks even from like the american
side picking me very very early uh so
that gives you good confidence and then

[44:45]
that gives you good confidence and then
just like
yeah watching uh justin bonimo win
everything by just like uh i mean not
being 100 convinced by lots of lots of
plays he did there and just like yeah
it's one flip you're out one flip you
are out and like
when you're playing the biggest one so

[45:00]
when you're playing the biggest one so
like just um having that feeling of that
i don't know one summer where you play
the 300k and are
the first person out um
where it was like that weird format with
three bullets just like i don't know one
hour three times standard all-ins three

[45:15]
hour three times standard all-ins three
times losing 40 plus equity okay you are
out uh and then the next time uh and
then like playing the the million one
drop um flipping out there and in like a
nice spot um it's just that right it's
like a classic tournament whining in the

[45:30]
like a classic tournament whining in the
end it's like playing two sundays right
over the whole year um that's just what
live poker is so um yeah definitely but
it's like when you're not when you
didn't grow up in the tournament world
it's different uh to work with it i i

[45:45]
it's different uh to work with it i i
guess and so there it was really really
important to have uh that group of
people around me just like just do like
that wouldn't work out for me just
sitting here on my computer i never
played mtt's just like alone i loved
those little challenges let's let's be
like uh five people 10 people let's rent

[46:02]
like uh five people 10 people let's rent
a nice house and play a series where
like you you see yourself as a team even
though everyone is fighting for himself
just like locking myself here in that
room to uh to really um grind
tournaments i i couldn't do it at all i

[46:15]
tournaments i i couldn't do it at all i
would like there i would really be the
biggest tilt box just like the the um
skill or like the level of play you put
in is just so not correlated to the
outcome you get this is something i can
i can not work very well with

[46:31]
i can not work very well with
yeah so it sounds like throughout your
career you've made a lot of kind of
pre-thought out almost like safety first
loris decisions that have allowed you to
navigate the poker world without less
less scores and obstacles than most
players obviously like you said at the

[46:46]
players obviously like you said at the
end when you are a lot of action in
those super high rollers you experience
the big down swing if they're your role
but it seems like that was like an
anomaly event and i think a lot of
players can learn lessons from your
ability to think long term you know you
see the bigger picture it sounds like

[47:00]
see the bigger picture it sounds like
perhaps at times you could have been
playing higher stakes with your role and
you chose to grind out higher win rates
at the stakes you were playing but going
back to like your kind of personality
type and how you uh kind of set your
goals and targets for poca it sounds
like that's a good fit for you it's a

[47:15]
like that's a good fit for you it's a
kind of lower kind of ev option
sometimes but it's safety first and it's
going to lead to a more solid outcome or
more secure outcome so yeah very
interested in that part i just want to
segue a little bit into um your
background in sports because i've got a
sports science degree myself i want to

[47:30]
sports science degree myself i want to
add to that because i think it's it's
it's really important that it comes back
again to what you want to get from life
right i i have to say like there's if
you take from like the german crew if
you pick one or like ask everyone who is
the person with the least chance of

[47:47]
the person with the least chance of
going broke it's like 10 out of 10
people will pick me right this is just
how i am but at the same time it's like
who is the the last person who has a
shot at like making i don't know 10
million plus it will be me as well right

[48:01]
million plus it will be me as well right
it's just like that what do you want to
get from life is your goal like a little
house and a nice family and and
living is if is that a great life for
you well then my approach is probably
better if you want to want to eat out in

[48:15]
better if you want to want to eat out in
like three star restaurants every day
and fly from like dubai to vegas to
melbourne and like tell take take a
private jet if possible yeah then
different right so if like we especially
watch the the super hyrule scene it's
like all those people who really made

[48:30]
like all those people who really made
the money there they had the risk to
pretty much lose a lot as well or i mean
we don't know see those people too much
we're like startup fedor is like
winning the super high or like winning
the superhero ball having shares in
rhino as well having that and then
obviously firing harder the whole summer

[48:47]
obviously firing harder the whole summer
to just ending it up with winning the
100k where like i don't know how big his
piece was but ridiculously big compared
to what i would take personally with
probably the same bankroll at that point
of time so it's really that it's just

[49:00]
of time so it's really that it's just
like an equation what is like
you can you can set your goals do you
want to gamble for for like having
infinite money
whatever infinite means to you or like
want to have a high chance to achieve
what you want to achieve or you just

[49:15]
what you want to achieve or you just
need to know that where same thing we
see in the crypto market right now right
if someone is telling me um
yeah like at one at one like this is the
the
high roller tournament talk at the table
yeah i was like i was up to like 20
million in crypto and now i have like

[49:31]
million in crypto and now i have like
two million left and i'm like what the
[ __ ] like what is wrong with you like
did you really need to gamble that up i
mean if you go from 20 to two
it just means that you try to have the
chance to make a hundred where like this
20 and 100 is for the life i wish to

[49:46]
20 and 100 is for the life i wish to
lead is not not a difference at all
right so it's like you like in my
value system he was risking everything
to win nothing in a way where like uh
yes um but this is now where you need to

[50:00]
yes um but this is now where you need to
know more about your your value system
so that was just it fits all together
and in my picture at least so um okay
okay can i add on that like
there's also in my opinion and some
people indeed see this different like
let's say for example
you have 100k okay

[50:17]
you have 100k okay
and you know you're still young you
might gamble it up you know because
going from 100k to 1 million that's
definitely yeah it changes your life
quite significantly right but let's say
someone already has two three million

[50:30]
someone already has two three million
are you really gonna put that on the
line
to make 20 million
it's like
you know to get back to that to three
million it's quite it's quite hard to
get back to 100k from zero it's a little
bit easier but you know you have way
more to lose right

[50:46]
more to lose right
it's it's the thing i mean it's just
like uh i mean i i wrote i mean everyone
who is more interested into that like
check out like something like prospect
theory just making choices between
things um
and that is i mean it's just so
important to know what you want to get

[51:00]
important to know what you want to get
like other people look at me and think
okay what the [ __ ] is that a boring life
you want to lead i mean i need this and
that like let's talk to bryn kenney
right it's like he doesn't care whether
he's like a negative 3 million he still
tries to gamble it up to 20 plus because
this is what he probably needs for the

[51:16]
this is what he probably needs for the
lifestyle he imagines he wants to lead
so uh so it's like everyone is different
i think that's that's totally totally
fine in a way as well
yeah there is no right or wrong there is
only what works for you and what is in
line with your goals
yeah

[51:30]
yeah
so i'm intrigued what is your value
system and how did you uh start to
unravel and sort of find out the things
you do value i think for a lot of us
we're kind of dragged multiple
directions we're often influenced by our
parents society our friends around us
and we think we want success the money

[51:46]
and we think we want success the money
the the big achievements it's very hard
to actually know what makes us happy it
sounds like from quite an early age or
at least in your poor career you had a
clear value system and you could
actually weigh up the pros and cons and
who you wanted to be so yeah just
curious what is your current kind of
value system and how do you navigate the

[52:01]
value system and how do you navigate the
temptations around that yeah it's
definitely something i learned
throughout the poker career so before i
mean i had a great childhood in a little
village in the black forest so it's like
yeah you couldn't imagine anything
better at least for me and um
and then i've i've i've seen the wide

[52:17]
and then i've i've i've seen the wide
world pretty much or at least it feels
like i had the potential to do anything
i wanted uh throughout my poker career
just like by traveling so much and um i
had like that one moment of realization
especially where um i could never stay

[52:31]
especially where um i could never stay
like seven weeks straight in vegas so
this summer i always split it up in in
two trips and um
and flew flew back home for like a two
or two week vacation line like june in
europe which is the best time anyways uh

[52:45]
europe which is the best time anyways uh
and i mean we all know it like what i i
don't know whether whether uh whether
rene knows for a certain years but like
watching the world cup you know it's
like cooler when you do it not at 9am so
it's it's like stuff like that and there
um i found out i had a talk with a

[53:02]
um i found out i had a talk with a
friend of mine there just like and and
uh she was asking me
um like where my next wild trips where
my next vic she was asking for a next
vacation where my next wild vacation
goes to and i'm like uh
not at like this year right this year is

[53:17]
not at like this year right this year is
my vacation sitting here and like in my
home base where i feel home just like uh
making a bike tour with you here and
and eating ice cream that's like the
perfect vacation coming down and like
she expected more like yes then i fly to

[53:30]
she expected more like yes then i fly to
australia and do want to go on a crazy
trip there there was the first moment
where i really realized hey this is what
i if i can't choose what i do right now
it was that thing and i chose that and
the other thing was um
being actually it was new year's eve i

[53:45]
being actually it was new year's eve i
guess or just the time between christmas
and new year's eve
where
i had such a bad feeling
about
having to go to the bahamas soon it was
a it's a very very bad flights to there
just because of like how the time zones

[54:00]
just because of like how the time zones
and like the the when when the planes
are allowed to start to just do it all
in in one trip um
and i had to get up i don't know 4 30 in
the morning
january 3rd to fly to the bahamas and i
was talking about it like really as if
it was a must and a bad thing where i

[54:17]
it was a must and a bad thing where i
think in a way it's not okay to talk
like that about flying to the bahamas in
january it's just like if it feels like
that something is going wrong and this
is pretty much where i made the the
decision that this is not my it's cool

[54:30]
decision that this is not my it's cool
and great and i don't want to miss
anything of of what i have there but
it's not where i see myself where uh i
don't know i have others in mind let's
say uh
yeah i had a great talk with nick
petrangelo um like uh we got super
wasted as we both like lots of beer and

[54:46]
wasted as we both like lots of beer and
um and then we we had like we went to
steakhouse and had like i don't know one
of the
i don't know like men's talk in a way
just sitting there for three hours
talking about life and he's like to be
like i love that so much just playing a
game traveling the world and doing what

[55:00]
game traveling the world and doing what
i really love i want to do that for the
rest of my life and i'm like no i don't
want to do that not at all like just
like
and this is just how people are are
different and this is where throughout
there were many more lessons where it's
really that moment where you realize
okay what what is your what are your

[55:15]
okay what what is your what are your
actual goals like where's the
yeah where do feelings start to come in
for example and i always had that with
being home um i think like i lived in
vienna for a while and there is like um
it's the best city i've ever lived in

[55:30]
it's the best city i've ever lived in
and it's the greatest place and i would
uh highly recommend it to everyone but
it will never feel home for me which is
just like i don't know it's a it's a
feeling i don't know whether it comes
from the childhood or it's just someone
someone is like that some other is not
um so it's yeah

[55:46]
um so it's yeah
yeah so it sounds like you've got this
almost like sat nav system where you're
always listening to how you're feeling
in environments and rather than like
pre-judging you're almost curious oh why
am i feeling this way about this
situation like the bahamas one must have
been a bit of a red flag moment where

[56:00]
been a bit of a red flag moment where
you're like wait a second i should be
super excited to go to the bahamas why
am i not feeling that and rather than
trying to push through that that's a
good warning sign to listen wait a
second maybe i don't want to be
traveling as much maybe i want to be
home you're not judging it i think
that's a really uh again self-awareness
keeps coming up when i'm thinking about
how you're navigating your world yeah

[56:16]
how you're navigating your world yeah
it's really that i mean that it's i
really have that moment sometimes i
don't know whether you have that as well
that it's like that you know what you
want to say
but then already your your mind says
like it's it's like i want to express a
feeling right that was like that that

[56:30]
feeling right that was like that that
time of the year where you meet lots of
old good friends and like
people i can talk really honest with or
like it's like some others you you think
it through before what you what you
really say a little more and there's
like i i was just like talking from
ireland but this was a moment where like

[56:45]
ireland but this was a moment where like
can i really say that like even to a
good friend is it okay to just like be a
little whiny now about the problem of
flying to the bahamas where i decided
it's not okay um i still did but like
kept kept that in mind
yeah yeah i can get that it's always

[57:01]
yeah yeah i can get that it's always
trying to judge like the groups and the
environments are they almost ready for
this version of me can i just is this a
problem that they're going to uh reflect
on and obviously bahamas i'm not sure
many people would um classify that as a
problem like yeah i just turned on like
what a [ __ ] idiot talking to the next

[57:16]
what a [ __ ] idiot talking to the next
thing like
yeah yeah yeah yeah all right i quickly
want to segue into uh your background in
sport and how that came about it sounds
like it's always been a big part of your
life maybe competing with your brother
so yeah tommy through your kind of
background in sport which sports you

[57:31]
background in sport which sports you
like the most and did was any crossover
from the things you were learning in
sport that were useful for you as a
poker player
um i mean i always loved sports i was
not really good at it though um so just
on the local level so i started doing um

[57:45]
on the local level so i started doing um
track and field athletics um was the
first thing then i i played table tennis
and then it was like back and forth
playing football as well so uh the other
two things were like the main things
were i don't know age i don't know 10 to

[58:01]
were i don't know age i don't know 10 to
i was like winning lots of stuff in the
um like on local level in like athletics
just running and like jumping and all
kinds of stuff where there was the the
point with like 14 where all the others
of my age group um grew up firster uh

[58:18]
of my age group um grew up firster uh
faster so it was really like i was a kid
and then like running versus men or that
and they just like all of a sudden jump
a meter wider and then it stopped
winning where like i learned for the
first time okay then it's no fun anymore
for me pretty much so if i felt i tried

[58:32]
for me pretty much so if i felt i tried
maybe for another year and i was i was
like pretty much uh
starting very late to to then i mean i
was i was like you can't imagine now
with like uh me being pretty tall but
back then i was one of the of the small
guys um and was really that um

[58:47]
guys um and was really that um
yeah so i lost the fun for it pretty
much so then
i took that and put it more into table
tennis then where okay i succeeded up to
a certain level where like
i was never i was just before my for my

[59:00]
i was never i was just before my for my
local home clear i could go to the
yeah club one village further that is
like uh
i don't know their their first team
place second bundesliga or something and
they like are really putting putting
effort in their work with the the
young guys uh we're like i'm like no i

[59:16]
young guys uh we're like i'm like no i
just chill with my guys and we play like
the random [ __ ] league but we end up
winning it so it's like fine right it's
like it's like more
more like that and then same i mean
football i never grew up like playing

[59:30]
football i never grew up like playing
football for all the time so there was
no shot but i there was more for like
the people but then
i'm up for anything right it's now like
still for for vienna i like playing
volleyball basketball everything it's
like not that i i was really good at at

[59:45]
like not that i i was really good at at
anything it was just always a big part
of my life where i at least had like
five to six times a week
per week something something going um
and that is just something that
again like that reflecting at some point
in my life i thought about like why did
i never try to be better like really

[1:00:01]
i never try to be better like really
that what we described in the beginning
i just enjoyed like playing
other people that are not good and then
being slightly better uh just like with
that team it's just a yeah you go out
and celebrate and whether you do that
five leaks higher uh on another level

[1:00:16]
five leaks higher uh on another level
it's like whatever right it's like
really you can compare it to poker it's
like why not if you if you are enjoying
your home game round and you keep
winning there a little and play for it
for pennies and enjoy that's the perfect
thing just to stick to and uh and uh

[1:00:32]
thing just to stick to and uh and uh
yeah
in poker it took me that it's really
like bringing more things together than
that i guess my
um
yeah i
i mean it's like physics and not how you
say it uh like my

[1:00:45]
say it uh like my
what i'm good at it just fits way better
to poker than than two sports so it's
like idea i had a chance to really uh
succeed a little more um but yeah i
think that that all fits a little
together
yeah yeah i think it fits in nicely to

[1:01:00]
yeah yeah i think it fits in nicely to
your competitive nature and playing
board games with your brother sports
like one of the the best things we can
do when you get to compete and like you
said before you like to win i'm curious
to come back at some point to uh
understand how you deal with losses
because often i find people are highly

[1:01:15]
because often i find people are highly
competitive have struggles with losses
and and yeah basically the kind of
conflict of not winning it doesn't seem
like that holds true for you but we'll
explore that a little bit later yeah it
seems like your competitive nature has
kind of taken you uh down different
paths from like board games to sports
now to poker which is probably the

[1:01:31]
now to poker which is probably the
ultimate fit for your your personality
and your goals so yeah very interesting
this podcast is brought to you by poker
ambition where me and adam have created
our coaching program the mechanics of
poker after having reached highsex poker

[1:01:47]
poker after having reached highsex poker
ourselves we tested out this philosophy
on our cfp students which saw them rise
through the ranks and doubled their win
rate we then took the best knowledge of
that cfp program and turned it into the

[1:02:00]
that cfp program and turned it into the
mechanics of poker so you can have that
high quality content without the
long-term commitment and often hefty
price that comes with a cfp program now
i will be teaching you the technical
side of how poker really works how to

[1:02:15]
side of how poker really works how to
think about the game and how to
consistently get better and adam focuses
on the mindset and performance skills
you need to know in order to convert all
that technical poker knowledge into more
consistent profits at the table now this
program is high level it's made for

[1:02:31]
program is high level it's made for
professional poker players who have the
ambition to break free from mid stakes
and move up to high stakes poker so if

hour demo of everything that is inside
the program if you have any further
questions don't hesitate to reach out
but without further ado let's get back
to more goodness in this episode

[1:03:00]
to more goodness in this episode
renny i know you've been taking some
notes there i think you would dive with
any questions that we've been talking
about
it was funny that you that
that you actually said i don't want to
ask you in terms of losing because like
yeah it's very clear you like to win and
you try to stay sort of in your comfort

[1:03:17]
you try to stay sort of in your comfort
zone which
is in line with your values right
because you don't need necessarily
a very big inspiration the you don't
have the very big aspirations you don't
need 20 million to live the life that
you want to live for example um

[1:03:31]
you want to live for example um
is it is there something
inside of you
beyond that that indeed like if you
really push for it that you might not
succeed does that idea maybe scare you
and that's why you prefer to just you
know stay a bit more in your comfort
zone and just crush the people that you

[1:03:46]
zone and just crush the people that you
know you were gonna crush
not really um i think like
uh one thing i'm good at is is just
reframing things so it's like if i can
find a way to take uh to take it as a

[1:04:00]
find a way to take uh to take it as a
success it will be fine right so it's
like that maybe
uh like in in table tennis for example
like if
we were like one i mean sometimes we we
were like playing a league higher or two
just like after after a nice year of
success and then we just lost every

[1:04:16]
success and then we just lost every
match there then okay maybe you look a
little more at your
uh solo statistics right and then you
have something something there for it uh
maybe then there's other parts where
where you are somewhat successful or it
can make it a success in a way in your

[1:04:31]
can make it a success in a way in your
mind i remember the worst time of my
life clearly that i had um
that was when i had nothing else and was
just pretty much
taking my
joy or whatever is happening out of
poker that was um when i was injured and

[1:04:45]
poker that was um when i was injured and
couldn't do any sports uh so i had a
knee knee surgery and uh it was november
and i was already living in brighton and
i was there just like for flying there
and um playing for three three weeks
straight just like grinding it out every

[1:05:00]
straight just like grinding it out every
day and that came together with like uh
there wouldn't be a problem if things
are going well um but this was the only
thing i could take like my my not energy
from but like really what gives me
something there um
and then i was grinding every day and i
just kept losing was like one of my

[1:05:16]
just kept losing was like one of my
worst month even though i i put all the
effort in i think it was just a downer
and i think it was it was all fine but
then i i felt so miserable because it
was just like i couldn't go out and like
it could be a success just to go out and
do sports right whatever whatever it

[1:05:31]
do sports right whatever whatever it
happens there um or i don't know what
else like it's it's yeah any anything
could be something and there it was
yeah nothing i was like in a i mean we
didn't connect too well here we tried in
the beginning it but somehow didn't
manage to do so in in brighton so it was

[1:05:46]
manage to do so in in brighton so it was
pretty much me being there i don't know
whether some of the flatmates were there
as well um and i've like i felt so
miserable and this is something i
learned as well i just like need
multiple options that that make me happy
in a way and i can't rely on on the

[1:06:00]
in a way and i can't rely on on the
variants of poker it's like not just a
one thing where like whether it's a
relationship that is that is great or is
it like some kind of sports where you in
the beginning it was like sports was
going well where sports was going bad
and then uni was going well or just like

[1:06:15]
and then uni was going well or just like
something like something that you can
like look at and be happy about that was
i always wanted to have that and when
that is missing that
made me feel miser miserable in a way
yeah it's like if you're
too dependent on poker for your

[1:06:30]
too dependent on poker for your
all-around self-esteem or how you feel
about yourself or just feeling good and
when everything is dependent on poker
then when it doesn't go that well it
hurts you a lot whereas if you have
other things going on it's like oh yeah
poker didn't go so well but now i'm
gonna go have fun with my friends or in

[1:06:46]
gonna go have fun with my friends or in
my relationships or i go to play this
sport and you know
it's fine i also hear i don't know if
you if you've actively
practiced sort of mindfulness or if
you've read it i hear a lot of sort of
mindfulness principles also some stoic

[1:07:01]
mindfulness principles also some stoic
principles coming back in your stories
also like this basically you i wrote
down success is already inside of you
basically you don't need to prove it or
go challenge certain people
you know that if you
now want to feel successful or good

[1:07:16]
now want to feel successful or good
about yourself you can try you you can
find a reason why you're already
successful you can find a reason why
you're already happy with yourself and i
think a lot of people they kind of crave
that feeling right and they think it's
somewhere along the horizon oh if i
achieve this or if oh if i have to then

[1:07:31]
achieve this or if oh if i have to then
i will feel that way but i think what
you do very well is
you're indeed you know your values
you're very much in line with your
values you you don't let other people
kind of
judge you on your values and then doubt
your values right i can understand that

[1:07:45]
your values right i can understand that
compared to all the people you were
hanging out with they they really liked
that traveling right they would go to a
restaurant then you were the only one
who felt a bit awkward paying 200 for a
steak right that would be a situation
for example if you put me in a situation
i would probably
kind of go with the group

[1:08:01]
kind of go with the group
right and kind of put my values on on
the side
because that's kind of you know i wanna
i guess i find that they're more
important to fit in than to really stay
true to myself so i think that's
something that you do very well as well
uh this was just my my conclusion uh so

[1:08:17]
uh this was just my my conclusion uh so
far for from from what i'm hearing of
you i don't know if you is this
conscious or is just yeah i'm definitely
joining that group as well it's just
like it's not what i what i need like i
want to like for example on friday we go
to a very very special three-star

[1:08:31]
to a very very special three-star
restaurant here uh that i'm very much
looking looking forward to with a with a
great uh group but i want this to be a
special thing i like
i i want to still know what is
normal to people like what is what is
the what is the normal or like uh i mean

[1:08:47]
the what is the normal or like uh i mean
it's it's uh lots of people were
i think i always found that weird it's
it's true in a way but um like other um
other poker players in those interviews
they talk a lot about like their um

[1:09:01]
they talk a lot about like their um
friends or good friend here here and
there talking about all their poker
players yes i'm friends with most of the
german poker players
but i'm probably better friends with
like lots of like the people i know from
my hometown that i'm still

[1:09:15]
my hometown that i'm still
those are my best buddies and i feel
like those people who
don't have those
normal people around them and like their
only base or like their their their
friends is just all from that poker
bubble in a way
that that changes you in a way which i

[1:09:30]
that that changes you in a way which i
mean it's it's fine it's just different
right where for me it was always
important if i'm so connected to home
and i wanna i wanna still stay in touch
with those people and meet on a very
regular basis uh it's like it would be
very very weird right that uh like i

[1:09:45]
very very weird right that uh like i
mean i
i think i i mean stuff like i i could
make like a gazillion stories now but
that's like uh yeah that i think that's
the main thing
yeah again like i said something stowy
coming back that you shouldn't
even though you can you shouldn't overly

[1:10:01]
even though you can you shouldn't overly
spoil yourself for example with
three-star dinners because else it
doesn't feel special anymore
right
it's like the standard if you just do it
all the time then it's like yeah it's no
longer special so you you try to not do
things too much even though you could

[1:10:15]
things too much even though you could
to keep them special you know what in a
way but it's fun because it's one of the
special things right now what we we
started my wife and i we started doing
that during corona it's like after
ordering food so often just like really
taking time and cooking something nice

[1:10:30]
taking time and cooking something nice
it was like we we made like a journey
through the world uh and had like a um a
cooking date night like every friday and
we actually i i i put into i i taught
you her lots of randomized randomizing
so whenever we are unsure she's ready to
randomize stuff that's that's pretty

[1:10:46]
randomize stuff that's that's pretty
great so uh vacations are pretty
randomized sometimes and that is where
we had a box and we put like
um like names of countries in there just
like we were just like brainstorming and
every friday we just or like the week
before someone is responsible we draw

[1:11:00]
before someone is responsible we draw
like one thing and then it's like for
example brazil and then you have to do
something fancy pretty much referring to
that country where like
i mean i think that's like the most
normal thing in the world to be there
together in the kitchen cook something
and then have a nice dinner but like

[1:11:15]
and then have a nice dinner but like
that turned out to be something so
special really taking the time instead
of yeah let's order indian food tonight
let's order thai tonight let's order
this tonight because i don't know
whether it's too lazy or just like that
we're like
things can change where all of a sudden
the

[1:11:30]
the
easy normal stuff gets the special
things again yes yes
i definitely agree a lot of a lot of
wisdom
in there i want to quickly go back to
the time where you're playing the the
high rollers
and playing live

[1:11:46]
and playing live
um
you referred to when you were just
playing your zoom grind
that you
always had the ability even though it
didn't go so well for a short period you
could always zoom out and see that nice
big graph was that something that you

[1:12:00]
big graph was that something that you
had trouble with in tournaments
absolutely to keep you sane basically
absolutely like always that
yes i think i am good and like
the success of certain bodies gives me
the proof in a way because i think i'm
doing like i mean we are playing same

[1:12:15]
doing like i mean we are playing same
strategies if not a little deeper i'm
clearly making better decisions
and then yes um and then it's in the end
it's about two flips but saying that
over and over again after every trip
even though it's just like seven
tournaments or so

[1:12:30]
tournaments or so
gets annoying and then there's nothing
that i can rely on right let's say i
move up to 500 and i have in my back i
have a nice little 200k hands graph with
beating zoom 200 with 7 bb per 100 i
mean nothing can happen to me it's like
really that yeah i can always go back to

[1:12:46]
really that yeah i can always go back to
that uh and know like okay it's probably
not a not a big deal but then
never
like until a point never made any money
in in tournament poker even though
everyone is telling me hey no no it's
it's all great you're doing just wait

[1:13:00]
it's all great you're doing just wait
for it it's like
it's annoying because it's not natural
to me like i'm that yeah that i need
that correlation between good playing
and and getting getting a success out of
it um
or it's just i don't know whether i

[1:13:15]
or it's just i don't know whether i
could get used to it if i started with
that um i can see myself if i enjoyed
that a little more to just like grind
the daily tournament smaller fields then
and and like have that kind of zoom 200
graph then as well
just on on that level where if you only

[1:13:31]
just on on that level where if you only
show up for the series then play the
high events
sure i can evaluate
plays that people make and say like okay
we have a clear mistake here he's
blowing up here this is all stuff that
i'm not doing so i need to be a favorite
over them but

[1:13:45]
over them but
then it's like still okay we play a
freaking scoop main event with a
thousand people
am i going to win it or not it's
probably a lottery right in a way so
it's just like very very easy to run
that there for a while and
by never putting the sample in which is

[1:14:01]
by never putting the sample in which is
just not possible live um yeah i still
think i never like people think of me
that i'm
or i mean some live players think that
that i'm a bad main event player right i
never had any score in any kind of big

[1:14:15]
never had any score in any kind of big
field right yes i won some 40 players
sit and goes which doesn't mean anything
i personally think i'm a great main
event player just like taking so many
spots where i win 300 big plans where
others win a hundred i guess uh renee
definitely knows what i'm talking about

[1:14:30]
definitely knows what i'm talking about
there um it's of course if you have a
six you need to stack the five that's it
right so um
yeah and then like i i'm i'm looking
over the shoulders of buddies like
playing that stuff online like how can
you not go all in yeah but i'm only
betting that big because how why should
he call me and like yeah have you ever

[1:14:46]
he call me and like yeah have you ever
been bluffing that spot
no
good point and they're like okay you go
and get called by crazy [ __ ] all you
just like won three times the amount
it's like okay like stuff like that
where i think what is my best i think is
like a 41st place in something where i

[1:15:02]
like a 41st place in something where i
don't know other buddies have like ept
title here uh final table uh left and
right and uh yeah i actually what is
what is fun i think i've
i think i'm actually pretty good but
everyone says that um

[1:15:16]
everyone says that um
in in
in evaluating good and bad run so it's
it's really that i think i have one big
upside where i ran as hot as no one else
in his career

[1:15:30]
in his career
and that is uh the
the uh how it looked like when play is
streamed
so whenever i was sitting on a stream
final table or like anything streamed i
look like a freaking genius it's like
every bluff catch i made their lifetime

[1:15:47]
every bluff catch i made their lifetime
was good
and every fancy
too thin value bet or random over bed
exploitative got called it's like really
that and the other part is okay if i got
it in
i lost and it's like okay out again with

[1:16:01]
i lost and it's like okay out again with
a big flip or getting sucked out and
we're like it's like always looking
great on stream where i think like uh
people watching that had a very very
high opinion of me where obviously i'm
blowing up left and right on outer
tables as well and i would on the stream
as well but it's like that is just the

[1:16:15]
as well but it's like that is just the
bad or good run where actually if you if
you like the bad run side i think is
really that
making money myself with tournaments
never worked out too well because i was
very very conscious and planned with my
investments there as well if you look

[1:16:30]
investments there as well if you look
through the
the hand and mop i have and evaluate
the toughness of the tournaments i
always won the toughest tournaments
which at this at the same time means i
didn't have a big piece right so it's
like for example poker masters everyone

[1:16:45]
like for example poker masters everyone
was talking about that was 36 players i
guess um throughout the series and like
two semi-fish that are not too bad like
like
yeah don't want to call out names but it
was like that like some some big whales

[1:17:01]
was like that like some some big whales
were not not coming and it was really
that yes it was ray creed that makes it
good but it was a rec fest of regulus
that's it so i'm as i am just like had a
very very small piece what no one uh
sees is like so yeah i mean you can
guess that's not the most money i made

[1:17:16]
guess that's not the most money i made
there but the most prestige in a way uh
and then the next week i just pinked a
500 w coupe tournament which no one sees
in this world for pretty much the same
amount that i won in poker masters where
it's like it's just we're like i

[1:17:30]
it's like it's just we're like i
obviously just play on i maybe had a
five percent swap with a buddy that was
uh that was cheering me on but it's like
like stuff like that and this is
something just to evaluate that where um
and you could do that same for other
players where fedor i think or other of

[1:17:45]
players where fedor i think or other of
the the heaters like justin bonimo maybe
dan coleman it was not them having that
heater that they win everything but it's
like really that they win everything
after another so ever every time you are
overconfident slightly and willing to

[1:18:00]
overconfident slightly and willing to
invest more to then win again is just
like the biggest teacher of all times
right it's like so easy to lose stuff
back but if you have that like three
four in a row and you feel invincible uh
then this is this is where the heal
real heater is in ways so that's like um

[1:18:17]
real heater is in ways so that's like um
fun as well in a way in a way to look at
i mean i'm sure there's a lot of people
that think something that had the same
mentality okay and now i'm going to take
a very big piece of myself they break
the next 10 tournaments and we don't

[1:18:30]
the next 10 tournaments and we don't
hear of them anymore right that's always
the the catch with these like what you
were looking out always sunday night in
the cash game table someone just uh
getting i don't know fifth in the sunday
million uh feeling like being the best
poker player in the world just getting
unlucky to only finish fifth you know

[1:18:45]
unlucky to only finish fifth you know
10k is a nice limit to start trying
again so um yeah yes
yes yes
it's it's quite interesting right for
example
uh if i go to your wikipedia page it
indeed says like stefan sondheimer won

[1:19:01]
indeed says like stefan sondheimer won
3.6 million 10 million lifetime earnings
in general i think in tournament world
you know they have like this big braggy
stars well 20 million lifetime earnings
i'm like yeah okay earnings are yeah you
know where where's the profit right and

[1:19:15]
know where where's the profit right and
indeed like you you don't know in the in
the world i remember i think i heard a
podcast with fedor as well where he was
talking about that he had some trouble
he felt like he couldn't complain
because the outside world thought he had
the best year ever but in buying pieces
how much pieces he had in his winnings

[1:19:31]
how much pieces he had in his winnings
he actually ended up down
which is really weird because then you
cannot complain to the world because the
world thinks what are you complaining
about you pinged all this tournament how
it does does it feel weird in a way when
people say like oh yeah you won the 3.6
million is it like yeah not really

[1:19:45]
million is it like yeah not really
actually yeah how does that feel that's
i mean it's like i had uh i was i was
whining a little on twitter that one
year after the million one drop and then
there was like big headlines in like the
media uh german pro losing 2.1 million

[1:20:00]
media uh german pro losing 2.1 million
in vegas we're like yes uh i don't know
whether that maybe 1.8 i don't know like
one part with a one million tournament
we're like you can guess i i i didn't
have the biggest piece of myself in that
one
but uh yeah i mean that's just what it
is it's uh again for some people that

[1:20:15]
is it's uh again for some people that
are important to you you can take some
time and explain it and for some others
it's just what it is right if someone uh
puts my name into google and thinks i'm
i'm like i have 14 13 or something
million
okay let him think that it's okay i

[1:20:30]
okay let him think that it's okay i
don't care
going back to i've actually thought it
was quite
if i thought it made a lot of sense that
in tournaments
uh
you
might not feel as confident in the long
run than in cash games right if you
would have grinded and lead your way up

[1:20:47]
would have grinded and lead your way up
in tournaments you built a certain
identity for yourself like i am a
tournament crusher and then no matter if
a downswing hits you have something to
fall back on no crushing tournaments
that's what i do whereas if you did not
put in that sample

[1:21:00]
put in that sample
those years before like you did in cash
then if you know things don't go that
well even though rationally speaking you
know you know you make better plays and
you know you play the same strategies as
your buddies around you are winning and
you get confirmation still inside of you
you know your identity is not irish
tournaments it that it's just not

[1:21:16]
tournaments it that it's just not
possible and maybe this is also
you know some of your strengths were
indeed that you have a lot of
self-awareness you control your ego well
you know you're you're good in game
selection except for that tournament
that you actually ended up thinking
which you know
uh that helped you well in that case but

[1:21:32]
uh that helped you well in that case but
in a way also the self-awareness
and not having that big ego and going
after that big win also holds you back a
little bit at this at this point i guess
sorry i said it again i just didn't
didn't get it

[1:21:45]
didn't get it
so
normally your self-awareness and the
fact that you control your ego well
helps you in your career right you play
it safe
whereas in tournaments maybe if other
people around me would say wow you're so
good you might take a little bit of a
more aggressive shot you know you might
write that ego a little bit more so in a

[1:22:01]
write that ego a little bit more so in a
way that you're being a bit risk-averse
in that area kind of holds you back
yeah i mean it's just that i i need to
figure like that is important for me
always to figure things out by myself
what we said is like totally true like i
you feel like okay i'm a cash game

[1:22:15]
you feel like okay i'm a cash game
player there uh i went through those
downswings that it's mainly the
experience missing as well like if i
went through that downswing like three
years before and two years before as
well and then like you have that
positive attitude about that and and
there i really always had that i'm not

[1:22:31]
there i really always had that i'm not
really sure maybe it's then even maybe
it's the life component maybe some
people see something we're like okay uh
by talking honestly with feeder he's
like no not a [ __ ] right it's like don't
worry about it but still like all that
confirmation it's not it's different

[1:22:45]
confirmation it's not it's different
outside confirmation is is different
than when you are 100 convinced yourself
so it's uh it's like what really helps
me there is to really evaluate
what like can you name it what you do
better better than others that's like
and this is what i get like really

[1:23:01]
and this is what i get like really
teaming up there
watching others play and like just
seeing them making random or definitely
bad moves where like i just
know potentially the theory behind it
better i know other things may be better
um
and then that's like okay he's winning

[1:23:16]
and then that's like okay he's winning
i clearly play a better strategy so it's
like just a logical thing that it that
should work out but uh you never know
right and then it's like you have that
kind of [ __ ] talk about okay but
he's so good exploitative we're like
everyone who says that i'm like not a

[1:23:31]
everyone who says that i'm like not a
hundred percent sure of um we're like
yes
it's definitely a plus that you know all
the players right those people grinding
their hearts out let's shout out to pats
like who is sharing everything on
twitter and instagram maybe like every
single day against those players that

[1:23:46]
single day against those players that
show up i feel it now i just playing a
little challenge some zoom 200 again
whatever is possible here from germany
you know how people play if you play
them every freaking day right and if you
are somewhat smarter or one level higher
sometimes

[1:24:00]
sometimes
you will figure more out about them than
the other way around so it's just that
that gives you something where like yes
if someone is going there to an ept main
event and i just see like okay i have
two russians uh two spain yards and and
one french guy there and reiner kempi is
going there and knows like yeah this guy

[1:24:16]
going there and knows like yeah this guy
is always doing this this guy is always
doing this i played them in all the one
case in my life before
obviously that's a big advantage right
so it's like um yeah that's that's
that kind of stuff where always i always
was a little self-critical or not a

[1:24:30]
was a little self-critical or not a
hundred percent sure and uh yeah
definitely didn't didn't let like the
the uh
like good words from others affect my my
decisions there too much to like i was
never actually never investing too much
then

[1:24:46]
i think it's there's a very big
difference between indeed like
rationally speaking knowing everything
but like in your gut you know that that
intuition about how the how the pools
usually play in a certain spot how this
guy will approach us but you know you're
just rationalizing it away with logic

[1:25:01]
just rationalizing it away with logic
but it doesn't feel the same you know as
having that
i know i played with this guy over and
over i'm 100 sure uh i'm going to make
this exactly and just like i played i
don't know
a couple of ten thousand hands the last
week and have exactly that feeling i go

[1:25:15]
week and have exactly that feeling i go
into the zoom200 pool and feel like yeah
most of those
wrecks
and i have those seen most of those
names five years ago already they didn't
change their play style too much
probably so they will be value heavy but
always with a big if like they will be

[1:25:30]
always with a big if like they will be
value heavy in big spots always
and now i'm looking at it like
he has it i'm not calling a single
catcher here but it's like no doubt at
all right it's just like that that
switch of things that always lots of

[1:25:45]
switch of things that always lots of
lots of doubts in my in my head in the
whole tournament world definitely
how do you uh how do you do that because
you go on twitch you play people she see
you playing

[1:26:00]
you playing
you from what i can tell are quite
transparent in terms of you
literally say what you're thinking i
have a feeling you don't hold much
information back
um
and you for example when i when i twitch
i get quite paranoid in sharing exactly

[1:26:17]
i get quite paranoid in sharing exactly
what i think especially when it comes
out to read some pools read some players
et cetera how do you do that like you
make a very exploit default and just be
like yeah he doesn't bluff here
knowing that he's gonna see that yeah
that freak you out now that doesn't hurt
me at all it's like really that it's

[1:26:31]
me at all it's like really that it's
like
i love making fun of those players as
well so it's like really that maybe i i
give up a little dollar eb here for
having some funny bee um
because it's just i mean if someone
especially when i've seen a name five

[1:26:45]
especially when i've seen a name five
years ago or already and he's still
playing that same style on 200
he won't change it's like always
you are thinking then probably in a way
as if you were watching yourself and you
can make all those conclusions what that
means if someone is playing 2117 six

[1:27:02]
means if someone is playing 2117 six
percent three bet and then one dollar
after that river on the showdown of like
72 um
no he doesn't know that bluffing is a
thing in poker right it's like he won't
see that oh next time i bluff him like

[1:27:16]
see that oh next time i bluff him like
no it's like not you can't like i can
watch cristiano ronaldo make a nice free
kick
and how he did it but i won't like no
it's not in me i i just can't un
unfortunately right um

[1:27:30]
unfortunately right um
so it's it's like that in a way
obviously you're giving away something
to to smart players right but they
against them you are anyways like trying
to to like
you're not on the most exploitative
level you both try to like not make
mistakes in a way so

[1:27:45]
mistakes in a way so
yeah so basically you're you're not
going to make as big exploits
on higher stakes
than lower stakes 5k so basically not
no i that was actually my follow-up
question would it be different

[1:28:00]
question would it be different
but sometimes i try to make a good job
of not showing that but if i make
ridiculous faults i mean i i did like i
did lots of calls that i would fold off
stream
um
yeah i know i'm guilty of that we're
like and like uh and i get the message

[1:28:16]
like and like uh and i get the message
from from tutti for example oh you made
that just for the stream we're like
folding all day long and i'm like and
i'm in stream yeah it's like close the
read is not strong enough i think we
still have to call that even though he's
like and i'm like yes kind of finding an

[1:28:30]
like and i'm like yes kind of finding an
explanation around it that like i i
bring over to the audience that i know
he has it but no way i'm folding that
where in real life like sometimes i'm
doing that just like pulling the table
away click on the fold button and not
talk about it anymore um and

[1:28:47]
talk about it anymore um and
then like sometimes i'm just like i mean
it's i'm not making things where i'm 100
sure then i'm
i'm doing it right and i don't care but
if it's like yes he has like i mean i
remember one hand what was it um

[1:29:00]
remember one hand what was it um
yeah someone is like big blind three
betting and he has like his six seven
percent there against the button
something like that we get a ten high
board
uh he's his c-bets
and he bought it sorry
uh no that's that would be good but i

[1:29:15]
uh no that's that would be good but i
have jax he see that's like half part uh
10-7-3 turn is a four and then he check
jams we're like i'm saying that yes he
can include ace 10 as a value hand in
there but in real life
i where now i'm folding my jacks there
just like i mean we i i i told like he

[1:29:32]
just like i mean we i i i told like he
has the kings without the flush draw he
did have the kings without the flush
draw it's so nice that you can call out
the hands all the time but like stuff
like that we're like yes it's like
not a hundred percent sure but uh yeah

[1:29:45]
not a hundred percent sure but uh yeah
but i i guess that's like what you get
used to when when streaming and it's
really like to make the toughest or
craziest things it's it's just
yeah it's something that before you turn
on go live you already accept that
something like this is gonna happen but

[1:30:00]
something like this is gonna happen but
it's really weird like i would have made
a call
just because
i don't want to explain exactly how i
think about the spot i'm just going to
call because i don't have a better
argument i cannot explain the better
than the one that i don't want to
explain it's not the worst thing in the
world to tell everyone yeah it's totally

[1:30:16]
world to tell everyone yeah it's totally
standard you got a bad call that here
because
i mean it's fine
and this is why we're i mean you are
streaming 500 i i can't even see the
lobby unfortunately so that i can afford
the the 200 to give up it's and it's not
like you're giving like 200 eb up there

[1:30:31]
like you're giving like 200 eb up there
or like whatever the bet is 100 no yeah
enemy for example i do sometimes a
stream three-handed 2k for example
a forehand at 2k and there it's like
but the players that i then play against

[1:30:45]
but the players that i then play against
i'm not going to do any it's exactly
what you said i'm not going to radically
like they're not very much over bluffing
very much on their bluffing they're
going to be closer to gto so i'm going
to call losers
then and not like 20 so it's like okay
exactly so it feels a little bit uh

[1:31:03]
exactly so it feels a little bit uh
it feels a little bit better uh
one point that i wrote down was that you
mentioned in when you were playing these
live events that you were swapping and
buying action in other players where

[1:31:16]
buying action in other players where
your normal grind you know playing it
safe having a lot of control
uh comes back how
was that when you were suddenly buying
pieces everywhere and people were going
on huge downward things and it was not
in your control anymore basically
normally you would maybe say oh i lost

[1:31:30]
normally you would maybe say oh i lost
quite a lot maybe take a step back but
no they keep on firing you have
percentages i never bought pieces
because i can't take it
it's like it's
i mean it's i'm not a tournament player
i cannot evaluate that if someone says
it tells me yell it's that whole bigger

[1:31:46]
it tells me yell it's that whole bigger
schedule that markup i cannot evaluate
it just like it's not
so everything i invest in is just the
tournaments i play myself
so i have kind of a rating i know the
play that's like those short uh like um

[1:32:00]
play that's like those short uh like um
a few player fields and um and
that's it right so and i play against
them myself and i can
like guess more or less how our eyes
look like so it's mainly just swapping
to just um
increase your your overall exposure a

[1:32:16]
increase your your overall exposure a
little on the tournament when you want
to have that um and and that's about it
i was never that guy like let's go you
play the main event you play the main
event i buy 50 like not at all i just
because i'm not a tournament player um

[1:32:30]
because i'm not a tournament player um
it's it's exactly so it's purely you
you're like okay i cannot evaluate the
ev if my investment sorry i don't like
it like this is the nittiness right
we're like i'm probably it's it's
probably it's plasticy but i don't know
for sure and i need to know for sure

[1:32:45]
that's indeed very interesting because i
can imagine that if you know again
you're in that circle people are winning
left and right and you have the access
to buy action of them
you know as a direct friend first access
baby i it's again i think it's i mean

[1:33:01]
baby i it's again i think it's i mean
that's i mean
right it's like that i'm not it's not
like i'm i had more monies than other
that's mainly the case when you start
buying the action we're like yes if like
i'm not buying the ex it's like okay
fidor is buying the action or whoever's
behind is buying the action so it's like

[1:33:15]
behind is buying the action so it's like
i'm not yeah you get it sold anyways if
someone has like
struggles to get it sold and i'm like
yeah i'm sure it's like and it's the
same tournament i play that was my rule
just tournaments i play and then i i
take another piece like that's not the
problem but um yeah

[1:33:31]
problem but um yeah
was never never a big investor
all right well
you you've had uh quite the story uh uh
quite the right
mr mr guscore
if you it's reflecting on it you know

[1:33:46]
if you it's reflecting on it you know
yeah
i mean it it it's exactly what you said
right it was in line with your goals it
helped you here and there it maybe
stopped you here and there but in the
end you're happy with your choices than
where you are now so in my you you got
the stamp succeeded

[1:34:00]
the stamp succeeded
succeeded in poker that's that worked
out quite quite fine
if you if you if you look back
at the at this uh at your whole career
what is like
the most important thing that you
learned throughout uh throughout

[1:34:16]
learned throughout uh throughout
everything that you've experienced oh
that's a very very tough question i mean
pretty much those life values knowing
knowing what you want in life that's
like i guess the biggest
success you can have that it's like i
mean
i still feel
pretty young

[1:34:32]
pretty young
with 31 i hope there's lots of life
ahead and like having a rough idea how
you want to
live those next i don't know 50 good
years and maybe some more that are not
too great let's see um
is is pretty nice instead of like being

[1:34:47]
is is pretty nice instead of like being
caught somewhere uh like searching for
what you want to do like being i mean
how much time do we have the last 10
years thinking about that stuff for
example
people being caught in in uni and then
in a job and like having their daily

[1:35:00]
in a job and like having their daily
life they
it takes them a cup like way more years
uh just to like think stuff like that
through and like build that it's not
only thinking it through once and then
just knowing it's that that
repetition of like really just like

[1:35:15]
repetition of like really just like
getting that
um
yeah just like just getting those those
feelings that this is right what you
think and like then then having the
bigger picture uh i think this is this
is the clear thing um
yeah i think in in

[1:35:30]
yeah i think in in
i see this a lot in poker because of how
fast we can make progress in our careers
you kind of everyone hits like an early
midlife crisis you know which normally
in normal career paths people hit when
they're like 50s we hit it at like in
our 30s which is a

[1:35:45]
our 30s which is a
huge
a a huge edge compared to the rest of
the world right because now you can
based on everything that you learned so
fast and learned about yourself you can
live the majority of your life in line
with those values right
absolutely yeah

[1:36:00]
absolutely yeah
i mean it's just
it's i i don't know it's so
uh
it's like those those talks like when
when when i sit there with my wife and
we talk about the future and what our
plans are i would like to see those kind
of talks

[1:36:16]
of talks
from other people right where like
um i think i i kind of
like put her a little in my direction
and she she took me a little in her
direction uh i mean she's not a poker
player so

[1:36:30]
player so
um and uh and yeah i think this has has
to look very very different just like
like for the the vast majority of of of
uh of people just like planning their
future because there's no room for
planning no way less options they are

[1:36:45]
planning no way less options they are
stuck in something and this is just uh
yeah so so much freedom that
i'm super happy with and and super super
thankful for
i think you do need to reach a certain
point in your career because you know if
we would have had this conversation five

[1:37:01]
we would have had this conversation five
years ago six years ago or if you would
have this conversation with me very
focused on achieving a certain amount of
success or you want to read certain
goals and it's only after you reset that
you feel like you have the time to
reflect
yeah

[1:37:16]
yeah
i mean if if we if we travel
back in time like five years it's you
get like totally different answers to
everything um just like then what was it
start of
2017 oh i was i would still be whining

[1:37:31]
2017 oh i was i would still be whining
about the downswing end of 2016. i would
still praise the 5k city goes on stars
and i would hope like that 2017 things
will have finally to change because how
how bad can you run or for how long can
you run bad in live poker and then we

[1:37:46]
you run bad in live poker and then we
turn out that uh 2017 will be a great
year so uh yeah i hope for you too
adam would you like to to share your
thoughts on this on the

[1:38:01]
thoughts on this on the
the biggest lesson that he learned yeah
yeah so i'm getting a lot of lessons
that seem very powerful from you uh the
self-awareness is just
a big trendline throughout this
conversation and another thing that was
really interesting is your kind of

[1:38:15]
really interesting is your kind of
ability to reframe it's really i think
me and renee both came into this
conversation trying to uh pick some
obstacles from you some challenges that
you faced but that's hard for you to ben
answer because you instantly reframe it
as a positive so we can't even hit an
obstacle because your mind's already
reframed that as a win and a positive

[1:38:32]
reframed that as a win and a positive
thing which is an amazing superpower
because life's not really obstacles it's
like neutral situations that we frame as
an obstacle which then needs to be
solved you you skip that phase and you
instantly or you try to reframe
situations as a positive which i think's

[1:38:45]
situations as a positive which i think's
an amazing skill set it's amazing for
people listening to think about how they
can reframe their situations in a more
positive way we have so much leeway to
do that we can choose different angles
if we like you said with your poker
results looking you'd often zoom out and
look at your big graph we always have

[1:39:01]
look at your big graph we always have
the ability to zoom out and look at the
bigger picture so uh yeah i'm getting
this kind of big picture perspective
self-awareness the ability to reframe
which i would call perspective the
perspective skill sets uh yeah really
really interesting to hear how you've
been able to use those to uh from my
perspective have less

[1:39:16]
perspective have less
challenges or less big obstacles that
other players would normally have
normally we have a bit of a train wreck
scenario with ups and downs and backs
and forths you've navigated the highs
and lows of the poker world
smoother than most people i think it's a
testament to those those skills you've

[1:39:31]
testament to those those skills you've
developed so uh yeah i'm just gonna fire
some quick fire questions which i've had
in my mind um going into this
conversation then running i'm just
guessing you've got some random
questions as well so first of all when
you are your best what does that look
like you could apply it to your daily

[1:39:45]
like you could apply it to your daily
habits or when you're your best self
what does that journey look like for you
um
[Music]
that's interesting um how it looks like
probably
sitting there actually and not the most
relaxed posture and um it's like i have

[1:40:01]
relaxed posture and um it's like i have
that thing like no other things in mind
that's like something that's
that's really holding me back and uh
what i think that is as advice for for
lots of others as well is that um

[1:40:15]
lots of others as well is that um
that talking about what you're doing
helps a lot just like to put like
to think thoughts to the end um i'm not
necessarily talking while playing
that can happen just inside your head as
well but really

[1:40:30]
well but really
having that ability of free free mind to
really
think things
to the end where like i feel that when
i'm not like in the like not performing
the best and then review it and like
what have i thought here uh or just like
click on something and have that one
second later that maybe that was not the

[1:40:46]
second later that maybe that was not the
best and this is some sometimes i feel
like yesterday for example i recorded a
a video for poker code just a live play
and there i um
i just felt it before i want to talk
about what i'm doing here right now

[1:41:00]
about what i'm doing here right now
right it was like one where i was
talking about exploits now i have some
summer experience with the players i
played in the last week and uh and now i
can finally say something what i think
about then and i'm happy to do so we're
like hey i play this table and i want to
articulate where my ev is coming from

[1:41:16]
articulate where my ev is coming from
right it's like i want to again in a
hand for example i try to zoom out what
is like that from just a theory
perspective what is this spot okay i
have a pure bluff catcher with those two
cards mean this and this is the player
type i'm facing so whatever is my

[1:41:31]
type i'm facing so whatever is my
absolute hand strength it ends up being
a fold probably right uh i have this and
that and this is where my eb comes from
we're like hey um but i remember a hand
yes from yesterday as well we're like
hey
i turn the freaking straight in a

[1:41:46]
i turn the freaking straight in a
three-bed pot i'm like yes that's a high
frequency check here to protect my range
i know this guy is never bluffing so
what is the exploit here i get the money
from just like
getting money from his from his draws
and his his weaker value and so i'm just

[1:42:00]
and his his weaker value and so i'm just
splashing it through myself we're like
just really articulating that makes it
sound so easy at the same time which
that's why lots of people i guess love
the youtube videos or or the stream to
just like present it in an easy way that
everything makes sense but it helps

[1:42:16]
everything makes sense but it helps
yourself the most actually um and this
is yeah maybe a good description that
really i have the time and freedom in my
brain to really have that have that talk
in there if i'm not speaking it out loud

[1:42:32]
in there if i'm not speaking it out loud
yeah is there anything you do on a daily
weekly basis to provide that space for
yourself so you can consistently show up
as that version of yourself
i mean right now not at all because
since june i'm not really i cannot grind
from germany that's the big problem so

[1:42:46]
from germany that's the big problem so
like and now for zoom 200 i don't
introduce like big routines but uh
usually when i play real sessions at the
first thing that no session gets started
before the last one is reviewed that's
just like
uh even if it's just a short thing that

[1:43:00]
uh even if it's just a short thing that
helps poker wise to get things that
might still be stuck there from the past
and even if it's just like three loss
flips that helps me to get them out
there and then you are free where like i
mean one basic rule that i'm not
following up with but helps me a lot
when i do so is just uh the very very

[1:43:16]
when i do so is just uh the very very
basic rule of life that
everything you can do in less than five
minutes do it now and we're like that's
a pretty good thing we're like before
our uh our call here uh i actually
needed to make appointments with a
physiotherapist this is one call but

[1:43:31]
physiotherapist this is one call but
this is something that is in the back of
my mind for now three days or it's not
right so i did it at like we met at 10
so i did it at like 9 45 i still called
there and just get it done like just
those things trying to do that before a
session were as i said i'm it's easy to

[1:43:46]
session were as i said i'm it's easy to
say right now i'm not doing that at all
because i
i chill play a little zoom 200 do a
little coaching do something here and
it's like it's not really i don't need
to perform on the highest level right
now but this is something that uh maybe
in the future when i when i grind a

[1:44:00]
in the future when i when i grind a
little more again from when i'm in
vienna or so i try to to have those
habits for sure
yeah awesome so on your pocket journey
what have been some of the uh
more powerful character traits you've
had to develop it feels like from the

[1:44:16]
had to develop it feels like from the
outside you're going into poker you
already had quite
good clear values that you understood
you were very competitive going into
poker what did you have to learn on the
poker journey that you maybe weren't
good at originally or was like a new

[1:44:30]
good at originally or was like a new
skill set that you had to learn the hard
way or the fast way
career does anything come to mind um
two things yeah so one thing that that
it helped me a lot with this i mean
mainly just through the success i guess
but like self-esteem i was one i mean
you can imagine i told you before from

[1:44:46]
you can imagine i told you before from
like sports that i was always one of the
small guys like growing up to men is
like one of the latest i guess everyone
has has had those in in their in their
uh youth around them as well where like
uh that like puts you into that position
of like getting kind of a shy person

[1:45:01]
of like getting kind of a shy person
maybe a little
of like being a little not not sure
about things um and i'm definitely
definitely that where like i remember
that was interesting when my my wife had
one one day told me it's like
it's insane when i hear you talk with

[1:45:16]
it's insane when i hear you talk with
like
poker people
you are just like a different person
because that's just like
different conversations were like kind
of
i'm the boss in a way we're like
there's nothing you can you can't shake

[1:45:30]
there's nothing you can you can't shake
me off with like poker anything right i
guess uh i guess renee and i we can talk
on like a high level about all kinds of
strategy but it's like there won't be
anything
new there will be interesting things but
like it's like yes it's like i feel so

[1:45:46]
like it's like yes it's like i feel so
so much confidence in something that i
obviously do not have in any other part
of life i never i don't have another
part of life that i studied as much as i
studied poker so it's just a natural
thing
and the other thing is uh that kind of

[1:46:00]
and the other thing is uh that kind of
accepting that people are very different
it's like i gave see there was the most
interesting interview i ever gave to
someone from the
seventh grade from my hometown school
because it was so easy childish
questions
and really thinking about them on a

[1:46:15]
and really thinking about them on a
deeper level was very interesting and it
was like one of the questions was
what do i need to be good at to make it
to the point where you are and there i
was really thinking
he was more talking about school
subjects but um it's more like really

[1:46:32]
subjects but um it's more like really
that thinking okay who is there in the
high roller world and we have very very
different people i know some of the
german crew
i mean they struggle adding 17 and 28.
right it's like not the the analytical

[1:46:46]
right it's like not the the analytical
math type of people who just don't need
a second for that it's like really it's
insane how bad you can be with numbers
and still succeed in poker some others
are like very very talented in a
communicative way uh just like making

[1:47:00]
communicative way uh just like making
friends with people getting in the right
circles
maybe even life game selection in a way
getting into nice cash games or is
something on the side um
like for me that would be acting some
you obviously have those type of
super geeks kind of you could they if

[1:47:16]
super geeks kind of you could they if
they end up like being a math student
they will do their professor or
something and then end up in like just
like geeking in another area that you
can really dive deep into and then you
have like kind kind of those
all-rounders i don't know how to

[1:47:30]
all-rounders i don't know how to
describe reiner in mind right now right
not not a math talent uh not like i
don't know but like he's kind of like
out of the streets kind of right like
just like knowing how things are working
and uh and like
so different characters and before that

[1:47:46]
so different characters and before that
i was like more
centered around my ideas like okay you
need to maximize eb this is the strategy
this is what you need to do and this is
the only way how it works so really that
more open-mindedness regarding how
things can work and and that different

[1:48:01]
things can work and and that different
perspectives can be totally fine where
now i experience that a lot
when i do coachings with especially
people that got coached from other
players before like really um
yeah i have one in mind that just had

[1:48:15]
yeah i have one in mind that just had
someone who was working a lot with mass
data analysis analysis and like
that coaching must have been like
programming a bot in a way it's like
yeah there you just always bet 30
because this is what works instead of
right i try to make people understand

[1:48:30]
right i try to make people understand
with analogies and and nice and easy to
understand images um where like he was
just like he could probably
put it on paper what his strategy is
without telling him why or it couldn't
even explain it right it's like um and

[1:48:45]
even explain it right it's like um and
obviously those people can be very
successful in poker too um and this is
just like being open-minded regarding
that uh that was i guess the second big
thing
yeah awesome yeah i think poca makes you
realize that people are very different

[1:49:00]
realize that people are very different
and there's no like in a right or wrong
way and like we said earlier in the
conversation we're all trying to get the
different outcomes so obviously
different personality types and
different ways of doing things are going
to get us different outcomes yeah i
think it's always good to reflect that
maybe alway isn't not the only way but

[1:49:16]
maybe alway isn't not the only way but
it might not be like just the best way
there's so many different ways to go
about getting to an outcome even with
poker and like very finite solutions in
a way there's so many different ways you
can play a spot and get a certain
outcome so yeah i think it's really
it's a lesson in different personality

[1:49:30]
it's a lesson in different personality
types and i know myself like i used to
always struggle with people who weren't
logical enough if someone was too
emotional
like all right just stop the emotions
let's get to logic and i used to try to
think that they were wrong and i was
right and i had to kind of teach them
how to think logically and then now as i

[1:49:45]
how to think logically and then now as i
understand people more like ah that was
just me not listening i just didn't
understand how to hold space for an
emotion so i would just try to refrain
the situation that they're wrong and i'm
right yeah i think poka has got so many
personalities from gto people to feel
people there's different types of people
who see the world differently i think

[1:50:01]
who see the world differently i think
that it's a great lesson to accept that
people are different i think once you do
get to that point you realize you can
learn so much from often people are very
different often you can learn more from
those people in the past few years i've
learned a lot more from people are very
different to me whereas maybe earlier in

[1:50:15]
different to me whereas maybe earlier in
my life i've maybe challenged myself
towards people who are very similar just
learn from peer groups but recently i've
learned a lot more from people who are
different to me because they stress my
ideas and often tell me how silly i am
how wrong i am but that gets me to
reflect on where i am and yeah it's a
more balanced perspective at the end of

[1:50:31]
more balanced perspective at the end of
it
so just one quick new story you go sorry
oh yeah see i mean renee before we got
on the conversation we both noted
separately that you're very good at
asking questions it seems that you're
very good at asking yourself questions
and reflecting has that always been

[1:50:46]
and reflecting has that always been
something that you would say you are
good at or have you been able to uh
fine-tune that skill set of maybe going
internal to ask questions or even
seeking questions outside does that mean
something that you've been
able to fine tune
um
i think that was somehow just the or i

[1:51:02]
i think that was somehow just the or i
don't know where it comes from it's like
really that analytical way i always um
did like lots of lots of teaching like
even that that guy who is like where i
thought about how can you explain things
and uh and like just being that guy who
helped others in like seventh grade with

[1:51:16]
helped others in like seventh grade with
math like talking about that and um and
this is something that i guess teaches
that skill a little because for me it's
just like
everyone knows all that stuff it's
insane i can have you can get bring me
your worst student and i try like it's

[1:51:31]
your worst student and i try like it's
just whatever your brain is thinking
through is just triggered by the right
questions you ask and sometimes the
are just very very easy you just need to
ask them we're like i remember now math
back in school where like you have a

[1:51:45]
back in school where like you have a
yeah a little little task where like a
story is told and then you need to find
something out like i don't know timmy
meets adam and they do this and that
with that and like it's there's not like
the clearest question of all times and
you need to figure it
out yourself where some people sit in

[1:52:00]
out yourself where some people sit in
front of that and like i have no clue
what i should do right because it's not
like
it's not the framework it's not like
there's just a math equation and they
need to solve it there are some people
who can do that um
but this is always that yeah just ask
the questions and this is again bringing

[1:52:15]
the questions and this is again bringing
back to just speaking it out loud like
what are you thinking about now it's
it's it's it's really so helpful and
then i see it like um
yeah we can talk about that in any poker
spot like oh i have no no clue what flop
sizing to use here yes let's think about

[1:52:30]
sizing to use here yes let's think about
it what makes sense does a small sizing
make sense what do you hurt in villains
range using that
well does a big sizing make sense what
is like the problem here and there and
then all of a sudden you ask just like
those super general questions and then
you get the the piyo answer from from a

[1:52:46]
you get the the piyo answer from from a
more or less random student without ever
looking at piyo because it's like yes
it's like you have it in you um
and yeah that's uh that's the main thing
yeah awesome so it sounds like a little
bit of an inbuilt talent to uh always be

[1:53:01]
bit of an inbuilt talent to uh always be
asking questions but it sounds like
you've fine-tuned that skill set
throughout your life from helping people
with maths now to coach and poker and
yeah i think it's a it's a really
powerful
life lesson for all of us to always stop
and go wait what questions can i be
asking here like i said you can get like

[1:53:15]
asking here like i said you can get like
jt or a pirate solution from somebody
who has never seen a solver if you probe
the right questions and yeah i think
it's good to uh look at our lives and go
what questions could be asking how can i
direct myself and my life better by
asking questions is there any questions
you ask yourself regularly i've got one

[1:53:31]
you ask yourself regularly i've got one
m a question i asked myself every week
every other week is what would this look
like if it was easy what would this look
like it was easy i'm generally trying to
solve my life problems or coordinate my
week and i always go over look i was
easy and that gives me a framing of okay
just do these things and i simplify so

[1:53:47]
just do these things and i simplify so
any questions you use regularly that's
that are helpful for you
not consciously like it's interesting to
think about but uh no i've nothing
consciously it's more like the
um
yeah more like the the outlook to the
future what will the future bring like

[1:54:01]
future what will the future bring like
especially like uh now with the the
um yeah things in in private life that
are going on that i'm thinking about um
and and yeah with the situation with
poker it's just like more that kind of
question but nothing like using
questions as a tool to really think

[1:54:15]
questions as a tool to really think
something through um couldn't think of
anything no but uh yeah cool cool we'll
think about it now yeah it sounds like
you're very adaptive with your questions
so you use them on the fly as they come
up so that's that's a good tool all
right running any quick fire questions
or any where you want to see the

[1:54:31]
or any where you want to see the
conversation with any future questions i
think he i think if stefan
because he knows himself and he's very
clear on where he wants to go and then
basically
the maybe unconscious next question is
okay then what do i have to do on a
daily basis okay i go do it
basically

[1:54:46]
basically
does that sound
about right
yeah i'm just i'm just thinking about
that little little challenge i'm having
right there so and then starting like uh
started second of january playing zoom
200 again and i think i run super bad so

[1:55:00]
200 again and i think i run super bad so
far but it it feels just not okay so i
and it's not it's not okay either to
just keep whining about the results even
though you get presents left and right
and then forget about about all the the
bad one and some kind of cooler so it's
really that i have that in mind like

[1:55:16]
really that i have that in mind like
what can i do i think i'm definitely
ahead of all them um but what can i do
to even maximize here that we're like
okay this is just like do i just grind
it out and wait for for better times in
a way or where do i put my effort into

[1:55:31]
a way or where do i put my effort into
just like again uh to just have that
little challenge for myself uh before
hopefully when the corona situation
allows it to to spend more time in
vienna next year or this year now um and
and yeah um play play uh uh rainy a

[1:55:46]
and yeah um play play uh uh rainy a
little on higher stakes as well right
looking looking forward to that yeah
we're we're in the same time zone
usually so uh that's gonna be fun uh
obviously you currently you spend a lot
of time on uh on poker code and on
coaching there i uh i went briefly nah

[1:56:02]
coaching there i uh i went briefly nah
actually like some briefing i think i
spent three four five hours watching uh
some of your content a lot of good stuff
in there for sure
um therefore so you mentioned you play a
lot of 200 zoom right now and you
clearly feel like you're beating those
games right what is it about uh

[1:56:17]
games right what is it about uh
your average i'm pretty positive
what is it what is it about
your average 201 zoom player
that makes them a 210 zoom player not a
higher sticks player what like what what
do they often do wrong do you have a
couple of

[1:56:30]
couple of
tips
we have different groups i just
restarted all my labeling uh because
they were like some old notes so i
sometimes like to start from scratch
especially when i have been off the
tables for a while and it's really

[1:56:45]
tables for a while and it's really
really interesting we have that
old
guys where i still know the name from
five years ago where like
i don't know what is wrong with them but
some something needs to like not making
the next step for five years and
grinding that out for one bb per 100 and

[1:57:02]
grinding that out for one bb per 100 and
winning like not too much rake back is
is i i can't see it maybe other peop
maybe they are living somewhere where
they make the best living out of that
and that's just like the easy job maybe
i don't know but for me it's like yeah
they will always play the same and and

[1:57:16]
they will always play the same and and
and are not really thinking things
through right and that is mainly that
big group of playing more or less value
only waiting for presents overfolding
all all small spots and then uh having
it when the pot gets big every single

[1:57:30]
it when the pot gets big every single
time right it's like the the typical
biggest mistake like not three betting
the big blind pretty much at all or
playing in jax plus ace king range there
that's a one very very large group you
have in the soup 200 pool
then you have a a group of

[1:57:45]
the
kind of um
solver based new fast learners right
people that that rised up in poker um in
the last
years or maybe it's just one or two
years because it's so easy to learn
poker these days it's like
poker code is helping every solver is

[1:58:01]
poker code is helping every solver is
helping poker ambition is helping
there's so much great you can you can
watch uh you play you can watch me play
there's so much good stuff out there
back then we were sitting there with pen
and paper and thinking things through
uh so this is just an acceleration for

[1:58:15]
uh so this is just an acceleration for
your level of the poker game and there
are some great players and they just
have the problem
of um like which games to play in a way
where do they get into back then we had
them 200 running 500 running with lots
of entries we had zoom 1k running we had
normal regular tables shout out to king

[1:58:31]
normal regular tables shout out to king
ten of clubs just like infinite of those
and right now it's about a lot of
selecting right i think you can very
very easily and fast get up to 200
um
but then what next to build your
bankroll so i think since lots of people

[1:58:46]
bankroll so i think since lots of people
can be already very good but are
somewhat bankroll capped so i i just
added some one of the good racks there
in in skype and just like yes he is
sometimes here adding this 1k table but
then it's a shot that hurts him already
right five times the stakes what is in

[1:59:00]
right five times the stakes what is in
between do you add i don't know i know
400 600 on like some sites it's just
way less action than i don't know seven
years ago um
this is the other group
and then you have um

[1:59:18]
the i don't know the south americans
take over the crazy guys right it's like
the i don't know like they want it too
much it's like it's i don't know whether
it's just
the nation read there but let's call
them the the ego group where people are

[1:59:31]
them the the ego group where people are
really overdoing it we're like i don't
know
whether i think people play differently
against me just because they know the
name um i've talked to some people and
they just
confirm that they don't get called by
ridiculous everything in those i call

[1:59:45]
ridiculous everything in those i call
them the black white situations where
like
you leverage a lot right and it's like
you either have it or not where i have i
just like
it feels bad but i always have to have
it i'm so sorry but it's like if in the
you you create a spot where villain is
forced to fold 80 percent

[2:00:01]
forced to fold 80 percent
if they take that as a 50 50 spot it's
like because it's like yeah heist player
he will have his bluff
just like calling is more fun than
folding so it's like um that's the big
problem i'm fighting right now because i

[2:00:15]
problem i'm fighting right now because i
can't help myself and sometimes need to
press that button um but but yeah that's
uh like something like that people are
who are really overdoing it and maybe
taking things
personal i don't know maybe big egos
involved

[2:00:30]
involved
and you have that so it's really that
that knitty group where you just like
keep hammering on as long as they are
not interested and just fold when they
show interest you have that ego group
that you just need to play
i don't i never try to outsmart them
because i i cannot look into their brain

[2:00:45]
because i i cannot look into their brain
that's too crazy for me i cannot i try
to stick like somewhat close to piyo and
actually call bluff catchers more often
than i should so it's like that until i
gain more knowledge maybe um that group
and uh what was the third uh i forgot

[2:01:00]
and uh what was the third uh i forgot
already but it's like really uh i like
the gto guys yeah the difference that
are more than just good
selection and then not talking about the
these are all wrecks right so obviously
we have the typical zoom fish like we
have those
12 four guys clicking through until they

[2:01:15]
12 four guys clicking through until they
have kings plus
then min three betting and stack off any
board right i mean this is the the the
daily daily business and you still have
like those 40-0
guys about this is just every i try to
group group the racks in a way to have

[2:01:31]
group group the racks in a way to have
an idea because i won't collect the
sample or do the review for single racks
so i need to group them and for the
recreationals or really bad players
there it's just worth to look at them as
really individuals where like i tackle i

[2:01:46]
really individuals where like i tackle i
try to really
focus my notes especially on those uh
timing tell sizing tells whatever like
because this is where the money comes
from and they're every every year
i don't want to use the word but every
whale is an individual one and um yeah

[2:02:00]
whale is an individual one and um yeah
it's it's just um what i try to focus on
and then i think yeah they are really
it's that it's so interesting to look at
it it's like they are some people where
zoom 200 is definitely the end of their
career i mean who played that for five
years won't make the next step anytime

[2:02:16]
years won't make the next step anytime
soon and for others i think it's so
you're in a different mindset you're
you're in a mindset of going downwards
it's you have to then change something
radically yeah else and then and then
the others were just like on the edge of
like
probably adding higher stakes etc

[2:02:32]
probably adding higher stakes etc
and um yeah
i also find it it's probably also very
difficult if you're so used to just
firing up your two newton's zoom like i
said it's in again it's an environment
where you can control everything the
pool is always running so you play when
you feel best you plan your brakes but

[2:02:45]
you feel best you plan your brakes but
then when you have to make that switch
to like adding sites normal tables
tables breaking a very big part of your
attention is gonna go to finding games
closing games not getting grimmed
opening other sites so it's actually you

[2:03:00]
opening other sites so it's actually you
will have a lot of trouble coming from
zoom and i think a lot of players they
they try it for a little bit but then
they immediately go back to zoom because
it's just so much more comfortable they
don't
you have to go through the paint a
little bit because in the end yeah
higher than 500 zoom doesn't really
exist so if you want to make it to the

[2:03:15]
exist so if you want to make it to the
highest state zoom is like probably one
of the toughest limits out there it's
like still you are still playing
sometimes i mean you have your
recreations there as well but you have
like high stakes racks showing up there
every day
yeah because it's just like oh there's
nothing oh let's see if uh okay i'll add

[2:03:30]
nothing oh let's see if uh okay i'll add
uh i'll out of five and i'll zoom it's
like the the praxis it's like the lap in
a way just like when you wanna fight
it's like the battle arena it's like
this is always more or less always
running at least
yeah it's uh if if if you're interested
in making the most money now 500 zoom is

[2:03:46]
in making the most money now 500 zoom is
uh probably not the place to go right
yeah uh
going to um
[Music]
going to your your your poca code
product um i wanna
ask you something that you mentioned

[2:04:01]
ask you something that you mentioned
because you were talking about how you
know many strategies can be gto right i
remember you showed okay this is a
mimbad only this is a mix this is an
over bat evs are all similar i mean it's
a solver great i explained that myself
as well a solver regardless of what

[2:04:16]
as well a solver regardless of what
options you will give him he will play
these options perfectly so deviations in
ev will always be minimum right it's
just it's as simple as that and then you
mentioned that
you like to sometimes choose an
alternative approach

[2:04:31]
alternative approach
or that there's benefits in choosing an
alternative approach than what the rest
of the people are doing
could you maybe give an example of that
of how you might use a not the most gto
uh uh strategy but a strategy that you

[2:04:45]
uh uh strategy but a strategy that you
think helps you well because it puts
your opponents maybe in a difficult spot
or you understand that spot better
so it's it's um
it's really that understanding of what
the eb means lots of people take that as
a given thing right the eb that the

[2:05:00]
a given thing right the eb that the
solver shows you is your ev taking that
line playing against someone else who
plays the solver optimal line under
those circumstances which
is the most wrong thing in the world
right we are playing against people who

[2:05:15]
right we are playing against people who
are [ __ ] things up every day you see
that with yourself right i see that with
myself and probably our average
opponents
maybe they don't see it but we see that
they do that even more so um
it's really that what we need to keep in

[2:05:30]
it's really that what we need to keep in
mind and that is something not that i i
mean making something different than the
pool to just say like okay i do
something differently let's say some
like everyone opens 2.5 x if i
can do something else with uh without
losing solver ev in a way i'm i'm one

[2:05:48]
losing solver ev in a way i'm i'm one
out of hundred who does that so i will
do it better than the others because i
studied that every day they see it one
out of 100 times right might be as easy
as like min raising the button instead
of 2.5 x or 3 axing the button instead

[2:06:00]
of 2.5 x or 3 axing the button instead
of 2.5 axing might be an idea we can go
into lots of detailed spots there
obviously but what is even more
important than just like deviating from
what everyone does is really giving
those challenges to people that are
tough to

[2:06:15]
tough to
to fight against right the solver will
find the perfect reaction
um but let's face it right big bats make
it easy for example but big bats allows
villain to play
let's say we part bad he is more or less
allowed to fold fifty percent which well

[2:06:31]
allowed to fold fifty percent which well
the first forty percent will be easy
folds because it's just like you have
nothing right i just have like ace king
four in mind well like you bet huge the
solver suggests a huge bet for certain
reasons that's super cool but you force
villain to play perfectly with all his

[2:06:46]
villain to play perfectly with all his
eight nine offsuits right instead of
checking back and letting letting him
play and find the right lines right
amount of bluffing right whatever
with his full full full [ __ ] that's all
there is yes the solver will answer
perfectly against any sizing but maybe

[2:07:01]
perfectly against any sizing but maybe
like other things are more interesting
sometimes right for example three bet
pots out of position let's take a board
like
10 5 deuce rainbow right if we say big
blind versus button that's a board where
mainly just the big size exists in

[2:07:15]
mainly just the big size exists in
theory or the solver suggests that
but yeah because the small size every
hand that in position has plus given his
positional advantage
is just a call against like a quarter
part or so we will see spots where they
are allowed to fold like three percent

[2:07:31]
are allowed to fold like three percent
where what is happening in reality what
is tougher for maybe not the greatest
players in the world
well defending correctly against small
sizes where they need to call 100 of
their range or have some raising range
as well to continue with their weakest

[2:07:45]
as well to continue with their weakest
[ __ ]
might be more interesting you can force
them to split their range pretty early
in a way right by just like
having certain knowledge right against
some players i like to keep the betting
lead a little more
because i know what their reaction is
that's the more

[2:08:01]
that's the more
natural thing but just i bet small you
call when you have something you race
when you have something very good you
fold when you have nothing that's what i
can
i can look into the future but if i
check to you on a certain board
i have no clue how you build your
betting ranges but if i know that

[2:08:16]
betting ranges but if i know that
or i gain knowledge through what you do
there this might be way better right i
have for example if you look at a solver
again let's take that three bad part out
of out of position
you will see on something like
eight five three you will see lots of

[2:08:31]
eight five three you will see lots of
big betting and lots of checking
and on the checking you will follow up
with lots of check raising right because
your position you have the position of
disadvantage you have the advantage
right now you want to get the money in
the middle now before there are more

[2:08:45]
the middle now before there are more
cards in position that villain can make
use of like using his positional
advantage and just knowing more about
that word then
where against some players
it's like i want to see those two lines
as the same thing pretty much big bad or
check race we both have the goal to get

[2:09:00]
check race we both have the goal to get
the maximum money in the middle right
now instead of waiting for later and uh
well sometimes i'm playing check only
against people who overstep there or who
give me information about their hand
strength with their stabbing strategy
against some people who are very passive
i just bet all the time because this is

[2:09:16]
i just bet all the time because this is
how i achieve getting the most of the
money and this is just i want to more
understand incentives and see it as
something
i'm the one i split it up i'm sure you
you you listen to that into like action
game and reaction game and whenever i'm

[2:09:30]
game and reaction game and whenever i'm
an action game
i'm the one setting the parameters and
i'm not playing the solvers i set the
parameters in a way or i try that which
gives villain a puzzle that is tough
right if it is obviously a puzzle that
he has seen 10 times already before

[2:09:45]
he has seen 10 times already before
because this is the solver he runs all
day
he will solve it he will do it in a good
way if i give him puzzle he hasn't seen
but is an easy puzzle for example he is
allowed to fold 70 of his range let's
say i just over bet jam on that 852
sport
might be a puzzle but it's easy to solve

[2:10:01]
might be a puzzle but it's easy to solve
or i find a puzzle that is maybe
maybe a little tougher
while the other part the reaction game
is just finding out a lot right it's
like i made this morning already the
note um
that's big face up hands in position on

[2:10:16]
that's big face up hands in position on
boards where big bad does not
necessarily exist right it's that type
of player i know i guess you know them
it's like that he has king queen on king
six four he bets big just because he has
king queen this guy has
bottom two pair on kind of a similar

[2:10:31]
bottom two pair on kind of a similar
board he bets big now because it's like
yeah i get the money in now we're like
okay you need again to see the bigger
picture and
understand that what does it mean well
his small betting range is [ __ ] up
right you just overfold everything and
when he bet small you just really kill

[2:10:46]
when he bet small you just really kill
him right and go go a little crazy where
again i like spotting those game trees
where people are just worse in and
didn't study i think everyone is quite
okay in let's say the
seabed than having a double barrel
strategy but people are really really

[2:11:01]
strategy but people are really really
bad in sizings in the late game tree i
myself am too right it's it's it's kind
of the wild west of the mid stakes right
it's like everyone is like over betting
small betting it's like betting their
hand strength this some people are crazy
over bluffing some people are never

[2:11:15]
over bluffing some people are never
bluffing it so it's really the wild west
um
and and and just stuff like that and
this is where
i don't care about the stakes but the
game is making me fun it's really that
figuring that out making those notes
evolving as a player having kind of new

[2:11:31]
evolving as a player having kind of new
strategies uh for now right now i'm
working for example one of my topics
right now is the
um
delayed min betting on like high
cardboards it's like i guess i mean you
did i'm sure you did lots of stuff like

[2:11:45]
did i'm sure you did lots of stuff like
that like or monotone board i've tried
everything goose i've tried everything
ace jack four sometimes goes check check
turn is a king let's put the freaking
min bet out there and [ __ ] them up and
let's see right we're like force them to
defend their pocket sixes but they won't
um right just like those ideas were like

[2:12:02]
um right just like those ideas were like
i talk in those terms already like i
force him in theory to do something to
answer the puzzle i give him with a
certain strategy but it's easy to pretty
much have those thoughts that like where
will they do mistakes right if i yeah

[2:12:16]
will they do mistakes right if i yeah
it's again like for example let's make
one more example blind versus blind all
right um
what is the board we get a queen five
deuce rainbow board we see that small
turn is a 10 right if you look at the
solver you see lots of now

[2:12:31]
solver you see lots of now
180 percent 2e sizing right the sizing
that is linearly going directional in
because you have the straight advantages
around that villain is not really not
protected not having tense queen 10 is
the strongest hand probably now um so

[2:12:45]
the strongest hand probably now um so
something like that where
is that the best line though against
humans what is it like it's like against
the solver it's just slightly slightly
better than maybe another big bad but
against humans it allows them to pretty
much just fold everything right we're
like hey people can't hold that yes it's

[2:13:00]
like hey people can't hold that yes it's
perfect against people who can't fold
but
if you if your line means that you force
villain to play perfectly
is it the best line possible that's all
it's really that it's when we talk on
that level it's not
it's like pretty much the baseline that

[2:13:16]
it's like pretty much the baseline that
we understand how the whole game works
right that like it's easy to to
understand
which hands are correct to bluff what
are the value bets etc and then it's
actually going to like one more level to
really say okay maybe giving up solver

[2:13:30]
really say okay maybe giving up solver
eb in a way maybe play a fancy puzzle
here do something else here to really
put the like
forced villains to to make mistakes or
give them the potential to make mistakes
um and that can be just like different

[2:13:45]
um and that can be just like different
types of game trees that we built or
just deviating a lot by maybe even
giving up bb on like
yeah min raising the button can be a
thing
not not for german extra rake though
yeah so yeah indeed you you prefer brief

[2:14:00]
yeah so yeah indeed you you prefer brief
up folds right that has more more a
little more three bet heavy than others
and i started uh 2.5 axing even from
under the gun yeah
yeah no i mean it makes a lot of sense
right if you understand the rake impact
has on on the game then and you pay more

[2:14:16]
has on on the game then and you pay more
rake then that's the logical consequence
if you come now to zoom 200 and you limp
your small blind i will personally drive
to rotterdam and slap you in your face
like it's just not okay okay can i still
do it if i have no zoom

[2:14:30]
do it if i have no zoom
uh i can't play 500 zoom so you can do
whatever you want there no but okay but
i'm allowed to lean to small but there's
500 zoom right that's okay yeah
that's okay and even then i remember
especially with the
the the whole rake story about limping i

[2:14:45]
the the whole rake story about limping i
heard a lot the whole story about dunk
bedding and these were two things that i
was just constantly doing everywhere dog
bedding limping and there were always so
much stories about it yeah but i find
okay let's let's open up the topic about
small bat limping and then the other
person immediately closes the top

[2:15:00]
person immediately closes the top
because says rake's too high discussion
closed
it's like okay but come on maybe
if both players play perfectly then yes
stars exactly because like okay so
basically no one in the pool limps okay
okay interesting so if i limp they have

[2:15:15]
okay interesting so if i limp they have
no [ __ ] clue what to do and then you
look at all the leaks that are available
in limb pots it's like okay [ __ ] the
rake i'm going for it you know yeah it's
like sometimes people people just close
off a certain door too fast right the
same with the dunking uh with the flop

[2:15:31]
same with the dunking uh with the flop
dunking you know especially i mean
f five years ago
i was dunking
you know more than the whole pool
combined basically and people were
saying yeah but i run a dunk in the
solver and it doesn't really generate
much more ev and like yeah okay

[2:15:47]
much more ev and like yeah okay
indeed like what i felt like you wait
you wouldn't probably dunk against the
solver
exactly right if i put that donk out
there wow he has a tough spot because he
has to do this i think people are gonna
overrate oh if he overrates oh if i come

[2:16:00]
overrate oh if he overrates oh if i come
over the top again oh wow he's in a
really shitty spot
so instead of looking at
that's kind of all i got from your story
and looking instead of looking at okay
what does the solver prefer let's do
that you're like what does the solver
prefer
why doesn't he prefer the other options
and can i maybe use one of these options

[2:16:16]
and can i maybe use one of these options
to put my opponent in a tough spot yes
right because for example on the 10-5
deuce what you said if you if you bet
small
yeah if you play a strategy where then
imposition decides if he wants to build
a bigger pot and can just realize all
his equity

[2:16:31]
his equity
assuming that yeah we're playing as a
solver he's going to play later streets
perfectly that's not a gto strategy in
gto but yeah if you if you bet small
the guy's going to float you with any
two and over bluff 50 percent and you
then don't fault on later streets hey

[2:16:45]
then don't fault on later streets hey
fine strategy right
yeah it's i mean it's it's really insane
how like really seeing in that level and
not being one of those i try to copy
what the solver does given certain
parameters um
just like it's it's a new fun level of
the whole game actually like i like so

[2:17:01]
the whole game actually like i like so
much just like running some sims and
then uh maybe like just changing some
parameters like for example okay i know
people are not check raising enough in
certain spots okay how does it look like
if i don't allow them to check race at
all let's have a look right what does it

[2:17:15]
all let's have a look right what does it
change if i see that in the three bad
part and
i know they are not raising at all
let's just double check on that how does
the
solver ev then change what incentives
are given next uh and so on and so on
that's like i'm i'm actually like uh my
biggest

[2:17:30]
biggest
uh favorite move right now is the ten
percent river donkey donkey that's a
the uh a really really nice class for
goose here yeah yeah big fan big fan
yeah
when i hear 10
and and even river dunk in the same line

[2:17:45]
and and even river dunk in the same line
i mean you're making my day here
you're making my day
no yeah but it's it's
i think a lot of
players get it wrong they they think
they have to play like the solver but
that's not the point you have to figure

[2:18:00]
that's not the point you have to figure
out how does the solver generate ev in
his in a certain line that he does what
can i learn from that take that
knowledge to the table
we both like to ask the question where
does rev come from i remember when i
went before i launched my course i
shared to uh i shared you my uh

[2:18:17]
shared to uh i shared you my uh
the things that i was gonna talk about
do you remember that you're like yes
it's exactly is you talk about exactly
the same things as me and even though we
never talked any poker strategy together
right where does my ev come from for
example is a very big question in in my
philosophy and definitely a very big

[2:18:31]
philosophy and definitely a very big
question in yours as well from what i've
seen because if you know
where the ev comes from in a strategy of
the solver and as you just said in 2010
l on the zumpu there's people who
deviate a lot 80 probably
then what the solver actually does is

[2:18:46]
then what the solver actually does is
useless
but
why it does something and how it
generates a v and then applying that
with the question where does my value
have to come from versus this player
now that's some valuable information
then we can make some high av plays it
was really like such a fun talk like we

[2:19:00]
was really like such a fun talk like we
i mean we know each other from the
tables but actually we never battled too
much i guess and it's really that like
just meeting and like maybe seeing like
some some some things just like having
so very very similar ideas and then
actually we agreed like a a great thing

[2:19:15]
actually we agreed like a a great thing
to share as well that it's like okay uh
i'm the the cash game head coach or
poker code you are you are doing the
coaching for poker ambition but i i
don't see like the two of us as like
competitors at all for example we're
like yes we are more focusing a little

[2:19:30]
like yes we are more focusing a little
on like yes everyone who is interested
in having more fun in poker and this is
really for for everyone and i guess you
are more on the the university level
right maybe
you have those two right some some
football analogies or fifa card games
but that's really like for for the for

[2:19:45]
but that's really like for for the for
the
mid stakes players who really want to
get to the top were like right uh i'm
i'm happy to help everyone who is that
but like pretty much like me in early
career just like who is happy with the
local league and wants to beat a beat up
his play at the players in in the home

[2:20:00]
his play at the players in in the home
game because actually
it's not like
they can cannot learn from each other
it's like so fun to see where like i i i
talk about ancestry's from like a random
vegas life game and it's like still the
same analogies work right it's like okay
them teaching them the look-alike and

[2:20:16]
them teaching them the look-alike and
the dice principle is just like they
like oh blew my mind right it's like
really crazy and this is how i see it
we're like all right first thing i i
probably recommend everyone who is like
hey i want to dig even deeper
and i'm like part of poker code but

[2:20:31]
and i'm like part of poker code but
there's mainly just you as a cash game
coach i sent them over to you right if
they are like in the right position as
like if someone looks at like wow poker
ambition yes great some seminars but the
whole course is like
maybe too expensive for like what what

[2:20:45]
maybe too expensive for like what what
i'm aiming at and then maybe something
else is is is the perfect perfect option
where like i love it so much and i'm the
the biggest probably instagram follower
on youtube just watching all those
little videos because i just think like
the way we think pretty alike there uh i

[2:21:00]
the way we think pretty alike there uh i
i just like everything that is that is
thrown out there uh and yeah i mean if
you have seen me watching the the the
the twitch twitch show uh every now and
then definitely as well um yeah i
remember already since the beginning you
were a little loyal follower on

[2:21:15]
were a little loyal follower on
instagram when we just started out with
the cfp and rotted them
no no i i i appreciate that and i
appreciate that
um
actually also i i remember i got a
message that you were giving a shout out
you said in one of your lectures yeah go

[2:21:30]
you said in one of your lectures yeah go
go check out jaredman on youtube go
check out the weco on the weka show on
twitter you know these guys
you know they like to play around you
can learn something from them
what is the correct like there's so much
great free content out there but there's
so much [ __ ] free content out there as

[2:21:46]
so much [ __ ] free content out there as
well so it's like you gotta you gotta
help them out a little uh and and and
pre-select a little the the good stuff
right this is just where we where we
need to team up a little there and
that's just like i mean it's it's
so great actually i just i just found
out like carrot corner they're doing a

[2:22:01]
out like carrot corner they're doing a
fun fun job there as well like even they
are more more solver based and maybe not
not maybe a little less creative i will
talk to them soon and find that out but
uh yeah definitely like there's good
stuff out there when when you're in

[2:22:15]
stuff out there when when you're in
in the twitch streets and and like poker
so that's that's pretty cool
yeah i remember actually someone sent me
a message yesterday talking about that
like
they thought it was humbling to see that
i would also recommend other other
programs for example for example we're

[2:22:30]
programs for example for example we're
having you on right shout out to poker
code right but like because i don't see
it necessarily as
competitors you know and also for
example you can have a poker code
subscription and also get my program why
not you know i'm sure a lot of people
who are who have a poke code description

[2:22:45]
who are who have a poke code description
also have a run at one subscription
right i mean one everyone has a run at
one subscription i have a run across the
screen shout out to ronald was as well
shout out to everyone uh you know
because i think everyone
you know there's good content out there
right i think for coaching there's just

[2:23:01]
right i think for coaching there's just
a lot of good content out there what we
said we have a lot to do like really
that like we are in times where it's
just like so easy to learn fast with all
that help like whatever we had to learn
like throughout the years in the
beginning this is just you can learn in

[2:23:15]
beginning this is just you can learn in
a couple of months maybe right you won't
learn the experience we might have in
certain things but just like the pure
knowledge about the game and like how it
works is is just pretty easy and this is
this is just i mean we should see it as
a beautiful thing right because it's a
it's a very fun game and like the more

[2:23:31]
it's a very fun game and like the more
detailed it gets the more fun it can get
at the same time it's not that like a
big dark thing and no one knows what's
what's working and like that's actually
my favorite words like can you tell us
what is working and what is not working
that's like something like okay great
write a book about it and publish it in

[2:23:46]
write a book about it and publish it in
two years probably and it's all wrong
that you write down there but it's like
uh yeah i i just i just love to see all
that
yeah that's something i
i like about more
sort of principle typo coaching like you

[2:24:00]
sort of principle typo coaching like you
do as well for example if you look at
our main program the mechanics and if
you look at my technical
uh overview i don't talk about how to
play trivia parts out of position for
example
everything i talk about and everything
that i put in mechanics i try to make as

[2:24:15]
that i put in mechanics i try to make as
timeless as possible so these are just
principles that will never change no
matter how the game changes and they
apply to both tournaments and cash i
want to make it as broad as possible
right and timeless as possible because
indeed a lot of courses
two years from now ah yeah it doesn't

[2:24:30]
two years from now ah yeah it doesn't
apply anymore you know if you go too
specific on okay this really works right
now and then when you're indeed when
you're finally done writing the book you
have to start in the beginning again
because what you said in the beginning
maybe doesn't apply anymore yeah and in
the end it never comes out so that
doesn't really work

[2:24:45]
doesn't really work
um
going uh looking forward
you mentioned about uh obviously there
are some restrictions now in germany
that uh that allow you to i don't think
play higher than 200 and i'll zoom right
it's also again interesting to see that
you find you again went inwards for a

[2:25:01]
you find you again went inwards for a
challenge right you're challenging
yourself instead of having competition
at the tables trigger your
competitiveness so that's i think
interesting to see as well but you
mentioned
uh maybe going to
to vienna again maybe certain trips what

[2:25:17]
to vienna again maybe certain trips what
is your uh what are your poker goals
going forward
um i mean right now i will i will do
lots of stuff for poker code so i'm i'm
in touch a lot in touch with you know
how it is like when you when you prepare
videos and theory and stuff so it's
really like uh you you are still in

[2:25:32]
really like uh you you are still in
touch with the theory but it's like
different when you are sitting at the
table again right you see weird stuff
it's now how i just described okay now i
know again who my guys are there just
after after a week pretty much um so uh
i i plan on on going to vienna more

[2:25:46]
i i plan on on going to vienna more
often uh again i planned it last year
already the last two trips i had both to
cancel both of them um
just because of corona so i hope that
that gets better that it just can can go
there sometimes meet friends and and
grind like one week of real poker um and

[2:26:01]
grind like one week of real poker um and
that that would be good it's like still
still open whether maybe at some point
in the future i will live in vienna
again uh we'll gotta discuss that
together uh with my with my wife but we
are like we're it's like yeah is an
option uh so i definitely want to still

[2:26:17]
option uh so i definitely want to still
stay fresh in the game it's not like
like poker is 100 over for me maybe i i
start battling a little more again and i
still i think i'm
i i can make it there pretty quickly to
to like have a decent win rate in like

[2:26:30]
to like have a decent win rate in like
uh in like solid games as well
and uh yeah that's that's the plan from
now on let's pretty much seeing what the
what the year brings um how much
traveling is is okay or not and um
yeah that's that's the main plan um

[2:26:45]
yeah that's that's the main plan um
mainly second two cash games no more
entities yeah that's just um i mean as
long as i pay taxes in germany amputees
is just not a thing mtt's is maybe just
like going on a fun trip
uh but
the entities i played before just do not
make sense when

[2:27:01]
make sense when
it's like when you pretty much only can
use your own money so it's like when
staking or buying shares or even
swapping is just not possible because of
the
like how things are taxed in germany and
i don't want to do anything wrong um
and so it's like yeah you can find me

[2:27:16]
and so it's like yeah you can find me
maybe in barcelona playing the main
event something like that right but i
won't fly to vegas and play like 25ks
every day um
so uh i might i would
love to just like again
take take some people like i don't know

[2:27:30]
take take some people like i don't know
fly to mexico or thailand and grind
scoop for two weeks or something like
that to just have that whole feeling
again and then i i mean maybe i'm i
didn't do too much short stack i think i
should still be fine uh but maybe i
select some events there and play a nice

[2:27:45]
select some events there and play a nice
schedule that then fits to to my skills
that i'm i'm sure of are there um yeah
no no clear plans uh there yet but i can
see everything
so if you
it looks like possibly also a good

[2:28:00]
it looks like possibly also a good
combination right going all in and poker
for a couple weeks in vienna coming back
to your hometown in germany to relax
maybe you can find a nice balance in
there if you're gonna go back to the
to the high sex cash game grind what do
you think is uh
one of your greatest challenges

[2:28:15]
one of your greatest challenges
that you will have to overcome what is
like maybe some of the weaknesses that
you still have to improve on to
[Music]
it's like not that they are beat them
the clear big ones it's more the every
spot maybe
going a little deeper again it's like uh

[2:28:31]
going a little deeper again it's like uh
after now since june not working on like
we're reviewing gameplay uh in-depth for
what is it now six seven months uh six
months yeah
obviously it's like if you lose things a

[2:28:45]
obviously it's like if you lose things a
little but i think since most of the
high stakes table are running about a
kind of a bigger spot anyways it will be
fine so it's like and um
seeing which regulars are playing there
it's like

[2:29:00]
it's like
not that it makes my my like makes me
shaking it's like i'm not really scared
of that competition there too much and
i'm i'm like i'm a lot in touch with uh
with duty um who like had another
um two great years behind him uh like

[2:29:16]
um two great years behind him uh like
crushing exactly those stakes um sharing
lots of thoughts and and stuff like that
so i think it's when you are not forced
to just really think things through all
on yourself it's just always an
accelerator of uh just like getting back

[2:29:30]
accelerator of uh just like getting back
into the into the game
all right then i have my final question
for you then i'll give it over to adam
and then we're gonna wrap it off
um
if you could pick three people
okay
to help you get

[2:29:45]
to help you get
to a higher
level in your poker career guys girls
and you had to go
you go in a house together like you
mentioned maybe in mexico for a couple
months and you're really gonna go all in
to try to become the best of the best
who are three people that you would

[2:30:01]
who are three people that you would
include in your house you can pick
anyone
dead or alive
hmm
this is too ugly i don't know
ah i didn't expect that so
best of the best uh so i

[2:30:19]
think about you you know you need now
you need you need three different maybe
three different angles you know
yes but it's it needs to be if it's
really in the house in mexico i need

[2:30:30]
really in the house in mexico i need
three people i get along with as well
and you know that's important that's
very important so i think there are some
people i would love to have a look into
their brain
but not more so they are out pretty much
um who would who didn't make it because

[2:30:45]
um who would who didn't make it because
of that now i'm curious who are you
curious to look into that i don't know
whether i can call out names here uh but
i mean for example i would be very
curious to look in the poker brain of
stefan
one one two two two

[2:31:02]
one one two two two
yeah actually he might be an option i
didn't think of him so far i just don't
know know him uh like how he is
privately but i think he's just like he
seems to be a cool relaxed guy all right
i take stefan with me let's freaking go
i take stefan with me all right um

[2:31:17]
i take stefan with me all right um
uri pelic with me
all right shout out to republic
and
we got a nice team going on here

[2:31:31]
we got a nice team going on here
maybe someone who makes a decent cook at
the same time
uh from what i was told in our first
podcast yours uh is quite what used to
be a chef has some entity inputs
yeah he won't make it no no no hmm

[2:31:48]
yeah he won't make it no no no hmm
that's tough that's tough uh so we got
it's about getting licenses
like i don't need a scripter right in my
house so um

[2:32:01]
i mean whatever you think is is no i i
take i take 2d with me as well i think
i'm fine with it just chatting with him
as well but it will be like a super
relaxed situation then he's pretty close
with uri i guess and i like their their
way of of like looking at strategy even

[2:32:16]
way of of like looking at strategy even
though i was never really involved
myself and then then stefan has like the
the special other kind of like other
his brain is definitely working in a
different way he's the special one he is
the definitely the special one yes and i

[2:32:30]
the definitely the special one yes and i
think i've just seen pictures and talked
a little or like have seen like or it
was duty talking to him and he was he
was chilling for like he's not locked in
like in like a russian building
somewhere wasn't he like chilling in
costa rica with lucky cps and others and
stuff like that so i think he's that

[2:32:47]
stuff like that so i think he's that
gives me enough proof for for like uh
him him being cool to hang out with
yeah you need to be able to drink some
coronas at the beach with him afterwards
yeah it's like i mean i always have that
image of okay if it's just someone who
locks himself in the room runs the

[2:33:00]
locks himself in the room runs the
solvers all night and has never seen
sunlight um that's like not the person i
want to hang out with there even though
his poker strategy might be great um so
i but i think uh stefan is not like that
at all so um yeah let's let's take him
in the team

[2:33:15]
in the team
that's uh that's a fearless that's
that's a very good team you've
established your i mean everyone has to
ask that question right
i i'm the one asking the questions here
but yeah i would i would probably
include stefan as well i would include
the linus as well because i've never

[2:33:31]
the linus as well because i've never
talked any form of strategy with linus
on
he talks very very very slowly that's
the problem
it's like that i don't know i mean it's
true for all swiss people but they talk
very slowly
to be fair poker code content i also

[2:33:46]
to be fair poker code content i also
watch on 1.5 speed you're
adam adam when i watch adam's content i
have to reduce the speed when i watch
your content i have to increase the
speed
that's okay
so yeah linus stefan
who else would i include

[2:34:02]
who else would i include
you didn't see any of the four tabling
live videos then
no i didn't yeah
i didn't
and my third one maybe maybe i'll uh
i'll add like um

[2:34:17]
i'll add like um
not really a poker player but maybe like
a like a jarrod tender type of person
okay or maybe or maybe actually i'll
bring adam
mindset performance
can you cook adam i can
basic

[2:34:30]
basic
i'll i'll take adam along with me so i
have all the poker noise that i need
with stefan and linus you know that's a
good cure
that's enough and then i'll add some
other dynamics in adam
over the chef
at least my house is winning the

[2:34:46]
at least my house is winning the
drinking war so i'd say i'm well
prepared true i don't i don't think me
and adam were gonna do a lot of drinking
there even though i heard lioness uh
lightest can drink right
i wouldn't and i mean stefan russian so
yeah and we got stefan and i and uh yeah

[2:35:01]
yeah and we got stefan and i and uh yeah
duty is from a special area from germany
yeah i was gonna say germans and
russians they love drinking all right
adam do you have any final questions for
uh
for stefan here
i've got a bunch of questions but i
think they'll take us off on random

[2:35:16]
think they'll take us off on random
tangents so i think we'll i'll be
respectful of stefan's time here and
yeah i just want to thank you for an
amazing podcast i've learned a lot of
lessons from your wisdom and i feel like
you've lived a very full poker
experience in a short amount of time

[2:35:30]
experience in a short amount of time
relatively probably seems like a long
time to you and we have some really
really powerful lessons on
self-awareness seeing the bigger picture
and perspective and reframing so yeah
really really powerful stuff i feel like
every every question you've answered
i've been take a note in i'll reflect on
your answer so yeah thank you for your

[2:35:45]
your answer so yeah thank you for your
time and yeah i'll leave it to running
to do the final final closing
all right what's up do you have any
final words i mean stefan just saying i
was there was lots of fun lots of lots
of things actually like to talk about
and to to think about for me now in the
in the near future as well so i'm

[2:36:01]
in the near future as well so i'm
definitely thinking about the questions
i can ask myself uh on a more regular
basis something i think is is just cool
because uh just like watching how things
can change probably is the most
interesting thing uh like maybe one last
story that i enjoyed just so much was uh

[2:36:15]
story that i enjoyed just so much was uh
finding i was like uh blogging a little
in the german forums uh like 2
14 or 13 to 16 and just watching that
five years later can be kind of a
similar thing just like
reading myself talking about yeah

[2:36:31]
reading myself talking about yeah
probably finishing like not seeing
myself in the poker area
in two three years from now was
something something fun to find in like
a post from 2015 or like when they just
announced that sne uh got got killed but

[2:36:46]
announced that sne uh got got killed but
stuff like that i i just love love that
way of thinking and uh yeah it's a
really really nice talk to you guys
what a great conversation that was with
stefan aka goose course sondheimer

[2:37:00]
stefan aka goose course sondheimer
a lot i mean guys there's just so much
me and adam we were talking about it
like there's so much questions that we
might still have but hey
at some point we have to call it an end
just a little summary for you guys adam
what were your main takeaways i know it
was hard to take away only a couple

[2:37:16]
was hard to take away only a couple
things but what really stuck with you
out of this conversation yeah so many
things came up i wrote about 12
important things but i just mentioned a
couple of them which i think were the
most powerful for me
one was his self-awareness to always

[2:37:30]
one was his self-awareness to always
have this clear value system and for him
that's basically his ability to navigate
his landscape and know what's important
and what's not this often led him to
make kind of safe choices because that
was in line with his values it often
turned down what would be classed as big
opportunities to make more money by

[2:37:45]
opportunities to make more money by
buying action in high rollers or even by
playing higher stakes himself at certain
points of his career so by having a
clear value system things that would be
a conflict for most players should i do
this should i do that he navigated them
very easily and also i was amazed by how
little problems he has which gets me

[2:38:01]
little problems he has which gets me
onto his next skill which i thought was
very powerful is his ability to uh use
perspective and reframing so when
obstacles come his way he's already
treated like an opportunity to learn
from how can i learn from this
opportunity so we almost couldn't pin
him onto an obstacle because he would

[2:38:15]
him onto an obstacle because he would
never call an obstacle because there's a
land opportunity i think when at one
point you said um
he said some guys having a year of polka
and if it failed you'd be like wouldn't
be a failure excited to learn something
even like uh if we could class as a
failure from the outside he instantly
thought about how can i how can i

[2:38:31]
thought about how can i how can i
reframe this so yeah the perspective
skills and his self-awareness and
alignment with his values it was very
very interesting to hear and also like
which we didn't really cover throughout
but just how humbly is and just willing
to learn like obvious obviously he's
played some of the highest games in the
world the one drop the super high

[2:38:46]
world the one drop the super high
rollers yet he's willing just to grind
it out at the 200 zoom pool because
that's the game that's available with no
ego no
no like uh just social humble ones to
learn so so many things around that
which are really powerful but yeah a
million lessons that i could expand
another hour but i'll i'll leave it at

[2:39:01]
another hour but i'll i'll leave it at
that um anything from you renee which
was which really stuck out
yeah i remember i labeled him at some
point as a
like he was very very he he lived very
mindful lived very stoic i think a lot

[2:39:15]
mindful lived very stoic i think a lot
of things were necessarily unconscious
like all the things that i learned about
mindfulness and stoicism i mainly
learned from actively learning from
books or from looking up other people
and i think a lot of the things how he
thinks about life came quite natural
right like that he didn't necessarily

[2:39:31]
right like that he didn't necessarily
need to achieve certain things to feel a
certain way because he already had
everything that he wanted right there
like success was already inside of him
basically he didn't need to go out and
you know
get 20 million uh to feel successful for

[2:39:45]
get 20 million uh to feel successful for
example so i thought that was uh that
was really strong also the power of the
questions especially
at the technical side of the game right
nowadays we talked about how much access
we have to information basically all the
information is out there so what becomes

[2:40:00]
information is out there so what becomes
very important is that you understand
the information correctly and mainly the
why behind it and then ask yourself good
questions poker nowadays i think is more
about
picking and prioritizing what is really
important and thinking about only that

[2:40:15]
important and thinking about only that
instead of learning new knowledge what i
think most people try to do is get our
new knowledge and then they end up with
having a lot of knowledge which they
don't necessarily master and then while
they are making poker decisions a lot of
stuff can come in their mind and then
they end up kind of choking because
there's just too much information

[2:40:31]
there's just too much information
right and i think that's that's
definitely a big problem so also in
terms of how he understands gto right
what is the objective of a solver
instead of just copying the solver
itself it's one of the philosophies that
i teach by as well we also always have

[2:40:45]
i teach by as well we also always have
to understand how is spot generate tv
and then as he mentioned a lot of people
in the 2012 they don't play like the
solver but because he understands how
the solver generates ev in a certain
situation he can then estimate the
situation in the pool that he's playing
and make the highest if he plays which

[2:41:01]
and make the highest if he plays which
are not necessarily what the solver does
but he learned certain principles from
the solver to basically have the highest
winnings at the games that he's
currently playing so yeah that's
very very strong
a very strong philosophy towards uh

[2:41:17]
a very strong philosophy towards uh
improving also in the technical side of
the game in my opinion so yeah
i mean like you said we can go on and on
and on and basically repeat everything
he just said in the podcast because it
was just all so much valuable stuff
