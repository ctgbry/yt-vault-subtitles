[00:00]
it's a board where the imposition has
the nut advantage the board run out
quite clean
uh usually if you have another advantage
and you come to the river
some percentage of the time some hands
would want to get their stack in to
apply maximum pressure
because i mean this is 866

[00:17]
because i mean this is 866
so 86 big blinds in the pot of 27 big
blinds which is quite a big
a big ass bet uh the guy is definitely
not afraid to put his money in
but then again it's a computer it
doesn't know any fear what's up

[00:30]
doesn't know any fear what's up
youtube welcome to another video here on
the poker ambition channel
today we're going to be talking about
the solver
versus practice what i mean with that is
what does the solver do and does this
apply
in practice now there's many players who

[00:45]
in practice now there's many players who
might not use a solver
and arguments that i often hear is that
yes
what the software does is too
complicated i don't know how to use it
or yeah what the solver does doesn't
apply in my games because they play
crazy they don't play gto

[01:01]
crazy they don't play gto
which are all valid arguments and are
true but shouldn't be used as argument
not to use a solver at all
so today i'm gonna try to show you
how you can still use a solver
to exploit your population that you're

[01:16]
to exploit your population that you're
playing
and i'm gonna do that by using a bluff
catching example
so the situation we're going to look at
today is
a big blind versus button scenario we
are here
hero and he is there the villain

[01:30]
hero and he is there the villain
the villain opened the button to 2.5 x
as we can see here on the left top of
the screen
we check he see that's one third we call
turn
we check and now it's up to villain so
two eighths
nine five four queen let's see what

[01:45]
nine five four queen let's see what
imposition is supposed to do
from a solver perspective so this is
what the impositions turn c betting
strategy would look like in theory
i've only given it an option to that pot
on the turn
for this example but i think actually

[02:00]
for this example but i think actually
this already touches on a
important topic let's say for example
you are looking at the solver from a
perspective okay what should i do
as in position here on the turn and
you've only given in the pod option
you it will show you the correct
solution when only being allowed to bat

[02:15]
solution when only being allowed to bat
pot but maybe the solver doesn't want to
bad pod maybe he wants to bet three
quarters maybe he points
but wants to bet 150 but if we don't
give him that option we will never know
but for argument's sake we will stick
with the pot
scenario so if our opponent is only

[02:31]
scenario so if our opponent is only
allowed to that pot which i think in
practice people
sometimes over bad sometimes bad three
quarters that's why i kind of ended up
picking pot and we look at the hand
choice we always see
solvers being quite randomizing you know

[02:46]
solvers being quite randomizing you know
he doesn't really
pick hands at 100 frequency except for
kings and aces
because the eevee of betting is quite
clear
better than checking with all other
hands when you see a mix
that means that in theory at least the

[03:00]
that means that in theory at least the
evs run
quite close so it doesn't really matter
it doesn't practice but not in theory
and it's kind of also to mix it up and
have various hands in various lines
the hands that i want to quickly focus
on if you look at turn c

[03:15]
on if you look at turn c
betting is that if you look at the hand
like 10 8 for example seven eight six
seven
ace deuce a streets which are all the
draws this board does contain quite a
lot of draws
that's also the reason why i chose this
board as an example

[03:30]
board as an example
because we can see here that the solver
is
quite balanced you could say with his
draws he doesn't bet him as
as high as a frequency as you would
maybe
do yourself so for example if i look at
this scenario and if i have six seven or

[03:46]
this scenario and if i have six seven or
seven
eight or maybe end like h3 i see like
okay i have an over a gutter
high card on the turn you know it's
quite a good card for me i will decide
to barrel
i won't come i won't probably i won't

[04:00]
i won't come i won't probably i won't
find
the twenty percent currency betting
strategy with seven eight
uh to be honest so
if you would then you know gg i wouldn't
um but this is the currency betting
strategy in position in theory

[04:15]
strategy in position in theory
let's look at what we should do
basically against this strategy we
should be folding around 53
of the time and we have pocket eights he
bets
pots we see that pocket has a clear fold
which makes quite a lot of sense i mean

[04:30]
which makes quite a lot of sense i mean
if he's
his bluffs mainly come from a lot of 8x
like jack 8 10 8 7
8 so yeah we usually when you want to
pick a hand to continue versus a barrel
we don't really want to have a hand
that blocks his bluffs and also aids has
quite poor improvability compared to a

[04:46]
quite poor improvability compared to a
hand like
five sticks for example has more outs
than a hand like pocket eight
five six also blocks like some value
bets like fives or queen five suited
four five suited et cetera
so five six would be clearly a better
call than pocket eights

[05:00]
call than pocket eights
so if this is where we stop our
studying or analyzing of this spot if we
wanted to know what should we do with
pocket aids
we now have the answer we fold and we've
played
the hand correctly if that would be the

[05:15]
the hand correctly if that would be the
case this would be a very short youtube
video
and i think we would have a lot of
disappointed viewers so
we're not gonna stop right there what
we're going to do is we're going to
compare
the gto imposition strategy with

[05:30]
the gto imposition strategy with
what population is doing so here we see
a board the board is
night high or lower and we can see
currency betting strategies of your
average mid-six population
this applies for cash entities it's all

[05:47]
this applies for cash entities it's all
the same
and we can see a trend that on a high
card turn barrel frequencies go up and a
low carb turn
barrel frequencies go down this i don't
think comes to us
comes as a surprise also think like i

[06:00]
comes as a surprise also think like i
said how would you approach a spot well
i would borrow it at a quite a high
frequency
which also shows in the data so
we have a 61.4 on average we do see that
on epmp and the cutoff
barrel frequency a bit higher on the
bottom but still we're

[06:16]
bottom but still we're
close to 60 and gto here is at 54. so we
can make the argument
that on this exact board
with all the draws being present and a
high card on the turn
the currency bidding strategy is gonna

[06:30]
the currency bidding strategy is gonna
definitely reach 60 and probably even go
over it so the next step would be
[Music]
to tell the solver that
we're not facing this strategy but we're

[06:45]
we're not facing this strategy but we're
facing this strategy
the response that we have as big blind
is always dependent on the strategy that
in this case the imposition button is
using
we're responding to a strategy so if
we go from 54 to let's say 62.

[07:03]
we go from 54 to let's say 62.
i've always made him stephen the term
with the hands like king jack
hands like six seven if he had it when
you see
uh it's partly black it means we don't
have this hand all the time
could be that we check the flop could be

[07:16]
could be that we check the flop could be
that we did an open preflop 100 of the
time
but mainly i focused on letting him bet
draws more often
i've also made him always bad king queen
i saw that in theory it sometimes
checks but i think most people always
barrel so

[07:30]
barrel so
then we reach around a 62 barrel
frequency
then if we compare the response that we
had
in theory which was the fault 53 percent
with the response that we should have in
practice so versus the population

[07:46]
practice so versus the population
we can clearly see we should not be
folding 53 percent
because imposition is barreling more
often than he
should therefore we should fault less
often than we
should if we then look at pocket h we
can see

[08:00]
can see
it's still folding some of the time the
eights that are usually continuing are
the eights with a heart
i gave us didn't give us a eight of
hearts on purpose because
else the example i think would be a bit
too obvious i want to go
take it to the extremes eighth with a

[08:15]
take it to the extremes eighth with a
diamond and a spade
was folding around sixty percent of the
time from the top of my head
and that is because when you have a
heart basically if he barrels hearts
uh he has less equity because we already
have a heart and also if we improve

[08:31]
have a heart and also if we improve
to to a set on the river which is very
unlikely but
if we have a heart it will always be an
eight that doesn't
improve fill into a flush so basically
our outs are cleaner and we can clearly

[08:45]
our outs are cleaner and we can clearly
see that
uh hands like for example five six was a
frequency call now it's always a call
even a hand like let me see king 5
king 4 now suddenly become calls wires
in theory it would be a fault
so this is clearly a situation where

[09:01]
so this is clearly a situation where
indeed practice plays different than
theory so yes we should also respond
different than theory okay so we called
stubborn as we are we didn't go for the
60 folding frequency because can't win

[09:17]
60 folding frequency because can't win
if you fault don't take this advice too
literally
so the river's nase brings in another
scare card
and it's we're gonna check the villain
not really a reason to dunk that here on

[09:31]
not really a reason to dunk that here on
the river
so let's see what villain should do in
theory
villain in theory again you know
in this case i gave it four sizings in
theory
it has the three quarters which it

[09:45]
it has the three quarters which it
prefers
at the highest frequency and it also has
some all ins it's a board where the
imposition has
the nut advantage the board run out
quite clean uh
usually if you have another advantage
and you come to the river
some percentage of the time some hands

[10:00]
some percentage of the time some hands
would want to get their stack in to
apply maximum pressure
because i mean this is 866
so 86 big blinds in a pot of 27 big
blinds which is quite a big
a big ass bet the guy is definitely not
afraid to put his money in

[10:15]
afraid to put his money in
but then again it's a computer it
doesn't know any fear
so check's around 49 so we have roughly
a 50
betting frequency here in theory
[Music]
if we then look at our response pocket

[10:30]
if we then look at our response pocket
eights clearly
a fault
so again if we would end the video here
it wouldn't be as
exciting as you know like i said you
cannot win if you fall so let's see if
we can maybe squeeze out a call

[10:46]
we can maybe squeeze out a call
but yeah clearly again aids for the same
reasons we wanted to fall on the turn we
should fall on the river
but now the question is is this strategy
represent for your population let's take
a quick
look um 7 8 again is checking some of

[11:02]
look um 7 8 again is checking some of
the time king 8 is checking
a high frequency actually all king x are
checking king jack king 10
king 8 king 7 um whereas again
put yourself in our shoes let's say we
are villains so we have opened the

[11:15]
are villains so we have opened the
button we see that at the flop barrel
the turn and now the river comes the ace
what are you gonna do with your seven
eight are you gonna check
and lose the pot or are you gonna bet
and try to win the pot let's be honest
here i'm gonna
join join the club off i would probably

[11:30]
join join the club off i would probably
bet and try to win the bot
which like i said in theory doesn't
necessarily happen
that's quite a lot of give ups
if we look again at what population

[11:45]
if we look again at what population
is doing we can kind of see the same
trends on the turn
when a high card comes on the river uh
compared to a low carb barrel
frequencies come up
like i said this is quite natural
i think it shouldn't be a surprise that
that we see this

[12:00]
that we see this
um here on the ace river this is the
exact texture low board high turn high
river we can see a 64
betting frequency well theory as we just
showed
only had a fifty percent betting
frequency so then
of course we've again concluded like hey

[12:18]
of course we've again concluded like hey
in practice something is happening
that's different than a theory so we
shouldn't
follow theory and we should use our
brains i guess what would you do if

[12:30]
brains i guess what would you do if
someone
is barreling more often than he should
we should fold
less often it's as simple as that so
if we take the strategy for argument's
sake again i've only used
a three-quarter strategy and it went up
from

[12:45]
from
what was it 50 check i added 10 bets
and mainly focused on not never checking
seven eight
uh still actually checking quite a lot
of king jack king 10.
like i said up to you if you think this
is relevant for
your population or for the villain you

[13:01]
your population or for the villain you
are playing against
but it's maybe interesting for now for
you to think like okay
he's barreling more you already barreled
more than a turn he's not barreling more
on the river
what what's your response pause the

[13:16]
what what's your response pause the
video for a second and think about like
okay
how will i respond okay
no most people are going to be impatient
and i never stop videos at this point
going to be honest with you but let's
see

[13:30]
see
spoiler alert if you did want to think
about it
what we should do
theory 46 fault practice 4
faults okay so basically
we never fought if we now look at pocket

[13:47]
we never fought if we now look at pocket
dates which was clear default it's now
clearly a call but then again
everything becomes a call and
this is something that happens
in practice quite often things aren't

[14:02]
in practice quite often things aren't
necessarily as close in practice as they
are in theory so
also adjustments or place become
more of a hundred percent and zero
frequency than in theory
also if you would look at for example we

[14:16]
also if you would look at for example we
stick with the h because it's literally
like the worst possible bluff catcher
but then again i mean he's betting three
quarters of the time
uh three quarters of the pot sorry so we
need to be right around 30
so if we take a look at pocket eights

[14:31]
so if we take a look at pocket eights
pockets is gonna be good around
thirty five point five percent versus
that betting range but even ahead like
king jack for example
which sony king high it's gonna be good
36 percent
basically there is no hand except for he
did have some folds which is six seven

[14:45]
did have some folds which is six seven
okay
six seven doesn't even beat seven eight
so yeah we should probably fold six
seven
but if you're approaching this spot from
a perspective of okay yeah eight i'm
always folding because it's a bad bluff
catcher
then you're clearly missing the point

[15:01]
then you're clearly missing the point
here
because yes what is the best bluff
catcher here
yes queen three you know not blocking
any bluffs
maybe blocking a straight for the tree
do suit it i don't think i gave it 3d
suited on the button anyway
but i mean it's blocking some valiant

[15:16]
but i mean it's blocking some valiant
it's not blocking blush so
from a blocker perspective this is
definitely
a better call and in theory having 2.5
more equity versus the balance range is
gonna make a huge
difference but to come to a main

[15:30]
difference but to come to a main
conclusion
in theory okay blockers are gonna be the
difference between
a call being plus a v or minus ev that
is because
you know the the solver is more balanced
and the equities are quite close if
these are quite close

[15:45]
these are quite close
so as you can see the two and a half
percent that queen three suited have
more than a hand like queen 10 or queen
jack
is definitely going to matter and it's
going to be the difference between
calling and folding
however as we saw in practice it's going
to only make the difference
between a plus or v call being a bit

[16:01]
between a plus or v call being a bit
more plus a v
and a minus v call being a bit less
minor cv
all right because as you saw the
adjustments
should be huge all right
[Music]
so to just quickly sum it up here at the

[16:15]
so to just quickly sum it up here at the
end
uh three main takeaways that i would get
from this videos i've already selected
it for you guys
is be very careful copying
river actually it says river decision
but in general be very careful copying

[16:30]
but in general be very careful copying
decisions from a solver for you people
who said like
yeah but what the solver is doing isn't
applicable for my games
you are indeed right but don't let it
stop you from using the solver
all right for the people who've only

[16:47]
all right for the people who've only
been copying
solvers they basically would have
already stopped
evaluating the hand at the turn when we
have folded eight because the culver is
a silver set
that we had to fold think look at the
imposition

[17:00]
imposition
look always look at the the strategy
that the your opponent is using
and see if that correlates with gto
because only then gto applies which
brings us to point two
we have to think less so this is for the
more gto copying players

[17:16]
more gto copying players
think less about how your range should
play or how your range should respond in
theory
and this is quite obvious for me at
least
think more about what your opponent has
that's also why i added the smiley face

[17:30]
that's also why i added the smiley face
i would say that poker is being made
maybe a bit too complicated it's kind of
the curse of the modern day poker
industry with the solvers
and we want to play gto and correct etc
in the end it's quite simple
figure out what your opponent has and
then figure out if your hand has enough
equity to call

[17:46]
equity to call
point number three things are often
not closed in practice so blockers
matter less
i think this should be a very important
takeaway if you
are in a situation estimate if the
situation is

[18:00]
situation is
close if it is close then by all means
do take
blockers in consideration very highly if
the situation you think is less close
because villain is clearly over bluffing
or
under bluffing or due to the texture
deformation whatever

[18:16]
deformation whatever
make a read based on that and you know
let go of blockers for a little bit
so i hope you guys enjoyed this video
