spewed it off
[Music]
got a little announcement for you guys
because next to our mechanics of poker
program and master classes we have now
released the poker ambition academy in
this academy you will be receiving
weekly interactive webinars based on
your pain points we will be discussing
all areas that you can improve in to
become a more successful poker player
taught by coaches who have walked the
path that you're currently walking so if
you're interested go over to the site
and looking forward to seeing you in
that academy i have to say guys i just
started up and as you can see i have 182
big blinds here and i have 224 big
blinds there it's because mr secretary
from russia
okay
yeah he got unlucky he got cooler twice
basically i flopped upset in his rebound
but he turned trips
on queen 10 7 he had king 10 there was a
yeah they are gonna lose your money it's
as easy as that
and he got him big blind versus button
with jax which is you know if he does
that as a frequency it's fine i usually
prefer call calling versus the forbes
but he
snap ripped it in definitely is snap a
snap player
snap players always tell me a little bit
you know they make their decision snap
snap snap snap snap hello the snapper
strategy has been tried by many but well
executed by few i think it can
be performed to your advantage as it can
pre
produce
reciprocal behavior
what do you mean
and tails from otherwise solid guys yes
true it does tilt me you know who was
very good at that
uh inner spy i mean he still plays right
at the over at gg shout out to mrs shout
out to the gg streets if you guys
have any suggestions for clips you know
sometimes we'll get suggested for clips
it's been actually a while
which is obviously quite unfortunate
but please you know
send them over i'm a little bit i'm lost
in inspiration i need some i need some i
need some more inspiration for clips
actually i did download one that was
everyone loves to chop but i thought i
say that when there's a chatbot but
obviously we can just play the clip that
would uh maybe be nicer this is probably
an okay hand to check race some of the
time
let's go for that
been in culls
[Music]
not really sure what to bet i mean doubt
between one third and half pot so i went
that's my solution
i can do two things on the river
i was endowed between
betting myself and check folding
i mean like it's not like we have the
nuts right
eights jacks tents kings aces
so i
think jamming
is a little bit overdone
then you could consider a block
that's always a fine play
if we check his main blocks are gonna be
king queen
or ace queen
that's very unlikely given the hand that
we have so i think we have an easy check
fold
you do very well versus the check back
range and very badly versus the betting
range
usually leading towards stack folding
yes
very good advice wacko
uh
yeah interesting
you obviously don't make money on the
calls against nits but you make money
when they don't bluff you
off your weak [ __ ] exactly basically you
get to over realize
she showdowns too often
so you make money versus the other part
of his range obviously you spot a nit
you know
don't call the nits
right
you you want a good dipping poker out
and make a lot of money
call this call the spewers and don't
call the nits
i have to say this is definitely one of
the better advice that uh that i've
given
this guy here is a little bit [ __ ] on
the turn
range wise
did we induce something did the
induction sizing work yes it worked
snapping off again
he just snapped spewed it off
my friend
you don't
you don't watch my berklia you don't
watch mac berkeley i will show you
um by betting small i sort of opened
myself up to this yeah i opened myself
up to that but i wanted to open myself
up
it seems to be an induction size
where
i think he thinks i would fall for this
with
one pair type holdings um
yeah this guy uh
yeah
also calling preflop with 108 suited out
of position mp versus button
you know
not that solid where is he from russia
right you know what time it is guys
i want to bring the russians down more
russians bring more russians on
i'm here to get them all
sweden sweden sweden
we start straight away from the bat
let's go three pair
he makes a little bluffy buffy with the
ace for blockers
okay he blocked the nut flush give it to
me baby
give me [ __ ] what the [ __ ] do you need
some help playing three bad pots out of
position well for that we have created
our master classes in which we dedicate
one coaching program to dive very deep
into a specific spot go over to the site
pokermission.com master classes and
eliminate those weaknesses
that's i think actually
i mean obviously we're calling
flop is close
in these positions
but given the fact that it was a weird
spot you know maybe it's a little bit
lighter i know
and the queen of clubs here on the turn
is not great
so i think there's a barrel i'm going to
fold
checks
so yeah to continue my story
the mystery guest he has explained me a
lot about how to play against
recreationals he explained a lot of my
students
how to play versus recreationals
interesting sizing i would
i would say normally
but i don't really know this guy is uh
marked him as a little bit of
yeah
semi something
because like normally i would say that
if i was beat he would have went all in
but with him i cannot guarantee that so
i think i'm just gonna call it's a
little bit it's a little bit weak maybe
but i feel like there's still a chance
that i'm beat
versus this guy
but okay i'll give myself a little bit
of the chicken song where is the chicken
song
chicken chicken chicken a little bit
cheeky a little tricky
[Music]
oh sweden three bets shall we slow slow
players ass i'm gonna slow play s it's a
good flop oh sweden
my friend
just be yourself and give me your stack
it's all you have to do
it's a good turn
one second barboza i will get back to
your great advice
once we've stacked sweden oh man so many
jigs
do you never learn wacko why do you keep
on jinxing a good point
he doesn't barrel
it's quite weird
[Music]
sweden doesn't barrel this turn
it's weird actually
it's a bit weird
why does sweden not barrel this turn
like that is complete monkeys or he's
trapping me
[Music]
i mean i cannot not raise this right
so he was medium
and he can still be medium that's
definitely an option just like nines or
something eights sevens
okay near ramses wants to get an ace
king well i'm very happy to do so guys
let's go all in with ace king and then
you know what time it is
let's go on ace king what the [ __ ] let's
gamble baby girl here we go baby girl
here we go okay
come on [ __ ]
guys jacks oh my god
king
we hit
no now we did it but we hit it
these streets should be softer these
days without the duchess yes for sure
i'm very happy no more need to my tree
no more flu suit no more tunas
very happy that they're gone
more for the weka now
more for the weko
will you play 5k on gg poke anytime in
the future yes actually i've
been adding
5k now to my grind
then when i want to reduce 1k i will add
gg on 5k pro but i would say probably
beginning next year and this year
like that
interesting river
can we buy the webinar after it has been
done only for um
for
let's say
you subscribe afterwards you can buy a
webinar in the past but that's only for
guys who have a subscription
but if you buy it now and you cannot
participate you can rewatch it yes
but you cannot go back in the library
and buy
uh webinars like with sweden it's
so tricky on one side you're like i'm
gonna call this 10 jack because i can
sometimes make a beautiful hand and then
we get a lot of money
the other side it's like yeah we often
gonna flop a marginal pair and then he's
gonna barrel and then i have to call
down and then we could lose
but hey
no risk no glory
something something like that right
it's the quote
batter
it's a very bad turn
like a sizing
i feel so induced here
good falls on a king of diamond river
it's a very good sizing like sweden is a
funky guy man like sometimes he does a
couple things very right in my opinion
top of the top of the top of the two
pair
how aggressive has this guy been
i already recall
it is quite a big bet i should have bet
it a little bit smaller
now that's what they call the worst turn
in the deck
what do we do on the worst turn in the
deck
not sure about this one
and it's also the worst river
why did he call that
i think that's probably always a squeeze
i played that badly
i mean he played his hand badly but i
also played mohammed badly
let's take full responsibility here
should not have bet the term
i think betting the turn is okay versus
the big blinds range but not versus
small blinds range now if you liked this
