of my poker career was definitely

[10:21]
of my poker career was definitely

[10:21]
of my poker career was definitely
when I busted my role,

[10:24]
when I busted my role,

[10:24]
when I busted my role,
uh, I think right around a year into me

[10:27]
uh, I think right around a year into me

[10:27]
uh, I think right around a year into me
playing poker full-time. The first year

[10:29]
playing poker full-time. The first year

[10:29]
playing poker full-time. The first year
that I played, I went from 2NL to

[10:33]
that I played, I went from 2NL to

that I played, I went from 2NL to
actually being rolled and playing 200 NL

rake back. you could get above 100% rake

[10:44]
rake back. you could get above 100% rake

[10:44]
rake back. you could get above 100% rake
back for a time. And so even if I didn't

[10:48]
back for a time. And so even if I didn't

[10:48]
back for a time. And so even if I didn't
have the best results pre- rakeback,

[10:50]
have the best results pre- rakeback,

[10:50]
have the best results pre- rakeback,
since rakeback was so high, it was

[10:51]
since rakeback was so high, it was

[10:51]
since rakeback was so high, it was
pretty comfortable to to make good

[10:54]
pretty comfortable to to make good

[10:54]
pretty comfortable to to make good
money. And I also wasn't I wasn't very

[10:57]
money. And I also wasn't I wasn't very

[10:57]
money. And I also wasn't I wasn't very
good at poker at the time. It was just

[10:59]
good at poker at the time. It was just

[10:59]
good at poker at the time. It was just
an easier environment, I would say, to

[11:00]
an easier environment, I would say, to

[11:00]
an easier environment, I would say, to
to make money back then. And so when

[11:03]
to make money back then. And so when

[11:03]
to make money back then. And so when
that got taken away, I transitioned to

[11:05]
that got taken away, I transitioned to

[11:05]
that got taken away, I transitioned to
GG poker. And I had like I had a

[11:10]
GG poker. And I had like I had a

[11:10]
GG poker. And I had like I had a
negative win rate pre- rakeback as I

[11:12]
negative win rate pre- rakeback as I

[11:12]
negative win rate pre- rakeback as I
think a lot of people still do. But it

[11:15]
think a lot of people still do. But it

[11:15]
think a lot of people still do. But it
was it was still winning after rakeback,

[11:17]
was it was still winning after rakeback,

[11:17]
was it was still winning after rakeback,
but it wasn't a big margin. And I felt

[11:19]
but it wasn't a big margin. And I felt

[11:19]
but it wasn't a big margin. And I felt
like I wasn't actually I felt like I was

[11:21]
like I wasn't actually I felt like I was

[11:21]
like I wasn't actually I felt like I was
kind of at a dead end where I wasn't

[11:23]
kind of at a dead end where I wasn't

[11:23]
kind of at a dead end where I wasn't
sure what to do to improve. And so that

[11:27]
sure what to do to improve. And so that

[11:27]
sure what to do to improve. And so that
led me to looking into other things.

[11:30]
led me to looking into other things.

and less of when you go play live

[42:10]
and less of when you go play live

[42:10]
and less of when you go play live
compared to online? And what are kind of

the adjustment? Why is it why is it

[42:14]
the adjustment? Why is it why is it

[42:14]
the adjustment? Why is it why is it
different? Well, I think the biggest

[42:15]
different? Well, I think the biggest

[42:15]
different? Well, I think the biggest
thing or or one of the biggest

[42:18]
thing or or one of the biggest

[42:18]
thing or or one of the biggest
differences between live and online is

[42:20]
differences between live and online is

[42:20]
differences between live and online is
the proportion of recreationals in the

[42:22]
the proportion of recreationals in the

[42:22]
the proportion of recreationals in the
pool. Um, online at higher stakes, it's

[42:26]
pool. Um, online at higher stakes, it's

[42:26]
pool. Um, online at higher stakes, it's
very rare to to find more than, you

[42:27]
very rare to to find more than, you

[42:28]
very rare to to find more than, you
know, one recreational at the table.

[42:30]
know, one recreational at the table.

[42:30]
know, one recreational at the table.
Compared to live, you know, you you can

[42:33]
Compared to live, you know, you you can

[42:33]
Compared to live, you know, you you can
have tables where they're where all of

[42:36]
have tables where they're where all of

[42:36]
have tables where they're where all of
the other players are recreationals. So,

[42:39]
the other players are recreationals. So,

[42:39]
the other players are recreationals. So,
what does that mean? That means that

[42:42]
what does that mean? That means that

[42:42]
what does that mean? That means that
the skill set you need in live is to try

[42:44]
the skill set you need in live is to try

[42:44]
the skill set you need in live is to try
to extract the maximum, you know, from

[42:47]
to extract the maximum, you know, from

[42:47]
to extract the maximum, you know, from
amateur players and and try to

[42:51]
amateur players and and try to

[42:51]
amateur players and and try to
exploit as much as possible. And and

[42:52]
exploit as much as possible. And and

[42:52]
exploit as much as possible. And and
online is a lot more about playing a a

[42:55]
online is a lot more about playing a a

[42:55]
online is a lot more about playing a a
theoretically solid game. I mean, you

[42:57]
theoretically solid game. I mean, you

[42:57]
theoretically solid game. I mean, you
still want to deviate a lot against

[42:59]
still want to deviate a lot against

[42:59]
still want to deviate a lot against
rags, but they're much the deviations

[43:01]
rags, but they're much the deviations

[43:01]
rags, but they're much the deviations
are much smaller. Um, so yeah, online is

[43:04]
are much smaller. Um, so yeah, online is

[43:04]
are much smaller. Um, so yeah, online is
a lot more of a theoretical

[43:07]
a lot more of a theoretical

[43:07]
a lot more of a theoretical
solid game for me, whereas live is is a

[43:11]
solid game for me, whereas live is is a

[43:11]
solid game for me, whereas live is is a
lot more freestyling.

[43:12]
lot more freestyling.

[43:12]
lot more freestyling.
Um, and then there's obviously the

[43:14]
Um, and then there's obviously the

[43:14]
Um, and then there's obviously the
element of, you know, live reads and,

[43:17]
element of, you know, live reads and,

[43:17]
element of, you know, live reads and,
you know, trying to gain information

[43:19]
you know, trying to gain information

[43:20]
you know, trying to gain information
about people's hands by looking at them

[43:22]
about people's hands by looking at them

[43:22]
about people's hands by looking at them
and paying attention to how they're

[43:24]
and paying attention to how they're

[43:24]
and paying attention to how they're
acting. So, yeah, I think those are the

[43:27]
acting. So, yeah, I think those are the

[43:27]
acting. So, yeah, I think those are the
two biggest differences for me. If

[43:29]

you can you see immediately the root
cause of any future problem will

[55:05]
cause of any future problem will

[55:05]
cause of any future problem will
probably come from this data that you

[55:06]
probably come from this data that you

[55:06]
probably come from this data that you
now collected. So I think not only

indeed does it make future volume

you will have, right? Because it shows
