[00:00]
We have gathered five of the top
competitors in the Midsix Cash Game
World Championship. In part one, they
showed you how they prepared and
performed in the challenge.
&gt;&gt; It honestly surprised me how aggressive
people were pre flop.
&gt;&gt; People were just like laughing way more.

[00:15]
&gt;&gt; People were just like laughing way more.
&gt;&gt; Now, in part two, they will review the
road that got them there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I'm not kidding when I say I I
think I had like 451 when saw flop. My
red line was in China. like things were
not looking good for me
&gt;&gt; last year when I first shot 1k. I think

[00:31]
&gt;&gt; last year when I first shot 1k. I think
it was the most
difficult period of time.
&gt;&gt; I had to move down the stakes and uh I
couldn't climb back.
&gt;&gt; It was crazy. Like I I think I was
playing and studying maybe 200 hours a

[00:45]
playing and studying maybe 200 hours a
week. It was crazy. I was doing nothing
else.
&gt;&gt; I've made four WSOP final two tables and
never made a final table. And so like my
whole live poker career has really come
down to like four or five hands.
&gt;&gt; The struggle, the doubt, the

[01:00]
&gt;&gt; The struggle, the doubt, the
breakthrough moments.
&gt;&gt; I think success is something related to
happiness.
&gt;&gt; Poker just cannot be the only thing that
you're doing because when poker goes
badly, your life goes badly. So
&gt;&gt; kind of realized that I should just stop
chasing easy money in crypto and just

[01:16]
chasing easy money in crypto and just
focus on poker, which is what got me to
where I was in the first place. is I
want to win a, you know, significant
live tournament, preferably at WSOP.
I've always wanted a bracelet.
&gt;&gt; This is how they became who they are.
&gt;&gt; What I think would give me the most

[01:30]
&gt;&gt; What I think would give me the most
fulfillment is
&gt;&gt; What would you say was the lowest or
most challenging part of your po career?
&gt;&gt; Um, lowest moment coming up? Well, there

[01:45]
&gt;&gt; Um, lowest moment coming up? Well, there
have been several. I guess the first one
I ever had was
um in college I was playing um app games
like cash games on apps like Poker 2 and
stuff like that and

[02:00]
stuff like that and
at the time was doing really well at
stakes from like 25 to 1020 had grown my
bankroll um from basically nothing to a
pretty decent level. Um, and then I shot
took a very big game for me at the time,

[02:15]
took a very big game for me at the time,
big game for me still. It was like a
5100 game. Um, and was a complete idiot
uh with bankroll management at the time
and had at one point like 25% or 30% of
my bankroll uh in play um and didn't

[02:32]
my bankroll uh in play um and didn't
sell for the game and ended up losing
it. So I lost like close to a third
maybe like a quarter of my bankroll in
in one day in that game. And um yeah, I
was just pretty devastated emotionally
at that. And um from that point onwards

[02:47]
at that. And um from that point onwards
have been way way better about uh being
smart with bankroll management and you
know making sure not to not to lose that
much in one day. Um, so that was the

[03:00]
much in one day. Um, so that was the
first sort of speed bump. And then, uh,
in MTTS, I
had very smooth sailing for the first
two years of playing. Um, not really any
down swings that were that significant.

[03:15]
down swings that were that significant.
Um, and then and around September of
last year, um, there was a series going
on and I just played way too high. um
fired way too hard and ended up going on
another pretty big downswing around a

[03:31]
another pretty big downswing around a
quarter of my role over two or 3 months.
So um sort of learned the same lesson
again, but but this time, you know, it
it was a lot more like a lot more of a
calculated shot take um as compared to

[03:46]
calculated shot take um as compared to
the first one. So um don't feel too bad
about the second one. But yeah, those
are I guess are the two biggest uh bumps
in in my road as a as a poker player.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd like to dig into both those a
bit deeper. In terms of losing a third

[04:00]
bit deeper. In terms of losing a third
of your role in one day at that stage of
career must have felt pretty intense.
How did you uh deal with that in that
shortterm period?
&gt;&gt; I don't know if I did anything like
super proactive at at the moment. I
just, you know, moved back down to my

[04:16]
just, you know, moved back down to my
normal games on and grinded it back up.
um and just sort of vowed to myself that
I wouldn't let that happen again uh
going forward. You know, would make sure
to sell a reasonable amount next time I
shot took a game that big. And and you

[04:32]
shot took a game that big. And and you
know, I I was so young at the time,
maybe 20 or 21, that I kind of felt
like, you know, it's whatever. I can
just shot take this huge game and if it
doesn't go well, I'll grind it back up.
But yeah, I still don't think it it was

[04:46]
But yeah, I still don't think it it was
the smartest. But yeah, I just I just
moved down and and uh played my normal
games for the next few months.
&gt;&gt; I think I'm kind of going through it for
the last couple of years because uh

[05:02]
the last couple of years because uh
I had to move down the stakes and uh I
couldn't climb back
um for for few reasons. I think the main
thing

[05:15]
thing
is belief like deep down I know I'm not
intelligent enough to beat the high
stakes
kind of thing and uh also
I kind of feel I have to sacrifice

[05:32]
I kind of feel I have to sacrifice
too much in order to do it. It's kind of
hard to balance to be like a top level
athlete and like having a family, having
a hobbies, having like

[05:46]
a hobbies, having like
some time off. So, it's kind of a
question of what you want more, I think.
Yeah. And I'm I keep reflecting on it
like I enjoy playing poker. I don't want

[06:00]
like I enjoy playing poker. I don't want
to do
anything else. I love the game and um I
find a fulfillment um in
in going deeper into one thing and this
is the thing I love. like

[06:19]
is the thing I love. like
it makes sense for me to keep doing it
and uh I kind of want to achieve uh like
mastery at the game but at the same time

[06:31]
mastery at the game but at the same time
uh I keep not putting
necessary effort for it. So yeah, I need
to think on it, reflect on it more.
Yeah, sounds like a bit of internal
battle there in terms of
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because uh it happened like uh

[06:48]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because uh it happened like uh
right after the challenges that I was uh
thinking, okay, like uh you play this
game 15 years and you still kind of play
it uh mid average level and like blah

[07:03]
it uh mid average level and like blah
blah blah like you're not good enough,
blah blah blah. Beat yourself to it.
Like my wife said, my wife said, "Fuck
you just won this thing and you are not
happy

[07:15]
happy
that you are
because I was thinking 15 years and I
still play like not still but like
um I think my identity is
attached to being a poker player and

[07:31]
attached to being a poker player and
it's like uh plays a huge part in my
self representation and I
I probably would like to be like more
achieve something more. Yeah,

[07:46]
achieve something more. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I think um well I've been just playing
professionally for two years. I know
poker from more time but uh since I quit
my last job that I was like a uh working
in an office in a big uh law firm um

[08:02]
in an office in a big uh law firm um
it's been only two years. So during that
time,
I think I've been running really good.
But last year when I first shot 1k,

[08:15]
But last year when I first shot 1k,
I think it was the most
difficult period of time in a three or
four months period of time where I
wasn't winning any money, maybe losing a
little bit, but feel that all of the

[08:31]
little bit, but feel that all of the
opponents were quite better than me.
Like I think the jump between 500 and 1K
is so big because in 1K you have some
players that just play from 1K to 5K or
even more. And in five 500 and you have

[08:47]
even more. And in five 500 and you have
a lot of medium cast game players which
basically have
my level during that time. So also in
moneywise talking uh I felt that the

[09:02]
moneywise talking uh I felt that the
swings were um affecting me a lot and I
need to like take a week or two weeks to
not play during that time because

[09:15]
not play during that time because
I wasn't playing right like I was
getting
I remember some of the ress that were
just battling me were like showing me
the showdown for just for fun or maybe
because they want to uh show I'm the

[09:33]
because they want to uh show I'm the
boss. You are just the new guy and we
just entered this pool.
This is what you have to do to to play.
And I would feel I was feeling like
really bad of myself
kind of off of my ego. I was like uh

[09:47]
kind of off of my ego. I was like uh
suffering a little bit during that time
because I was like okay these guys are
really good. Um, so yeah, I think my
rocket bomb moment was that and I think
yeah, I just took probably some weeks to

[10:00]
yeah, I just took probably some weeks to
rest, play lower stakes, build my
confidence, study more and yeah, I think
for example
now that almost one year or a little bit
less have pass in that moment, I feel
that I just improve in every spot of the

[10:15]
that I just improve in every spot of the
game. For me, the most challenging part
of my poker career was definitely
when I busted my role,
uh, I think right around a year into me
playing poker full-time. The first year
that I played, I went from 2NL to

[10:33]
that I played, I went from 2NL to
actually being rolled and playing 200 NL
as my main game. Um, it was during a
time where Party Poker had really good
rake back. you could get above 100% rake
back for a time. And so even if I didn't

[10:48]
back for a time. And so even if I didn't
have the best results pre- rakeback,
since rakeback was so high, it was
pretty comfortable to to make good
money. And I also wasn't I wasn't very
good at poker at the time. It was just
an easier environment, I would say, to

[11:00]
an easier environment, I would say, to
to make money back then. And so when
that got taken away, I transitioned to
GG poker. And I had like I had a
negative win rate pre- rakeback as I
think a lot of people still do. But it

[11:15]
think a lot of people still do. But it
was it was still winning after rakeback,
but it wasn't a big margin. And I felt
like I wasn't actually I felt like I was
kind of at a dead end where I wasn't
sure what to do to improve. And so that
led me to looking into other things.

[11:30]
led me to looking into other things.
Like I I kind of got distracted with
poker and I was looking into crypto.
Long story short, I ended up uh trying
to trade futures and
which is just like leveraged uh crypto
trading and I busted my role nearly

[11:45]
trading and I busted my role nearly
entirely on that as well as just having
big expenses at the time. I was running
two places, one in London, one in the
Netherlands. And so before I knew it,
like both of these things kind of piled
up on me and I lost all the way down to

[12:01]
up on me and I lost all the way down to
like $120 I had left from I think I had
a 20,000 roll at the time uh before that
point. So I busted like yeah 20k in just
a few months.
This sounds like a painful experience.
How did you uh recover from that? What

[12:16]
How did you uh recover from that? What
was the the moment you got yourself back
on your feet or how did you pick
yourself up from that low point? Yeah.
So, when this happened, I I kind of
realized that I should just stop chasing
trying easy money in crypto and just
focus on poker, which is what got me to

[12:31]
focus on poker, which is what got me to
where I was in the first place. So,
yeah, I had $120
and I just went to 10L and I started
grinding from there. So, I remember the
first day I played 10NL. I I won 18

[12:46]
first day I played 10NL. I I won 18
buyins and I had $300. I played there
for I started playing 25 an hour and I
gradually built that up to a few
thousand.
Um at that point I still wasn't like I
wasn't a very good poker player to be
honest. So I got to a point where like

[13:01]
honest. So I got to a point where like
yeah I was making money at 25 an hour. I
built up a few thousand, but then I
spent two or three months being stuck
there where I I just wasn't making money
cuz I was shooting 100, losing my shot
100, reg grinding at 50 L, 25 an hour,

[13:17]
100, reg grinding at 50 L, 25 an hour,
shooting again, the shot failed. I sw
for a few months.
&gt;&gt; So, your first year as a pro, you went
on a 500 buying down swing. How was that
experience and how did you get yourself
out of that?
&gt;&gt; Uh, I binged the tournament for 400

[13:30]
&gt;&gt; Uh, I binged the tournament for 400
buyins.
Yeah. So, uh, yeah, I remember that and
I had a coach at the time. Um, that was
pretty pretty helpful because he was
just like, you know what to do, just
like keep going, you know, you can win
and like we study and go through hands

[13:47]
and like we study and go through hands
just like uh keep making me believe that
it was possible. So, he was probably
very helpful for me. Also, I just had a
lot of friends who was just playing the
same stake. So, we were talking a lot at

[14:00]
same stake. So, we were talking a lot at
the same time. So,
I guess like just having friends and
having a coach um just made me sort of
like at a time where I wasn't so
experienced in that and then throughout
the end of the year it was in 2020 I

[14:15]
the end of the year it was in 2020 I
just yeah being like a 20k score or
something 25k score and yeah was back on
track. So that was that was very very
relief relieving to be like uh having
such a big downswing and yeah also made
me like kind of understand variance a
lot you know sort of like you see a lot

[14:32]
lot you know sort of like you see a lot
of guys that been have been running very
hard in the start of their career and
then they get a normal downswing and
they just think they have like a huge
downswing because they have been playing
way too high from for the bank roll.
&gt;&gt; What was keeping you going through these

[14:45]
&gt;&gt; What was keeping you going through these
kind of sticky patches? What were you
kind of aiming for? Did you have a
certain level you were trying to get to?
Uh did you have some some expectations
that you could keep climbing up? How
were you able to uh keep pushing through
these kind of slow starting periods?
&gt;&gt; Honestly, like no, I actually didn't.

[15:02]
&gt;&gt; Honestly, like no, I actually didn't.
After a while, I was kind of reaching a
point where I was thinking this is um
this might just be the end of the the
road for me with poker because I'm
trying, you know, I'm playing. I'm not
even making much money. if my prospect

[15:16]
even making much money. if my prospect
yearly is going to be maybe I make 20 or
$30,000. I just rather do something else
because it's not it wasn't even
enjoyable for me at that point. So I was
actually coming to a point where I was
going to give it a few more months and
then yeah pack it in.

[15:30]
then yeah pack it in.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The thing for me in in Togo has
always been that I haven't had a plan B
because when I was going in when I was
in I don't know the word but I think
it's high school but whatever it's
called high school I was like 16 years
old 16 17 18 years old um I already knew

[15:47]
old 16 17 18 years old um I already knew
at that time that I would not go to
university
so I was kind of like thinking what am I
going to do like I'm not going to go to
university so I have to do something and
and I didn't just want to have some
normal job I would be bored to Well, um,

[16:02]
normal job I would be bored to Well, um,
so when I found poker and I knew it was
possible to make a living out of poker
and I love playing poker so much, I kind
of already knew like I wasn't really
going to tell anyone because everyone
would just laugh like if you like if
you're starting from from the bottom and

[16:17]
you're starting from from the bottom and
you will tell people that you're going
to be a professional poker player,
people will ask you if you have a
problem or if you're like they will
start laughing, right? So, it's like a
silent sort of plan where I just knew
like there's no plan B. This is what I'm
going for. So even throughout this

[16:31]
going for. So even throughout this
downstream, I didn't have any plan B. It
wasn't like, oh, I'm now I'm going to go
back to doing something else. Like, no,
I was just no plan B. So, this was just
meant to be sort of thing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It reminds me of a quote from Will

[16:45]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It reminds me of a quote from Will
Smith. He says, "There's no reason for a
plan B because it distracts from plan
A." I think that was you like no
distractions and you're fully committed
with this in terms of what you learned
about yourself. I think you probably
learned some valuable lessons throughout
this downswing that probably set you up
well for the rest of your career. Can

[17:00]
well for the rest of your career. Can
you look back and think of anything that
this downswing helped you for later on?
&gt;&gt; I mean it it just it made me respect
variance. Um so um I do feel like I have
a very good understanding of variance. I
feel like I've talked with my friends

[17:15]
feel like I've talked with my friends
about this but I feel like in like we
are all for some reason we all like NPCs
of the of the variants. Like it's like
some guys have been running above EV in
their career and they they will think
like oh my return on investment in this

[17:31]
like oh my return on investment in this
entity is going to be 80%. And then
there was going to be guys that has been
running not as well and they would be
thinking my return on investment is
going to be 20%. And it's, you know, and
sort of like people when they're running

[17:45]
sort of like people when they're running
hot or when they're running bad, it's
sort of like their expectations of their
return on investment in different
entities is going to be changing. I I'm
I'm talking in in live entities here in
general, right?
&gt;&gt; What was the turning point for you when
you realized that you maybe had absorbed
enough knowledge to become a good player

[18:01]
enough knowledge to become a good player
yourself and you weren't just following
your coach's advice?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so like I mean I learned very
quickly, right? Because we had like I
think we had two sessions every week. So
I was like playing a lot and then we
like went through the hands a lot. So
very quickly I started getting it right.

[18:15]
very quickly I started getting it right.
So like my improve my improvement went
up a lot in the beginning and then I
think our deal just went from maybe was
a month at a time or two months or 3
months at a time. So just like at a
point where I was like okay now I'm
actually I'm at a very decent level. I

[18:31]
actually I'm at a very decent level. I
can go for myself. And um I made my
coach some money that's very nice. And
we made some money together. We still
have a good relationship. So now I'll
just go on my own because I have the
knowledge and sort of like confidence
that I can I can see now what's going

[18:46]
that I can I can see now what's going
on.
&gt;&gt; I think what gives me like I've been
realizing what what I think would give
me the most fulfillment is achieving
sort of mastery excellence at your

[19:00]
sort of mastery excellence at your
craft. And um this level is uh
is not what I consider to be like um
being like a master of my craft like

[19:16]
being like a master of my craft like
uh also playing higher stakes has its
own caves. Uh I've been playing past few
weeks uh 1K 2K and it's just uh not many
games running and uh I'm kind of in a

[19:33]
games running and uh I'm kind of in a
good time zone. So it's quite upsetting.
So it's kind of you don't see where to
go. like that 10 years ago you can see
like lobby um full of maybe 15 years ago

[19:47]
like lobby um full of maybe 15 years ago
you can see a lo full of 5k tables like
so it's basically there is nowhere to
play higher and if you play higher you

[20:01]
play higher and if you play higher you
would have to compete with the best so
it's kind of risky thing to do as well
can take a huge to bankroll
And uh it's not something which you have
a full control on because of the huge

[20:18]
a full control on because of the huge
variance with the scene engines.
So it's a tricky thing.
But I still enjoy just uh just uh the
grind, you know, like

[20:31]
grind, you know, like
it usually like
uh when I smoke potent or take shrooms
like I actually enjoying my lifestyle,
but uh on some other days like I'm kind
of beating myself up that uh I'm not

[20:46]
of beating myself up that uh I'm not
putting much effort blah blah blah. So
it's kind of goes phases. Are you
grinding hard, studying solvers,
reviewing hands, but still not getting
those results that you know you're
capable of? You're putting in the time
and effort, but without clear direction,

[21:02]
and effort, but without clear direction,
that effort does not pay off. That is
why I created the Mechanics Leakbuster
program, which is the exact system I
used to make over seven figures playing
online poker and have since taught to
hundreds of students so they could do

[21:16]
hundreds of students so they could do
the same. Through our league finder
stats and pop-ups, you will gain clarity
on your biggest leagues and tendencies,
insights on how your strategies have
been performing in game, and the impact
variance has had on your results. But
knowing your stats is only the

[21:30]
knowing your stats is only the
beginning. In the program, we dig deep
into the root causes behind your leagues
and tendencies and use a proven
sevenstep system to fix them for good
and gain the skills to improve and
continuously evolve. As a poker player,
you'll study more effectively, overcome

[21:46]
you'll study more effectively, overcome
leaks and tendencies that felt
impossible to break, and rebuild trust
and confidence in your game, finally
seeing your hard work pay off as you
move up the stakes. So, if you're ready
to stop guessing and start improving
with clarity, break through the patterns

[22:02]
with clarity, break through the patterns
that have been holding you back, and
take your game to the next level, join
the Mechanics Leakbuster program using
the link down below. And for the first
month of enrollment only, you will get

[22:15]
month of enrollment only, you will get
access to weekly group coaching calls
with me and get a chance to win a
one-on-one coaching session in which I
personally review your game. So don't
miss out on this limited opportunity.
Join the mechanics league buster program

[22:31]
Join the mechanics league buster program
using the link down below and looking
forward to seeing you guys in there. You
describe yourself as someone who
self-confidence and you believe that
with enough effort and study you can get
to the top. What gave you that
confidence? Is it something from your
childhood or has that always been a part

[22:45]
childhood or has that always been a part
of your character traits?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's come from my
childhood. I been a really good student
all of my life like from school also
from my university studies. So I think I
have this um conviction that when I put

[23:03]
have this um conviction that when I put
effort in some things of my life I will
have good results. I also want to thanks
to my family for teaching me that uh

[23:15]
to my family for teaching me that uh
from what I remember my mother and my
father will always be really strict for
me to always study. I had good uh marks
at the school. So
I think my confidence come from there

[23:30]
I think my confidence come from there
because uh I have done a lot of things
in my life where I basically h stud
topic where I
have study a lot or have put out of

[23:45]
have study a lot or have put out of
effort and then I was compensated by
having good results. So I have the
confidence that I could do that the same
with poker. If I just study like um good
Rex do, I will have good results in the
future because I think overall you have

[24:01]
future because I think overall you have
to play good and the state of mind is
really important. But most of the
guys who are just uh crushers is because
they just study more and they are better
players. like there's no

[24:16]
players. like there's no
too many special talents like um I think
poker is kind of as sports in that u
that kind of stuff like if you train
more you probably be getting better so I
think it's quite the same.

[24:30]
think it's quite the same.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it seems like you don't overthink
about things and you have got a high
tolerance for risk. How did you develop
that? Have you always been a bit of a
fearless risk taker or has poker kind of
instilled that in you over time? I think
poker has drilled that into me over
time. Um maybe a bit of it is natural,

[24:47]
time. Um maybe a bit of it is natural,
but yeah. Um actually now I I think I'm
on the nittier side among my MTT friends
in terms of like how how big I play for
my bankroll and and how you know how
hard I fire. So yeah, over time I've

[25:01]
hard I fire. So yeah, over time I've
actually skewed more towards the netty
side. But yeah, when when I was younger
I definitely had that risk-taking
ability. Um maybe maybe too much of it
even. any examples of where it became a
a negative trait where you took on too

[25:15]
a negative trait where you took on too
much risk other than this lo the role?
&gt;&gt; No, I I I think just those two really. I
mean, I've never I've never loved risk
takingaking in like other areas. Like I
don't enjoy, you know, gambling at
casinos or sports betting or anything

[25:30]
casinos or sports betting or anything
like that. Um just in poker, like if I
think I have an edge, I like to try to
push it as far as I can.
&gt;&gt; Why did you choose poker as a career?
what attracted you to the game and all
those early motives to to do. M well I
think

[25:46]
think
I found out kind of a an activity or a
job that where I have this competitive
side of me that I like which is related
to sports but also a job that gives me

[26:03]
to sports but also a job that gives me
the freedom to be able to live a life
that I like. Also in economic terms, if
you do well in poker is not uh is a job

[26:15]
you do well in poker is not uh is a job
that is really well paid compared to
many other uh areas. But also uh I'm
I love
uh being able to organize myself and to
be like the boss of my time, you can

[26:32]
be like the boss of my time, you can
say. So I like poker is a so
it's an a thing that I love too much but
not only because of the game which

[26:45]
not only because of the game which
strategy talking is really interesting
but also because it g you the
opportunity to be able to do many things
at the same time to be able to play with
my friends every day at paddle because I

[27:00]
my friends every day at paddle because I
have the right time to do it because I
can organize myself. So yeah, I think
that all of these kind of stuffs I found
out that poker at everything and it
gives me this uh energy to yeah give a

[27:15]
gives me this uh energy to yeah give a
shout to poker or be alling in poker uh
two years ago. So in college I just
started playing with friends for fun and
then moved over to the apps. Um and what
attracted me was just that I loved the
game and I could make a fair bit of

[27:30]
game and I could make a fair bit of
money doing it. Um, I like the lifestyle
it offered, the freedom and um, you
know, not having to listen to anyone
else. And I actually took an internship
in college and trading um, options
trading and uh, was playing poker at the

[27:47]
trading and uh, was playing poker at the
time and I realized every day at work
I'm just kind of looking forward to come
home to coming home and uh, playing
poker. So that that was a sign to me
like this is what I love to do. So, I'm
just going to do that instead of trying
to force myself into a path that I don't

[28:02]
to force myself into a path that I don't
enjoy as much.
&gt;&gt; What were some of the early signs that
you on the right path? And did you have
any moments of doubt where you thought
this might be a bit for me?
&gt;&gt; Um, early signs that I was on the right
path, I guess, would just be that I was

[28:16]
path, I guess, would just be that I was
having pretty decent success in cash
games. I mean
the apps were very lucrative in the
early days like during co and stuff and
I played a bit on this American site
ignition um and had great results in

[28:30]
ignition um and had great results in
cash there and um I always had a pretty
unique style uh sort of redline focused
style that uh no one else
in my circles had. So they were all sort
of, you know, captivated by by the way I

[28:47]
of, you know, captivated by by the way I
was playing and said like, you know, you
have a really unique style that's
working. You should, you know, keep keep
uh improving this and and see where
it'll where it'll take you.
&gt;&gt; What helps you to stay confident and
maintain your belief, especially when

[29:00]
maintain your belief, especially when
you do have that quite unique aggressive
style, is the moments where you maybe
feel like you're pushing it to extremes.
Yeah, I mean like I said earlier, my
style has insanely high variance. Um,
and so, so what you just said is very

[29:16]
and so, so what you just said is very
important. Uh, for me in tournaments, I
just kind of use my my graph in BB per
100 is sort of my north star to make
sure that I'm on the right track. So,
like when I had my big downswing in
September, I would check that, you know,

[29:32]
September, I would check that, you know,
every week or so to make sure I'm still
having a decent win rate and big blinds
per 100 because in tournaments,
obviously, you can't look at, you know,
results in dollars over any short sample
because it's pretty meaningless. Um, so
I just checked that. Uh, you know, have

[29:47]
I just checked that. Uh, you know, have
better players review my hands, make
sure I'm not doing anything too crazy
and, uh, yeah, just trying to stay the
course regardless of what happens.
&gt;&gt; Quick way to make money is, uh, was, uh,

[30:00]
&gt;&gt; Quick way to make money is, uh, was, uh,
the main motivation. So, and it sucks
because it's uh, not the kind of
motivation which leads to great success
in life. Um, I think I started to really

[30:15]
in life. Um, I think I started to really
laugh and uh appreciate the game quite
later on into my career. maybe like I
hit some sort of an existential crisis
at n 2019 2020

[30:31]
at n 2019 2020
and uh I just had to see it in a
different length l lens not just as a
way to to earn money but like kind of to
see the beauty of the game and stuff
like this. Also, I want to add like uh

[30:47]
like this. Also, I want to add like uh
what attracted what attracted me in the
poker. I just realized besides the
money, it's um I always been attracted
to unconventional stuff and uh I really
enjoy to take like not the mainstream

[31:03]
enjoy to take like not the mainstream
road. So, the poker at that time and at
the place I was was seemed like the most
unconventional I can take.

[31:15]
unconventional I can take.
So I really loved that and also it's
freedom. Um I love that I can construct
my life however I see fit and I don't
have to rely on anyone except

[31:33]
have to rely on anyone except
not increasing rake too much. Yeah, I
guess. Um, so my cousin, he was playing
at a somewhat decent level. Um, not
professionally, but but like at a decent

[31:45]
professionally, but but like at a decent
level. Um, and I I spent a lot of time
with my cousin and so I mean in this in
the start it was just exciting, you
know, playing this game for money and we
were like I was like watching him play
and like he watching was watching me
play and it was just

[32:02]
play and it was just
that was just like very exciting. And
then he helped me a lot in the beginning
and um just made me like understand the
game and we played together played with
friends and so yeah that was just like

[32:15]
friends and so yeah that was just like
the the start and then I like sort of
like figured that like these pros that
makes a lot of money from this game and
there was just like exciting to sort of
like understand that there was people
getting so good at this game that they
could just make a living out of it. That
was just like very exciting to me. Was

[32:31]
was just like very exciting to me. Was
anything that you had challenges with
mindset wise or approach to the game
that caused you frustrations or
difficulties early on?
&gt;&gt; I mean to be honest I I I don't think
I'm that good at taking losses like
compared to some of my friends at least.
So that's that's also why I don't play

[32:45]
So that's that's also why I don't play
higher. Like I could be playing higher
but I just have been experienced that
the the losses negative me like impact
me pretty negatively um compared to
winning you know. So, um, so that
trade-off I haven't been too willing to

[33:00]
trade-off I haven't been too willing to
take a lot of compared to other guys.
Like I have a friend that he's just like
he's taking off way more variance, but
he can also just he can just sort of
like shr off better and and he can sort
of like get into the mindset of like he

[33:15]
of like get into the mindset of like he
just have like points and he's like now
I have less points. Now I have more
points and where for me it's I get a
little bit more like negative attached
to to to the losses. So
&gt;&gt; what is it about losing that impacts
you?
&gt;&gt; Uh I don't know. Um it's probably it's

[33:32]
&gt;&gt; Uh I don't know. Um it's probably it's
probably some resentment kind of thing.
Like I know I should be winning now I'm
losing. I see this guy winning. I I feel
like I'm better than them. And I feel
like that's Yeah. Some kind of like
resentment thing. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What about the the monetary values? You

[33:46]
&gt;&gt; What about the the monetary values? You
mentioned you don't play higher because
you don't want to take the swings like
some of your friends. What's your kind
of risk tolerance and how do you how do
you deal with losing big sums of money
or relatively large amounts? dropping
down in stakes. But I mean that's kind
of the reason why I switched to cash. So

[34:01]
of the reason why I switched to cash. So
the start of my career I only played
entities and um then the last couple of
years I did like switch to cash because
I wanted to get good at cash. So because
I knew I could play and there will be
less variance, right? You you you see
that I had a 500 PB downswing and here

[34:17]
that I had a 500 PB downswing and here
in cash like it's going to be very tough
to have like 50 B down swing, right? So
um for that reason also like the
lifestyle but but yeah so that was
actually the reason why I sort of like
switched to cast like I wanted to be
good at it also I I did enjoy it and I

[34:32]
good at it also I I did enjoy it and I
just you know like the the less variance
and the more free lifestyle of it
&gt;&gt; probably dealing with mistakes I think
is my uh the thing that I um feel more

[34:45]
is my uh the thing that I um feel more
difficult to because uh I'm someone that
I'm really competitive and don't want to
or don't like to make mistakes. Um
because yeah, I have kind of a as I told
you before, I'm really confidence in

[35:03]
you before, I'm really confidence in
myself and probably have
not crazy but big ego of myself which I
consider I'm good. When I make mistakes,
I know that there are people that are

[35:17]
I know that there are people that are
better than me and I don't want them to
know that. I want to feel that I
that I can control the game that I can
control my skills and that I can control
that I will be better than them better

[35:30]
that I will be better than them better
than any opponent. So by making mistakes
you feel that okay this is not happening
maybe my plan of being able to reach 1k
h is not in a good way because they are
not making a stand I am doing so

[35:45]
not making a stand I am doing so
basically this is the thing that I have
to deal better not just in the past but
also in the future because everyone even
David Jones will make some mistakes in a
few sessions so it's just the way you
deal with them and how to approach

[36:01]
deal with them and how to approach
um your next session
that will explain if you are going to
become a better player or not.
&gt;&gt; I'm I think I'm just naturally
optimistic person.
So I was just always like it will work

[36:18]
So I was just always like it will work
out. My mindset kind of was like
whatever. Yeah. I I don't I didn't have
like a huge belief in myself. um just
was I I always was just being a little

[36:33]
was I I always was just being a little
bit more on optimistic side of things.
So I was never scared to take shots
because I always think they will go
well.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean for me whenever I'm going
through a rough patch, my natural

[36:46]
through a rough patch, my natural
instinct or response is to just play
more. Um try to play my way out of it.
Just just keep showing up to work and
and grinding through it. Um, actually
when I'm winning a ton, I want to just
go on vacation and drink a cocktail on a

[37:01]
go on vacation and drink a cocktail on a
beach somewhere and and chill when I'm
when I'm winning a lot. But when I'm
losing, I want to, you know, just show
up and and grind my way out of it.
&gt;&gt; Is there any mindset difference you
notice in playing tournaments compared
playing cash? I know a lot of people
think tournaments are more challenging

[37:16]
think tournaments are more challenging
on the mindset. How have you dealt with
both? Yeah, I mean tournaments the
variance is just exponentially. Like
I don't even know how much higher the
variance is in tournaments compared to
cash, but it's it's huge. I mean live

[37:30]
cash, but it's it's huge. I mean live
tournaments especially, it's like I
played this whole summer at WSOP, maybe
60 bullets, and that's like
one and a half Sundays or something. So,
it's like when two months equate to one
and a half Sundays, you really have to

[37:46]
and a half Sundays, you really have to
keep that in perspective and and zoom
out and realize like this is just a drop
in the bucket. And
you really have to just focus on playing
the next 10 well. Like for me, that's
what it all boils down to. I sit down

[38:00]
what it all boils down to. I sit down
and I think to myself, how can I play
the next 10 well? Because if you get too
caught up in, oh, how did I do this week
or this month or whatever? um you're
really just going to mess yourself up
mentally.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love that. How challenging is
that in practice, especially when maybe

[38:17]
that in practice, especially when maybe
you're on a series, you've got some big
final tables, you just bust out of some
maybe life-changing um big big prizes up
top. How do you then just switch it up
next tournaments back to that that next
hand?
&gt;&gt; It's hard. It It's incredibly hard. Um,

[38:32]
&gt;&gt; It's hard. It It's incredibly hard. Um,
I'm always shocked at guys who will, you
know, bubble a 50k tournament and then
immediately jump into like a $1,500
tournament, you know, 20 minutes later,
no problem. But if you look at the guys

[38:45]
no problem. But if you look at the guys
who do that, they're they're the ones
who are some of the best, you know, like
they're the ones who have the results
over 10 years and who who have had
staying power in the poker world. And
you know, it's it's hard to do in
practice, but like like for me, I've

[39:00]
practice, but like like for me, I've
I've made four WSOP final two tables and
never made a final table. And so like my
whole live poker career has really come
down to like four or five hands. And if
two or three of those go slightly
differently, then, you know, maybe I

[39:15]
differently, then, you know, maybe I
even have a bracelet by now. So, it's
like, you know, you you show up every
day trying to get one of those chances
and then whether or not it goes your way
is out of your control a lot of times,
but it's your job to keep showing up and
and try to get those chances.

[39:30]
and try to get those chances.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's interesting, isn't it, when
you say that your whole life career came
down to four or five hands in terms of
time you got a bracelet and the impact
of that and you can take that two ways.
You can have a negative victim story
around that. If I just ran good in these
hands, all you go right, my job is to

[39:45]
hands, all you go right, my job is to
put myself in more opportunities to uh
go again and to create more chances for
that to happen. Um, yeah, this links in
well actually with your big
breakthrough. I'm guessing it was your
big breakthrough where you had a pretty
crazy Sunday. Can you talk us through
that day back in 2023?

[40:01]
that day back in 2023?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I I think it was in January.
I'd um
I'd been playing MTTS
maybe a few months at this point, but
I'd had one one six figure score before

[40:15]
I'd had one one six figure score before
then. Um but still hadn't really fully
broken out in MTT world. And I ended up
winning on this Sunday, the ACR uh
Sunday High Roller for a bit over
100,000. And then I think the GG high

[40:31]
100,000. And then I think the GG high
roller GG Masters 1050 for like
30,000 maybe 140 something like that. Um
but yeah I won the two Sunday majors in
the same day. Um and just felt like I

[40:47]
the same day. Um and just felt like I
had finally broken through like
I think I doubled my bankroll at that
time. um close to doubled and you know
at that point could play the stakes I
was playing super comfortably and and

[41:01]
was playing super comfortably and and
yeah it just felt felt amazing to get
that break breakthrough.
&gt;&gt; How did that change things cuz I'm
guessing on one side obviously you've
got the bank roll to play higher stakes
but also you've got this kind of god
mode top of the world I can just take
down everything uh to to deal with. So

[41:17]
down everything uh to to deal with. So
how did that impact you going forward?
Do you feel like there was a bit of
recklessness kicked in or was it all
positives in terms of game selection
opportunities?
&gt;&gt; Um, you know, maybe maybe a bit of
winner's tilt, but I think it was mostly
positives. Like I just felt I felt like

[41:32]
positives. Like I just felt I felt like
my decision to play poker was a lot more
validated. Um, you know, it's sort of a
crazy thing to do after college. So, um,
getting that pretty early after I
graduated gave me gave me confidence in

[41:45]
graduated gave me gave me confidence in
what I was doing. gave me confidence
that I had potential to rise rise
towards the top in in the MTT world. Um,
and it it gave me even more motivation
because I wanted to achieve more things
like that um because of how good it

[42:00]
like that um because of how good it
felt. So yeah, I think almost all
positives.
&gt;&gt; Actually, I wanted to actually add one
question. What do you have to do more
and less of when you go play live
compared to online? And what are kind of
the adjustment? Why is it why is it
different? Well, I think the biggest

[42:15]
different? Well, I think the biggest
thing or or one of the biggest
differences between live and online is
the proportion of recreationals in the
pool. Um, online at higher stakes, it's
very rare to to find more than, you
know, one recreational at the table.

[42:30]
know, one recreational at the table.
Compared to live, you know, you you can
have tables where they're where all of
the other players are recreationals. So,
what does that mean? That means that
the skill set you need in live is to try
to extract the maximum, you know, from

[42:47]
to extract the maximum, you know, from
amateur players and and try to
exploit as much as possible. And and
online is a lot more about playing a a
theoretically solid game. I mean, you
still want to deviate a lot against
rags, but they're much the deviations

[43:01]
rags, but they're much the deviations
are much smaller. Um, so yeah, online is
a lot more of a theoretical
solid game for me, whereas live is is a
lot more freestyling.
Um, and then there's obviously the
element of, you know, live reads and,

[43:17]
element of, you know, live reads and,
you know, trying to gain information
about people's hands by looking at them
and paying attention to how they're
acting. So, yeah, I think those are the
two biggest differences for me. If

[44:15]
coaches. So looking forward on educating
you guys over there.
&gt;&gt; Part of everyone everyone's career where
you look back on and you're glad it's
over. But often there's a lot of
valuable lessons to be learned from
those periods. So yourself, talk to us
through like what you learned about
yourself during your biggest down
swings.
&gt;&gt; My biggest down swings. So my my biggest

[44:31]
&gt;&gt; My biggest down swings. So my my biggest
one was when I
played a ticket game at 10K. I jumped
into Remax game with some unknown guy.
So I just thought uh that it's some sort

[44:45]
So I just thought uh that it's some sort
of weak react, but the table didn't fill
up. So as I later on learned it was some
entity player. So I lost like maybe 150k
in couple days in this game and um

[45:02]
in couple days in this game and um
it was a lot at that time and it took me
I think it also coincided with a bitcoin
crash which added kind of another huge

[45:15]
crash which added kind of another huge
amount on top of that. So I think it was
uh the worst uh in terms of manip
[Music]

[45:35]
I think it happened at the same year I
had the best months in my career. what I
learned through this period. Um,

[45:45]
learned through this period. Um,
I had many periods like with a huge
swings because when you play like a low
win rate, you have a
quite a few of those. So throughout meta
era like you just develop

[46:01]
era like you just develop
kind of resilience for the things you
can control and uh what you cannot
control and try to focus on those. I
think what I did, what I was always
doing well is kind of um know when to

[46:18]
doing well is kind of um know when to
move down.
Uh not busting more in a bad state, just
uh stop maybe like uh stop regiring and
uh table select a bit more and things

[46:32]
uh table select a bit more and things
like that.
&gt;&gt; So overall, I I've been pretty fortunate
to be fair with the shots I've taken.
Like I made most of my money now
probably in games that I actually was
shot taking. I have had like down swings

[46:45]
shot taking. I have had like down swings
as well. Thankfully for me when I did
downswing in big games, it was after I'd
already upsw. And so it it hurt a lot
less. Like I I've had um a month where I
retraced 100,000 before where I was

[47:00]
retraced 100,000 before where I was
doing well at like 50 100 and then I
just lose three buyins at 100 200 and
then uh like wipe out most my profits.
So I've had swings like this but to be
fair I've not actually had a downswing
where I just entered the high stakes

[47:17]
where I just entered the high stakes
games and immediately downswing a
significant amount. It was always after
an upswing. What do you do when you
notice that mistakes are getting a
little bit on top of you? What's your
kind of process you go through to to
make them a proactive learning

[47:30]
make them a proactive learning
experience?
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm quite happy you asked that
because h I have poker coach which
helped me a lot with that. He's always
caring about me in this kind of
situations. Overall, he always said me
that to look in a long-term basis like
for example

[47:46]
for example
I play I think more than 1 million hands
in these two years. I'm a winner. You
can see that uh I have positive win
rate. So when you have bad days and when
you just feel you're making a lot of
mistakes and you probably feel kind of

[48:01]
mistakes and you probably feel kind of
uh a bad player, when you take the
overall scope and you see what happened
in this past, you have done a lot of
things good and probably better than
most of the opponents. I think that
gives you again the motivation and the

[48:15]
gives you again the motivation and the
confidence to be able to pass this uh
mental breakdown you have to be able to
in the next session play at least better
than the last day.
&gt;&gt; When did you finally get the belief that
you've got what it takes that you're on
the right path and there's no looking

[48:30]
the right path and there's no looking
back.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I'm not kidding when I say I I
think I had like 45 went so far. My red
line was in China like things were not
looking good for me. And then once I
looked at the NDA material,
um, I had a month 100 and where the

[48:47]
um, I had a month 100 and where the
first month I won like $18,000. So my
net worth like quadrupled. I was back to
where I was before I busted my role. And
I think I won like 90 buyins of Red Line
in that month. So I just had it was such

[49:00]
in that month. So I just had it was such
an immediate shift. It happened very
fast and it just felt like, yeah, things
are going to be better from here. From
there, that initial success or that big
kind of breakthrough month you had, how
did that impact your mindset going
forward? Did you start thinking about

[49:15]
forward? Did you start thinking about
playing higher stakes? Did you start
getting carried away? Was there any kind
of uh negative sides of having success
coming relatively quickly in that short
space there? No, to be honest, I feel
like the experience of going broke was
so so negative for me that it scared me

[49:32]
so so negative for me that it scared me
of ever doing anything again to
risk going broke. So like I've honestly
been a very big bank roll since that
point throughout my career. So had this
very big month at 100 and L. The rake

[49:46]
very big month at 100 and L. The rake
back back then was still very decent on
party poker. I think I was getting like
80%. So I had no incentive to do
anything differently because
I was able to six or nine table and

[50:00]
I was able to six or nine table and
after rake back went like 11 big blinds
per 100. So and this is in the zoom
format. So I was actually making like
close to $150 an hour there without much
variance at all. had no incentive to try
and shot higher because if I moved to

[50:16]
and shot higher because if I moved to
rag tables, I'd have to be playing like
probably a mix of 500 and 1k to get a
similar hourly. So, I just had no
incentive to move up and I yeah, I kept
grinding those games for a good amount
of time.
&gt;&gt; How did you train yourself to play six

[50:31]
&gt;&gt; How did you train yourself to play six
to nine tables? Were you always kind of
a high volume high table player or was
that something you had to learn as you
were at the stakes? No, it's actually
like it's a skill that I trained and I
think that it's maybe it's not an
underrated skill anymore because I think

[50:47]
underrated skill anymore because I think
rakeback grinding is somewhat dead now.
I don't really see where that exists.
But so I went from being a two zoom
tables player. That was my base. And
then when I moved over to party and I

[51:01]
then when I moved over to party and I
saw they had these leaderboards and this
rake back where if you nine table for 12
hours in a day, you can get 150 to 100%
rake back. So I remember what I did at
the time to get good at playing more
tables was I immediately started playing

[51:17]
tables was I immediately started playing
six zoom tables and then six wreck
tables at a time. And I think I was this
is at 50 and L. I was losing at like 10
big blinds per 100 doing this. But then
the rakeback was like eight big blinds,

[51:30]
the rakeback was like eight big blinds,
so it wasn't really much. And I just
kept doing it. And then after a week, I
think I got down to like minus six,
which was probably even winning after
rake back with the structure they had
back then. And then I kept doing it and
I managed to get it down to like minus 4

[51:45]
I managed to get it down to like minus 4
and then I shot 100 FF and I had um
minus two big blinds for like 150,000
hands there, which is winning a lot
after rakeback.
And once they cut leaderboards and I
went to playing other sites, there

[52:00]
went to playing other sites, there
wasn't really this incentive to play so
many tables. But what I found was
because I had played so many tables
before when I went to four tableabling
zoom or like six tableling rectables
after it felt so much easier than it did

[52:16]
after it felt so much easier than it did
before like or compared to nine
tableabling. So, I feel like by actually
just playing an absurd amount of hands
per hour, it made playing like still
pretty reasonable volume, it made it
feel quite easy actually comparatively.

[52:30]
feel quite easy actually comparatively.
&gt;&gt; Do you think it's a skill anyone can
train? Do you feel like your starting
points if other players try to replicate
that kind of playing these kind of 12
tables, struggling to keep up, but then
over time kind of speed getting their
mind to speed up with decision- making?
Do you feel like it's a process a lot of

[52:45]
Do you feel like it's a process a lot of
players could go through? And you feel
like there's even without as many
leaderboard chases or right back deals,
do you feel like it's still a a useful
skill for players to invest in?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I think this is where like I I
do have a strong opinion on it and I
know it's contrary to like what a lot of

[53:00]
know it's contrary to like what a lot of
people will say and I don't really know
what the right answer is. I can only say
what I think on the matter. I think it's
definitely like less important to want
to play crazy volume now that the rake
back just isn't there and you don't need
to like rake a certain threshold to get

[53:16]
to like rake a certain threshold to get
the good rake back. So, it's definitely
true that there's less incentive. But at
the same time, I do think that everyone
should be able to play like I I would
honestly say at least six tables at once
cuz otherwise I think long term you are

[53:32]
cuz otherwise I think long term you are
just going to miss Eevee if you're not
comfortable doing that. it. I think it
gets different at the higher end. Like
if you're just playing 2K now and
higher, maybe you just want to pay more
attention to spots against better
opponents. But I think it's a skill that

[53:46]
opponents. But I think it's a skill that
yes, I think probably anyone could learn
it if they put in the time. For example,
um a friend of mine who used to break by
grind these leaderboards,
he used to CFP some students and what he
said he would make them do the first

[54:01]
said he would make them do the first
month they joined with him was he would
make them play 300,000 hands in a month
as like a requirement because then
afterwards that he would say you can
just play 50 100,000 hands a month and
they would find it really easy to do

[54:15]
they would find it really easy to do
because they played so many hands the
first month which is obviously an
extreme
It's an extreme way of doing it, but I
understand the logic and you know, I
think the skill is still valuable. I
think it's still valuable to be able to
play more tables. Definitely. I also see

[54:31]
play more tables. Definitely. I also see
actually a lot of value in if you
actually it's a very good idea actually
like because if you do that, if you tell
them to play 300k hands, you will also
and if you would then analyze the data,
you will see like the worst of their
game probably like their C game. So, and

[54:45]
game probably like their C game. So, and
this is where you usually just want to
start. Okay, let's solidify what's
what's really bad. And I think if you
play this many tables, you know what
comes out is just your natural lens
through which you see the game. All your
biases will be shown in your stats. So
you can you see immediately the root

[55:02]
you can you see immediately the root
cause of any future problem will
probably come from this data that you
now collected. So I think not only
indeed does it make future volume
easier, it's like training with extra
weight, right? And then when when the

[55:15]
weight, right? And then when when the
match is there, you take off the weight,
it's like feel very light. It's very
easy. But like I said, I think for
gathering data on what's probably the
root cause of any future problem that
you will have, right? Because it shows
your natural bias. I think it's very uh
any coach listening, I think, is going

[55:30]
any coach listening, I think, is going
to is going to do something with this
information for sure.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like it. I agree as well. I feel
like for the most part there's a lot of
positives from putting yourself in that
high stress situation to uh get used to
playing more table tables more hands and
then when you scale it down it feels a
lot less and like Rene was saying that a

[55:45]
lot less and like Rene was saying that a
lot of things will come up in that
sample. One of the push backs could be
you could ingrain a lot of bad habits in
three thou 3,000 hands 3,000 hands that
you need to then work on undoing. Uh but
yeah overall it feels like the ability
to turn it on. I feel like that's that's
often underrated. the ability to play

[56:00]
often underrated. the ability to play
more tables if you need to, to play more
volume if you need to, because there's
spots in poker where it just makes sense
to go beast mode and to be able to not
cap yourself on tables and volume. So,
if you trained that skill set, you're
going to be in a good position. For you
personally, do you feel like you had any

[56:16]
personally, do you feel like you had any
uh maybe slowing down your growth by
going for the the rakeback approach?
enough myself. I did similar elite for
three years in a row and there was a few
years at least the last year and a half
where I was probably slow myself down
from going to the higher stakes from
playing so much volume because couldn't
study enough and I was just yeah chasing

[56:31]
study enough and I was just yeah chasing
right back basically. Do you feel like
it maybe slowed you down anyways or
there was any negatives from going from
the high volume approach?
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. Th this is an interesting
topic and I've thought quite a bit about
it. I would say no for me personally.

[56:45]
it. I would say no for me personally.
And the reason is because I think that
the thing that actually stops people
from playing high stakes it I think
there's two things. Part of it is
obviously going to be your ability as a
player, how well you perform. It's
always going to be a very important

[57:01]
always going to be a very important
aspect, but I personally think that once
you reach a threshold of how good you
are as a player,
it's going to be bankroll that's
actually stopping you from playing
higher. Like the best games I've ever
ever played in my life have been at

[57:16]
ever played in my life have been at
20,000 NL, like softer than 10L games
that I've played. And I think that like
people not being able to play those
games, it's not an issue of skill, it's
just an issue of bankroll. And so I
think that what people often neglect,
especially guys that maybe they're years

[57:32]
especially guys that maybe they're years
into playing poker and they don't
actually have a bank roll that's bigger
than like 150, 200,000. I think they're
focusing too much attention on playing
solid, playing good, playing less

[57:45]
solid, playing good, playing less
volume, and not actually just building
money to be able to play in games where
the rake is lower, where it's a really
good spot where if they're just playing
good against the recreational, you know,
even if they're losing a bit to to the
other regs, it's not enough to not make

[58:00]
other regs, it's not enough to not make
them very profitable in those spots. So,
I definitely think it's a neglected a
neglected aspect, for sure. Yeah, it's
very interesting like almost like
bankroll is an opportunity to play
bigger games. I think also from a
mindset perspective having a large

[58:15]
mindset perspective having a large
bankroll but the games you're playing
puts you at so much ease the swings you
can deal with so much better when you're
not like worried about how many buys
you've lost relative to your role. You
mentioned like some of your most best
games playing 20k. It got me thinking
how you handle the risk when you're play
make those big shots at those higher

[58:30]
make those big shots at those higher
buyins. Yes, you've got the role for it
but a few buying swings at those stakes
could make or break your year basically.
So, how do you deal with one taking on
those opportunities and then if they
don't go well, how do you kind of
recalibrate your expectations?
&gt;&gt; So, if I'm going to take a big shot,

[58:46]
&gt;&gt; So, if I'm going to take a big shot,
which I've done a few times um in the
last only year to be honest, because I
made the transition from just playing
mistakes to actually trying to play
higher around September of last year.

[59:01]
higher around September of last year.
I would say that I the the thought
process behind taking a shot for me is
always what do I actually think my win
rate would be at that table and if it's
double digits then I and the shot isn't
going to affect the games I have to play

[59:16]
going to affect the games I have to play
on a regular basis then I'm I always
decided to just take the shot because I
felt like the opportunity cost of not
taking the spot when it shows is too
much and I would always do it in a
controlled way as well. So, for example,

[59:30]
controlled way as well. So, for example,
um on ACR, there are some like really
really insane spots at high stakes.
There's kind of a weird format. It's
called no rattle where um you buy in for
10 big blinds. So, there was for
example, one table is 200 400, but you

[59:48]
example, one table is 200 400, but you
only buy in for 10 big blinds. And there
was a recreational there. I I don't know
how much he lost. He probably lost close
to $80,000 that session. And so I viewed

[1:00:00]
to $80,000 that session. And so I viewed
it as like, okay,
I'm buying in for 10 big blinds is
$8,000 realistically. Oh, sorry, it's
$4,000. If I lose here, like, you know,
20, 30k, it's actually not going to
affect me being able to play the games I
would usually play anyways. Yes, it

[1:00:17]
would usually play anyways. Yes, it
might mean that I'm not going to be
making money for the next few months
because I'm reg grinding my losses, but
if the shot goes well, then, you know, I
can take another shot at a good high
stakes game if it appears. So, for me, I

[1:00:31]
stakes game if it appears. So, for me, I
just always feed up the risk to reward
and how much losing would actually
affect my lifestyle or my mindset. And
if it felt worth taking the shot, I
would take it.
&gt;&gt; How did you end up being this high
volume guy? because I know some people

[1:00:45]
volume guy? because I know some people
struggle with volume and they will never
be a high volume person and other
players can either choose either to be a
high volume player or play more quality.
So for you, how did you end up becoming
this kind of similar grinder?
&gt;&gt; I think it was just a natural thing for

[1:01:00]
&gt;&gt; I think it was just a natural thing for
me to do. I kind of u
like this uh I liked this like um
highpaced environment of playing many
tables like a constant constant action

[1:01:15]
tables like a constant constant action
but uh I didn't I never played a lot of
hours like even when I was a supernova
elite uh I played uh
120 hours on average during the months
maybe even less.

[1:01:31]
maybe even less.
It's just because um at 24 tables at uh
400 600 stakes you can do it
you don't have to push that much. I
wouldn't say what was kind of the

[1:01:46]
wouldn't say what was kind of the
grinder who puts like a lot of hours
just uh had an ability to execute a
somewhat decent strategy at uh a lot of
tables. But I always played with u I

[1:02:01]
tables. But I always played with u I
sacrificed a lot of win rate
for this. During this time I was break
even and uh even after that I never
played with high win rate. I think uh my
best five year stretch it was like 4B

[1:02:17]
best five year stretch it was like 4B
win rate. So Neil was a crusher. I think
it's just some cap on myself as well.
some sort of mindset I had developed
about myself. If you want to focus more

[1:02:30]
about myself. If you want to focus more
while playing, let me tell you guys
about Brain FM. This is actually
something I stumbled on prior to the
World Championship and it's been what
I've been listening to for hours and
hours straight while playing. It's music
specifically designed to help you focus.
Personally, I have ADHD. They have a

[1:02:46]
Personally, I have ADHD. They have a
special function where they play sound
that interacts very well with your brain
waves, helping you to focus. And it's
been something that I've been listening
to and using for doing work or playing
poker and it has definitely changed my

[1:03:00]
poker and it has definitely changed my
focus and helped my game. So I wanted to
inform you guys on this opportunity link
down below one free month trial and uh
yeah let me know how you like it.
actually um a guy like a reg Nimrod he

[1:03:15]
actually um a guy like a reg Nimrod he
sent me a YouTube video of um some
it's called like free 3pm study with me
where it's like rain sounds and thing
and he said he got it from you. I've
been doing it a lot ever since and it
has helped a lot uh for me as well. Um,

[1:03:31]
has helped a lot uh for me as well. Um,
it really can get you get you in the
zone. And also this thing here, like I
put it on and I just know for the next 3
hours I'm I'm locked in like I know now.
And that's like 3 hours is kind of like
a nice time, you know, where you just
know like now it's it's time to go. Do

[1:03:47]
know like now it's it's time to go. Do
&gt;&gt; you look at how you approach poker back
then when you started compared to how
you approach it now? What are the main
ships that stand out? I guess just the
importance of having something else than
poker in in your life. Like poker just

[1:04:01]
poker in in your life. Like poker just
cannot be the only thing that you're
doing because when poker goes badly,
your life goes badly. So having
something else, um I feel like I've been
pretty good at that in um I live here in
in Denmark and I feel like if I went to

[1:04:16]
in Denmark and I feel like if I went to
like another country that would be
better for my career, I feel like it
would
it would I would probably be too
attached to just poker, right? But here
I have a lot of non-poker friends and I

[1:04:31]
I have a lot of non-poker friends and I
see them a lot and I sort of can attach
myself a lot to from playing poker to
just like being with my friends and
having fun with them. So yeah, just um
don't take it too serious and don't
attach yourself too much to it.

[1:04:45]
attach yourself too much to it.
&gt;&gt; You said you don't get much fulfillment
out of poker these days. What does give
you fulfillment?
&gt;&gt; Um it's a good question. I guess what
gives me fulfillment is if I feel like
I'm working towards things that are
important to me long term. So like I
have a good relationship with my

[1:05:01]
have a good relationship with my
girlfriend.
The prospect of being able to build a
family one day is fulfills me. Even if
I'm not doing it right now, if I feel
like I'm making decisions that kind of
put me further towards my long-term

[1:05:15]
put me further towards my long-term
goals, that's fulfilling to me.
&gt;&gt; Why do you feel like poker doesn't quite
do that at the moment for you
&gt;&gt; after a certain point? It's like if you
know or you feel confident that you have
a win rate in certain games or against
very good players,
there's not really this

[1:05:31]
there's not really this
element of wanting to improve to be able
to beat certain people. I'm not saying
I'm like the best in the world or I
don't think I'm close, but I think I'm
good enough to like beat the games I
want to beat and I I've achieved the
things I wanted to achieve. And so it's

[1:05:45]
things I wanted to achieve. And so it's
like past that point, it's just playing
to make money. And it kind of becomes
it kind of becomes repetitive and dull
if that's the only thing, which is fine
like cuz it's a good living and it still

[1:06:00]
like cuz it's a good living and it still
has its moments of of creativity and
whatnot, but it definitely becomes this
thing where it's like you pour all this
time into it to make money. Like, yes,
it's good, but why would like why would
I feel um ambitious about doing that
more? It just kind of seems empty to me.

[1:06:17]
more? It just kind of seems empty to me.
&gt;&gt; What are the biggest things still left
for you to achieve? What's the highest
things that you you look towards at the
start of a year that you still set?
&gt;&gt; Well, I need to win a live tournament.
Um I still I I've won like a $200 live

[1:06:30]
Um I still I I've won like a $200 live
tournament or something, but I don't
count that. Um I want to win a, you
know, significant live tournament,
preferably at WSOP. I've always wanted a
bracelet. Um,
so yeah, I think that's the biggest
thing. And then also I I would say to

[1:06:45]
thing. And then also I I would say to
play play some Triton series one day
would be one of my goals. Um, I've
considered it, but I I don't think it
makes that much sense for me right now
where I'm at um bankroll wise and yeah,
I I've always been a big fan of keeping

[1:07:00]
I I've always been a big fan of keeping
all my own action um you know, as much
as possible. So,
&gt;&gt; why do you feel like you want or need
one of those big live wins? Is it to uh
kind of validate the work you've put in,
or is it just a competitive drive to to
want to get that next thing?
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, live to me feels almost

[1:07:16]
&gt;&gt; Well, I mean, live to me feels almost
like a different game than online. Um, I
mean, they're both poker, but the skill
sets required are much different. So, I
I sort of just want to prove myself in
both arenas. Um,
yeah, and and show people that I'm not

[1:07:30]
yeah, and and show people that I'm not
just an online player. As you mentioned,
there's so much variance live and it
comes down to a certain amount of hands.
How would you feel if the score never
came, the big score live?
&gt;&gt; Sad. I mean, yeah, I mean, definitely
would be disappointed if I if I never

[1:07:45]
would be disappointed if I if I never
got it, but you know, that's a very real
possibility. Um, I don't know how much
how much longer I'd be playing live. So,
like, you know, if I play four or five
more WSOPs and just break everything,
maybe I find something else to do. Um,

[1:08:03]
maybe I find something else to do. Um,
so yeah, it's definitely a very real
possibility. But, you know, you you show
up every day just hoping hoping if you
play your best, you'll get that chance
one day.
&gt;&gt; What's your definition of success today?
And how's that evolved over the years?

[1:08:16]
And how's that evolved over the years?
For me, success is just having a life
where I get to do things I enjoy and be
around people I want to be around. And
then also like having success inside of
a professional endeavor is of course
important I think and I wouldn't want to

[1:08:31]
important I think and I wouldn't want to
lose that. But to me now it's more about
trying to
I guess strike a bit of a better balance
and maybe focus more on things that I
was neglecting a lot over the last few
years just because I was so focused on

[1:08:45]
years just because I was so focused on
playing a lot of poker every day. I
think success is something related to
happiness. I think some sex is really
really person dependent. I would say for
you being successful means one thing for

[1:09:00]
you being successful means one thing for
me will be another thing. the feeling
that you have inside of you that you are
happy about something you have put
effort on and that you have achieved one
goal for example um I think I'm really
happy of how I did in the challenge even

[1:09:17]
happy of how I did in the challenge even
though I made so many mistakes and there
are a lot of things I would have changed
but because I feel I gave everything and
it's something that for me is a success
even though the results probably uh

[1:09:30]
even though the results probably uh
could be better could be worse for sure.
But for me it was a success because I
have this um feeling in my mind or
feeling inside of me that I put all the
effort I could and I did
mostly the the best I could do during

[1:09:47]
mostly the the best I could do during
that time because of course I could have
done better but I was think I will think
and I will guess that my future two
years will say the same for me right
now. So I think this is success for me.

[1:10:01]
now. So I think this is success for me.
&gt;&gt; I do try to to work hard. So I try to
put in effort to study and work hard and
just kind of focus on that and sort of

[1:10:15]
just kind of focus on that and sort of
like create a life for myself where
I can do kind of what I want to do and
also having like a good life then I
guess I haven't thought too much about
it though what success mean but like

[1:10:31]
it though what success mean but like
sort of like being fulfilled like I have
to I know with myself that I have to put
in effort and I have to sort of keep
going uphill otherwise if I stagnate I
will be super depressed. So um yeah I I

[1:10:45]
will be super depressed. So um yeah I I
have to work hard to sort of like feel
like I'm successful in some some way.
&gt;&gt; You have to almost earn that feeling. So
for you let's say you do stagnate. Let's
say you have a period where you don't
feel like you're working hard. How is
that kind of depressed feeling manifest
for you?
&gt;&gt; Just the feeling of stagnation or or

[1:11:00]
&gt;&gt; Just the feeling of stagnation or or
like declining is just um I don't know.
It's just uh it always makes me like
super super depressed like I have to s
sort of like do do something you know do
something with my life otherwise it's
just um it's a bad feeling uh for sure.

[1:11:15]
just um it's a bad feeling uh for sure.
It's almost this um scary imagination of
yourself being let's say 45 50 years old
with nothing going for you like not
wealthy not not like having anything
just like that's like a very scary

[1:11:31]
just like that's like a very scary
feeling for me you know so I sort of
like I I need to sort of um prevent that
from happening. Well, in poker it's sort
of hard to define success. So for me, I
guess it's just feeling at the end of

[1:11:45]
guess it's just feeling at the end of
the day like like I, you know, reached
my potential in terms of how well I can
play, h how how many days I can play my
best. Um, you know, you'll always have
bad days, but for me,

[1:12:01]
bad days, but for me,
it's something you can control
for the most part. So, you know, if I'm
having a stretch where I'm just playing
like my C game every other day, um
that's when I don't feel successful.
That's when I feel like I have a lot of

[1:12:15]
That's when I feel like I have a lot of
things to improve. But if I show up
every day and I feel like I'm playing as
well as I can, I feel successful
regardless of if the results are coming
or they're not. Um for me, the results,
you know, they are what they are.
they're sort of disconnected from, you

[1:12:32]
they're sort of disconnected from, you
know, how how how well you're playing at
the time.
&gt;&gt; Uh it's changed quite a lot. Uh before
the definition of success for me, for
example, would be to play the high

[1:12:45]
example, would be to play the high
stakes if we're talking about cash
games. And uh now I think the definition
of success for me is to be
happy with where you are. you just uh
need to to decide for yourself where you

[1:13:01]
need to to decide for yourself where you
want to be but it and it's like always
your personal choice. There is no
meaning in life. So like you can put
whatever meaning into it. If it's like

[1:13:15]
whatever meaning into it. If it's like
playing cash games at 1K 2K like so be
it. You can find meaning into that. Like
it's whatever. So
yeah for me success is to be
happy about myself uh being proud about

[1:13:30]
happy about myself uh being proud about
myself and uh the things which makes me
proud of myself it's like kind of it's
the stuff is the stuff I am
I am deciding for myself like the amount

[1:13:45]
I am deciding for myself like the amount
of work I want to put in or like uh
the amount the level of uh mastery of
excellence uh I want to have in the game
like I I I like I kind of have my own

[1:14:01]
like I I I like I kind of have my own
ideas and yeah so self-satisfaction
&gt;&gt; coming up in the next episode
&gt;&gt; I think there's a misconception on how
much variance there is in live poker
cash games I think people underestimate
that so much

[1:14:15]
that so much
&gt;&gt; I know I understand the variance and I
know that it doesn't matter what you do
in a day
&gt;&gt; that was that was like actually a a very
good good advice because I feel like a
lot of poker players really need that.
&gt;&gt; It really made my life more enjoyable.
&gt;&gt; I have just been way too much of a

[1:14:30]
&gt;&gt; I have just been way too much of a
calling station. I think it comes from
projection
&gt;&gt; and he's probably just playing the spot
way better because the EV difference
between P50, B75 or whatever is just,
you know, nothing right.
&gt;&gt; In my mind, there is no difference
between GTO play and exploitative play

[1:14:45]
between GTO play and exploitative play
because uh exploit is a GTO with no
locks. So, it's kind of the same thing.
