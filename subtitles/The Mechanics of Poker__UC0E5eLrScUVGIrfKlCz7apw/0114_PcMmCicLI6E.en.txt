he falls for it in the end
in the end you know they do fall for it
you just keep on trapping in the end
they do fall for it

the launch is finally there our poker
ambition academy is now live with our
more advanced products like the
mechanics of poker and monster classes
we were aiming for the mid to high
stakes players well i'm very much aware
that the majority of you are going to be
playing a little bit lower stakes and
for that we have now provided the poker
ambition academy go over to our
sitepokermission.com to find out more
what's up guys
welcome
flop quads straight away we have the
seven dudes seven dudes never lose
but let's hope uh white out to be uh
what's gonna say putin some raises
and he decides to go go for a barrel
this is also considered very bad timing
by all means do do it
all in pocket sevens
the stream good luck
maybe a little bluffy bluffy
nine extra space or something
a seven
but probably just a cooler probably just
a cooler
oh a little bluffy bluff with the seven
eight
i was already like hmm maybe we should
not bet the river all too big
that's it it was a very very incredibly
strong and aggressive play okay
give it to me baby
what the [ __ ]
well we flop [ __ ] trips [ __ ] trips
ever heard of pocket trips
it's a pocket trip
scythe play is slow
usually i just play my
my lower trips
in a slow way here
the same for the turn
this part where we can have big bets and
small bats but for this game
chose his cards in a mug unfortunately
for us
a little half bot bet here that's
interesting say from all the strategies
you could choose and all the sizes you
could choose probably half bot is the
least preferred i would say
kind of recall
but hey i mean it's not necessarily
bad
i think probably the least bird
and this river probably gonna check
again
see you thanks again good luck for the
session for the people who didn't follow
positive poker seven douche yet go give
the guy a follow we face a patrick beth
i think i'm just gonna fold a bit of a
funky line
kind of depends
what he does
ah good queens
don't mind if i do don't mind if i
that's a good flop
all right we'll take that one
thank you very much runs it once why not
that's what you get man for running at
once maybe if you would have run it
twice
i love it when people run at once
you know when they
when they lose personally
it is small
okay this is actually a reason why
people usually don't like it let's try a
little true
that's actually why people usually don't
like it but i'm a guy who doesn't really
need a lot maybe it's also based on my
life that i'm here they just dropped
five that's good
life is good
uh are we gonna bet
probably 50 50.
then he turns king 10 and then we have
five and then we do
happy dance oh no i jinxed it i jigs
i know where this goes i should really
stop drinking
yeah then we're actually already quite
far like i said it's small
but i don't mind that it has
quite a lot of foreign is actually also
living there so in terms of social life
there is quite a lot of expats and stuff
like that
so i like the social community here
shopping sets
popping sets and not caring that's how
we roll
pocket aces
oh this is close
i think i'll check
here we better the three so i'll keep
you updated
oh then
it was quite close if i should maybe
something here on the turn
um
please check what is the nice i'm gonna
fold
here
oh actually
i saw that right in time
i'm not really sure i think he's going
to slow down quite a lot down that part
here at h5
so it didn't really matter what we would
do
here
obviously we have a damn now
all right guys we need a bit more luck
go
i am lucky
i am skillful and i will win you gotta
feel it
not there yet but getting close
you think he's gonna you think he's
gonna pull the same trick
i'm gonna get a deja vu
actually i should have really caught
that knight actually because it wasn't
big blind button
or was it
oh wait it wasn't cut off big blind i
think it was a small line then i shoot
it
i'll just falling
finish close
but i would assume we're gonna just try
again
i think we have a fault especially with
the club
i think and like eights nines are
probably gonna continue
but not sixes not fives
and if we continue success it's probably
without
without a club because we want him to
have
basically if we have a club it lowers
his bluffing frequency pay attention
guys we are giving away over 10k dollar
worth of free prizes in our poker
ambition academy including a free
license to our mechanics of poker
program
so what are you waiting for join our
weekly interactive webinars at the poker
ambition academy
like a little and juicy juicy okay
that's what they call an uh
induction sizing
sorry
i cannot find my [ __ ] clip
ah it seems to be an induction size
where wouldn't that work against berkey
fall for this with
one pair of typing would have worked
against berkey
hey you just had ace queen
under the cooled four bed action
going on here
he's going to rip it in and not have
aces
that's
our rule
like i said rip it in doesn't have aces
however
he beats an ace
are you kidding me
how does he bank an ace
son i would tell you this much son i
would never have put more 3 000 with two
tons well here we go idiot players call
races with queen ten they don't even
know how to spell poker i mean
and he makes fine value that
probably would not have hold it
if it would have better so
what happened here
probably gonna start off with a check
with the ace
ace club's ace hard would be the best
example of a check but i think this is
probably also okay
i called formatted he called
he falls for it in the end
in the end you know they do fall for it
you just keep on trapping in the end
they do fall for it
oh
it's
a [ __ ] joke it's a [ __ ] joke
the trapper got trapped
you have to be joking i mean
and trying not to be negative but god
damn [ __ ] [ __ ]
okay yeah so apparently apparently you
guys missed it all
okay
tune in too late
for the first question

[Music]
ring adam has
one free webinar one free webinar for
adam shout out to adam
send me your email here on twitch you
can send messages whiteotb went little
funky on me we loved quads that's how we
do it
you check raises 7 8 which you know
preflop
i have to say versus 2.5 is already very
out of line
flop check race without a spade it's
also a little bit outlined but okay you
can do it
okay seven six a bit more often than
seven eight but okay
turn back i would say it's also out of
line especially for this sizing
and then the river the czech race is
also a little out of line but hey when
you have quads it doesn't really matter
that people are out of line you win a
lot of money
yeah
so
i'm just waiting now to find a score
