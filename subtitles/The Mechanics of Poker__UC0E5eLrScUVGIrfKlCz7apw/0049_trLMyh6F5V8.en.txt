huh
we actually still win hi hey
how did he not bluff that river with
king queen no spade and a club
how did he upload that river
[Music]
do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo yes yes
yes yes yes yes the party started
i'm gonna exaggerate it i'm gonna
exaggerate it today wait
let me actually make a note i will add
it here to my noteblock
hmm interesting get three bet hmm
i call hmm interesting flop
hmm maybe i should make a little donkey
donkey hmm
yes i'm gonna make a little donkey
donkey
hmm i think this hand is a check hmm
masterdoc had some very nice things that
he said about you on his tuesday stream
well okay now if michael perry says it i
i believe it oh it is actually
interesting river
i'm gonna go for that the czech results
as we have an ace let's say for example
i had a set i would just go for a very
bad
big bet but since now we have an ace i
think we should
just check raise how big should we check
raise wacko
when you have a good head guys let me
explain you something
if you have a very good hand you should
bet
very big okay this is not pot limit
something this is no limit holding where
you can just
check rizzles your second
hmm arbor hmm
yeah he's going to call guys
he's going to call he knows it
he doesn't want to but he's going to
[Music]
hey faults
first check check results of the stream
guys
i went to a seminar once uh like one of
these uh
self-improvement type of seminars and
the guy opened open they opened his uh
his story i thought it was quite funny
that he went to a um what do you call
one of these things
a monastery or something you know where
the buddhists are where the monks are
etc
in somewhere very far away and he came
there
and then then the monk said him you only
one problem
so then he thought okay it's good i only
have one problem
and then the guy said you problem ah
i thought it was funny okay
so what is in our way that's why i said
only you are in your way
uh and for bet this hand
i am going to i'm too for bet this hand
so snap
snappity snap snap snap snappity snap
snap snap
make a little seabed this board should
not really improve in that much
oh this turn is actually quite
interesting
close the board i had a flush dry i
would definitely jam the terminals at 10
i would definitely not jam
close close oh we call this three bit
here with the packet
not the greatest off boards
probably have to call one but not very
happy about it i guess lower pairs here
just perform bad
like sometimes you have these spots
where you want to call fours and fives
and not eights and nines i don't think
this is really a spot like that
so sometimes you also have
that you want to then play the ones with
the spade but in this case it also
doesn't really matter because the board
is paired
fill in barrels
yeah basically now we don't want to have
a spade and we also don't really want to
have a heart
these kind of spots already are already
are really close i'm just gonna call one
more but
in a perfect world you would only call
eight of diamonds
or probably actually maybe only nine
type of holdings
then checks
i don't mind getting the stack in now
when the flash completed the flash
wouldn't have completed obviously i
would just check
but i think now we're at the very very
bottom of our range
actually maybe we can but like for
example if you have king queen or
something queen of hearts that would
kind of be i guess our other bottom in
these positions
would we really want to jam the river
i don't really think so actually i think
aids is probably a better bluff
even though that maybe sounds a little
bit weird if
i would be playing button versus small
light i would definitely
not do this
take a little over bet
uh
i'm gonna check this one ah
and i won i figured maybe like sometimes
a chop
a chop uh we actually won 10 8.
unbelievable everybody here with the ace
yes king
ah [ __ ] it guys i'm in a good mood let's
try a little through with the seven
deuce no
no bats anymore going but just because
we can
oh that's also what lex fought okay lexi
i'm sorry i'm sorry we have a z
bucket kings hmm
i agree hmm it's very hard
[Music]
shout out to this is eric where's eric
from
shout out to the polish community
to be honest with this hand we don't
really have much of a decision so we're
just going to keep on betting
and we leave the hmm up to mrs eric
oh when they type and do something
that's why you have to worry
that when you have to watch out decision
here oh if you now jams i feel so [ __ ]
i cannot fault but i'm not very happy
timing chatting and jamming if that
ain't the nuts
okay it calls interesting and the river
always the guy i love good good luck
[Music]
if zarik has it then good for zarek
derek snapfold good for sarah good
decisions eric
shout out to zarik and let's throw out a
little seven news guys i'm in the super
super good mood
i just show them drunken style and i
think it's good for poker like bring
some fun enjoyment
the glasses i'm wearing today are pink
glasses where you see opportunities
everywhere you think it's because of the
hmm
interesting or a little lamborghini here
with the six seven suit
get a call see bet
going to be barreling
and villain folds we got this guy
crushed
so basically what happened was he check
raced there's a small bet and i ripped
it in
we hadn't dominated do you also attack
players as recreational when they don't
have auto rebuy on or does this not have
to mean that they are recreational
and usually if i don't really know
someone and he's also not reloading at
it you know one plus one is uh
three get three bet here
go for the four bet we're gonna go for
the check
clubs everywhere
he decides to stab we're going it's king
getting it in
let's go my friend tell me what you have
that's a classic flip
one time come on no
i only run at once [ __ ] finish man
the finish finish run at once hey man
you went
you won that part let me just win this
one a small one
but you know ooh interesting river
snap check behind here we got another
very small three bed was it the same guy
who's gonna let us realize some equity
that improves the two pair
let's see if that was the same guy he
bets again well we're definitely still
in
bad river
was that the same yeah aces one time
no no we were completely crushed all the
[ __ ] way
this hands
this hand i'll put in this sizing
oh interesting river
a little bit small again and snipperty
snippety snoopy snopping you snoopity
calling erase
he calls with a
deuce thank you very much
sir
[Music]
he's going for the bat
make a nice little raisey raisin
crazy daisy
raise it up
raise it up billy goals
and mux and he has queen six
[Applause]
suitors
[Music]
here sorry that it bets out
like a little race here i think
so actually the same guy again
turn is quite close all right this is a
little bit too good
yeah that's that sometimes happens guys
your head's a little bit too good
got me convinced my friend this is a
little forex
i'm gonna make a little cali cali cali
cali cali
okay flop
decent candidate for a check raise with
some backup equity with the king of
parts i'm gonna do it 50 of the time
54 guys with a license to check rates
they say somewhere between these two
sizings like
10.50 i think is fair
make a little barrel barrel
i haven't thought
billion falls like a little chicken
[Music]
like a little chicken he folds [ __ ]
dates here
pays a half pot ishiba
so far ok situation
interesting turn
checks
oh
why did he check back the turn with ace
queen
why did he check back the turn with ace
queen
i figured
he was going to have
quite a lot of
quite a lot of jacks
queens kings all right
they're like some 9x river maybe some
10x like king 10 suited queen 10 suited
yeah a smarter sounding explanation but
sometimes guys sometimes you i think
it's just time to ship it in and go to
bed
sometimes you just gotta gotta gotta
gotta gotta it's just time to ship it in
and go to bed
ship it and go to bed that's right
looking to get it inverse this guy
he has been doing that quite often
he's not interested this time
maximum overdrive any boris bratcha fans
in the house
for the for the music lovers here we
almost have a straight flush but a flush
will do
here we have an open and there i said
yes
one of these weird ones so i call
here we're still we're still in the race
we're still in a race for the straight
flush let's see if we get there
would be so nice a seven hearts on the
river that would be the ultimate revenge
flush of a flush in my advantage now
straight flush over straight flush here
we don't have a heart so we full
come on seven of hearts on the river he
has five four of hearts poker stars
be fair here my friend
like a little over bed here
open a little seven dudes here on the
bottom because we scrazy
okay i'm gonna go
with a little seabed
a little bit tempted to go for a little
over bet that's what i'm gonna do
am i really yes i am
one time win
[Music]
i'm making also a little check raise
every day screen we raised fitting
through that very
low frequency i would normally forbade
but we rolled quite a low number
let me go for a little check raise here
getting calls
going to follow it up with a little
barrel
guys we're pretty muddy with the seven
dudes again should we so we put the back
the bed back on the bed back on
oh how did you thinking about it my
friend what are you thinking about
the germans oh
what's disciplined disciplined hardest
i'm asking about your name what does the
weko mean what is the origin of your
screen name ah
well actually you might not be surprised
but when i first started playing poker i
played a lot in like uh some local cafes
and stuff and people always said that i
was crazy
yeah a little bit of a crazy guy so
that's kind of where the weka came from
just that guy's the guy's a little bit
wacko
here i check turn
check check um
bet on the river
captain stupid
finland okay that's uh the rng is
leaning towards call when i see finland
show me my friend
thank you very much thank you very much
but it was a very
i was i was considering more like not
but i mean if this is actually it's a
it's a fine bluff like
i was thinking hands like ace nine with
ace of diamonds a6 with ace of diamonds
a7 with the ace of diamonds no that
probably actually better turn ace jack
with the ace of diamonds ace 10 with the
ace of diamonds
or like indeed like a hand with the ten
of dimes then the dime is also a very
fine
uh bluff candidate maybe even actually
better
but hey how sick is that
how sick is that oh my god
am i the best 10 a minute sit say it
you have to say it anyone ever seen the
the response of the other guy actually i
should have also added actually the
response of the other guy in there as
well
now the guy is like yeah in fact i think
you're pretty good you know he felt
quite some pressure
ben got a three bed here
she going to calm a little bit deep
what is the origin of captain's stupid
name good question
is jacob
squeeze the other table with bucket
kings it's premium time guys
let we face a barrel easy call again
but expect to see ace king quite often
if he has ace king with a heart or ac
with a heart actually not doing that
well
interesting river
actually face a phase of four bed here
i go for the call actually we win the
queens guys we win the queens
the guy went yolo five seven suited guys
he gave up the river a little bit
chicken chicken
[Music]
oh there's definitely good river to
bluff actually oh
soon tell you guys what he had
oh guys we're gonna give it all away on
the cooler again guys
are you [ __ ] kidding me
are we gonna give it all away again on
the cooler
i'm not folding unless a river is a four
or uh ace
a heart i don't know interesting river
check back kings one time chop chop come
on my friend chop chop
and this guy goes all in mr hardish from
germany these romans they're coming for
me
the two months okay my friends
you got it is seven dudes off good
enough to play versus mr arete
i think so come on wing guy get out of
the way my friend come on
okay come on mr jizumi just you and me
my friend
you don't have anything what are you
you're gonna rap
you know what i think of this is
complete bollocks as they say
i make a little raisin raisin and he
falls
ha that dolce gabbana in the little
pajamas
pajama yeah yeah pajama it's a birthday
gift from
friends it's nice let's go for a format
what do we want to do with
thank you lucky river or unlucky river
i don't think there's anything else to
do than
jan jam and hope sounds like
a valid strategy here
oh he's snapchat i was going to say this
is unlucky river or lucky river but it
was an unlucky river
ggg nice answer nice hand sir am i going
to rate you guys soon
viscale bartha i don't know what that
means but i completely agree oh maybe
maybe we win a nice little tree in a
baby pot here at the end
are we at least have a 10
[Music]
off pot so far seems reasonably
standard
honda would be definitely jamming this
turn if he barrels
wanna maybe it's a bit more interesting
huh we actually still win hey
