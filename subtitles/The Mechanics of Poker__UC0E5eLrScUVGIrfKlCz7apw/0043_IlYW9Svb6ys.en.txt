come on jax one time is in a heart
nine ten of hearts oh he raises
okay uh
yes call and he blufferies me with the
[ __ ] things
shout out to that guy man gotta give
some credit to this guy
what
[Music]
do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo yes yes yes yes
yes yeah it's the start of a new echo
show the seven deuce challenge is
over unfortunately sad faces i mean i
have my own challenge which is
uh actually i changed also the title
from 500 to
500 to 10k that is now the challenge
and if i want to i can go play 10k
tomorrow obviously but
i kind of want to work my way up
kind of start moving up at the at the
point where i'm like yeah
i feel quite good but i'm playing let's
move up
and i think we have an easy value bet
twice here but also check out the river
you see this one's quite close i think
we're going to check all the river
had a little bit of a strong hand like
eight or nines i would definitely just
bet i think seven eight
okay that's quite a big bet but this guy
is a little bit crazy
or at least that's my note on him
somehow
okay let's let's start of the stream
let's start with the stream guys let's
start
[Music]
oops i did it again
i caught with a seven and you lost the
pot
oh baby baby good decision to check god
damn it man this is also quite
interesting
so he limped german i sawed mr oppa
i called he squeezed okay
i have jared calls i mean as well well
jared just go
you know we like to flop sets on the
wacko show
don't take that away from us man love
that money in the pot you should
probably do quite some jamming yeah
can imagine
what size did he go to he went what is
this
32 and he calls okay ace is alert
what the [ __ ] is going on his head and
now front gems okay i like this play
actually he probably has jax queens
hey he fronted no way
no he didn't just do that seriously
what this made no sense whatsoever guys
why would you ever
so he calls preflop to let the guy in
okay
but then he front just the flop this is
actually this is seriously one of the
most ridiculous hands i've ever seen
even i say he's a diamond hey
this is
i i hope he misclicked somehow
miss click frontier so i have a little
seabed here if it was ace four five i
would definitely
check i think h46 is still probably dry
enough
turn is close i'm gonna go for an over
bat
i don't have a heart turn as a queen so
let's like the ids ace queen
you could have six extra hearts that
you're gonna call me with you could even
call me here with like i had like six
five six seven i think there's a finance
to call it
and wherever i'm gonna check
unless he fronts bats which he's
considering
quite a funky play hard hard to include
bloss
he was considering that one as a bluff i
would have minded man i wouldn't have
mined it oh
no that's a good hand
seriously guys nobody
nobody
there's a little check race here going
to call at least one
interesting term
it blocks
[Music]
call seems appropriate that's a good
river
and i don't think there's much else to
do than to call
yeah i don't think he's bluffing much
but he could have the same hand
like if he jams i'm not happy but yeah
yeah yeah yeah hey checks
i'm gonna bet the river
i'm not like overly thrilled about this
hand if he now raises
if he gets force
to play like if he would have bet
himself let's say
james i would definitely call ace queen
he can have the same hand but if he now
would check race
yeah i don't know
force tense queen 10 suited all day my
friend
that would be a very funky line if he
managed to find a bluff there
make a little not so gto stabbing
but hey clearly this is a deliberate
deviation from the quote-unquote correct
strategy
turn is interesting
i'm going to check
and check i hope to win versus
a7 s5
it's a stylish tattoo from japan
a king queen suit is unlikely
i think i'm going to check this
versus a recreational
wait for him to make a nice hand and
then go for a big bet
it's my strategy
come on jax one time ace and a heart
nine ten of hearts oh he raises
okay uh
yes call and he blufferies me with the
[ __ ] things
shout out to that guy man gotta give
some credit to this guy what the
who was that stylist teto that guy is
[ __ ] stylish man
japanese kamikaze style stylish tattoo
man
ain't giving [ __ ] i make a little over
bet here with the
queen 10 suit that is what they call a
flush
flush flesh flush
not really sure about sizing somewhere
between one third and three quarters
i think i see this hand just three
quarters probably
here we're gonna get a little call
he ain't folding he ain't folding
because he had two pair what was he
thinking about
well okay i didn't get that i don't know
what he was thinking about with the two
pair here this is what you do with two
pair you
click call and then the guy is the worst
top pair
that's what you do
eight nine if at eight seven or
something i would definitely check race
eight nine without a club seemed a
little bit optimistic okay
barrels just three quarter resizing
we probably have a calm probably still
have the best hand
i don't really see much point in raising
here pocket sevens
off but
he calls i'm gonna
go for i'm not really sure actually what
i'm gonna go for here
i'll go for the check rip it in
i'm gonna actually go for the barrel
we have a funky barrel here or funky
barreling
don't rip it in please
[Music]
all right good luck
oh he had a little little little he
tried to do a little fluffy
i'm a genius oh my god
that's got to be the greatest car in
poker
oh my god oh my god
am i the best 10 admit it said say it
you have to say it you got to say it
guys you got to say it you got to say it
you got to say it king 10
how sick is that how sick is that
i'm gonna click
i feel like his gem is only kings and
aces that's that's really [ __ ] up
though
uh queens
nah he shouldn't be jamming queens
versus a click
ah
ship it let's go
i know man i don't know thinks i'm some
crazy guy
one second guys you got pocket aces but
what i was saying is that there is a
musculus coming
in eight days 26 minutes 26 seconds this
is also my accountability
i'm going to be talking about three
reports out of position i'm currently at
the river section so
should be able to get that done
while we're gonna stack up pocket aces
versus mr gary
oh gary
gary gary gary
make a little c-bap
what you gonna do gary what you gonna do
what you gonna do when the echo comes
for you
gary gary what you gonna do what you're
gonna
do when the wacko comes for you and he
has pocket aces
take another little bet here
now it's a little bit interesting
scary there's a little bit of a knit
is gary really gonna call me down here
with queens kings jesus
ah or is anyone but gary jam oh he had
he had a set
oh my god oh my god
so here the weko played his hand
perfectly in my opinion at least
he should also play it differently
sometimes but i think this is a really
fantastic
line while we play this eight nine hand
here versus a tight knit
you raise me on the flop
it's obviously not great versus a tight
knit
but hey we can still improve in some
ways so i'm not folding
okay interesting
is there any value in betting don't
think so i think our
bad nines or something i would
definitely bet but i think this hand is
just too weak
i'm gonna call the river i think there's
like king seven or something
h3 it was a one-and-done little raisin
i want to thank you all guys for tuning
in again and i will see you guys back on
monday
good luck at the tables yeah i think
that's all
