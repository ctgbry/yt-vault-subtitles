[00:00]
If I wanted to become the number one
poker player in the world, would I
repeat that? Probably not, but life was
more fun that way. Today, we are joined
by highstakes poker player, content
creator, and entrepreneur
aliases. Alias began his poker journey

[00:16]
aliases. Alias began his poker journey
at the cash game tables where he
successfully climbed the ranks to high
stakes. Maybe I'm not the best poker
player in the world, but I can still
study three hours a situation and I can
tell you everything about it because I I

[00:30]
tell you everything about it because I I
know how to study the situation. Along
the way, he discovered a passion for
content creation which led him to
transition into MTS. Imagine you have 10
million videos under 60% audience
retention. You are at

[00:45]
retention. You are at
61%. But you are on top of 10 million
videos. Now he's closing in on 500K
subscribers on YouTube, owns one of the
largest Spanish-speaking poker schools,
and continues to compete at the highest
levels. Uh I learned that it is very

[01:00]
levels. Uh I learned that it is very
important to separate uh your days
between management days and maker days.
And then on top of that, you create
seasons. He has won multiple scoop
titles, a W coupe, and recently won
back-to- back 25k high rotors at EBT

[01:16]
back-to- back 25k high rotors at EBT
Cyprus, profiting over€1 million euro
this year alone. So, first of all, I
just wanted to make enough money so I
could just be left alone. I didn't enjoy
the game of poker as much as I enjoyed

[01:30]
the game of poker as much as I enjoyed
being good already at other video games.
It's just that those video games would
not make money. I I was very into hats.
I I I used to have a hat with 1,200
stats in 2013 with 20 pop-ups. I find
myself very surprised when I read

[01:48]
myself very surprised when I read
certain things on social media from
people who clearly don't know what they
are saying. First of all, you're not
understanding where he's coming from.
The other guy is not understanding what
the other guy is thinking. You both are

[02:01]
the other guy is thinking. You both are
way too dumb to have a conversation and
understand each other. Why do you even
talk? That kind of thing. Do you know
what I mean?

going to be another great episode of the

ado, guys, enjoy this episode. Alias,
your poker journey. It started back in
2010, I believe, at the online cash game
tables. I was wondering what like first
drew you to the game and at what point
did you realize that this could actually

[02:46]
did you realize that this could actually
be a profession that you would pursue?
Okay. Um,
basically it all started when I was uh
looking for a job that I could

[03:01]
looking for a job that I could
do that depend on my skill and not on
somebody else.
Uh I I I I was in a situation where I
started uh three
careers. I left the three of them uh the

[03:18]
careers. I left the three of them uh the
first year because I
was in increasingly feeling depressed as
I was studying the careers and imagining
how my life would be like after I finish

[03:31]
how my life would be like after I finish
them. H so I I I f I I I I was seeing my
my future the kind of future I would
have having those jobs as extremely
depressing. I was studying things I
didn't care

[03:46]
didn't care
about. Just I felt forced to choose
something. I didn't know what I really
wanted to do. I only knew that I had fun
when I was a a teenager playing a
strategy video games.

[04:01]
strategy video games.
And but that didn't translate to any
real job. Uh at the time, Twitch didn't
assist like it does today. Erh content
creators were not a thing yet in 2010.

[04:15]
creators were not a thing yet in 2010.
It was it was starting maybe a couple of
year years later. H but I I was not even
interested on on doing any anything like
that at the time. I was just
seeking I I don't know something just

[04:32]
seeking I I don't know something just
something that I could do that wasn't
depressing that could could create any
future where I could control my time the
way I work
um and feel good about life in general.

[04:46]
um and feel good about life in general.
I I didn't see that. I I I didn't see
that in any option. And poker came up as
a as
a very random option. H I played a a
game of poker with a few friends. Uh one
night I lost very fast. It was very

[05:02]
night I lost very fast. It was very
boring to see everyone play for two
hours after I busted very quickly
because I didn't know what I was doing.
I got home.
I I was uh searching information on how
to play. Uh so the next time we I I

[05:17]
to play. Uh so the next time we I I
joined them, I could at least
uh last longer and and then I found the
forums of Intellipoker and at the time
and they had uh these threads of people

[05:31]
and they had uh these threads of people
speaking
about going up levels, learning how to
make money. they they were having those
conversations in the forum and I saw
that and I realized maybe there is

[05:47]
that and I realized maybe there is
something
here. Uh so I started exploring the the
game. Yeah, it was like that how it
happened. What was your goal like
starting out when you when you started

[06:01]
starting out when you when you started
out playing quotequote professionally?
Did you have like a specific vision for
where you wanted to go or did you take
it more like one step at a time?
It was uh clearly independence. So first
of all, I just wanted to make enough

[06:15]
of all, I just wanted to make enough
money so nobody else could tell me what
I needed to do. That was the first thing
because I felt that I had to do things I
didn't want to do but I had to because
I you know at the time there there was

[06:32]
I you know at the time there there was
not the option to not do anything. Uh
and I believe that wasn't
the best
approach for a person in the situation I

[06:45]
approach for a person in the situation I
was in. I I I I think if I have a a kid
in the future and they don't know what
to do at 18, I think it would not it
would not be the end of the war if they
take a take a year off to think and
explore options

[07:01]
explore options
and understand what what is behind an
option, you know, because the the issue
is uh having options but not knowing
anything about what's in there if you
actually follow that path. Uh

[07:15]
actually follow that path. Uh
so for me at the time it was
very
emotionally painful uh to have to make
those decisions follow those path leave
them uh feeling that I was a

[07:31]
them uh feeling that I was a
disappointment for everyone around me
who was trusting me in those decisions.
Uh, so first of all, I just wanted to
make enough money so I could just be
left alone. So that was the first

[07:45]
left alone. So that was the first
priority. I didn't even know if poker
would be something I could become good
at. I I I was not sure uh I I I didn't
enjoy the game of poker as much as I
enjoyed being good already at other

[08:01]
enjoyed being good already at other
other video games. It's just that those
video games would not make money. Uh so
I was just thinking okay maybe so I am
thinking that I never felt particularly

[08:17]
thinking that I never felt particularly
good at anything uh during a school. I I
was not uh someone who I would consider
smart based on my grades or based on my
results. Uh I wasn't interested on

[08:31]
results. Uh I wasn't interested on
anything. I was I I was just the kind of
guy who would study a bit, get my five
out out of 10, pass, and continue
continue life, right? Uh so I was just
thinking maybe what I learned in video

[08:47]
thinking maybe what I learned in video
games, I could use that in poker to make
enough money to survive. That was the
first priority of some of something that
you learned in video games that could
help you in poker. So I I think video

[09:02]
help you in poker. So I I think video
games teach you action reaction
situations, right? So it's like
uh whatever you do has a consequence
and many bad decisions will lead to you

[09:17]
and many bad decisions will lead to you
losing the game. Uh poker is the same
thing. If you think
about many things in life which are not
related with entrepreneurship

[09:31]
related with entrepreneurship
erh
or I I I I don't know basically being
responsible of your own actions uh many
of them are emotionally
driven so sometimes actions don't lead

[09:45]
driven so sometimes actions don't lead
to consequences in the way
uh others other situations would
actually led uh to actual
consequences. So, so I I think it was
just the the feeling that if I could be

[10:02]
just the the feeling that if I could be
good at this, maybe I can be good at
poker. That it was that that was the
thinking. When was like the first moment
where you started to get some success,
you know, in this poker thing where
you're like, "Hey, I I'm I'm going to

[10:15]
you're like, "Hey, I I'm I'm going to
make this as a professional poker
player." Do you recall like the first
moments of of like success?
It it it happened actually after 6
months of uh testing the game and and

[10:31]
months of uh testing the game and and
learning. I I remember playing this uh
double of nothing games that existed
back in the day. Uh I I I saw those like
less risk compared to other games. Uh I
tried uh different things at the end. I

[10:46]
tried uh different things at the end. I
uh learned uh how to make money playing
full ring games in cash games at the
time. And actually uh now that I am
thinking about it, I think uh I never
thought about if video games helped me

[11:03]
thought about if video games helped me
uh in my poker career at the beginning,
but I do know poker has helped me a lot
in entre
entrepreneurship. there I I can see a
lot of examples of how now I see things

[11:16]
lot of examples of how now I see things
and I divide task in many different
groups. I I I I tried to understand
everything around situations and that
actually uh I got it from poker. But
when I was a teenager, I I I I would say

[11:32]
when I was a teenager, I I I I would say
I was not as wise probably uh I was just
thinking maybe I can use these skills,
this competitive drive that I have here,
I can use it here. Uh and maybe it leads

[11:45]
I can use it here. Uh and maybe it leads
to something. I don't know. Yeah. Maybe
I have an example. I'm sure you are in
touch with other entrepreneurs or you
know you work together with other
people. What's an example of a way a
poker player would look at a problem
within business that other people they

[12:00]
within business that other people they
they would just not look at from that
angle.
So probably ignoring things that
matter, right? Uh so when when you're
playing a hand of poker, you are
worrying about what is your range? Uh

[12:16]
worrying about what is your range? Uh
what is the situation? how many players
could become part of the hand at some
point and how you are going to adapt
your strategy based on that. Then
someone does
something okay what do I do now? Uh you

[12:31]
something okay what do I do now? Uh you
need to think about your bet size
things. What group of hands will uh will
you bet or or will you call if somebody
does anything?
uh and and then you continue to filter
what is going on and make all sorts of

[12:47]
what is going on and make all sorts of
decisions during the hand. Uh so
basically the the the way you think uh
dur during a poker hand you try to
understand and think about everything
that could affect the EV of the hand

[13:03]
that could affect the EV of the hand
itself. Right? So in business I think it
is the the same thing. uh you you
you think you can create a product.
Okay. You you start trying to create the

[13:17]
Okay. You you start trying to create the
product. Uh and as as you do the the
job, you start having some a lot of you
see a lot of things you didn't know that
they were even there. Uh and then you

[13:30]
they were even there. Uh and then you
create like the goal of okay, I'm going
to manage this thing uh the best way I
can. uh you know the one thing poker
didn't help me enough uh in
entrepreneurship it was uh in terms of

[13:46]
entrepreneurship it was uh in terms of
learning to delegate uh to to find help
to create systems for other people to
follow. Uh that was the part that poker
uh was not uh really helpful because it
is a game where you are uh it is just

[14:02]
is a game where you are uh it is just
used just you against everyone right in
entrepreneurship it's more like uh you
need to be the leader of a team you need
to find help I didn't find help early
enough uh so that was a mistake

[14:15]
enough uh so that was a mistake
certainly when I was playing uh with
people like you uh high stakes cash
games I didn't get help early enough. Uh
I was trying to do everything alone and
that wasn't a good decision. But at the

[14:30]
that wasn't a good decision. But at the
same time I I also learned that
I do something which is not very helpful
which is that I try to seek perfection
in everything I
do which is very bad. Also if you are

[14:48]
do which is very bad. Also if you are
uh starting a lot of new things that you
don't know anything about because then
you it's just that you are trying so
hard in so many different things it
creates a huge stress uh on

[15:02]
creates a huge stress uh on
yourself and and
and yeah
maybe I can explain better with some
some specific examples. uh not not sure

[15:15]
some specific examples. uh not not sure
I'm not sure how how fun it will be as a
conversation but where where where do
you think this uh perfection or need for
perfection came from and do you did you
already notice that like earlier in your
poker career that you're trying to show

[15:30]
poker career that you're trying to show
up perfect for example you're trying to
play perfect
uh I would say that uh I tried many
different things uh during my career uh
I think The seeking perfection thing
started even after I

[15:46]
started even after I
I starting battling in high stakes
because I got uh very interested in
studying GTO. Uh so I would spend a lot
of time with PO solver
uh uh doing

[16:02]
uh uh doing
calculations and and so many other
things. Uh I
also realized uh that it was very
helpful to play against strong players
to learn faster because because you

[16:15]
to learn faster because because you
could see situations that that would not
happen very often uh when you were
playing against uh weaker players or the
the other type of uh games. But
the the perfection thing uh I think it

[16:32]
the the perfection thing uh I think it
became more uh so it it grew on me even
more uh when I started uh caring about
being successful on YouTube because I
realized that on YouTube

[16:47]
realized that on YouTube
uh it pays very well to be better than
most. So YouTube, the way it works, the
algorithm it is that the best video wins

[17:01]
algorithm it is that the best video wins
and YouTube is is just interested in
in getting people in uh to to watch uh
videos for longer, right? So the best
video is the video that people will will
watch the longest and the people the the

[17:16]
watch the longest and the people the the
video that people will click on. Uh so
basically if you have a let's say a 55
60%
uh audience retention uh you're winning
against any other video that it is below

[17:31]
against any other video that it is below
55% audience retention. So so imagine
you have I don't know 10 million videos
with uh under 60% audience retention.

[17:45]
with uh under 60% audience retention.
You are you are at 61%. But you are on
top of 10 million videos. Do you know
what I mean? Yeah. Which means that
YouTube is going to recommend that video
instead of all the other ones.
Correct. So you get exponentially higher

[18:00]
Correct. So you get exponentially higher
returns, the more the better your video
is, which is similar in poker, right? I
mean, if you if you're just a bit better
than the rest, you know, you get you get
higher returns.
you get higher returns but you don't get

[18:16]
you get higher returns but you don't get
exponential higher returns. True. And
you and I guess also you can decide who
you compete against whereas on YouTube I
mean yeah you you you compete against
whole YouTube you know you cannot really
game select. Exactly.
Exactly. Exactly. In the poker game you
are against maybe five other players. Uh

[18:32]
are against maybe five other players. Uh
if you're playing six max right on
YouTube you are playing against million
of content creators. Uh so basically if
you can become uh top 1% or even higher

[18:45]
you can become uh top 1% or even higher
than that erh you're just going to win
uh over everyone because there is a
limited amount of space in the YouTube
feed for for your video to show. Uh so

[19:00]
feed for for your video to show. Uh so
when I realized that that there are
exponential
uh returns for being very very good at
making a video then is when I started um
seeking perfection in all the details of

[19:16]
seeking perfection in all the details of
a video. So I would study the how the
videos perform which is uh here is what
where poker became useful. uh in the
same way I would study a hand everything
that it is involved with a poker hand

[19:31]
that it is involved with a poker hand
and I would try to understand everything
about it to make a good decision. I
would start thinking the same way about
uh YouTube content. Okay, if I speak for
two minutes about how I feel about this

[19:45]
two minutes about how I feel about this
random thing, uh maybe it becomes
boring, right? Uh but if I speak for 30
seconds and then uh I continue I I move
on to something else or I understand the
topic. Uh
um so for example uh for

[20:04]
um so for example uh for
um I also believe for YouTube is very
very important to be yourself to be to
to show yourself as the person you

[20:15]
to show yourself as the person you
really
are. But at the same time it is not good
for
videos to to speak about too many things
and those things to not be related with

[20:31]
and those things to not be related with
each other. Right? So when I uh started
making videos I will make all sorts of
mistakes. I would mix a poker session
that lasts 20 minutes with me eating
ramen for 10 minutes and me walking in

[20:47]
ramen for 10 minutes and me walking in
in a street for another five minutes
with a lot of noise from traffic.
Um there was
um learning path basically studying

[21:02]
um learning path basically studying
audience retention charts and how things
were uh going in the channel that lead
to uh better videos basically
understanding better videos for uh

[21:16]
understanding better videos for uh
videos people would would watch uh
longer. But at the same time, I tried to
mix that with making videos I like to
watch or I would like to watch. Uh

[21:30]
watch or I would like to watch. Uh
making and and the rule I follow is I
try to make videos that I will be glad I
did when I am 80 years old. If I I can
uh reach that age. I I want to see that
young me long time ago. and and just hey

[21:48]
young me long time ago. and and just hey
grandson come here look at
your look at your uh grandad when he was
uh living adventures
please place what is the favorite video

[22:00]
please place what is the favorite video
you have on your YouTube channel what's
your own personal favorite I'm not sure
if I have a favorite uh to be honest all
in a way are special and take into
consideration that every day I would
upload a new video I would do everything
I can for that video to be the best one

[22:16]
I can for that video to be the best one
I ever made at the
time.
So I I think my favorite videos are the
videos where I travel to a lot of
countries in the same video and and

[22:30]
countries in the same video and and
I and I explain what I am doing and and
why I am doing things and I look happy
because I am living the life I want to
live. So, those are the videos, the
videos that are the the most fun to
watch for me. Yeah, you uh you've

[22:47]
watch for me. Yeah, you uh you've
definitely done your fair share of
traveling. Definitely something we're
going to get into. I in in order to
prepare for the spot, I kind of went
through your YouTube channel and you've
lived in a lot of countries. You you've
had quite quite the experiences
globally. Uh I want you you touched on

[23:00]
globally. Uh I want you you touched on
uh uh the difference between poker and
being a entrepreneur, leading a team,
setting up systems for other people to
follow. What about systems for yourself?
So maybe take it back to, you know, your
poke career. You ended up becoming a

[23:17]
poke career. You ended up becoming a
high stakes catch game player over those
years. I think between, let's say,
somewhere 2011 2017. I think you worked
your way up to high catch games.
2015 I start I started

[23:32]
2015 I start I started
uh testing uh a bit uh with not a lot of
success success. Uh 2016 was the first
year I made decent money uh playing
higher

[23:45]
higher
stakes and at some point at the end of
2016 2017 I tried to play only
uh battles
uh with other players like yourself. And

[24:01]
uh with other players like yourself. And
the the at the time what I was trying to
do is to to learn uh against very strong
players and try to get all the
information I can so I could improve.
What

[24:15]
What
did what what did playing the wacko
teach you?
Uh you were very flexible in in many
things. uh you did uh I I would say my
background

[24:31]
background
uh was a bit more tight uh in some uh
cases. Uh so for example, you would
check race me with middle pair a5 in 753
uh things like that, right? Uh to

[24:47]
uh things like that, right? Uh to
protect uh the value of your hand uh
against f future streets and move on
from there. Uh things like that. uh I
would not I would I would not do them uh

[25:00]
would not I would I would not do them uh
as often or or at all.
And those kind of things um experiencing
uh playing against someone someone who
is doing those kind kind of things uh
teach teach you a lot and not only you

[25:17]
teach teach you a lot and not only you
any other very good player I was playing
against I would take away things and
that would that would uh become part of
me later on. Throughout this journey
towards high stakes, was there ever a

[25:30]
towards high stakes, was there ever a
moment between when you started playing
poker professionally and you reached
high stakes cash games that you were
like this was a very bad decision. Maybe
I should not have done this. I'm going
to quit quick poker you mean? Yeah. So
throughout like you started uh 2010 2011

[25:45]
throughout like you started uh 2010 2011
you worked your way up. I'm sure in
those years you know it wasn't all
rainbows and sunshine, right? Was there
any was there any moment where you're
like hm maybe this was not the great
decision? I I I would say I never felt
like I wanted to quit. Uh mainly because

[26:01]
like I wanted to quit. Uh mainly because
I I I saw it terror uh the life I was
living before poker. Uh
so ending the the poker
career was like for what going where

[26:16]
career was like for what going where
doing what it
was scary I would say. I I I I would I
was scared to death if that
happens. The only time I was I had a

[26:30]
happens. The only time I was I had a
very um bad dance win. It it was I
believe in
2013. I I had at the time 100k bank
roll. I lost like 80k 90k. Uh a bit
there was a bit of uh playing higher

[26:46]
there was a bit of uh playing higher
than I should at some point. Uh and and
and that uh also I I I was having a a
coach at the time uh with a cup uh 20BBS
player uh which was not the best uh to

[27:03]
player uh which was not the best uh to
to improve at deep stack but he was very
popular and and I and I tried to to
learn from him uh things.
Uh so that that that didn't go well.

[27:18]
Uh so that that that didn't go well.
Uh and and I remember uh feeling very
scared at the time. Uh still I knew, you
know, I I got the band roll I had uh

[27:30]
know, I I got the band roll I had uh
little by little. So I I I trusted my
ability to make the money back just
lowering the stakes I was playing. And
and and that that is what I did. I I
recover all the money playing one two

[27:46]
recover all the money playing one two
and I I remember also studying the at
the time um it was
200 yeah at the end of two at the end of
2013 I already uh was uh taking a look
at uh some players I was uh I thought

[28:03]
at uh some players I was uh I thought
were very good and one of those uh was
OTB Red Baron. So I would study a lot
the the hands I could find of OTB Red
Baron and that turned out to be a great
decision because uh learning how to how

[28:18]
decision because uh learning how to how
he would structure his game, how would
how would he play uh certain certain
groups of hands in certain situations.
Um that led to a better understanding on

[28:30]
Um that led to a better understanding on
on how to on how to structure my game.
It helped me a lot. I I I it felt like
uh making money was easy. Uh following
those uh uh systems, let's say let's say

[28:47]
those uh uh systems, let's say let's say
um meanwhile I was playing obviously one
two uh as I started playing higher it
was uh more more difficult of course. Of
course,
for the people that are listening, like
that was I think still in pre-solver

[29:01]
that was I think still in pre-solver
area because I can relate. Obviously, I
also studied the heads of I think
everyone just studied OTB. That was like
nowadays you have a solver to study, but
back then we just studied what what's
OTB doing and we would try to figure out
why and then and then copy that into our
games, right? That's how we that that

[29:15]
games, right? That's how we that that
that's how you got better back in the
days. Uh, talking about the OTB, in uh,
I think it was 2017, you actually
competed in the Poker Stars Allstar
Showdown, an event where some of the
best online cash games players came to
battle it out. A bit similar actually to
what Coin Poker recently did with the

[29:31]
what Coin Poker recently did with the
World Championship. Um, oh, the B was
actually one of the contenders as well.
Uh, ended up not winning it because who
ended up winning it uh, was you,
Alias? No, I I I I was winning until the

[29:45]
Alias? No, I I I I was winning until the
last uh two or three days that uh I
believe Hatrick was the one who won it
at the end. Really? I was I was You won
it. I think I was
I was uh winning it, but Hatrick

[30:02]
I was uh winning it, but Hatrick
actually won it at the end. I think
Yeah, I think it was him. That's not
fair. It was fun. What? I mean, you you
still got close. What made you What do
you think uh gave you an edge over the

[30:15]
you think uh gave you an edge over the
majority of the field? Even OTB?
I I actually would not say I had an edge
uh over the field.
Uh it
um for me it it was the same thing as
playing with with you. It was just let's

[30:33]
playing with with you. It was just let's
see what I can do here and let's learn
uh from these guys and let's make also
content uh about this. H and here I
believe is where I start making some

[30:47]
believe is where I start making some
questionable decisions. Uh for example
uh the all stars I recorded everything
uh all everything I played I recorded it
and I uploaded on YouTube. Those were
one

[31:00]
one
u I I would say not the first videos I
made but close to the close to the first
um I made like maybe 10 episodes of the
allar game. And one of the things I did
because I thought it would it would not

[31:16]
because I thought it would it would not
be good for YouTube it was playing with
a hat for example.
Erh, you know, back in the day, I was a
very
um what's the word I'm looking

[31:32]
um what's the word I'm looking
for? I I was very into hats and things
like that. I I I used to have a hat with
1,200 stats in 2013 with 20 popups with
all sort of uh stats that custom made

[31:48]
all sort of uh stats that custom made
about what what are you bluffing between
60% bet and 75% bed in bet on in this
particular position that kind of thing
you know I would I would have a stat for

[32:02]
everything but at the time the allar
started
uh I was already
becoming uh more interested in the GTO
part of the game. So So this is actually
one of the the questions I had I have

[32:17]
one of the the questions I had I have
for you, which is how do you
uh I I think the the the I think I know
the answer, but what do you think
matters more? uh focusing your game more

[32:31]
matters more? uh focusing your game more
on understanding GTO and making exploits
based on that or had related things or
had related decisions. The thing is that
at the time I was thinking I think GTO

[32:45]
at the time I was thinking I think GTO
matters way more. Uh so I was trying to
understand the GTO
um part of the game. uh and it was very
early in the in
the GTO let's say fever

[33:01]
the GTO let's say fever
u so so I decided okay I I think it's
not good for YouTube to play with a hat
people are going to say what is this h
they are not going to understand
it poker on YouTube was not

[33:15]
it poker on YouTube was not
as popular or as mainstream ka maybe as
it is now now Mhm. So I decided to not
use a hat basically during the whole
Allar. And the second questionable
decision that I made it was recording

[33:30]
decision that I made it was recording
the the Allar game with a camera in my
hand. So I was not even capturing the
screen, you know. I was actually
recording it like
this. Uh so obviously that's a lot of

[33:47]
this. Uh so obviously that's a lot of
fun. I I I I I was just trying to make
the
content more like action content. Mhm.
Um so you were more worried about making
good content than trying to play your

[34:00]
good content than trying to play your
best poker to to beat up your Actually,
actually I was worried about both
things. The thing is that you can try to
do both things. It doesn't mean you're
going to do a good job doing
both. But I I was doing my best in

[34:15]
both. But I I was doing my best in
everything. I I I was doing, but that
didn't mean I was playing the the best
way I I could. And something as simple
as missing a very good hand, you didn't
open races because you were actually
speaking about something else that was

[34:31]
speaking about something else that was
happening on another table. Uh so those
kind of things um actually uh I I would
say
uh were the the end of feeling that I
could play those uh games uh that I

[34:47]
could play those uh games uh that I
could battle in in those games because I
was trying to make content while I was
uh playing very strong
players and that led to me deciding that
maybe if I play tournaments also at the

[35:02]
maybe if I play tournaments also at the
time I was realizing that uh poker
content was way more mainstream in
tournament uh compared to cash games. So
so I felt maybe if I play poker
tournaments I can actually compete at a

[35:18]
tournaments I can actually compete at a
high
level while at the same time I am making
content.
So that was a decision I had to make
uh between 2017

[35:34]
uh between 2017
2018 I think it was 2018
2019 19
early deciding to not continue playing C
games which was at the time super

[35:46]
games which was at the time super
difficult for me uh because it it was
all I did for many years. How do you uh
like transitioning onto other things?
You know, I've experienced uh the same
thing. How do you
then sort of let go of that part of you

[36:03]
then sort of let go of that part of you
and kind of close that chapter? For
example, I've always and I would say
even up until today struggle with like
an attachment towards me as Renee the
Cash game player, right? Like I'm a good
cash game player and that's me. That

[36:16]
cash game player and that's me. That
that's my identity, you know? I can do
all these other things. thinks I can
make a great podcast for for our
audience, right? But it's still like
what really matters to me is my cash
game capabilities. Did you notice
any any resistance there like

[36:30]
any any resistance there like
transitioning on or did you have less
attachment to to your you as a cash game
player and were just like well no I'm
aliasing poker player I make great
content I transition to
MTS. I

[36:45]
MTS. I
think I in the same way uh you feel that
way. I I did too. I was
uh Elias Sin Karma uh the guy who played
uh Kas game high

[37:00]
uh Kas game high
stakes
and you know starting in tournaments I
had a few issues too uh because I was
creating content
um you know uh I I I

[37:17]
um you know uh I I I
I think uh we all know that tournament
poker players are usually less
experienced in post flop game for
example. So changing the game I was

[37:31]
example. So changing the game I was
playing uh it was a good
decision in what relates to uh playing
against weaker players at least in what
relates to post flop game. But that

[37:45]
relates to post flop game. But that
doesn't mean that I was good playing pre
flop situations. I I was not good
playing pre flop situations. Uh so
creating content while at the same time
I was learning a new game uh it was
delaying my learning speed. Uh at the

[38:05]
delaying my learning speed. Uh at the
end I I could learn those things. I I
remember
u buying monk solver uh learning how to
use moner solver. I remember erh doing

[38:17]
use moner solver. I remember erh doing
calculations
to for all the positions to literally
calculate the GTO of every possible
situation in in in tournaments and I
even hire a developer to create an

[38:31]
even hire a developer to create an
application to put all that information
on it. uh because I doing that that work
uh would help me to get a better
understanding of of what is uh a a good
pre flop decision uh playing poker

[38:46]
pre flop decision uh playing poker
tournaments and ICM and those things are
things I would consider on top of that.
But yeah, uh I'm not sure if I I was
lost a bit in the in the in the
explanation. And the the real question

[39:00]
explanation. And the the real question
was the original question was about was
about identity and how your identity was
linked to Sin Karma the gas crusher. But
you know you you took it to great
lengths you know uh and I definitely I
definitely relate to a lot a lot of

[39:15]
definitely relate to a lot a lot of
things that you were saying. You did
actually use the fact that uh you you
were teaching yourself tournaments. You
also seem to have used that as a way to
make content. uh I think also around
2018 you opened your poker school right

[39:30]
2018 you opened your poker school right
Zeros poker did you then use basically
the school as okay I'm going to study
these things and in the same time I'm
going to create like a course out of
it yes the first content I I did in the
pocket school uh was content based on

[39:45]
pocket school uh was content based on
what I already knew about the game in
cash games so I mainly focus on on cash
games and the original goal of making a
pocket school was actually to finance
hiring editors and and getting help to

[40:01]
hiring editors and and getting help to
make the YouTube theme bigger.
So, I realized that I'm not sure if you
know if you know this, but making
content in Spanish pays like 5x less

[40:16]
content in Spanish pays like 5x less
compared to making content in English.
So, actually the money I can make from
YouTube is very little. Even today I am
making maximum 4K 5K per month on the
two channels I have with 300k

[40:31]
two channels I have with 300k
subscribers almost and another one with
200k
and that's not a lot uh compared to what
the same size English speaking channels
are are making. They're making way way

[40:46]
are are making. They're making way way
more. Uh so uh one of the things I
realized in
2018 19 it was that I f I found a new
passion.

[41:01]
passion.
Um so this was difficult to also to
manage at the same time I was a very
competitive poker player because in
purpose I made the consu the conscious

[41:16]
purpose I made the consu the conscious
decision of I'm not going to play any
video game ever doesn't matter what
comes up and it it doesn't matter what
happens in the war pocket is the only
thing that matters to me and I said that

[41:31]
thing that matters to me and I said that
to myself from
2009 uh to
2018. So for a long period of time,
poker was the only thing that existed in
my life. I would make some time

[41:45]
my life. I would make some time
sometimes to watch a TV show I like or
something like that.
Uh but that was it. Uh I I would not put
myself in situations where I would enjoy
something. so much that I want to play a

[42:01]
something. so much that I want to play a
game a lot of hours and it's not poker
and basically uh by manage managing
myself that way I could just focus on
poker all the time but YouTube was the
first thing that I let

[42:18]
first thing that I let
u in
my to become part of my
life and I didn't want it out I realized
that I love uh making content and today

[42:33]
that I love uh making content and today
I know that probably I will be making
content all my life because I truly
enjoy it. It's a an art in itself. I
think I became good at it. I don't see

[42:46]
think I became good at it. I don't see
any reason why I should stop it because
I I like it so much.
and I decided or that I would
try to be good at both at both things.

[43:01]
try to be good at both at both things.
Okay, I maybe I cannot is it's not
reasonable to try to become a top five
player in the world, but maybe I can get
as close as possible to being very good
at this game while at the same time I am

[43:15]
at this game while at the same time I am
a very good uh content creator. So, I
changed it a bit. uh my goal to
something more reasonable. So I would
not stress myself way too much because
trying to trying to improve all the time

[43:31]
trying to trying to improve all the time
at at something
uh if you are putting your time in two
things at the same time is difficult.
Uh

[43:45]
Uh
so many things going were going on at
the time. Yeah. Especially you know if
you have some perfectionistic tendencies
which I can definitely relate to myself
as well. You know everything that I do I
want to try to do the best to my
capabilities right when I play poker I

[44:01]
capabilities right when I play poker I
want to be be be the best poker player I
can be. When you know we have this
podcast I want to make sure that this
podcast is as good as it can be. when I
make content, I want to make sure it's
good to be when I do coaching, I want to
make sure it's good. But yeah, at some
point, you know, I cannot be, you know,
good good at everything, right? And

[44:15]
good good at everything, right? And
especially uh uh the playing poker and
teaching poker, even even though you're
still poker, I feel like playing poker
is a skill in itself, right? Because you
are a performer, whereas teaching poker
is a way sort of different part of your

[44:30]
is a way sort of different part of your
brain sort of, right? You're trying to
explain concept. You're thinking very
rational whereas performing in poker is
way more intuitive, right? and it
requires a very different skill set. So
even though the two are very similar
because you literally are doing the
same, you're talking about poker, I have
found myself that it's very hard to do

[44:47]
found myself that it's very hard to do
both at a high level. you experience
something something similar and when you
by the way when you also talk about
content creation do you also then mean
like creating courses because you create
content for YouTube which I think at
least nowadays a bit more like a

[45:00]
least nowadays a bit more like a
lifestyle vlog type of stuff and
zerospoker.com is more actual poker
educational courses correct
correct when I think about creating
content I am thinking mostly about

[45:15]
content I am thinking mostly about
creating
uh content for YouTube. And I always
thought of my pocket school as something
that I want to do very well. Of course,
because I do care about uh providing the

[45:31]
because I do care about uh providing the
best experience I can. I also agree with
you that when you are creating uh
teaching content, you are using
different different skill sets compared
to uh playing poker. Uh, for example, I
could not be the maybe I'm not the best

[45:48]
could not be the maybe I'm not the best
uh poker player in the world, but I can
still study three hours a situation and
I can tell you everything about it
because I I know how to study the
situation. Uh, so I I knew I I could uh

[46:01]
situation. Uh, so I I knew I I could uh
study everything I teach to make sure
it's right. And in that way, I feel I am
proud of what I'm offering. So, I would
do that with every video that I make.
And also I I think I was one of the

[46:15]
And also I I think I was one of the
first and one of the few that also hire
uh editors to produce the content. So
people would watch content that actually
feels good to watch. Uh so that was one
of the things that I did uh too. Uh but

[46:30]
of the things that I did uh too. Uh but
I always thought of uh what I was doing
in the teaching part of my business as
something that I had to do if I wanted
to pay for the YouTube production. And I
will tell you

[46:45]
will tell you
um a very stupid goal that I have right
now. I would love uh next year. I'm not
sure if I'm going to be able to do it uh
because I I I need to learn. But I I was
uh last week uh in a mountain of Japan

[47:01]
uh last week uh in a mountain of Japan
in Nigata
uh practicing snowboarding for the first
time since I was a kid. It it was
something I tried when I was in the
school. I loved it. I injured my my hand

[47:15]
school. I loved it. I injured my my hand
falling. I couldn't practice it again. I
didn't have any money to to to do it. H
but now I can. And my wife uh was
telling me many times, would you want to
come to do a snowboarding with me and

[47:31]
come to do a snowboarding with me and
some friends? And I always said no
because inside of me I was thinking I I
didn't practice this since I was a kid.
I'm 35 years old now. Uh what can I can

[47:45]
I'm 35 years old now. Uh what can I can
I actually be proud of myself doing a
snowboarding? So this is here it comes
the perfectionist, right? H trying
to I can just think about it like
something you can have fun with. You
don't need to be good at it. Uh so I'm

[48:01]
don't need to be good at it. Uh so I'm
trying to teach myself that a bit now.
Uh so I actually said yes uh finally uh
to that experience. So we went to the
mountain. I and I found myself actually
learning how to go down uh from the

[48:16]
learning how to go down uh from the
mountain which was great.
So then I thought it would be so cool
because Japanese
uh mountains are amazing. You know, they
have so much snow. I'm speaking about 3
mters of snow around the the roads. It's

[48:33]
mters of snow around the the roads. It's
like you feel like an ant uh walking
through the path that they created. You
know, there is so much snow and and it
was a lot of fun and these small towns

[48:48]
was a lot of fun and these small towns
uh where you see a small shop uh you
enter, you enjoy great food after a long
day of snowboarding. It it was a
beautiful experience and I thought it
would it would be so cool to make

[49:03]
would it would be so cool to make
like 45 60 days of traveling all the
mountains of Japan and doing a
snowboarding in all of them and making
videos about that
experience. H so so I'm thinking okay

[49:17]
experience. H so so I'm thinking okay
maybe next year I will try to do that
when the season comes. Uh so that's a
very stupid uh experiencebased goal that
I want to do. Now

[49:31]
I want to do. Now
it is really cool if you're if you're
let's just call it lifestyle vlogger
because basically for your job you need
to do all these things right you need to
gain all these experiences. So it's I
feel like you know it's something that a
lot of people would like to do right

[49:45]
lot of people would like to do right
they would like to do all the experience
but you know they have a job to go to
they have to do this but if that's
literally if out and experiencing is
literally sort of your job that's a
pretty cool combination
but the experience is not going to pay
for itself I will not make money doing

[50:00]
for itself I will not make money doing
that not not in a million years I will
spend 10x more than what I make back uh
making that content I will not have a
sponsors So that's where the that's
where the school comes in.

[50:15]
where the school comes in.
Exactly. Uh the the school plays a role
in me being able to accomplish uh
dreams, goals uh in what relates to uh
content creation so I can provide the

[50:32]
content creation so I can provide the
best experience possible for the people
who want to watch uh those videos.
YouTube
itself does not give you the money. It
is the the business that you build
around it. What does Yeah. And the way

[50:47]
around it. What does Yeah. And the way
you can uh various obviously various
ways to to to moni monetize that. I
wanted to get actually get back to the
question you asked me and then I want to
hand it over to Adam.
Um correct me if I'm wrong. I believe
your question towards me was if GTO is

[51:03]
your question towards me was if GTO is
more important or if a HUD using a HUD
was more important. Correct.
What are what are your thoughts between
players who base decisions based on
hats, stats or based on GTO GTO

[51:19]
hats, stats or based on GTO GTO
understanding? I mean, in an ideal
world, I think uh you would play an
individual strategy versus every
individual specifically tailored towards

[51:31]
individual specifically tailored towards
him, right? But we do have to take in
consideration that maybe especially if
you're playing lower stakes there or mid
takes there's a lot of players you're
playing a lot of tables that's not
really feasible. So you need to create
some sort of foundation right for

[51:45]
some sort of foundation right for
example I was very similar actually to
you back in the days when I was playing
highix poker the pool was very small
solvers were coming out there but it was
not as much as a thing. I think usually
the old school players we grew up with
huts because the way our brain made a

[52:01]
huts because the way our brain made a
decision is well I need to know what my
opponent is doing therefore I play
optimal against my opponent. So I was
playing very hutbased strategy. I did I
didn't really have a set strategy like I
would have now. I would just be like oh
yeah this is this guy would have various

[52:15]
yeah this is this guy would have various
opening sizes versus everyone use very
different ranges you know would move my
bluffs to various different lines
depending on how my opponents. So it's
that that the environment is is really
dependent on the correct strategy,
right? The level of your opponent back

[52:32]
right? The level of your opponent back
then people were just had holes all over
the place. So it was it you got way
higher return of investment in putting
time into exploiting your opponents and
building strategies towards specific
opponents. Nowadays, for

[52:45]
opponents. Nowadays, for
example, people all revert, people's
stats all revert a bit more towards GTO,
which kind of forces you to play
quotequote GTO. And then I wanted to add
something on terms of when we talk about
GTO strategies or solver use, they're

[53:00]
GTO strategies or solver use, they're
often talked about in the same way, but
there's a clear difference, right? We
see a solver applying a GTO strategy and
it's applying theoretical principles
about how about the game of poker. We
can learn two different things, right?
the exact balance ring constructions and

[53:15]
the exact balance ring constructions and
the right frequencies that's more around
GTO strategies which aren't that
important in real in real time to some
degree right because the other person
doesn't really know your exact strategy
but certain concepts that we can learn
you know around oh your bet frequency is

[53:30]
you know around oh your bet frequency is
dependent on how much equity you have or
the sizing of your bet is driven around
the nut advantage and the retention of
that stuff like that these are like
theoretical principles that regardless
of the opponent you're playing against
they will apply. So GTO strategies and

[53:45]
they will apply. So GTO strategies and
the value of that apply only to a very
small small amount of opponents but the
bigger theoretical principles about how
poker is played like for example the
concept of equity retention or
strategical consequences to for example

[54:00]
strategical consequences to for example
playing certain SPRs. These are things
that will apply regardless of the level
of your opponent, right? But in general,
the weaker your opponents, the more it's
worth playing an exploitive strategy
towards them. And the stronger your
opponents, the more you're kind of

[54:15]
opponents, the more you're kind of
forced to play a bit more defense and
play solid yourself and try to not screw
up, right? The way you make money is
different. Do you agree with that?
Yes. I I think
uh kind of your answer is like a third

[54:32]
uh kind of your answer is like a third
option, right? Uh so at the time you
were focusing on this player is this guy
against you. I'm going to do this uh
sort of things. And you know the the the

[54:46]
sort of things. And you know the the the
reason why I I make made this question
it was because when I started creating
content I decided I I made a conscious
decision to not use a an advanced hat.

[55:00]
decision to not use a an advanced hat.
Mhm. And I
would the hat was a big part of
uh what I spent my time on early on in
my career. Uh 2012 13 14 I did the

[55:16]
my career. Uh 2012 13 14 I did the
supernova lead uh with a very big hat.
um and even later on. So it was studying
GTO
um of course

[55:30]
um of course
uh not uh speaking about the general um
the general understanding understanding
of the game and the things that that
apply to everyone. I felt that uh
studying GTO would lead to a better

[55:46]
studying GTO would lead to a better
understanding of what was going on in
certain situations, how how the game is
supposed to be played. Uh so in a way I
I would feel okay I'm not using the hat,
but it's not the most important thing.

[56:01]
but it's not the most important thing.
But at the same time, I would feel
insecure uh playing against very strong
players without a hat because I was
making content and I wanted the content
to to be more appealing to people who
are who are not uh professional poker

[56:16]
are who are not uh professional poker
players who play online. So I I always
felt interested about uh and this leads
very well to the second question I had I
had for you uh which is how do you see

[56:32]
had for you uh which is how do you see
uh playing against someone who was
making such a questionable
decisions playing with you h I always
thought h it is an interesting question

[56:45]
thought h it is an interesting question
and it's one of the reasons why I
accepted your podcast. I think it's
interesting to speak with someone who
was your opponent uh who saw you through
the screen as a competitor and and hear
your thoughts uh because uh it was very

[57:03]
your thoughts uh because uh it was very
difficult for me also to to make a video
at some point and explain to my
audience, hey guys, what I am doing
creating content and battling these
games is probably not the best idea. uh

[57:16]
games is probably not the best idea. uh
and I think I should stop it before I
make a mistake and I lose a lot of money
or whatever. Uh and and then I follow a
different path and and tournaments
actually it matters way less to have an

[57:32]
actually it matters way less to have an
advanced hat because context matters way
more in tournaments compared to to cash
games. Uh, the rules of cash games are
what they are. And GTO applies,
exploit exploits apply, the hat can

[57:47]
exploit exploits apply, the hat can
apply. In tournaments, the hat apply
less often than than in cash games. It
it matters, but it doesn't matter as
much to have an advanced uh hat. And
also, you're playing with a way bigger
pool. So, you don't get

[58:00]
pool. So, you don't get
any you you don't get the same sample
any anyway. So, advanced stats don't
matter as much either.
So the the the um the reason to change
to uh play
tournaments that that was a bit of

[58:18]
tournaments that that was a bit of
uh of a reason to change the the game I
I was playing and and I don't know I
thought it would be interesting to to
hear your thoughts. Yeah, you kind of
already mentioned right tournaments
bigger feuds therefore exploit on the

[58:30]
bigger feuds therefore exploit on the
player is a bit less it's not really
worth your time as much right. For
example, if you play high stakes cache
games, you will play against the same
player over and over. Therefore, putting
more time into individual exploits and
understanding how he plays that then
becomes more rewarding, right? It

[58:46]
becomes more rewarding, right? It
doesn't mean that that bigger push you
cannot exploit, but you will for example
instead of studying an individual
player, you will group all the players
and study your population, right? And
look for general tendencloitative
tendencies. So, you will exploit more
the pool instead of the individual

[59:01]
the pool instead of the individual
itself. Now within that, you know, you
could still, for example, look for
certain tendencies and profile your
opponent. Okay, this guy's clearly
recreational player. This guy's a guy
who likes to fight more for putts. This
is a guy who likes to fight less for
putts. And you could then study these
three individual profiles differently.

[59:17]
three individual profiles differently.
Like, okay, if I have identified that
this guy's more to the left compared to
the average population, more to the
right, these are the adjustments that I
will make from my baseline exploitative
strategy based on the pool. So, that's a
way you can kind of combine the two. Uh

[59:31]
way you can kind of combine the two. Uh
in terms of what you were saying, I
actually also I wanted to uh to add No,
actually in terms of what you were
saying
about the consequence it has when you
review strategies. I remember I got I

[59:45]
review strategies. I remember I got I
got to your channel because someone
linked it to me because you recorded one
of the battles that we did. That's
actually how I came to your channel,
right? And you know I do understand some
Spanish but I feel like with translate
as well you can get some idea of
someone's thought process and it really

[1:00:00]
someone's thought process and it really
depends also how open you are like I
also done some streaming and like 500
zoom poos like you can you can talk
through a poker hand and say a lot of
things but you can explain a poker hand
in various ways and one way would make
everything click for someone and the

[1:00:15]
everything click for someone and the
other wouldn't right or with one way you
could reveal a lot that you're
exploiting a lot and in the other
couldn't, for example, I just always
blame the RNG for making an exploitive
decision. There's no RNG in screen, but
I say, "Oh, I rolled high, so therefore
I fold." But no, I folded because this

[1:00:30]
I fold." But no, I folded because this
guy's a nit, you know. So that's that
that's ways that I would I would go
around it. So yeah, I definitely think
at the time you are obviously giving up
uh some EV and especially because you
have a very exploitive approach and you
were also I remember willing to explain

[1:00:46]
were also I remember willing to explain
your exploitive approach. But to be
fair, back then everyone had an
exploitive approach because there was
not not not not GTO to the degree that
there is now. And actually I wanted to
actually I remember now what I wanted to
add about GTO strategy. It is worth it

[1:01:01]
add about GTO strategy. It is worth it
because I heard you mention that it is
worth it to look at okay what would GTO
strategy be and then realize that people
don't and then okay well this is more in
line with what people do then what's the
correct counter exploit. So GTO
strategies from that perspective

[1:01:15]
strategies from that perspective
learning from a solver is not
necessarily to try to implement it
yourself but more okay this is GTO so
this spot is more sensitive for a human
to screw up and then what will be the
consequence so that's still so GTO
strategies specifically I think they
serve more to understanding how we can

[1:01:31]
serve more to understanding how we can
exploit humans instead of seeing it okay
this is GTO strategy this is what I
should try to do uh Adam we talked
earlier about the difference between you
know we both are very active in poker,
right? We talk about poker, think about

[1:01:45]
right? We talk about poker, think about
poker, create content about poker,
create educational content about poker,
teach about poker, and then there's the
playing
poker. Like I explain it sort of as like
two parts of my brain. You obviously
know more about the brain, about how
performance works. Educate us what is

[1:02:01]
performance works. Educate us what is
different like how can why are some for
example very good players very poor
teachers and why are uh players who
focus a lot maybe on teaching and
coaching they might not have the same
results as someone who's only focused on
playing.

[1:02:17]
playing.
Well that's a loaded question. Uh I'll
do my best to put some insights. So
yeah, I think what you're getting at is
the difference between learning about
poker, talking about poker, studying it,
and then the performance side, actually
going to the tables and putting in
volume. I think the biggest challenge

[1:02:31]
volume. I think the biggest challenge
for say yourselves who do a lot of
content, a lot of coaching, and don't
play full-time, it's really hard to get
that sharpness, that performance
sharpness of playing full-time hours.
It's like anything when you're doing it
often, very often, you can like
fine-tune the skill set. I think poker

[1:02:46]
fine-tune the skill set. I think poker
is one of those skills where you can
learn poker all day, but without the
hours at the table grinding, it's really
hard to be really sharp, really
fine-tuned. Hard to define what sharp
means, but everyone who plays poker
relates to when they feel sharp, when
they feel on top of their game. And when

[1:03:00]
they feel on top of their game. And when
you're jumping out of playing and then
studying, going to more creative sides,
thinking about the game, you're not
putting as much reps into the
performance side. So, I think the kind
of simple kind of answer I would give to
that would be uh it's very hard to be
fully sharp and on top of your game when

[1:03:15]
fully sharp and on top of your game when
you're not putting the hours in. I say
the hours that's the criteria that's
relevant to you, but if you're not
putting in the hours that you need to be
on top of your game. So, yeah, I think
it's a it's a challenge. It's when
you're juggling two things at once or in
Ellis's case about 10 things at once. It
gets it's a trade-off that you have to

[1:03:31]
gets it's a trade-off that you have to
be aware of and almost accept because if
you're a young 19-year-old and you can
play poker 10 hours a day, it's a bit
different when you have a family, you've
got to balance things and you might not
have that sharpness when you're playing.
So, I think it's a challenge that you
need to to be aware of. Uh just a few uh

[1:03:46]
need to to be aware of. Uh just a few uh
things I I thought when I was listen
listening to you. I found myself uh in
the past uh seven years trying trying to
it relates very well to what to what you
you just said because it's 100% true and

[1:04:01]
you just said because it's 100% true and
accurate. I found myself uh booking
mounts of my time for one specific thing
and doing just that one thing during
that time. uh so for example okay this
three months I'm just going to focus on

[1:04:15]
three months I'm just going to focus on
studying and playing this uh next two
months I'm going to uh make a course or
whatever or make content about so I I
would try to do only one thing uh
because I would feel what you are saying

[1:04:30]
because I would feel what you are saying
h at the same time uh for for certain
things that need to happen at the same
time for example playing poker at at a
high level uh making content at the same
time. Now, I am a bit glad that I was
already a player who was playing kind of

[1:04:47]
already a player who was playing kind of
high before I started creating content
because I see content creators right now
who have a passion for both things,
poker and content creation.
And I see them having a very I I I I I

[1:05:03]
And I see them having a very I I I I I
know that the challenge they have to
become good at poker and I would I don't
know what I would have done if I had
this kind of distraction when I was
starting it
poker. So I'm kind of glad that I

[1:05:16]
poker. So I'm kind of glad that I
already had an understanding a general
decent understanding of the game when I
started creating content and that has
helped me so much so so much. Um I also
take breaks uh from content creation. Um

[1:05:32]
take breaks uh from content creation. Um
I I took breaks like six or eight months
breaks uh from content creation to study
to to do things related only with
improving my game during the past uh
seven years. But what I would do it is

[1:05:45]
seven years. But what I would do it is
to create a lot of content for three
months or for five months so I can
upload that content during the following
months.
So those are the way the the ways I I I

[1:06:00]
So those are the way the the ways I I I
went around this specific issue. Not uh
there isn't
a a perfect solution but at the same
time if you are able to do everything at
the same time kind of successfully it

[1:06:16]
the same time kind of successfully it
pays off. So it it's like a a difficult
thing to manage
um that I decided to try to manage.
Let's
say I like this concept of working in

[1:06:31]
say I like this concept of working in
seasons and almost like dedicating parts
of your year months at a time to one
particular thing. Obviously there's
overlap and there'll be some task that
you carry on but the overarching theme
of this period. So yeah, let's talk
about that. These kind of structured

[1:06:46]
about that. These kind of structured
seasons of obsession, we'll call them,
where you go deep on an area. How do you
decide on what they are? And what do you
think are some of the the benefits of
kind of separating your your year into
kind of these seasons like this?

[1:07:01]
Uh sometimes I find myself
uh with
decisions that with many different
decisions and and I and thinking of
those decisions as pieces of a puzzle. I

[1:07:18]
those decisions as pieces of a puzzle. I
try to choose the pieces that have more
connection between each other that have
some sort of h synergy I think it's
called is said right synergia in Spanish

[1:07:30]
called is said right synergia in Spanish
h so for example studying the game would
have a good synergy with uh making a
poker course because as you study and
you uh learn things uh you're activating
um the kind of mindset you need to have

[1:07:47]
um the kind of mindset you need to have
to to make good good teaching
content. When I was uh playing poker, I
would just focus on playing poker. Uh
during the past two years, for example,
I started playing more live poker uh

[1:08:01]
I started playing more live poker uh
because also I had the the opportunity
to to be sponsored uh by poker stars. So
I would go to all the European poker
tours and and events and and some other
events. So when there was an event uh my

[1:08:17]
events. So when there was an event uh my
mind my mindset would be this is what I
need to focus right now only two things
going to the event making the best
videos possible and playing the best
poker I can and today h I do have a team

[1:08:33]
poker I can and today h I do have a team
so I need I don't need to do stupid
things such as recording the screen of
my monitor while I play poker or
whatever I I I have videographers with
me who are uh recording everything that

[1:08:45]
me who are uh recording everything that
is happening. H meanwhile meanwhile I
play poker. So I I can actually play
live poker totally focus on my decisions
and my game and still get the content.
Uh so this is evolution obviously in the
in the job. Uh so uh playing poker

[1:09:02]
in the job. Uh so uh playing poker
basically it's not it's something I need
to do
uh focused just on that. At the same
time I can create content. I am
surprised to say that I think streaming

[1:09:15]
surprised to say that I think streaming
poker tournaments I I don't think my
ability to play well decrease too much
compared
to non streaming. Uh actually streaming
force you to be very focused uh and if

[1:09:31]
force you to be very focused uh and if
your setup is comfortable and what I'm
saying is having both hands available
for you to do whatever uh because the
recording with the camera like this was
a very bad idea. Um I think uh playing
poker tournaments if you're not playing

[1:09:45]
poker tournaments if you're not playing
too many tables it's fine. I I I don't
think you are leaving a lot of EV on the
table. the field erh is large enough
that showing your game doesn't ma
doesn't matter as
much so it's fine uh but for streaming

[1:10:03]
much so it's fine uh but for streaming
poker certainly I will do only just that
and how do I choose uh when I do that it
depends on the season there are uh
decisions that are kind of made for

[1:10:15]
decisions that are kind of made for
yourself the event is happening uh this
day or these weeks so those weeks uh you
book uh your time uh for that right uh
so that would be it I I would try to
find synergies between topics choose

[1:10:33]
find synergies between topics choose
those together or uh be forced to do
something at the time that thing need
needs to be done
very interesting yeah as you were
speaking there about the synergy I was

[1:10:46]
speaking there about the synergy I was
thinking of how athletes approach their
years and it's very similar like how
things interact with each other. They
often use the term like periodization
and most sports will follow a model of
an offseason where it's very condition
based, very endurancebased that then

[1:11:00]
based, very endurancebased that then
leads into a more kind of specific
skills training like a preseason and
then you have the season itself and then
you have a peing block almost the end,
the championships of that and each block
like follows on from the other one. So
there's a an overlap structure of we do
this one. So the next one is set up for
the next one. It sounds like the way
you're thinking about what seasons

[1:11:16]
you're thinking about what seasons
you're in, there's an overlap between
those. Oh, this season then leads nicely
into this one. Then I've got this
intense season, then I ease off to this
one. I think it's a a very clever way to
think about planning your year and
rather than plan like a week or a month
because it's a lot more zoomed out, a

[1:11:31]
because it's a lot more zoomed out, a
lot more big picture. So for you, when
did you start to think of your life in
seasons? I know for myself, I got into
planning a bit further ahead, but for a
long time, I was more of a week
structure guy, then I got into months,
and it's only more recently I've got
into a bit more longer planning. for
you. When did you think seasons became

[1:11:46]
you. When did you think seasons became
important to uh to clarify for yourself?
For me, it came as a solution to
uh it came as an intuitive answer for
frustrations uh for feeling frustrated.

[1:12:01]
frustrations uh for feeling frustrated.
Uh so I felt what you
describe this is too many things at the
same time. H so I need to focus on just
one thing and even uh doing
that there would be there would be

[1:12:15]
that there would be there would be
things that just shows up uh in your
life you didn't you didn't want them
there but they are just there. Uh for
example man managing a business uh
having people who work for you. Uh my

[1:12:31]
having people who work for you. Uh my
team uh today is 25 people. Uh so 25
people can talk to you for so many for
for many things. Uh not related with the
thing you are actually doing right now.

[1:12:46]
thing you are actually doing right now.
Um I learned recently uh from uh um
content creator who who is uh very good
at uh managing companies. uh that it's

[1:13:00]
at uh managing companies. uh that it's
good to think about uh
task in two ways like this is a manager
task or this is a maker task. Uh maker
task would be creative erh things

[1:13:16]
task would be creative erh things
uh product creation uh improving your
game playing uh you need to make things
happen and management um manager task
are just answering to this guy who has
an issue with his payment. Uh I have to

[1:13:31]
an issue with his payment. Uh I have to
pay 25 people every month. There there
there is that that day where I receive
25 emails who are uh I have an
assistant. So they will send me all of
all the emails at the same time but
still I have to read them. So everyone

[1:13:45]
still I have to read them. So everyone
has a request. I changed my bank
account. Can you please send me money?
Not here but there. Uh things like that,
you know.
Um so
uh I think I learned that it is very
important to separate uh your days

[1:14:03]
important to separate uh your days
between management days and maker
days. And then on top of that you create
seasons. And then on top of that erh and
this is the this is my main goal this

[1:14:15]
this is the this is my main goal this
year. So I finished h last December my
sponsorship uh with poker stars and this
year uh I decided to spend more time on
my business. So it becomes uh a business
that can run itself

[1:14:32]
that can run itself
uh based on systems based on uh people
who have responsibilities to make
everything go well. uh having more
teachers uh professionals who are active
playing games, who are act active
playing spin and go, who are active uh

[1:14:46]
playing spin and go, who are active uh
playing tournaments. Uh so the the poker
school does not need need me uh creating
the content as more more people involved
in the project that makes it uh
stronger. It doesn't rely on me.

[1:15:02]
stronger. It doesn't rely on me.
So uh this year I decided this is the
the season that the following months are
going to be the the season of creating
these systems that I didn't have time to
create before because I was so busy

[1:15:15]
create before because I was so busy
doing so many things and the lack of
these systems led to many people
interrupting my life at all times
because they needed uh whatever and also
that led to uh me having to learn many

[1:15:31]
that led to uh me having to learn many
things. I you know I I I learn a lot of
things about design. I I know a lot of
things about the psychology of a
thumbnail on YouTube. I learned a lot of
things about the the the psychology of a

[1:15:46]
things about the the the psychology of a
good title for a YouTube video. I I I
have a list of 20 questions you make to
you need to make yourself and the title
for the title to work on YouTube. So I
know what things
uh so I need I know how to apply

[1:16:02]
uh so I need I know how to apply
pressure uh to to a
decision to make sure it survive all
that um all that process all that system
and if it survive that system it it

[1:16:15]
and if it survive that system it it
means the video will get over 200k
views. Uh
so there is there is a lot that I
learned uh during the past seven years.
Those things should assist in a system a

[1:16:31]
Those things should assist in a system a
system
that you delegate on someone and you
give them that
responsibility and I have been doing
this for for years but there is a lot so
it's like uh it's something that you

[1:16:46]
it's like uh it's something that you
need to continue doing as new things
happen as you create new new new things
uh for example about 13 12 months ago I
created a news department. So I have a

[1:17:00]
created a news department. So I have a
uh two two guys creating news every day.
One in video, one in uh written format
and I have uh editors who are
specialized on creating that kind of
content and it's going great. We are
getting like 50k views a day or per per

[1:17:16]
getting like 50k views a day or per per
video per day or more in news content,
news poker content. Uh and then uh we um
so by doing that we could create a
system uh that leads people to visit the

[1:17:31]
system uh that leads people to visit the
website uh
thspoker.com because you announce uh
things on those news um platforms that
you created on Instagram and and
YouTube. Uh so that led to new new

[1:17:46]
YouTube. Uh so that led to new new
things you need to think about.
So entrepreneurship um I'm learning that
it it is a lot of
understanding, delegating, creating

[1:18:01]
understanding, delegating, creating
systems. I I feel I neglected this part
of entrepreneurship the last uh six
seven years. Uh so I decided that I need
to have a stronger business. So I don't

[1:18:15]
to have a stronger business. So I don't
rely on sponsors
uh for anything. I can just grow my
team. H I have 600k 700k
erh dollars that I need to spend on
people every year. I better make sure I

[1:18:30]
people every year. I better make sure I
can pay for it. Uh first of all, without
help and
then I will have the freedom to to do
two months of snowboarding and traveling
through Japan and it will be fine,

[1:18:45]
through Japan and it will be fine,
right? But if you have the pressure of
all these people rely on me, I I I'm not
so sure things are going to go as they
should because I'm just busy uh playing
poker or traveling or doing whatever.

[1:19:01]
poker or traveling or doing whatever.
Uh this I I I decided this is the year
of uh or the season of learning more
about entrepreneurship. So I'm uh
studying more about systems and and
studying more about having about

[1:19:17]
studying more about having about
learning how to delegate correctly and
so many other things.
Uh so yeah and then uh it will be easier
to be a poker player after I do
that basically. Yeah, I could see your

[1:19:32]
that basically. Yeah, I could see your
passion there for learning systems and
how to delegate and your mind going away
with all the ideas that you need to uh
to implement on but al also like the
real like problems you're trying to
solve. You're basically trying to grow
business, make it sustainable, make it

[1:19:45]
business, make it sustainable, make it
profitable and then have a life on the
side which you can actually do not
carefree but without like 25 people
relying on you every day for for your
input. So it's it's growing something
whilst also keeping that freedom. So
yeah, I think it'd be quite interesting
to try and relay this to poker players

[1:20:01]
to try and relay this to poker players
because as you mentioned, this is one of
the one of the skills poker doesn't
teach you is how to delegate and how to
create systems. You end up being like a
a solo guy just doing your own thing and
trying to you against the world
mentality. So that's let's think about
in terms of the maker and the management
side. So I guess for the maker, the

[1:20:15]
side. So I guess for the maker, the
poker player will be the creative stuff
which going to be the studying probably
grinding would go into the their maker
time and then management. So all of us
have a life to manage so to speak for a
poker player. It's kind of easy. No
offense poker players, but it's kind of
easy um because there's not that many
things that you need to manage other

[1:20:30]
things that you need to manage other
than yourself. So, how would you think
about it? Let's say we could go back to
your early career and we could implant
this systems delegation kind of mindset
towards your early port career. What
would be some of the uh early choices
you would make to create some systems
that would allow you to optimize your

[1:20:46]
that would allow you to optimize your
port career? I always thought that
sleeping is so important even today that
I would never and it it was one of my
early desires becoming a poker player. I
want to control my schedule, my working
schedule. That means I work until

[1:21:01]
schedule. That means I work until
whatever time I want to work and I wake
up at whatever time I want to wake up
and then life continues. Uh so I would
say that whatever I do I would keep I
would give myself that freedom to sleep
as much as much as I feel I need and one

[1:21:17]
as much as much as I feel I need and one
of the things I learned also studying
performance and things like this is how
important sleep is. Uh so I I would put
a huge priority on sleep. Uh, one of the

[1:21:30]
a huge priority on sleep. Uh, one of the
things I do now that I didn't know were
as important
before are things related with uh,
avoiding heavy meals, avoiding high carb
diets that would lead to you feeling

[1:21:45]
diets that would lead to you feeling
like you want to sleep two hours after
you finish eating.
Uh so I I certainly became
uh fairly decent at at managing the way
I eat. Uh I would say the the part where

[1:22:04]
I eat. Uh I would say the the part where
I could become more efficient is
spending less time in
the in the planning you know creating
systems to eat healthy but not spend a
lot of

[1:22:15]
lot of
time creating the healthy situation. Uh
so that's that's where some efficiency
could come and I realize now how
important it was to be available
full-time to just focus on poker when I
was in my early career. uh and also

[1:22:31]
was in my early career. uh and also
especially because at the beginning you
have this drive that you can spend all
your time thinking about poker all the
time. Uh later on this uh dries a bit.
So you would you are less likely to want
to spend 12 hours per day thinking about

[1:22:45]
to spend 12 hours per day thinking about
poker but at least you want to make sure
you can sustain eight or 10 uh in the
working days you put into poker. Uh so
uh diet uh would be a thing I I I I I

[1:23:00]
uh diet uh would be a thing I I I I I
think would matter. I never the part
where I am not good uh it is at uh
the training part uh physical training
uh going to the gym and and these
things. I always uh felt uh that going

[1:23:18]
things. I always uh felt uh that going
to the gym would be negative for my
poker career. uh because the time I
would have to put to go there to be
there and to come back it would be like
two three hours that I could not use for

[1:23:31]
two three hours that I could not use for
poker.
Um today uh I changed my approach uh to
that. So every day when I wake up I will
walk 4 kilometers. It's the first thing
I do. I walk I go to a coffee shop that
is very very far from my house and then
I come back. So I I I I do that uh every

[1:23:48]
I come back. So I I I I do that uh every
day.
Um would I want that uh in my early
poker career? I am not sure.
Um I am not sure because certainly it

[1:24:00]
Um I am not sure because certainly it
takes time. It will take away the first
two hours of my day. Um or an hour and a
half. Uh but uh maybe I can put some
efficiency in there and just do that
thing running and take 30 minutes or

[1:24:15]
thing running and take 30 minutes or
something and then my day starts. So
certainly maybe there is a way to to put
it in there and and it would be good. Uh
now I am caring more about those things
because I am in a good place in life. So

[1:24:30]
because I am in a good place in life. So
what matters the most right now that I
have a property, I have a life.
Um it matters to be healthy, right? So
it is a change. When you are 20 you are

[1:24:45]
it is a change. When you are 20 you are
not thinking so much about those things
but when you become become older you you
think more about those still I you can
tell at 20 year old you should work out
he maybe he will listen maybe he will
not

[1:25:01]
not
right I I I think those things
uh you know most of the people I knew uh
work out when I was 20 25 people around
me are people who were working out
because they are interested in meeting

[1:25:16]
because they are interested in meeting
girls, uh going to parties, uh picking
up and all these
things. Is this good this good for your
poker career? Certainly not. No, it's
better to be a a lonely lonely
[ __ ] just to be at home, just work. H

[1:25:35]
[ __ ] just to be at home, just work. H
So,
uh these things are very difficult. Erh
probably it matters way more the way you
were raised as a kid, right? What kind

[1:25:45]
were raised as a kid, right? What kind
of habits you had when you were growing
up compared to um just saying to to
someone do this and life will be better
for you. H I'm not sure people will
listen when they're 20 20 25 uh they
will just do whatever they feel they

[1:26:00]
will just do whatever they feel they
need to do. Um, I think the what matters
the most is having that
drive and in my case that that was
driven by a lot of pain and just pure
fear. Like my life before this was so

[1:26:16]
fear. Like my life before this was so
[ __ ] I don't want to go back to that no
matter what, you know. But I'm not
scared of that anymore. I I know I'm
going to be just fine. Uh so it's
impossible that I am going to become
bankrupt or something like that anytime

[1:26:31]
bankrupt or something like that anytime
soon. Uh so that that fear doesn't
exist. Um when you are 2025 maybe you do
have that that fear. What if I am not
able to become a professional poker
player? What if I need to find a job and

[1:26:47]
player? What if I need to find a job and
I hate it?
So that fear can be very powerful to
make you work and to give you
discipline. I was certainly avoid drugs.

[1:27:01]
discipline. I was certainly avoid drugs.
I I never I was never interested in
drugs. I was never interested in
alcohol. H I was never interested in
party because I those just those were
not things I was interested just that I

[1:27:15]
not things I was interested just that I
I didn't have fun when I was a teenager
with friends.
uh doing doing that. So as I grew up
those things didn't matter to me. So
that that made things easier. But uh at
the same time I was

[1:27:31]
the same time I was
uh I I have been always someone who is
just fine alone. I I I would enjoy
having friends with me and uh and I do
enjoy it a lot now. But at the time
didn't matter as much. That means you

[1:27:47]
didn't matter as much. That means you
shouldn't have friends when you are 20
25. If you want to have a good poker
career, I think it matters that you feel
in balance. If you feel good about your
life, everything is fine. Don't worry
too much about it. If you feel lonely,

[1:28:01]
too much about it. If you feel lonely,
maybe you should do something uh to feel
less lonely. Uh
but basically, the more hours you can
put into work, the better for for your
poker career. uh as long as those hours

[1:28:15]
poker career. uh as long as those hours
are quality
hours. You know, one thing I did that
wasn't very good, it is that sometimes I
would
uh have distractions around me uh like a
TV show I like or something uh meanwhile

[1:28:30]
TV show I like or something uh meanwhile
I was in the computer. So that would be
one thing I would try to avoid. But that
only happened after maybe I was in this
uh this happened to me when I was doing
the supernovit. I had to play so many
hours every day. So playing 12 hours per

[1:28:45]
hours every day. So playing 12 hours per
day every day at some point it it it it
just feels uh you you need something to
change around you. You you want the
radio whatever. Obviously it's not good
to have that distraction while you are
playing. But if you are putting so many

[1:29:01]
playing. But if you are putting so many
hours into poker and and you're playing
for a goal that it is rackback related,
uh it didn't change too much the I mean
change the outcome obviously of of your
performance. Uh doesn't mean I I I was

[1:29:17]
performance. Uh doesn't mean I I I was
in a very bad place because I did that.
No, I just made a bit less money
compared to what I would have been able
to to make.
So to any um young professional poker
player, I I

[1:29:30]
player, I I
think just make uh decisions
related with feeling fine, just fine. Uh
try to not do anything that will make
you
unhealthy. Uh because that that's just

[1:29:47]
unhealthy. Uh because that that's just
not good. And that is going to affect
your ability to to become good at poker.
And maybe you might die. And what was
the [ __ ] point of getting cancer
because you eat a lot of sugar? And and

[1:30:00]
because you eat a lot of sugar? And and
then what was the effort
for? What's the what was the [ __ ]
point? Uh if you are just dead because
of your unhealthy habits. Uh so you just
don't see the you just don't have the

[1:30:16]
don't see the you just don't have the
fear sometimes that you are doing
something that is clearly wrong. But I
think it's good to have some basic
knowledge of what is good or bad for
you. Find some some sort of balance. Uh
try to become efficient with your time.

[1:30:30]
try to become efficient with your time.
I think that's a good one. Uh because I
even today I find myself
uh making decisions that are not the
most efficient uh with my time. If I
want to put more hours into work, I
could. But this particular year I am

[1:30:46]
could. But this particular year I am
actually doing an active effort to feel
more relaxed because I I was having some
some one of the effects of doing so many
things at the same time it it creates
anxiety. It stress your body a lot. So,

[1:31:01]
anxiety. It stress your body a lot. So,
uh, the last year I was having issues
with my hands shaking. Um, I was I would
have
uh like a needle feeling, you know, like
a something in my heart that was weird.

[1:31:17]
a something in my heart that was weird.
Uh, like a needle. Uh, it it was
anxiety. Uh, I I would dream and I would
grind my teeth against each other.
erh without noticing is anxiety. Yeah,

[1:31:33]
erh without noticing is anxiety. Yeah,
anxiety was uh was there also one bad
thing that happened to me the last year.
It is that I didn't know that I had
um chronic rhinitis.

[1:31:46]
um chronic rhinitis.
Uh it is that the the inside the nose um
there are a couple of
uh things uh that were too big and don't
allow me to breathe properly. Uh so that

[1:32:01]
allow me to breathe properly. Uh so that
issue became bigger and at some point I
could not breathe very very
well
and and I develop a bad pattern of
breathing. I stopped using my diaphragm

[1:32:17]
breathing. I stopped using my diaphragm
and that led
to activation of my anxiety. Uh because
when you over breathe you you activate
the I think it's called the sympatic

[1:32:30]
the I think it's called the sympatic
system of your body. Uh so then it it it
activates the flight the fight or the
fight response of the of the body. So
this year is big for me to reduce
anxiety because now I don't need to go
to life events at least for now and this

[1:32:46]
to life events at least for now and this
is one of the reasons I want to focus on
making my business
uh independent to be making a business
that is able to run itself that has
everything it needs to be self uh
sustainable. So then next year if I want

[1:33:01]
sustainable. So then next year if I want
to be a poker player I can be a poker
player and a content creator at the same
time. But just that because in the past
eight years I I tried to do many things
at the same time. Uh learning a new
game moving up stakes to play high

[1:33:17]
game moving up stakes to play high
stakes in poker tournaments. Uh having a
business uh being a content creator,
growing my company from one, two, three
people to 25

[1:33:30]
people to 25
people. So many things were happening at
the same time. and in the and since 2023
also on top of that I added having an
sponsor and responsibilities as an
ambassador of a poker brand. Uh so all

[1:33:45]
ambassador of a poker brand. Uh so all
those things combined led to great
anxiety. Uh so for me at least this year
it is a priority to care a bit less uh
about things in general and this is why
I wake up and I walk 2
hours then my life continues after that

[1:34:02]
hours then my life continues after that
and and it's just fine at least for now
and also I am thinking maybe I just this
is enough maybe I don't want to create
new businesses I will just focus on
making this one great it will be [ __ ]
great I will work very hard on it then

[1:34:16]
great I will work very hard on it then
maybe this is
H because maybe I'm not built for this.
Uh my my mentality is not the right one
for this or my my desires in life uh of
making great content and being a good

[1:34:31]
making great content and being a good
poker
player. Uh I I will be able to
accomplish those things more easily if I
don't put more things
uh on the table. Big shout out to our

further ado, let's continue chatting
with today's guest, Alias. Yeah, well,

[1:36:00]
with today's guest, Alias. Yeah, well,
thanks for sharing all that. And I think
it's kind of a reminder through your own
experiences how hard it is to juggle
multiple things and kind of the hidden
cost of that when you're trying to do a
lot of things at once. This inbuilt
stress and pressure that can build and
often like there's a internal call just
to go back to simplicity. It's almost

[1:36:16]
to go back to simplicity. It's almost
like complex versus simplicity. They
often go back and forth and I feel like
for you we've got the point where
simplicity makes more sense or feels
like what you're gravitating towards now
and trying to create systems for that.
Then maybe from that place of simplicity
you go into more projects or juggle more

[1:36:30]
you go into more projects or juggle more
things. But yeah, I think it's always
always good to go back to that baseline
and as you mentioned with that kind of
anxiety episode you went through, it
really reminds you how much health
matters and how much looking after
yourself is a a really important
variable. So I just want to bring it
back to exactly what you said there
because you covered so many good things

[1:36:45]
because you covered so many good things
that I wanted to kind of I was writing
down frantically to cover in terms of a
pocket player and how to think about
systems and think about organizing their
kind of days in life. And the first one
or the kind of overarching one was
having a drive like a drive to want to
succeed. I think you mentioned for your
career, poker is the only thing that

[1:37:01]
career, poker is the only thing that
matters. That was like the internal
blueprints that you've had for a long
time in poker and whether it's to run
away from the life you don't want or
it's to create the life you do want
doesn't really matter but you need that
kind of drive energy almost like liftoff
energy to get you going. The next thing
you mentioned was protecting time. So

[1:37:16]
you mentioned was protecting time. So
how much time do you want to put into
pocket? Is it 8 hours, 10 hours, 12
hours? That gets locked in. You protect
that at all cost. Then the next things
you went into were performance and kind
of health related um yeah markers in
terms of sleep, in terms of diet, in
terms of exercise and making sure you're

[1:37:30]
terms of exercise and making sure you're
doing them as well as possible, but also
efficiently with time. Like as you said,
as a pocket player, maybe going to the
gym for two hours isn't going to work,
but a walk could work or a 15-minute run
might work. So balancing performance and
health measures with time efficiency,
especially when you're young and you can
kind of take a few bad choices around

[1:37:45]
kind of take a few bad choices around
health and and get away with it. Then
from that systems like systems around
that which I guess goes into habits,
routines, how you're showing up, how
you're preparing yourself and making
sure that's optimized. And then the last
thing you mentioned was kind of avoiding
distractions. And I related to what you
said. I did civil over for three years

[1:38:00]
said. I did civil over for three years
myself. It is monotonous. It is like 10
hour 12 hour days. It is boring. It is
clicking buttons for a long period of
time. And yes, there's periods of the
day which are great. There's periods of
day where you're like, I'm bought up my
mind, but you're against the kind of
volume clock every single day. There's
no letting off from January 1st. For me,

[1:38:15]
no letting off from January 1st. For me,
I used to finish on December 30th, so it
was a a full year of planned out volume.
So, I can relate to that. Wanted to
spice things up. I used to listen to
podcasts and some music, something just
to give my brain some novelty. So, yeah,
I can I can definitely relate to that.
So, I want to bring the conversation
around to a bit more lifestyle stuff and

[1:38:31]
around to a bit more lifestyle stuff and
especially thinking about environments
and travel because I know for yourself,
you've lived in so many different places
for various different reasons. So, I
want to dive into uh the kind of pros
and cons of the travel you do. So, for
you, you've lived many places. is I
think you've got a current base in Japan

[1:38:46]
think you've got a current base in Japan
in Andor in Korea. How much has your
traveling been to optimize your
lifestyle and how much has been to uh
focus on work or work related projects?
You know the reason why I started

[1:39:00]
You know the reason why I started
traveling in the first place it is
because in 2012 the Spanish government
closed the market uh so you could not
compete against everyone around the
world. Uh so they created uh poker
stars. ES uh platform uh

[1:39:17]
stars. ES uh platform uh
and and they also the the tax
authorities in in Spain at the time they
were uh unfairly
[Music]
uh pursuing actions against poker

[1:39:31]
uh pursuing actions against poker
players asking for asking them for way
more money than what they ever made
because they were they didn't understand
the difference between
gross and and net income. So they they

[1:39:46]
gross and and net income. So they they
they thought okay this guy have this
this mob website it says you want
millions where are the millions and and
their millions were not there you know
because those were gross gross uh
profits not net uh profits. Uh so a lot

[1:40:04]
profits not net uh profits. Uh so a lot
of people uh got their life ruined by
that by by that
stupidity and and I learned that I could
not trust my government uh at that time

[1:40:17]
not trust my government uh at that time
because if that stupidity was allowed to
happen and it
was it was not a stop it just continue
uh I I I lost all faith in the system.

[1:40:31]
uh I I I lost all faith in the system.
So for me uh going to new countries as a
professional poker
player poker was the key of the freedom
for me. Uh going to new countries was
the the option I could take to remove

[1:40:45]
the the option I could take to remove
myself from uh my country. So I would
not have any issue uh making
money. So first I I traveled to the UK.
I spent a year there making the
supernovalit with a friend I was living

[1:41:01]
supernovalit with a friend I was living
with housemate I don't know anyway he
told me Thailand was great he had a
great experience living in Thailand so
we moved to Thailand together uh with
another friend and and and then I moved

[1:41:16]
another friend and and and then I moved
to the Philippines I met a a Korean uh
girl I moved with her later on to
Australia uh before the before They they
closed the market to uh Macau Life Poker

[1:41:30]
closed the market to uh Macau Life Poker
Japan. H oh I heard this site called
Bodo. It has great action in 2K. I moved
to Canada. I open a bank account. I play
Bodo in Canada for a few months every
year. Uh so I started making all these

[1:41:45]
year. Uh so I started making all these
uh uh trips and and going to different
countries complet being completely
honest with you that was not a good
decision for performance or for having a
good career. Uh having to travel is a
distraction. Having having to set up

[1:42:01]
distraction. Having having to set up
your life in a place is not a good
thing. It's a huge
distraction. But life was more fun that
way.
And if I had to change, I mean, if I
wanted to become the number one poker

[1:42:17]
wanted to become the number one poker
player in the world, would I repeat
that? Probably not. But what matters
more if tomorrow I go out and and a
brick falls from a ceiling of a random
building and hits my head and I'm dead.

[1:42:30]
building and hits my head and I'm dead.
What matters the most? The experiences.
The experiences I I had. Uh so for that
reason
uh I I feel those things uh were a good
thing in general for my life. Uh but

[1:42:47]
thing in general for my life. Uh but
those were those are risk you take. You
need to make sure uh you can survive
that you can make enough money to pay
for that kind of lifestyle. It was just
going with the flow. I I think at the

[1:43:01]
going with the flow. I I think at the
time I I was not thinking too much about
this is a performance choice. This is a
lif lifestyle choice and also I now that
I'm thinking about it I think I was
looking for a new
home. I you know I felt okay Spain is

[1:43:18]
home. I you know I felt okay Spain is
not my country anymore. I I know I'm not
going to ever going to come back to
Spain to live. So where do I live? Uh so
that was there. So I was actually
motivated too uh by that. I wanted to

[1:43:32]
motivated too uh by that. I wanted to
find a place where I felt okay maybe
this is the place where I will live and
the first place I
felt that it it was Japan.
Yeah, I think that's an amazing part of

[1:43:45]
Yeah, I think that's an amazing part of
traveling trying to figure out where you
would like to base yourself if you are
looking for a new location especially
when you're young and you can live the
traveler lifestyle with a little bit um
less responsibilities so to speak. Yes.
S what about Japan felt like a fit for
you? Why do you feel like you gravitated

[1:44:00]
you? Why do you feel like you gravitated
towards Japan?
It's a kind place. Everyone is kind. You
know, in Spain,
uh it can happen. doesn't mean it

[1:44:15]
uh it can happen. doesn't mean it
doesn't need to happen but it might
happen that somebody else for some
random reason ruins your
day brings negativity in your life
whatever it is it might happen uh these
things in Japan just don't happen it

[1:44:31]
things in Japan just don't happen it
it's pretty much impossible you go you
take a train it seems silent there is
nobody there screaming h the there is
not this homeless guy so doing some
random [ __ ] like in the streets of

[1:44:46]
random [ __ ] like in the streets of
Vancouver. Uh so uh Japan just feels
everything is fine, nice, everything is
super clean, food is food is delicious.
H

[1:45:01]
H
uh of course I know now because my my
wife is Japanese that Japanese culture
puts a lot of pressure on Japanese
people on how to behave. So there are c
certain aspects of uh

[1:45:15]
certain aspects of uh
Japanese culture that maybe I don't
fully agree with uh in a way but the
general style of how this society is
built
uh it works for me because I it it it's

[1:45:31]
uh it works for me because I it it it's
just a place that is kind to me and I
can be left
alone and and just be super happy about
everything. Uh you know, you are not
going to see a um it's very unlikely

[1:45:47]
going to see a um it's very unlikely
you're someone is going to be unkind to
you. Uh so that makes this
place so nice, you know, and everywhere
else you go, you you're going to see
uh bad things around you, you know,

[1:46:01]
uh bad things around you, you know,
like, okay, this country has a homeless
problem. H this country is very dirty.
or or this country Australia is way too
far from Europe. Uh 30 hour airplanes.

[1:46:15]
far from Europe. Uh 30 hour airplanes.
Okay. One time, not often, please. Uh
so, so you see the the the good and the
bad side of many places, right?
Thailand, Macau, these are good places
in some way, but places in in other

[1:46:30]
in some way, but places in in other
ways. Uh Japan just has just has a very
good balance. Uh the issue issue with
Japan it is that coming as a tourist is
very expensive and the longer I was here
uh particularly in 2020

[1:46:46]
uh particularly in 2020
20 prices starting started to go very
high for rent and there are two uh
markets for renting an uh apartments. uh
one market for the residents, those who

[1:47:01]
one market for the residents, those who
have a blue car and are able to work in
the country and those who are just
tourist and I was just a tourist. Uh
so basically 85 90% of the market for
renting it was not available for me

[1:47:16]
renting it was not available for me
because I was not a resident. So those
who are tourists will have to pay for
rent 4K a month uh for a 60 square meter
apartment in Tokyo uh which is very
expensive. Uh so h I that motivated me

[1:47:32]
expensive. Uh so h I that motivated me
to buy a house in Tokyo so I could come
to a place that is mine uh fully mine
and I learned that it was it was
actually easy to buy property in Japan
and you could hire a company so they
receive your mail and you don't need to

[1:47:47]
receive your mail and you don't need to
do anything. They manage everything.
They put the bank account. You just send
money to the bank account and they
manage everything and everything is
fine. And you go through the process of
buying a house and all the system is
built for bad things not to happen. Uh

[1:48:01]
built for bad things not to happen. Uh
you know, you feel transparency. They
explain to you. So I have documents
about what's behind every wall of my
house. You know, uh those things don't
happen in other countries. So the is you

[1:48:17]
happen in other countries. So the is you
know Japanese seek perfection in a way
and maybe it it also
um translates to met expectations in a
way. I don't know. Yeah. But it seems

[1:48:31]
way. I don't know. Yeah. But it seems
like it aligned with some of the things
you value, some of the things that you
like from a society as a whole, but also
like the culture of being friendly,
being kind, everything transparent seem
to really resonate with you. And yeah, I
really like that you've obviously done a
lot of traveling as well to arrive at

[1:48:45]
lot of traveling as well to arrive at
that conclusion. Most people haven't
traveled the world enough to know what
cultures would fit. You kind of get
indoctrinated in your own culture and
then you kind of maybe stretch out a
little bit, but yeah, all of us live in
different countries to where we were
born and I think a lot of poker players
have opportunities to travel to see the

[1:49:01]
have opportunities to travel to see the
world. Yeah. As you mentioned though,
one of the challenges is with travel is
that how do you keep performing at a
high level whilst you're going to new
places? So, you've obviously done this a
lot and I'm sure there's been some bad
experiences and some good ones. But what
are some of the things you've learned

[1:49:15]
are some of the things you've learned
about travel hacks, routines, and things
that are important when you're trying to
stay productive whilst traveling? Maybe
you're doing two months here, two months
there. There's an element of excitement
to go new places, but there's also an
underlying theme of I need to get stuff
done. I need to be productive. What are
some of the things that have been

[1:49:30]
some of the things that have been
important for you?
For most of the time I was traveling,
one of my first stops when I arrived in
a new country would be to go to IKEA and
buy the same table and the same chair
that I bought everywhere else. H I think

[1:49:47]
that I bought everywhere else. H I think
the the chair I think it was called
Marcus the the desk. I forgot but if I
sit on it I will
remember the the name of these furniture
things. Um so you you you try to find

[1:50:02]
things. Um so you you you try to find
find some level of efficiency in this
very unefficient life. Uh but yes you
you would uh rent an apartment. It would
be big enough for you to have a a space
where you would work. H uh actually

[1:50:17]
where you would work. H uh actually
going to Canada was was nice in a way
too at some point because uh Canada was
was one of the few countries where I
could spend uh six months per year.
Um, so that was easier. Uh, I mean you

[1:50:30]
Um, so that was easier. Uh, I mean you
you get more for for your money when you
go there. Uh, Japan would be painful
until I bought the house. Uh, but I just
loved it here. So I came back again and
again. There were so some countries

[1:50:45]
again. There were so some countries
where I would not go to play online. For
example, I I went to Macau for 3 months
that was live poker. Uh, so I didn't
need to care too much about uh anything
else besides going to the casino and
playing live
poker. And other countries I I I I went

[1:51:02]
poker. And other countries I I I I went
to live, I could stay up to one year. So
then I would just rent a place for one
year and it would be uh there for me. Uh
Australia also I got a one-year visa by
the way uh a working working holiday

[1:51:15]
the way uh a working working holiday
visa. And in 2018 I could get the same
visa in Japan. uh there is a visa for
people under 30 years old uh that allows
you to live for one year in Japan. So
that year I could get efficiency out of

[1:51:33]
that year I could get efficiency out of
uh my work and it was also the year that
uh my channel started to to do well
because I was combining this life in
Japan with h poker online and so on. Uh

[1:51:48]
Japan with h poker online and so on. Uh
so it was um good combination because uh
also Japan is a country that attract
attracts a lot of attention. It's a very
popular place compared to other
countries, right? Uh

[1:52:00]
countries, right? Uh
so so I I I just tried to to to combine
everything uh and find small
efficiencies in in a kind of an
efficient life. But there there were
certain decisions that would allow me to

[1:52:17]
certain decisions that would allow me to
uh keep a place. I would become friend
with the landlord of a place and I would
negotiate. Okay, I have 3 months here. H
I will leave for 3 months. Please keep
my chair and my table in your apartment

[1:52:31]
my chair and my table in your apartment
and when I come back I come here. So
that will help right? Uh so I come back
to a known place.
That's th those things.
Yeah, it sounds like trying to create
some sort of normality and kind of

[1:52:45]
some sort of normality and kind of
efficiency in that small environment
that you have, but also like obviously a
lot of things that you can't control in
terms of the new locations, figuring
stuff out. I always feel like when I get
to a new place, I always want to get in
a routine quite quickly. I want to
figure out where the supermarket is. I
want to figure out where the gym is. I

[1:53:01]
want to figure out where the gym is. I
want to try and get into a a similar
routine of what I've been on previously.
isn't always 100% possible, but I think
there's an element of what you know what
routine works for you over time. And the
more you can get back on that routine in
different places, the more you feel, ah,
I'm at home. Like you, the Marcus chair,
it's like the Marcus chair, this feels

[1:53:16]
it's like the Marcus chair, this feels
good back at home. Even though you're in
a different country, there's an element
of normality or um yes, something that
feels normal to you. Um yeah, so for you
in terms of the downside of traveling,
we've kind of mentioned the productivity
sides and yeah, kind of difficult to

[1:53:31]
sides and yeah, kind of difficult to
always Yeah. perform at a high level.
What are some of the downsides you've
experienced or some of the the darker
times of traveling? Because I know for
from the outside, you're someone who uh
plays a lot of poker, creates content,
travels the world. It can seem very
glamorous on the outside, but I know
there can be a lot of challenges on the

[1:53:46]
there can be a lot of challenges on the
inside. So for you, what were some of
the darker periods of of your travels?
I think the worst part was living a
place when you didn't want to
live. When you were comfortable in a
place with a life that you created and

[1:54:00]
place with a life that you created and
then you see that your visa is expiring
and you need to leave the I I remember
those moments are the mo as the most
annoying moments for sure. Yeah. So
getting evicted out of the country.
Yeah. Your visa expired.

[1:54:16]
Yeah. Your visa expired.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. uh
and in the past uh you know one thing I
I am doing right now is building what I
call bases. So for I'm lucky now that I
can afford to to do things I before I

[1:54:31]
can afford to to do things I before I
couldn't. Uh for example before I I
could not keep a place all year rented
uh in a country but now I can. So, for
example, I have uh a house in Korea that
I rented on a yearly basis uh with a

[1:54:47]
I rented on a yearly basis uh with a
much better price compared to what I was
paying before in Japan. But it's a place
that where where I have a a setup uh
where I where I have a computer uh
monitors, everything um lighting uh I

[1:55:02]
monitors, everything um lighting uh I
can create content there, I can study
poker there. Um, I I I have everything
uh prepared for me when I when I get
there and I know the place already. In
Japan, um, I was having some issues

[1:55:17]
Japan, um, I was having some issues
before uh, with the size of my apartment
because it's a first floor apartment, 55
square meter, 660 with the terras I
think. Not too big. So, living uh, with
my wife, it is way too small. on in on

[1:55:33]
my wife, it is way too small. on in on
in front of me. I have a lateral glass
door that allow me allows me to see the
living room and the kitchen. It's not
ideal. I I can get distracted easily by

[1:55:46]
ideal. I I can get distracted easily by
my wife uh living in front of me. Uh, so
this summer I I had the the opportunity
to to buy a another apartment in the
same building at a higher floor and I
have a I'm creating now uh another

[1:56:02]
have a I'm creating now uh another
studio where I can work with natural
lighting uh that I don't have in this
one and uh way more um separated from
the daily life of um everything else. Uh

[1:56:18]
the daily life of um everything else. Uh
so little by little I am building a
spaces in and Pandora. Uh I chose that
that country to become my my tax
resident. Uh so so I became tax resident
uh last year and I bought a house

[1:56:33]
uh last year and I bought a house
too. There is the first country where
where I could get a a mortgage uh based
on my business because as a poker player
you cannot get a mortgage but having a
business I could get a a mortgage. Uh so

[1:56:46]
business I could get a a mortgage. Uh so
so I am buying a a house and now I am
managing a reform. So I delegated
creating the space
um and I am managing that from overseas

[1:57:00]
um and I am managing that from overseas
and I have a consultant company with a
power of attorney so they can do
whatever it needs to happen for that
thing to to end.
So after all of this is done, uh I

[1:57:15]
So after all of this is done, uh I
basically can jump from country to
country, keep that kind of freedom I
used to have before in a more mature
way.
Uh that will lead to less uh
productivity issues. So that's where I

[1:57:31]
productivity issues. So that's where I
am at now.
But that was what I what I built with a
lot of effort before. Yeah. And a lot of
experience as well. A lot of kind of
figuring out what you want and then also
creating the situation where you could

[1:57:46]
creating the situation where you could
actually buy these bases, these home
bases. I like the the terminology there.
And yeah, it feels like now almost
you've got that the best of both worlds
because as you mentioned the downside of
travel is you're always in your places.
You've got to set up. It's cost effect
not cost effective always to uh rent
shortterm. So you found a way to travel,

[1:58:01]
shortterm. So you found a way to travel,
but also to have this kind of base where
you can be efficient. You've got
everything you need in those places. So
yeah, sounds like a very GTO way to
travel and especially the way you've
organized it now feels like a a much
less stress version, but also a much
more simple but actually efficient way

[1:58:17]
more simple but actually efficient way
to do it as well. Rene, for you, I know
you ended up in Malta for a long time.
What led to you to uh leave your home
country for Malta?
I mean, I've lived in Yeah. Malta and
Brazil. I would say have been the and

[1:58:30]
Brazil. I would say have been the and
then obviously the Netherlands have been
the main places that I've lived for a
longer period of time. Moved around some
cities. Um, I initially just started
traveling because, you know, that was
fun, right? We got freedom with poker.
Uh, Netherlands, very cool. So,

[1:58:45]
Uh, Netherlands, very cool. So,
especially in the winter, let's let's
get the hell out of there. And
especially in the beginning, you know,
it was just with some poker players
renting house in Malta, having fun. It
wasn't necessarily that professional,
but then especially if things are not
really going your way poker results
wise, you know, and I in general, I'm

[1:59:01]
wise, you know, and I in general, I'm
very easily distracted. I need like
routines for in order for my brain to
perform. I've found traveling all the
time became quite distracting. You get
internet problems. You don't know where
you don't have an apartment and you have

[1:59:15]
you don't have an apartment and you have
to leave your apartment in 3 days. Yeah.
How do how the hell do you expect to
perform well at the poker tables if all
these things are going on? So, I at some
point really started to crave like uh
like a how do you I guess certainty and
like routine and I I it wasn't really

[1:59:31]
like routine and I I it wasn't really
for it wasn't I couldn't really make it
work like traveling and all of
distracting and having a fun life and
also being very good at poker. So, I
kind of locked myself in a little bit at
one place in order to perform uh better.

[1:59:47]
one place in order to perform uh better.
I do think I can make it work if I do it
a longer periods of time. It sounds like
it is, you know, stayed for example at
one place for six months or one year,
that's fine. But if we're talking about
month-to-month basis or even two or
three months, that's just too short for
me. And nowadays, I just I just crave a

[2:00:02]
me. And nowadays, I just I just crave a
lot of Yeah. like certainty, a lot of a
lot of routine, a lot of repetition. I
like the same things, you know. I go to
the same place, I go to that I I like
routines, same things. I don't need a
lot of uh a lot of change. Um, listening

[2:00:18]
lot of uh a lot of change. Um, listening
listening to your story, um, Alias, it
sounded like, you know, in the
beginning, you're just someone who
didn't want the job, right? You you
liked playing poker. You like the
strategy aspect. It was it sounded like

[2:00:30]
strategy aspect. It was it sounded like
a very great period. Then you found
another passion which was YouTube that
had to be funded. So, you created zero
poker. You started to expand businesses
more and more and more and more. And it
sounds like now you kind of want to go
back to how things was where like I
heard this quote I think it was Horoszi

[2:00:46]
heard this quote I think it was Horoszi
who said that it's funny that in the
beginning you know we invest all our
time to try to make money and then later
what we do we try to invest all our
money to get back our time right and you
said that you wanted to get into poker
because you wanted to do what you want
to do instead of all the things that you

[2:01:01]
to do instead of all the things that you
had to do. Does it feel like maybe now
in in in all the businesses that you
built and all the things that you done
that you're kind of back to where you
didn't want to be? That you kind of have
to do a lot of things and you're trying
now trying to work back to where you

[2:01:17]
now trying to work back to where you
were basically in the beginning where
you could do things just because you
wanted
to. It is a
um so basically there was there was
never a perfect

[2:01:30]
never a perfect
situation at least when I started uh
also creating content because that
needed to be funded. So I'm not trying
to go back to just being a poker player
because I found a new passion and I want

[2:01:46]
because I found a new passion and I want
to do both things. But I have been
trying to do both things at the highest
level I can and doing by trying to to
accomplish those two things at the same
time. I found a lot of issues like how

[2:02:02]
time. I found a lot of issues like how
do you pay for it and how this this this
and when you make money here new issues
come up and so many things right h
so in a way you are right I'm trying to
go back to having more time but at the

[2:02:18]
go back to having more time but at the
same time I'm trying to go back to a
place where I have more time and I can
do the two things I want to do at the
highest level I can without the issues
around it. Yeah. So you've you've you've

[2:02:32]
around it. Yeah. So you've you've you've
been using all these years to eliminate
the issues and get yourself in a
position where you can do that but even
at a higher level, right? So this is
like a journey towards creating the life
that you'll be able to do everything

[2:02:45]
that you'll be able to do everything
that you want to do. And in order to do
that obviously it doesn't fall out of
the sky, right? In order to do that you
have to go through times where yeah you
have to you have to do things right. You
have to reply to that email of that guy
who wanted to change his bank account,
right? It's Yeah, it's something I I I

[2:03:02]
right? It's Yeah, it's something I I I
can hire
people, create systems and delegate
those uh things to other people to
manage. Uh it's just that uh you need to
create a system for every separate issue

[2:03:16]
create a system for every separate issue
that might happen in your life h in
relationship to your business to uh
YouTube or whatever else.
Um you know with age also come uh comes

[2:03:30]
um you know you start I I started
thinking more in 10 year 15 year chunks
of life. Uh so one of the things I'm
thinking lately is okay, you know, I'm
actually happy that I chose poker as a

[2:03:47]
actually happy that I chose poker as a
career because I can actually play poker
being 60 years old or 50 or 45.
Obviously uh you are more sharp maybe
when you are young and when you are just

[2:04:03]
when you are young and when you are just
uh on it, right?
But playing live poker the past two
years, I realized that there is a life
in poker that is not only online poker.

[2:04:16]
in poker that is not only online poker.
Uh and I actually did enjoy it a lot. I
I did enjoy playing all these high
roller tournaments, going to European
poker tours and and doing all these
traveling and combining that with
content. I found there a niche of

[2:04:31]
content. I found there a niche of
content that does very well and a kind
of lifestyle that is also
great if you don't do it all the time
obviously but a bit of your time. Uh so
I'm thinking now about things such as

[2:04:48]
I'm thinking now about things such as
maybe it's time to create a family,
maybe have a kid. uh maybe I should do
that trip doing a snowboarding in all
the mountains of Japan so I get this
experience and I make that great

[2:05:02]
experience and I make that great
content. uh so so I think about these
things
and obviously you don't you cannot do
everything you want uh and at the same
time
be in the hill I mean at the top of the

[2:05:17]
be in the hill I mean at the top of the
mountain of in every thing you do but
but I think about it and what is
the the most meaningful life I could
have from now

[2:05:30]
have from now
on where is that and can I actually uh
be uh a very very good high stakes poker
player in tournaments playing life poker
for
example and at the same time have a

[2:05:48]
example and at the same time have a
meaningful life having a family uh
having other
experiences and I think I think you can
actually because not everything is

[2:06:00]
actually because not everything is
battling against very strong players
There are tournaments where there are
recreationals in super high roller
tournaments and you don't need to play
those 12 months per year. Maybe you can
play those six months per year and you
can make time for everything. And maybe

[2:06:16]
can make time for everything. And maybe
I can take something from
entrepreneurship. You have there Elon
Musk with so many businesses and the guy
has 13 kids. How does he do it? There
must be a way, right? I I I I think uh

[2:06:31]
must be a way, right? I I I I think uh
so
um so I also see time going faster now.
I'm not sure if you experience this
feeling of I feel the day goes faster
now compared to when I was 20. I I feel

[2:06:47]
now compared to when I was 20. I I feel
the day has
uh 21 hours. I I don't know if I am the
only one feeling that way. But I also
know summers when you were in when you
were in the school felt also like 21

[2:07:00]
were in the school felt also like 21
hour days. Uh summers they happen so
fast, right? It was the fun times. H so
maybe I'm just having a good life and
this is why it feels it goes fast. I'm
not sure. Uh but I am at that point in

[2:07:15]
not sure. Uh but I am at that point in
life h where I am thinking about all of
these things. Uh maybe it's time to have
a family. Erh, I know I am getting
closer to having to having a self-
sustaining business that can pay for

[2:07:30]
sustaining business that can pay for
everything and I can do these things I
really wanted to do and pay for them and
get some important chunk of my time back
so I can do this and this and this and
at the same time I'm thinking

[2:07:45]
at the same time I'm thinking
um having that back maybe I don't need
to feel in a hurry all the time. So
that's a place where I am at right now.
I can relate to the to the hurry. I I

[2:08:00]
I can relate to the to the hurry. I I
was watching back some of your vlogs and
I could definitely relate to certain
things that you're like ah no I have to
sit down I want to finish this because
then if I finish this then you know I
will feel more at peace or then it's
more calm but then the next thing comes
you know and then I then I work on the
next thing and I want to work on it

[2:08:16]
next thing and I want to work on it
until it's done because I feel like you
know then like like I said but then in
the meantime I'm rushing and I heard
there was this quote that that said
something about rushing to your death or
something and then sometimes when I when
I feel myself hasty or trying to rush

[2:08:30]
I feel myself hasty or trying to rush
towards it. I'm like, wait, I'm rushing
towards my death. This is this is not
great. I have to slow down and just
appreciate the process, you know,
appreciate the little things that I can
that I can see. So, I try to remind
myself of that quote that really stuck
with me like, oh, I don't want to I
don't want to rush toward my debt,

[2:08:46]
don't want to rush toward my debt,
right? Why, you know, and and you feel
like it's sometimes also close. Oh, I
just have to do this thing. But before
you know it, you know, this thing that
you thought would take one month,
suddenly it's one year. And in that
path, other things come that takes
another year, another year, and before
you know it, you know, you rushed

[2:09:01]
you know it, you know, you rushed
through three three years of your life,
three precious years of your life,
right? Right. And especially like you
also said when you get older I do think
you look at time a bit a bit differently
because you know when I was 20 I didn't
think about you know how much time you
have left or you know whereas now

[2:09:16]
have left or you know whereas now
nowadays that I do have a family and you
get a bit older you become more
conscious of it. So I I definitely can
see that it feels like it's kind of
going faster but that's more because you
understand the value of it right and you
have more things so you understand the
value of time more. That's why I feel

[2:09:31]
value of time more. That's why I feel
like it it it goes faster because I
experienced the same thing.
What about you, Havam?
Yeah, I think there's a lot of factors,
but I relate to time going faster. As
you get older, I think as you're younger

[2:09:46]
you get older, I think as you're younger
as well, you're kind of cramming a lot
in. You're doing a lot of things. Your
time's really full of different
experiences. As you get older, you
become a bit more routine dominant, as
Rene was touching on. And then the
things it feels less of a because you
have less novel experiences. The time

[2:10:01]
have less novel experiences. The time
seems to pass a bit quicker. Uh, I think
that's what I can relate to because I
know when I'm doing lots of stuff and
I'm doing novel stuff, time seems to
slow down again. It's almost like you're
fitting lots of chunks, dopamine chunks,
into your days and time goes slowly. But
when you're on routines, I think often
it can uh make it go a bit faster. But

[2:10:17]
it can uh make it go a bit faster. But
also, I think when you're working
towards something, so like you've got
like a future goal you're really excited
about, you're in the moments, you're
trying to make progress towards,
sometimes like being caught up in what
you're doing can make time go very
slowly. I can picture like years of my

[2:10:30]
slowly. I can picture like years of my
university career or career was it a
career university studies where I was
just living with my best friends for
three years and every day was this
massive adventure and we was having fun
every day was just really immersed and
being present and those three years felt
like 10 years looking back because we
was always doing stuff whereas as we get

[2:10:46]
was always doing stuff whereas as we get
older we we project things more to the
future. We're working on the project 10
years in the future and we're tipping
chipping away at it. So yeah, my
experience has been when you're younger
you're fitting more in you're more in
the moment. that can make time go slower
and as we age we often end up more on
routines that makes it feel a bit slower

[2:11:01]
routines that makes it feel a bit slower
faster.
I wanted to uh it's interesting. I
wanted to touch on uh on about uh some
poker things. You mentioned that you
know you were traveling playing highix
MTS. I know for scoops W coups you know

[2:11:16]
MTS. I know for scoops W coups you know
you stream highix MTS. How serious are
you about competing in MTTS or is it
mainly uh the content and brand building
aspect about it that plays the bigger
role?

[2:11:30]
It's certainly not for building a brand.
So that's not it's uh first it comes
for I really like doing this. I really
like
playing good events and I really like uh

[2:11:47]
playing good events and I really like uh
creating content about it. It's both
things at the same time.
erh in relationship about how serious I
am uh to to

[2:12:00]
am uh to to
compete. I am working towards having the
most time available to actually be able
to to to study and
find edge uh in as many places as I can.

[2:12:19]
And I also think that I I I think that
maybe tournaments play a bit uh better
even than cash with my strengths in a

[2:12:32]
even than cash with my strengths in a
way. I I I feel that uh cash games is
uh more math based and and
I I like play situations sometimes in a

[2:12:48]
I I like play situations sometimes in a
more intuitive context uh way. So
tournaments is more about context. Erh
so if and I have been I I think I I am
way better at empa empathy empathy I

[2:13:02]
way better at empa empathy empathy I
think is the pronunciation uh compared
to
uh math. Uh so I'm more I'm
definitely logical thinker but I'm I I I

[2:13:17]
definitely logical thinker but I'm I I I
for example I was never good at math at
school. I I would struggle with math
stuff. Uh so I I I rely more on
uh intuitive uh thinking and and I think

[2:13:33]
uh intuitive uh thinking and and I think
uh that goes better with tournaments
compared to cash games. Do you have an
example of how this strength shows up in
for example tournaments or in in a hand
that you played?

[2:13:46]
that you played?
So basically in different phases of a
tournament you might want to completely
change the way you build a three range
based on uh if you are closer to a

[2:14:00]
based on uh if you are closer to a
bubble for example uh you want to reduce
the amount of times you can lose the
tournament. Uh so in cast games you if
you have a strong enough hand you you're
you're just going to three bet and
you're just going to uh balance that

[2:14:16]
you're just going to uh balance that
with enough laughs and you are just
going to uh do certain things in certain
boards uh in tournaments. Uh you can
make you can completely change your game
a bit in certain situations
uh to

[2:14:30]
uh to
uh reduce the chance or reduce the
amount of times you're going to get
busted. Uh so it is way more flexible uh
the the way you play and of course uh

[2:14:45]
the the way you play and of course uh
the same things that are
um that that matter in cash games do
matter in tournaments but uh context
change things more in tournaments
compared to cash games. So this is why I

[2:15:00]
compared to cash games. So this is why I
think uh that diversity of situations
play with my strengths a bit more uh
than than cash games. That's what I
think right now. Uh I might be wrong. I
don't know. Uh but uh I think uh from my

[2:15:17]
don't know. Uh but uh I think uh from my
experience
uh feeling uh you know thinking about
how I feel playing tournaments that's
what I kind of feel. I I see
myself in a safe place uh playing

[2:15:32]
myself in a safe place uh playing
tournaments in the long term for some
reason. No, I think also obviously
longevity wise and I feel like
especially live series, you know, it
gets it gets only bigger and bigger like
you said also in content it's easier to

[2:15:45]
you said also in content it's easier to
create a story around it. It it it draws
more views. So I think naturally it's a
it's a form of poker that's easier to
promote. And in the end, you know, if
you if it's easier to promote, it will
be easier to grow and and to be

[2:16:00]
be easier to grow and and to be
sustainable. Um, obviously you were kind
of forced into entities for the content
reason as well. What do you miss the
most about the cash
games? The way you can manage your time
playing cash games. For example, I am in
Japan right now and one of the worst

[2:16:17]
Japan right now and one of the worst
things about Japan is playing
tournaments in Japan itself. Uh because
uh tournaments start at midnight, 1:00
am, 2 am, and they last until 10:00 a.m.
Uh so it completely destroys your uh

[2:16:34]
Uh so it completely destroys your uh
life. I I know now seeing the light of
the day matters. Uh it matters. It
actually matters. Yeah, I was going to
say most entity players, they go to
Costa Rica or something. You know, the

[2:16:46]
Costa Rica or something. You know, the
Japan was definitely not not an optimal
decision in that regard.
Yeah, but when I came to Japan, I was
not yet uh so committed uh with playing
tournaments. I came here actually being
a cash game poker player. Uh but uh this

[2:17:02]
a cash game poker player. Uh but uh this
also plays in the seasonal aspect of my
the way I think. Uh sometimes I will
there will come a season where I have to
stream and I will make the active effort
of living that way for three weeks. Um

[2:17:16]
of living that way for three weeks. Um
but generally when I am in Japan I will
try to do other things such as uh
studying making content. Um so I I will
try to to to use the time where I am in

[2:17:30]
try to to to use the time where I am in
a a friendly country for streaming. This
is one of the reasons I I got the the
home base in in Andor because actually
in Andor I can stream well playing
tournaments uh or play tournaments but

[2:17:46]
tournaments uh or play tournaments but
uh not here and also because the last
two years I have been playing mostly
live tournaments not so much online I
play online but seasons
you mentioned uh studying you we've
talked a lot about systems how does your

[2:18:03]
talked a lot about systems how does your
study
routine look like when you're studying
for MTTS and trying to get better? How
do systems play in that? And how has
those those those study methods evolved

[2:18:15]
those those those study methods evolved
over the years? Obviously, you've been
in poker a long time.
So uh in what relates to pre-flop stuff
uh all the studying I have I have done
it uh it was uh based on first of all

[2:18:32]
it uh it was uh based on first of all
learning how to use moner solver and
then uh going through situations and
trying to understand okay see if the
open race range is this I should be
playing this kind of hands

[2:18:45]
playing this kind of hands
and and structure my my game in this
kind of
way and I tried to focus a lot on pre
flop game uh because it was my weaker um
part the weaker part of my game uh

[2:19:00]
part the weaker part of my game uh
moving on from uh cash games uh on on
what relates to post flop for sure there
are c certain uh things that you you
will change playing tournaments uh you
play a smaller uh stack port radius so

[2:19:16]
play a smaller uh stack port radius so
for example if you have a strong hand in
cas games and you're deep, you are
probably going to uh do three barreling
over bets on the turn. You're going to
make the pot bigger so you can uh put
the opponent in a situation where he

[2:19:31]
the opponent in a situation where he
might lose all the money. In
tournaments, sometimes you don't need to
do that. Uh so depending on the spot, uh
you might want to to change the way you
approach a situation. H maybe you you
have the the set and you you build the

[2:19:46]
have the the set and you you build the
pot in a way that in the turn you have
an SPR of one and then you step back and
you allow the the opponent to bluff you.
Uh things like that. So there are
certain uh situations where you're going
to change the way you play but then on

[2:20:03]
to change the way you play but then on
what relates to um to post flop you know
one good thing is that because I had to
create content uh for the poker school
uh to fund everything else I was doing
to create that content because I wanted

[2:20:16]
to create that content because I wanted
to make sure that it was right. I was
studying everything I was posting. All
the hands I I would
um post are hands I previously studied
and I decided what I wanted to talk

[2:20:30]
and I decided what I wanted to talk
about about that hand. So if in a video
there are 25 hands, 25 hands I deeply
studied before and I maybe spent two or
three hours studied studying for that
video. So I think I I feel my
understanding of uh post flop uh comes

[2:20:49]
understanding of uh post flop uh comes
mostly from cash games from what I knew
before from what I learned uh creating
content and going through my database
and everything I played before from also

[2:21:01]
and everything I played before from also
being curious about how the best players
play. So trying to uh to find histories
of good players and seeing what they do
and trying to uh understand why they are
doing the things they are they are
doing. So all of those things and also

[2:21:18]
doing. So all of those things and also
uh by playing uh also tournaments
knowing who is good what they do uh you
also adapt into the into the metag game
right uh so all of those things uh at

[2:21:31]
right uh so all of those things uh at
the same time I still need to put more
time into studying ICM for example I I I
think it's a it is a it is something I I
could learn more more of and I would

[2:21:45]
could learn more more of and I would
like to to create to create a season for
that this year. Also, uh I I think node
locking and creating a strategies based
on common leaks is something that um it
it became a thing right uh in the past

[2:22:01]
it became a thing right uh in the past
few years uh in cash games. if it is
something that
uh I didn't do uh enough of or I didn't
put my my time of of on that because I
didn't I didn't need to it didn't it

[2:22:16]
didn't I didn't need to it didn't it
wasn't a priority let's say so I feel
that's a that's uh that's something that
could deserve also a season of uh
studying uh so I see certain aspects of
of my game where I could uh uh spend a

[2:22:33]
of my game where I could uh uh spend a
good amount of time uh with
it's actually it's actually funny I had
this the good thing about being a coach
or content creator is that you can
combine what you want to do with kind of

[2:22:46]
combine what you want to do with kind of
what you have to do right I remember
when I I always really love strategy
right studying the game and I was like
ah I would just I wish someone could
just pay me to just always study the
game that's the only thing I want to do
I don't want to grind right and I was
like well if I start a CFP and if I'm

[2:23:02]
like well if I start a CFP and if I'm
basically the head coach of strategy,
all I can do is develop strategies and
have them play. They do the grinding, I
do the strategy, so they pay me to to
study poker. How amazing is that? And
like if you, for example, if you make
content, for example, ICM, you said if

[2:23:16]
content, for example, ICM, you said if
you spend a season on studying
ICM, you can basically get those hours
paid by translating that directly in a
course, you sell it on your on your
zerospoker.com. So they basically the
audience funds you you to study and it

[2:23:30]
audience funds you you to study and it
funds your interest. I thought I thought
it was a very interesting uh uh
interesting uh way of of looking there
are a lot of synergies. They can
basically pay for your pay pay for your
studying time. Um that's a synergy right
there. And and you can think also about

[2:23:46]
there. And and you can think also about
being able to find a sponsor for
example.
Uh it is the result of building things
that allow that to happen.
uh and content creation is a creation is

[2:24:01]
uh and content creation is a creation is
a huge enable enabler enable I don't
know how to enable but it open it opens
a lot of possibilities uh you know for
example for human resources for hiring
YouTube is a huge amazing tool so I I

[2:24:16]
YouTube is a huge amazing tool so I I
could find someone for something I I
will get 300 emails so you can be picky
trying to find the best uh possible uh
person for for the job.
So there are there are many ways

[2:24:31]
So there are there are many ways
where actually it is uh difficult to do
many things at the same time but in a
way if you can make it work there are
certain things that happen thanks to
that that are that that do have immense

[2:24:47]
that that are that that do have immense
value. You know, I I I think I heard
Elon Mus speaking about how valuable it
was for him to have a space company,
SpaceX, because the the the effort they
need to do to study materials for for

[2:25:03]
need to do to study materials for for
space resistant material uh light
materials because they want to spend
less less money on fuel to get the
rockets um moving up. uh that was very

[2:25:15]
rockets um moving up. uh that was very
valuable for him as knowledge that he
could put into Tesla for example.
uh so
the so there are
many so I think it's good to think when

[2:25:31]
many so I think it's good to think when
you do many things at the same time it's
very important to try to find the
learning experiences that you can get
from some things you are doing and apply
them to to others is the same thing you
were asking me how did poker help you uh

[2:25:47]
were asking me how did poker help you uh
with entrepreneurship or or with content
creation or how did this strategy game
you played as a
teenager helped you with poker. Uh I was
not experienced enough at the time when
I was a teenager to really use that

[2:26:02]
I was a teenager to really use that
properly but I I I know a bit more now.
Right. Uh it's very good to think about
uh your possibilities in that way. Try
to find synergies
and and and use your time wisely because

[2:26:19]
and and and use your time wisely because
there is a little bit of it. you've
built a a quite a reputation as a
educator in the poker space creating
courses, training material. I want to do
something uh a little fun here on the

[2:26:30]
something uh a little fun here on the
podcast. I wanted to design a little
mini course here live on the podcast. I
will give you five chapters. Okay. And
you're trying to help like low to midst
MT players try to move up the stakes.
So, which topics would you cover in

[2:26:45]
So, which topics would you cover in
these five chapters that would best help
low midstakes MTT players move up?
So are we speaking about players who
don't know anything about the game or
No, they're like usually I would say our
audience especially you know to these

[2:27:01]
audience especially you know to these
podcasts you know long long deep
conversations about people who listen to
our podcast are definitely already
serious serious players probably at
least semi-pro I would say the majority
they're taking it very seriously so like

[2:27:15]
they're taking it very seriously so like
low mid6 MT grinders
I think pre flop game. Uh you can get
most of it from uh GTO chart charts. Uh
and certainly you want to learn about uh

[2:27:32]
and certainly you want to learn about uh
situations where you want to completely
change your game uh based on the
situation based on the pubble.
Um I
think post flop game is the the place

[2:27:46]
think post flop game is the the place
where most uh tournament poker players
they have the most uh to get uh the the
most um the most how do I say it? The
most leaks. Yes. And they they can they

[2:28:01]
most leaks. Yes. And they they can they
can learn the most. It's the weaker
point uh in their in their games. Uh so
in my case uh for example it's not a
fair comparison because I didn't move up
stakes in tournaments

[2:28:15]
stakes in tournaments
uh in what relates to post flop game
because of how I studied post flop
because that I got that from cash games
right so uh the the way I learned uh
tournaments it it was a bit different
compared to the population uh for me it

[2:28:32]
compared to the population uh for me it
was more about okay let's learn what are
the differences in the stack ratios how
do I want to change my game a bit? But I
had the understanding already about how
do I want to play certain group of hands
in certain situations and where where do
I want to apply pressure where I don't

[2:28:47]
I want to apply pressure where I don't
and for me it was more about learning
the context uh of situations and and
trying to be out of trouble also because
in tournaments it matters a lot also

[2:29:00]
in tournaments it matters a lot also
being out of trouble.
And and what do you mean with that out
of trouble and how how can we stay out
of trouble?
So what I mean is that in a tournament
uh 15% of players are going to get into

[2:29:16]
uh 15% of players are going to get into
the money, right? So risking their life
in the tournament
uh for
the for the goal of just making chips is
not always worth it. So obviously you

[2:29:30]
not always worth it. So obviously you
want to make chips, you want to win
chips. uh because it matters in
relationship with survival but it's not
the only thing that matters. It matters
also to remain alive in the tournament.
So um as a cash game uh player, one of

[2:29:45]
So um as a cash game uh player, one of
the leaks I had when I got into
tournaments, it was thinking about
pretty much all situations as a
situation where okay, how do I get the
most chips out of out of this situation?
And many times the right decision was to

[2:30:03]
And many times the right decision was to
actually uh not get into trouble in the
first in the first place. So there are
certain certain ICM situations
uh where you are playing with bigger
stacks uh you have a lot a lot to lose,

[2:30:15]
stacks uh you have a lot a lot to lose,
not a lot to win. You might want to fold
this one uh and not play all the hands
that you would play in a cash game. Uh
so that's that's what I mean to be out
of trouble. uh reducing the amount of
times where you will risk your life in

[2:30:32]
times where you will risk your life in
the tournament. It can be a good thing,
but also when you get into trouble, you
don't want to you cannot be so weak that
everyone can um push you around and and
you will fall. Uh so so you also need to

[2:30:47]
you will fall. Uh so so you also need to
learn to be the one applying the
pressure most of the times and when you
are the one uh feeling the pressure you
need to learn to to call uh as well
obviously you cannot follow every time
so it matters a lot to be strong in

[2:31:02]
so it matters a lot to be strong in
those
situations
but sometimes is it is even more
important to get out of trouble because
you you didn't need to be there in the
first place. Uh so this is
um this is something that is a change a

[2:31:17]
um this is something that is a change a
bit in mentality uh compared to cash
games where you're looking for the
maximum EV possible even with I don't
know six for sweeted against a semi fish

[2:31:30]
know six for sweeted against a semi fish
in the hijack and you are in the cutoff
maybe it's not the time in a tournament
to get into that
situation if there there is ICM involved
or or whatever
And and this is a I think an overlooked

[2:31:46]
And and this is a I think an overlooked
uh topic in tournaments uh which is how
do I create myself the best chances of
survival and the best chances of uh
actually uh getting into the top three
of this tournament. uh when I started

[2:32:01]
of this tournament. uh when I started
playing tournaments, I would have this
uh I I didn't have this understanding u
like
I I do now a bit more. Um so I think
that's a that's a that's useful I guess.

[2:32:16]
that's a that's a that's useful I guess.
Uh learning what situations you have a
lot to lose, not a lot to win.
uh learning those spots in tournaments I
think is useful and it will lead to you
having higher chances of getting good

[2:32:30]
having higher chances of getting good
prices. It can be very frustrating when
you are not uh very good in tournaments
and
you rely
on a few days in the year where you will
actually make a good amount of money

[2:32:45]
actually make a good amount of money
because you in tournaments uh your life
is five, six, 10 days per year you make
a lot of money and most days you lose
and some days you you're break even. Uh
it also depends obviously in the fields
you play. It's not the same to play

[2:33:02]
you play. It's not the same to play
5,000 people tournaments compared to 50
thou 50 people or 60 people
tournaments but the lower stakes you
play I think actually it's a good idea
for most tournament poker players so
they rely less on l on luck to play

[2:33:17]
they rely less on l on luck to play
smaller fields uh to try uh not
necessarily the biggest poker site uh
but maybe uh multitable in the right
stakes in the right fields
um you know uh so I I think that can be

[2:33:32]
um you know uh so I I think that can be
also useful because in tournaments uh
sometimes you you find yourself playing
many different mistakes at least I find
myself also because when I was an
ambassador obviously I can only play on
poker stars and then I would open a 200

[2:33:45]
poker stars and then I would open a 200
buying tournament and a 5,000 buying
tournament at the same time so you don't
have that consistency in the by you are
playing h but uh for most people they
can they can have that consistency
playing multi-side Right. Uh and they

[2:34:00]
playing multi-side Right. Uh and they
can even find consistency playing uh the
same type of field.
Um so that's that. Uh and then I think
also uh focusing a bit uh after they
feel they they control uh decently the

[2:34:17]
feel they they control uh decently the
pre flop strategies. Um I I I think it
it pays off well to to study how you how
you should structure your game. uh in
what it relates to post flop.

[2:34:30]
what it relates to post flop.
All right. So we had uh pre flop then
you mentioned like the bubble and in
general right these type of context
consideration you mentioned post flop
and then especially the differences
between SPR right as in the tournament
phases SPR instead of learning all the

[2:34:45]
phases SPR instead of learning all the
stack sizes try to focus on like what
you did okay I know how to play 100 big
blinds what changes if I play 40 big
blinds and then what change if play 20
big blinds aka you're trying to
understand what does the impact of APR
have on strategies right and you then
try to apply that to the best of your uh

[2:35:02]
try to apply that to the best of your uh
capabilities. You then said staying out
of trouble. And then you talked a lot
about the trade-off, win versus losing.
And then last, you added like a little
bonus tip, right? This little six
chapter about uh I guess your grind
selection. I wanted to actually add

[2:35:15]
selection. I wanted to actually add
something to that. I think it's very
important to add maybe also smaller
field tournaments to your grind so you
get also more experience in final table
dynamics uh three-handed play heads up
play because if you're only playing big

[2:35:30]
play because if you're only playing big
feuds and like you said it's those five
to 10 times in a year where you know
this is the moment if you get there and
you don't have any experience of getting
there probably you know that will lack
and I think also from a like a mental
perspective celebrating wins you know

[2:35:45]
perspective celebrating wins you know
actually winning some tournaments a bit
more often can also gain you some
confidence and you know so you don't
stay like I'm I'm only losing. So I mean
I've never grinded tournaments but I can
imagine that for me personally that
would be uh that would definitely be a
big deal and maybe you would uh it would

[2:36:02]
big deal and maybe you would uh it would
cost you some EV purely on paper but I
feel like just the psychological aspect
and the experience that you gain of
playing more final tables should I think
uh increase your ROI in the long term.
Uh what is your favorite course that

[2:36:16]
Uh what is your favorite course that
you've ever
created? You've created class. I created
uh the I I would see say my favorite is
the the one I did analyzing uh hands for

[2:36:30]
the the one I did analyzing uh hands for
spots. So I was trying to make a video
for every line that could happen like
bet on single race spots on the button.
One video uh a lot a lot of videos. 100
videos a lot of videos. not like so you
were just you were just basically go

[2:36:45]
were just you were just basically go
going over hands that you played in all
lines.
Uh yes, but uh to be fair I while I was
doing so many things I created like
maybe 150 hours of that and and there
was a a lot more to to that I needed to

[2:37:02]
was a a lot more to to that I needed to
record. Uh so uh I end up uh hiring also
because also I it didn't felt right to
me to continue doing that content for
cash games after I stopped playing cash
games. So I wanted to hire someone for

[2:37:16]
games. So I wanted to hire someone for
for the job. Erh, I I I actually would
would say that my favorite teaching
content is uh content that mixes
articles, written articles because you
know as a coach writing an article about

[2:37:30]
know as a coach writing an article about
theory of the game, it really force you
to to use the maximum you have to offer
to find the right words to explain
something. Uh so I I
created at least in my pocket school a
100 pages of uh articles and theory and

[2:37:48]
100 pages of uh articles and theory and
and I need to create more of that. Uh so
I would like to focus on that because I
was I was doing a format of content that
I think is really nice which is article
plus video with a samples. So I explain

[2:38:01]
plus video with a samples. So I explain
the theory in a written format and then
a video attached to the article uh with
a lot of examples of that the theory
applied. Uh so
uh I I I also think uh in my experience

[2:38:17]
uh I I I also think uh in my experience
as a coach uh different people in
certain fa phases of uh their poker
career they do need different content.
So for example, when you are teaching
someone who is uh starting in poker, I

[2:38:32]
someone who is uh starting in poker, I
think the most valuable content that you
can give to them is sessions because uh
them seeing you play is the fastest way
uh for them to learn intuition

[2:38:46]
uh for them to learn intuition
uh to learn how to play uh situations
that happen way more often than
situations that happen less often. I
think is not effective to focus on
theory uh with uh people who are still

[2:39:00]
theory uh with uh people who are still
recreationals. Uh I think it's uh way
more effective to teach them s through
example. Uh so actually giving those
people a lot of hours of played
sessions, play and explain let's say uh
it works very well for them early in

[2:39:16]
it works very well for them early in
their careers while at the same time you
combine it with uh content that allows
them to understand what is going on uh
and and build a general understanding of
the game good enough. So you you can

[2:39:32]
the game good enough. So you you can
actually create uh content that uh is a
bit more complex after that. Uh so um in
my pocket school at least I'm trying to
structure uh the content. Um so this is

[2:39:48]
structure uh the content. Um so this is
something I want to do. Uh I'm working
on it now with my developers but I'm
working on because also people don't
like to go to your website and see many
courses. they don't like it because they
don't know which one they should they

[2:40:00]
don't know which one they should they
should watch first. Uh they don't like
it. Uh but certain courses do do have a
format, right? So a course of play and
explain is a format in itself. A course
that is written articles with video
samples is a format in itself. a course

[2:40:17]
samples is a format in itself. a course
that is I don't know analysis with hat
stuffs or a course that is I analyze I
filter my database and I find uh hands
in certain spots and I explain those

[2:40:31]
in certain spots and I explain those
spots. So all of these things are
different formats of uh teaching
content. All of them are
valuable but
uh there are differences and the people
who want to watch them are different and

[2:40:46]
who want to watch them are different and
they are in different phases of of their
career. Uh so I want to work on a system
where I could organize all that content
from
uh bottom to top let's say from the

[2:41:01]
uh bottom to top let's say from the
beginning you start here and then you go
up to this place. Uh so basically I I
call it uh organized learning. I I want
to call it that way or organized
learning. So if you are here start here

[2:41:15]
learning. So if you are here start here
and then you you go through everything
this way and you of course can still
filter the courses and go to whatever
place you want. Uh but I I I am working
on that on that uh uh this year. And

[2:41:30]
on that on that uh uh this year. And
also I think it's uh important uh as a
coach to explain uh why I am teach you
are teaching the way you are teaching
and and try to uh understand uh the the
needs of

[2:41:45]
needs of
the client let's say the player and
offer them what they are really needing
even if they don't know
it.
So, so yeah, uh I I need to work uh at

[2:42:00]
So, so yeah, uh I I need to work uh at
least uh in my case on more content uh
for the different formats of content
that we produce for different types of
players uh c a lot more content. So this
is why I am uh hiring uh good

[2:42:15]
is why I am uh hiring uh good
professionals uh to help me and and I
want to focus also in the things that I
am less likely to get help people who
will because I I I also think some poker
schools uh make the mistake of hiring

[2:42:31]
schools uh make the mistake of hiring
lowlevel people to teach low-level
players. So at least in my case when I
started in NL2 and L5 uh I felt that I
mean I I I was learning from from people
learning who were playing

[2:42:45]
learning who were playing
NL25. They were a bit higher than me.
Yes. And I could learn from them
certainly but it would be better to
learn from an LL 100 player who is
teaching you how to beat NL2, right?
They know more of the game. H so also I
think it's good if you can afford to pay

[2:43:01]
think it's good if you can afford to pay
for it to have uh teachers in your
school who are way above the level they
are teaching. Uh so so that's something
also I want to to to do but not always I

[2:43:15]
also I want to to to do but not always I
will be able to to find
uh an NL 200 or high stakes player
willing to teach to micro stakes player
players. H so in those situations uh I
will be the one doing it because it is

[2:43:30]
will be the one doing it because it is
my own business. So I care enough about
it to do it myself. So I will try to
create that uh that value for beginners
also I know that because I am a content
creator on YouTube and my audience grew

[2:43:45]
creator on YouTube and my audience grew
large. So I I I do have a lot of a lot
of beginners. So the base of my pocket
schools are mostly beginners and they
want to watch me mostly most of them. So
also I I think my time is more valuable
teaching them um in general. So um I I

[2:44:03]
teaching them um in general. So um I I
the kind of content that you cannot
delegate easily articles written
articles very difficult to delegate uh
or teaching to beginners things like
that uh those are the things I will be

[2:44:16]
that uh those are the things I will be
focusing most of my time on until those
uh pieces of content are completed. Then
look the day day by day uh day to day
the future of the school will be in

[2:44:30]
the future of the school will be in
hands of uh people creating advance
advanced content
uh live um streamings uh teaching
members and and events and things like
that. That's what I am thinking. Yeah,

[2:44:46]
that. That's what I am thinking. Yeah,
you touched on something that I
definitely think there's a big need in
the poker education market. This is
something that me and Adam, we tried
with our mechanics of poker program
because there's a lot of information out
there, right? And like you said, people
don't want to have a lot of things. So,
we just have one program, Mechanics of

[2:45:01]
we just have one program, Mechanics of
Poker program, which is a clear learning
path from beginning to end. We teach you
everything you need to know in order to
succeed in poker, just one place instead
of just like, oh, here's a video about
this, here's a video about this. If it's
all connected, right, and thought out,
it's way easier for the student to to

[2:45:16]
it's way easier for the student to to
follow, right? Whereas if for example
you have a run it once they say okay
join us you get 5,000 videos yeah okay
where do I start you know I'm sure some
individual videos they might be
interesting but also sometimes like

[2:45:30]
interesting but also sometimes like
what's missing is okay where is the base
right whereas in for example our program
I know what I explained earlier and I
know why I explained it there so I can
now talk about something else because
you've already seen that right so I feel
like that really improves the the
learning experience you talked about uh

[2:45:47]
learning experience you talked about uh
what content enables you to do, right?
We talked about the value of content.
Zero Smoker is now closing in on I think
500K subs on both channels, which is
obviously us huge, right? Massive brand.
What do you think is the biggest value

[2:46:00]
What do you think is the biggest value
of building a brand? I know I see some
poker players, you know, they suddenly,
you know, they start to open a YouTube
channel, start taking their Instagram
more serious because they do see some
value in it. What do you think is the
biggest value? maybe both more obvious

[2:46:15]
biggest value? maybe both more obvious
but also a bit more the not so obvious
values of uh building a brand for
yourself. I think uh building a brand is
something you should do for the right
reasons uh most of the times but I'm not

[2:46:31]
reasons uh most of the times but I'm not
sure if I am being a bit
um if I'm comparing myself to population
of I want to be I want to be content
creators. Um but for me creating content
come comes out of passion for actually

[2:46:47]
come comes out of passion for actually
creating content. I do like it. I do
enjoy it. I I enjoy the process of
making a better video with my team and
working together for that for that to
happen. And it is very rewarding uh when

[2:47:02]
happen. And it is very rewarding uh when
you uh make happy uh your audience and
and they are there for you because you
this they they
they spend a lot of time uh watching
you. So they do care about what you have

[2:47:16]
you. So they do care about what you have
to say
and whatever is going on with your life.
Of course I think uh it's important to
have a very healthy relationship. Uh so
there are certain things you want to
keep your distance. uh uh in my case for

[2:47:30]
keep your distance. uh uh in my case for
example family stuff things like that um
but uh but I I also think it's important
to become a content creator because you
have a a not at least if you want to be
successful because I think it's very
difficult to become successful if you

[2:47:45]
difficult to become successful if you
are not open uh to be yourself and to
share your real thoughts uh with with
your audience right you told me before
you realized when I was uh creating
videos explaining why I was doing
whatever playing against you, how you uh

[2:48:02]
whatever playing against you, how you uh
realized that I was actually open to
explaining my thinking process about
certain things. This was a difficult
decision uh because obviously you could
just say whatever random thing to keep

[2:48:17]
just say whatever random thing to keep
your your strategy to yourself or the
real reason why you do something to to
yourself. But I made the conscious
decision of being totally open with my
audience in everything I was doing.

[2:48:33]
Um, at the time being completely honest
with you, there was no strategy behind
that decision. It was just, okay, I'm
just going to do this because I feel
better creating content this way. Uh,

[2:48:45]
better creating content this way. Uh,
but now I think about it, I now I
learned a lot a lot about YouTube over
the years. I I do know now that if I
wasn't open, it is highly likely I would
not be where I am right now.
Um so building a brand very valuable,

[2:49:03]
Um so building a brand very valuable,
super valuable. A lot of opportunities
will come with it with with it.
Um, if you can have a good relationship
with an audience, you are not in bad

[2:49:15]
with an audience, you are not in bad
places in what relates to being in
dramas and [ __ ] [ __ ] like that. It's a
good thing.
Uh, but I I think you need to enjoy it.
I think it matters that you do enjoy it.

[2:49:33]
I know uh it's becoming a huge thing for
business owners to create a personal
brand. A huge thing because uh people
buy from people they know most of the

[2:49:45]
buy from people they know most of the
time. So that's a that's a powerful
thing.
But I I think some some business owners
come across as fake people a bit uh
because of how their intentions are

[2:50:00]
because of how their intentions are
clearly
uh there uh and people are they know you
know people are not dump they they know
what you are doing what you are trying
to do uh most of the time and if you are
able to hide it uh it's highly likely at

[2:50:15]
able to hide it uh it's highly likely at
some point they will find out and then
you're done because you are a fake
person And that's what you cannot be
right. So uh so you have to hide behind
your passion sort of
a bit. Yeah. I I think you need to do it

[2:50:31]
a bit. Yeah. I I think you need to do it
out of passion. Uh and if you build a
brand uh be be honest about the things
you don't want to talk about and why uh
even even if you are not saying what
those things are and but try to be
honest about something you know but I I

[2:50:47]
honest about something you know but I I
don't know if you want to build a
personal brand that you and you sell I
don't know vaccines for a random DC that
doesn't exist in the first place you are
a [ __ ] [ __ ] person so you have no

[2:51:00]
a [ __ ] [ __ ] person so you have no
business having a personal brand in the
first place. Obviously, you cannot speak
about anything you feel, anything you
are doing because everything is for a
bad reason. Right?
So, there will be that too, right?
People who try to create a personal
brand because they are they're in the

[2:51:16]
brand because they are they're in the
pursuit of money or whatever other
reason. Uh if you are selling a product,
you better care your product is good. If
you care about your product being good,
you can speak about that and you can
maybe try to build a brand around it.

[2:51:32]
maybe try to build a brand around it.
But you better have a reason to speak in
the first place, right? So I I think
that's also important, right? Also many
people try to build a YouTube channel
without
having anything to say at all. They're

[2:51:46]
having anything to say at all. They're
just there. Yes, I see this guy making
money making YouTube videos. I want to
do that too. Um in my case I I was
sharing my passion for poker and even
more important my passion for the way I
was living. Uh so there was a reason a

[2:52:01]
was living. Uh so there was a reason a
reason for that content to be there and
it happened to be something that was not
being made in the Spanish speaking
community. Um and the way we evolve the
content is also not

[2:52:15]
content is also not
the is very original. I will say there
are not many content creators doing that
kind of uh poker
content. So
um you need a reason to speak. People
need a reason to watch you. You better

[2:52:33]
need a reason to watch you. You better
find you better find those two reasons.
I think that's uh that's very valuable
advice like you already said
like a brand comes with various
opportunities, right? And especially in

[2:52:45]
opportunities, right? And especially in
poker, we look for different
opportunities uh both to grow.
Personally, if I speak for myself, like
one of the reasons why I started to do
other things is to grow in different
areas. And like you said, many
possibilities, opportunities come your

[2:53:00]
possibilities, opportunities come your
way. You don't know which ones those are
going to be, right? But I noticed that
as the brand goes bigger and as our
audience goes bigger, I get more emails
with people wanting to collaborate or
you know and you know maybe maybe nine
out of 10 times is nothing but sometimes
it's like hey that's pretty this pretty

[2:53:15]
it's like hey that's pretty this pretty
interesting otherwise would not have
come on your path which was actually one
of the big reasons why I started to
venture out and doing this kind of
things. I didn't have one specific thing
in mind but I figured like ah I'll
probably learn a bunch of things along
the road and who knows who knows what
will come right. Um now many players

[2:53:31]
will come right. Um now many players
they're interested you know in creating
multiple streams of income using this
brand. Um for
yourself how many different type of
streams of income do you currently have
in your business and which one do you
think is most rewarding? And I would

[2:53:46]
think is most rewarding? And I would
also actually be interested in like
which income stream do you think is a
pain in the ass and you would not
recommend people going for.
So, I guess I guess it ties in which
income stream you should expand to and
which income stream you should

[2:54:00]
which income stream you should
definitely not expand to based on your
experience.
What is your favorite poker hand?
My favorite poker hand?
Yeah. That I've ever played. You mean?
No. Your favorite poker hunt to play

[2:54:16]
No. Your favorite poker hunt to play
with? Pre flop? Oh, five for suited man.
Spades.
No, you don't prefer aces. No, that
that's an answer to that all out. In my
streams and in my content, you cannot
say aces.

[2:54:30]
say aces.
Okay, if I if it is not a strong hand, I
I like five sweeted. Uh but
uh but it's a it's a fun hand for things
to
happen.
But so the lo the logical answer is

[2:54:45]
But so the lo the logical answer is
obviously whatever makes the most money
is the best stream of income. But the
emotional answer is not that one. Uh I
would say actually it's uh very
rewarding this 3 4K that comes from
YouTube. Even if it is the smallest
stream of income that that I have those

[2:55:01]
stream of income that that I have those
3 4K are like okay here's my my tours or
my whatever. So it's like
uh so that one is rewarding because it
comes with a lot of effort and it's not
a lot. is very a very small thing

[2:55:15]
a lot. is very a very small thing
compared to to the expenses and it can
still be a lot compared to what it used
to be because you've seen the number
grow over time right so obviously the
absolute amount might not make a big
difference in your current income I can
understand that with all the effort you

[2:55:31]
understand that with all the effort you
put in and you've seen it grow you know
it it feels like a lot
no but for a English speaking poker
content creator it would be 20k per
month no yeah but still for you it can
be you know in In the past it was only

[2:55:45]
be you know in In the past it was only
500 right you've seen the number grow
and like you said YouTube is probably
what you're most passionate about so
yeah the thing is that now I cannot
separate that from the expenses I know
that I do spend for that

[2:56:00]
that I do spend for that
600 to 700k cost you mentioned earlier
of uh of of employees it's not going to
cover it yes
exactly yes the the biggest stream of
income I have is the subscriptions uh in
the poker school uh the monthly

[2:56:16]
the poker school uh the monthly
subscriptions. The second one is the the
income from uh affiliate u uh
stuff. The other income but I I cannot

[2:56:31]
stuff. The other income but I I cannot
really for NDI reasons to speak about
income from sponsors uh but that one was
very big too and other incomes. Um
obviously like you know starting a whole

[2:56:45]
obviously like you know starting a whole
school with subscriptions paid model
work affiliate already seems like easier
easier for me the the money from pocket
actually feels the best last year I I
had my best year I won over a
million so I'm very happy about that and

[2:57:03]
million so I'm very happy about that and
that felt super good too so p money from
poker is
actually even the most rewarding. You
know what happens with money from poker
that I also I cannot separate it from uh

[2:57:16]
that I also I cannot separate it from uh
the even if I'm speaking about the net
income I cannot separated from the
downstreams and the upstreams and the
the whole month of um changing results.
So, so in a way, uh I I I I see that as

[2:57:33]
So, so in a way, uh I I I I see that as
unstable
uh compared to other streams of income
that are pretty much the same every
month. Uh so in entrepreneurship uh
income income is way more certain than

[2:57:46]
income income is way more certain than
as a poker player.
So
um
yeah that's the that's the answer. Which
income stream would you recommend people

[2:58:00]
income stream would you recommend people
not to try giving me your experience?
One that you hate whatever you have to
do to make it
right. Yeah. So like like you said your
subscriptions in your poker score are
the biggest but if you hate teaching

[2:58:16]
the biggest but if you hate teaching
then you should probably not do it.
Yes, you should. I mean, or you should
do it. I mean, would you advise uh
anybody on the audience to leave their
job to play poker if they don't even

[2:58:30]
job to play poker if they don't even
know if they're going to achieve the
goal of becoming professional poker
players? Probably you wouldn't uh you
would tell to you would say to them,
okay, you you do this job that you don't
like. You better make sure you can pay
for your own life for at least six to

[2:58:46]
for your own life for at least six to
one year, six months, one year or even
more. If you if you have a family, you
better make sure you you are a good dad
or or or whatever. So, you better make
sure everything is all right with your
life. And then those four hours that you

[2:59:03]
life. And then those four hours that you
waste every day or those two hours, two
hours that can become more efficient,
you really hate what you are doing. Use
that as motivation to put all of those
hours into something new and develop a

[2:59:17]
hours into something new and develop a
skill, develop whatever you need to
develop to actually create for yourself
a new life. So I think the the
the kind of guru you should follow your

[2:59:32]
the kind of guru you should follow your
dreams, you should do whatever makes you
happy. Uh I I think it's important to uh
combine it with uh certain aspects of uh
you better make sure your life is in a

[2:59:45]
you better make sure your life is in a
good place uh before you do something
that is risky, right? Because when I
think about my early poker career, I
was, you know, I was in my third career
uh that I left the first year, the first

[3:00:00]
uh that I left the first year, the first
year or two, I started playing poker
more seriously between
10 p.m. and 5:00 a.m. every day when my
mom was asleeping. Uh I I I was actually

[3:00:15]
mom was asleeping. Uh I I I was actually
studying uh university at home because
my my mother told me I will not spend
more money for you to go to a to to to
the colle to to a city where you can
study this career. Uh you you left two

[3:00:31]
study this career. Uh you you left two
careers and I'm not going to spend more
money uh on this. Uh you you have to
study but you will do it at home. So I
would uh literally play poker at night
for six, seven hours every day when she

[3:00:46]
for six, seven hours every day when she
was sleeping because she would not
approve me doing that. Uh but I was at
the same time doing the other thing,
right? Uh, and then after a few months,
five, six months, I got maybe a 2K, 3K

[3:01:01]
five, six months, I got maybe a 2K, 3K
bankroll, I moved to a house with four
other other friends for a small room
that cost me like €200 per month. Uh,
so you can build from wherever you're

[3:01:17]
so you can build from wherever you're
at, uh, a new life, right? But at the
same time, you need I mean it's easier
for someone who is a studying uh right
you you have a a roof, you have a house
where you can live uh your family gave

[3:01:31]
where you can live uh your family gave
you that. But if you are older and you
you you pay for your own life and you
have a job or whatever, you better make
sure you're safe and people who rely on
you are safe, right?
Uh but at the same time, yes, I I I

[3:01:46]
Uh but at the same time, yes, I I I
think you should uh you should make sure
you use your time wisely so you can
create the life you want because it's
worth it. It's 100% worth it.
Wise words. Adam, any uh any any any

[3:02:03]
Wise words. Adam, any uh any any any
questions you have for for Alias around
this topic?
Not quite this topic, but I want to
segue a little bit into reflecting on
your career or careers plural we should

[3:02:15]
your career or careers plural we should
call it. And yeah, first of one was what
has been an important lesson that you've
learned through your poker journey that
has set you up for life.
I would say logical thinking trying to

[3:02:30]
I would say logical thinking trying to
understand the reasons why things happen
around you, why people say they say the
things they say. Uh what are the
intentions behind what they say?
Uh I I I

[3:02:45]
Uh I I I
I for some reason in a very unproductive
way, I always try to make the best
decision for the most stupid things. H I
will do like comp I will do this is
crazy but I will do competitions of

[3:03:00]
crazy but I will do competitions of
buying eggs from different supermarkets
to find the most delicious eggs
competitions of the best avocado brand
in this particular place and then I will
find the best of the best and and I
learn uh you know how to how to I

[3:03:17]
learn uh you know how to how to I
approach every decision on uh
okay what are the options available what
works the best for me, what I'm seeking
out of uh whatever. When when I bought
my house in in Tokyo, I made a list of

[3:03:31]
my house in in Tokyo, I made a list of
things my house needed to check all
those things. So, not near a huge road
with noise. Uh not this uh two bedrooms
for sure. I need a onebedroom for my
studio. I don't want to work in the same
place I sleep or in the same place I

[3:03:47]
place I sleep or in the same place I
same place I eat. Um things like that,
right? So based on the situation I was
in at the time uh
logical thinking
um make the make the right decision. uh

[3:04:02]
um make the make the right decision. uh
but now I am trying also to distance
myself from uh caring a lot because it's
too much it can become a bit
obsessive but being a logical thinker I
I I I I I find myself very s surprised

[3:04:18]
I I I I I find myself very s surprised
when I read certain things on on X uh or
social media from people who clearly
don't know what they are saying uh or
emotionally driven uh conversation

[3:04:30]
emotionally driven uh conversation
ations. Uh, first of all, you're not
understanding where he's coming from.
The other guy is not understanding what
the other guy is thinking. You both are
way too dumb to have a conversation and
understand each other. Why do you even
talk? That kind of thing. You know what

[3:04:45]
talk? That kind of thing. You know what
I mean? Uh, uh, logical thinking.
Really? I think it's is what I got from
poker.
How do you deal with people who don't
think as logically? So, as you're
running a team, managing people, I'm

[3:05:01]
running a team, managing people, I'm
sure you run into people who don't have
that same logic framework. How do you
Yeah. communicate, but also have
interactions with people who maybe don't
have a logical background? To fire them
very fast.

[3:05:19]
Wow.
And
um at the end what I mean what matters
when you hire someone is that that some

[3:05:30]
when you hire someone is that that some
whoever
um he or she is can do the job you you
are hiring that person for right so as
long as the job is being do done in a
good way it doesn't really matter as
much if they are logical thinkers or uh

[3:05:46]
much if they are logical thinkers or uh
emotionally dri driven people
particularly in content creation because
you know art is heavily related with
emotionally emotional
personalities and myself I I find I know

[3:06:01]
personalities and myself I I find I know
I am emotional too but at the same time
I can combine that with logical
thinking.
Um, so, um, I find very annoying when
someone waste my time, for example, to

[3:06:18]
someone waste my time, for example, to
tell me emotionally driven reasons why
they should get a higher salary. [ __ ]
you. It's not my [ __ ] problem.
Whatever is going on in your life, so

[3:06:31]
Whatever is going on in your life, so
you want more money from me. And I am a
very generous boss. I I would say I pay
very well. Uh but uh I hate that
approach, you know. Okay, tell me what
are you doing to deserve more money?
Approach it that way. So these were the

[3:06:46]
Approach it that way. So these were the
expectations. Have you met them? Are you
here? And I was expecting you to be
here. Okay, then we talk. You know,
that's logical thinking in a way. Uh but
I hate when people try to ma use
emotional manipulation to get out

[3:07:01]
emotional manipulation to get out
something from you. So those kind of
people I I find uh that are the people
who are are more likely
to to so so I don't like them let's say
I don't know uh people who waste my time

[3:07:16]
I don't know uh people who waste my time
for emotionally
uh for but don't get me wrong I don't
have any issue listening to someone who
has a
problem if they are not asking for

[3:07:30]
problem if they are not asking for
something in return I hate the manipul
ation aspect of it. Uh let's say uh so
that's where emotional thinking becomes
a problem when the person is not
rational enough to understand the
situation. uh and and

[3:07:47]
situation. uh and and
and they try
to yeah I I don't know
uh this
emotional
reasoning is uh totally against logical

[3:08:01]
reasoning is uh totally against logical
thinking in many ways not only in in job
related stuff speaking with your boss uh
in many other things in just what I was
saying before people talking to each
other and understanding each other You
need to be able to separate yourself

[3:08:17]
need to be able to separate yourself
from whatever you're speaking and your
emotions and try to understand who are
your who are you speaking with. Uh what
do they want? Uh what do they believe?
Um that comes from poker too. You need

[3:08:30]
Um that comes from poker too. You need
to think what is this guy doing here?
What is he playing with? What are the
groups of hands he
has? If I do this, what he will do with
70% of his range? He will fall. Maybe I
need to bet. Uh is that's logical

[3:08:47]
need to bet. Uh is that's logical
thinking that comes from from
poker.
In most conversations in life, you see a
lot of people uh speaking with each
other for at least in their private life

[3:09:00]
other for at least in their private life
mostly emotional reasons.
And I would say it's not a huge problem
for me in my company um in what relates
to uh business relationships because at
the end of the day we are speaking about

[3:09:15]
the end of the day we are speaking about
things that are related with the job
they are doing. So that's totally
appropriate appropriate uh but for
uh people in general I think approaching
life in a more logical way is helpful. I
think it's good. It's a good thing.

[3:09:31]
think it's good. It's a good thing.
Yeah. Yeah, and as you mentioned there,
poker kind of instills in you that
logical way of approaching problem
solving on many situations. And when
people lack that, they can be
frustrating to deal with because you
almost haven't got a baseline to uh to
speak on. Yeah, I really like the kind

[3:09:46]
speak on. Yeah, I really like the kind
of the way you went through that kind of
question in terms of valuing other
people who who have emotional sides and
how that helps with creativity, but also
like there's elements of being logical
where to have conversations on certain
topics, there needs to be a logical
framework to kind of get to an outcome,

[3:10:00]
framework to kind of get to an outcome,
which I think poker instills in you very
well. So, I'm quite obsessed at the
moment with the concept of reinventing
yourself and being able to mold and
change your identity over time. You've
made quite a lot of these changes, so
I'm curious to know how you reflect on
those. So you've gone from a grinder to

[3:10:15]
those. So you've gone from a grinder to
a content creator to an entrepreneur.
How hard have you found it to make those
big pivots and identity changes and what
goes with that? By this I mean when we
change our path and our role, we also
change like the stories we tell about
ourel. I think Rene touched on this

[3:10:30]
ourel. I think Rene touched on this
earlier as well like giving up that kind
of cash game personality identity. It
seems easy but it's actually quite
challenging to do that. You've done
three big pivots that I can picture. How
has it felt to to make those changes for
yourself?

[3:10:45]
yourself?
So the first one that was difficult is
the the one uh Rene mentioned which is I
am a cash game high stakes poker player
and changing that to I am not anymore a

[3:11:00]
and changing that to I am not anymore a
high stakes cash uh game poker player
that was painful uh because you attach a
big part of yourself to you know a big
part of your worth uh to that thin. Uh

[3:11:16]
part of your worth uh to that thin. Uh
so you experience that with
uh discom discomfort I would
say but as time goes
uh the that discomfort becomes

[3:11:32]
uh the that discomfort becomes
smaller. The problem comes when you make
a change and that change uh leads to
frustration. So for example, imagine
that I put just I will share my my how I

[3:11:45]
that I put just I will share my my how I
felt uh certain things. I take the
action of um changing my my life in many
ways and I expected to do that in six
months and then I am in a place where I
want to be and then build from there.

[3:12:01]
want to be and then build from there.
But actually that doesn't happen in six
months. It happens or it happens or it
doesn't even happen in two years.
and you are just there two years after I
made this huge decision that I thought

[3:12:15]
made this huge decision that I thought
led to a six months change but I'm two
years in I am solving problems I didn't
know that they existed before they just
appear suddenly I'm just here uh
changing this [ __ ] Ivan from this guy

[3:12:31]
changing this [ __ ] Ivan from this guy
who wants to change his bank
account and a lot of things comes they
come from inexperience uh from not
knowing enough about the things you are
the things you are doing because I if I

[3:12:45]
the things you are doing because I if I
knew before what I know now day one I am
delegating as far as fast as I can you
know delegating as fast as I can and the
first trip I do to Hong Kong to create
my company that I visit there I bring

[3:13:00]
my company that I visit there I bring
someone and I give them access to the
bank account and I make them sign a
contract and I don't do it myself I hire
someone else to do
So you know so everything is attached
and properly working well and there is a
system in place for them to pay and for

[3:13:15]
system in place for them to pay and for
them to not be able to pay somebody who
they shouldn't pay or have access to
money they shouldn't have. So uh I I
would approach life completely
different. uh I would be way more
focused on understanding my resources,

[3:13:31]
focused on understanding my resources,
the money I have and how should I spend
it so I can put my time properly in the
things I actually need the things that I
can only do myself which is most of the
times the maker time creating the
product or creating uh the time for

[3:13:46]
product or creating uh the time for
being a poker player or creating the
time for studying or making a course or
making a video whatever it is. Uh
so yeah uh
I'm did I respond everything or there

[3:14:00]
I'm did I respond everything or there
was something else? Yeah. Yeah. From
that I got change is often a bit messy.
It's not like a linear thing and it can
be frustrating especially when you have
expectations of how those changes should
go and then you get caught up in the
kind of the messy middle of trying to

[3:14:15]
kind of the messy middle of trying to
solve new problems and the frustration
of that. And the lesson you've learned
through that process for yourself is
delegating quicker, knowing your
resources, getting those kind of jobs
off your plate. That's creates
frustration, annoyance, so you can go
back to the real reason you made this
change, back to that kind of make a time

[3:14:31]
change, back to that kind of make a time
in in being creative. So yeah, I can
relate to that as well. And I feel like
when we do change, often we have the
expectation of something amazing. It's
like, oh, I'm going to make this big
change, but we also have like the fear
of what if it's not? And then when we
start doing it, we realize, [ __ ] we're
kind of out of our depth here. because

[3:14:46]
kind of out of our depth here. because
every time you start something new, you
haven't got the skills yet to uh to
execute. Well, I think a lot of people
get kind of trapped in that kind of half
in half out without kind of taking that
kind of big leap. So, I think from your
stories, you've obviously been someone
who's experienced the same kind of

[3:15:00]
who's experienced the same kind of
feelings, but you've just jumped into
stuff and you've solved the problems on
the fly. Then over time, you found
systems and delegations that that makes
it quicker and more more efficient. So,
yeah, very good very good lessons there.
All right, another question is what does
success look like for you today? What
would you how would you define success
for you?

[3:15:17]
Success looks
like living my life in a way that I
don't do things I don't want to
do but at the same time I have the most
time to do uh the actual things I want

[3:15:33]
time to do uh the actual things I want
to do and those things are related with
building things. Uh so I find a lot of
satisfaction out of the creation process
of something. uh it can be a

[3:15:47]
of something. uh it can be a
strategy studying something, it can be a
video. Uh but the creation part of
things I I I find a lot of satisfaction
out of that. I can spend countless hours
uh

[3:16:01]
creating but I do hate the manage the
management aspect of
uh what comes with u being a creator,
right? or having a business. Uh so so

[3:16:15]
right? or having a business. Uh so so
for me I I I think uh I I will find
myself in the best situation
when everything around me is prepared
for me to create uh and to not be
disturbed uh by those tasks that could

[3:16:34]
disturbed uh by those tasks that could
actually could actually be done by by
somebody else. I mean at at least I made
that the goal of my life in the past six
seven years. So I'm choosing to do this

[3:16:47]
seven years. So I'm choosing to do this
career path um having these issues
um with the lack of knowledge I had.
Okay, what do I
do? I I did what I could and what I knew

[3:17:00]
do? I I did what I could and what I knew
uh and I learned along the way. So I I
hope I can find myself in a much better
spot every month that passed because now
I am thinking about life uh and issues.
So we have a in Spain a game which is

[3:17:16]
So we have a in Spain a game which is
called hot potato. If you if you have
the you play with friends if you have
the hot potato you need to pass it to
somebody else and then the one who has
it at the end of the game lose, right?
So I think about problems that I don't
want to have as a hot potato. So I'm

[3:17:31]
want to have as a hot potato. So I'm
thinking, okay, I have a hot potato
right here. Who do I pass it pass it to?
Do I need to hire someone for this hot
potato to be managed? H so I'm h having
this kind of thinking process right now
of uh of uh learning issues and trying

[3:17:49]
of uh of uh learning issues and trying
to solve those issues. Uh issues are a
hot potato. If you really don't want
your life to be about that issue, you
better find a way for that issue to be
solved and not by you. What would you

[3:18:01]
solved and not by you. What would you
say is the highlights of your poker
career or the proudest moments?
So in what relates to poker I can think
of uh a cap a couple let's say I think

[3:18:16]
of uh a cap a couple let's say I think
that uh being able so there was
certainly a learning path from uh being
um let's say a poker player who was uh
making two or three big blinds uh doing

[3:18:31]
making two or three big blinds uh doing
the super supernovit uh to actually
playing games that are tough like with
very strong players and at higher levels
even if I didn't uh continue that path
in life and I change uh I find the the

[3:18:49]
in life and I change uh I find the the
development I had to uh to live uh as
very meaningful for me uh I learned a
lot and also I in my poker career I find

[3:19:01]
lot and also I in my poker career I find
meaning uh after uh winning my few uh
first um big scores and wings win
events. So I won a couple of scoops, one
W coupe. Uh last year I won two 25k high

[3:19:17]
W coupe. Uh last year I won two 25k high
rollers. Uh so um and then and a few
other results of course it's h that um
moment of realization that okay, I'm

[3:19:30]
moment of realization that okay, I'm
here. I'm playing against these strong
guys. I'm part of them. And you know
that feeling is rewarding uh very
rewarding for me because it's my goal
today. My goal today is being able to
compete uh and create content at the
same time playing at at a very high

[3:19:46]
same time playing at at a very high
level which is I think the most
difficult goal for any content creator
who plays poker and creates content
about poker and that's the the most
difficult thing to achieve. I think
being able to be good at two things at

[3:20:01]
being able to be good at two things at
the same time. In what relates to uh
content creation, I also find a lot of
um let's
say meaning and I feel proud of what we

[3:20:18]
say meaning and I feel proud of what we
have been able to achieve in the past
two years because we learned enough
about content creation, about poker
formats. So we could actually move the

[3:20:30]
formats. So we could actually move the
channel to a more main mainstream
category of content of poker
content. So it was
difficult. One thing you need to
consider it is that in in the Spanish
speaking market, poker is not a game we

[3:20:48]
speaking market, poker is not a game we
grow up with. You know, poker is not a
is not a thing in the Spanish culture.
It's an American thing. Some Americans
do play poker with their families or
they do know the game maybe since they

[3:21:00]
they do know the game maybe since they
are kids. Uh but in the Spanish speaking
market that doesn't happen and also uh
poker was never mainstream in the
Spanish speaking market. So I think it's
a lot easier to create a big uh poker
channel if your uh potential audience is

[3:21:16]
channel if your uh potential audience is
10 time 10 times or 20 times higher. Uh
it's just a much bigger niche. Uh so uh
being able to create content that is
watched by an average of 250 300k people

[3:21:31]
watched by an average of 250 300k people
in at least in the last few years even
more I think I I have reasons to feel
proud about that because that was
actually a difficult achievement and
it's there is a lot of work uh so me and
my team uh could do that. Uh so so those

[3:21:49]
my team uh could do that. Uh so so those
were all of those things I I feel proud
of. uh being able to to compete and
being able to create content at this
level. Both things and everything I do

[3:22:01]
level. Both things and everything I do
relates to being able to spend more time
of on those two things because the more
time I have the better I can do those
two
things at least now that's that's where
I am at. Amazing. Well, congratulations
to you. As we've spoke about on this

[3:22:16]
to you. As we've spoke about on this
conversation, it is not easy to
multitask multiple things. To be a
content creator at a high level and a
poker play at a high level whilst
running a successful business is very
hard to juggle. So amazing for you to
have found ways to uh in your way excel

[3:22:30]
have found ways to uh in your way excel
in both of those simultaneously. And
yeah, for you right now, what does the
future hold? Where do you see yourself
in the next year or so? You mentioned a
lot of stuff about delegation and
systemizing your businesses. How do you
see your role in PC over the next year
or so?

[3:22:45]
or so?
So this is a year I want to spend uh for
two two main things. Uh one would be uh
making my business strong and
independent from me. Uh but that means I
also need to spend a lot of time

[3:23:00]
also need to spend a lot of time
creating content uh for for the poker
school uh but also uh create create a
lot of systems and and make sure I
structure my company the the right way.
Uh the second part of the year I want to
spend it mostly on uh studying the the

[3:23:17]
spend it mostly on uh studying the the
game of tournaments more deeply. Uh so I
can in
2026 start playing more diverse
tournaments. Uh, one of the decisions I
made uh, last year, it was that after my

[3:23:34]
made uh, last year, it was that after my
uh, contract ended with Poker
Stars, if I come back to play live poker
tournaments, and I think I should
because I I think it it it is the best
content I can make and it is

[3:23:46]
content I can make and it is
a it allows me to play at at a very high
level while I create content at the same
time. But this year I want to play more
mostly online to to practice and prepare
for that.
Um I need to be able to fund that myself

[3:24:03]
Um I need to be able to fund that myself
with my own companies. I I don't want to
rely on others. I don't want to have a
company who does not allow me to go to
certain events from competitors.
So I think for to reach the next level

[3:24:18]
So I think for to reach the next level
in content I need to go to the best
event available at at all times. It
doesn't matter who is the organizer and
I need to develop a few relationships

[3:24:30]
I need to develop a few relationships
that I hope I can develop. For example,
I do not yet have uh the relationships I
need to record content in places like
Triton or WSOP, but I think the
incentives are there for them too to get

[3:24:46]
incentives are there for them too to get
uh exposure in a big channel. So maybe I
can make that happen. But I I I would
like to to attend uh and make content
out of those events too with the same
level of freedom we have creating

[3:25:00]
level of freedom we have creating
content with Poker Stars.
uh if poker stars did see the value and
and it was very worth it for them, I
think other companies will see it too. H
so I want to to be able to fund all of
that myself without help. So I can do
whatever I want. So I can do a

[3:25:15]
whatever I want. So I can do a
snowboarding trip for a month and I can
also share that and pay for it and it
does not
matter. Exciting times ahead. So this
has been a very far-ranging
conversation. We've really enjoyed it
and you've shared a lot of valuable
insights. What would you like the main

[3:25:31]
insights. What would you like the main
takeaway to be for the audience today?
So I accepted this podcast um mostly to
get the perspective of Renee as a
competitor on many things we talk about

[3:25:45]
competitor on many things we talk about
today
uh in relationship to manage uh a career
uh life decisions
um and many other things. I I don't do
podcast often. So I actually accepting

[3:26:02]
podcast often. So I actually accepting
was something like I I would not do it.
Uh I probably will not do it this year
again or next
year. I usually don't uh go into other
channels. I do my own thing. Uh and I

[3:26:15]
channels. I do my own thing. Uh and I
did enjoy it. Uh because both of you uh
I I I respect both of both of you.
you're clearly uh people who who know
their stuff
and I enjoy having a conversation with

[3:26:31]
and I enjoy having a conversation with
two smart people uh about deep topics.
Uh so that's the one of the things I
could get from both of you that I
probably could not get uh from many
others uh interviewers or podcasters I
would say. uh main takeaway. Uh I

[3:26:49]
would say. uh main takeaway. Uh I
enjoyed I I also knew I could share with
you
uh
things that nobody else would ask or
care about. Uh so this this whole period

[3:27:03]
care about. Uh so this this whole period
of changing the game I was playing
uh creating content this whole period
between 2017 and to today uh it is a
period of my life that I could share

[3:27:16]
period of my life that I could share
with you more easily compared to
uh other formats of content. I would not
do it for my own channel. I I don't
think it would perform well because
people don't care a lot about what you

[3:27:31]
people don't care a lot about what you
feel or what
you or why you do things in a deep way.
They they just want the fun, right? Uh
and a lot of these things we discussed
today are not the fun. But some people
who really care about their careers, who

[3:27:46]
who really care about their careers, who
really care about their life decisions
will find this useful. Uh
so so yeah, I that's my main takeaway. I
think we created value so that was worth
it. I do too. And yeah, we really
appreciate you spending the last three

[3:28:01]
appreciate you spending the last three
and a half hours with us. We know you
don't do this often but the audience the
audience who like to go deep will have a
very good time uh listening to this
conversation. So yeah, we appreciate
your time. Thank you very much. Great
conversation. Thank you Alas for sharing

[3:28:15]
conversation. Thank you Alas for sharing
your very diverse journey as first
starting in poker then transitioning
into all these other things to now
transition into poker again. He's done a
lot. Adam, main takeaways.
Yeah, it was a great conversation. A lot
of different topics to what we normally

[3:28:31]
of different topics to what we normally
cover. Uh recurring theme for me was
around freedom and about how much time
and energy he's spent on creating the
life he wants. If you look at the life
he lives now, it's looks amazing. He's
got these home bases around the world,
but he's also been thinking about how to

[3:28:45]
but he's also been thinking about how to
create freedom for a long time in terms
of traveling around trying to find
different places. And it's been points
of that where it's got quite
complicated. He's almost like over
complicated things, but he's got a point
now where he's able to live the life he
wants through uh delegating stuff,

[3:29:00]
wants through uh delegating stuff,
through systemizing stuff, and through
basically just that overarching theme of
what do I want my life to be like? What
things do I enjoy doing? So, right now,
he enjoys content. He enjoys playing.
And it's quite interesting to see
someone who's quite obsessive about this
is what I want to spend my time doing.

[3:29:15]
is what I want to spend my time doing.
Nothing else will get in the way. And I
think this whole year for him is going
to be about creating systems and systems
to uh delegate stuff and to uh basically
remove himself from the things he
doesn't like with the current business
model of content creation and run a
business so he can get back to the
freedom of doing what he enjoys which

[3:29:31]
freedom of doing what he enjoys which
right now is playing poker and creating
content on YouTube which then yeah goes
into the kind of systems approaches. I
asked him to uh relate creating systems
to poker players and his main ones were
basically having time protected
understand your performance habits and

[3:29:45]
understand your performance habits and
health. You mentioned sleep, you
mentioned food, you mentioned exercise,
using your time efficiently and then
yeah, systemize that into a way you can
be productive. But yeah, overarching
theme of that was basically commit to
poker fully, have that drive to want to
succeed and create systems that allow
you to perform, be there at the tables

[3:30:01]
you to perform, be there at the tables
and do that consistently. Next one I
really found interesting was the
seasons. I really found interesting
about almost like a time planning, time
management system of thinking about what
you want to achieve over a year. And he
talked about synergy between seasons. So

[3:30:15]
talked about synergy between seasons. So
one season would be a certain thing you
do and that would lead into the next
season. And that got me thinking about
how athletes think about their years.
They periodize their training towards
certain tasks. And it got me thinking,
what are my seasons? What would my three
or four seasons of the year be? If I was
intensely doing one thing for a period

[3:30:31]
intensely doing one thing for a period
of time, what would those two to three
things be? For pocket players, it's
often a bit simpler, but you can still
have seasons of studying, seasons of
intense grinding, seasons of other
things. So I thought that was very
interesting. And then yeah, overarching
theme of passion as well. passion for
what you do. Right now, his passion is

[3:30:46]
what you do. Right now, his passion is
very much towards creating content, but
also he's got the passion to go back
into learning poker at a high level. And
I think that was a yeah, kind of a
recurring thing. I was thinking about
how he's driven to uh still want to
learn, to still want to improve, to
still want to put content out there. Um,

[3:31:00]
still want to put content out there. Um,
and yeah, he hasn't really got like an
end goal of this is where I want to get
to. He enjoys the pursuit. He enjoys
what he's doing. And yeah, I thought it
was very refreshing to uh listen to
somebody who's been in poker for 15 plus
years to still have that kind of not
beginners enthusiasm but that passion

[3:31:16]
beginners enthusiasm but that passion
for what he does, what he puts out there
and to yeah kind of be driven to uh
perform at a high level both as a
content creator and also as a poker
player and as we touched on that's a a
hard balance to juggle. How about
yourself Rene? What the main takeaways
for you? Yeah, the end goal was kind of

[3:31:30]
for you? Yeah, the end goal was kind of
to create time again, right? I thought
that was that was that was really ironic
and I also wanted to highlight that that
yes he wants to structure his life so he
can do whatever he wants to do but he's
also not dirty to put in the work right

[3:31:45]
also not dirty to put in the work right
he he puts in the hours like when I was
doing some research on him I saw that he
he went to Georgia for six months and he
literally worked 247 okay for six months
straight to get some sort of project
done so that you know he's trying to put
set everything in a way up that he can

[3:32:01]
set everything in a way up that he can
live the life that he wants Right. We
all want want a life, but I definitely
think he's a good representative of
Yeah, you have to put in a lot of work
to get a life like that, right? For
example, he mentioned the school uh as
kind of a funding of his product that he

[3:32:17]
kind of a funding of his product that he
really wants to do, right? Which was
playing poker and create content around
it. But for that, you know, yeah, it
costs a lot of money, right? So then he
had to build to build his business for
that. So yeah, I think there was just a
lot to learn from from him. Uh in terms

[3:32:31]
lot to learn from from him. Uh in terms
of poker strategy uh obviously we
touched on a lot of other things as well
because I definitely think ads has so
much more to offer whereas for example
we could talk a bit more about poker
strategy specifically with other guests.
So we wanted to make sure that we cover
a lot of other areas as well. We did

[3:32:46]
a lot of other areas as well. We did
talk he did shine a light on terms of uh
studying for example instead of trying
to memorize how 10 BB 20 BB 40 BB 100 BB
plays he really went okay what do I
know? Well I'm a Kashkin player I know
post play. So what changes? Well, we're

[3:33:01]
post play. So what changes? Well, we're
going to play a lower SPR. So he
studied, okay, what what kind of impact
does SPR have on my strategy? And then
you take those concepts and you start
applying them. So it's a way more
efficient way of of studying.
Um he touched on staying out of trouble,

[3:33:18]
Um he touched on staying out of trouble,
right? That was one of the points in the
little miniourse that he gave and he was
mainly talking about the ICM and the
bubble phase. Watch out that you don't
get into trouble. He talked about the
trade-offs, wins versus lose. You don't,

[3:33:30]
trade-offs, wins versus lose. You don't,
on one side, you want to survive, right?
But on the other side, if it's worth it,
you want to also set yourself up to win
the tournament because that's where the
big money is.
Um, he also talked about like selection
in terms of field size, whereas bigger
field size, they they can make you more

[3:33:45]
field size, they they can make you more
money, but al also increase the
variance. to also add some lower field
sizes in there so you can experience
wins and also get more experience
playing final table so that when you do
get into a big final table at a bigger
field you have more experience um and in
the end also we touched on the brand

[3:34:02]
the end also we touched on the brand
right I asked him well what's the value
of the brand should people start a brand
he said well that depends for the
reasons you do it right uh if you if you
if you come across with the right
passion he really talked a lot about
authent a authenticity as well right

[3:34:15]
authent a authenticity as well right
that you have to do it from the right
frame and he kind of sees If you do it
for the wrong reason, people will see
through you and it will not succeed. So,
