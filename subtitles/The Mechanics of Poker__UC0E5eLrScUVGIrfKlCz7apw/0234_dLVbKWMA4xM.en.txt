the the perfection thing uh I think it
became more uh so it it grew on me even

[16:37]
became more uh so it it grew on me even

[16:37]
became more uh so it it grew on me even
more uh when I started uh caring about

[16:41]
more uh when I started uh caring about

[16:41]
more uh when I started uh caring about
being successful on YouTube because I

[16:44]
being successful on YouTube because I

[16:44]
being successful on YouTube because I
realized that on YouTube

[16:47]
realized that on YouTube

[16:47]
realized that on YouTube
uh it pays very well to be better than

[16:52]
uh it pays very well to be better than

[16:52]
uh it pays very well to be better than
most. So YouTube, the way it works, the

[16:56]
most. So YouTube, the way it works, the

[16:56]
most. So YouTube, the way it works, the
algorithm it is that the best video wins

[17:01]
algorithm it is that the best video wins

[17:01]
algorithm it is that the best video wins
and YouTube is is just interested in

[17:04]
and YouTube is is just interested in

[17:04]
and YouTube is is just interested in
in getting people in uh to to watch uh

[17:08]
in getting people in uh to to watch uh

[17:08]
in getting people in uh to to watch uh
videos for longer, right? So the best

[17:10]
videos for longer, right? So the best

[17:10]
videos for longer, right? So the best
video is the video that people will will

[17:12]
video is the video that people will will

[17:12]
video is the video that people will will
watch the longest and the people the the

[17:16]
watch the longest and the people the the

[17:16]
watch the longest and the people the the
video that people will click on. Uh so

[17:20]
video that people will click on. Uh so

[17:20]
video that people will click on. Uh so
basically if you have a let's say a 55

[17:24]
basically if you have a let's say a 55

[17:24]
basically if you have a let's say a 55
60%

[17:26]
60%

[17:26]
60%
uh audience retention uh you're winning

[17:29]
uh audience retention uh you're winning

[17:29]
uh audience retention uh you're winning
against any other video that it is below

[17:31]
against any other video that it is below

[17:31]
against any other video that it is below
55% audience retention. So so imagine

[17:36]
55% audience retention. So so imagine

[17:36]
55% audience retention. So so imagine
you have I don't know 10 million videos

[17:39]
you have I don't know 10 million videos

[17:39]
you have I don't know 10 million videos
with uh under 60% audience retention.

[17:45]
with uh under 60% audience retention.

[17:45]
with uh under 60% audience retention.
You are you are at 61%. But you are on

[17:48]
You are you are at 61%. But you are on

[17:48]
You are you are at 61%. But you are on
top of 10 million videos. Do you know

[17:50]
top of 10 million videos. Do you know

[17:50]
top of 10 million videos. Do you know
what I mean? Yeah. Which means that

[17:52]
what I mean? Yeah. Which means that

[17:52]
what I mean? Yeah. Which means that
YouTube is going to recommend that video

[17:54]
YouTube is going to recommend that video

[17:54]
YouTube is going to recommend that video
instead of all the other ones.

[17:57]
instead of all the other ones.

[17:57]
instead of all the other ones.
Correct. So you get exponentially higher

[18:00]
Correct. So you get exponentially higher

[18:00]
Correct. So you get exponentially higher
returns, the more the better your video

[18:04]
returns, the more the better your video

than the rest, you know, you get you get

[18:10]
than the rest, you know, you get you get

[18:10]
than the rest, you know, you get you get
higher returns.

[18:12]
higher returns.

[18:12]
higher returns.
you get higher returns but you don't get

[18:16]
you get higher returns but you don't get

[18:16]
you get higher returns but you don't get
exponential higher returns. True. And

[18:18]
exponential higher returns. True. And

[18:18]
exponential higher returns. True. And
you and I guess also you can decide who

and I would try to understand everything
about it to make a good decision. I

[19:36]
about it to make a good decision. I

about it to make a good decision. I
would start thinking the same way about

would start thinking the same way about
uh YouTube content. Okay, if I speak for

[19:42]
uh YouTube content. Okay, if I speak for

two minutes about how I feel about this
random thing, uh maybe it becomes

[19:48]

um so for example uh for

and those things to not be related with
each other. Right? So when I uh started

[20:35]
each other. Right? So when I uh started

studying, going to more creative sides,

[1:03:04]
studying, going to more creative sides,

[1:03:04]
studying, going to more creative sides,
thinking about the game, you're not

[1:03:05]

thinking about the game, you're not
putting as much reps into the

[1:03:06]
putting as much reps into the

[1:03:06]
putting as much reps into the
performance side. So, I think the kind

[1:03:08]

of simple kind of answer I would give to

[1:03:10]
of simple kind of answer I would give to

[1:03:10]
of simple kind of answer I would give to
that would be uh it's very hard to be

you're not putting the hours in. I say

[1:03:16]
you're not putting the hours in. I say

[1:03:16]
you're not putting the hours in. I say
the hours that's the criteria that's

[1:03:18]
the hours that's the criteria that's

[1:03:18]
the hours that's the criteria that's
relevant to you, but if you're not

[1:03:20]
relevant to you, but if you're not

[1:03:20]
relevant to you, but if you're not
putting in the hours that you need to be

[1:03:21]
putting in the hours that you need to be

[1:03:21]
putting in the hours that you need to be
on top of your game. So, yeah, I think

[1:03:23]
on top of your game. So, yeah, I think

[1:03:23]
on top of your game. So, yeah, I think
it's a it's a challenge. It's when

[1:03:24]
it's a it's a challenge. It's when

[1:03:29]
Ellis's case about 10 things at once. It
gets it's a trade-off that you have to

maybe tournaments play a bit uh better
even than cash with my strengths in a

uh more math based and and

uh more math based and and
I I like play situations sometimes in a

I I like play situations sometimes in a
more intuitive context uh way. So

[2:12:52]
more intuitive context uh way. So

more intuitive context uh way. So
tournaments is more about context. Erh

think is the pronunciation uh compared

[2:13:05]
think is the pronunciation uh compared

uh math. Uh so I'm more I'm

uh math. Uh so I'm more I'm
definitely logical thinker but I'm I I I

for example I was never good at math at

uh that goes better with tournaments

uh that goes better with tournaments
compared to cash games. Do you have an

for example tournaments or in in a hand
that you played?

So basically in different phases of a

So basically in different phases of a
tournament you might want to completely

[2:13:53]

tournament you might want to completely
change the way you build a three range

[2:13:57]
change the way you build a three range

change the way you build a three range
based on uh if you are closer to a

going to uh do certain things in certain
boards uh in tournaments. Uh you can

compared to cash games. So this is why I

[2:15:00]
compared to cash games. So this is why I

compared to cash games. So this is why I
think uh that diversity of situations

[2:15:04]

think uh that diversity of situations
play with my strengths a bit more uh

[2:15:07]
play with my strengths a bit more uh

play with my strengths a bit more uh
than than cash games. That's what I

you will fall. Uh so so you also need to

[2:30:47]
you will fall. Uh so so you also need to

are the one uh feeling the pressure you

[2:30:53]

in half out without kind of taking that

[3:14:55]
in half out without kind of taking that

[3:14:55]
in half out without kind of taking that
kind of big leap. So, I think from your

[3:14:56]
kind of big leap. So, I think from your

[3:14:56]
kind of big leap. So, I think from your
stories, you've obviously been someone

[3:14:58]
stories, you've obviously been someone
who's experienced the same kind of

stuff and you've solved the problems on

[3:15:02]
stuff and you've solved the problems on

[3:15:02]
stuff and you've solved the problems on
the fly. Then over time, you found

systems and delegations that that makes

does SPR have on my strategy? And then
you take those concepts and you start

[3:33:09]
you take those concepts and you start

[3:33:09]
you take those concepts and you start
applying them. So it's a way more

[3:33:11]
applying them. So it's a way more
