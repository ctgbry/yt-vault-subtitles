[01:32]
your greatest poker year ever and many
more to follow
what we're going to discuss today
is how you got here and then we're
talking about your life
some fundamental knowledge on why you
have the life you have reflection

[01:45]
have the life you have reflection
forgiveness and change
uh i wanted to start here like most of
these presentations you would imagine
start with okay guys why are you here
today what do you want why do you want
it why are you gonna feel where you're
gonna succeed but i think that then
you're kind of missing the bigger
picture and then

[02:00]
picture and then
if you don't know a lot of points that
i'm gonna explain in point one two
then you're going to feel so i figured
let's start off with that we're going to
talk about who you actually are and what
you actually want
getting some clarity then we're going to
talk about your purpose purpose in life

[02:16]
talk about your purpose purpose in life
in general your beliefs your vision and
your goals
now we're going to talk about what do we
need to succeed
why do we feel and in the end it's
decision time aka we're going to commit
to what we said that we're going to do

[02:30]
to what we said that we're going to do
and i'll give you some final words okay
i'm going to blow open a bottle of
champagne actually that's actually not a
bad idea
i can't go too deep on every topic due
to time restrictions but if you want to
know more then go through the how to
become a more successful poker player
series that i gave in this

[02:46]
series that i gave in this
academy i love the stuff that we're
gonna talk about today the reason why we
feel reason why we succeed it's also
stuff that i talked about more in depth
in those webinars
also if you
are in the academy or in that bundle you
can ask questions on the discord channel
and i'll help you guys further out there

[03:02]
and i'll help you guys further out there
so
this is the ramble part how did you get
here
why do you have the life that you
currently have
where you are now
for the most part is the result of the

[03:15]
for the most part is the result of the
decisions you have made
so basically
you got exactly what you deserved
okay
now some
excuses might come out when you're like
yeah about what go again

[03:30]
yeah about what go again
90 of those things are probably just
quote push it and excuses then there are
some things that are actually true
right like circumstances were very much
out of our control but you can always
find a person that was in the same
circumstances but that turn it around

[03:45]
circumstances but that turn it around
into
a better reality than the reality of the
other person experiencing the same
event so it's always how we deal with
events that will shape our destiny okay
it's not the environment that shapes who

[04:00]
it's not the environment that shapes who
we are aka our identity but it's you who
creates your reality your identity and
your environment
okay
if you
there's a lot of you and i highlighted

[04:16]
there's a lot of you and i highlighted
it if you
want a different life
you must make different choices
so why do we make the choices we make
this is very important to get an
understanding of this so how did you get

[04:30]
understanding of this so how did you get
here
simple system
in life we encounter various events
okay
we then perceive
and label these events as either a good
event or a bad event a pleasant event or
a very painful event okay so what i

[04:47]
a very painful event okay so what i
wrote here it's not the event itself but
our perception which is based on our
conditionings and on our belief systems
we're not going to go too deep into that
because then we'll talk for another
couple hours
this perception the perception of the
event generates certain thoughts oh this

[05:02]
event generates certain thoughts oh this
is very pleasant oh this is not very
pleasant oh i like this oh i don't like
this oh i'm an idiot oh this is just you
know out of my control this is in my
control etc
when you have a certain thought
the response to a thought is a feeling

[05:17]
the response to a thought is a feeling
you cannot think about happy things and
feel bad at the same time and vice versa
try this at home it's true if you feel
bad you usually think about bad stuff
if you're good you usually don't think
about bad stuff so if you want to feel

[05:30]
about bad stuff so if you want to feel
better
think a lot about a lot of good things
and you actually feel better it's a it's
a simple step but it's not that simple
and that i will try to explain
these feelings then drive our actions
and the decisions we make

[05:45]
and the decisions we make
and as this cycle repeats it shapes who
you are as you become what you
repeatedly do an event we make a
decision new event we make a new
decision repeatedly repeatedly it
becomes we become who we are
due to our response to events

[06:02]
due to our response to events
all right
so we can conclude from this
that the person who makes good decisions
gets a great life good decisions equals
great life that's the simple math here
poor decisions equal a bad life

[06:17]
poor decisions equal a bad life
okay
why
do we make decisions
with our actions and decisions we try to
accomplish one or two things we i want
to experience pleasure
or we want to avoid pain it's literally

[06:31]
or we want to avoid pain it's literally
as simple as that if we go back to the
basics of the basics this is what
everyone wants in life this is what
everyone is changing one way or another
so your behavior usually has something
to do with this right
we experience things as pleasant

[06:46]
we experience things as pleasant
when they fulfill one of our human needs
and or are in line with our values
because it's not like everyone does
exactly the same things because
what we experience is pleasure what we
experience pain and what our needs are

[07:00]
experience pain and what our needs are
vary per person
this all starts with clarity okay how do
we gain clarity by asking questions and
being curious about what lays underneath
our feelings and behaviors here's a
question you can make a print screen
write it down whatever

[07:15]
write it down whatever
like i said we don't have enough time to
really go through all the questions but
this is a very important question to ask
yourself who are you
and then reflectively what do my actions
so far in life slash my career say about
what my values and what my human needs

[07:30]
what my values and what my human needs
are
recommended googling i wrote it down
here tony robbins human needs it has a
test human values probably also has some
sort of test so your values roll out you
can also have positive values negative
values and basically
you want to know your values so you can

[07:45]
you want to know your values so you can
make decisions which are in line with
your values and if you make decisions in
life in line with your values you feel
happy about yourself
now the reason
i started with this
okay reason we need to know and
understand ourselves before i ask you

[08:00]
understand ourselves before i ask you
what you want and why
is to prevent conflict in your goals
sometimes you might set a goal
okay
that again the small part of your brain
thinks is great idea but actually is not
in line with your values you have to

[08:15]
in line with your values you have to
make certain sacrifices that you don't
really want to make
next
what is your purpose and what are your
goals
okay
i will spoil this because in the end
there is only one purpose in life

[08:31]
there is only one purpose in life
which is to feel fulfilled and you can
say content satisfied happy however you
want to call it
okay we will have different missions and
different goals in life we want to
achieve and possess certain things but
it's all to serve this bigger purpose

[08:46]
it's all to serve this bigger purpose
you want to be happy what we acquire
will never make us happy
who we are
what we do day to day and who we will
become will determine our happiness
which is the end goal

[09:02]
which is the end goal
this is not a destination okay it's an
experience a state of being a way of
living you're grinding not to go
somewhere so what i always did and get
something but for the grind itself
and beautiful things happen when you can

[09:16]
and beautiful things happen when you can
get into the state it's the state of
abundance okay you're very happy with
what you have you don't need anything
else and from there you can play poker
with freedom with joy with creativity
okay
poker suddenly becomes great again so if

[09:31]
poker suddenly becomes great again so if
you experience a lot of negativity
around poker this is probably a fix for
you
we are happiest when we are trying to
actualize our potential remember muslim
spirit it was at the top
actualize our potential

[09:45]
actualize our potential
living as close to our true potential as
possible
only continuous development and growth
leave to lead to happiness and having
that is success in my opinion
all right

[10:00]
all right
so question
i said this in my opinion of course what
is your definition of success
i always tell like success is you
succeeding in your definition of success
not in my definition of success okay
another question

[10:16]
another question
knowing your values needs
and understanding your purpose and how
that looks for you
what is your current mission
the goal you are trying to accomplish
what are you fired up about so this is
basically you know what a lot of people
thought we would start with hey guys

[10:32]
thought we would start with hey guys
what are you fired up about wow yeah
let's all crash 2022 hey
discipline come on yeah work ethic work
hard work hard no that's this is this is
not one of these webinars
then the detected question cliche but

[10:45]
then the detected question cliche but
very important why do you want this
what is it going to give you
okay
so many questions i see here questions
is clarity my friend and with clarity
clarity is very important you know that
uh what's the what is that saying

[11:02]
uh what's the what is that saying
if i had to cut a tree i would spend six
hours shopping my ass x or something
basically asking questions and being
very clear
will make
you know you will you will start a
little bit later a week later maybe on
your poker journey this year

[11:16]
your poker journey this year
but it will be so much easier man you
will outperform yourself
10x
i guarantee
you have to be very clear and you really
need to want it
would be nice won't do it has to be a
goal that you're really fired up about

[11:32]
goal that you're really fired up about
okay
again this can maybe also be outside of
poker and then see okay how can poker
help me reach that other goal that's
fine as well
your new future needs to be in order to
change this is your new future needs to

[11:45]
change this is your new future needs to
be more compelling than your current
reality and compelling enough to say no
to distractions dopamine and fight
through the obstacles that will come in
your way
it's not going to be easy that's why
having a strong why is important because
you will face obstacles it will be hard

[12:02]
you will face obstacles it will be hard
okay
a reason why people don't
but why people give up is because they
simply don't want it enough
or is also this is actually more of a
reason why people don't get into action
their current reality is

[12:15]
their current reality is
it's not bad but it's just not great so
they're kind of in that there's not a
real necessity to change right if
there's a real necessity to change your
life really sucks and your current life
is associated with a lot of pain you
want to change
but if your current life is okay

[12:30]
but if your current life is okay
then we have to tap into some deeper
sources okay we have to raise the
necessity which we're going to do that's
a little exercise that we're actually
going to do in the webinar
so
in order to get
to
a new reality we have to change right

[12:46]
a new reality we have to change right
you cannot create a different reality as
the same person
in order to change you must change not
your environment okay your environment
aka your reality is a reflection of you
not the other way around

[13:02]
really get this because everyone gets
this the opposite way around
okay
so we have to create a different reality
changing is a matter of motivation

[13:15]
changing is a matter of motivation
necessity and not ability everyone can
change if i hold a gun to your hat and
say do this and it's something that you
were not doing you're gonna do it
because necessity is goddamn high right
because elsa put a trigger and you're
dead all right

[13:30]
dead all right
now this is very extreme
but there is a point where you start
moving there's a point where you take
action
to change then must be associated with
more pleasure than not changing would
much be associated with more pain this
is the key
formula for change basically remember

[13:46]
formula for change basically remember
all the way one of the first lights
we're always trying to chase pleasure
and avoid pain how can we
associate the current behavior that we
don't like with more pain than changing
into a new behavior the new behavior
needs to be more pleasure

[14:00]
okay a little question and for people
who went to previous uh webinars i've
i've asked this question before and i
think it's very strong that's why i
edited it again
if in one month from now so that's uh
end of january you will have to be

[14:15]
end of january you will have to be
playing day in and day out in games with
linus love
stefan which are two high stakes cash
game and bosses michael adamo and
tarantino mulder
high stakes mtt bosses how would you

[14:30]
high stakes mtt bosses how would you
approach studying preparing and playing
poker
think about this question
if
what i'm doing here basically i'm
raising the necessity because now a lot
of people are like oh
oh yeah well okay yes this is my
opposition then obviously yeah yeah i

[14:45]
opposition then obviously yeah yeah i
should probably do this different i
should probably do this because you're
trying to beat them
and a lot of people
okay
they haven't set a goal not high enough
for them to raise that necessity
their goal is
to pay for their bills
or

[15:00]
or
to pay for their rent
but as long as they can do it then why
would they raise their standards there's
no necessity
so you could then
raise your expenses and rent a very
expensive flat that basically you will
run out of money in three months so you
have to become very innovative and try

[15:16]
have to become very innovative and try
to figure out ways to make more money
which often actually will help don't
recommend it
if you do do it don't come to me
you get the point but many players wait
for that situation yeah okay i will do
this but i will do that when that's

[15:31]
this but i will do that when that's
actually the case
and again then they're waiting for the
environment to change for them to change
and as i just stated it doesn't work
like that you will never get there
unless you start doing the things
necessary to beat these games now

[15:46]
necessary to beat these games now
because then you actually do things
different
than the rest of your competition
and if you do the same things as your
competition you will get the rest of
your the same as the rest of your
competition so you're not out work them
so you have to do things different

[16:00]
so you have to do things different
do you think it's reasonable goal
to reach certain stakes on line 5 10 10
20 for example and switch to live poker
to play higher stakes with the skills
you learn playing yeah i think it's a
reasonable goal but again not really
focused on i want to reach 5 10 10 20
focus on what person do i have to become

[16:16]
focus on what person do i have to become
and make goals around that then the
result will be that you will get to 5 10
10 20.
okay
people get that backwards usually but
it's good to set a high goal right
because that that raises the necessity

[16:30]
because that that raises the necessity
okay high goal like i said i asked you
you're going to play with lions is
different i mean it's a high goal you're
gonna have to show up
and then what happens if you set high
goals necessity rises and you become
results for you come become creative
okay so let's say i would do how would i
do that this that has been a huge

[16:45]
do that this that has been a huge
transformation in my career uh for the
people who didn't watch my youtube video
i explained it there as well that i was
just also grinding i didn't have
a clear direction or a conscious goal i
was just clicking for the sake of
clicking i'm a poker player i show up i
click right and i just want to pay my

[17:01]
click right and i just want to pay my
bills until i teamed up with explode and
he said we're going to become the best
and i was like okay okay then i thought
what what what does the best do
how does that look on a day to day basis
and i started doing that
and then my reality changed because i
became a different person

[17:17]
became a different person
right what do we need to make it
more likely that you will succeed
what do we need to succeed
it starts all with energy
low energy equals a bad state equals bad

[17:31]
low energy equals a bad state equals bad
decisions and remember make a lot of
decisions that are bad you have a poor
life
high energy good state good decision so
energy is the key to everything
when you're tired do you make great
decisions let's say you're tired and

[17:45]
decisions let's say you're tired and
hungry you walk into the supermarket but
you're on a diet
are you gonna fight the resistance no
you're gonna buy [ __ ] right that's how
it works
so what determines energy when you have
ing things are easy everyone can relate
to this you start moving and make good

[18:00]
to this you start moving and make good
decisions and since your reality is the
consequence of your decisions pretty
damn important if you ask me
fatigue makes cowards and failures out
of all of us i thought that was a great
quote
so now obviously you're asking yourself

[18:15]
so now obviously you're asking yourself
well mr wacko where does energy come
from
what energy comes from
internally which is your mindsets your
belief systems how you respond to a
certain event how you perceive certain
events right then you have the victim
mentalities that think life is against

[18:31]
mentalities that think life is against
them people that trying to fight things
that are out of their control costs a
lot of energy right
they get challenged they get a downswing
they feel very down about themselves
they stay stuck in the past in the
dowsing or
costing a lot of energy other people

[18:45]
costing a lot of energy other people
might experience the same downswing but
they're like hey damn and get fired up
about it so their response to that
downswing actually generates more energy
okay they have a more positive mindset
physiology
usually i try to not talk about sleep

[19:00]
usually i try to not talk about sleep
eat move because then everyone goes like
oh yeah we know but i hope
i hope that the way i explain it now it
starts to make sense if you sleep well
if you eat and if you move
you have more energy you make better
decisions

[19:15]
decisions
equals a better life okay
you understand now why it's actually
important right
it all starts with energy that's why
this is my point number one
they build and reinforce momentum
forward motion plus attention is energy

[19:31]
forward motion plus attention is energy
is emotion okay
momentum is key i'll give you guys some
tips on momentum strive towards living
as your new identity that's what we
concluded that's after you've reflected
that you should now know who am i being

[19:45]
that you should now know who am i being
and how do i want to show up today
okay
if you don't know this you will be faced
if you don't know where you're going
why and what your identity is you will
have so much decisions to make in a day

[20:00]
have so much decisions to make in a day
and at the end of the day you'll be
tired and you'll make bad decisions
okay but if you know exactly where
you're going what you're supposed to do
and how you want to show up
you face the situation and you know how
to do it how to deal with it it's value
and identity driven decision making okay

[20:17]
and identity driven decision making okay
then when you recognize that you've done
something which is in line with your new
identity recognize and celebrate that
progress build on this be proud
reinforce that positive behavior hey hey
i done it that's like me

[20:32]
i done it that's like me
you you feel it it's also i said it in a
very very energetic way but i also
actually get excited when i notice like
hey yeah that that is indeed like me
especially when i think it's hard and
you still did it
you know step yourself on the shoulder
okay a lot of people

[20:46]
okay a lot of people
miss this part but remember they do
everything with their thinking self with
that little one percent less than one
percent part of the body and they ignore
the rest
questions
what gives me energy

[21:00]
what gives me energy
second
how can i get and sustain more of this
the sustaining is
you know re
sh
the um getting more of this is
recognizing when you make progress
towards your goal right we talked about
this you chunk the goals and pieces

[21:15]
this you chunk the goals and pieces
and sustain is to
um to tap into why
frequently for example on the right i
have a whiteboard there's a mountain
okay with that
long-term goal over there and i have
little
mountain peaks
a little flak on it and that's a that's

[21:31]
a little flak on it and that's a that's
a short-term goal so i see it i also see
it in my primer so at times when it's
hard i'm like why am i doing this i know
exactly why i'm doing this okay
what because it's gonna get hard and
this is the point it's gonna get hard
okay it's not easy

[21:46]
okay it's not easy
it's gonna get hard it's gonna take long
what cost me energy and how can i reduce
this from my life
energy guys very key without energy
we're all lost
a clear direction

[22:00]
a clear direction
necessity and focus where am i going why
is this more important i said more
important than the distractions that
come up on daily basis clarity is power
i saw
someone asking
so many questions

[22:15]
so many questions
the more questions you ask the more
clear it becomes and clarity is power
direction and identity is what guides
your decision the clearer you are
involved the easier decisions in life
become as you already made the decisions
and you can resist temptation people
then think wow you have so much

[22:31]
then think wow you have so much
willpower discipline but like if you're
very clear
on your direction and what your identity
is you have so much less decisions in
your life okay
the same people that you think are wow
they're very distant they would also
feel if they didn't have that it's just

[22:46]
feel if they didn't have that it's just
a trick
okay
accept the consequences of your decision
now we're coming to to to the point that
i was talking about
focus on what you will gain
in the future instead of what you lose
or miss out on now

[23:01]
or miss out on now
if you don't decide
okay you have a decision we're talking
about twitch playing poker but what do i
want
if you don't decide time and your
environment will decide for you who
doubts does not succeed

[23:15]
doubts does not succeed
okay i will give you an extra sheet
all decisions we make and don't make so
indecision have consequences
a reason why a decision is hard it's
because if you make a pros and cons list
yeah
they're quite equal right their heart

[23:32]
they're quite equal right their heart
and they have consequences and that fact
is never going to go away so then you
can either
choose and accept the consequences or
not make a decision
and keep living in pain
but yeah it has consequences

[23:47]
but yeah it has consequences
safety is an illusion i also wrote down
there's also some fear which is the next
point then we'll do a little exercise
and maybe after that it will become a
little bit clearer clearer to you
actually in that exercise that we're
going to do i actually made the decision
to start poke ambition so it's a good

[24:01]
to start poke ambition so it's a good
exercise shout out to miss tony robbins
when you decided on a big goal
our unconsciousness will start scanning
the world for ways to achieve this goal
it's very important for example let's

[24:16]
it's very important for example let's
say you're a lower snake player you hear
stuff about cfps
you're just you know doing your own
thing and they suddenly set a very high
goals okay i really want to reach it and
then you see a cfp advertisement again
you're like cfp i actually my goal is to

[24:31]
you're like cfp i actually my goal is to
become one of the best actually maybe a
cfp is not a bad decision before that
you would have also seen that
advertisement of the cfp
but i mean you didn't set that goal so
they were like oh yeah cfp
it's a saying that you know if you're

[24:45]
it's a saying that you know if you're
overweight and you drive past the gym
and your goal is not to lose weight you
don't recognize it when he goes to lose
weight and you see the gym you're like
jim lose weight hey that's in line with
my goals
so because
your eyes or your brain if you want to
see it you see so much things there's so
much information we filter so if you

[25:02]
much information we filter so if you
tell your brain hey brain this is our
goal go filter
for opportunities
right go filter for opportunities and
then suddenly you will see opportunities
come along which are in line with your
goals then the next step is it reaches
my fear

[25:16]
my fear
that you're gonna
grab those opportunities
okay because a lot of people then talk
about yeah i was lucky in my career i
noticed that for example in the podcast
so far in the three episodes there was
lucky involved
i personally don't really believe that's
true i think other people would have

[25:31]
true i think other people would have
seen the same opportunities or the
opportunities would have presented
themselves but they didn't set that goal
so that they didn't saw it or they did
see it but were afraid to take it so
there's there's a difference there but
this is why setting a big goal
is so important you start to think

[25:46]
is so important you start to think
resort innovative like okay how can i
reach that and you start to see
opportunities
now why do we often still feel so often
and how can when we prevent that from
happening we will feel often but we
don't let that stop us and give up it

[26:01]
don't let that stop us and give up it
shows us
one way how not to do it
i think this was from tim ferriss the
pharisees failing as a data point that
we can learn from
maybe there's some data data fanatics
here in the group
yeah if you have a lot of data

[26:16]
yeah if you have a lot of data
and if you try a lot to fill a lot you
gain a lot of data with a lot of data
you can make better decisions
and now we get to the good point fear
what stops us from chasing our true
purpose and it keeps us in our

[26:30]
purpose and it keeps us in our
comfort zone this is it fear
okay
boo
fear
is what kept or keeps us alive
basically the fear is a response that
the body has that says danger danger get
out

[26:45]
out
remember we are made to survive not to
strife
of the first slides
you don't experience fear
because you are you you experience fear
because you are human sometimes people

[27:00]
because you are human sometimes people
use this and say yeah but i'm afraid and
they say okay yeah so am i right so is
everyone
anyone who's not afraid is both stupid
and lying i think it was an mma fighter
who said that so
you know
it's not going anywhere so we need to

[27:16]
it's not going anywhere so we need to
learn to live with it the more attention
you give it the bigger it gets okay fear
pops up people pay a lot of attention to
fear feed unfair and then fear only gets
bigger and then at some point you're
paralyzed and you cannot make a decision
sounds familiar i think everyone has

[27:31]
sounds familiar i think everyone has
been here sometimes
the things we want most in life and this
is kind of the problem
come with fear
because we care
if we don't care there's no fear
fear means you are on the right path

[27:47]
fear means you are on the right path
okay for the
i want to give an example here
for the guys
i think i don't think the girls will
maybe understand this but when you for
example are in a club and you want to
approach
a lovely woman

[28:01]
a lovely woman
the more beautiful the woman is or the
more if you're attracted to this woman
the more important it becomes so the
more fear you have stepping towards this
woman
whereas if your friend says hey can you
can you talk to that girl over there
you're not attracted to her at all like

[28:15]
you're not attracted to her at all like
oh yeah no problem
because you don't want it you don't care
if you feel right so the more you want
it
the more fear exists
when you feel that that means you care
and that you're on the right path
you are chasing that purpose remember
purpose is actualizing one's true

[28:31]
purpose is actualizing one's true
potential
naturally it's going to be outside of
your comfort zone so fear will be part
of that so in order to reach or live in
line with our purpose we need to conquer
fear
you care about what you're doing which
is a good thing your body is aware of it

[28:46]
is a good thing your body is aware of it
so it's generating more energy preparing
itself for battle
okay
it's like oh [ __ ] something is gonna
happen let's prepare
fear feeds on time and can only take
over when you are low in energy to come

[29:00]
over when you are low in energy to come
back to the bar example
the longer you wait
approaching the girl unless you start
taking shots okay that doesn't count the
harder it's gonna get
so fair fits on time and can only take
over when you're low in energy comes
back again to energy energy number one

[29:17]
back again to energy energy number one
if you're low in energy make bad
decisions you let fear in
that's why it's all about energy
we need to change so first part of our
life what we're gonna do is we change
our interpretation of this energy from
fear to excitement remember something

[29:30]
fear to excitement remember something
happened your body generates energy it's
like hey something's happening let's
generate energy the state of uh no i
want to say arousal maybe i'm too much
in the in the bar fought now but a state
of uh uh uh yeah a chemical cocktail
starts to be made so we feel in a

[29:46]
starts to be made so we feel in a
certain way
and that energy itself is neutral
okay it's it's our perception that
determines if we are afraid or excited
okay we're gonna now this comes from the
book the alchemist from paulo coelho

[30:01]
book the alchemist from paulo coelho
uh he says we have to be an alchemist
and we
have to interpret that energy as
wow i'm so excited because you are but
you're conditioned that that's fear that
you're actually afraid
and fear
stops us from making us go forward

[30:18]
stops us from making us go forward
the last thing you want to do when you
feel afraid is to calm down we want to
reinterpret that energy we are excited
okay
so a challenge arises we feel a certain
energy
we then label that

[30:31]
we then label that
energy we have an interpretation
if that's fear we stop but if we
interpret it that's excitement it's go
time
fear is not going anywhere we have to
learn how to deal with fear
and interpret it differently another

[30:45]
and interpret it differently another
so what are we afraid of
this is the time that everyone has to
pay attention because we're going to do
a little exercise
we are afraid of failure it's usually
one of the main fears
and
we're afraid that we're not going to be

[31:00]
we're afraid that we're not going to be
enough and that we don't have what it
takes
okay we're also afraid of success
especially when you're not prepared for
it you have a bad association with
successful people for example your dad
might have already always told you when
you're little these [ __ ] rich people

[31:15]
you're little these [ __ ] rich people
uh and you created a bad association
with rich people and
if you don't know that you start to
sabotage your own success because you
don't want to get rich you're afraid of
success
you're afraid to be criticized
or you're afraid of not being lost these
are kind of the three main fears

[31:31]
are kind of the three main fears
now i'm gonna ask you guys a question
pay attention
because we're gonna do this now not
later
what if you would really
really
commit to making it this year
right we already kind of maybe already
followed a little bit about how does it

[31:46]
followed a little bit about how does it
look if i have to play against those
guys
and how does that look like what can you
do
okay you could take like uh 30 seconds
write it down think about it
what would it look like what would it
look like if you would really commit

[32:01]
look like if you would really commit
sharing a chat with dumbbells there now
that's the result of you really
committing right
all right

[32:17]
now my next question to you
is this
why
is that
so scary you can write it in the chat
what you feel what you think

[32:31]
what you feel what you think
what you experience why is that so scary
you're going all in
why is that so scary
