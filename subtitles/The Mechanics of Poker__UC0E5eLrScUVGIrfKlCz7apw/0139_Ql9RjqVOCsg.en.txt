oh there's the ace
maybe i saved money here but it's very
unlikely eddie is asus or ace king
they handled trapping we had seven doozy
we just fired a flop i
assume would say same hand or trap
big bad
aces
thanks
time
okay
knitting fold ninty full
nitty fold nitiful got in a bit late so
um just slowly warming up
you know what they say i mean and day is
jared man
now jared man it's tara tendler see
that's how confused i am that's how not
warmed up i am
you don't do a warming up then
the first half hour of your session is
the warming up so let's start it slow
you know float there with the back to
straight flush draw
obviously get there
not really the best of turn
i could pee again but that's then hoping
he would shut down
with queen jack or jack then
that's a bit of the mistake
just
bad
also it's a recreational so let's say
the river is a jack or ten or if we need
jax now he makes a second pair is he
really going to explode the river
very good board for me open point two
28 which is quite good i think eight
three no backup equity let's say at
eight seven or something i don't mind
squeezing another bat same with 85
check
and now
going to
fire out
the client is a

all that good stuff
uh
tough spot straight of the bed here with
pocket eights
there's a one third i think we call but
not very happy about it
checks
he should not really
the kind of i would definitely bet this
was quite high i go for a bet but
i would not be surprised
hello much better back jacks
spanish
the gulf is still recovering over the
cough definitely going to raise here
a little bit protection a little bit of
value
feel the power
you feel my power
feel my power now i have to think about
it 30bps
probably soon 20. yeah level
five
here
probably going to mix the turn between
small button big bed
kind of like the tent in a big bed
go to obviously stewie here with the guy
not
called
it is not great because it was actually
one of the offshoots that i was actually
ahead against
and now basically worse kings are the
king the king exuded no less combos
yeah 20bp okay let's throw us a 20bp
poker
you can do it wacko
back go back go actually i've also taken
in consideration um
and i also actually have a bounty on my
head quite a small seabed
definitely a spot where you should add
um
more unnatural bluffs
i think a7
it's really it's really a spot that
really depends on how aggressive
your opponent
this
would much rather call king jack
he stands suited here can do
any of the up let's go for it
receive it here
a board that cannot do too much debating
on
i think i'm still just gonna do it
that's quite close quite let's see
four
seven sticks it's an okay spot to throw
the bets with my extract hand
not gonna do too much betting on this
board
face a barrel
also fine thing
quite close
and if you're gonna jack i'm gonna check
i was hoping for an eight and a nine ten
of course
here yeah this is uh gotta be owen
though i'm not that thrilled about it
place a bet on the river it's pretty
weird spot in my opinion
that's a really weird spot
because why would you play a 7 this way
i think a 7 just wants to check the
river
six doesn't really bet the turn
he calls queen jack off
my own and he rivers a [ __ ] queen are
you kidding me
are you [ __ ] kidding me
i'm gonna make the call here
a bit of a weird spot but
he has five four
and we had three pair four five six uh
how many pairs did we have so we did
something genius
and we got a bad bad beat so what did we
first do we first celebrated
[Music]
i'm [ __ ] fair man play like a [ __ ]
genius to get down here every [ __ ]
day i think i'm gonna burn this [ __ ]
place down if i don't win this [ __ ]
trick okay okay okay okay sir
what you gonna do what you gonna do what
you gonna do when pocket queens comes to
you
probably jammed some of the time but
uh
are you kidding me twice
what the [ __ ] is going on do you want to
make 2022

let's go bucket queens
not good sir
we went our money back here oh jinx it
waco why did you have to open your mouth
why did you have to open your mouth
you know what they say lee
everybody loves a chop pot you know one
of my mottos i also explained the
mechanics poker look ahead
and already saw that coming
no actually
didn't like the fact that the
netherlands has no sunlight
sunlight for me like
in the end it's all about life if you
like having the h4
ah
flop 3 better like having the four
spades from [ __ ] two pairs
and i don't think he has a screen but he
can have king queen
it's a very bad turn
maybe if i had a heart to go with my
hand i would have bet but we don't
and i think after he just calling the
him just going through that
and looks very much like
uh
king queen
i do actually think a jam is quite good
here
oh whack oh you said he had key queen
there you go the [ __ ]
yeah don't try this at home kids
oh dried is at home
okay
this is this is getting spicy this is
getting spicy this is spicy as [ __ ]
spice
spice on one hand
i'm an avid fan of spice
on another hand
sometimes it's things are too spicy and
they're not no longer edible unless
you've lost your taste to covid
now i did not lose my taste to kofi but
my throat
quite [ __ ] up
okay so that was uh yeah
as they like to call it uh incredibly
strong and aggressive player i'm an
aggressive player yes kevin you saw that
decking
seven
ducey i just show them drunken style and
i think it's good for poker like bring
some fun enjoyment
i want to show can i show
oh that's a great flop i get that show
i think this board is preservative of a
ten percent when it's pluto
definitely look at the barrel
or make a flush which in that case we
also barrel
i don't actually mind checking
actually
but i want to show my hand why can't i
show the [ __ ] hand
he thinks i have seven dudes
he's like oh this [ __ ] can have
seven dudes
then i did show him the seven deuce
ah show show
i'm about to turn here with this queen
just hoping to get a full straight away
from like pocket deuces or [ __ ] fives
not gonna go too big as i am unkept
uh i'm kept four sixes king jack
all hands in its range not really in my
range
here check back the a4 gonna call the
turn
and he indeed goes for the huge check
race as we are kept i think we have
baldo
here we face at that
trying to figure out which hands are
good to call with probably ace king
way better than a4
here prefer an ace which is good for us
as if yet spare
enough ace king
in the check
as i think
there's not really much value he went
for the check race with pocket deuces
okay okay sir
very uh
it's a very strong play
idiot players call raises with queen 10
they don't even know how to spell poker
i mean
so dumb
that's why you play this baby money
limit you [ __ ] donk but hey who cares
when we can just get it in with
ea's king go guys ace king what the [ __ ]
let's gamble baby girl here we go baby
girl
here we go okay
come on [ __ ]
you had
jax oh my god
king
king king king king come on
[ __ ] it
it just folded
by four and open for me regardless
my favorite hand but wacko didn't you
just say that
five six is your favorite listen me five
six five
[Music]
low frequency bet here for me
but i'm not really going to bet on a lot
but this hand okay
here
i think actually i'm going to bed one
big client am i
unexpected
you're definitely calling
very good term for him
there's five
you know that's actually a very bad but
it's basically you want him to bluff h5
h3
i think there's not much else we
for us to do than call because we still
have to touch like a board bear a heart
but in the same time you allow him to
play reasonably perfect but that's the
lamb as well yeah two pair
shout out to gto wizard
for providing us with the solution
a little donkey donkey donkey
crazy [ __ ] tense he should not race
too often here
i think people
usually raise his hands a little bit too
often
then you can apply quite a fresh
rebelling
yet
five steps which eat free bedding we had
diamonds
it goes for experience
should actually raise back some time
that really happens so i think general
people race a little bit more often
especially with those hands and then
when i three bet they don't come over
the top of enough so i think that do a
lot of dunk everybody
you're gonna turn
abc always be checkered okay
five seven
those three quarters i mean the audi sbr
we're going half pot so it's reasonably
similar
haircut looking good my man thank you
very much sir actually i have to go to
the hairdresser
the river was
the deuce where we took it
five seven
sometimes
you definitely don't have hearts we
didn't have heart so that's good so
actually we're checking 61 percent let's
say river was uh
i liked an eight for example the gem one
oh wait an eight makes you straight i
like a seven as well
okay five three
then nine
nine we check less so actually it is
indeed the deuce
does indeed
reduce our
we've betting a four
a four is quite good as well
because we probably have more forex
five
yeah i was gonna say great complete
cards probably just range betting
not like it's a fist bump jam so it's
not that bad
don't make anything
we have four blocker score but we always
have four blockers for you look at our
no mate hands
no man no mate hands always have a poor
blocker score which is actually a new
function
but yeah this is not really a spot where
you can actually have blockers so it's
usually also
a hard spot to bluff
ace high i guess is it okay blocker
score
three the highest is gonna get
but aces never really raises the flop so
really see what's the point
yeah it's a hard spot to find blossom
because you just need to yolo but i
i just choked because it was a deuce
which
you know
it's fair but like i said
don't we sometimes three bets
flop would do three or some
three
but i guess more with a four because
he's more likely to race fours than
deuce
or three or something that's why the
four was also better than the two
the five seven i think it's well played
whatever we should have at least rolled
the river
that's it
