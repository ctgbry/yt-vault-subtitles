[00:00]
and chirpy now actually goes all in
shout out to chirpy
chirpy ain't afraid man he just throws
his whole stacking

[00:16]
his whole stacking
do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo hi
there boys and girls and welcome back to
another episode of

[00:30]
another episode of
high stakes hero where i'm going to be
reviewing some
hands that were played at high stakes
and in today's high stakes hero we're
going to be taking a closer look at
hands played by
chirpy box okay this is a player from
the uk
seen him around already for quite a long

[00:46]
seen him around already for quite a long
time actually uh
usually when people are from the uk yeah
they can actually be
from anywhere a lot of spanish players
there for example
he does have like a boca junior shirt if
i'm not mistaking
so it could be maybe argentinian as well

[01:00]
so it could be maybe argentinian as well
however i do see them usually just
continue living in argentina but hey a
lot of cool stories bro
let's get into the hands
so the first hand chirpy opens under the

[01:16]
so the first hand chirpy opens under the
gun
an angry ogre decides to through better
small blind
both players have probably played
together i don't know how many hundreds
of thousands hands because they've both
been playing for
i don't know at least like the last five
years that i know of

[01:32]
years that i know of
so we call three bet and angry ogre
decides to check which i think he's
going to do quite frequently on this
board as he's probably not three betting
five sixes sevens and eight
all that often he could be raising that
and calling that to a tree bet

[01:46]
and calling that to a tree bet
so it is a board that you have kind of a
disadvantage on he's probably already
folding a lot of offsuit combinations
were angry over
good for example tree but i have like
king queen off which is gonna miss the
flop so i think
spot where you should do quite some

[02:00]
spot where you should do quite some
checking
uh angry ogre does actually go for the
czech race
um hands that this could make sense with
uh obviously
very strong over pairs i do think it's
the spot where we should maybe be a
little bit careful with our lower over
pairs

[02:15]
pairs
so like tens and jacks could maybe feels
a little bit like an overplay
as chirpy himself can obviously also
still have
jackson queens in these positions so i
would now say that angry ogre is kind of
saying that he has
kings aces i think kings and aces could

[02:31]
kings aces i think kings and aces could
be played as way queens
queens is then already a little bit a
little bit dicey maybe we should just
check call queens a little bit more
often than check raise it
uh in terms of blocks he could maybe
check ray's hand like a sweat suit i
think actually that is
an okay play as let's say for example

[02:46]
an okay play as let's say for example
chirpy
stabs a hand like jack queen of hearts
and we check raise ace five and defaults
that's an okay result right it has some
shoulder value
but i don't think we get to really
realize that shonen value as we're
probably gonna get bluffed off our hand

[03:00]
probably gonna get bluffed off our hand
and i don't think we're always calling
down right so then just using it as
like a bluff and a blocker to a set and
to like five six suited i think
and to maybe pocket eight but i think
unlikely could actually be that he just
never forwards in these positions
um but i think that would actually be a

[03:17]
um but i think that would actually be a
fine play in terms of loss maybe as well
like jack queen of hearts
i think jack queen of hearts is a good
step and a good check race for both
obviously bluff
blocking jackson queens having equity
versus seven eight
tenths i think that would be a fine play

[03:31]
tenths i think that would be a fine play
i would usually proceed here by
actually it's quite interesting i love
these hands by the way i'm also seeing
for the first time
so it's not like i've done a great
analysis and tell you exactly what bio
does i'm just going to give you my
thoughts on the hand

[03:45]
thoughts on the hand
and then afterwards we can discuss
further in the comments down below maybe
i'll
if there's a lot of commotion we can
maybe look at what the solver does i'm
just going to tell you what i think of
both place
it's interesting here what chirpy does
there is some incentive to

[04:00]
there is some incentive to
fast play some of our hands let's say
for example we have a set
because we just named queen's king's ace
is probably going with it and we don't
really want the board to run out scary
but the other tie on the other side then
we should probably also maybe bluff some

[04:15]
we should probably also maybe bluff some
seven and eight some of the time or
basically just re-raise let him fall
jack queen
uh basically always get to realize her
equity and not get bluffed
so i'm actually not really sure how in
position here plays but i would imagine
some fast playing
therapy calls

[04:32]
which actually i mean if a seven or
eight drills off there's only two cards
and then we still have tension queens so
actually i know actually i'll take that
back i think
we can just call here quite often even

[04:45]
we can just call here quite often even
with a set i don't think we have to
worry that much
and just for example right now he could
have picked up
a hand like jacqueline suited and then
we can maybe now get some value from
that
angry ogre decides to go all in
quite an aggressive play it's a spot

[05:00]
quite an aggressive play it's a spot
where i do think people will
lack it's it's quite hard to find a lot
of bluffs jackson suited jackman suited
were maybe like some natural hands that
you could be bluffing with
so i think actually the sizing is maybe
a little bit overdone
um and i think he's kind of putting us

[05:15]
um and i think he's kind of putting us
in a position where we can just call
with
a set and basically fold the rest which
obviously as a strategy for angry ogre i
don't think that's a great idea let's
say we do have
pocket queens as terpy it's a very puke
type of spot
especially if you have queens with a

[05:30]
especially if you have queens with a
heart for example queen ten of hearts
maybe could be a czech race or king
queen of hearts could be a checklist for
any yogurt is not jamming
so i think actually this bed is maybe a
little bit too big i would have liked to
see maybe a half pot or something i
think that's
probably a better a better sizing to

[05:45]
probably a better a better sizing to
choose and if i was sharpie i would now
probably do quite a lot of folding and
just fold seven and eight also if we
have eights now
uh no if we have sevens or eight is
maybe not even deadlife anymore if he
does have queen 10 suited

[06:00]
does have queen 10 suited
so yeah if i'm chirpy i'm just gonna
call here with a set
and basically fold the rest and if angry
ogre did
show up with enough bluffs that i'm now
maybe uh
overfolding yeah and he he managed to

[06:15]
overfolding yeah and he he managed to
find a lot of loss in this position
exploits that then
i think he deserved the pot that would
be my strategy
but i would say grog is quite strong and
i would say when chirpy calls
i'm not really sure i don't really know
trippy that well i would just call

[06:30]
trippy that well i would just call
strong but let's see
he had kings actually so yeah i don't
think he's forbidden that much
in these positions then like i said
definitely jack stands be very careful
if you're an angry
shoes and groga showed up with the
queens himself
which i don't really like on the turn i

[06:46]
which i don't really like on the turn i
think he's
kind of overplaying his hand to be
honest um
and the money goes in our hero because
we're rooting for miss chirpy here we're
rooting for mr trippy with the bogus
shirt
go go bokas wins the nice little first

[07:00]
go go bokas wins the nice little first
pot of the high six hero of trippy box
we open this is a 3.5 x strategy
i'm not really sure if he uses a mixed
strategy this is something that for
example i like to do when i use a mix
than my raising range i don't mind

[07:16]
than my raising range i don't mind
opening a little bit bigger
villain calls with 2 8 king flop
we decided to go for a big bet which
is definitely possible on a two-tone
board villain calls

[07:30]
board villain calls
and we see an eight it's probably going
to be a high frequency check for chirpy
after using a big bad strategy
the ojin calls uh decides to bet
i think his sizing is fine
probably could mix in some over bats as

[07:45]
probably could mix in some over bats as
there's quite a lot of hands that could
now check call so let's say for example
you're in chirpy shoes
probably forced to do quite a lot of
checking on the eight turn after betting
big on the flop
so let's say we do have an eight
probably chirpy has still quite a lot of
flush drawers that are calling
regardless you have quite a lot of king

[08:00]
regardless you have quite a lot of king
x so i think
rangers range i think we should
definitely also use some bigger bets
here
uh maybe only over bats and then
probably
like the only hand that i can really
think of that likes this sizing is maybe
king jack
king 10 um but i think there's also a

[08:17]
king 10 um but i think there's also a
lot of marriage in just checking
and letting her have like 9 10 suited in
or something because those hands have
zero percent equity
so also i think a benefit of having a
big bad strategy here is let's say we do
have an eight
and he has nine six of clubs he's

[08:32]
and he has nine six of clubs he's
probably just pulled uh forced to fold
on the turn and he's still calling a
king
so i think he should probably be using a
bigger sizing here with this range
chirpy calls there is a six

[08:47]
therapy checks the oven goes for three
quarters again which again i think is an
interesting
sizing however now the river does
completely flush so
like i said i think chirpy is going to
check out quite some flushes on the turn

[09:01]
check out quite some flushes on the turn
as well
um so i do understand the downsides here
if we do have for example
an eight okay now chirpy decides to go
in
so we're rooting for a hero to to to
have a good hand here

[09:15]
have a good hand here
doj now is in a little bit of a tough
spot
if he has an eight he now probably has a
bluff catcher unless he maybe has ace
eight maybe sherpy is
playing ace eight the same way so i
would definitely cause ace eight
if i'm the only shoes when we go lower

[09:30]
if i'm the only shoes when we go lower
in our eight acts it becomes quite dicey
um probably having like queen eight with
the queen of clubs
with the queen of diamonds or something
are good hands to call with
i think um any ace 8 and then your queen

[09:45]
i think um any ace 8 and then your queen
axe
your 8x i would look to have a diamond
with my hand
in terms of chirpy a good hand to be
bluffing here with obviously you want to
be looking at
let's say i had like ace diamonds uh
queen of hearts for example something

[10:01]
queen of hearts for example something
with the ace of diamonds would make a
lot of sense and then like a high card
with it
so that rocking like some of his
stronger adax
actually that doesn't really matter here
so the second card i think is a little
bit unrelevant
maybe ace and diamond deuce would be a

[10:15]
maybe ace and diamond deuce would be a
great candidate ace and diamond six uh
is it time six we don't really have or
not with the checkout
is a diamond deuce if he would have
opened that
that i think is okay candidate
um asus maybe i think aces with the ace

[10:31]
um asus maybe i think aces with the ace
of diamonds actually is a fine bluff
ace king with the ace of diamonds is a
fine bluff yeah i think those
would be probably the bloss that you're
going for right
so did chirpy show up with a bluff
that's now the question

[10:45]
that's now the question
nope trippy showed up with the pocket
kings and the ocean called with the
seven eight
even having the seven of clubs i don't
really like this
that much i think maybe it had like six
seven of clubs or something could check
all turn check race river
in terms of bluffs so having a six like

[11:01]
in terms of bluffs so having a six like
eight six o'clock section is a fine
bluff for chirpy as well
um i just don't think we should bat call
without a diamond i think here
and chirpy i think played his hand fine
went for quite
a big bet on the flop with pocket kings

[11:15]
a big bet on the flop with pocket kings
i would probably just bat
one third but overall we want a nice
little 2.3 k pot
moving up stakes 25 50
mr poker in the house shout out to team
poker ambition

[11:32]
morocco opens the bottom we threw that
from the
small blind all these guys are high six
regulars
get a call very connected port
let's see what chirp it does derpy goes

[11:45]
let's see what chirp it does derpy goes
for the check which is something that's
quite
frequent on these type of textures um
general very connected ports when you're
deep you
don't necessarily want to get a lot of
money in straight away
so trippy goes for a check call line

[12:00]
so trippy goes for a check call line
which is quite
conservative i think mariuka can still
have quite
a big variety of hands but chirpy when
he's checked calling at 109.8
two-tone i think we can already kind of
range down i think hands that makes
sense are like ac suited s9 suited ace

[12:15]
sense are like ac suited s9 suited ace
10 in general
also maybe like some draws like king
queen king jack that don't want to bat
and get raised up their hand
i think you should know probably already
just check fold a hand like ace king
um even probably with a heart even
though that's maybe a little bit weak
but ace jack is a draw his queen is a

[12:31]
but ace jack is a draw his queen is a
draw
so i would have might just check folding
ace king straight away if he had
let's say pocket jacks or punk queens i
think he could just check race
i think that's fine even if you beat
yourself quite of equity
kings and asus i will probably just
prefer check calling and waiting one

[12:46]
prefer check calling and waiting one
street and then if the turn is a deuce
and he barrels that's probably then the
point where we start doing some raising
kind of depends a little bit
it still feels quite quite loose-ish so

[13:00]
it still feels quite quite loose-ish so
don't mind just check on it down
especially if you have a hand like
pocket aces
there is an ace interesting car that we
could actually introduce a leading range
here
as i just said i think ace eight ace
nine ace ten are definitely in a check

[13:15]
nine ace ten are definitely in a check
call range and they're probably in the
checkpack range of maruka
we could have also had ace queen which
could also be the checkmark range of
maruka so i don't mind a small lead here
um but
on the same time uh eighths ninths
tenths uh

[13:30]
tenths uh
very likely for maruka a straight is
still very likely for maruka so
yeah i i i wouldn't mind it
uh not really sure
[Music]
i think checking is fine i'm just

[13:46]
i think checking is fine i'm just
letting maruka
continue betting and then maybe check
raising turn i think is a fine strategy
with at least ace 10 and is not just
stacking two pairs maybe if he batted
the hand like king jack that's an open
ender make him fold quite a lot of

[14:00]
ender make him fold quite a lot of
equity combo draws etc and if he had a
better hand we still have some equity
especially if we have ace 10. so for
example bets now i think this is a point
where
we could consider already check raising
now with ace 10.
i think a lot of other our other hands

[14:16]
i think a lot of other our other hands
are just going to check call
let's see would we ever have a bluff
check race
10 jack then jack or something
bit funky i don't know it's going to be

[14:30]
bit funky i don't know it's going to be
a little bit hard i guess to fight to
find
bluffs here but i guess 10 jackets like
the first hand that comes in mind
a holding like that holding like jack 9
suited maybe
not sure we call again okay

[14:46]
not sure we call again okay
interesting river is a 10 pairing the
board
and bringing the flush a lot of
like if if maruka now has still has the
sets
i think he should be checking back like

[15:01]
i think he should be checking back like
some flush draws at some point
um meruko should also have like some
more unnatural type of bluffs like
five four spades or something or like an
underpair
so i think again it's the correct
strategy is to just keep on checking
just like i think on the turn is the

[15:15]
just like i think on the turn is the
best strategy
checks
marouk actually checks back we don't
really know what he has
if i will be streaming we could not
maybe play the chicken song depending on
the showdown and sure we actually showed
up with the aces which i think is a good
check call on the flop

[15:31]
check call on the flop
he decided to check all that on the turn
which i think is also fine the downside
is
that now there's quite a lot of hands
that we can maybe stack like 8 nine
stance and they're gonna be like some
dicey rivers
uh but i do think um especially if you
have a little bit more of an aggressive

[15:46]
have a little bit more of an aggressive
opponent
his bluffs should make up for that um
yeah he checked back in but he could
still have maybe like eight nine suited
um
that he now checked on loss he could
maybe have had like a screen or a jack
that he now checks on law so it's not
necessarily a give up

[16:00]
necessarily a give up
and i like the way chirpy play this hand
basically on all streets
so shout out to chirpy we're still
at 25.50 this time chirpy decides to go
after
poker kluka

[16:15]
not a great idea mr chirpy i know what
you're doing but i hope you have aces
again one of these more connected boards
so interesting chirpy indeed starts off
with a check again
poker clue goes for a bat this is gonna
be a quite common scenario here

[16:30]
be a quite common scenario here
uh again for check raising candidates
check colin can that's kind of where in
the same story i do actually think now
that
ace king with a diamond could probably
peel as on the 8 9 10 remember we had a
jack and a screen which were draws which
here it's not really the case
so i would just prefer to check all of

[16:46]
so i would just prefer to check all of
my ace kings
with a diamond maybe a screen with the
ace of diamonds and then basically
just check folding the rest
chirpy calls okay
turn bring some connectivity goes for a

[17:02]
turn bring some connectivity goes for a
small bed again which actually i
like i think it's a fine strategy if it
goes check check too often
uh let's say for example we use a big
bat if we're in poker glucose shoes
we're gonna reduce
our betting frequency and therefore our

[17:16]
our betting frequency and therefore our
position is just going to realize while
our faculty this this allows us to bet a
little bit more hands so let's say we
have
like 89 suited or something where you
can actually bat that so we have nines
we can actually bet
so i like the sizing used from proper
gluca

[17:30]
gluca
um as well it kind of forces the other
position to keep on calling with maybe
have like a7
suited uh in general it's a it's a it's
a
hard sizing to defend against so i
definitely like it
chirpy stacks along so he probably now

[17:47]
chirpy stacks along so he probably now
has a mate he could definitely have aces
again which i think is very
legit he could have the a screen with
the a's and diamonds
he could still have maybe a straight he
could still have a sex
he could basically both reigns can still
have a bunch of hands

[18:02]
have a bunch of hands
so let's see what the river brings to
river is a four
shouldn't really change something for
chirpy i don't think you have a leading
range here i think
it's way more likely that poker kluka
was bluffing off on the turn with fives
with the diamond for example

[18:15]
with the diamond for example
then that chirpy now suddenly has a five
same with like six five suited
so i think we should not really be doing
a lot of leading and just doing a lot of
checking
and i think poker cluecast should now
kind of really review the strength of
his hand
often using a big bat or check type of

[18:30]
often using a big bat or check type of
strategy
and i think you should just only bat two
pair plus i would say
um and then chirpy is kind of in a bluff
cut scenario with even his strongest
hands like kings and aces
so i think it's a good spot overall

[18:46]
so i think it's a good spot overall
range wise for kluka
but actually kluuka checked down chirpy
showed up with the 89 which i think is
played
perfectly fine
could maybe check rage flop some of the
time

[19:01]
time
i wouldn't i wouldn't actually be
surprised if the solver would find check
raises somewhere with this hand it feels
a little bit like a merging hand and
solvers do like that and poke luka shows
up with the queen jack which i think is
played fine at all streets
um definitely i like definitely like his

[19:17]
um definitely i like definitely like his
term bat
i like his river check so i think both
players again play this hat
perfectly fine 10 20
chirpy tree bets on the bottom versus ep
marioka defense popcorn's 587

[19:33]
marioka defense popcorn's 587
is a very good flop for the out position
as it's way more likely that chirpy will
flat all the pairs on the button
or if he only uses a three bed range
he's probably not three betting five
sixes and sevens
or even eights and maruka can definitely

[19:46]
or even eights and maruka can definitely
raise calls especially being a little
bit deeper
i don't know how big they went pre-flop
so that's 2.25 and this
is for playing 1020. yeah you could
probably build this
some of the time so actually i wouldn't
mind to construct a leading range if i'm

[20:01]
mind to construct a leading range if i'm
moroccan and i expect terpy to check
back quite often
which indeed happens so it's interesting
we keep on playing these connected
boards and so far chirpy
it's definitely recognizing that these
are boards where you should probably
slow down a little bit
this for mariuka bringing a flush i

[20:16]
this for mariuka bringing a flush i
think we
should definitely have some bets
especially if we don't dunk that
so let's see i wouldn't mind using uh
a mix of sizings like some one turrets
and some big bats
here goes for the big bet which i like

[20:32]
here goes for the big bet which i like
um yeah not much else that i can say i
think this is a great
play especially if um
yeah like for example chirpy even if
chirping has had like ace king he's
basically just

[20:45]
basically just
if maruka constructor's range correctly
he's already
basically in a zero ev situation uh he
still has to dodge quite a lot of rivers
depending on your opponent this is
already maybe a spot where
especially with lower stakes versus more
passive opponents you can maybe already

[21:00]
passive opponents you can maybe already
fold the turn but i think here at high
stakes
ace king is definitely still cold
[Music]
rivers are six interesting especially if
maruka bets again
like in these formations morocco
probably doesn't have any offset combos

[21:15]
probably doesn't have any offset combos
so
let's say in a wider wider spot like
blind vs blind we could talk about ace
10 off with the ace of
clubs like a lot of natural hands to be
bluffing with on the turning on the
river
he doesn't really have them here in
these positions so
this block should come more from maybe

[21:32]
this block should come more from maybe
like
pocket sixes on the turn for example or
pocket nines with a club even
um maybe like
yeah pocket fours with the club these
kind of hands like a little bit more
under your end and they kind of all got
there on the river

[21:45]
there on the river
so i would like if i'm a ryuka to bet
again but kind of just reduce my sizing
as it's very
hard for us to have bloss and it's very
hard to get called
down by chirpy bucks if we have a lesser
hand if i would have
a bluff basically i think we can just
bat range on this river

[22:01]
bat range on this river
obviously depending on what we got in
the term but uh
let's say he was out of line with like
jack queen
or like ace queen of hearts or something
if you decide to bet at once because
kind of then you're blocking king queen
ace king aces

[22:16]
ace king aces
and they're probably not gonna fall but
then again it's just such a good referee
i would never
have a checking range probably if i'm
overcondors river
and he doesn't he goes for it three
quarters which actually i think is still
quite a hefty bet
uh given how good the river is for your

[22:32]
uh given how good the river is for your
range
and also i think if we would have
rivered five six suited or pocket sixes
i would still just want to bet so i
would probably prefer to use a smaller
sizing if i'm in his shoes
and chirpy now actually goes all in

[22:45]
and chirpy now actually goes all in
shout out to chirpy
chirpy ain't afraid man he just throws
his whole stack in it's quite
interesting chirpy could
have the offset combination so he could
definitely play ace queen off
for example this way i don't think he's
going to bet this flop
so a blood for chirping would definitely

[23:00]
so a blood for chirping would definitely
be ace clubs
queen axe type of holdings because jack
off is a little bit tight
he should definitely be bluffing maybe
have like aces again ace king with asia
clubs just like a hand we talked earlier
uh and maruka yeah maruka again has

[23:16]
uh and maruka yeah maruka again has
just yeah i mean chirpy is kind of
saying that he has a flush or he has a
bluff which involves
some of these hands that i just
mentioned so it doesn't really matter if
you're morocco if you have a set a
straight to set
a set a straight a flush two pair it

[23:31]
a set a straight a flush two pair it
doesn't really matter
uh they're gonna be frequency calls
and usually in practice that means kind
of reading your opponent correctly and a
frequency hero folding or frequency hero
calling depends on how aggressive or

[23:46]
calling depends on how aggressive or
passive your opponent is
but if you want to play the spot
correctly use the rng
and with a lot of these hands call them
at a certain frequency
if i'm in maruka shoes i'd already know
chirpy
i would just then go for the frequency

[24:00]
i would just then go for the frequency
and
yeah if it's high enough uh
but i wouldn't be too afraid to get over
bluffed here to be honest
[Music]
marook actually does lay down we don't
really know what he has um

[24:15]
really know what he has um
but hey chirpy takes it down another
little pot
pit toys joined the table so sticks
wrecked
battling it out at the 25 50 tables
chirpy boxing and meanwhile
managed to gather a nice little stick
and he opens the button the kaya mock

[24:30]
and he opens the button the kaya mock
three bats the small blind and angry
ogre now actually
called four bats so there's action and
it's up to chirpy box
and chirpy box comes with the click it
back so it's
all crazy action um it's quite an

[24:45]
all crazy action um it's quite an
interesting play they're a little bit
deeper
i would say if you're 100 bb deep this
is not really a thing
um but definitely with this text size
and
these two beings deeper right because we
cannot just jam
because yeah then if gaia mock then

[25:01]
because yeah then if gaia mock then
decides to still have aces
uh let's say for example we have queens
we cannot just jam it in because then
kaya mock just calls with kings and aces
and then that's not a great strategy
whereas if we click and now kai and mox
comes over the top we can
either uh we have to re-evaluate the

[25:15]
either uh we have to re-evaluate the
situation
and we can either see if
kaya mock finds it in him to find some
sort of bluff and then call
or estimate that he just always has
kings and aces and
fold like little girl

[25:31]
fold like little girl
so very interesting spot i think this is
a good sizing to use
angry ogre now is allowed to have some
calls as i mean he only has to call 1k
to win 4k
looking to out draw mr chirpy
[Music]

[25:46]
[Music]
kaya mock at least gets out of the way
this is probably a religion this kind of
spot you're quite released if you see
cayenne tanking you're not very happy
and in the end angry ogre also goes out
of the way
and we win a nice little pop pre-flop

[26:00]
and we win a nice little pop pre-flop
but i thought the stack size situation
here was quite interesting
and actually that's it for the hands of
mr
chirpy if you have any tips or advice
