get to good to p a good show as well you
know I'd like to think I one with some
stule I recall you actually in in our
last conversation actually you talked

[02:31]
last conversation actually you talked
about how you thought the sport element
of Poker was under often kind of
underrated and like the gamble side came
out right and you I think you recalled
like hust Casino was a bit guilty of
that and you liked it actually way more
like the way they cover chests you think

[02:46]
like the way they cover chests you think
you think coin poker in general they did
a good job of trying to make it a more a
bit more like chess where you saw high
level poker and people competing against
each other yeah yeah 100% I think this
was really like this is really a
spectacle for the poker purist

[03:01]
spectacle for the poker purist
um yeah and like yeah I I just think
having having an appreciation of um just
how high level poker can be uh you know
get getting regs
to uh come on stream and like show off a

[03:16]
to uh come on stream and like show off a
bit and show like just how much is going
on like under the her in some of these
hands I think yeah this was like
honestly this is what I would dream of
in a poker event like if um if
everything was like this then yeah I I'd

[03:30]
everything was like this then yeah I I'd
be having yeah this is this is perfect
for me honestly since since it's ended
I've just been like I've been playing
some especially some like heads up
battles but it's kind of been weirdly
low intensity this was like yeah this
was like so much fun for me and just the

[03:46]
was like so much fun for me and just the
yeah the Thriller competition playing
against you know all the best
guys yeah a little a little spoiler
alert for the audience in two weeks from
now when you're watching this we will
actually release a podcast with Arman
absolute top up and he actually said the
same thing it's like after this
challenge you I think all you guys you

[04:01]
challenge you I think all you guys you
kind of fall into this sort of black
hole where it's like the normal grind is
a bit boring you know you you're your
open system is stimulated at such a high
level so I think you guys should just
all meet up again and and just continue
play for the sake of it what do you say

[04:16]
play for the sake of it what do you say
yeah yeah it's like I say that after
having
had um couple weeks break and uh but
then if we got back into it I'm sure
like yeah I'm sure it' just be like okay
okay like we should have we should have
taking a little bit more time off before

[04:31]
taking a little bit more time off before
hitting a grind ntense again um I I I
think for some of the guys who are like
who wen't uh who were finished bit on
middle of the pack maybe they're
probably a bit more rusted I guess
because like they didn't have that you

[04:47]
because like they didn't have that you
know right up until the wire like
playing um but yeah it did leave me
pretty shattered I think I barely played
poker for like a week after the
challenge
ended um yeah just didn't touch it which

[05:01]
ended um yeah just didn't touch it which
is so weird for me like that probably
doesn't sound like a lot to most people
but I usually take like most a day or
two off and then after the challenge I
was just like oh my God I can barely
even look at poker I just need to
collapse and yeah is the itch

[05:15]
collapse and yeah is the itch
back uh yeah kind of but like I'm not
like I found I just wasn't playing that
well uh but also I mean I was playing
heads up so it kind of made sense for me
to be
rusty um

[05:30]
rusty um
I got like I got like kind of killed by
yasam
fore so yeah yeah I mean I was kind of I
was kind of winding him up in the
challenge you know I mean all in good
fun but um yeah and then he was like he

[05:45]
fun but um yeah and then he was like he
was doing a countdown until the
challenge ended he was just like I'm
waiting for you in seven days
[ __ ] I was like okay cool um and
then like yeah and then we played and he
like he murdered me um he had almost a

[06:00]
like he murdered me um he had almost a
thousand big blind stack on one table
and I was like okay okay um yeah but uh
yeah I didn't uh I don't know I mean
he's obviously obviously running well
but also I could feel it myself like the
intensity wasn't really there which is

[06:15]
intensity wasn't really there which is
say which I you know need to need to
find to be competing at at like the
highest
level um but yeah I'm sure I'm sure
it'll come it's just kind of like yeah
it's just like after such a big hide
there's obvously a bit of a

[06:31]
there's obvously a bit of a
rebound um yeah which I'm like yes I'm
not trying I'm not trying to be too hard
on myself in that respect yeah was kind
kind of to be expected like what one
thing Yuri said was that like so so
often after an upswing people will play

[06:47]
often after an upswing people will play
their worst poker cuz you're so used to
everything working that like that you
feel like you don't even need to try for
all the money to gravitate towards you
and I remember he said that to so many
people I've seen come through gorilla

[07:01]
people I've seen come through gorilla
over the years um like B two and I so
I'm pretty aware of the fact that like
yeah this is going to you know if I'm
not feeling super motivated right now
that's like that's just kind of a
natural part of where I'm at in that

[07:15]
natural part of where I'm at in that
cycle and it it'll
come I can definitely relate I remember
having my at some point when I had like
my best month believe I won like 35k or
something this a long time ago I was
playing a 36 510 and I was like w and
guess what

[07:30]
guess what
the next month was my worst ever month
so I I can I can definitely relate uh
you you just sit in a bit more relaxed
it's like you know I got discovered it's
almost like I want to say it's a little
bit cocky but it's it's like what you
said you're a bit less engaged uh uh

[07:46]
said you're a bit less engaged uh uh
then you know if you go
in yeah with with with with not that win
on on on your back um for the Audience
by the way who are new to our channel uh
this is actually the second time we're
chatting with the oh we did a full

[08:00]
chatting with the oh we did a full
podcast covering his complete story
towards I think it was the end of 2023
in that podcast you clearly actually
stated that you wanted to become the
number one poker player which was the
also actually the motivation behind your
screen name I actually listened back to

[08:15]
screen name I actually listened back to
it you said Prodigy uh which was kind of
a promise to yourself uh and kind of an
act of accountability because now there
was no way out right you puted it out
there so now you had to become the best
um that episode was actually titled as

[08:30]
um that episode was actually titled as
well the next best poker player question
mark uh fast forward one of years now
can we remove the question
mark um yeah I remember being like
tensive about that I was just like oh is
this too cocky or I think you were just

[08:45]
this too cocky or I think you were just
like no no no it's it's it's fine you
know like we're just putting the
question out there maybe you will be
maybe you won't I was like okay okay
let's go it um but yeah I mean obviously
now feeling like a lot better about that
I think um I think I think the next best

[09:00]
I think um I think I think the next best
poker player definitively might be a bit
a bit much like I still think um you
know it obviously
like like I I feel like I've played
amazingly throughout the challenge um
but like there was there there's

[09:15]
but like there was there there's
obviously elements have run good um over
like a 40K hand
sample um so I think if I were to just
like I mean the graph looks the graph
looks very pretty but if I were to just
stick that up on the wall and say yeah I
am the best no doubts that would

[09:31]
am the best no doubts that would
probably be jumping the gun there's some
battles to be had with like lonus and
Davey first before I can uh before I can
lay that one down so how representative
do you think this Championship is for
measuring who is currently the best so

[09:45]
measuring who is currently the best so
that would mean that you're the goat and
on the opposite of the spectrum we have
C Lama who's then officially the worst
yeah yeah yeah yeah the the faed
sandwich where we would go top and
bottom of the
leaderboard um
yeah I

[10:00]
yeah I
mean I I think yeah it's definitely
like like it's definitely correlating
quite strongly but I think um I mean I
think as well like LL was taking things
like like he was a bit cocky about it

[10:15]
like like he was a bit cocky about it
I'd say this is you know I was I was
obviously living with him during the
time and like going over hands with him
and I feel like because he'd been
playing so many freehanded battles with
Davey and lonus and like also yeah yasam
with be there and Barack as well and

[10:31]
with be there and Barack as well and
he'd been playing those lineups for so
long and he's just like oh well this is
actually a step down from those games he
just expected chips to come to him if
you know what I mean whereas I was more
like I had like that intensity right
from the start I feel like he gave like

[10:45]
from the start I feel like he gave like
100k Head Start and then was suddenly
like oh no I need to stop playing and
then he ran a bit bad and was like okay
well all right I'll go you know he's
like in Vegas there's plenty of big live
games and like much bigger than 5100 so
yeah I I

[11:00]
yeah I I
think I I would I wouldn't say that like
my yeah I wouldn't say it's definitive
but I think I think the way I played in
The Challenge I would say that I played
the best over those 40K hands actually

[11:15]
the best over those 40K hands actually
because I played with like such
intensity the whole time and I think I
was like I think to some people they
weren't taking it yeah they they it
wasn't as serious to them you know I
would say like lonus at one point he was
like I think he dropped out when he was

[11:32]
like I think he dropped out when he was
roughly like 15 bons off the pace which
is obviously like a pretty decent lead
that um I had at that point but it's
also like you know you look at how Kevin
was taking the challenge if Kevin was 15
bins off the pace he would just be like

[11:45]
bins off the pace he would just be like
okay that means I need to play 16 hours
tomorrow um and that's what he was
trying to do so you could see there was
like a little like you know and also
Davey had um Davey had scheduled some
time off at the start of the challenge
so he' missed that um so I think like

[12:03]
so he' missed that um so I think like
there were a few you know a few of the
guys who I would say you know if I was
trying to rank myself one I would say
I'd need to definitively say I'm better
than like you know llama daav lonus I
think those are like the three names

[12:15]
think those are like the three names
that I would have to and I think in all
of those cases it's a bit like it's a
bit blurry around the edges but I think
everyone else I'm comfortable saying
that there's like a pretty decent Gap I
mean like maybe we'd stick like Kevin on
the
edges um but yeah I would say like I'd

[12:33]
edges um but yeah I would say like I'd
say that that top five at least in my
mind is quite separated from everyone
else uh yeah and then then there's like
yeah a bit Yeah bit of a like there
there's a tiar blow of like people who

[12:45]
there's a tiar blow of like people who
are still like very good players but I
yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't be
uncomfortable saying that we're like you
know this group is is clearly
stronger of like from the outside
looking in
uh and also in my experience like I

[13:01]
uh and also in my experience like I
haven't battled any high stakes in the
recent years but before that I was very
active doing that as well and from the
outside looking in and people would
always say why do you battle edges are
small everyone is uh basically GTO right
I remember also in the last in the last

[13:15]
I remember also in the last in the last
podcast you you you pointed out that you
know we have to always remember the fact
that people are human even like I
commentated on quite a lot of matches
also with your reaction there were a
couple things where we sometimes put a
people a bit too much on the PED store
and we had to kind of say listen these
guys are humans you know they will also

[13:30]
guys are humans you know they will also
be sensitive to making mistakes and you
know certain certain areas are just
easier to screw up than others but like
commonly all every time when I watched
the the streams and the commentating
everyone would say the win rates are so
close but like an honest an honest

[13:46]
close but like an honest an honest
opinion like from my experience people
were saying that back in the days and I
was like no no no no no no there's a
couple guys winning all the money and a
couple guys losing a lot of money right
how how how close do you feel like it is
you already kind of pointed out like
sort of top five what are we talking

[14:01]
sort of top five what are we talking
about in Win race like I think you ended
up with 10bb 100 you think this is a
representative 14 don't
even um well I think I

[14:15]
even um well I think I
mean you can just look at Davy's graph
realistically and Davy's had like I
think seven to n BB R battling for years
and like obviously there are some fish
in there you know it's not like it's not
the championship where it's essentially

[14:30]
the championship where it's essentially
just like all Rags but um you know like
Dave's been winning at that kind of rate
in the toughest games like the guy
doesn't game select like uh I mean he
was recently on the podcast and um

[14:45]
was recently on the podcast and um
someone I was very happy that they
translated a bunch of it for me um and
and one of the things he said was he
just prioritized is showing up and just
playing his best and then whatever the
game is the game is uh and like you can
definitely yeah you can see that in the
games he ends up in and he like yeah

[15:02]
games he ends up in and he like yeah
he's been crushing at like an insane win
rate for so
long
um like yeah obviously some of the like
he does play down to 5K and sometimes
down to 2K so some of the games might be
easier than the
challenge um but yeah I I think when

[15:17]
challenge um but yeah I I think when
people say that you can only ever really
hit a 2bb win R in a red battle that's
them sort of telling on themselves
because it's it's them saying that they
don't understand how deep poker goes um
that you could you know that if you

[15:31]
that you could you know that if you
think about what a 2bb win rate is
that's like so imagine you guys are just
chopping GTO and then there's one 20 big
blind pot every thousand hands where you
make a super high confidence decision in
what is supposed to be a zero EV spot

[15:46]
what is supposed to be a zero EV spot
it's like every thousand hands you find
120 and then you actually think about
what realistically happens and it's like
you you have like these 200 big blind
pots which are going in all all the time
because everyone's super aggressive and

[16:01]
because everyone's super aggressive and
sure there'll be a bunch of them where
you just have to play kind of standardly
and the guy doesn't give anything away
but if you just find you know you don't
need to find one of those often to add
5bb to your win rate um which is what I
think people don't appreciate because

[16:15]
think people don't appreciate because
like they're so used to you know they
they're so used to this idea of like I
will just play good poker and the other
person will like fall apart it's like
okay maybe we need to you know maybe we
need to set some challenges for them and
see where they trip up and be willing to
go out on a

[16:30]
go out on a
limb and then and then obviously like
edges get even higher when people are
playing like that because if you're
willing to get really out of line then
it also mean like the counter exploit is
always even bigger than the exploit like
if you're going to range call someone
for a stack then you know it gets it

[16:48]
for a stack then you know it gets it
gets really brutal for you if the person
like one under Bluffs and then two
starts going like even thinner um and
then and then suddenly like your range
cor is like losing tons of money and
then you think about yeah you get a
bunch of players in who are prepared to

[17:01]
bunch of players in who are prepared to
make those decisions all the time and
like obviously not all of them are going
to go your way but but it adds up and
like the edges can get quite big like
someone wants to play a really defensive
play style um there's some guys in there
in there like that who um I was just

[17:15]
in there like that who um I was just
like well the maximum the maximum amount
of edge you can push against these guys
is just going to be like not that big
but they're also not causing anyone any
problems and I think most people came in
with the

[17:30]
with the
they came in with the attitude that they
were going to like go out there and get
their EV um and like they're aware that
makes them vulnerable to counter punches
but that's why you know that's why the
like edges can actually get somewhere
you know no one's no one comes into a r

[17:45]
you know no one's no one comes into a r
battle just like okay my goal here is to
lose slowly like you know um so so yeah
yeah that that there is I think there's
there's plenty of room yeah and then
everyone kind of everyone kind of says
it's like it's like a a 2bb cap but like

[18:00]
it's like it's like a a 2bb cap but like
even if we say like Davey's an outline
and has runw his whole career or like
Dave is just Davey and like no one can
aim to be that it's like clearly more
than that um yeah like I I I I don't
know exactly where to draw the line but
I think I think saying saying that

[18:15]
I think I think saying saying that
someone can beat a r battle for 5bb
would not be controversial to me at all
I think it's very important to put to
have like your perspective because I I
definitely shared his opinion uh um but
there's people on 500L that that are

[18:31]
there's people on 500L that that are
saying that you cannot win in W battles
so you that why oh my God the solo tweet
man the Sal the Salo tweet where he's
just like we put a 500 inl rig in these
20kl battles and they would lose it like
3bb Max and

[18:46]
3bb Max and
then we were just like wow where is this
500 in hourig that we can spot 3bb to
come pun to us like please like I'm s
I'm sorry to 500 you're probably in like
the top 0 point something per of poker
players everywhere but there's just such

[19:00]
players everywhere but there's just such
a you know they're just it's just a
massive difference like we took all the
10K rigs in in the world and there's
still like you know there's still like
edges between people like some people
you could just tell that they were
getting hunted by other RS as well like

[19:16]
getting hunted by other RS as well like
you could see that that Dynamic happens
like at the start everyone's just
thinking like oh it's a r battle I just
take any tables but you could see as it
was going on there were certain people
who were only playing when someone else
was there and it's like yeah like it's
not some people yeah you know when RS

[19:30]
not some people yeah you know when RS
start looking at other RS like their
fish and yeah that's kind of that's like
that Hunter's
mentality but that is the thing right
when when people say you have poor games
like I remember throughout my career I
did a a lot of battling and I was often
called out for bad game selection but I

[19:45]
called out for bad game selection but I
actually thought I had very good game
selection in terms of I was I was
hammering I I was very selective with
with which racks and in which positions
and in which time of the day even I
would sit against someone right there
was a whole strategy around that uh in

[20:00]
was a whole strategy around that uh in
terms for you like game selection wise
did you have like for example you you
pointed out goats lonus uh Davey I would
say two most established names right and
they had llama in there J and
Barrack were you I mean I I remember I

[20:16]
Barrack were you I mean I I remember I
think you were in the US correct was it
maybe also a conscious decision in terms
of time zone
wise
um well yeah I mean I was mostly just
playing when I felt Sharp
to um yeah which was just the priority

[20:31]
to um yeah which was just the priority
to me like I felt like when I was
playing sharp I was playing so well that
that you know that it was just it didn't
matter the table lineup was how I felt
um it's like sure the win rate on some
tables will be lower than others but

[20:46]
tables will be lower than others but
it's not like the highest win rate
challenge it's a most dollars challenge
so I was like okay if I if I'm feeling
good I'll just like get up and play
whatever is that
um so yeah I I wasn't really really like
thinking too much about that I mean it

[21:01]
thinking too much about that I mean it
it kind of came in more at the end of
sessions like if I've been playing for
like six hours and the tables weren't
that good then I was more likely to just
call it a day um but yeah if we're

[21:15]
call it a day um but yeah if we're
playing like you know if if the tables
are kind of softer like lonus has gone
to bed Kevin is somehow not at the
tables by some miracle and in there and
the and mean yeah like the it's just

[21:30]
the and mean yeah like the it's just
doesn't it doesn't have those guys who
are like fighting quite so hard then you
know maybe I play an extra hour or two
but I wasn't really thinking about game
selection beyond that in fact um we had
like like someone was looking for some
side bets not someone who's playing the
challenge but they had some people they

[21:46]
challenge but they had some people they
wanted to bet
on and um we were talking about how to
do it and one of the things they wanted
to do was they wanted to do win rate
props um but I was like okay I don't
want do a win rate prop because that

[22:00]
want do a win rate prop because that
will mean you kind of have to game
select a bit you know like um if I yeah
if if I'm doing my win rate against
another Rag and that other rag has
like like 5 BB win rate it means if I

[22:15]
like like 5 BB win rate it means if I
play a 2bb table I'm bleeding money on
the prop bat and I was like I don't want
to have to do that I just want to
sharpen play um so yeah we tried working
out some things but like nothing really
came of it in the end um but uh yeah
just because yeah wasn't wasn't

[22:31]
just because yeah wasn't wasn't
something I wanted I I didn't want to
have that like extra layer of thinking
about it it was already stressful enough
just in the final few days working at
like okay how much volume do I have to
play like me and rig literally within
$500 of each other at one point with

[22:45]
$500 of each other at one point with
like five days to go I was like oh what
you know what's the plan here all these
weird like ICM considerations which
aren't supposed to be a thing when you
play cash um I was like yeah I don't I I
was glad I didn't have any
um other stuff to think about although

[23:00]
um other stuff to think about although
that being said I could have taken a win
prop as anyone and it would have been
quite nice so yeah I was got to say
lucky
yeah yeah good good in good in foresight
in hindsight I wish I just yellowed it
is it speaking about game selection did

[23:15]
is it speaking about game selection did
you notice that especially towards the
end of the challenge when you were
clearly you know there were were a
couple guys that were uh clearly
dominating the field and whether that
was like a uh a true Rim rate or just
the fact that they were you know they

[23:30]
the fact that they were you know they
were on a high they were playing well
did you notice that some guys started to
give you less action was it hard to get
action yeah it was a it was a bit harder
to get action towards the
end um like not not impossible by any
means but I think well it's it's hard to

[23:47]
means but I think well it's it's hard to
say whether it was like a me
specifically thing or it was just like
it was just the challenge Was Out Of
Reach For A lot of people at that point
when when me and rigged have like other
than Kevin everyone was saying like 30

[24:00]
than Kevin everyone was saying like 30
binds behind and you can see why people
are like okay you know we we'll play a
little bit but they're not trying to
grind like super heavy volume at that
point um and yeah yeah it it just kind
of makes sense you can't really hold
that against people um so yeah I think I

[24:16]
that against people um so yeah I think I
think it was probably a little bit of
both
um but yeah there was still there was
still like plenty of games I'd say I
mean Kevin was uh Kevin was still the
right the wire um and Barack had set

[24:32]
right the wire um and Barack had set
himself a mission to dig himself out of
the hole he was in uh yeah that was yeah
there was there was still GS going down
to the wire yeah and I saw enlight and
ignas [ __ ] also hopping in oh yeah zaz

[24:47]
ignas [ __ ] also hopping in oh yeah zaz
zaz couldn't play the first month um but
then yeah yeah he came back and yeah it
was kind of fun like Z zaz was a lot of
fun at the tables as well like uh he
like free bet you with a free suited on
the show table and then go SBA when it

[25:01]
the show table and then go SBA when it
gets like
yeah uh yeah I def I definitely saw some
uh some entertainment I remember
actually hand where I don't know exactly
what happened but I think it think it
was a fake misclick uh where I think

[25:15]
was a fake misclick uh where I think
Kevin limped the small blind and then he
made it 3K instead of instead of three
big blinds or something like that and
then Kevin jammed six and he had Ace
King and then Kevin said haha nice trick
so there were a bunch of stuff going on
like that which was actually quite funny
we we actually are already quite deep

[25:30]
we we actually are already quite deep
into the championship but I actually
wanted to start the conversation of uh
quickly kind of Bridging the Gap between
when we last spoke and now uh uh that's
been like what what have you been up to
in like the last since the last time we
spoke so that's like 12 to 15 months

[25:45]
spoke so that's like 12 to 15 months
leading up to the challenge any
noticeable improvements or changes
you've made in your approach to playing
poker compared to when we last spoke in
20123 um yeah I mean think a lot a lot
of things like technically been refined
since

[26:00]
since
then um yeah I think as well
like I sort of well quite recently at
least I got to a level of fluency where
I sort of I swore of solvers for a bit
um just because I felt like I felt like

[26:17]
um just because I felt like I felt like
they were getting in like they were
getting in my way of making the play
which is making the most money just
because I was like I was almost too
aware of just like oh okay in this spot
we're supposed to like this is how it's

[26:31]
we're supposed to like this is how it's
supposed to play and I was like going
through the motions of that too much
rather than actually actually thinking
about you know what like what this line
means when a human does it rather than
what it means when a solver does it

[26:46]
what it means when a solver does it
um yeah I mean I I've just been feeling
so like so much more confident recently
I've been playing a lot of heads up as
well in that time um which was so which
I think really helped me with with going
into the challenge CU a lot of heads up

[27:01]
into the challenge CU a lot of heads up
mindset is about like killing the exact
guy across from you and like you're not
you know you're not just playing your
game uh and just hoping that like hoping
they not reacting to it and hoping that

[27:16]
they not reacting to it and hoping that
you know everything you're doing at the
start will work like 5,000 hands later
you're constantly trying to be sharp and
thinking about um you know thinking
about exactly exactly what they're
showing you they know about your game

[27:30]
showing you they know about your game
and also what they're giving away about
theirs uh and yeah I had like a lot of
experience with that um over the past
year or so because I've been yeah just
obsessed with heads up whenever I could
get action I would play um and um yeah I

[27:47]
get action I would play um and um yeah I
and then I went into the challenge kind
of kind of thinking about it like that
um where I was like I was like trying to
think of it more as like like 21 v1s I
mean I there's like 45 Old players like
a lot of people who dropped out and I

[28:00]
a lot of people who dropped out and I
yeah and I sort of had this different
approach where I wasn't like I was
trying to play like a very tailored game
plan to
everyone um like I remember talking to
ricked about the challenge afterwards
and I was just like I really hope that
there are people having very strong

[28:15]
there are people having very strong
disagreements about what my Tendencies
and leaks are after The Challenge
because I I assume like my game's
getting discusted you know at least
somewhat I was like I I I really hope
there are guys who just been like oh
there a massive [ __ ] station and then
someone else is just like what do you
mean like this guy never calls rivers

[28:30]
mean like this guy never calls rivers
and I was like yeah I I hope that yeah I
hope that there's like a bit of a you
know maybe a bit more Nuance than that
to it but um but yeah I really would I
really wanted to play like yeah to play
again uh against the individuals um cuz

[28:45]
again uh against the individuals um cuz
I think that was what that was what
suited me uh and it's like quite a small
pool especially like a lot of the action
was like three or
four-handed um and you're playing
against the same Guys across every table
so having you know just like up my notes
refreshing it before before like sitting

[29:01]
refreshing it before before like sitting
down and just being like okay this is
how I think I'm generating Edge against
this guy you know compared to compared
to against this guy like um and also
like the opposite these are the spots
where the guy is playing very well like
don't don't don't worry too much this

[29:16]
don't don't don't worry too much this
guy's just yeah this guy's just got a
very accurate good triple barrel like
you're just going to how you know just
cool down properly like don't don't
waste too much mental energy or stuff
like that um yeah and I I think I think
that was an element that probably the

[29:30]
that was an element that probably the
six Max guys weren't as ready for um
because yeah they probably they probably
hadn't done something like like you
don't really hear about freehanded
challenges right like sometimes you get
it with like the lonus DAV Lama Yas you
know these guys they're playing in their

[29:46]
know these guys they're playing in their
sort of own pool but I think for a lot
of the guys they used to they're used to
Fading Into the background a bit and for
everyone else being like just another
rag at the table who who you know kind
of whether they're like a red liner or
blue liner or whatever but you don't

[30:00]
blue liner or whatever but you don't
have this like very specific read on how
they're going to try and take your Chips
and like how they're going to leave
there as exposed um but yeah yeah I
think just getting more like iting like
way more into that mindset um yeah just

[30:16]
way more into that mindset um yeah just
like not trying to you know not not
trying to have like a default box of
tricks or anything where I'm too ring on
like certain ways to get get things but
more trying to be like a chameleon um
which is what one of the things which I

[30:30]
which is what one of the things which I
think sets sets the top guys apart um
like it's not universally true but I
think like above a certain level so the
way that a lot of guys have got there is
being prepared to win like whatever that
way

[30:45]
way
is um like you know just on the simple
level they can blue line or they can red
line depending on like who their
opponent and what they're giving but
yeah like lots of other things like not
being too married to One play style um

[31:00]
being too married to One play style um
and then I think like yeah one of the
things which marks people out as a tier
below that to me is they have a trick
that they like running and like it might
be a really good trick but they're not
critical about whether this is the right
guy to run it on so it might be good
against 80% of the field but then

[31:16]
against 80% of the field but then
there's a 20% where this is like kind of
this is just burning money uh and so
like on average it's making them EV
having this like you know having this
thing they like to do whatever is
whether it's some macro game plan or
some like weird Tech but if you're not

[31:32]
some like weird Tech but if you're not
if you're not critical about who this is
good against then it's kind of just like
it it it's like it's gaining U but it's
like boardline leak you know because if
if someone works it out then suddenly

[31:45]
if someone works it out then suddenly
this starts bleeding so much uh which I
I guess comes back to what I was saying
about like Edge and R
bowels um yeah and that there's guy
there's guys who are like yeah I mean
especially with the show as well you
could tell you could tell who the guys

[32:00]
could tell you could tell who the guys
were who were paying a lot of attention
and like the mea was evolving really
fast against them do you maybe have like
an example of uh how how players would
use show tables I remember actually in
our last conversation uh uh you
mentioned something about streaming and

[32:16]
mentioned something about streaming and
showing your hold C I cannot do that
because you know these top guys they do
a lot with the information and then
suddenly we have show tables where they
get all the information so I'm very
curious how how how that element uh
played into your decision making and

[32:30]
played into your decision making and
also in terms of you mentioned that you
saw player some players use that
information properly and others maybe
sort of ignoring it yeah I mean I think
the guy who honestly the guy who used it
the best was
munz like I I swear so many Bluffs which

[32:47]
munz like I I swear so many Bluffs which
I used to be so sure would get through
against munz stopped getting through
against him
he like I mean I'm not I wouldn't say he
was necessarily range calling me but
like yeah there were a lot of spots

[33:01]
like yeah there were a lot of spots
where I was just so used to muna's tank
folding to me and yeah I think he like
yeah he he realized that he couldn't get
away with that um and then uh yeah he
was making some catches and spots that
he definitely wasn't before the

[33:15]
he definitely wasn't before the
challenge and I was like oh okay like
yeah like mun's default is to play on
the tighter side but yeah it's it's what
I'm saying like being able to play
against type and be a bit of a like even
if even if what he wants to do is to try

[33:31]
if even if what he wants to do is to try
and get away from spots and like that's
how he's going to generate Edge by not
paying people off it yeah he sort of he
realized quite early on in the challenge
where he was like okay I'm going to have
to like I can't let this guy run me over
cuz I was just like ripping Forex pot

[33:45]
cuz I was just like ripping Forex pot
into him like every
opportunity he got like you know a few
days in and then I I feel like I mean I
havn't checked this but if I had to see
like my dollars in dollars out I would
imagine Muno was actually up quite a bit

[34:00]
imagine Muno was actually up quite a bit
despite me up swinging super hard
because it you know I thought that I
thought I was just like oh like he you
know he made his hero call and then
he'll go back to being tight and I kept
trying to bully him and he just kept
calling I was like oh what the [ __ ] is

[34:15]
calling I was like oh what the [ __ ] is
this why is mun stationing me um yeah um
yeah and then we could you know
obviously we get a bit back towards like
more of an equilibrium after a while um
yeah when I was just like okay like but

[34:31]
yeah when I was just like okay like but
yeah he still he still owned me like
right at the end of The Challenge there
was a spot where I like just tried to
bully him super hard and then he just
like yeah he just flicks in the call
with probably what was entire range
um um so so yeah he he's he was

[34:45]
um um so so yeah he he's he was
definitely one that stood out to me as
using that
um but yeah I I I don't think everyone
was I don't think everyone realized like
you know there is there's a lot of info
to be had here and I think like some
people were being very Casal about it um

[35:01]
people were being very Casal about it um
I guess it's also kind of shows more
their mentality right where they're more
a bit more focused on maybe uh just
trying to win with playing an overall
better game plan and keeping the
adjustments to a minimum something that
I actually personally experien and
really liked about your approach as well

[35:16]
really liked about your approach as well
I had a very similar approach every
battle that I would go in I would have
like five ways that you know e would
come to me and I feel like especially in
a chance like this and especially if if
results maybe are not really going your
way but you can see that the plan that

[35:30]
way but you can see that the plan that
you set out right you indentified let's
say you indentified five weaknesses and
you see in game that indeed your your
these weaknesses are working then
regardless of the results you can see
okay this EV is Flowing to me and then
you gave a good example of you had a
plan vers me has Jam four times spot and
expect him to fold 95% of the time and

[35:45]
expect him to fold 95% of the time and
suddenly he's
calling my plan here needs some
adjusting right but in a lot of areas
I'm sure you felt pretty confident that
you know with the preparation you did
going in and actually seeing like like
oh this was my plan and it's working
because they're doing the things that I

[36:00]
because they're doing the things that I
predicted they would do and my plan is
working for them does that give you like
a lot of a lot of confidence regardless
or of if the results go your way or not
maybe not not only in the challeng but
maybe also in these heads up battles
that you've been playing over the last
year uh yeah yeah I definitely I'd say

[36:17]
year uh yeah yeah I definitely I'd say
um yeah it's it's really good to have
some things to fall back on uh and just
just know that like yeah even um because
at times so so like I I really like to

[36:30]
at times so so like I I really like to
listen to my instincts and um if I just
have a feeling about a spot I I like to
just go with it which is yeah actually
something which I've got much better at
since um his like meeting and working
with llama because he's like you know
he's a very instinctual player and I was

[36:46]
he's a very instinctual player and I was
watching you know watching him play and
um a lot of you know a lot of what he
does is just uh you know he kind of
knows what's reasonable and then he'll
just get a feeling to like you know go
after something um and so like I try I

[37:01]
after something um and so like I try I
try to do that but it but sometimes like
your instincts are kind of misfiring and
you have a session where like your
conference is a bit low for whatever
reason and it's nice to be able to fall
back on um to fall back on a game plan
and know that like okay you know if I

[37:18]
and know that like okay you know if I
just sit there and play my Fury
defensive game then there's not like you
know I'm not bleeding too much and then
I have like these specific areas where I
think I'm going to I'm going to be
pushing enough Edge that it's fine and

[37:32]
pushing enough Edge that it's fine and
then if I want to go for Stuff other
than that I can but there's no pressure
too
um which is which is like a real like
that that's the ideal place for me to be
where like all of the more extreme

[37:45]
where like all of the more extreme
exploits are very you know very optional
because I have this other game plan
which I have confidence in um and then
you can you know you can take the Big
Win Win rate swings when you're like
when you're feeling much more yeah when
you're feeling better about them like
there there are some calls where it's

[38:01]
there there are some calls where it's
like all like Bluffs or whatever which
I'm only going to make if like like
they're out of line enough that I'm only
making them when I'm like high
confidence you know um and then like
there's you know that there's like the

[38:15]
there's you know that there's like the
lower level adjustments where you know
you've confirmed them you spent your
time time off table like you're you're
mostly only taking them with reasonable
hands which it's like like I you know I
need to be feeling particularly like

[38:30]
need to be feeling particularly like
good on that any given day to to run
that stuff and I think that that is like
the basis of the win rate I think the
the highlight real plays like are the
ones you know the ones where people end
up on two plus two or there's a YouTube
video or whatever I like the like
they're like the cherry on top of your

[38:45]
they're like the cherry on top of your
win rate but like there's a lot of like
Baseline win rate in just playing like
playing well and like hitting the same
key notes uh with
consistency yeah every time maneuvering
your hands in the notes where you know
your opponent's going to screw up
without him knowing it right so they're

[39:01]
without him knowing it right so they're
that kind of bleeding and then I guess
that also made it easier for you because
like a lot of the guys they indeed
hopped on like the coin poker YouTube
channel and you know they were there
reviewing hands talking about strategy
at a very high level I think this was a
great time uh for people who were

[39:15]
great time uh for people who were
interested in cash games because they
could hear kind of the best of best
discussing but what you're saying is
yeah they usually discuss like this big
pot and it's quite easy to be open in
that because like my real money was made
in like different areas right my game
plan was tailored in a way and that's
not something that I'm sharing obviously

[39:31]
not something that I'm sharing obviously
uh in these conversations I remember
actually also in our previous
conversation you just came back from
your heads up battle against Doc pulk
and in there you also mentioned that you
had a spreadsheet on your laptop
tracking every single mistake you
expected him to make this this this
process seemed very similar maybe you

[39:46]
process seemed very similar maybe you
could give an Insight in how a
preparation or what type of tendencies
that you look for in opponents uh
without obviously going in specifics uh
you don't have to share obviously
specific read what are kind of
tendencies that people can look for in

[40:00]
tendencies that people can look for in
opponents uh to form or to like gather
like five of these let say weaknesses
that they can take advantage
of yeah I mean I think I've got like way
I've actually got a lot less systematic
about it now I think my notes used to be

[40:19]
about it now I think my notes used to be
like my notes used to be very much like
like i' have like a spreadsheet of
someone's frequency by node or something
I mean obviously like versus Doug I had
to infer it from showdowns but I used to

[40:31]
to infer it from showdowns but I used to
do all of that stuff and then I sort of
realized more so that like I I much
prefer just getting like a feel for
certain like puzzle pieces um just being
like okay well this guy you know in this

[40:48]
like okay well this guy you know in this
specific line when this
happened um I kind of felt like I was
being [ __ ] with but you know I'm
generally a suspicious guy so I was like
okay I don't have the hand I'll fold but

[41:00]
okay I don't have the hand I'll fold but
um just like making a note that it was
like it's like okay yeah I felt like he
was up to something here and also trying
to trying to make a hand like less
specific and more down to a bunch of
Vibes like so say you know you could say

[41:17]
Vibes like so say you know you could say
like if say saying like Okay I was I was
capped here and the guy like check
raised me huge
on the river
and like I felt like he might have been

[41:31]
and like I felt like he might have been
going after me but also it just is kind
of the size and then like I just like
note that down and then you know the
next time I get to session i' just be
like just like read over a few like you
know there'll be like the core notes
which I know to be true and then like a
few things where us just like okay this

[41:45]
few things where us just like okay this
is what you know this is what I thought
might have some basis to it and then
like get into another session it's like
okay you're right he's gone for that
spot like you know a few more times so
we're GNA have to um we're gonna have to
like either get a bit sticky to it or

[42:01]
like either get a bit sticky to it or
like you know prepare for it in some
other way um so yeah and just knowing
like like how does someone like to come
after you um like yeah some guys I would
just be like
oh you'd be you'd be sitting there like

[42:17]
oh you'd be you'd be sitting there like
scared to bet draw anywhere because they
do so much
raising um yeah and and then and it's
like okay like are they you know I'm am
I getting
raised like am am I just do I just feel

[42:31]
raised like am am I just do I just feel
like I'm getting run over because it's
like one session and sometimes someone
hits that or like you know am am I
getting the same feeling over multiple
sessions to the point where I have
confidence in it um and and also yeah
that the problem with using stats in
like a Sixx scenario is that I want to

[42:48]
like a Sixx scenario is that I want to
know how they're playing against
me right if I you know even even now if
I look at mun as's stats it will say
that he's just like he's significantly
overfolded to River Bats right sorry

[43:00]
overfolded to River Bats right sorry
Meers your leaks are out um but um but
like you know if I think about what he
was doing against me
specifically uh yeah I I I was like okay
well I think that one's kind of out the
window um you know that that's one which

[43:16]
window um you know that that's one which
I can't I can't be I can't be reliant on
um so yeah I I think it's just like a
lot a lot of me like noting down like
random feelings I had and then seeing
like the next session I come back to do
I get that same impression or was it

[43:31]
I get that same impression or was it
just you know because it's so easy to
feel like someone's either running you
over or someone's like a complete
punching bag on like a one session basis
um and then if you actually think about
what you're doing it's that you're
taking a thousand hand sample and trying
to extrapolate way too much from it um

[43:46]
to extrapolate way too much from it um
but you know if that happens like a few
sessions in a row it's like okay yeah
like this guy's really going to war with
me here and like we need to be ready for
it like it
yeah in terms of going in and looking at
uh at your own game and your own kind of

[44:01]
uh at your own game and your own kind of
strengths and weaknesses what we're like
because obviously you focus a lot on
your
opponents I I mean I would I would
estimate that all of the guys you know
they did something similar to you
leading up to the Chan they like oh this
own guy is going to compete okay well
take let's take a look at how he you

[44:16]
take let's take a look at how he you
know on average approach pooker were
there like certain because that's then
another element of of Warfare let's put
it this way that you can look at okay
these are my weaknesses or these are
potential holes that people thing that I
have in my game what are like signs that
they're going after me you you done some

[44:32]
they're going after me you you done some
work on that as well kind of reflecting
on your own game okay where where can I
expect guys to come after me and be
prepared for yeah yeah no I I definitely
like I know I know the places where it's
like okay the these are the places where
I would go after

[44:46]
I would go after
myself and then yeah just being yeah
being aware of what it all look like if
someone has noticed that um because like
it's kind of fine to have a it's kind of
fine to have like I don't know some like

[45:01]
fine to have like I don't know some like
macro leak or something as part of your
game especially if it's you know if if
you want to if you want to adjust in
some way like if you want to be stronger
in one area then you're going to be
weaker in another like you still get
dealt the same hands right um so like if

[45:16]
dealt the same hands right um so like if
you if you have those things going on um
like it's not it it's not the end of the
world but um yeah it comes back to what
I was saying like about how yeah if if
if the things you're doing are good

[45:30]
if the things you're doing are good
against 80% of poor and they're not good
against 20 you need to find the 20 it's
not good against un flip flip the script
on them kind what mun did on you yeah
yeah yeah I mean yeah mun mun knows that
people you know people are going to try

[45:46]
people you know people are going to try
to run him over and then he was like
yeah he's like yeah he know he know he
he was able to just like flip it around
and um make me look silly a few
times yeah it's really funny like
especially over the last few years you

[46:00]
especially over the last few years you
know analyzing people's stats and data
and basically just drawing a conclusion
of oh these are your stat is your game
you're bad or good uh uh and there's
definitely outliers on there out there
especially in the high stakes where if
you just look at at that their game just

[46:15]
you just look at at that their game just
roughly just the numbers you would say
huh I would have expected you know this
guy with this success to you know to
look a little bit more GTO or a little
bit more fierce in their overall game
plan but then actually also sign it like
they're probably they're probably doing
something very well yeah yeah I mean

[46:31]
something very well yeah yeah I mean
this is the classic Barack thing I've
heard I've heard this so many times not
only red well yeah yeah they just they
just like Bara not only his stats are so
Miles off of what they should be and the
guy's the biggest online winner of the
past few years and it's like what the

[46:46]
past few years and it's like what the
[ __ ] is going on there what's a secret
yeah I think he would be uh I think he'd
be very uh very frustrated if I uh if I
gave away of his secret Source I'm fine
to give away mine but no Barack

[47:00]
to give away mine but no Barack
definitely has some stuff going on I've
learned a lot from Barack um but yeah
yeah he's
gonna he's gonna get you and it's not
because he's going to be more accurate
there more than Ms the ey yeah yeah of
course I mean I think it yeah like I

[47:16]
course I mean I think it yeah like I
feel like Barack is probably the high St
R who gets most accused of being a
sunrunner because his stats are like the
most visibly out of line um but then
yeah no that
that I as much as I can give away is

[47:30]
that I as much as I can give away is
that there's more going on than people
people initially
realize I mean in it's similar it's
similar obviously it's not as extreme
but similar with for example munus and
actually it's funny to point out I
actually been guilty of that I think it
was like two years ago I was like hm
this there's something wrong but I

[47:46]
this there's something wrong but I
realized like probably I'm missing
something here right that's kind of the
that's kind of the humbleness that that
that that that that you need I think in
this kind of scenarios uh what you you
mentioned about you know being aware of
your weaknesses how do you not become
paranoid especially with show tables of

[48:01]
paranoid especially with show tables of
like oh they're they're going after me
you know and remember actually in the
last conversation you pointed out that
was actually a leak of you when you
played against stuer opponents like oh
you you you know you felt like you have
to kind of over adjust or or show of
becoming maybe a little bit too fancy

[48:15]
becoming maybe a little bit too fancy
how do you not uh become paranoid
especially with like the show element
and with the level of I I think I I
decided really early on that I was just
going to make the doll play on the show

[48:30]
going to make the doll play on the show
tables and then if people adjust to the
info they adjust to the info and I will
notice that they've adjusted I was just
like I will have the confidence that
yeah if people are going to if people
are going to change something up I'm
going to I'm going to see it and I was

[48:45]
going to I'm going to see it and I was
playing mostly show tables the entire
time so I was like well you know like
probably about a third of my volume was
on the non-show tables so like if they
want to adjust explicitly on those ones
and then just keep leaking the same way
the show Once that's fine like I'll just
take the money and then um I think also

[49:02]
take the money and then um I think also
like having having the confidence in the
fact that like yeah that I wasn't I
wasn't stuck with any of these you know
if someone showed that they if someone
showed they had the adjustment I wasn't
like married to any of the [ __ ] I was

[49:16]
like married to any of the [ __ ] I was
doing I was like happy happy to go ditch
it um yeah I mean it's it's kind of like
having being aware that I could be
people people in a bunch of different
ways made me not worried about giving
away one way cuz I was like if the guy

[49:31]
away one way cuz I was like if the guy
was good enough to not late and play
Perfect GTA like you know like no one is
that good like if they if they patch up
this one wound like something's going to
open Elsewhere for me to go after and
it's just up to me to notice it and like
stay ahead of the

[49:45]
stay ahead of the
matter um and yeah I think I think also
like you know that there were a lot of
people that just weren't paying enough
attention um like some people some
people were some people weren't but like
there were there were definitely spots
where by the end of the challenge I was

[50:00]
where by the end of the challenge I was
like I was kind of surprised that it was
still working the same way it did at the
start and I was like Wow people are
still folding here um I was like yep yep
they are um so then I was just like okay
well I guess I don't need to change

[50:15]
well I guess I don't need to change
anything up against all of these guys
who yeah who have had like this mountain
of showdowns to go through and like I
mean it's also it's like you know
even if they even if they're not
intending to like crush me if they're

[50:31]
intending to like crush me if they're
like oh there's some weaker EG I want to
go after it's still I was so much of the
volume that they should you know it's
like they should have they should have
at least picked up on some things I was
doing but yeah I still I I was still

[50:45]
doing but yeah I still I I was still
getting away with a lot and then like
the guys yeah the guys who were showing
the answers I was like okay yeah I was
like okay fine I just don't run this on
him
specifically um or like you know you can
just play like closer to Fury as well um
cuz it it takes a while to know exactly

[51:02]
cuz it it takes a while to know exactly
whether the GU is like hard over
adjusted the other way you know like if
if you triple barrel and then you see
someone hero call something it's really
hard for you to say like okay was this
specific to this spot was this like
specific to this session or whatever so

[51:18]
specific to this session or whatever so
so yeah I think like just having the
confidence that I could play a close
enough to balanc game
plan um that you know if if someone
wanted to make some extreme adjustment I
could also make the extreme adjustment

[51:30]
could also make the extreme adjustment
wrong I I remember I can't remember the
hand but I just remember the feeling of
like there was a spot where someone like
like full on like Mega torch range
called me like they called like a minus
20 BB catcher somewhere and I was
bluffing but I just remember sitting

[51:46]
bluffing but I just remember sitting
there just being like I'm not playing
the spot badly enough for this to be a
good call like I was just like yeah I
just had that confidence where I was
like well I mean I might be out of blind
but this C is still losing money like
you know feel
free yeah that's that's the thing also

[52:00]
free yeah that's that's the thing also
like I've commentated a bunch of times
and then I remember Yan asking questions
like uh is this uh is this GTO or is
this and was like yeah you know I mean
we don't know with which frequency it
shows up with this hand right so that's
always the problem like obviously if

[52:15]
always the problem like obviously if
someone makes a call that you're like
okay this is clearly not a call he's
doing this for some sort of reason you
know it's also kind of you know if if
you're going to do this and especially
if you call a little bit fast it kind of
reviews that that hey you know he's on
to you so usually what you will see this
is like uh uh usually not too common uh

[52:34]
is like uh uh usually not too common uh
usually it's just like yeah this is a
frequency and we don't know which
frequency they're doing it with so yeah
good good luck finding out uh especially
obviously in the commentating shoes
obviously you're way more engaged and
you're following way more what was going

[52:46]
you're following way more what was going
on Adam in terms of uh paranoia I feel
like this is a a thing that players
struggle with a lot right they get
paranoid I hear this a lot in coaching
especially
uh who are a bit more who take who take
the game a little bit more personal and

[53:00]
the game a little bit more personal and
they say like oh yeah but he's adjusted
now I'm going to readjust and they go
through throughout this whole whole
whole leveling War uh which you know if
we're playing at the level of Owen and
it's indeed them versus them I can
definitely see it but at Mid Stakes you
know where the pools are just way bigger

[53:15]
know where the pools are just way bigger
uh I think it's more often a mistake
than something uh that's actually you
know contributing a lot to the win rate
what triggers people to be paranoid and
how can they uh how can they fix
it yeah I guess it's a lot of the

[53:30]
it yeah I guess it's a lot of the
uncertainty you try to play attack
whilst also playing defense and you're
hoping assuming that you're going to
come out on top but you're also feeling
quite vulnerable so there's no no safety
net like GTO is like oh I can play this
solid they can't get me whereas you're
really going out they going I'm going to

[53:45]
really going out they going I'm going to
try and get you you might get me and
there's that like kind of back and forth
and I think some people don't like that
uneasiness that kind of uncertainty
around who's got the edge who's not and
yeah the less confidence you have in
your kind of problem solving an ability
to stay on top of the meta like on said

[54:01]
to stay on top of the meta like on said
The more paranoid you're going to be
because like if I do this they can explo
me back so yeah I think some players
obviously struggle a lot and they like
to go for more GTO framework I'm
guessing most guys in the challenge
don't fit that bill and they they always
have confidence in themselves to be able
to uh outmaneuver their opponents and

[54:16]
to uh outmaneuver their opponents and
they love that they love the kind of
back and forth I know Owen comes from a
a chess background so you've already got
used to that kind of dynamic of trying
to make attacking play as whil to also
not keeping yourself open so yeah I
think it's the thing players need to
work through but it's just making more
vulnerable but also increasing

[54:31]
vulnerable but also increasing
confidence cuz you might get exited if
you're you're not playing the game well
from a mindset perspective I really want
to dive into the challenge and yeah get
some kind of takeaways from you so going
into the challenge what were your
expectations I know you're a confident
guy were you going for the

[54:45]
guy were you going for the
crown uh yeah I mean I was saying right
from the start that I wanted to win it
um obviously I you know at the start I
was like okay
I can play as well as I like but if I
get Doom switch where I'm bad then uh

[55:03]
get Doom switch where I'm bad then uh
it's out of my control so you know I was
kind of prepared for that um also I like
started the challenge just breaking even
for like quite a while well I say quite
a while like five six days but it's

[55:15]
a while like five six days but it's
quite a lot of hands um so but yeah I I
still remember like even even during
those days I remember thinking to myself
like I I was like so sure I was out
playing people and then I was just like
I was like I'm out playing people and

[55:30]
I was like I'm out playing people and
then someone just gets like like I just
get cooler twice or whatever and then
like it all falls apart um but I was
just sitting there just I just need like
I just need these coers to flip and then
like you know I I I was like I was like
well the the cool is are keeping me in

[55:45]
well the the cool is are keeping me in
check but like once they go around I
mean obviously like you know a lot of
people can feel like this like you can
just feel like when it's yeah it's like
run bad when it doesn't go my way and
all skill when it does but yeah I I had
I had that really distinct impression
and then I had like one day where it

[56:00]
and then I had like one day where it
just felt like I kept making hands or
like all the bluff catches were going
right as well and I won like 12 binds in
a day um and I was like I was like yeah
this is what I was looking for cuz it
felt like it felt like I was like
treading water but like Treading Water

[56:16]
treading water but like Treading Water
by not making like you know not making
very many hands I was just like I don't
know I felt like I was just out
maneuvering people um yeah I mean like
obviously it's hard to be like it's hard
to be objective about these things but
like you know from my subjective

[56:30]
like you know from my subjective
experience I was feeling really
confident the the whole like the whole
way and then like yeah that that was at
the start before ID even like really got
off to any particular lead um and then
uh yeah there was a point where I

[56:45]
uh yeah there was a point where I
started like picking up some momentum
and it just felt like I remember topup
was out in the lead and I I I just felt
like okay it's not if I run top up down
It's when um which is that he you know
it's kind of a delusional thing to say
in like a super high variance

[57:00]
in like a super high variance
environment like you know you see what
happens to some people but like that's
just how how I was feeling throughout um
I think I had like one or like two
sessions throughout the challenge which
I wasn't happy with where I was just
like I was like okay like I didn't like

[57:16]
like I was like okay like I didn't like
I didn't really come to crush people in
these sessions I just sort of played
like
okayish but like even then I didn't
really torch it off um but yeah like
most of the other ones I felt like you
know I went into them like feeling
really confident and then I came out of

[57:31]
really confident and then I came out of
it really happy how I played and you get
like this positive feedback loop right
you're you know you're you're going to
bed satisfied with how you played every
day and then you can like you know you
can wake up the next day with like good
mindset ready to go um this also like

[57:46]
mindset ready to go um this also like
you know not trying to push myself super
hard I just wanted to stay in that aame
sort like mindset throughout the whole
thing um and like not burn myself out
uh so yeah I mean honestly yeah confence
was just running highper out there were

[58:01]
was just running highper out there were
like you know there were moments towards
the end where I was just like you know
gets a bit nervy with like me and rigged
at the top but um but yeah I was
still like the the the thing which was
making me more nervous was just like not

[58:15]
making me more nervous was just like not
that I would actually play any bad poker
I was so sure that if I sat at the
tables I was going to play well um but I
was like like what I was you know what I
was worried about was making the wrong
decision about how much to play cuz

[58:31]
decision about how much to play cuz
there was a point where I hit like I
think I hit like 5 520 and then I
dropped back down to like like 470
actually no no I think I hit 500 and
dropped down to
450 and like rigged was at like 480 or

[58:49]
450 and like rigged was at like 480 or
something um I can't remember yeah I
can't remember the exact but it was
something like that where like if I quit
the session at Peak I would have been
ahead and instead I was at three B down
and like yeah the only thing which was

[59:01]
and like yeah the only thing which was
worrying me was that I would like I
would make a wrong decision about you
know about that about like yeah the
these kind of like soft skills which you
weren't trained for I felt like yeah
immense confidence honestly in
everything that I'd prepped uh it's just

[59:15]
everything that I'd prepped uh it's just
yeah this weird dynamic at the end where
it's just like yeah you might play
really well at a very high win rate and
just like get cooler then lose Stacks um
and then and then like yeah and then
I'll just lose the challenge but I was
like well that's like I I made the

[59:30]
like well that's like I I made the
decision to myself that if I lost I
didn't want it to be because I played to
not lose and then was too timid I was
just like okay I'm going to go out and
like I'm just going to try to win this
thing and then if that doesn't you know

[59:45]
thing and then if that doesn't you know
if that doesn't work it doesn't work um
but yeah I I was like yeah know [ __ ]
like being too worried about this and
playing on the conservative side I'm
just gonna like I'm just GNA play and
like try and Crush people and I think
like rigged had the you know rigged had
the same Outlook we even talked about

[1:00:00]
the same Outlook we even talked about
like you know it was just like let let's
just guarantee some hands on the last
day I think this is supposed to be a
fight like worrying about worrying about
all this stuff with like exactly how
much volume am I supposed to put in when
I'm like this many dollars ahead was not
what we wanted it to be um and yeah I

[1:00:17]
what we wanted it to be um and yeah I
think yeah and so that yeah that that
was the only thing which just B me
honestly everything else I felt like
really good about
throughout what was giving you so much
confidence throughout the challenge I
think you mentioned 3 days you weren't
overly happy but the rest of this like

[1:00:30]
overly happy but the rest of this like
six week challenge you felt great what
do you feel like allowed you to have
confidence you had Edge in almost any
lineup you were
in yeah I mean I think it was it was
it's mostly just like
seeing like seeing the places where I

[1:00:46]
seeing like seeing the places where I
was deviating consistently
work um I think also like the show
tables are quite like nice for staying
in like a very chill place because you
know if if someone pulls a bluff you

[1:01:00]
know if if someone pulls a bluff you
weren't expecting you can be like okay
yeah ah this guy's capable of this I
didn't realize um instead of just
sitting there in doubt for all this time
um I think also generally I'm quite a
confident guy and then when I'm running
well like I'm not I'm not the type to

[1:01:15]
well like I'm not I'm not the type to
get super anxious about it just be like
oh when's the when's the down swing
coming I was more just like okay well
you know everything i' everything under
my control I feel like I'm handling
really well well and then I'm also
running well and like if that goes
together like there's nothing to worry

[1:01:30]
together like there's nothing to worry
about um I was like well if I suddenly
start running badly that'll suck but
that's not
like yeah it's just like every day I was
just thinking about hands and I was like
well even the hands which I'm not happy
with I'm not that unhappy with it's like

[1:01:47]
with I'm not that unhappy with it's like
a small thing where like you know I like
flick it in some hand which I probably
shouldn't have or something or like you
know I miss some call where it's just
like oh actually you know I probably
knew like you know I had just enough

[1:02:01]
knew like you know I had just enough
info that I could have like I could have
actually called this instead of just
like rnging or whatever but like it I
wasn't really um yeah I felt like I
wasn't really making like big mistakes
which would actually cause me to
question myself you know um I was play

[1:02:17]
question myself you know um I was play
like there were some things which are
mistakes in hindsight but given the info
I had at the time I was pretty happy
with them

[1:04:02]
Owen you shared with us on the first
podcast one of your favorite quotes from
a chess Grand Master Mikel tal you must
lead your opponent into a dark forest
with the path leading out is only wide
enough for one do you feel like you let
people into a dark Forest
rout yeah no definitely I feel like I'm

[1:04:15]
rout yeah no definitely I feel like I'm
the kind of guy who's going to um who's
going to post some like complex
questions of people and just be like do
you like do you know how to deal with
this um and it's like if if they know
the answer it's you know it's fine this
can stay a low frequency play you know

[1:04:32]
can stay a low frequency play you know
but uh but if you don't like I'm I'm
going to like you know I'm going to keep
like I'm I'm going to teach you the
answer by like hitting you with it until
you learn um yeah I I feel like yeah
that's something which honestly is the

[1:04:46]
that's something which honestly is the
most fun part of Poker to me is like
just like the often like the early
stages of a heads up match where like
you don't have the other guy worked out
like you know the same this challenge
where there were a lot of people I
didn't have worked out and I was just

[1:05:00]
didn't have worked out and I was just
like okay I'm just going to like prod
them all over the place I'm just going
to test their game plan and like see
where it bends see where it breaks um
and then yeah what what like honestly
once you have the answers it feels like
you're just collecting you know you're

[1:05:15]
you're just collecting you know you're
you're just collecting until they catch
up uh and yeah and they work out how you
are making money off them um but yeah I
I kind of enjoy the process at the start
where you're just sort of like just like
throwing stuff at them and they're
seeing what they can deal with um and
then yeah I mean like almost everyone is

[1:05:31]
then yeah I mean like almost everyone is
going to struggle in some way like well
no I say almost everyone everyone is
going to struggle in some way it's just
up to you to notice what they're not
able to deal with um because yeah yeah
like po poke is just so hard and like
you yeah like in in people's efforts to

[1:05:46]
you yeah like in in people's efforts to
go after you they're leaving their own
weaknesses and all all this stuff um so
so yeah that that that's honestly yeah
the most exciting part for me it feels
like it's strange cuz like when I'm in
the part when I'm in the phase where I'm

[1:06:00]
the part when I'm in the phase where I'm
like kind of just printing EV um and I'm
almost waiting for them to catch back up
because I'm just like I'm just settled
into a rhythm against them and I'm just
like well this would be so much fun once
they work out what's going on and then
we can then we can move on to like the

[1:06:15]
we can then we can move on to like the
next layer of the matter um yeah and
like I I think yeah with show tables
that's happening like quite fast against
like you know at Le at least the top
guys that that's happening quite quickly
uh and so like yeah I enjoyed that you
know real test of staying ahead of

[1:06:30]
know real test of staying ahead of
staying ahead of the counter punches
like because there was some times I
remember
where I hadn't even like I hadn't seen
that they were going to counter me yet
but I could feel it like I was I was
really just like this is the point where

[1:06:45]
really just like this is the point where
the guy is going to like you know he's
going to go the other way and I was just
like you know I was feeling so so
confident as you know you are when
you're running that well and like
playing well um
that I was just like okay no yeah we're
going to go completely against type here
like I'm I'm sure this is the one where

[1:07:01]
like I'm I'm sure this is the one where
he's like he's fed up and he's going to
range call me and I was like okay yeah
this is this is the time where we just
like we just put the whole stack in very
light for Value uh and then I me yeah
like I I think especially when like

[1:07:15]
like I I think especially when like
those work out it's just like okay yeah
I'm so in tune with like the Rhythm and
the game Flow that this guy is playing
at um like that was something which like
I hadn't really been that good that
before in my career I mean it could also
be like it could also just be like
playing very high on confidence and then

[1:07:31]
playing very high on confidence and then
like running well and then attributing
it to skill like it's hard to say with
these things but it felt like it felt
like I I knew like the you know the pace
that things were working at and could
occasionally get ahead of it like
sometimes someone gets to get one back
at you before you realize that you're on
a new level but th those hands where I

[1:07:46]
a new level but th those hands where I
was like I was like no actually this is
a
yeah the The Meta has changed even
though I have no evidence for it and
then it had and that's like yeah that
that feels really uh yeah that that that

[1:08:00]
that feels really uh yeah that that that
really does help with the confence as
well
yeah I remember in our last conversation
you said you've got a bit of a feel for
how people react how player pools react
when you put someone into a certain node
how they're going to respond you've got
like that kind of intuitive nature to it

[1:08:15]
like that kind of intuitive nature to it
and it sounds like you put all these
tests out and you're like all right give
me the counter punch nope not coming
I'll keep hitting this one then when the
counter punch comes you're you're ready
for that next level you enjoy that kind
of next of the game next level of the
The Meta which you enjoy Also I think
you you mentioned earlier that you you

[1:08:31]
you you mentioned earlier that you you
treed like 20 heads of battles I thought
it was an interesting perspective
because that makes it very Dynamic it
makes every individual or someone who
you're going at how important was that
mindset of kind of going after everyone
individually rather than playing like a
a static game
Dynamic yeah yeah I think I think it was

[1:08:47]
Dynamic yeah yeah I think I think it was
like yeah that that was like a lot of my
a lot of my EV in this I think um
I remember
um uh actually I don't want give away
some of specific leaks but I was talking

[1:09:00]
some of specific leaks but I was talking
to okay yeah I can just say in abstract
there was someone who like I was talking
to after the challenge and they and they
were just like they just like I think I
was just looking at the hands and I
noticed you doing this am I really this
out of line here and I was just like I

[1:09:15]
out of line here and I was just like I
was like yeah yeah you really are it's
not like I was like yeah I'm not going
to be like I didn't feel like I could
even be subtle about it there he's just
like yeah he's just like really so like
there was a spot where it's like every
time I raised him I like rais C there

[1:09:30]
time I raised him I like rais C there
was never like it was like the I mean if
you look at you know like
um like there's one at Showdown after
the raise and then where when that
number is like the same as their call
frequency it means like they're just

[1:09:46]
frequency it means like they're just
folding the Bluffs right and he was just
like he was just like you had like 100%
race call in this spot basically or like
I folded like once in a blue moon more
than more than my frequency I was like
that could have just been various I was
like yeah yeah uh which is kind of funny

[1:10:00]
like yeah yeah uh which is kind of funny
that he gave it like he gave away that
he knew that on me he just like um but
yeah we we were just talking kind of
openly and I was like yeah no I uh I I I
pretend that was I pretend that was a
decision but yeah like having those

[1:10:15]
decision but yeah like having those
having those like you know really like
really high confidence individual
adjustment spots is like yeah I I think
it's like it's so important if you're
going to try to beat like if you're if
you're going to try to beat a small pool
it's like if you're if if I'm going to
do it and like you guys aren't going to

[1:10:31]
do it and like you guys aren't going to
try this then or like you're at least
not going to try to keep up then then
you're just at such a huge dis
disadvantage I think that yeah I think
some of the top guys knew this was the
deal um uh and like also you know I I I

[1:10:46]
deal um uh and like also you know I I I
say all this stuff like a lot of the
hands are just good poker but but it's
like yeah it's about like catching those
you know catching those ones where it's
like
it's like generating enough EV that like
every time you catch it it's like really

[1:11:01]
every time you catch it it's like really
contributing to your win rate um and
yeah I I think like I think like a lot
of people did you know didn't really
come come in thinking about that um just
thinking about like the impact of
turning yeah turning some mix into like

[1:11:15]
turning yeah turning some mix into like
a 100%
deviation uh even you know even if it's
rare which is yeah kind of how I was
trying to think about I was just like I
will mostly play well and then just want
to make sure that if there's like a big
EV swing I don't let it pass me by um

[1:11:32]
EV swing I don't let it pass me by um
and and yeah like the the way you find
those big EV swings is by having like a
you know specific understanding of the
player you're up against because like
you know the pool as a whole if you
start to average them is not giving you

[1:11:46]
start to average them is not giving you
those big EV swings in any one given
spot like if you look at someone yeah if
you look at someone like going bet
through bet on on the river over ac
across the pool I think we were probably
doing like you pretty reasonably on that

[1:12:01]
doing like you pretty reasonably on that
in terms of value to Bluff ratio um and
then yeah also it can be more specific
than that because it's not even like
it's not even just the line it will just
be like oh there's a certain texture or
whatever or like you know that there's
something else which goes into it and

[1:12:16]
something else which goes into it and
then if you have a very specific feel
for someone I you can make like you can
make quite a like a big deviation in
those spots um that yeah it it it's just
like so win rate defining um to to to

[1:12:30]
like so win rate defining um to to to
actually have that understanding of
other people rather than just trying to
play your game in a more insula
manner how challenging was it keeping on
top of all the exploits and game
Dynamics versus each player I'm thinking
myself I played heads up I'd often

[1:12:45]
myself I played heads up I'd often
prepare for one opponent play them for
quite a while play another one late that
day we've got a lot of like 20 guys plus
that you're playing throughout how are
you keeping on top of all those Dynamics
and there kind of as of all those
individual little battles that you're
creating for
yourself yeah I mean like it can get it

[1:13:01]
yourself yeah I mean like it can get it
can get a bit overwhelming at times um
but it's more like what I was trying to
do was make sure that I had really good
instincts for the stuff like like I'd
open up the notes and I browse through
them but also like I'm playing like the
same guys every day you know like you
forgotten them a little bit at the start

[1:13:16]
forgotten them a little bit at the start
of a session but you sort of like be
like oh yeah this is the guy that's
going to try to beat me like this this
and this this is what I have to be ready
for um and then uh
yeah and then it sort of refreshes what
like because because yeah that there was

[1:13:30]
like because because yeah that there was
like a week break over Christmas but
it's mostly just you know wake up and we
go again
um so yeah and I and as I said like I
wasn't trying to do this like I wasn't
trying to do this like super rigorous

[1:13:45]
trying to do this like super rigorous
stats breakdown of people it was more
just like a feeling for how they think
about the game it was just like oh if
someone thinks about the game like this
then this is the kind of spot they would
really like to take as a bluff uh and I
have a reasonable capture and everything

[1:14:02]
have a reasonable capture and everything
they've shown me about how they think
about the game makes me think that they
would take this spot so then I so then I
caught um and it's you know instead of
having so I feel like I look at some
people's notes and like I I mean
obviously my notes were probably just

[1:14:16]
obviously my notes were probably just
very suited to me I found something
which works but like some people will
have like very very specific things
about like okay I was in like this line
on like this texture and like you know
some through po cut verus Big blind and

[1:14:31]
some through po cut verus Big blind and
like he did this exact thing and so the
next time we get here I'm going to get
it and whereas I I tried to just have it
broke down to like okay I think when the
sort of they conditions are satisfied it
makes him more likely to Bluff me just
like what what about you know if I broke

[1:14:46]
like what what about you know if I broke
this hand down into something much more
abstract what what was like what was
actually setting them off here um
yeah and once you like I think I think
once you have that you can like have not
seen a spot before it can it can be some

[1:15:01]
seen a spot before it can it can be some
really rare spot but you just get an
intuition of being like oh this sort of
like this weird thing which I think he
might have been going after maybe
applies here um and I think that that's
why I yeah I was feeling so confident in

[1:15:15]
why I yeah I was feeling so confident in
so many my adjustments because a lot of
them were like a lot of them were like
okay yeah I haven't seen the exact spot
but I've kind of got a feeling that this
is how the guy like yeah this is the
sort of spot which I would you know
based on what I've previously seen this
guy would like

[1:15:31]
guy would like
um yeah and yeah just uh yeah like like
it it it sounds harder to keep track of
than it is because it's like you know
the screen if you if you thought to
yourself like okay what are you know
what are the personalities of my friends

[1:15:46]
what are the personalities of my friends
right you know because they're like
individual people and you're not trying
to like your brain is suited to meor
like to remembering
things like that like characteristics if
you try to remember like a whole table
of numbers your brain isn't suited to

[1:16:00]
of numbers your brain isn't suited to
remembering that so I think like the
things that I was trying to remember are
the kind of things which you can like
easily recall like when you see a screen
name right um yeah it's just uh and and
then also because of the show tables
they would remind me that's what they

[1:16:15]
they would remind me that's what they
like to do in other hands cuz I'd be
playing three tables and i' I'd be
watching hands that I'm not in like I
intentionally play fre tables so that I
get a bit like bored and like treat
every hand as like you know as an
important thing um so so yeah I'd be

[1:16:31]
important thing um so so yeah I'd be
playing three tables and like I just see
like you're just constantly getting
reminders of being like okay yeah uh I
mean it doesn't necessarily mean he's
going to go after me in the same way but
like oh I've just seen him you know I've
seen him do something like which I would

[1:16:45]
seen him do something like which I would
expect him to do like I see someone else
in a bluff couching spot and then I'm
just like I would really call here and
then even if they fold and it's just
like oh yeah no he did have like did
have the bluff and yeah just constantly
like yeah the instincts are yeah just
being being like constantly

[1:17:02]
being being like constantly
trained super interesting yeah it's
almost like you're creating a little
character with all these kind of
character traits and how they think and
really trying to get into their an
understand of how they they act I think
I remember from the previous
conversation you talking about theories

[1:17:15]
conversation you talking about theories
of learning and how you like to kind of
put down what you think in advance and
then when the new information comes in
you're able to kind of stress test that
was it right was it wrong and it's
sticks better and it feels like with all
these players you're kind of evolving
your strategy against them either
they're proven you are right yes it's

[1:17:31]
they're proven you are right yes it's
this guy plays this way he's like oh
he's moved he's Dev there okay awesome
and counter punch here or get him back
sounds like this kind of very in truee
with your your pool but you've created
like a something in your own mind where
it makes it very easy to remember or
very fluid and I felt like throughout
the the challenge you felt in tune with

[1:17:45]
the the challenge you felt in tune with
that a step ahead of that and I know
you're a very competitive guy we
mentioned already H how much should the
role of kind of Eagle I'll use it that
term play a role in terms of you want to
win I'm guessing other players weren't
as hardcore wanting to win as you were
and yeah how do you deal with that and

[1:18:00]
and yeah how do you deal with that and
channel that in the right way during the
Championships yeah I mean I think
um yeah I I I felt like I had a lot more
to prove than the other guys to some
extent I mean
like uh yeah I like someone like lonus

[1:18:15]
like uh yeah I like someone like lonus
like whether he wins or he doesn't he's
got so many accolades um but uh yeah I I
kind of felt I I kind of felt coming
into this that I was like
okay
uh like yeah in in a weird way I wanted

[1:18:31]
uh like yeah in in a weird way I wanted
to be like you know no one knows how
good I am I want to I want to show how
[ __ ] good I am at this
um yeah and so it it which is just very
motivating for me it didn't um I feel
like I kind of Thrive Under Pressure

[1:18:48]
like I kind of Thrive Under Pressure
honestly um yeah it just makes me like
yeah makes me just sharpen up um and it
doesn't yeah I mean it's hard to say
whether it would have got to me if
things started going against me because

[1:19:01]
things started going against me because
because I had a pretty smooth ride on uh
throughout uh but yeah I I think
generally putting pressure on myself
tends to work you know I mean we talked
about like the nickname um or it's fre
name or whatever uh

[1:19:16]
name or whatever uh
and yeah I I think that um I think that
yeah like I even tried to create
artificial pressure on myself so like
having the actual pressure of
competition like uh really gets me to

[1:19:30]
competition like uh really gets me to
sharpen up like one thing I've noticed
when I play um when I play Tores at
least is that being on the final table
like yeah that would be to some extent
it would make me nervous but I would
also very consistently play my best
poker on Final tables um which yeah is

[1:19:47]
poker on Final tables um which yeah is
just quite an asset like I can't uh yeah
I can't I can't speak to what to do if
those situations make you nervous cuz
it's just not something I've had to deal
with you know like I just naturally tend
to be excited to try and meet the

[1:20:01]
to be excited to try and meet the
challenge um so yeah yeah it's just a
just a gift I
guess what is it about pressure that you
thrive on what's s the internal state
that you experienc in does it sharpen
your focus what why is it why is it Spar

[1:20:16]
your focus what why is it why is it Spar
something new yeah I feel like it it's
the fact that um nothing is
given if you're you know if you're
playing in a tough game where you know
there there was literally no prize to
Second Place uh and it's like okay I

[1:20:32]
Second Place uh and it's like okay I
kind of have to go out and earn this
there's no you know there's no like half
measures to this and also just like a
general like outlook on things that I I
really don't want to have any
excuses uh you know it's like if

[1:20:47]
excuses uh you know it's like if
obviously like it's temping to make them
and I catch myself doing it all the time
but I always feel like if I'm going
after something if there's some goal on
pursuing that I don't want to I I never
want to be sat there at the end like oh
I could have done it but this um yeah I

[1:21:03]
I could have done it but this um yeah I
I I always want to be like okay I
literally gave this you know I gave this
everything and if I didn't make it
here's what I could change and here's
what I could do better next time um and
I think yeah just knowing that there's

[1:21:15]
I think yeah just knowing that there's
no room to you know knowing there's no
room to be like cocky about things and
like let it just go Um cuz yeah
especially at the point where like
rigged was on some massive upswing I
remember just it just feeling like okay

[1:21:30]
remember just it just feeling like okay
well now I just have no choice except to
play amazingly like there's just like no
there there's no other option if I don't
I'm going to lose um and so yeah it was
kind of just a simple like simple thing
for me to process um yeah I I yeah it'd

[1:21:47]
for me to process um yeah I I yeah it'd
be hard to say why some people crumble
under that I mean it's like i' I've had
a lot of practicing though like even
from a young age like I was playing
chess at a young age and
um you know I've be trying to like doing

[1:22:00]
um you know I've be trying to like doing
the trials to get into the England team
or like qualify for the trials or
whatever all that stuff uh and it's like
doing that at like 10 and 11 years old
um and then also you know having some
success with it helped but yeah just
really

[1:22:15]
really
enjoying like you know get getting used
to the process of like being like you
know nervous about something uh
especially when you're that age but then
like going going in and being like okay
you know it's it's still on me right
especially in a very deterministic game

[1:22:30]
especially in a very deterministic game
like chess where it's just like if you
play well you win um and then yeah
coming away and you know it is kind of a
high in a sense like obviously you don't
understand that at like 10 or 11 years
old but um yeah like there there's like
a thriller competition I've always been

[1:22:45]
a thriller competition I've always been
very competitive my whole life I'm like
yeah competive about everything uh like
I can you know like I I I scale it back
now but yeah like yeah it's just be
always something you know like playing
sports or like board games or like

[1:23:00]
sports or like board games or like
werewolf or anything like that I just
really want to you know I really want to
win and I say well if I want to win I
just have to play well that's like yeah
it's just it's just very easy for my
brain to process
that yeah it's super interesting so for

[1:23:15]
that yeah it's super interesting so for
you like when you want to play well
you've got a lot of pressure on you is
there anything you need to do to Prime
yourself or to prepare yourself to
perform well or do you just hit a switch
and you go into a a certain frame of
mind that allows you to perform I'm

[1:23:30]
mind that allows you to perform I'm
saying this because obviously you play
for six weeks and to perform really well
when you want to is not a given and it's
some players I'm sure throughout the
challenge would have struggled obviously
you had high confidence have great
results how do you kind of lean towards
high performance more frequently for

[1:23:45]
high performance more frequently for
yourself well I I'd honestly say when
the games are really tough it is kind of
effortless for me when when like when
the games are softer it's actually way
harder for me to hit that level because
I'm aware that I have a buffer you know
if there's a fish at the table and it's

[1:24:00]
if there's a fish at the table and it's
just like okay well like we have like a
5bb like buffer which the fish is like
giving to everyone just for playing okay
and then like forcing myself to play
like super sharp is harder because you
know I would often think it in terms of

[1:24:15]
know I would often think it in terms of
like a sort of binary way like oh am I
beating the game this like gu and like
um but yeah I I I think like as long as
I can get that mindset of like okay well
yeah one of the ways I think about poker
is actually

[1:24:30]
is actually
um so so I remember
having uh this came back from when I was
doing like a Philosophy degree but I
remember hearing about this idea of like
uh like negative powers like
constitutions just like okay this is a
big tangent but um it's like this idea

[1:24:46]
big tangent but um it's like this idea
from political philosophy that like a
negative poers Constitution is like it
just tells you all the things that you
can't do right so it's like everything
is good apart from like these things you
can't
do um and so you know as as opposed to

[1:25:01]
do um and so you know as as opposed to
the other one which will say like these
are all the things which you have a
right to do and then I was thinking I
often think about like poker in the same
sense of being like there is like a
perfect way to play and then everything
else is like a negative Powers version
of that where everything else is like a

[1:25:16]
of that where everything else is like a
mistake below this perfect you know
below this optimal way to play given you
know the info you have about the player
you're up against which yeah I I I said
to people can make me really tilting to
do hand reviews with because if you play
a hand really well I sort of just nod

[1:25:30]
a hand really well I sort of just nod
and go yeah nice and then move on um
because if you make even like a small
mistake I'm really nitpicky uh because I
just like no no you had the info like
like this line is underperforming like
you know this is like yeah yeah this is

[1:25:45]
you know this is like yeah yeah this is
high confidence that you shouldn't be
doing this against gu like we got to do
it sometimes it's like yeah but anyway
um but yeah and I think like when I get
into that mindset of
like um yeah this like perfectionist
mindset where it's like I'm trying to

[1:26:01]
mindset where it's like I'm trying to
keep my you know I'm trying to keep my
distance from perfect play as close to
zero as possible and not giving myself
like you know not giving myself any
excuses again of being like okay
well yeah I mean like this was this was

[1:26:16]
well yeah I mean like this was this was
bad given like what had gone on recently
between us and what I know about this
guy and like or but you know I only
rnged it so it's not but like I mean
obviously that makes it better than
doing something pure but just thinking
to myself like no that that was an

[1:26:30]
to myself like no that that was an
opportunity missed like even if it's
only like a big blind or two big blinds
adjustment it's like that's still like
that's still quite big when win rates
are fragile right like every single time
you find like a 1bb adjustment it's like
amazing um so yeah yeah just just trying

[1:26:46]
amazing um so yeah yeah just just trying
to just trying to be in that be in that
head space where like I'm not letting
anything go and I'm I'm using like every
piece of info I have available to me
uh yeah that that that's that's what
works for me
personally how do you make sure you

[1:27:00]
personally how do you make sure you
don't push that perfectionism too far
you mentioned like nitpicking everything
almost having like the perfect standard
here and anything below is kind of a
mistake that you want to make sure you
close that Gap how do you use that
constructively with yourself to make
sure you're not overly critical or maybe
looking at too many things or how do you

[1:27:16]
looking at too many things or how do you
kind of channel that perfectionism to uh
make sure it's always proactive without
being uh too much for yourself
um I I feel like for me because um so so

[1:27:34]
um I I feel like for me because um so so
one way that I'm kind of like easy on
myself because that's way that's the way
that I'm kind of being hard on myself
but one way that I'm easy on myself is
that I'm not
expecting like whilst I'm aiming for
Perfection I'm not actually expecting to

[1:27:45]
Perfection I'm not actually expecting to
hit it and then part of my process is
just getting a little bit closer each
time so like if there are mistakes I
always look at it as like this is a
mistake I made like
now um and like this is just part of the

[1:28:01]
now um and like this is just part of the
process of not making it again uh and
always looking at things through this
very iterative mindset of um you know if
you're trying to get to Perfection like
you you kind of have to like chisel away
to it um yeah like um like I does this

[1:28:18]
to it um yeah like um like I does this
sculpture I really like actually where
it's where it's like the the like so
basically basically like there there's
like this guy who with a chisel who's
carving himself he's like you know made
of marble and like yeah he's carving

[1:28:31]
of marble and like yeah he's carving
himself out of the stone and like this
idea that yeah you get to you know you
you get to Perfection like one like
little tap of the Chisel at a time uh
and like I'm not there yet and like
maybe you never get maybe you never get
there in fact you obviously won't but

[1:28:46]
there in fact you obviously won't but
like just yeah just being like process
oriented um and so yeah it's it's kind
of it's almost like cognitive distance
you know but uh like you just have to
you have to like they're almost opposing

[1:29:01]
you have to like they're almost opposing
views but um but yeah I mean well to be
very cliched it's like uh shoot for the
moon and even if you miss you land Among
the Stars right which is kind which is
kind of how I think about I'm just like
setting really high goals for myself but

[1:29:15]
setting really high goals for myself but
I'm also with the knowledge that like
the goals are like insane um so so then
if I don't meet them it's more just like
okay I'll come back the next day and be
a little bit
close yeah I like that balance of kind
of shooting for the moon but also being

[1:29:30]
of shooting for the moon but also being
realistic that it's like a a small step
towards that rather than maybe landed at
the Final Destination so yeah I think
it's a a good way to balance that but
yeah you said you set ridiculously high
goals and don't have to get there but
the goal last time on the podcast was to
be number one and a year and a half
later you're you're right there so yeah

[1:29:47]
later you're you're right there so yeah
it's amazing to to see all the the
journey you've went on and kind of the
way you talk but also like the
confidence yourself and how you back
that update a day so yeah amazing
journey Ry want to pass to you uh how do
you think about pressure for yourself so

[1:30:01]
you think about pressure for yourself so
o was talking a lot there about thriving
Under Pressure how he performs at his
best and playing of tough lineups give
me that I'm I'm good to go I don't need
anything else that's not often not the
default how do you respond or have you
noted other players responding to being
in pressure

[1:30:16]
in pressure
scenarios so it really it really depends
like pressure can come from from many
angles I definitely think the more you
feel like is on the line to lose the
more the pressure there is right is for
example your identity is really tied to

[1:30:30]
example your identity is really tied to
uh to Poker or for example you need to
perform because you know you need to pay
rent at the end of the month these are
like circumstances that make it harder
for you to appreciate the pressure um so
it's usually I feel like a reframing of

[1:30:45]
it's usually I feel like a reframing of
the the event itself I wrote down
actually that always said he feels
excited right where other people can
feel like oh I'm nervous and then kind
of freak out by it he feels the same
Sensations but that sensation is like oh
nice I'm excited let's go you know so I

[1:31:00]
nice I'm excited let's go you know so I
feel like a lot of it is is the
interpretation of the sensations that
you have and kind of the label that you
give it um other than obviously like I
said the circumstances in your life like
I said if if if it's financially very
important for you to succeed yeah uh I
can tell you already right now you're

[1:31:15]
can tell you already right now you're
most likely not going to succeed because
it's just too important to you and then
you cannot enjoy the pressure show you
know it's called kind of the the flow
The Sweet Spot right in ter terms of uh
how much pressure you take on if you and
also like the confidence right if Owen
is up against guys that simply too good

[1:31:32]
is up against guys that simply too good
you know and he doesn't meet the skill
level and he doesn't have the confidence
and you just get beat down all the time
yeah you're not going to perform well so
you need to have kind of that sweet but
you need you know where where where kind
of the challenge is adequate to your
skill level it's not too easy not too
hard that's also what Owen was

[1:31:45]
hard that's also what Owen was
describing right when there's a fish the
table when the game is maybe a little
bit quotequote easier it actually
becomes harder for him so it's really
interesting because your mind kind of
goes like oh this game is easier this
kind of the default response but
actually for Owen it's harder so he kind
of has to read no way wait this is

[1:32:01]
of has to read no way wait this is
actually not easy this is harder for me
so I actually have to pay attention
right but it doesn't really come it
doesn't really come naturally um we
talked a little bit about uh your day
today I remember also from our last
conversation you were really big on like
uh balance right you like you had

[1:32:16]
uh balance right you like you had
certain hobby I Remember music fashion
you love to spend time with your friends
your social life throughout this six we
period did you go all in on like this
challenge or did you did you try to uh
keep the

[1:32:30]
keep the
balance um yeah no that was definitely
like there was definitely balance in it
yeah I wasn't trying to I wasn't trying
to B myself out at all um yeah I I met
like a load of cool people around
Vegas um and then uh yeah I remember

[1:32:47]
Vegas um and then uh yeah I remember
even like with a few days to go I was
like I was at like a concert um just
chilling with people having good time uh
you know with llama and then some of
some people you know they were his
friends but now I could sit online like

[1:33:00]
friends but now I could sit online like
some really cool people um and like we
even went like we went like skiing with
like K I think that was like a week to
go and we were just like we just like
[ __ ] it we'll drive up to the mountains
it's only like two and a half hours away
so yeah we went um went skiing so yeah I

[1:33:16]
so yeah we went um went skiing so yeah I
was kind of I was like don't get me
wrong like I was focused on the
challenge um and there were you know
there were some things which got vetoed
in favor of me just staying sharp and
like being able to give my Al to it um

[1:33:31]
like being able to give my Al to it um
but yeah I mean I I I knew it wasn't
going to be all my time and I also I
also aware of the fact that I recover a
lot quicker if you know if I'm actually
doing stuff which I enjoy outside of it

[1:33:45]
doing stuff which I enjoy outside of it
like um I don't know if you done many of
those big leaderboard grinds in your
career but like I've always found like
if you end up playing like these super
long sessions multiple days in a row the
recovery time is so long whereas if
you're a bit more relaxed about it and

[1:34:00]
you're a bit more relaxed about it and
then you're playing like you you end up
getting in like more total high quality
hours and especially like high quality
hours were important to me because I was
like well if I be game like if I be game
What's even the point of playing like
you know like maybe I can you maybe I

[1:34:17]
you know like maybe I can you maybe I
can have like some win rate if I'm like
playing some softer games or whatever
but I was just like that's so pointless
to just like it's not like it's not like
yeah there's some big spot there who's
making it worth showing up when you're

[1:34:31]
making it worth showing up when you're
not playing well and then like
increasing your recovery time
exponentially by going past the point
where you're
exhausted um so yeah it was just it was
just more important to me to yeah just
like stay fresh like you know go out
have like have some fun and then just

[1:34:46]
have like have some fun and then just
come back to the table refreshed and
um yeah yeah just just make make sure
that uh
make sure more that I'm like staying
sharp over the long term than uh than
yeah any particular like it's like oh

[1:35:01]
yeah any particular like it's like oh
like no fun until I play a 10 hour
session today I was saying like no not
really like if I didn't feel like
playing I just wouldn't play um I just
wake up and see how I felt and I'd just
be like okay well there'd be some days
where I'd like I'd like go on the stream

[1:35:15]
where I'd like I'd like go on the stream
with Yan and he would just be like you
going to go play I was like
no is like really on youing I was like
yeah but I'm tired I'll was just like
I'll just hang out with you for a bit
and then like I'll go like you know hang
with llamas of people later and then

[1:35:31]
with llamas of people later and then
I'll just come back tomorrow refreshed
he was like okay he kind of like he was
kind of he's he was kind of skeptical of
my plan but uh yeah yeah I just
like sorry yeah do any D stay stay out

[1:35:45]
like sorry yeah do any D stay stay out
for stand out for you like during during
the championship that were either
particularly good or maybe also
particularly challenging I think you had
pretty smooth ride but does a day stand
out where where where it was a bit more
challenging for
you

[1:36:01]
you
um I mean most of the most stressful
days were when like well actually when I
wasn't playing because I wouldn't be
playing and people would just send me
pictures of rigged stacking people and I
would just be like I'm trying to relax

[1:36:17]
would just be like I'm trying to relax
like this is you know like obviously
they're not doing it from like like
they're doing it from like a good place
I like to think at least they weren't
just doing it to torch me but like I
would just be like you know there's
plenty of time left and it's like what

[1:36:31]
plenty of time left and it's like what
would he stacking people or not like I
need to you know I need to get in um
this time to just chill and uh yeah like
but like when it's out of my control it
felt so much more stressful and then um

[1:36:45]
felt so much more stressful and then um
and also like you know deciding whether
to play and all that stuff was so much
more stressful like once I was like you
know once I was at the tables I felt
like very calm
uh like even if things even if things
were going against me I was like you
know I'd be getting stacked or whatever

[1:37:00]
know I'd be getting stacked or whatever
but I'd just be like oh well like you
know
s which I guess is easy to do when
you're on the upswing of Lifetime um you
know both in these games and and
others
um but uh yeah I I don't know I I wasn't

[1:37:16]
um but uh yeah I I don't know I I wasn't
particularly stressed I mean like you
know the GF was a pretty nice ride to
the top like some parts they feel like
you know they feel rough while you're in
them but like then you you know like
after a while it became a point where I
could just zoom out and just be like

[1:37:30]
could just zoom out and just be like
well yeah I'm clearly playing on top of
my game and um yeah I I think as well
like at some point I it's also like well
even if I get hit by like some really
bad variants right now I was like well
I've played so well and I've made a

[1:37:45]
I've played so well and I've made a
bunch of money and yeah I was like it
would suck not to get the not to win the
Rolex like this close but I was like you
know like just still focus on like
control what you can control and all
that and like not get um not get too
worried yeah but again easy to say when

[1:38:02]
worried yeah but again easy to say when
you're running well like if I just got
like if I just got like kings into Aces
a bunch of times in a row like maybe you
know maybe the stress would have started
to hit like I RI rig's up swing went
like um even further but uh yeah I don't

[1:38:16]
like um even further but uh yeah I don't
know for the most part just like very
relaxed you kind of already established
sort of uh your own top five in the
conversation Who besides that uh were
you impressed by during the challenge
that you maybe did not expect uh to be

[1:38:31]
that you maybe did not expect uh to be
impressed by before the
started I mean uh like very early on
like this is before he became like a
serious Contender very early on I was
talking to people about how much better
rigged had
got um like I think like he might have

[1:38:48]
got um like I think like he might have
been up there a bit I think it was like
so there was like top up in Kevin at at
the top and then like liners maybe I
think those were the top three and there
was like me rigged and a few others who

[1:39:00]
was like me rigged and a few others who
are like I think like top up had 200k
and we were sitting around 100 or
something like that uh I remember
someone asking me um like whatever was
just like oh yeah like is R like legit

[1:39:15]
just like oh yeah like is R like legit
and I was like yeah no he's been like I
I became very aware very quickly that CU
we we battled quite a bit on ACR I was
like some of the things that I was doing
against him just aren't [ __ ] working
and like yeah some someone else was
saying like the same thing they were
just like oh yeah I had I had reads on

[1:39:31]
just like oh yeah I had I had reads on
rigged and it feels like it feels like
he's read my reads on him
um and uh yeah yeah he he was definitely
like yeah he he he was like playing
really well and like obviously you know
confidence is really high and like it

[1:39:46]
confidence is really high and like it
helps you to stay in that place uh again
he's like pushing it right into the
wire um I've I've talked about this
quite a lot how how much Kevin impressed
me I didn't realize actually how good
Kevin was going to be like I'd always
known he was like a high level player

[1:40:02]
known he was like a high level player
but I did yeah I I really didn't realize
just how sharp he was going to be um
also like yeah like flushy came in as
well and I wasn't yeah I didn't know I
didn't know how good flushy was going to
be because it was
like I know he's played all these heads

[1:40:16]
like I know he's played all these heads
up battles but obviously it's like you
know heads up and six backs are
different games uh also I was wondering
how seriously he was going to take take
it cuz it was quite small for him um but
yeah at first when he came in I saw a
lot of people just being like Oh flushy

[1:40:30]
lot of people just being like Oh flushy
such a pter he's so spewy and then I was
just like yeah but like he's spewing in
a way I'm kind of you know I'm kind of
behind it like he might be a bit too
much sometimes but like I was just like
no no I I I like really liked a lot of

[1:40:45]
no no I I I like really liked a lot of
the stuff he was doing um yeah I was
really impressed with uh really
impressed with what he was doing um yeah
it's just like and if this isn't even
his main game I don't I I don't know
what the balance is for him but I know
he's played like tons of heads up
battles versus like Barry and lonus and

[1:41:00]
battles versus like Barry and lonus and
whoever um so as I say if this isn't
even his main game he must be like he
must be pretty [ __ ] sharp uh does
anything Stand Out particularly that you
were like you that like a hand maybe
that he played where like wow this guy
knows his [ __ ] oh yeah no I yeah the

[1:41:17]
knows his [ __ ] oh yeah no I yeah the
exact hand where he like it was one of
those ones where like versus most people
I would have like would have been like
okay it it was on a non-show table but
it came up later on a review CU I got
owned but like I think this is most

[1:41:31]
owned but like I think this is most
people would have been able to come away
from it and feel like pretty good about
the fold but I remember against him just
like for like the rest of the session
just being like trying to get out my
head but being like did he did he [ __ ]
me up there um it was like uh I can't

[1:41:48]
me up there um it was like uh I can't
remember the exact texture but it was a
fre pot and it was I think it might be
like a74 for rainbow uh button versus
big blind I'm in the big
blind uh and I go like I bet

[1:42:00]
blind uh and I go like I bet
10% uh he
huls uh and in the turns like I think
it's a deuce I can't remember if it
brings a back to fler or not but anyway
the turn goes check check there rers a

[1:42:15]
the turn goes check check there rers a
10 we're 200 big blind Deep by the way
there is a 10 and I go for a small overb
it's like I think it's 125% pop
uh and he
ripped uh like just all in and I was
just saying that I had

[1:42:30]
just saying that I had
AK so so we were [ __ ] trapping but
not anymore um like yeah I just remember
sitting there and just being like being
like very aware that I like didn't have
a direction I wanted to go in in the

[1:42:45]
a direction I wanted to go in in the
hand um like being like Oh God am I yeah
I'm just going to have to RNG this one
like um and then like yeah uh and and
then later on I found out he had 109
which is just a very sharply played hand

[1:43:01]
which is just a very sharply played hand
yeah he had do
um
[ __ ] think like King 10 or something you
know yeah yeah yeah I mean I I I I also
like I remember looking back on it and I
don't think I realized this at the time
I had the perfect Ace King to call cuz I

[1:43:15]
I had the perfect Ace King to call cuz I
had the king same suit as the 10 so I'm
unblocking King 10 and then I also had
an ace which is blocking his Ace 10
suited so I think I had the ace King
which is supposed to call and I didn't
so
um yeah well I mean it's probably not a

[1:43:31]
um yeah well I mean it's probably not a
pure call but it's it's one of the
higher mixes and I think I like I I was
like kind of flustered by the line like
it was like it was one of those spots
where like I really wasn't expecting
to okay like obviously I know jams are

[1:43:46]
to okay like obviously I know jams are
going to come in there but I kind of
hadn't thought about it because I was
like oh if he jams I'm going to like I'm
going to know what's going on and then
like I realized as he was tanking I was
just like I actually don't like I don't
know what to do if he jams here like I

[1:44:01]
know what to do if he jams here like I
was I was just very um yeah yeah I I I
was aware that like yeah there's a
chance of full stack goes in like two
stacks I guess we 200 mil deep and I was
like I'm not going to think I'm actually
not going to yeah I'm not going to have

[1:44:15]
not going to yeah I'm not going to have
an adjustment ready here like um and
yeah thinking that in advance and then
the stack went in and I was like well
yeah we haven't come up with anything so
I end up like tanking for ages and like
RNG I fold and yeah later find out he
gets me with the 109 I was really scared
though before um before seeing what he

[1:44:32]
though before um before seeing what he
had cuz like 109 is just a really like
sharp hand to have here right like
blocking a 10 pocket T I was like really
scared he was going to have some like
super [ __ ] you hand cuz like that that
was where I was at with him I was like

[1:44:45]
was where I was at with him I was like
okay like he can do like you know he can
play these really sharp like very
accurate Bluffs and be very balanced
with you or like like you know close
enough to balance that it's hard to get
a read even with the show tables or he
can just go [ __ ] you and just like rip
his pocket eights here even though it's

[1:45:00]
his pocket eights here even though it's
like a horrible Bluff but he's just like
this guy's going to [ __ ] fa um and so
yeah that I remember having that feeling
where I was just like I could be getting
like I could be getting full on Range
bluffed here like but like I was like
you can't just fear call someone for 200

[1:45:16]
you can't just fear call someone for 200
bigs just in case they're trying to own
you like um so I was like I like okay
well I guess I'm just going to have to
I'm going to have to handle it the best
way I can um yeah I also remember as
well a bit at the time like yeah like
playing like I was a bit Bame like I

[1:45:31]
playing like I was a bit Bame like I
wasn't happy with how I played the hand
really
throughout well not just the hand but
like also the session I wasn't like I
wasn't playing like super sharply during
that session um and then that just being
a stand out moment where I was just like
oh like I I am the punching bag getting

[1:45:46]
oh like I I am the punching bag getting
hit here and like not knowing what's
going on and so much prefer being on the
other side this isn't as fun
um yeah I back way but
yeah in in our previous conversation

[1:46:01]
yeah in in our previous conversation
You' talked about your game and that you
often balance a thin line between
Brilliance and and punting uh any any
moments of brilli Brilliance uh that
stand out during this Challenge and also
maybe uh any punt that comes to

[1:46:16]
maybe uh any punt that comes to
mind uh yeah I mean like I I guess we
can go for another flushy hand although
ah actually I mean does Dey need a shout
out yeah Dei insists that I didn't own
him in the challenge when I think
basically every hand that showed down I

[1:46:30]
basically every hand that showed down I
owned him so [ __ ] hard um
like um but uh oh yeah okay that there's
a there's there's a fun spot versus Dey
actually uh I think so I've been cut off
he's in the big blind uh and it's like

[1:46:47]
he's in the big blind uh and it's like
king93 with a flush draw just like
single race po uh
I like Po the Flop with like Ace Jack
with the Jacky back door uh and I have

[1:47:01]
with the Jacky back door uh and I have
the ace blocking the back door not flush
draw as well I think and then the turns
of
10 um pretty high frequency turn Barrel
but not
always um so it goes goes check

[1:47:17]
always um so it goes goes check
check uh and then the river's a king
completing the
flu uh he checks to me my hand basically
supposed to be a pure bat um but I was
just sat there like I was s there like H
I don't think any trips are coming back

[1:47:31]
I don't think any trips are coming back
to me if I go for this um like I was you
know I was thinking like uh I can like
over bet to rep The Flash or like even
like Ace King which pots then checks
back so no I don't really feel it and I
couldn't even put my finger on why I was
I just think de is [ __ ] strong here

[1:47:46]
I just think de is [ __ ] strong here
and I check back in here the flush I was
like yeah that's you know I've got I've
got a pure Bluff I know it's a pure
Bluff or it's like it's like a 90% Bluff
was I and I was like
well yeah I don't know I just didn't
feel like giving my money like

[1:48:01]
feel like giving my money like
everything was screaming at me just like
don't Bluff him here uh and I was like
yeah yeah yeah I just like not going to
yeah not going to take that one
um yeah but yeah it was it was funny
like like because we me and Dey went

[1:48:16]
like like because we me and Dey went
over some hands afterwards we going over
them with um I think it was
sunny uh and then he was just like he
was just like showing need the solver
output for it and I was like yeah but
you have a flush like you're telling me
I suppos to BL you have a flush like why

[1:48:30]
I suppos to BL you have a flush like why
why would I Blu if you're not
folding I think um yeah it was kind of
funny because I I think he thought I was
like I think he thought just off of like
the a lot of the when I do hand reviews
I mostly just talk about Fury right I'm
not going to give away like all the

[1:48:45]
not going to give away like all the
secret Source but I think he thought I
was more of a robot than I was and he
was just like oh you you missed this
Bluff it's like no no no
I knew I was supposed to I just wasn't
feeling it unlucky man and uh yeah there
there were a few other spots as well

[1:49:00]
there were a few other spots as well
where I just remember like yeah I had
hands which were yeah there was one spot
where I was just like I'm supposed to
like I was like I had a hand which was
supposed to like mix folds and I was
like ah but like I could tell how
excited you were to show off that you

[1:49:15]
excited you were to show off that you
knew how to Bluff this spot so I range
called you he was like what the [ __ ] he
was just like and he did he did the
thing where he was like I would go so P
for Value here I was like did you have
value he's just telling like you know

[1:49:30]
value he's just telling like you know
there's all this stuff on the board he's
just like like there a flush complete on
the board he's just like out of jam
straight no no sweat like and I was just
like okay yeah but you didn't have a
straight you you know you had like this
random like flare Bluff that you wanted
to you know you wanted to make the

[1:49:45]
to you know you wanted to make the
Highlight reals but
unlucky from the opposite perspective
any any big punt that stands out that
you did you
regret um big
punts oh God I mean every [ __ ] time I

[1:50:01]
punts oh God I mean every [ __ ] time I
put a stuck in against
Moon um a big
puns God see I don't have the DB but um
because it's just like not downloading
and it's all in
Vegas

[1:50:19]
um some really bad hands I played I
don't know movie just got selected
memory I just deleted I was going to say
this is a good sign man this is a good
sign if I you ask me hey do you have any
puns and say yeah let's go over there

[1:50:31]
puns and say yeah let's go over there
man
Mark yeah I
mean I don't know like oh what would be
some really big
PS I mean I got some hands where like I
made some small mistakes but like

[1:50:45]
made some small mistakes but like
nothing I mean okay I I'll talk about
Amun as well Mar I just tried to bully
him super hard like and it didn't go
well and he just I'm pretty sure he
ranged
um so it's like bot versus big blind
singer race pot and B it's like Ace
Queen something I'm going to say a queen

[1:51:01]
Queen something I'm going to say a queen
for
rainbow okay I have Queen
n uh he checks to me I po the Flop this
is like low frequency pop but it's in
there
um yeah uh and then he calls turn is an

[1:51:18]
um yeah uh and then he calls turn is an
ace it's quite an interesting
turn uh this supposed to be like some
donkey on it you can dunk this at pretty
decent
frequency um for quite small though um

[1:51:31]
frequency um for quite small though um
and yeah if he checks over to me um well
I check back the queen n here obviously
uh and then the river is a
two um which is kind of an interesting
card because like I'm going to pot the

[1:51:45]
card because like I'm going to pot the
Flop very often with
Deuces and then if like hit the back
door boat here cuz it's not going to
continue barreling when the board pairs
and it can Showdown versus King Jack
king
T um so I do have that also when the ace
pairs I do like there's a lot of slow

[1:52:00]
pairs I do like there's a lot of slow
playing from me um because like so much
of my value range gets cut
um the uh yeah like there's there's just
a bunch of checking backward boats here
and munus is like

[1:52:16]
and munus is like
b75 um and I shove the queen n sort of
figuring like um the nine is an
Unblocker to his gut
shots uh the Queen's kind of whatever he
doesn't really have a queen here but um

[1:52:33]
doesn't really have a queen here but um
so I mean like maybe I'd rather have a
four but uh or like a river Deuce even
but like those are you know those are
pretty rare hands and I was just like I
was just like [ __ ] it I I I I have pure

[1:52:45]
was just like [ __ ] it I I I I have pure
unblockers like have a lot of value here
um I like to think IED I might have just
P went for it I'm sure like I'm I just
being like [ __ ] it this looks strong
moon will f um like like who try who
tries to rep they check back a boat here

[1:53:01]
tries to rep they check back a boat here
right and then it's like yeah BL here
you know yeah yeah it's like what do you
even Bluff here [ __ ] it Bluff my hand
um he tanks for a while and he calls Ace
10 um which might seem like okay that's
kind of top of range but like when he

[1:53:16]
kind of top of range but like when he
goes b75 on the river you kind of need
like you kind of need to beat ace8 for
this cuz I think pop and then check back
and the snap call you on river is like
rough like exactly A8 and then they have
a bunch of hero calls like the queen n

[1:53:30]
a bunch of hero calls like the queen n
hand is like my okay so yeah I look this
one up Queen n is just supposed to be a
pure call it's not supposed to ever rip
it in but whatever like it's not like
that big an EV mistake and is still
higher EV than folding to sh of Queen
n um so yeah like not too mad about that

[1:53:47]
n um so yeah like not too mad about that
uh so your your your intuition says that
uh he tanked a little bit but he already
knew he was calling yeah his head he was
already playing a different Ed said well
let's let let a little bit well I mean

[1:54:00]
let's let let a little bit well I mean
it's kind of it's kind of hard to say
because I I think this is the this is
like a super rare spot right like it's
there's a very specific Dynamic where
like you know a lot of the time you'll
have like a bunch of boats but you're
not supposed to slow play them um you're

[1:54:15]
not supposed to slow play them um you're
kind of because my range should be quite
polar but like this is like a specific
spot where I was like okay like the slow
play is you know a very big part of my
range like [ __ ] it we'll we'll like ship
it sometimes um yeah and I I I don't

[1:54:30]
it sometimes um yeah and I I I don't
imagine it's a spot where he had like
some specific exploit of like when Owen
checks back a p board and then shoves
the river he's full of [ __ ] like I don't
think we've done that you know you know
like that's way too specific um but yeah
I just went I I went for it and then um

[1:54:46]
I just went I I went for it and then um
yeah I mean I imagine he had to do some
thinging I like I imagine he had to work
himself also like sometimes m little
tank and then call you and he'll have
like like he'll have like a absurdly
snap cool hand I think he just likes to
think everything for um yeah like moon

[1:55:03]
think everything for um yeah like moon
is in tank and it's like is he trying to
like hero fold something or like you
know does he actually have a mixed
capture or am I actually you know like
what's going on like is this the one
where he goes [ __ ] you and rage calls me

[1:55:16]
where he goes [ __ ] you and rage calls me
um I think it does show that at least
you know you think about things that
things are not standard I think like at
Mid stes for example you will see way
more snap this snap that and at high for
example that was actually something that
I noticed when when commenting and Kevin

[1:55:30]
I noticed when when commenting and Kevin
was playing I mean there were things
that I thought were just 100% easy check
backs on the river and even there he was
sanking and thinking it through you know
so that seems like a characteris that
that munus also shared and that Kevin
was also sharing they they think through
spots quite uh quite R even though on

[1:55:46]
spots quite uh quite R even though on
first glance they seem like well this is
pretty standard right yeah I mean
especially like you know you have a spot
like this and if he calls it's going to
be a 200 big blind
pot like if you if you go oh my hand is

[1:56:01]
pot like if you if you go oh my hand is
zero EV I just have to mix that's kind
of you just like waving your hands and
going oh I couldn't find any edge here
and like sometimes that will be the case
but maybe he he knows okay this probably
a call but let let me see if I can find

[1:56:15]
a call but let let me see if I can find
an edge here yeah yeah I mean it also
you can just have your instinct of being
like okay I'll just call like half the
time or whatever but can I do better
than that and you have your entire time
bank to see if you can improve on that
and then if you can't you can fall back

[1:56:30]
and then if you can't you can fall back
on the RNG and it's like you know it's
not the end of the world if you even if
you end up falling back on the RNG most
of the time like a lot of these guys are
really good players and and so then it's
like okay well that's just what you're
you know it's what you're going to have
to do quite often but there you know if

[1:56:48]
to do quite often but there you know if
you find one time where you find a
really good reason not to
that can yeah that can generate a ton of
edge um and so like spending the time
just to check it like even if even if
you come away from it being like okay

[1:57:01]
you come away from it being like okay
well there was like there was nothing to
be had here like this you know this is
unfortunate I'm just going to have to
play like the what you going to lose
yeah yeah yeah yeah it doesn't cost you
anything it's not like um and also yeah
like the time banks are pretty like
faster planing um you should you could

[1:57:17]
faster planing um you should you could
leave the table to reset them as well I
mean it's it's like you know it's it's a
wreck Battle as it's like um if there's
like a fish at the table then your time
bank is kind of a limited resource right
because you can't like jump out and sit
back in to reset it um so that there but

[1:57:32]
back in to reset it um so that there but
like you know there's essentially no
opportunity cost to thinking for a hand
um yeah and like if if I you know if I'm
ever coaching people and I just see them
snapping their decisions constantly I'm
just like what like just play a little

[1:57:47]
just like what like just play a little
bit slower you'll be surprised how much
you notice it's like they're like oh I
could never notice this when I show them
saying it's like have you even tried
like you know you have like you have
like all this time on the early streets

[1:58:00]
like all this time on the early streets
as well to like pick up you know pick up
what's going on in the hand so that you
don't have to suddenly do it on the
river like I think a lot of times what I
see people do is they'll like Snap
through a hand and then they get into a
big river spot and now suddenly they
start replaying the hand and it's like

[1:58:17]
start replaying the hand and it's like
and and they're trying to go through it
like logically at this point but it's
like you should have been you should
have had most of this already done and
then you're just like putting the fin
like finishing touches on it or you know

[1:58:30]
like finishing touches on it or you know
like making some value judgment like you
should have all the factors like sort of
ready to go in your head by the time you
get to the big spot it's like you know
it's kind of what I was talking about
with the flushy hand where like you know
after I bet I started realizing getting

[1:58:45]
after I bet I started realizing getting
shoved on was a possibility and I was
already trying to work on what is my
response if he does shove on me so then
it know it wasn't a surprise when he did
obviously that was a case where like I
didn't have anywhere anything to go on
but um but yeah just like using the time

[1:59:00]
but um but yeah just like using the time
that's a lot to it's like you know if
someone said like a this is an exam
you're taking and you know you can
either have two hours or one hour for it
everyone just like I'll obviously take
the two hours but then like you know it
comes to Poker we're playing for real
money it's like okay yeah you can either

[1:59:16]
money it's like okay yeah you can either
Take 5 seconds or 15 seconds I'm not
saying like do this on every single
[ __ ] decision but sometimes there are
decisions which actually need like they
need a bit of and then on River it's
like you can take 20 seconds or you can
take 40 and like yeah I mean sometimes

[1:59:30]
take 40 and like yeah I mean sometimes
you'll just get to you'll get to 20
seconds in and you'll be like okay this
is clear or like even 10 seconds and
it'll be really obvious and that's no
big deal but like lots of them lots of
time it's like this can't have been
clear to you like there's there's enough
to work through so yeah I I I think like

[1:59:47]
to work through so yeah I I I think like
I mean there's probably not like every
single guy at the top but like lius is a
big tanker Dave's a big tank tanker like
Kevin we mentioned um like yeah I I like
him to take my time like ll's probably
the quickest of the lot of us but on
River he'll like sit there and like you

[2:00:02]
River he'll like sit there and like you
know like on River he'll sit there and
like really use his time um he was last
right yeah yeah that's true that true
maybe you should use a bit more time um
but yeah I think most of the like I I

[2:00:16]
but yeah I think most of the like I I
say big tankers it's not like we like
tanking simple decisions like so much is
automated but like when it gets
complicated with not going to I I mean
to some extent I think it's kind of pain
avoidance people are just like like the
the decision is causing them pain like

[2:00:31]
the decision is causing them pain like
it's very awkward for them to you know
to like it it's stressful for them to
work it out and they kind of just want
to bring that stress to an end like
that's not what they would say they're
doing but I think I think to some extent
that's you know part of that underlying

[2:00:45]
that's you know part of that underlying
motivation to act quickly like oh if
like if I just click call or I just
click fold I'll be out of this tough
spot and I'll be into another one where
I'm more confident about how to play it
um but you've got to sit with that
discomfort and then make the right
decision anyway uh yeah instead instead

[2:01:00]
decision anyway uh yeah instead instead
of just like yeah just running away from
running away from I think actually in
the sunny podcast I believe he actually
mentioned I think this exact thing that
always before a decision he always sort
of checks in emotionally in which state
he is and that's kind of what you're
describing if you're just rushing

[2:01:15]
describing if you're just rushing
because you're trying to get away from
an unpleasant feeling right then maybe
just first sit with the feeling like
okay just allow that feeling and then
think about the hand right but often
like I can I can definitely relate with
it I've definitely rushed your hands and
like what the [ __ ] just happened and
that was just me rushing through a

[2:01:31]
that was just me rushing through a
certain emotion that I didn't want that
I didn't want to be there right uh also
in terms of what you mentioned I guess
especially if on the Turner River
something happens that you know you it's
going to happen at a high frequency then
you know thinking about that on the Flop
that that Turner River scenario is going

[2:01:46]
that that Turner River scenario is going
to happen quite frequently maybe you
should have thought about that before
you stered the hand in that direction on
the Flop right it's like
how you're going to approach this spot
is going to determine some of the EV of
the line that you want to take on the
Flop um um I'm curious like I think it

[2:02:02]
Flop um um I'm curious like I think it
was a pretty big success so maybe we'll
have uh a world championship part two
how can you improve on this year's
performance uh yeah I think that were
yeah like I think come away from it with

[2:02:16]
yeah like I think come away from it with
the feeling that I played perfectly at
all um like there were definitely
like yeah like a lot a lot of the hands
which I would think of as not punts like
someone which I'm I'm think like okay
this hand was not that bad but um I kind

[2:02:34]
this hand was not that bad but um I kind
of made like I kind of made a reasonable
play where I had like you know I I I had
the info I had to to make to make a
different one and yeah it's just mostly

[2:02:46]
different one and yeah it's just mostly
just finally I was like pretty happy
with my mindset um and uh yeah Mo most
Bo team but yeah just like just like a
few things of um just like to like
toning down the like impulsiveness even

[2:03:00]
toning down the like impulsiveness even
like even more so
um yeah yeah I mean it's hard to say
what I would change because it's like
you know it's it's always easier to it's
always easier to pick out what you want
to change if you're on a down swing
right uh when you're on an upswing it's

[2:03:15]
right uh when you're on an upswing it's
just like no change nothing like just
keep it going like let's keep the
money yeah yeah um
in terms of how how you think the
challeng is set up or how the challenges
run any any because obviously you know
there was some uh urgency to it right I

[2:03:31]
there was some uh urgency to it right I
think it was GG removing high stakes and
suddenly all the high stakes guys had
nothing to do and they were like oh the
ideas of the shanon I remember already
in the air but I feel like they kind of
fast forwarded like okay let's launch it
let's go any any any things would you

[2:03:45]
let's go any any any things would you
like to see change in the next
championship or maybe you guys have
discussed that with the guys who have
been playing any
of
improvement so I I think that um I think
the challenge should like trim

[2:04:00]
the challenge should like trim
down uh in terms of the number of
players so as in like you can start with
the wide field and then just be like
after this like and it's like okay play
as many hands as you want whatever after
this date we will take like say the top
six players and they will play this many

[2:04:17]
six players and they will play this many
hands against each other and it'll be
like scheduled and they'll play like
we'll find a time which people can make
away might you know that might be
difficult with six players um so maybe
it would have to be less than that um
also yeah six Max tables are like i'

[2:04:31]
also yeah six Max tables are like i'
much prefer playing four Max or three
max so um maybe that's an improvement
four Max only [ __ ] EP and MP man just do
cut off B small by big night you have
you have all the scenarios no nit
positions nowhere to high between tight

[2:04:45]
positions nowhere to high between tight
ranges let's go yeah I mean like e is so
boring like
so dry it's just a cooler Fest did they
actually consider this or I remember
they they were listening quite a lot to
the players that some people pointed out
like hey was there a reason why so so we

[2:05:02]
like hey was there a reason why so so we
were talking about like so one thing
which got mentioned would be like
getting down to the last two doing a
heads up Showdown but obviously that's
quite different because like everyone
entered this as a six Max EG and like I
play a lot of heads up on the side so
obviously I'm down and I'm sure if it

[2:05:15]
obviously I'm down and I'm sure if it
had been like me versus lonus at the end
or like you know or by some miracle
llama been there then uh then they would
be like happy for like those guys would
be happy to just be like yeah we'll play
heads up at the at the end and put on a
bit of a spectacle that way but um but

[2:05:32]
bit of a spectacle that way but um but
yeah I mean like obviously Rick doesn't
want to like like he doesn't want to
suddenly like switch over to a game type
where like I've got a lot more
experience with him um but yeah I I
think having some sort of frander
Showdown because we were like talking

[2:05:45]
Showdown because we were like talking
about doing something like that but it
was like L was inferred and had kind of
phoned in the challenge I I I know
someone said he was like on holiday or
something and he'd had it like B and so
and also it was like we were like 20 or

[2:06:00]
and also it was like we were like 20 or
30 bans ahead and so it's like oh we
want to play three-handed with the top
three but like can you like you're just
asking someone to make up numbers at
that point it's like if it had been like
if it had been me like riged and Kevin

[2:06:15]
if it had been me like riged and Kevin
who were like playing down to the wire
and then we're all really close then
like us was being like okay we're going
to play like I know we're going to play
like 3,000 hands freehanded or something
to finish it off I think that would have
been quite like a cool way to do it
rather than um yeah I I I I feel like

[2:06:31]
rather than um yeah I I I I feel like
yeah the ending the ending could be
worked on a little bit and in terms of
length of time I was pretty happy with
you know three weeks and then a break
and then another two like towards the
end I was getting like kind of tired but
um yeah I feel like a feedback that that

[2:06:45]
um yeah I feel like a feedback that that
I've heard often is maybe shorten the
period a little bit they felt like six
to ask six weeks of or maybe know at
least have that stage where he said okay
everyone is welcome sort of and then we
play until top six that that's like the
first three weeks and then like this
okay let's play two days of six-handed

[2:07:01]
okay let's play two days of six-handed
then two days or four-handed two days
three-handed and then the the
competition is over right something yeah
I I think something that would be really
cool um just uh yeah Ju Just to like
round things out and it gives it yeah it
gives it a bit more spectacle to it

[2:07:17]
gives it a bit more spectacle to it
um but yeah I I mean like for me it was
like like for the first three weeks and
then like the one week after the break I
was feeling like pretty good like
towards the end of the three weeks I was
getting kind of tired but whatever um

[2:07:30]
getting kind of tired but whatever um
and then it was only the last week where
I was just like wow I'm having to like
I'm having to really play a lot less
just to like I would I would like play
one long day five tabling and then the
next day I just be like I just I'm just
not playing today um so so yeah I was

[2:07:47]
not playing today um so so yeah I was
like if I whereas before it was just
like I would push myself with days like
that but as long as they weren't like
common I wasn't getting too burn out I
do like you know I do them here and
there when I was feeling particularly
sharp but yeah it's what at the end I
was just say I played like a long

[2:08:00]
was just say I played like a long
session and then I was just like the
next day I was so out of it um so yeah I
I would make it like a little bit
shorter also you want to increase like
you know you you want to like the most
exciting times are when like like at
least in my opinion is when there's

[2:08:15]
least in my opinion is when there's
multiple contenders so the proportion of
the event where like there's lots of
people in contention is more
exciting cuz I think at least for like
the last like the last day wasn't
like it was a bit anticlimactic cuz like

[2:08:30]
like it was a bit anticlimactic cuz like
rigged went on like a 15 buing down
swing as I went on a 15 buing upswing or
saying at the end I so then the last day
was very much like you know uh it was
like it was just walking in um I mean
obviously you know you can't necessarily

[2:08:46]
obviously you know you can't necessarily
avoid that um sort of the nature of cash
games uh but yeah yeah I I think um I
think like making it a little bit
shorter CU like you know when people
were getting out to a lead and then it
was
like um like if someone's up to a 15 buy

[2:09:01]
like um like if someone's up to a 15 buy
lead early on that's still very
catchable for even the people who've
made no money like you know if you if
you just like sat there breaking even
like someone's 15 miles ahead of you
that's like you know that's like two
good sessions

[2:09:15]
good sessions
realistically um like not good sessions
two like amazing sessions but but still
um um whereas if you have like you know
once people start getting like 25 to 30
binds ahead of like not even just second
place like once someone's at like 300K

[2:09:32]
place like once someone's at like 300K
if you're at 50k it's like wow how
realistic is this really uh so I think
it can be a bit demotivating for people
to keep the high volume because at least
in the first week like the tables were
literally running Round the Clock yeah

[2:09:45]
literally running Round the Clock yeah
um there'd maybe be
like like two to 4 hour break top
in between like you know in between like
the EU sessions ending like the American
ones starting but like yeah the American

[2:10:01]
ones starting but like yeah the American
ones would would go late into the night
and then like you know lonus and Kevin
would come on at like I think it's like
1 or 2 A.M our time like uh you know we
just keep play I keep playing till like
4: or something then go off and like

[2:10:15]
4: or something then go off and like
wake up and Kevin's still playing uh
just like say hello to him like shift
change
um but uh yeah I I I feel like that was
at least for me the most exciting you
know well I I would imagine as a
spectator that would have been the most

[2:10:30]
spectator that would have been the most
exciting part um you know seeing topup
get off to an early lead and I guess you
know a bunch of people who following po
a lot more casually wouldn't have really
known topup and so then we just be like
oh wow like is this guy gonna be able to

[2:10:46]
oh wow like is this guy gonna be able to
like hold off the lead against lonus uh
I think that was like you know that was
very interesting to watch like even when
I wasn't like you know even when I was
like more in the chasing pack than like
right there at the top it was like quite

[2:11:00]
right there at the top it was like quite
you know it it was quite intriguing to
see like oh is lonus going to you know
is lonus going to catch him and then
like yeah I remember like lonus went on
like a massive downswing he was like two
BS behind top of and then suddenly he
was like break even the next day and
like yeah I thought that was like yeah I

[2:11:15]
like yeah I thought that was like yeah I
mean like the the long run is nice
actually declaring a king like the
longer you do it the more more valid the
results will be in that sense but I
think in the sense of like you know
putting on a spectacle and like saying
compelling to watch something a little
bit shorter would be a bit better in my

[2:11:31]
bit shorter would be a bit better in my
opinion yeah and and even still then
right the only way to really kind of
look at what you say who's who's the
best we just look at like the last three
years like like you said right Dave has
been you know crushing these games for
years with a very high win rate so it's

[2:11:46]
years with a very high win rate so it's
still obviously it's a reflection of at
that moment who's currently at the peak
uh right so we can make it six weeks but
you know it will like maybe if you make
it a year it will actually become become
like truly you know we can really re

[2:12:01]
like truly you know we can really re
really establish that but you know I
think I think if you do four weeks or
six weeks you know it's not really going
to make uh make a huge difference as the
champion now right you have a lot of
people looking up to you wanting to be
like you uh what advice would you give

[2:12:16]
like you uh what advice would you give
to low and midak players who dream of
competing in the next World Championship
and maybe even uh winning how how how
how can they beat you that's basically
what they want to know what do they have
to
do yeah uh I mean start now I would say

[2:12:34]
do yeah uh I mean start now I would say
I'd say one of the main mistakes I see
people make is like is actually asking
people like me what the work is they
need to do because um I get so like on

[2:12:45]
need to do because um I get so like on
the stream I see so many people ask this
and like they all think they're like you
know obviously they haven't heard the
answer a million times so hopefully this
gets it all out there right hopefully
this reaches a wide enough audience um
but I think a lot of people want to know

[2:13:01]
but I think a lot of people want to know
like the secret recipe for
improving but I only know what works for
me um and I think what people need to
embrace is just going out there and
trying a bunch of different ways of

[2:13:16]
trying a bunch of different ways of
learning and then learning how you learn
and then once you know know what works
for you you can then get more invested
in that particular way of learning
rather than like a lot of times people
would just be like oh oh and how did you
study and I just like well you know I

[2:13:32]
study and I just like well you know I
did like you know I did like tons of
in-depth like hand reviews where I'll
just look at like you know one specific
hand go like really deep into the
Dynamics of it you know someone brings
up a spreadsheet in front of me like I
run away and fear um so yeah I'm not

[2:13:46]
run away and fear um so yeah I'm not
really big on the AG reports and all
that but it's like You' got to you got
to try a bunch of stuff
like see what is having a tangible
impact on your win rate like what is
sticking in your brain what do you feel
like you're using in sessions and you're
just like the more stuff you try the

[2:14:00]
just like the more stuff you try the
more you will notice that these are the
things which are actually helping me um
as I think loads of people they want to
like they want to know what work to do
before they do it but it's more like do
a bunch of work and then you will know

[2:14:15]
a bunch of work and then you will know
which one which things to continue doing
like the time isn't wasted if if you try
something
and then it doesn't actually add
anything that feels like it's wasted
time like if someone's done 100 total
hours of study in their life and then

[2:14:30]
hours of study in their life and then
they spend 5 hours work you know saying
it feels so significant but like really
you spent those five hours learning that
this isn't how you learn um and it will
just you know it will just fade out like
as the time goes by this will become
like a very small part of your like

[2:14:46]
like a very small part of your like
small but necessary part of your
journey uh yeah to to just eliminate
yeah to to eliminate all all the things
which aren't working um yeah like I mean
when when I was learning HS up I just
played like millions of pounds against

[2:15:00]
played like millions of pounds against
the trainer uh and I was just like kind
of just you know getting Corrections and
just like thinking about like okay why
did I get this wrong and all this stuff
and like just developing intuition like
that but there are some people who
playing as the trainer just doesn't
stick for them I think they're like not

[2:15:15]
stick for them I think they're like not
critical enough about it they kind of
like you know they kind of Click through
the hands very like and like not um you
know they're not as engaged as they need
to be in order to think about why it's
gone wrong and like you can still make

[2:15:30]
gone wrong and like you can still make
tons of improvements even if you're not
the person who learns really well from
trainer like it's not like it's not
necessary that you follow the same path
as someone else um but yeah I just yeah
just say go go out there and try a bunch
of
[ __ ] for you future you know and we see

[2:15:47]
[ __ ] for you future you know and we see
often you know in various Sports and uh
and other competitive environment you
have someone at the top and then at some
point they fade away or they quit well
luckily in poker you know you don't have
like a physical limitation like in for

[2:16:00]
like a physical limitation like in for
example tennis football or whatever
where at some point you know you're just
too old uh that's probably not going to
happen so how do you plan on staying on
the top and you know how does kind of
the future for poker look like for you
you've been dabling a lot of heads up is

[2:16:16]
you've been dabling a lot of heads up is
that something that you want to pursue
more I heard you briefly mentioned mtts
as well maybe like
you know where where's the future going
for ow yeah um I mean I'm kind of well I
still have a bunch of free time now this

[2:16:31]
still have a bunch of free time now this
challenge is over um I'm going to I'm
probably just going
to like I'm probably going to play some
heads up for a bit there's some people
that want the smoke so you know we're
going to have to go going to have to go
fight see who comes out on top um see
how far I can push that uh yeah I mean

[2:16:48]
how far I can push that uh yeah I mean
I'm probably going to have to make it to
a Triton at some point like you know
what what am I doing not going to
unrealistically and that yeah that that
that'll be exciting I'm not really much
for long-term planner though um it's

[2:17:02]
for long-term planner though um it's
funny actually you're saying about like
staying on top of your game uh I sort of
realized after the challenge like I
could see how people get washed up
because I was like I was feeling so
confident in my like you know feel for

[2:17:15]
confident in my like you know feel for
how things are going and like as I said
I kind of swore off solvers a bit I was
like oh this is what happens you get to
a point you're so confident in like your
feel for the game that it's just like ah
like what's even the point of studying
now I just got to like I just got to
stay sharp and like lock in and then and

[2:17:31]
stay sharp and like lock in and then and
then like you know it's like I got a
brief glimpse into my future I was like
oh yeah like a few years down the line
this will this will come back to bite me
if I didn't do any periods of studying
like what you know I should probably get
to it eventually um but yeah for for for

[2:17:46]
to it eventually um but yeah for for for
now all good you usually also what it
takes is a downswing to kick you into
shade but I don't know if that's it for
you but like you lose a bit of money and
it's like okay right back to back to the
Sims um for sure yeah Adam any uh any
final questions you would like Owen

[2:18:01]
final questions you would like Owen
before we uh we let him go no I think we
covered the journey quite well there so
I just want to congratulate you one for
a amazing series of tournament
championships I know the last
conversation we had it was a kind of
dream of yours to be number one and
you've got that top of the hill at least

[2:18:15]
you've got that top of the hill at least
for this brief moment in time so great
job on that and yeah we thank you for
coming on to share your journey
great conversation thanks again ow for
coming on second time actually the first
guest that came on twice on our podcast

[2:18:30]
guest that came on twice on our podcast
Adam any main takeaways of our
conversation we have with
Owen yeah quite a few I found his
mindset coming into the challenge very
interesting I thought we talked about
treating everyone like a heads up
opponent almost like 20 heads up battles

[2:18:45]
opponent almost like 20 heads up battles
at once he mentioned almost having this
Predator mindset of wanting to win want
to go to war and really trying to treat
every opponent as an individual and
where he can exploit those I'm sure
anyone listening could see or as a
confident guy he backs himself but he

[2:19:00]
confident guy he backs himself but he
also backs it up with the work he puts
in it feels like for him to go out on
top of this challenge one he really
wanted it and he put the intensity in
but also he seemed to have a slightly
different approach to many six Max
regulars who probably had a more
holistic approach of how to play the
pool where he was like attack everyone

[2:19:15]
pool where he was like attack everyone
go at everyone and really triy to create
um Carnage in the player pool He also
mentioned how he how he remembers how to
play against players he kind of creates
a say a character of them how they look
he mentioned like easy what your friends
do because you know their character

[2:19:30]
do because you know their character
traits their attitudes and he's all
always stress testing how are they
thinking he's trying to think what they
would think and then basically put them
in different scenarios I also liked how
he talked about testing people he
mentioned this in the first podcast as
well which I liked he's always like
probing people and and going right do

[2:19:45]
probing people and and going right do
you know the exploit for this do you
know I'm getting you here if you don't
I'm just going to keep attacking you if
you do awesome we can move on to the
next game and if not and even mentioned
getting bored at times because people
weren't keeping up he's like come on I'm
getting you here come we go the next
level all right cool I'll just Bor and

[2:20:00]
level all right cool I'll just Bor and
take your money off you in this
department if that's that's the case I
like his competitive drive as well which
you talked about he's he wanted to win
like this is the thing he signed up he's
like I want to win he mentions I wanted
to show people how good I am people
underestimate me I want to show them I'm
I'm a top guy so yeah so many things

[2:20:15]
I'm a top guy so yeah so many things
that I felt came to a nice conclusion
this this whole challenge for him based
on the his conversation a year and a
half away ago and then just one final
thing how he handles pressure he
mentions he loves it and he thrives
under any sort of pressure so you put

[2:20:32]
under any sort of pressure so you put
him in a high stakes environment like
this against the best players in the
world he doesn't really need routine he
doesn't really need much
performance habits it's just show up
give me tough opponents and I'm locked
in and that's uh you see this with Som
High performers who just the pressure of

[2:20:46]
High performers who just the pressure of
competition is enough to lock them in he
mentioned playing chess as a youngster
that kind of trained him to to handle
nerves handle adrenaline handle pressure
and now he just put him in the big games
and he can perform well which see this
format really really well and yeah

[2:21:00]
format really really well and yeah
really pleased that he did did so well
how about you yourself R what was the
the main takeaways I actually want to
add something to that like was not that
he didn't really prepare because he did
he does really know himself pretty well
right it's more based on feeling he kind
of sees how he feels I think he manages

[2:21:16]
of sees how he feels I think he manages
himself pretty well and he he's trying
to make sure that the volume that he
does put in is aame volume like also if
you look at the amount of hands played
in The Challenge he was probably average
in in volume not a very high volume not
very low volume um which I think was

[2:21:30]
very low volume um which I think was
kind of more sty right he said he plays
three tables he was always on lookout
for more information um actually uh a
quote of sunu Art of War that came to my
mind the battle is one before it fought
is a very big one of him and that's kind
of where the preparation came in right
he already knew uh the strategy that was

[2:21:47]
he already knew uh the strategy that was
going to work against these players
right and it was very individual so the
preparation is kind of the battle is one
before it's fought and then when he came
in all he had to do was execute and
that's then also in the beginning I
think he said the first five days you

[2:22:00]
think he said the first five days you
know he didn't really get off to the
start that he wanted but he did see that
the plan that he had was actually
working so despite the actual result
maybe not coming his way he was very
confident because he saw that what he
planned out to do the plan was working
right he just needed to catch some heat

[2:22:15]
right he just needed to catch some heat
uh as he was saying um he uh I think he
he mentioned do you know how to deal
with this I really like that one and he
said listen this is a little frequency
play but until you show me that you know
how to deal with this I'm going to up
the frequency a little bit or lower the

[2:22:31]
the frequency a little bit or lower the
frequency a little bit based on you know
what what what what what you what kind
of the evidence that you give me um
always be on the lookout for more I
think that was definitely also something
that a lot of players just show up and
play their game and people think that

[2:22:46]
play their game and people think that
you know they should do all the work
before they start playing you know and
just we just got right preparation is
important go in with your strategy but
then people are like okay now I'm just
grinding but for him this was just the
beginning right you sit down you're
going to play and now you're going to
look for more what more adjustments can

[2:23:01]
look for more what more adjustments can
I make how can I make even more money at
this table for him this is only where
the game begins it's just like his
Baseline preparation that he does but
from there the game begins uh and the
last point that I wrote out uh that I
wrote down that he really wanted the the
every everyone to hear uh that there's

[2:23:16]
every everyone to hear uh that there's
no one way to get there right that's the
everyone always wants to know how did
you get there what should I do and he
said like yeah find out what works for
you he he mentioned that especially in
heads up he played lot against the
trainer worked lot for him uh in six Max

[2:23:30]
trainer worked lot for him uh in six Max
he would go very deep into specific
hands and handies and that's kind of how
he learned but he said it can be
different for other people right and in
poker there's many ways you can improve
and people have different approaches and
he said listen just put some time and
effort into one approach and reflect and

[2:23:45]
effort into one approach and reflect and
see if this is the best for you and then
switch to a different approach that
maybe works better for you so so uh yeah
