[00:00]
back back then when I was taking shots I
I really didn't care who I'm playing am
I playing six Max or heads up I didn't
care I just played and lost my half of
my bank r at at the head of match today
we will be chatting with Finnish High

[00:15]
we will be chatting with Finnish High
six cash game player Samu Alto Samu was
a former professional Counterstrike
player and has been playing professional
online poker for over 15 years I've
played video games my whole life I like
to test things with people like in

[00:31]
to test things with people like in
Counter Strike you you go with the one
strategy and see what happens and then
you exploit in the next round and poker
is close to CS when you think about that
in these 15 years he has seen and
survived it all as he managed to stay

[00:46]
survived it all as he managed to stay
profitable and more recently rised up to
become one of the bigger winners at high
stakes it it wasn't smart at all back
then I mean my strategy was basically
like when I couldn't call blind versus
blind situation I three B like 40% and I

[01:02]
blind situation I three B like 40% and I
defend 60% of my hands basically and
every time when they check I stab 100%
and it worked back then would you say
that in the beginning of trying to use
solvers your game took a step backwards
no no I actually got worse when I

[01:17]
no no I actually got worse when I
started to use solers any bad habits
yeah I play too many tables and too many
hours
so I I I mean I can play like thir 30
hours straight without any breaks when

[01:31]
hours straight without any breaks when
you play 10,000 T in a one session like
you are you are not playing that good
yeah I was curious you mentioned that
with Counter Strike you uh you were
doing a lot of traveling but when I

[01:45]
doing a lot of traveling but when I
looked up on your hand the up I saw
basically no no caches whatsoever uh do
have you one cash one cash okay sorry
don't want to month ago month ago don't
want to take away this uh this glorious
moment

[02:03]
all right there he is Samu thank you for
coming on the podcast thank you for
having me Samu last couple of podcasts
we did we have been chatting with guys

[02:15]
we did we have been chatting with guys
that are uh I would say New Kids on the
Block you know they had only been
playing poker for three years like young
whis kids it's good to see a fellow old
school player still in the mix at high
stakes after I think 15 years you've
been playing poker correct

[02:30]
been playing poker correct
yeah professionally for uh 15 years but
I think I started 16 years ago so yeah
it's a long long journey yeah indeed I
wanted to start the pot off with getting
some insights about how poker has

[02:47]
some insights about how poker has
evolved over the years because some
people who are listening you know they
they didn't even know anything about
poker when you started to play poker
professionally so could you maybe share
with us how it was to be a professional

[03:00]
with us how it was to be a professional
online poker player back in the days and
then compare it to what it means to be
one nowadays how has the the job
description of a professional poker
player
changed oh man where where do I start um

[03:15]
changed oh man where where do I start um
I mean well we didn't have any pre flop
ranges back then obviously we just had
to try and see what happens basically
and yeah after many hands I kind of

[03:30]
and yeah after many hands I kind of
figured it out and yeah I don't know
well maybe I was lucky back then of
course but I don't know that's that was
like a video game for me back then like
I enjoyed playing too much and I was

[03:46]
I enjoyed playing too much and I was
obsessed like crazy so I don't know how
did you go about like strategy for
example what does uh what do trying to
get better look like was it just playing
and reevaluating or were you doing some
stuff up table I remember back in the

[04:00]
stuff up table I remember back in the
days there were some stuff available I
think card cart Runners EV for example I
think was available if I'm not mistaken
flopzilla these type of
programs yeah I I didn't use any of
those softwares back then I I watched

[04:15]
those softwares back then I I watched
some uh videos from car runers or Lego
poker was back
then but I didn't have any softwares at
all like I watched a couple of videos
just only

[04:31]
just only
end yeah that's what it for me when uh
when pref ranges did come out how close
how how far off were we do do you
recall
uh I don't know maybe they came before I

[04:48]
uh I don't know maybe they came before I
even knew they they were existing
because I I saw them first time like
maybe 8 years ago or something but I I'm
sure they came up much earlier I

[05:01]
sure they came up much earlier I
think were you um more of a lone wolf
when you started or did you have like a
group around you with some people that
were also playing poker that you could
chat strategy with for example if I talk
for myself back then the main way you

[05:15]
for myself back then the main way you
would improve is to kind of yeah discuss
with other players and see what they
think because you know nowadays we have
maybe like an optimal example like in a
solver and kind of work our way
backwards but back then you know it was
the Wild Wild West
yeah I I didn't have any any friends

[05:32]
yeah I I didn't have any any friends
actually who played poker seriously I of
course my friends were playing but for
fun basically all the time like I was
only one who tried to win something and

[05:45]
only one who tried to win something and
tried to make some sense for poker back
then it sounds funny when I say that
nowadays because it was
so it it wasn't smart at all back then
what wasn't smart to to to to pursue

[06:01]
what wasn't smart to to to to pursue
poker uh sorry what wasn't smart back
then to pursue poker or the way I mean
my I mean my strategy was basically like
when I couldn't call blind versus blind
situation I three like 40% and I defend

[06:18]
situation I three like 40% and I defend
60% of my hands basically and every time
when they check I stab 100% for example
and it worked back
then I mean it seems Seems like a very
good adjust M back then right because I

[06:31]
good adjust M back then right because I
think the natural tendency of humans and
still is today you know that we lean
towards the passive side but imagine 15
years ago so I imagine that strategy was
definitely crushing I can definitely
relate to what you said post flop I
never tried a 6040 uh strategy bigger or

[06:46]
never tried a 6040 uh strategy bigger or
smaller but it's uh you know I would
have definitely been on board but
definitely yeah like B basically when
people looked weak they were weak right
nowadays it's a bit Yeah hidden I guess
right people kind of H people are more
people are more balanced nowadays but

[07:00]
people are more balanced nowadays but
back then it was it wasn't balanced back
then like my friend said actually funny
sentence because he said like uh every
time you are post flop just rep you have
a set like every time and people people

[07:18]
a set like every time and people people
folded like 95% of the time sometimes
they had to it
but I remember like uh I would you would
call you know someone opened you would
call force it suited because you know
know yeah there were no pref up ranges

[07:31]
know yeah there were no pref up ranges
and as soon as you hit the if you hit a
four it was basically a set you would
always play call race all in that was
that was just a lie people were just SE
betting and then they always had over
paars but when you go call Race yeah you
always have a set and no ever [ __ ]

[07:45]
always have a set and no ever [ __ ]
turn AAR to a bluff so that was like 15
years ago yeah I remember 14 years ago
or something uh it might sound pretty
Maniac style but it actually worked back
then it did it did

[08:00]
then it did it did
uh until at some point uh you know it
didn't it didn't anymore of course uh
you said you were playing poker with
your friends and you were basically the
only one that kind of of those pursued
it uh to take it a little bit more
serious why or when did you realize like

[08:17]
serious why or when did you realize like
hey wait this is like a skillful game
and I can actually start to make a lot
of money uh if I take this
serious it was actually the first time
when I played poker I mean we were at se

[08:30]
when I played poker I mean we were at se
I think it was 2006 or something and we
were uh actually playing Counter
Strike uh in the US and we were really
bored at at our hotel room and we didn't

[08:46]
bored at at our hotel room and we didn't
have any smartphones or iPads back then
so we had to figure out something to do
and some some
guy both po poer chips and cards and we
just hey what what is this game and

[09:00]
just hey what what is this game and
let's play and I I
pretty fast noticed like there's a skill
aspect as well like of course it's a it
was pretty pretty luck heavy game back
then but I no this there is a skill

[09:16]
then but I no this there is a skill
definitely behind
that how did you then
uh what what made you realize do do
maybe something stands out they like hey
wait there's skill involved and how did
you start uh implementing the skills for

[09:31]
you start uh implementing the skills for
example I I I remember learning that I
would raise someone in position just to
make him shut down so I could check
behind the turn and get a free River I
think think it was called the free play
if I'm not mistaken right and this was
like I remember I implemented it and it

[09:46]
like I remember I implemented it and it
worked I was like Wow sick I do this
then you do that wow that's sick yeah I
mean because no one wasn't forit
bluffing like well of course not the
first live game but I mean online first

[10:01]
first live game but I mean online first
years so I could basically three betet
every time like because I never got
fored
like yeah basically the same what what
you said but it was pretty simple back

[10:16]
you said but it was pretty simple back
then yeah it was just uh hey if I do a
you do B okay I I'll keep on doing a
nowadays you know you have to you have
to go down the whole alphabet to to
finally figure out your your strategy oh
you you have

[10:30]
you you have
in poker for over 15 years which is
obviously very impressive and definitely
something to be proud of longevity then
is a skill that stands out to me uh it's
one of the most important skills for
poker success and you have clearly
mastered that could you maybe share with

[10:45]
mastered that could you maybe share with
us um some of the most important skills
for um or trads that you have developed
that have enabled you to sustain success
in poker over such a long period of time

[11:00]
in poker over such a long period of time
yeah I mean you have
to learn your game like well every year
at least if not every week like you have
to take your game to the next level
like I mean you can't you can't play

[11:15]
like I mean you can't you can't play
your old game and be confident with with
that like you have to evolve when when a
new new school GS evil like they learn
the game like they are super super good
nowadays and you have to just keep
learning

[11:30]
learning
yourself did you learn this uh was it
was it like common sense to you or did
you have to learn this the hard way were
you maybe was there maybe a time that SS
out to you that you were maybe a bit
stubborn with your strategy not not
accepting that maybe you should change

[11:45]
accepting that maybe you should change
something and move on yeah I was I was
fighting many years against solvers and
stuff like I was like the old school guy
like I don't need any solvers I can
figure it out myself but

[12:00]
figure it out myself but
uh after my results got worse like I had
to do something and yeah so I started
with my P
solver practice after
that how did the so the introduction of

[12:17]
that how did the so the introduction of
solvers in the beginning you were a
little bit skeptical from from what I'm
understanding I mean I like I said I
went through the same pH I was also like
this you know what do you mean like know
that common resp but like yeah but yeah

[12:30]
that common resp but like yeah but yeah
my nobody plays perfect so why why would
I play Perfect this is not what's going
on blah blah blah exactly um how how did
that then both negatively and positively
impact your game when you did at some
point decide to to use

[12:46]
point decide to to use
solvers
well I mean you have to not not look
when you use the solvers
like uh that's the secret behind that
like I used it uh like two years without

[13:00]
like I used it uh like two years without
not loocks and I was like I don't I
don't understand these goals because I'm
playing uh with the guys who are not
that good
like 200 NL or 500 NL like there's no

[13:15]
like 200 NL or 500 NL like there's no
point of of having even a solver when
you are playing those Stakes uh like
five years ago so I I didn't I didn't
see any reason to use those would you
said it in the beginning of trying to
use solvers your game game took a step

[13:30]
use solvers your game game took a step
backward or do you straight away knew
kind of what to do with this
knowledge uh no no I actually got worse
when I started to use solvers but uh
slowly I I kind of learned how to how to

[13:46]
slowly I I kind of learned how to how to
use that correctly like like maybe all
of us are using the solvers wrong with
the wrong style I mean you if you
know yeah I mean I have I have I have my
fair share of experience of Mis misusing

[14:02]
fair share of experience of Mis misusing
misinterpret tating misapplying uh
misapplying solvers it's definitely a
skill that you develop over the years
does any does any moment stand out to
you that you are like ah this is what

[14:16]
you that you are like ah this is what
I've been doing
wrong um I can't
remember
uh uh I'm not really sure like

[14:30]
uh uh I'm not really sure like
first when I started to use solers I I
was like calling like solver does and
people people are not finding enough
Buffs like maybe in every spot so I was
like why I'm losing I'm calling every

[14:47]
like why I'm losing I'm calling every
I'm playing so
GTO like I can't lose why I'm losing I I
kind of didn't understand that at
first did you intuitively feel like
something wrong because for example the

[15:00]
something wrong because for example the
strategies that you mentioned that you
came up with in the beginning of your
career they came from a very good
intuitive understanding of like oh you
do a I do B and kind of a solver seemed
to have kind of replaced that skill for
you and or kind of that skill had been
forgotten yeah I got I got super Rusty

[15:17]
forgotten yeah I got I got super Rusty
with
my uh own own game uh after after my
solver experiment
like uh when I got filed to solvers I I

[15:30]
like uh when I got filed to solvers I I
tried to go back to my old style and I
notic this people got got super super
good uh in in that time machine
so I was like kind of lost to be honest

[15:45]
so I was like kind of lost to be honest
after
that and yeah what happened uh that made
you I mean you're current you're
currently uh playing the high stakes
doing very well so it's some point you
you found your path right what

[16:02]
you found your path right what
happened uh well uh I had to have a
actually I contact to Patrick Howard
back back then like uh two years ago and

[16:16]
back back then like uh two years ago and
we started I started to work work with
Patrick and yeah things things got so uh
better after
that or like some of the

[16:30]
that or like some of the
the
main sort of aha moments when you
started to work to be together with
Patrick in this
case um I mean
he's he's good at

[16:45]
he's he's good at
explaining like why why solver is doing
that and those things for example like
well H hard hard to come up with any
examples but

[17:00]
examples but
well it helped helped me super much like
because I was so lost with the
solver how for example you're clearly
you know because you started you you've
you've been playing for so long how

[17:15]
you've been playing for so long how
would you
say how much of your let's say old game
and your initial
skills do you now are able to be put on
the table in your strategy as alongside
with the solver knowledge

[17:30]
uh yeah I I still
play uh it's kind of mixed nowadays I
play with my all style and I try to play
GTO in some spots but I still have my
old style behind that like it's a mix

[17:48]
old style behind that like it's a mix
basically my my own playing style
nowadays what are like some some of the
positive things that give you maybe an

[18:00]
positive things that give you maybe an
asch over like these more new school
kids um because of the fact that you've
been playing so long or do you don't
think it has any
advantages um um I'm not sure maybe I'm

[18:15]
advantages um um I'm not sure maybe I'm
pretty good at controlling tilt like I
don't tilt like ever and I can see from
some new players like they
are kind of swingy with them their

[18:30]
are kind of swingy with them their
mood and I don't
know there might might be
something it's because of playing that
much I feel like uh older school players
because we rose up in a time where we

[18:46]
because we rose up in a time where we
didn't have Perfect Solutions and we
weren't thinking about playing perfect
Balan strategies all we were trying to
do is figure out what the [ __ ] our
opponent has and what they're up to and
try to you know adjust from that and I
feel like a bit more new skit especially
if you use the solver a bit wrong you

[19:01]
if you use the solver a bit wrong you
can be really in your hat and only look
at your own strategy your own cards and
try to play Perfect do you feel like
that's something that like that train of
thought of at least trying to make sense
of what your opponent's doing what's

[19:15]
of what your opponent's doing what's
actually going on the table you think
that's the skill that uh can give you an
asch
nowadays sorry I can hear a bit so for
example nowadays in in solver in the
solver in the solver l people are very
much focused on their own strategy

[19:30]
much focused on their own strategy
trying to play good whereas in the old
school you know we had to figure it out
so we're mainly trying to figure out
well is our opponent like you were
saying for example I was calling GTO but
intuitively I knew people were not
bluffing in this spot which is a skill
you know that you that was very valuable

[19:45]
you know that you that was very valuable
in the past because we were just trying
to figure out what our opponents was up
to right that's why you were stepping
100% when they checked yeah yeah yeah I
mean I mean that's a good good
experience to have behind that because

[20:00]
experience to have behind that because
like it just proves you you were wrong
uh I mean you were right back back then
like it it likes uh it like conf
confirms your thought 15 years
ago does it now that you understand the

[20:17]
ago does it now that you understand the
Lo the logic behind sers a bit better do
you now feel like you came full circle
and now you also understand why
everything You' done in the 15 years you
know at the Times where you had a good
strategy it was working you now
understand why it's working and you
might now also be better to Able

[20:30]
might now also be better to Able
understand in which situation that would
still apply in which situation it
doesn't and kind of adapt so you
basically what what probably would would
have happened with you is now you're
able to play more solid when the
situation requires and play more your

[20:45]
situation requires and play more your
old style when the situation allows you
to yeah exactly I think that's the
pretty good skill to have
nowadays like it's really helpful
any bad habits that you've picked up

[21:01]
any bad habits that you've picked up
along the last 15 years that you have
trouble getting rid
of yeah I play too many tables and too
many hours
so I I I mean I can play like 30 30

[21:16]
so I I I mean I can play like 30 30
hours straight without any breaks
basically and I'm the last person who
who leaves the tables like 8 a.m. like I
play I start
evening and I stopped at like morning

[21:34]
evening and I stopped at like morning
basically you it's funny because you
answer this is sort of a bad thing but I
can understand that this also has
brought a lot of positive things in your
career yeah I mean when you play 10,000

[21:47]
career yeah I mean when you play 10,000
hands in a one session like you are you
are not playing that good in some points
like you're I mean your quality
is super bad when you stop your session

[22:03]
is super bad when you stop your session
so I I try to fix that habit but but
yeah so how how do you go about trying
to fix fix out this bad
habit what kind of you're trying to do

[22:15]
habit what kind of you're trying to do
I'm sure there's some people listening
like oh [ __ ] yeah I I set the set set an
intention I'm going to play four hours
I'm going to focus on this focus on that
before I know a 24 hours flew by and
nothing that I was trying to apply I've
actually applied I mean I I've always
played like any limits basically like

[22:32]
played like any limits basically like
nowadays even but I recently stopped
playing the smaller Stak so my I I don't
have that many tables anymore so and
it's easier to quit earlier when you

[22:45]
it's easier to quit earlier when you
notice you are playing your b game when
you have like four tables instead of
having 12
tables how has your decision- making
changed now that you've only had four
tables to think about do you notice that

[23:00]
tables to think about do you notice that
you're starting to see things that you
didn't see before how has that have what
kind of impact does has this had on uh
on your on your play yeah definitely it
helped helped my game so much
obviously but when I was younger it felt

[23:16]
obviously but when I was younger it felt
boring when you have only four tables
but when I look back like I've always
played my best game when I play only
like four to six tables

[23:31]
over the 15 years obviously a lot of
you've you've seen a lot of uh Trends
come and go meta come and go uh what is
like a specific meta in like poker that
stands out to you in the last 15 years
you obviously started with uh three

[23:46]
you obviously started with uh three
betting 100% because people weren't four
betting basically uh what type of type
of me stand out to you over the
years yeah I mean and when I started I
three beted like 100 % and Steet also

[24:01]
three beted like 100 % and Steet also
100% with 75 sizing and people were
falling 75 times 75% of the time so uh
yeah I remember the time when I played
one year only B Limit Omaha and when I

[24:18]
one year only B Limit Omaha and when I
go went went back to No Limit Holdem
there there were a guy lusl who see it
with the third B size
on the Flop and I was like what is what

[24:31]
on the Flop and I was like what is what
is this what is what is going on and
maybe one year later everyone was doing
that
so yeah I remember that time yeah that
was a very big uh big switch when uh

[24:45]
was a very big uh big switch when uh
when like this the small C betting for
new school players they're like what
what do you mean were you only like King
seven D's rainbow here three quarters
let's go and that was I remember back
then I was like well and I will do this
with my and I would do all also this
with my Bluffs so I would open bet 75%

[25:02]
with my Bluffs so I would open bet 75%
with both my value both my Bluffs
because then I'm balance you know that
was like the first idea that that came
into my head that had anything to do
with
balance and I have to say when you when
you check back you are you are capped

[25:16]
you check back you are you are capped
after that you can't check back you have
to see that every time yeah exactly so
you know because you're going to see
that your value so you should also see B
your bluff because else you know it's
it's it's unbalanced
makes very very exploitable strategy now

[25:30]
makes very very exploitable strategy now
that I think about it what what what do
what do you say is the the current meta
nowadays in online
poker um I think
everyone is playing pretty good

[25:45]
everyone is playing pretty good
like I I can't really say anything like
uh but is the meta of the game right
now I mean it feels like everyone are
drilling with the GTO Wizard and you are

[26:02]
drilling with the GTO Wizard and you are
playing against bots but of course there
is a value in the game but but hard to
say what is the I don't
know it's a tough

[26:15]
know it's a tough
question I saw you you were limping a
few days ago on on a YouTube video so
maybe that's the that's the upcoming
meta is that the new meta is that the
new meta I mean you know you you're
referring to you refer to the coin poker
game I mean it's also because we're

[26:31]
game I mean it's also because we're
playing 0.2 big blind ant and I was with
uh the fish of my direct left so I mean
it's either you know I'm gonna knit it
up or obviously knitting it up is no fun
when you're on stream uh so yeah then I

[26:47]
when you're on stream uh so yeah then I
was like well I want I want I want to be
in there so limping it is that's uh
that's kind of how it went
yeah you saw you saw s Li in the seven d
reased and no no no I I didn't watch

[27:02]
reased and no no no I I didn't watch
that
video was a good game uh next time maybe
I'll I'll I'll take that seat again uh
just so I can start limping again it's
fun do you ever Lim there's definitely

[27:15]
fun do you ever Lim there's definitely
some situations in non normal games
where I adapt to a limping strategy as
well here and there you like
limping no no never never done that
never done that I mean you know you were
trying uh wait wait wait actually I I

[27:31]
trying uh wait wait wait actually I I
had a time when I had a limping strategy
from small blind but maybe it was one
year or
something so I don't have anymore all
right no not not not in the limping camp

[27:45]
right no not not not in the limping camp
we we're talking a little bit about the
like kind of the old school let's call
it more exploitative thinking and like
the introduction of solvers more
theoretically correct thinking
how do you navigate the balance between

[28:01]
how do you navigate the balance between
implementing like the solver wisdom
while staying on the lookout for
exploits uh and looking at your opponent
Tendencies as it's very easy to get
caught up thinking what the solver would
do all the time how do you kind of find
that balance how have you found the

[28:15]
that balance how have you found the
nowadays it seems like that was
something that you were struggling
with uh I mean
I I I take notes from people like like a
crazy crazy person like I I have
hundreds of colors at my poker star for

[28:33]
hundreds of colors at my poker star for
example like because uh nowadays people
doesn't label players like you know some
re doeses that and you know and but but
I still make the notes and try to figure

[28:49]
I still make the notes and try to figure
out what is people like doing and
maybe come come up with the
GTO uh
against some players but some against

[29:02]
against some players but some against
some players I'm
playing uh with exploitive strategy like
um if if I know they are not doing any G
work with with themselves

[29:15]
work with with themselves
so yeah this is kind of something I see
with new school players they either they
don't make any notes they don't tag
anyone because you know I'm here to I'm
here to apply my strategy right or they
say yeah this is a wck I'm like okay
yeah what kind of we're talking about
you know is he on like FY side is he a

[29:31]
you know is he on like FY side is he a
bit more aggressive you know does he
throw out a little banana play here and
there you know you know what are we're
up to and the same with the fish this
guy's a fish yeah okay more like a whale
is he aggressive is he passive you know
what yeah exactly exactly showdowns have

[29:46]
what yeah exactly exactly showdowns have
you seen what do you mean showdowns they
say I don't look at show yeah and for
example when I bet 50% against them they
they go crazy and when I go full bot
they just check call every time for
example or when I plock bet they mostly

[30:03]
example or when I plock bet they mostly
calls or or something when I try to
induce them I I go half B every time for
that's an example what what I do with my
game yeah it sounds like the the I Inu

[30:15]
game yeah it sounds like the the I Inu
unj I I use like call it try a little
one to to Inu some action and and when I
don't want to get that raise I I'll put
in the unj the half pot you know just to
just to not get raised this is like
logical thinking man but like this this
typical thinking that we we had to learn

[30:31]
typical thinking that we we had to learn
more in the old school the the a bit
more new school players especially the
ones who are misusing the sofware like
uh like you were in the beginning you
know they don't think in this type of
way right like the how do we say it like

[30:45]
way right like the how do we say it like
action consequence type of
thinking yeah I I
mean uh yeah I I mean I I've played
video games my whole life so maybe
that's the background of that strategy
like I I like to test things with people

[31:04]
like I I like to test things with people
like in Counter Strike you you go with
the one strategy and see what happens
and then you exploit in the next round
for example and poker is some uh it it's

[31:15]
for example and poker is some uh it it's
close to CS when you think about that in
that
perspective
Adam someone is referring to Counter
Strike do you have any uh background in
gaming I know you've been an athlete but

[31:30]
gaming I know you've been an athlete but
that's mainly Outdoors have you also uh
been spending some time indoors behind
behind the PC behind the PlayStation any
gaming history board
games board games with the family but
nothing to take home a note of uh many
outdoor activities to be honest I was

[31:45]
outdoor activities to be honest I was
quite a sporty kid so when I had free
time I was out in the fields playing
football going for runs uh yeah doing
stuff with friends out outside and
generally poker was my first game that I
really thought wait a second this this
strategy thing could be uh an interest
of mine so yeah I can't can't relate to
the gaming background but yeah obviously

[32:01]
the gaming background but yeah obviously
you have to get into poker I can see the
lifestyles somewhat similar which makes
me want to go into your uh your
background uh where basically um you did
Counter Strike for five years
professionally from age 15 to 20 um what
was it like being a professional Counter

[32:15]
was it like being a professional Counter
Strike player and what was your yeah
General lifestyle at that
time
um yeah it was um I mean you you have to
you had to play like 12 hour in a day
like you you sleep eat and play

[32:31]
like you you sleep eat and play
basically and when you when you are not
playing you are traveling to to events
like I traveled worldwide for 5 years
so it was a busy time I I tried to go to
school at the same time but it was it

[32:47]
school at the same time but it was it
wasn't possible really so I had to quit
school back
then when you were traveling to these
stops how long were you there for was it
like a weekend competition or how was
that
structured um we usually go to training

[33:03]
structured um we usually go to training
camp before any big event so so like it
was like a one week training camp and
maybe one week in the in the tournament
so maybe two weeks and then I go to home

[33:17]
so maybe two weeks and then I go to home
to wash my clothes and then then the go
to other trip
so yeah it was busy time full on
lifestyle yeah what were some of the
lessons you learned from counter- Strike
that maybe helped you transition well

[33:31]
that maybe helped you transition well
into
poker uh yeah like I said uh you learn
to see what how people react on the
different things like like in poker when
you attack they are passive and when you

[33:45]
you attack they are passive and when you
are passive they attack for example and
maybe I mean many many things I I know
many players who have who have been uh
professional counter players they are
now poker players for example I mean

[34:01]
now poker players for example I mean
some of them quit poker few years ago
but but back then like 10 years ago many
former CS players were playing
poker was that one of the reasons you
got into poker did you see other
Counter-Strike players

[34:15]
Counter-Strike players
playing yeah actually um two guys uh SW
Swedish guys were playing professionally
when I when I played like NL 10 they
were playing 1K and I was railing every

[34:30]
were playing 1K and I was railing every
day every every day them and I watched
like how how they can play with the
thousands of Euros like every day like
what what is going on is is this real
money or something and I I talk to them
uh at China I think and and yeah they

[34:47]
uh at China I think and and yeah they
explained me how how does that work and
I was super excited excited about
that so for a novice like me I don't
know much about Counterstrike and I
can't see the kind of similarities with
poker but you guys playing the game

[35:00]
poker but you guys playing the game
could see the overlap so what were you
seeing in poker that overlap with
counter- strike that you thought the
skill set can be reapplied
here
um I don't know I don't know maybe
that's a tough question like H how how

[35:17]
that's a tough question like H how how
to say how to
say so with Counter Strike obviously
you're not playing for money so you a
strategy game and as you mentioned
watching other players play for money
you're like wait a second is this for
real how did you deal with playing a
game which had Financial consequences

[35:31]
game which had Financial consequences
and what was the initial your initial
experience of Poker you started playing
for money well it was a small amount of
money of course when I started but of
course it was uh well excited exciting
but uh same time kind of scary like I'm

[35:48]
but uh same time kind of scary like I'm
losing all my counter- strike Monies to
to the card game like am I am I crazy or
something but yeah when I learned to
play so so uh it it felt easy after that

[36:02]
play so so uh it it felt easy after that
like I didn't care money maybe one year
after playing
so so you were getting a salary for
Counterstrike and then you using that
money to stop playing poker originally
is that right yeah yeah uh we got a

[36:15]
is that right yeah yeah uh we got a
monthly salary it wasn't a a big big
amount back then nowadays it's they they
get crazy monies but uh back then it was
not not so much but yeah uh I spent that

[36:30]
not not so much but yeah uh I spent that
uh on my poker career when I started I I
started NL 50 and I jump into action and
uh I lost like 1K I think and after that
I I was like I I have to move down at

[36:47]
I I was like I I have to move down at
stakes and learn actually how to play
and yeah it was a pretty tough grinding
grinding session after that but yeah
a few questions come to mind first of

[37:01]
a few questions come to mind first of
all how did you begin to learn to play
and what motivated you I'm thinking of
your playing such a high level of
Counter Strike going to like learn a new
game from a beginner level it can be a
little bit why I want to start a new
game I'm already good at this one so
what attracted you to uh to want to

[37:15]
what attracted you to uh to want to
learn poker from the low
level
um H maybe it was the feeling at being
right like it was nice to to know what
people have like I was guessing I didn't

[37:31]
people have like I was guessing I didn't
guess the ranges I guessed the the
actual hand and when you were right it
was a super nice feeling
like I I know I know pretty I'm I'm
pretty good at this game I was thinking
back then but yeah I think that was the

[37:47]
back then but yeah I think that was the
biggest
impact Andor have enough success in
poker that it became more of an option
rather into the side hustle it became
like the the main thing and you started
to uh let your Counter Strike career go

[38:00]
to uh let your Counter Strike career go
to the
side
um yeah I was living back then with my
still with my parents and I was playing
in my own room and I played like one
year or something and uh every morning

[38:15]
year or something and uh every morning
when my parents were going to work they
asked me how much did I win or lose and
it was
like maybe hundreds at first and I
remember the the morning when I told my
dad I won 1K on one one night and he was

[38:33]
dad I won 1K on one one night and he was
like uh oh my God is this real money or
yeah he was super excited about that and
yeah was that a tenant
point I I think it was because I

[38:48]
point I I think it was because I
noticed uh there there is um serious
money in poker and my Stakes got Higher
and Higher and when I moved moved from
my parents I bought my own apartment at

[39:03]
my parents I bought my own apartment at
age
12 uh 20 20 yeah I was back then
so I want to dive into this story so uh
in 2010 you're 20 years old you've made
enough money to buy your own apartment

[39:16]
enough money to buy your own apartment
through poker which is impressive enough
but what's even more impressive is the
environment that you chose to do this
could you share with the audience the uh
the story behind where you made your
money for your apartment
yeah I mean we have a

[39:31]
yeah I mean we have a
mandatory army army command in Finland
so I I had to go to Army at 20 uh 20
2010 January and yeah I was I was

[39:45]
2010 January and yeah I was I was
grinding at at a at the Army and it was
pretty rough time because you have to
wake up at 6:00 a.m. and you go to do do
whatever whatever and you got the free
time at 6 p.m so I started my session at

[40:02]
time at 6 p.m so I started my session at
6 pm and I played like till 4:00 a.m. I
and I slept two hours and woke up again
at 6 6:00 a.m. so it was a pretty pretty

[40:16]
at 6 6:00 a.m. so it was a pretty pretty
tough time back then but yeah I made my
apartment money and when the army army
ended I I could move move to my own
place so a pretty tough time back then
you're in a full Army day then you're

[40:30]
you're in a full Army day then you're
finishing your army day and doing a full
grind through the night sleep in 2 hours
wake up rinse repeat I'm guessing you're
getting woke up to some sort of army
drill as well how were you able to
sustain that and what what kind of
period was that over how long were you
uh how many days AG week where you
grinding I'm was curious to know how you

[40:46]
grinding I'm was curious to know how you
were able to manage this over any period
of time uh actually I I my Army time
lasted like three months because I had a
KNE in in injury
so I I had to stop that and it was
pretty funny when I told to or Captain

[41:02]
pretty funny when I told to or Captain
like I I have to I I can't be here
anymore and he he was like yeah yeah I
know because you want to play poker I
was like I mean my
KNE is hurt hurt really bad so and he

[41:15]
KNE is hurt hurt really bad so and he
didn't believe me and I wouldn't believe
myself either so I understand that but
yeah I I got the home from there so yeah
it was funny as your F CL there
pretending the KNE don't I'm KN yeah
yeah yeah it might it might look that

[41:31]
yeah yeah it might it might look that
but it was it was actually really really
sore yeah yeah life out of the plans for
you po was calling so this time you took
a large part of your bankroll to buy
your apartment and this put you under a
lot of financial pressure so toas for

[41:46]
lot of financial pressure so toas for
what games you were playing before you
bought the apartment and where that left
your bankroll and which games you had to
play after you had had bought
it um I was playing 2K K and 5Ks before
Army and at the Army I played 5Ks 2ks

[42:03]
Army and at the Army I played 5Ks 2ks
1ks then I bought my apartment
I maybe 50% of my bankroll got there and
I was like yeah it's it's nothing I can
I can manage and blah blah blah then I

[42:17]
I can manage and blah blah blah then I
fought my apartment and started to play
and I I lost like every every pot like
in the next six months and I had to
dropped down to NL 200 I think or maybe

[42:30]
dropped down to NL 200 I think or maybe
100 yeah and yeah I started to grind
again
and yeah it went good how did you handle
that step back from a mindset
perspective um of course it was I I

[42:47]
perspective um of course it was I I
couldn't tell my parents I got broke
after half year when
I move from my my home so I like I I
forced to myself to to manage like there

[43:03]
forced to myself to to manage like there
there was not a not on option
to to fail that like I decided to manage
and
yeah there was no plan B so plan a has

[43:15]
yeah there was no plan B so plan a has
got to be double down no no no no only
plan
a it's the way to go so for you I'm
wondering at this time what was your
kind of goals with poker so you bought
the apartment you've took that box off
which is a a big milestone for a lot of
people what was driving you to keep

[43:31]
people what was driving you to keep
playing what was the kind of goals for
the game you
had um well of course I my main goal was
to reach the the biggest levels what
what was there back then I think it
was on Full Tilt 200 400

[43:49]
was on Full Tilt 200 400
tables but uh full um I'm not sure what
year was it or was it stars I'm not sure
but yeah I I tried to reach the highest
level back then so that was my goal and

[44:01]
level back then so that was my goal and
that motivated
me is it similar to your mindset going
into the Counter Strike you're someone
who likes kind of leveling up getting
better at a game and kind of seeing how
far can push
yourself yeah I
was I was super excit excited about

[44:15]
was I was super excit excited about
Counter Strike when I was
um I was um secondary school I I woke up
like 5 500 a.m. before my school day uh
the school started usually at 800 a.m.

[44:31]
the school started usually at 800 a.m.
so I woke up at 5:00 a.m. to play three
hours before my school day and after I I
got back back from school I I started to
play and go to sleep like 10 p.m. when

[44:45]
play and go to sleep like 10 p.m. when
my mother said now it's time to stop
playing and repeat repeat the same
schedule day after day so I was super
motivated on Counter Strike
sounds like you're the guy when you want
to get a goal or achieve something

[45:01]
to get a goal or achieve something
you'll skip sleep you'll do whatever it
takes to uh put the hours in even when
the hours don't appear to be there which
I think is a good skill obviously you've
got to balance that over time to make
sure you don't burn yourself out as yeah
for you and your back at this NL 100
nl200 you've already reached 2ks and 5Ks

[45:17]
nl200 you've already reached 2ks and 5Ks
in the past so for you was your initial
goal just to get your bank roll back up
get back to the levels you've been at
what was your mindset around this period
I think this must been a a challenging
period for you
yeah

[45:30]
yeah
uh yeah of course I had to get my
bankroll back after that crucial crucial
uh six months and after that
yeah I move move up on stakes and I got
to 10K at best then

[45:46]
to 10K at best then
I wait what happened it's it's just a
long long story but
uh at some point I got bored to No Limit
and I was like this is B this this is

[46:02]
and I was like this is B this this is
feeling boring because I was playing
three-handed with ogp Red Baron and
heckin and I was like this is this is
not fun anymore maybe I was losing to
the to the best players of the game back

[46:16]
the to the best players of the game back
then but I mean there was no
recreational players and it it just felt
boring and I I I kind of wanted to play
something new and then I F found out
like there is a game called B liit Omaha

[46:31]
like there is a game called B liit Omaha
and many Finnish players are super good
at that so I was thinking like maybe
maybe I could I could be as good as them
so so I started to play that and yeah I
played played it like one one year

[46:48]
played played it like one one year
without any any No Limit Texas hold them
and yeah I was losing losing one year in
a row to put liit I just couldn't figure
it out

[47:00]
it out
like I still don't know what what I was
doing wrong but yeah that that was a
rough year and after that when I
switched to no hold them I I couldn't
remember anything of my strategy and I

[47:16]
remember anything of my strategy and I
once again I had to move down from 5K to
NL 200 and start
over wow so we've got these two big
start over points I want to go into the
this story playing p naha and maybe some

[47:30]
this story playing p naha and maybe some
lessons you learned through that Journey
but the first thing that came to mind
was yeah I'm wondering what made you
continue to play P for a full year
without much success are you just a
stubborn person did you see some light
in the tunnel were you enjoying the game
what was it about that year that made

[47:45]
what was it about that year that made
you keep
assistant well I was thinking like when
I got volume in like uh I got I I I will
get better in in this game like I
didn't I don't want to quit anything

[48:02]
didn't I don't want to quit anything
like when I test something of course I I
I knew I was going to be bad at at at
the start but when I play like 500 one
500,000 hands I got better that was my

[48:16]
500,000 hands I got better that was my
thinking process and I
didn't why why do you think he didn't
take to the game what do you feel like
with some of the missing things that
maybe obviously you don't know cuz
missing them but why do you feel like
the game didn't really resonate with you

[48:30]
the game didn't really resonate with you
sorry why do you feel like you struggle
with the game so much compared to other
games you
played yeah that's that's a good
question it's hard to answer even
nowadays
because uh I don't know maybe I

[48:45]
because uh I don't know maybe I
was too lose maybe on pre flop and too
nitty on post flop maybe I'm I'm not
sure it was it it was new to me to be so
bad at the game so I I felt kind of old
back then so I was like

[49:03]
back then so I was like
nah so this point it must have been a
pretty uh challenging transition going
back into uh a holder especially when
you've lost a lot of your bankroll
you're now probably eight nine years in
your PO career you haven't really got

[49:15]
your PO career you haven't really got
much to show for it because you just
went through a big down swing playing a
new format you must be like what the
hell I put a long shift in here I've not
got much to show for it so first of all
what was your mindset going back in to
hold him and yeah really like how you
pick yourself up imagine for a lot of
players this would be the end of the

[49:31]
players this would be the end of the
story but it feels like this is almost
like the beginning of
yours yeah I mean I I have to I had to
uh learn learn to game again like
um like like even even the basics of the

[49:47]
um like like even even the basics of the
game like I had to check my ranges for
the first time what what to open from
anything and three from any positions
for example and try to see what people
are doing it it wasn't the solver time

[50:02]
are doing it it wasn't the solver time
back then but it was close to solver
time actually but um
yeah it was tough time to learn the game
because I was playing so much
higher two two years ago so

[50:17]
higher two two years ago so
yeah for a lot of players they would
struggle to uh put their ego to one side
they played a lot higher it's a G play
for a long time they have to relearn it
lower level it's very hard to do that
from a mindset perspective and

[50:30]
from a mindset perspective and
especially ego perspective what do you
think allowed you to just take on that
challenge cuz a lot of players think at
this point would have went all right
Po's Over Now The Glory Days are done
it's got too tough even the LW Stakes
are hard I'm out of here you just went
back in and go right let's learn this
let's
go well like I said uh I didn't have a

[50:47]
go well like I said uh I didn't have a
plan B so I didn't go to school or
anything so I I had to manage again the
and I knew it wasn't impossible
challenge to beat nl2 200 for example

[51:03]
challenge to beat nl2 200 for example
like people weren't that good but I was
super bad but but I learned pretty
quickly what the guys were doing and
yeah it went good after that how long

[51:16]
yeah it went good after that how long
did it take you to uh get back to the
nl1 K from that
point I think it was like uh 6 months
mons or 12 months maybe
but yeah it's it was a slow grind but

[51:33]
but yeah it's it was a slow grind but
yeah it then good and what was the new
goal at this stage of your
career uh the same as earlier to reach
the highest
levels okay the goals the goal stays the

[51:46]
levels okay the goals the goal stays the
same there's a consistent thread line
going through so you say the goal is
always to play higher yeah you spent a
few years quite a while stuck at say NL
500 to NL 2K why do you feel like you uh
didn't push past those levels

[52:00]
didn't push past those levels
quicker
um H um yeah I mean I said um I'm pretty
I was maybe too confident on my levels
because I had a great win rate and I

[52:15]
because I had a great win rate and I
like to withdraw my bank roll like in
every month and
I I did like uh I I didn't raise my bank
R like I didn't decide decide like I'm
not going to withdraw my bank roll in 6

[52:30]
not going to withdraw my bank roll in 6
months like I I withdraw like in every
month and it didn't got bigger at any
point and and in some point I realized
like I I don't need to withdraw and I I
need to raise my bank roll and after

[52:45]
need to raise my bank roll and after
that I mean it's the it's the maybe my
biggest leak because I I withdraw too
often from my bank roll I mean I got
confident with my um stakes and
yeah when you say withdraw your bank

[53:00]
yeah when you say withdraw your bank
roll every month were you spending it on
stuff were you investing it how are you
generally uh managing your
money yeah investing maybe too much and
spending too much and yeah I mean it's

[53:15]
spending too much and yeah I mean it's
it's wise way to use money to invest but
when you are trying to reach the highest
levels you just need to raise uh to get
your bankr bigger of course
when did your mindset switch on that and
when did you start building your bank R

[53:30]
when did you start building your bank R
so you could play
higher
um I think it was a few years ago when
actually Alis bison Finnish PL player
said in one interview like uh what is

[53:45]
said in one interview like uh what is
his biggest
league in he in his career and he said
the same thing like he shouldn't
withdraw his bankroll at any point like
as as little as possible
so it's a quicker way to reach out the
highest levels when you are not doing

[54:03]
highest levels when you are not doing
that so once your bank roll start to
increase by not withdrawing at all was
it a smooth Journey to the 5K 10ks and
above or did you feel like there was
levels that you uh found difficulties
with when moving

[54:17]
with when moving
up um well of course it was at start
pretty rough and at some point I I
started to win pretty pretty much at 5K
after I worked with my with Patrick so

[54:31]
after I worked with my with Patrick so
it help helped me and
yeah for you so the goal has always been
to play higher and play higher Stakes
when do you feel like you've achieved
that when do the goal get fulfilled in

[54:45]
that when do the goal get fulfilled in
your mind currently or as you been for
your journey well I'm still trying to
reach that because I I don't count
myself on on the very top like I'm still
on my journey and I'm trying to reach
the

[55:00]
the
goal just getting started warming up
yeah yeah
exactly so with that would you class
yourself as quite a patient person in
terms of you've you applied yourself for
a long time I know you've only had poiz
your plan a with no plan B so it's
probably been like a a singular Focus

[55:17]
probably been like a a singular Focus
but also you've being obviously
persistent and applying yourself for a
long period of time are you someone
who's class yourselves consistent or
patient towards your goals how would you
generally Define how you've been able to
keep 15 years of a goal in

[55:32]
mind maybe I'm
patient
like I don't know how to answer else
yeah yeah it it takes

[55:46]
yeah yeah it it takes
time You' also say like there's hasn't
been any options other than poker
because you didn't do school but I'm
guessing as you've grown your bank R
other opportunities became available
whether through investing other
opportunities there's not like just one
path that's mapped out though you've

[56:00]
path that's mapped out though you've
chosen poker do you feel like it's being
easy for you to stay on the poker path
or do you feel like there's been
opportunities or times when You' thought
about doing something
else um
h i mean when when when I was

[56:16]
h i mean when when when I was
turning 30 I I was thinking like maybe
poker is over for me and I will I will
go one year at a time like um but but
yeah still nowadays it it feels like
like a funny game to me and I like to

[56:31]
like a funny game to me and I like to
play that so why would I
qu you still enjoy it MH you mentioned
earlier with Rene that you can play
these crazy long sessions like 30 hours
without a break how have you developed

[56:45]
without a break how have you developed
your ability to focus I'm guessing
Counter Strike had a little bit of a
building block there how have you been a
able to train your skill to focus for
long periods without distractions
H H it's hard to

[57:01]
H H it's hard to
say maybe I'm good
at I'm not sure uh it's it's tough to
play uh long sessions like you have to
concentrate like 30 hours in in a one

[57:16]
concentrate like 30 hours in in a one
one seat
so I I don't know may maybe it's the
video games in in the background on that
but yeah you can't really learn that
like you have to play a long

[57:32]
like you have to play a long
sessions yeah I think 30 hours would be
the extreme version but I'm guessing
your average session length say maybe 8
10 hours even then that's quite a a long
amount of time to be focused for which
I'm guessing for you feels quite
comfortable compared to a normal player

[57:47]
comfortable compared to a normal player
MH yeah I try to play four to six hours
nowadays to get my eame only a
only okay interesting so what were you
playing before that obviously the 30

[58:00]
playing before that obviously the 30
hours exception what was your general
approach before you decided on four to
six hours maybe 8 to 10 hours was pretty
standard to Me Maybe 5,000 to 10,000
hands in a

[58:16]
hands in a
session so I I I had I had years when I
played over 1 million hands and when I
didn't play 1 million hand hand
it felt like I was lazy or something
when when I look back that volume it's

[58:31]
when when I look back that volume it's
pretty unique like there are no that
much players who played like million
hands in one year
so yeah I think it's easy as well to get
the metric of how many hands you play as

[58:45]
the metric of how many hands you play as
like the win it's like oh million hands
that's that's the biggest win I can get
and then anything less is like you said
lazy not put of effort in when did you
shift your mindset towards let's say
more quality over quantity when did you
decide okay actually playing 500,000
hands at high qualities better than

[59:00]
hands at high qualities better than
maybe playing a million cuz I'm guessing
that wasn't a a smooth or natural
transition I mean i' I've always know
that like when I play less hands I play
so much better and but it's it's hard to

[59:15]
so much better and but it's it's hard to
execute when I when you are actually
playing like because I'm just I'm I'm
obsessed with the game and it's hard to
quit my session and when there's
recreational players playing I I can't
quit I will play as long as they are

[59:31]
quit I will play as long as they are
playing and there's new recreational
comes and I was like I can't quit my
session
basically do you think that's something
that you're pleased with in terms of

[59:45]
that you're pleased with in terms of
does that make you the most money
because I think all these decisions in
the moment you can get caught up in it
but then after you reflect on it it's
like H was that a good decision and
sometimes it's like yeah actually that
was a lot of money there other times
like nope my sleep is ruined I feel a
wreck so for you do you feel like these
decisions to stay up and Chase the fish

[1:00:00]
decisions to stay up and Chase the fish
money is generally a good
one uh most of the time there are bad
decisions like uh when you are half
sleeping at your at your chair and like
I I shouldn't be playing right now I'm

[1:00:16]
I I shouldn't be playing right now I'm
I'm so so tired and the clock is like 10
10: a.m. like you have to go to sleep
like yeah usually they are really bad
decisions and I try to avoid them

[1:00:30]
decisions and I try to avoid them
nowadays experience and wisdom gets you
to make those less often I'm guessing
still occasionally you fall into that
pattern especially when it's a a big
whale there how do you recover from
those days let's say you have one of
those 8 a.m. 10: a.m. long grinds how do
you get yourself back on track because I

[1:00:45]
you get yourself back on track because I
feel a lot of players struggle with this
when they go off schedule and they do
these Marathon sessions how does that
affect the rest of your week and how do
you get back into a more stable routine
again yeah it's pretty depressing to
wake up at 7 p.m. like when uh I mean

[1:01:03]
wake up at 7 p.m. like when uh I mean
when you're living in Finland there's
dark darkness everywhere at at 7 P p.m.
so yeah it's really depressing to I I
try to avoid that as well like I try to

[1:01:16]
try to avoid that as well like I try to
keep my schedule like in
a uh in Balance but sometimes it it goes
totally opposite and yeah
it's not it's not
fun what does a balance schedule look

[1:01:30]
fun what does a balance schedule look
like for you these
days well I'm not sure it's is it
balanced but uh I I try to go to sleep
6:00 a.m. and wake up at 3 3 P.M so I'm
able to see Sun

[1:01:47]
sometimes but at at summer summer uh I I
try to Avo playing that much because the
weather is so good in Finland for three
months in a year so I I try to enjoy

[1:02:00]
months in a year so I I try to enjoy
that
time a seasonal grinder you take the
some to do more fun stuff yeah it's
easier to say than execute
actually yeah I can imagine when you've
got that love for the game what do you
feel like still keeps poker curious for

[1:02:15]
feel like still keeps poker curious for
you because you've been playing 15 years
I'm sure you've seen many run many run
outs every kind of combo you can every
player type what do you feel like still
keeps this game 15 years later still
novel wanted to learn and want to
improve um I mean it's interesting when

[1:02:32]
improve um I mean it's interesting when
the game changes like in every year
basically and it's interesting to learn
what people are doing and I'm not sure
it's h yeah I mean the game evolves in

[1:02:46]
it's h yeah I mean the game evolves in
every year so it keeps me interested of
the
game do you enjoy how players are trying
to implement different strategies are
you more curious about the the kind of
human side of how players are changing

[1:03:00]
human side of how players are changing
rather than like your own knowledge of
how you're learning the game if that
makes sense um sorry do you feel like
you've got a curiosity for how other
players are trying toh change their
strategy over time are you like a
curious guy of what the your opponents

[1:03:15]
curious guy of what the your opponents
are doing and trying to keep up with the
kind of psychology of your opponents is
that something that you gravitate
towards more than just like learning
your own strategy to a higher
level um
H hard hard to say hard to say uh I I'm

[1:03:30]
H hard hard to say hard to say uh I I'm
not sure I'm not
sure there's something keeping you going
you've got this curiosity which you
enjoy so of the habits and routines
you've established which do you think
have been the biggest game changers for
increasing your poker performance this
could be anything from time you go to

[1:03:45]
could be anything from time you go to
bed exercise habits just grinding less
studying any habits or routines that you
feel like have moved the performance
needer the most for
you uh well
like I said earlier the balanced
schedule is pretty important to like

[1:04:02]
schedule is pretty important to like
eating and sleeping good before my my
session it's
super super important like few times in
a month I I go to play without eating

[1:04:16]
a month I I go to play without eating
that good or slept really bad or
something and you can instantly see that
on my results so that yeah that's pretty
important
interesting what's your pre-session meal

[1:04:31]
choice
H maybe chicken and rice maybe yeah and
broccoli nice not a biger pizza that's
that's good yeah yeah for you how do you

[1:04:45]
that's good yeah yeah for you how do you
make food choices around the grinds I
think this is the one as well for
players who play larger volume I know
you've cut down your volume all recently
how do you think about food choices
around the grind when you're going to
break do you just wait to get hungry do
you have food prepared how do you
generally structure your meal choices

[1:05:00]
generally structure your meal choices
around the
grind well that's a bad habit because I
don't really have breaks on my session
like I don't have snack breaks or
anything so I mean I don't eat when I
play I play when I stop playing I mean I

[1:05:17]
play I play when I stop playing I mean I
mean I eat when I stop
playing but yeah I have I have I have
fix that habit sorry what happens if you
get hungry like say you're playing 10
hours or eight hours in the old days no

[1:05:31]
hours or eight hours in the old days no
no I I forgot everything when I'm
playing I just I'm just super focused on
playing so I I don't know what what is
being thirsty or hungry or
anything wow you override survival needs

[1:05:45]
anything wow you override survival needs
impressive yeah I can I can relate to
that at times by getting your sword M
and stuff you forget that you're hungry
then you finish you're like I'm
absolutely starving but yeah it's quite
impressive to uh have that as a default
and you never think about food so yeah
if you can pull it off all right for you

[1:06:00]
if you can pull it off all right for you
you mentioned earlier that you don't
tilt um I wonder then did you have to
work on this have you always been
someone who uh doesn't get any emotions
whilst you play or has this been
something that you've developed by years
of
experience H I don't know I'm pretty
calm person like I don't tilt like ever

[1:06:20]
calm person like I don't tilt like ever
and my I I think it's for my parents
because they are super cool as well like
I I've never saw they they go crazy or
anything like so I think I I've learned

[1:06:33]
anything like so I think I I've learned
that at a uh as a child so
yeah so I I didn't ever practice or
anything I don't I don't have any like
mental issues or anything

[1:06:46]
mental issues or anything
so yeah that sounds good sounds like uh
good Role Models around you kind of
instilled a maybe a good emotional
regulation and you didn't yeah feel feel
the need to express emotions or
dissatisfaction yeah I remember my my my

[1:07:00]
dissatisfaction yeah I remember my my my
dad dad always said like it doesn't help
when you when you go crazy like what
does that help and it was it was a
pretty good
advice yeah it's so true it just it can
be hard sometimes to uh let the

[1:07:15]
be hard sometimes to uh let the
rationale overcome an emotion for
example I go I shouldn't be angry right
now but I'm angry it can be hard to kind
override that but yeah it's a true thing
where if you actually reflect often the
emotion that you experienced didn't help
the situation especially when you're
you're kind of lingering in an emotion
you're just frustrated you kind of

[1:07:30]
you're just frustrated you kind of
complain about something it's like all
right this is not helping do you want to
drop it yeah really good all right so
for you in terms of like your your
personal life we talked a lot about
poker poker poker what is life look like
away from the tables do you have any
hobbies that you still do do you have
any uh things that you do away from the

[1:07:46]
any uh things that you do away from the
tables that create some sort of balance
for
you well I'm I try to
exercise uh like every week but I'm I'm
pretty lazy nowadays I I used to
exercise more and I might start again

[1:08:02]
exercise more and I might start again
but yeah I'm chilling with my girlfriend
and my dog and we are watching movies
and making food and pretty basic stuff I
don't I don't have any that kind of
hobbies
like yeah and on a weekends I spend time

[1:08:17]
like yeah and on a weekends I spend time
with my friends and family and pretty
basic
stuff do you take set days off a week or
do you have any regular days off from
poker or you do it based on

[1:08:30]
poker or you do it based on
feel um well I I play mostly every day
actually maybe six days in a in a week I
try to keep one day of of the tables but
yeah I still play when I'm hangover or
something on the Sundays or Saturdays

[1:08:48]
something on the Sundays or Saturdays
so every like old days yeah
yeah I wondering for you how do you you
deal with making mistakes and like the
uncertainty that's built in the pokam I
know maybe now you've got a lot of

[1:09:01]
know maybe now you've got a lot of
experience with kind of maybe learning
from there but as you've went for your
career have you had any challenges with
how you've dealt with uncertainty and
making mistakes especially as you've
tried to progress well yeah I I've had
some FR frustration frustration tilt

[1:09:17]
some FR frustration frustration tilt
like
um like yeah some spots are really
frustrating for me
but yeah and a sure how do you approach
risk-taking and moving of M Stakes so

[1:09:30]
risk-taking and moving of M Stakes so
you mentioned earlier that you were
taking up lot of your bank roll out of
your every month so you didn't have a
bank roll growing I'm wondering like for
you when you think about shooting higher
how do you kind of think about the risk
versus the opportunity because every
player sits there with their bank roll
and they go what Stak should I be

[1:09:45]
and they go what Stak should I be
playing and if you've got a good win
rate there comes a point where shooting
the higher stake often makes the most
sense and you've obviously moved up all
the levels you've actually moved up the
levels probably three different times
just stopping and starting and going
again so I'm Wonder for you uh how do
you process make taken risk in terms of
shot taken higher and when's a good time

[1:10:01]
shot taken higher and when's a good time
to make make a
jump well if you can handle the the
money money behind the stakes you you
should always take shots but it it can
be really frustrating when when the

[1:10:15]
be really frustrating when when the
shots go over and over not so good and
you lost like 100 by binds on your
normal stake so I know that feeling
that's that's that's not a good
feeling how do you know if you can

[1:10:30]
feeling how do you know if you can
handle
it well when you when you make the same
same thing over and over you kind of get
used to it and you have to live with it
live with that and with your decisions

[1:10:46]
live with that and with your decisions
and but yeah it's
tough are you someone who like say you
shot it and it doesn't go well would you
generally uh
just be ready to go again somewhat
quickly I'm seeing that in terms of
because this kind of trial and error of

[1:11:00]
because this kind of trial and error of
Taken risk it's not always black and
white of it goes well it doesn't go well
there's often like a bit of stop stess
to it where your shot take a new level
get slapped around a bit go back rebuild
and go again but the mindset that you
have throughout the period I think is
important so for you like let's say your
shot take another level you take a step

[1:11:16]
shot take another level you take a step
back by Los to bayin would you be quite
quick to want to try again or how would
you generally process those
moments yeah you you have to I mean I
I'm the person who just recind your
bankroll and go to take shot as soon as

[1:11:32]
bankroll and go to take shot as soon as
possible like and it's never ending
circle
basically interesting so what allows you
to do that what's your how do you frame
shot taken that makes it almost like a a

[1:11:45]
shot taken that makes it almost like a a
free roll to to shot take because it
feels like that's how it looks yeah of
course you you think the the level is
rigged or something and you are are so
crazy about that and you are feeling bad
even to take shots I I know some players

[1:12:01]
even to take shots I I know some players
are like that at me me in including like
it it feels so bad to take shots but and
every every time they go they go not on
my way and it might be scary but yeah it

[1:12:16]
my way and it might be scary but yeah it
will turn out when you try that many
times how do you keep your motivation
High I'm curious to know if 15 years of
showing up every day it still feels like
you want to keep learning and want to

[1:12:30]
you want to keep learning and want to
keep playing I'm just wondering how you
uh keep that motivation so consistent
for so
long um well good question maybe maybe
just a video game habit behind my at my

[1:12:46]
just a video game habit behind my at my
background like because I like playing
games and poker is a game so why why not
to play even i' I've played the game
like 15 years so but I still enjoy that
then yeah why would I

[1:13:01]
then yeah why would I
quit every video game is fun until you
complete it or you get bored of it
because the stimulus and the novelty
wears off why do you feel like poker
keeps bringing you back in I'm sure
other games you've played for a year or
two maybe less Po's 15 years it's still

[1:13:15]
two maybe less Po's 15 years it's still
the infinite game is if the they never
get into that Final Destination I was
curious because a lot of players would
myself included get an end point where
like okay I've played it for long enough
now I'm kind of motivation isn't as
strong as it used to be but for you it
feels like it almost like a trick

[1:13:30]
feels like it almost like a trick
question you're like yeah of course it
is but I'm curious to know why you feel
like poker still has that appeal to
you well I'm still on my journey to
reach the highest level so I can't quit
at this point

[1:13:45]
at this point
so well we'll see what happens in five
years when I'm 40 but maybe I get too
old and I give up but at this point it
it doesn't it's not an option for
me let's do a thought experiment we go

[1:14:01]
me let's do a thought experiment we go
five years in the future it's your 40th
birthday you're playing the highest
stakes in the game you're crushing got a
nice win rate and you've ticked all the
boxes you can't say play higher because
you're playing the highest possible how
do you think you would think about poker
then maybe I quit when I reach that my

[1:14:16]
then maybe I quit when I reach that my
goal and move on on the next game maybe
b or something go again no no Battle
Scars for you you're ready to start that
that Quest again oh my God yeah hope not
well you never know it could be it could

[1:14:30]
well you never know it could be it could
go very differently this time it's
interesting is it because like when
you're when you're climbing a mountain
in your own head you you've got an
objective and you're climbing that next
step it's almost like it's the
motivation is just there because you
want to get that next level regardless
of what it looks like regardless from
the outside because it's clear in your

[1:14:46]
the outside because it's clear in your
mind there's a jump that you need to
make and the intrinsic motivation to
keep going is very strong and I think
for you what you you what's been obvious
for your career and your longevity is
you've always felt like there's the next
level to climb to you've never felt like
you've got to a level where you're happy

[1:15:00]
you've got to a level where you're happy
with you're comfortable I think a lot of
players will get to certain Stakes where
they feel their lifestyle changes or
they feel they've achieved some
objectives but it feels like for you
because the the goal is the highest
there is no The Climb is just there
until you get there so um yeah I'm
really motivated and inspired by the

[1:15:16]
really motivated and inspired by the
fact 15 years later that is still there
that's a North star that's lasted 15
years I think a lot of players and
people would generally uh have changed
goals change priorities but you you kept
it strong which is very
impressive yeah it's crazy to think like

[1:15:30]
impressive yeah it's crazy to think like
I I couldn't picture myself playing 15
years I I thought it it was it it's
going to be like five years and I quit
and move on with my life but after 15
years it yeah it sounds
crazy it still feels like it's getting

[1:15:46]
crazy it still feels like it's getting
started which is even
crazy

let's continue today's
episode R I'm curious enough for you
you've also had 15 years in po how have
your goals in North Stars changed as

[1:18:00]
your goals in North Stars changed as
you've grown in po I I would say I had a
similar experience to Samu where I also
I kind of scared myself in the beginning
then I had like a period where I was
just playing mid Stakes Cashing Out
living basically like a lot of safety

[1:18:15]
living basically like a lot of safety
then I got into touch with uh with
Flores friend of mine and he was like he
instilled this belief or this idea that
we could actually become the best and I
never really thought about that so when
he instilled that belief like okay we're
going to try to become the best you

[1:18:30]
going to try to become the best you
start to think like okay wow okay you
know if I'm going to try to become the
best what would I need to do in order to
become the best and then you start and
then you know you you reach up you reach
up reach up and I remember that for me
personally at my Peak then at some point
I was like yeah but I that was

[1:18:45]
I was like yeah but I that was
interesting because when I came to my
Peak at that moment me I was not the
best but I felt like I was at least
competing with the best and there were
just a couple guys that I I was not
going to believe uh not going to beat
like lonus JM Gil big blind bats back

[1:19:01]
like lonus JM Gil big blind bats back
then
OTB I was like ah but you know I feel I
feel like the rest I can take uh so yeah
and at at as soon as I kind of got there
I was like yeah now what so that that
was for me and then actually that's
actually when I switched into into uh

[1:19:17]
actually when I switched into into uh
into coaching and stuff like that
because I felt like in order to keep on
growing I had to start to do other
things as well
um so that that was kind of where for me
it started to yeah to kind of pursue

[1:19:30]
it started to yeah to kind of pursue
other goals than just uh playing poker
I'm I'm wondering uh Samu you said that
you're still on your
journey what would you need to
improve uh in order to uh to reach this
goal of

[1:19:47]
yours well I'm not going to relieve my
leags but I'm working on them and
hopefully they will
turn good for me but but how do you
about like finding your leagues

[1:20:00]
about like finding your leagues
improving your
game well I'm checking my database with
my uh well yeah I I look on data on my
playing and some hands

[1:20:15]
playing and some hands
and I yeah I look with the wiard at my
PL hands and my stats and yeah and try
to find some exploits on players like
what they what they are doing to exploit

[1:20:31]
what they what they are doing to exploit
me for example and
yeah are you trying to look for like
behavior that is outside of let's say
the norm that they might show to you and
you kind of Wonder like okay why would
you do that to me is that kind of the
process that you go

[1:20:46]
process that you go
through yeah
basically and in terms of like leak
finding basically you're you're trying
to look at your data trying to see where
you're solid and any spot where you
deviate you kind of Wonder okay why is
this on is this on purpose then I guess

[1:21:00]
this on is this on purpose then I guess
you drill a lot do do you do lot of
drilling GTO wizard like Drilling in the
spots where you're currently leaking to
find like let's let's say you're
overfolded small seabat you go in the
Wizard and see okay which hand do I
constantly Miss and train those hands is

[1:21:17]
constantly Miss and train those hands is
that kind of how it looks like yeah
that's a good
example like yeah that's really helpful
to drill those spots which are
super
often do you nowadays
prioritize study and do you also think

[1:21:31]
prioritize study and do you also think
feel like it's easier to to priori study
when you kind of know what to look for
so for example I can imagine you know a
lot of of our audience also listening
everyone's motivated to improve but
they're like yeah what what do I need to
work on but I feel like when you and
this is also when I feel most motivated

[1:21:45]
this is also when I feel most motivated
to play poker when I'm aware of leaks
and things that I have to improve that's
when I become most motivated ah I
started sessing I can try to improve on
this improve on that
does that seem
familiar yeah that's a yeah you said

[1:22:01]
familiar yeah that's a yeah you said
said it like like it is like yeah you
you should drill at the spots which
occur the the most often times like for
example BL versus BL
situations which is like every time when

[1:22:16]
situations which is like every time when
you're playing so that's good
example what do you feel like is a big
waste of time that people put a lot of
time into imp poker that's actually not
really adding a lot of EV to their win

[1:22:34]
rate H I don't know hard hard to
say what in the past have you spent a
lot of time on that in hindsight was

[1:22:45]
lot of time on that in hindsight was
maybe not a big contributor to your win
rate uh well like I said earlier like
playing too too long and I didn't T
table select at my old days like I
didn't know what what means table

[1:23:00]
didn't know what what means table
selecting I I select I selected the
tables at start at my session I played
them and when when they died I opened a
new one I I didn't know I I didn't know
what what what means to table select
like back in the

[1:23:16]
like back in the
day in back in the day I I sh I Shar
this table selection was I don't know I
just start up table let's go you know uh
but it was also I feel like less
important uh to be fair maybe when I was

[1:23:30]
important uh to be fair maybe when I was
in a down I should have or when things
were not going my way maybe that's was
actually something that was missing so
I'm I'm not really sure what do you what
do you think sets the high six guys
apart from the mid Stakes guys right
you're on your journey you're trying to

[1:23:45]
you're on your journey you're trying to
rise up the stakes beat the best sure
you know you're you're you're looking at
your own game to find you know
weaknesses that you can improve but
you're also looking at other people
people's games right and when you face
these tough
opponents what do they do that make them
so tough to play

[1:24:03]
against well H they don't fold as often
as players at medium stakes and they can
they can find Bluffs in every spot like

[1:24:16]
they can find Bluffs in every spot like
you have some spot when when you know
people are not never bluffing on that
spot and when you play high stakes
people are capable of fighting those low

[1:24:30]
people are capable of fighting those low
frequency gloves for
example but yeah I I think that's a well
maybe that's a boring answer but it's
true does that trigger like for example
I I I understand what you mean let's say
you play for a more nitty opponent

[1:24:46]
you play for a more nitty opponent
that's never going to find a bluff and
that's always going to over fold like
there's a lot of certainty in your
decisions like you you just always Bluff
this combo and you just never hear call
in a certain spot when players get
better you know they play better ranges
you you you're basically being put in

[1:25:01]
you you you're basically being put in
more indifferent situations right does
that trigger more uncertainty and doubt
when you play and how do you handle that
in in sessions right because there's
less spots coming up where the decision
is easy does like doubt every Creek came
in like because you're constantly in

[1:25:15]
in like because you're constantly in
like these in different situations yeah
of course you might be skeptical when
when you are and you are might you start
to think like like R say just bullying
you around because you are taking shots
and you like think they are super humans

[1:25:31]
and you like think they are super humans
or something but they they might
actually over Pluff in some spots like I
I don't know it's hard to say but yeah
yeah I feel like for a human it's
impossible to make you indifferent like

[1:25:46]
impossible to make you indifferent like
a solver makes you indifferent so
there's always yeah there's always if we
really put all the responsibility on us
there's always
a way to try to figure out if it's more
likely that it's over bluffing or under
bluffing just accordingly but you know
when you have a bunch of tables it's

[1:26:01]
when you have a bunch of tables it's
just very hard to pull off especially
when it comes out to the more unnatural
Bluffs I feel like when you play for
opponent who finds them it's easy than
to find them too often so you either
have someone who just never finds them
and then you have the guys who find them
always you know because you know if you

[1:26:15]
always you know because you know if you
can only uh you know if only pocket
doces or pocket threes at a certain
frequency is allowed but you have do to
fives
yeah you know it's like oh I have a low
parach should BL this m no you have to
PLU exactly you know it's like

[1:26:31]
PLU exactly you know it's like
uh I'm curious what uh you know 15 years
of Poker what is the best advice you've
ever been given in poker and how is that
impacted your career or your life in
general uh the advice what I got from

[1:26:46]
general uh the advice what I got from
someone the best advice that you've got
over your over your poker career that is
either improves your life or your poker
career
um maybe table selecting to finally
finally know know what what that means

[1:27:00]
finally know know what what that means
like you don't have to play with five
regulars for 12 hours like you you can
quit the table and select the easier
table for example and if you care money
but if you want to play go ahead did you

[1:27:16]
but if you want to play go ahead did you
have any resistance accepting that you
know this is a real reality of Poker or
when this was explained to you were like
oh thank you very much let's
go well it it took many years to me to
understand that

[1:27:30]
understand that
because I mean it it might look weak
when you quit the best players
like again it's the background of me to
play games at high level level but I
mean you can't quit the games you have

[1:27:48]
mean you can't quit the games you have
to play them until the the guys will
quit I feel like also and you know we're
talking about quite extreme but
obviously there's there's a difference
between just hopping any table and not
having any selective criteria to at

[1:28:01]
having any selective criteria to at
least you know make sure that you know
when when when you're battling you're
not against up to you're not up against
number one two and three but maybe
against number 10 15 and 20 you know
that's already an improvement right from
for playing one two and

[1:28:15]
for playing one two and
three yeah and especially when you're
taking shots you you have to you have to
table select something at least nowadays
but back back then when I was taking
shots I I really didn't care who I'm
playing am I playing six Max or heads up

[1:28:32]
playing am I playing six Max or heads up
I didn't care I just played and lost my
half of my bank roll at at the head up
match for example I remember back in the
day when uh I think this is what when
scripting and stuff became popular I

[1:28:46]
scripting and stuff became popular I
mean you you went through this time as
well right uh that there was like a
negative belief around bum Hunters just
like oh but this guy's a bum Hunter you
know and then I remember I remember I
think it was Elliot Ro I heard him say
yeah who who do you think is reinforcing

[1:29:01]
yeah who who do you think is reinforcing
this uh disbelief it's the bum Hunters
because they don't want you to bum they
know how profitable it is yeah I
remember myself I I was like I didn't
respect the bomb Hunters like like they
are not even poker poker players to my

[1:29:17]
are not even poker poker players to my
perspective like short sters and bum
Hunters yeah yeah yeah yeah
exactly Z
respect yeah and it was you know uh yeah
it took a little bit time it took a bit

[1:29:30]
it took a little bit time it took a bit
a little bit of time to realize that bum
hunting you know it's it's is is part of
the game or at least you're you're
trying to optimize your oi it's not like
you and then obviously depends also on
your own skill level like there's some
real extreme extreme extreme bum Hunters
out there and there's just you know like

[1:29:47]
out there and there's just you know like
for example when I play I have room for
a couple of slots and when I have no
table Yeah I happily jump into nice
four-handed game no problem but when
there when suddenly a a will come sit
down another table I'm like hey guys got

[1:30:00]
down another table I'm like hey guys got
to go because you know I have four to
six slots and I'm trying to optimize my
hourly for the slots that I have so this
table has now got to go but sometimes I
can also be battling on two three tables
because there's nothing else to my yeah
my disposal right yeah same for me like

[1:30:15]
my disposal right yeah same for me like
if if I'm
feeling uh like that I'm playing my aame
so why not but yeah when I got 12 tables
like I have to be more careful who I'm
playing but nowadays when I'm playing

[1:30:31]
playing but nowadays when I'm playing
less tables I can play those those
guys seems like a very solid advice what
is the worst advice you've been

[1:30:50]
given well I'm I'm not sure I can't I
can come up with
anything so you mentioned um um that you

[1:31:02]
anything so you mentioned um um that you
usually prefer to play right play play
play nowadays studying it seems like
it's become a little bit more easy for
you right since you kind of and I think
like being pointed out where your leaks
are and how to improve obviously that
helps build a little bit more rout and

[1:31:15]
helps build a little bit more rout and
also be more motivated to study how has
your study process evolved over the
years well I started to study like maybe
five years ago so I spent only playing

[1:31:30]
five years ago so I spent only playing
like 10 years and when I found out you
can actually study the
poker and yeah nowadays I study
maybe maybe an hour in a day and it's

[1:31:46]
maybe maybe an hour in a day and it's
it's not still that much but well it's
something how like I I I understand what
you mean like in the past I feel like it
was more you just jump into tables and
you've being put in a situation you make

[1:32:00]
you've being put in a situation you make
a decision you know you you try to
figure out what the best play on the Fly
where nowadays it's you know way more
common that at least you have some sort
of idea of a strategy before you even
sit down at the table where in the pass
it was maybe a little bit different how
has having a strategy before you

[1:32:16]
has having a strategy before you
actually sit down instead of having to
figure out everything on apply helped
you in poker like how does your
experience of playing poker nowadays is
different when you at least have an idea
of what to do in most

[1:32:30]
scenarios I mean it's easier when you
don't have to focus on everything like
you have the the basic strategy at least
like back in the day you didn't have
that you just played the every single

[1:32:45]
that you just played the every single
person like like a unique player and you
you had to make your own adjustments on
every player but nowadays when you have
the basic strategy it's a lot easier and
you kind of have to focus on some things

[1:33:02]
you kind of have to focus on some things
but but most of the time you are just
autop piloting the basic situations for
example and then you already mentioned
it autop piling that then can can become
a threat how do you make sure that you

[1:33:17]
a threat how do you make sure that you
know autop piloting doesn't take to
another level where you're not anymore
processing new information to come in
and allowing to make better
decisions well nowadays I notice that
pretty quickly when that comes up when

[1:33:32]
pretty quickly when that comes up when
I'm playing my b game and I try
to take a short break or end up my
session or something but yeah I try to
avoid that because it it really costs
you money what would be a sign that like

[1:33:46]
you money what would be a sign that like
oh this is out of
pilot
uh uh well for example yes yesterday I
was playing and I missed the the super
clear Pluff spot on the river and I kind

[1:34:00]
clear Pluff spot on the river and I kind
of sit out leave instantly when that
happened and i' I've improved on that
pretty much in in the in the last
year what do you do then you you you
take a step back you you figure out hey

[1:34:15]
take a step back you you figure out hey
why did I do that or you go for a walk
throw some water in your face what do
you do well I went to yesterday I went
to sleep sleep because I no this I'm I'm
I'm not in my best G best shape so so I
was like well that's it for today and I

[1:34:31]
was like well that's it for today and I
will play tomorrow again on my aame for
example but what if you just started I
mean you know it's uh it's it's a8m it's
too early to go to
bed well how do you how do you basically
try to get back in back in your aame

[1:34:45]
try to get back in back in your aame
that's kind of I guess the the question
that I'm trying to ask what do you do to
try to get back in your a g when you
notice that you're playing bad but you
know there's still
at least four more hours to go uh well
it's it's hard to make in the same day
like I need to sleep between that

[1:35:04]
like I need to sleep between that
because uh it's rare when I play two
sessions in a day I'm I only play one
session in a day and when I'm done I'm
done and I continue on the next day

[1:35:15]
done and I continue on the next day
there's no uh trying to revive your
current
session no no it's it's pretty rare
where do you uh believe that most of the
EV in poker comes

[1:35:30]
from well it's
obvious worse players than you are but
uh strategy Wise
It's well there are still players who
are not like um learning I mean studying

[1:35:48]
are not like um learning I mean studying
in a daily basis like people who are not
using GTO visard and they are missing so
much some basic
spots which people know who are using

[1:36:01]
spots which people know who are using
the
solvers like when you play for example
500 NL there are maybe half of the recks
are not studying at all for example pre
flop ranges people are not forbit

[1:36:17]
flop ranges people are not forbit
bluffing enough and you just have to
adjust that
you mentioned like uh being a bit bit
too passive in this case right not
finding the four B Bluffs I think you
already mentioned like people fold more

[1:36:31]
already mentioned like people fold more
blood fles any
other clear leaks that you see at like
mid Stakes you know all over audience
listening maybe any advice for them like
some leaks that you could maybe Point
them out that they're probably doing

[1:36:46]
wrong yeah being too
passive overall I mean pre flop flop
turn River
like it's true Did You Have Faces in
your career where you were too passive

[1:37:00]
your career where you were too passive
and how did you overcome it because I
feel like if you're naturally just
passive and risk adverse you know it's
not like you sit down today I'm not
going to be passive and risk verse [ __ ]
it I'm got a show no does you know I've
tried that but it's a more long-term

[1:37:15]
tried that but it's a more long-term
process have you would you say that
you're naturally a bit more passive and
how did you if so did you over how did
you overcome it well when I started to
play poker I Tri at 50% so I I was super
Maniac when I started but but then I got

[1:37:32]
Maniac when I started but but then I got
maybe passive side and some point I was
super passive because I was playing too
many tables and too many hours and when
I when I play too much I just naturally
go too passive so I try to keep my

[1:37:47]
go too passive so I try to keep my
sessions shorter nowadays but yeah
definitely I I had that time on my
career what do you think is uh one of
the biggest misconceptions or flawed

[1:38:00]
the biggest misconceptions or flawed
beliefs that people have about poker
about being a professional poker
player well they think they are playing
against computers on every table and
they are following the solvers like

[1:38:15]
they are following the solvers like
calling too much to people who aren
bluffing on any Street for example
are
calling calling forets to light maybe
against people who are not forbet

[1:38:31]
against people who are not forbet
bluffing
anything for
example so it feels like the they're not
taking in consideration the fact that
they're play against humans and you have
to adjust against humans is that what
you exactly yeah yeah especially for

[1:38:47]
you exactly yeah yeah especially for
players who are not experienced
like uh the players who studied only
with the solvers like in 5 years and
they are they are not they don't know
how to exploit

[1:39:02]
how to exploit
people like you can overfall against
forbids when people are forb betting
only Kings Plus for
example was it something that you just
understood intuitively or did you need
to not loock some Sims and be like okay
well now I understand that if the Sims

[1:39:16]
well now I understand that if the Sims
say so this is how it is no I I only uh
always know that I I didn't have to not
loock to understand that yeah and I feel
like this kind of where the experience
or at Le starting pre

[1:39:30]
or at Le starting pre
poker I would almost say logical
thinking comes in where I just think L
you know well the solver call because
the guy's bluffing enough well if the
guy's not bluffing enough you going to
call right yeah yeah that's pretty
logical Adam any uh face in your career

[1:39:50]
logical Adam any uh face in your career
that uh you noticed that the game or
like The Meta was really shifting to
heav heavy heavy solver use and did you
see any common mistakes like the one

[1:40:00]
see any common mistakes like the one
that Sam would just pointed
out yeah I remember playing a Reich
battle I think it was $300 heads up
sitting go and in heads up you play Big
ranges and then the point I was playing
was he was a massive ISO strategy like
ISO and made like 45 50% like super

[1:40:17]
ISO and made like 45 50% like super
aggressive and I was like oh this guy's
easy money going to destroy him but he's
put me in a lots of tough spots and I
was like wow this is uh this ISO
pressure has put my limping range under
a lot of pressure in different spots and
then I realized he'd read like will
Tipton's book which was a heads up head

[1:40:32]
Tipton's book which was a heads up head
of specialist book and solvas had just
started to come out and will Tipton was
uh applying Sala knowledge through a b
format there was also ear solvas I was
like hm maybe these New Kids on the
Block aren't that bad and actually the
strategy is changing I remember that
time it was just before Sala Salas are

[1:40:46]
time it was just before Sala Salas are
just starting to come out and people
talking about kind of G2 as a concept
and I remember that was definitely uh
all the what players are doing also
small sizing as you mentioned like this
25% C bet it's like hm like for like a
RAR pre flop then a 25% SE bet I'm like

[1:41:01]
RAR pre flop then a 25% SE bet I'm like
that's not the default sizeing and it
became quite obvious quite quickly that
things were changing that the at least
certain players were going down this
Avenue and yeah was a bit of a thought
experience like if they go down that
Avenue and I stick to my current
strategy who wins and then after a while
you're like wait a second maybe uh keep

[1:41:16]
you're like wait a second maybe uh keep
it up with time with the times is going
to be a a smarter move but yeah I think
there obviously you've went through all
the changes some like every change
that's happened in poker pretty much all
of them that a meanful you've kind of
experienced them which is super
interesting so I'm wondering for you
like looking back on your PO career

[1:41:31]
like looking back on your PO career
what's been the most enjoyable phase of
your career and why was it the most
enjoyable
um I like to play back in the day when
people were playing naturally like we

[1:41:46]
people were playing naturally like we
back then when we didn't have any ranges
and it was it was just a only fun game
and people were trying their best with
their knowledge
and it was fair fight back then like if

[1:42:00]
and it was fair fight back then like if
you know what I mean that was the best
time I I think it was super
fun what made it so fun was it just the
the rollness the strategy trying to
exploit your opponents in the kind of
fair
fight yeah I mean you could play on any

[1:42:16]
fight yeah I mean you could play on any
style and anyone didn't know is that
right or wrong and was that plus if
EV move or anything like everyone played
with a different strategy and yeah

[1:42:30]
with a different strategy and yeah
somehow we ended up here but yeah it was
fun how did you come up with your
strategies back then I'm thinking myself
when I was trying with no alvz we were
kind of using the the best player in
that level to kind of replicate oh he's
doing good so that must be a good move

[1:42:45]
doing good so that must be a good move
and that must be a a winning move how
are you deciphering for yourself what
was your good strategy as you're kind of
freestyling
uh yeah I remember a few regulars who
will uh I mean they didn't F ever to my

[1:43:02]
will uh I mean they didn't F ever to my
CET at some point and I was wondering
why what what does they have because
they are calling and I always had air on
the turn I checked and they B bet every
time and I fed and I was like hm that's

[1:43:17]
time and I fed and I was like hm that's
happening too often and I was leaking
money to them and I realized I I maybe
should float as well like they do on
against me and yeah it was pretty

[1:43:31]
against me and yeah it was pretty
funny yeah it was a lot of like picking
up moves from like certain players oh
that kind of worked maybe I can add that
to my game that put me in a lot of
trouble there maybe I can put other
players in that kind of trouble and like
thinking like through the the strategy
from like a a first principal's

[1:43:45]
from like a a first principal's
perspective of what am I trying to
achieve here what happens when I do this
and if he does that how does my range
respond and you kind of figure it out
piece by piece and picking up mov along
the way and over time you develop your
little tool kit that works for a period
of time you're like ah got this game
solved and someone else comes out with

[1:44:00]
solved and someone else comes out with
some other stuff and you're like got to
read my toolkit now to to level up yeah
so I'm wondering for you what's been the
best investment you have made in your
Pok career I'm guessing taking money out
for your bankroll you've invested things
away from the tables but I'm also
guessing you've made Investments towards

[1:44:15]
guessing you've made Investments towards
your poort career as well so what has
been the the best investment that stands
out for your PO career well of course
holding manager
at start I mean I started with pocket
tracker if I'm correct yeah all the
softwares of course then

[1:44:31]
softwares of course then
[Music]
some video curses like run it once at
some point Lego poer was a big changer
for for me like when there was the guy

[1:44:46]
for for me like when there was the guy
called Briny raid J renr do you do you
know that yeah I know I watched I
watched I watched my first sh of Lego
poker card Runners Deuces cracked blue
fire man watch them all yeah

[1:45:01]
fire man watch them all yeah
that's was uh I think a card Runner you
had what was his name Daniel Benefield I
think it was his name ah yeah yeah had
he had the reptor bat do you remember
that yeah yeahor from was like his
nickname was rtor and he would just

[1:45:15]
nickname was rtor and he would just
three betat everyone in position with
like an insane white range and then
would follow it up with the Raptor bat
which is like you know small oneir one
one one quarter bought seat he was
definitely had of the curve
man yeah I was playing too tight at

[1:45:30]
man yeah I was playing too tight at
first at six Max when I when I started
to learn learning
correctly back then and when I saw Briny
ra videos he was playing like 40 V VP I

[1:45:45]
ra videos he was playing like 40 V VP I
and like owning everyone and I was like
hm maybe I will try that also and don't
forget open shoving always the last hand
of the video do you remember that he
would always Last Hand of the video
under the gun he would open shove before

[1:46:00]
under the gun he would open shove before
the video yeah when you said yeah yeah
yeah keeps the keeps the viewers engaged
waiting for that last that last
hand yeah so for you you mentioned
earlier that you were you didn't use any
softwares super early in your career
when did that shift because it feels

[1:46:15]
when did that shift because it feels
like all the best investments you
mentioned were towards softwares video
courses when did your mindset change
around maybe softwares could be helpful
for your game
um I mean I I've always had the
softwares but I didn't know how to use

[1:46:31]
softwares but I didn't know how to use
them like I didn't check my stats or
anything I just had the uh heart on my
screen and I I had some numbers on there
and I was like H this guy is tight and
this gu is uh aggressive like I I could

[1:46:47]
this gu is uh aggressive like I I could
see all all those stats but I didn't
really
uh check my own results like how how was
my three bet on last month or stuff like

[1:47:01]
my three bet on last month or stuff like
that so I didn't I didn't know how to
use that
probably is that what attracted you to
work with Patrick I know Patrick's known
for his data analysis getting into the
numbers do you feel like that was
something that you uh saw as maybe a big

[1:47:16]
something that you uh saw as maybe a big
leak in your game that you could get
better
at yeah I I took the next step to my
game yeah it's definitely true Patrick
helped a
lot for players who uh maybe are a
little bit AV to numbers and get into

[1:47:32]
little bit AV to numbers and get into
Data you've been on both sides the co is
very interesting from your perspective
how do you feel like they can navigate
in the current poker climate by this I
mean players that are using solvers
using a lot of data can players who are

[1:47:45]
using a lot of data can players who are
maybe a bit Avers to get into the
numbers can they still compete with the
guys who use lot data or is has there
been a tip and point where there's no
option but to to join the data
crowd well I'm still really bad at data
like I try to learn him but it's

[1:48:03]
like I try to learn him but it's
basically against my nature because I I
I like to play more 10 study things like
I like to see what happens when I do
that and you know I'm just pushing

[1:48:16]
that and you know I'm just pushing
buttons basically and yeah sometimes I I
look up on the data but yeah it's rare
it sounds like you're someone who likes
to uh see that kind of cause effect
relationship if I do this what's my
opponent going to do so for you you also

[1:48:31]
opponent going to do so for you you also
mentioned earlier like writing notes and
labels and I'm guess keep tags as well
I'm curious for you like 15 years of
taking notes it can get pretty messy if
you haven't got a system do you have any
sort of like kind of loose system of how
you uh tag players how you take notes or

[1:48:45]
you uh tag players how you take notes or
do you just like Freestyle brandom
anything that comes to mind in terms of
your how you go about organizing or
keeping notes as you're playing yeah
it's a pretty big leak to write essays
to to notes like actually my friend

[1:49:00]
to to notes like actually my friend
friend of mine does that he writes
stories on the notes and if you if you
are playing six to 12 tables you you
don't have time to read that story so
you have to keep that as simple as
possible like but but my sometimes I I

[1:49:17]
possible like but but my sometimes I I
do that myself but but I try to avoid
that because it's not really helpful
when you are
playing give us an example of a common
note you might write on a player any
example that comes to mind that you

[1:49:30]
example that comes to mind that you
could use well this is passive likes to
call or likes to fault and pretty
aggressive that's
yeah yeah you're trying to get as simple
as possible yeah yeah yeah that's the

[1:49:46]
as possible yeah yeah yeah that's the
thing is trying to give you like a
direction to go with your strategy based
on what you picked up on I Pi my first
year playing Pok I played heads up
sitting goes and I played one table I us
SP massive on my laptop full screen U
heads up sitting go so it's a quite a
fast structure and I used to write every

[1:50:01]
fast structure and I used to write every
single hand down like every hand like
even if it wasn't a showdown folded this
one and I used to try and guess cuz I
have hood for the first first year and
yeah I used it was so funny by after a
year I was like all these notes are
completely and utterly useless so I
remember clearing all my notes and going
how should I actually take notes and

[1:50:15]
how should I actually take notes and
then re reevaluate and how to uh think
of what I would need in a hand what
would give me information that I could
use on a player see I was just asking
for you because I know you've took a lot
of notes in your career so I'm guessing
you've um simplified most likely rather
than not too complicated yeah yeah what

[1:50:30]
than not too complicated yeah yeah what
is your definition of
success
H well this might be a cliche but when
you can do what you like to do as living
maybe maybe that's success for

[1:50:47]
maybe maybe that's success for
me money would be boring answer so
maybe maybe when you can can do what you
really like to do as living for living I
mean that's success for

[1:51:01]
mean that's success for
me when did you feel like you were
achieving your version of success when
did you feel like you were doing what
you like or
11 um when I was 15 and I was playing
Counter Strike as professional and I

[1:51:17]
Counter Strike as professional and I
quit school school I was thinking this
is this is life I want to want to be
living
so that was cool back then that's
amazing to at that young of an age to
kind of go your own path and feel feel

[1:51:32]
kind of go your own path and feel feel
like your your vision of success of like
kind of stepping into I'm going my own
path I don't think it's one of those
unless you've done it unless you've done
a career where you choose what you're
going to do and you've been very
thoughtful and went with your interests
I think most people who haven't W the

[1:51:45]
I think most people who haven't W the
poker or other games or Sports can't
really relate to what it feels like to
go I'm doing it my way and I'm going to
live and die by my own sword and how
that feels so yeah I can relate to uh
how that feels as well so for you in
terms
of your greatest contributor to success
what do you feel like that's been and

[1:52:00]
what do you feel like that's been and
that's a hard question it's been 15
years lots of things but I'm trying to
figure out the core trait of you that
have allowed you to uh reach the high
stakes in po what do you feel like some
things that come to mind that have
helped you to go from bottom Stakes to
high stakes what are some of the
greatest contributors in terms of maybe

[1:52:16]
greatest contributors in terms of maybe
character traits for
you um I don't know maybe
All The Comebacks when you have to move
down to stakes and you grind grind it up
again and that that's happened so so

[1:52:32]
again and that that's happened so so
many times for me and many players would
just quit at that point and if your ego
is on your way it's impossible like
impossible to do and you have to be

[1:52:45]
impossible to do and you have to be
humble when you do that and
yeah how do you install that humility to
uh to deal with those crashes I tried to
map out your kind of career in kind of
highs and lows and I did basically an up
a big crash down then an up again then a

[1:53:00]
a big crash down then an up again then a
big crash down then up again and those
crashes would have been almost final for
most people so why do you feel like in
those moments you were able to uh get
through them what is the kind of the key
to uh keep going through those hard

[1:53:15]
times Well
usually I need to take a break for maybe
week or two or three or four weeks maybe
and and I have to make a plan how to

[1:53:30]
and and I have to make a plan how to
what I'm going to do next and do I need
to move up U move move down the stakes
and you know and make a plan and execute
that and yeah it will turn out
well when you make your plan how do you

[1:53:46]
well when you make your plan how do you
approach that that's say maybe the the
second down swing so you've you've went
to PLO lost a lot of your role you're
coming back to no limit you're starting
to play and go wait a second these guys
are actually good again we have to go
back to the low stakes tell us for like
how uh how that planning process went do
you go into the woods somewhere and

[1:54:01]
you go into the woods somewhere and
write a little Journal do you are you
mapping it out on your computer for like
how you plan
stuff
well that happened uh I I counted my
bank roll how much I had money left

[1:54:18]
bank roll how much I had money left
and and I I decided what Stakes do I
have to play now and when I reach out
the number X buying for the next stake I

[1:54:30]
the number X buying for the next stake I
will move up again
and yeah it it takes time but it's worth
it so very calculated plan in terms of
what the next checkpoints are in terms
of building your bank roll then which
levels you play and like kind of
step-by-step process in terms of mindset

[1:54:47]
step-by-step process in terms of mindset
how did you deal with the maybe the ego
side is probably a good thing to touch
on because I think from a planet
perspective there's like a very logical
side where it's like okay cool here I am
I will just build my role again Get Next
Level sounds easy but in reality is like

[1:55:01]
Level sounds easy but in reality is like
you're now having to deal with the fact
that your layers removed from where you
were five years ago or three years ago
the money you had is now gone the game
you are learning is now tougher than it
was these things aren't as easy as just
write a plan together because now you're
dealing with maybe a bit of self-doubt

[1:55:16]
dealing with maybe a bit of self-doubt
also the kind of feeling of not being
where you want to be so how are you
wrestling the the mental aspects in
terms of the ego Maybe feeling a bit
frustrated during this
period yeah it's easier to
say because it's really tough when you

[1:55:31]
say because it's really tough when you
like when when you have played the big
the big games it's hard to move down but
there's no magic tricks on doing like
it's the only only thing you can really
do on that point it's there's

[1:55:47]
do on that point it's there's
no yeah it's it's the only thing you you
can do on that point
so did you ever become like disengaged
or think about quitting when you had to
play lower I'm just thinking let's say
you're playing 5Ks and now you got to

[1:56:00]
you're playing 5Ks and now you got to
grind out 100l I can imagine there's a
feeling of like what am I doing like
what like I can't even get myself to
want to beat this game anymore because I
played so much higher do you ever have
that
experience well maybe I remember when I
told my parents I can manage so I I had

[1:56:17]
told my parents I can manage so I I had
to grind from the small Stakes again my
bank roll and
yeah I decided to go on that
way you said you believe that anyone can
achieve success to get high achieve

[1:56:31]
achieve success to get high achieve
success they put time and energy into it
do you believe that anyone can get to
high stakes let just say will'll filter
out the world population let's say a
professional poker player he at least
playing 50nl do you feel like any player
who's got to to that level could make

[1:56:46]
who's got to to that level could make
the Gap in the bridge to high
stakes yeah I believe so it is he likes
to study
and and playing and it's it's possible
for everyone for

[1:57:00]
for everyone for
sure now because because uh it's because
the software nowadays GD res for example
is really useful and you can basically
learn everything on that so why wouldn't
it be

[1:57:16]
it be
possible back back back then when when
you didn't have any
softwares uh I would say it wasn't
possible for everyone but nowadays when
you have all the tools it's it's
possible for
sure it's interesting because it can

[1:57:31]
sure it's interesting because it can
seem like it's more competitive than
ever and maybe harder to get the top but
at the same time the tools and the
things available allow the path to be
kind of mapped out if you want it to be
and there is like a you can get there
with enough time and energy but there's
also another thousand 10,000 people who

[1:57:46]
also another thousand 10,000 people who
can also get there with the same kind of
tools it's like a it's one of those kind
of um yeah
the word for it but it's one of those
situations where it doesn't feel like
there's it feels like harder but also
easy at the same time which is a a tough
thing to wrestle with yeah of course

[1:58:00]
thing to wrestle with yeah of course
it's not it's easy to reach out to the
highest levels but it's a hard way and
and yeah everyone can do that if you had
to start again with your Pok career
today let's say you hadn't played poker
and you just just stumbled across it

[1:58:15]
and you just just stumbled across it
similar to what you did 15 years ago do
you feel like with the new way pocket
setup with the kind of solvers and du to
wizard Style do you feel like you would
still be drawn to the game and want to
start your career in poker or would you
move away from
it maybe I would I would start over

[1:58:32]
it maybe I would I would start over
again I
mean I still like poker so so why
not MH if you didn't play poker what
would you
do maybe I would be a Counter Strike

[1:58:47]
do maybe I would be a Counter Strike
coach or something or adviser I'm not
sure
let's take counter St off the table what
what's what what would else would you do
if you couldn't choose the past life or
the current
life maybe I would be a chef or

[1:59:01]
life maybe I would be a chef or
something yeah I
think I like making food okay what is
about making food that appeals to you
anything about it that you enjoy
particularly I don't know it's like

[1:59:16]
particularly I don't know it's like
doing something with your own hands and
you don't have
to communicate any you can you can just
do what you like to do and it's
so I
mean yeah it's

[1:59:31]
mean yeah it's
fun what would you say is the biggest
thing you've had to improve on in your
PO career say think look at you now and
look at you as a 20-year-old your 20-y
old self what do you think is the
biggest gap between that person if you
met yourself at 20 you met yourself now

[1:59:45]
met yourself at 20 you met yourself now
they shook hands with each other and got
to know each other what would be the
biggest difference of that all the self
M many many things have changed between
that time
like nowadays I can table select and

[2:00:02]
like nowadays I can table select and
maybe being more wiser on on those
things
and
yeah I don't
know I I would say table table table
selecting is the m main changer here any

[2:00:18]
selecting is the m main changer here any
of the wisdom you passed down to your
younger self
um you don't have to play
against every everyone you can choose
who are you were

[2:00:31]
who are you were
playing when you were playing everyone
was that just out of being a bit naive
to game selecting or did you have like a
uh bit of a point to prove you wanted to
play the best players because you did
mention as well you had a bit of a
disain towards the bum Hunters you
didn't really like those kind of guys so

[2:00:45]
didn't really like those kind of guys so
for you to play in the best players
represents a success or a milestone I'm
getting good at this game
yeah maybe I I liked the challenge to
play as tough opponents which I could
found on on that time so and I think

[2:01:02]
found on on that time so and I think
that's that had a really big aspect on
my own game as well because I had to
play against best players after that
when I played against weager players
they felt so easy to play like even it's

[2:01:16]
they felt so easy to play like even it's
nowadays the same thing when you when
you are playing with the best best
opponents and you go play your smaller
Stakes it feels so much easier to
play yeah I was going to ask was there

[2:01:30]
play yeah I was going to ask was there
an upside to that as you mentioned it
sounds like there definitely was in
terms of when you play anyone else that
feels like an easier game um do you feel
like other
players play as many tough lineups as
you used to do you feel like it's still
a common thing I know there's certain
players who like to WR battle a lot um

[2:01:45]
players who like to WR battle a lot um
I'm guessing they probably know about
game selection if they wanted to do you
feel like looking at the poke a
landscape to other players do you feel
like got on your path of just sitting T
lineups a lot uh I don't think it's not
the thing maybe anymore because you can
study like with the softwares

[2:02:02]
study like with the softwares
like I don't think people are not doing
that anymore maybe maybe some the super
top guys are doing that but on average I
I don't think people are doing that yeah

[2:02:15]
I don't think people are doing that yeah
I was curious you mentioned that with
Counter Strike you uh you were doing a
lot of traveling but when I looked up on
your hand them up I saw basically no no
caches whatsoever uh do have you one
cash one cash okay sorry don't wna month

[2:02:31]
cash one cash okay sorry don't wna month
ago month ago don't want to take away
this uh this glorious moment
uh what have you never really traveled
for for poker and if so what uh made you
not travel for poker since it seemed to

[2:02:45]
not travel for poker since it seemed to
be something that you were liking when
you were uh playing
cstrike um
well I I used to travel more like 10
years ago on going some EPS but
obviously I didn't Su success that much

[2:03:03]
obviously I didn't Su success that much
on those trips I mean those
were
like seeing French basically and playing
poker on on the side
but those trips weren't so so uh that

[2:03:18]
but those trips weren't so so uh that
serious at the
time online poker um has seen a lot of
changes over the years there's obviously
been a lot of threats various programs
being released you know we talked a

[2:03:30]
being released you know we talked a
little bit about seeding scripts you
talked about holder manager uh we have
studying MDA we have solvers Etc also
obviously the threat of cheating RTA
Bots collusion Etc how did online poker
survive and how does the future of

[2:03:47]
survive and how does the future of
online poker look like in your opinion
yeah I mean recently I've played against
some RTA guys and on the sides which are

[2:04:01]
some RTA guys and on the sides which are
not uh investigating like at all on
those things so that's that looks really
bad at this point but the biggest sites
are I think they are doing really good
job on on their security but the smaller

[2:04:17]
job on on their security but the smaller
sites should should do more work on that
I think
I actually saw one uh one future I think
it was ACR that implemented it I only
run run across it yesterday I was there
was like an icon at the table I was like

[2:04:31]
was like an icon at the table I was like
what does icon mean but basically when
you fold your cards shovel back in the
deck so people cannot collude I thought
it was pretty pretty good I think
they're doing it they introduced it for
om because om is obviously most
sensitive to colluding and card sharing

[2:04:46]
sensitive to colluding and card sharing
and [ __ ] but obviously if you fault if
you just put those hands and reshuffle
them in the deck there's no information
right yeah thought was a pretty good
solution actually yeah yeah yeah makes
sense um what would you like the main

[2:05:01]
sense um what would you like the main
takeaway for our audience to be of the
conversation we had
today study hard and table select is my
is
my advice to younger players you don't

[2:05:16]
my advice to younger players you don't
have to play against any everyone at
least the best heads up players
at at your six great episode that was
thank you Samu for sharing your
experience over those 15 years of

[2:05:30]
experience over those 15 years of
playing online poker with us Adam any
main
takeaways yeah for me there was two
interesting chapters of his career one
was where he bought the apartment and he
went from playing 2ks and 5Ks to playing
100 200l in the time where he took that

[2:05:47]
100 200l in the time where he took that
kind of break to play P again lost most
of his bankr had to start from scratch
the these were kind of spread out over
the course of like six different six
years but each time he had to kind of
rebuild his role and that's quite
challenging from an ego perspective just
to uh to go back to grinding it out he

[2:06:01]
to uh to go back to grinding it out he
mentioned that his process was to uh
create a plan and just how am I going to
get that next level and just get back
into it I think a lot of people might
struggle to uh just have that kind of
resilience but also like the less of it
the ego side just go right I'm playing

[2:06:15]
the ego side just go right I'm playing
lower and this is what it's going to
take to get to the next level and I'm
committed and I think what helped with
that was this kind of strong goal that
was always to play the highest stakes in
the game he mentioned that he always
feels like he's climbing the mountain
that he's still not there yet he's 15
years in and he still climbed the

[2:06:30]
years in and he still climbed the
mountain and for me it reinforced the uh
the power of having an overarching goal
that is so big and so far in the future
that it can drive action for 15 plus
years and that's a game because we want
to play um long-term games we want to
play like infinite games that almost
don't end and to do that we need a goal

[2:06:46]
don't end and to do that we need a goal
that we can't reach quickly so if the
goal is get 100K if the goal is to uh
create some Freedom we can get to those
goals a lot quicker to play the highest
Stakes by his definition is a much
harder goal to get to and even now he
still feels motivated to do it so the

[2:07:01]
still feels motivated to do it so the
yeah it's very important to get a goal
that you can resonate with h which I
thought was really key for him another
one is adaptability you don't play 15
years in a game that's moving fast
without the ability to adapt to times so
this is again when things came out and
we talk about stuff like quite quickly

[2:07:15]
we talk about stuff like quite quickly
but there might have been like long
periods at years of Sam's career where
he struggled wasn't making money the
games are getting tough good players are
coming out St coming out and he's having
to go right like what do I do how do I
everyone's coming to my my world and
throwing it upside down how do I adapt

[2:07:30]
throwing it upside down how do I adapt
to it but he's obviously every time
found a way to not only survive in that
climate but actually progress and he's
got to play higher and higher as his
careers went on so yeah I think the
ability to uh adapt to the current
climate has been a bit of a superpow for

[2:07:45]
climate has been a bit of a superpow for
him and another one I wrote down is
resilience like resilience to again goes
in line with those two down periods but
to uh be tough enough just go right
whatever it takes I'm just going to keep
showing up and keep yeah keep building
my role so yeah those are the main ones
I think there's a 15 years of wisdom

[2:08:00]
I think there's a 15 years of wisdom
there in terms of his story and yeah
hopefully we we captured it for the for
the audience how about you R what were
the main ones for
you uh when I asked him like uh because
you mentioned in the this goal right he
always want to play higher when I asked
him like well what do you have to
improve and he said I'm not going to
review all my leaks obviously on the

[2:08:15]
review all my leaks obviously on the
podcast which you know makes makes a lot
of sense but he did then give an Insight
in terms of how he would go about
proving in order to get there right and
many players are very motivated to study
but they often lack like a good system
and he did give some insights uh which

[2:08:30]
and he did give some insights uh which
is actually very similar to the ones
that I would apply basically the first
thing you always have to do is you have
to GA data on the hands that you're
playing and you have to analyze that
data for leaks and a leak the definition
of a leak would be any deviation from
theory that is not deliberate and plays

[2:08:46]
theory that is not deliberate and plays
into a weakness of the population on
average or let's say opponents you play
against on a frequent basis and then
from there when she spotted for example
I think we gave the example of oh you're
over folding BVB versus a small cat go
to GTO wizard shout out GTO wizard set

to GTO wizard shout out GTO wizard set
up a drill we Face a one through cat you
know even with like maybe the bottom
part of your range you can even say that
let's say you have fourth pair or lower
and see which defense you're missing
that and how they play on a later Street
and you just drill them in the end you

[2:09:15]
and you just drill them in the end you
get better with experience so I think
League finding helps you point out what
you need to improve and then with the
drilling you can actually improve and
then when you play sessions always very
important in my opinion we talked a
little bit about autop piloting I think
a good way to prevent autop pilent thing
is to go in with a

[2:09:31]
is to go in with a
session uh and use it as a place where
you can put into practice what you've
learned so you always want to play a
deliberate session that's serving a
greater purpose in his case to reach you
know reach the highest stes in your case

[2:09:46]
know reach the highest stes in your case
it can be to reach a certain goal so I
always ask myself how can I approach a
session in a way that it can help me
achieve my long-term goal right and
that's probably then to have your leaks
top of mind and try to improve on them
if you do that consistently you will
improve at poker and reach the higher

[2:10:01]
improve at poker and reach the higher
Stakes as he said it right he believes
that everyone can make it as long as you
you he said he basically said you have
to study and play but obviously you know
study correctly study he said study hard
I would say more study smart it's

[2:10:15]
I would say more study smart it's
usually people know the tools but it's
how how to use the tools that kind of
stops them um we talked also a lot about
uh thinking practical and think about
the cause effect relationship so in
solvers is easy to go down the rabbit

[2:10:30]
solvers is easy to go down the rabbit
hole and only think about solvers what
does solver do but in the end it's all
cause effect relationship if you start
no looking solver and if you change the
response or if you change something in
the variables you will see the actual
more practical strategy that's going to
be a high CV and he shared some stories
about earli in his career well no one

[2:10:46]
about earli in his career well no one
forb bluffed so the cause effect
relationship right now is I will just
three B 100% right or oh nobody protects
their checking ranges so when they check
I step 100% And when they bet they're
probably is strong so I do over folding
there easy like cause effect

[2:11:01]
there easy like cause effect
relationships and ways of thinking about
the game that old school players have
trained and I would say the good new
school players they understand that as
well right that's I think it's mainly
the people that are stuck at lower
Stakes mid Stakes but are using all
these tools they need to adapt more this

[2:11:16]
these tools they need to adapt more this
type of thinking and last I think this
is something that he kept on coming back
to games selecting right you don't have
to just hop in all players He also
mentioned about reducing his table count
that that really helped in general this
is more in the realm of like managing

[2:11:30]
is more in the realm of like managing
and optimizing your owly I would say
because what you're trying to do when
you play try to constantly optimize your
owe right sometimes adding a table or
removing a table or or exchanging a
table for a different table all to
optimize your hourly also taking
consideration how long you're going to

[2:11:45]
consideration how long you're going to
play for example my table selection
would be different if I have a
three-hour section compared to a 6our
hour session planned right I don't want
to waste all my energy on a shitty game
in my first hour even planning to play
six hours but if I'm only going to play
one hour for example my game selection

[2:12:01]
one hour for example my game selection
would way look way different something
to uh take in consideration all right I
