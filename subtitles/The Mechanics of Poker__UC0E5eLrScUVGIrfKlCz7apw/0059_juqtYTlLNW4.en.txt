if you would have played any hand any
differently or if you have any tips
for any of these players playing at
these games so without further ado
let's continue the action kevin comes in
for a race under the gun
limitless is defending king jack eight
kevin comes in for a one a quarter
pop c bet
limitless calls turn 10 quite
interesting
it's quite a funky turn spot and
interesting spot to take a look at the
solver
there's a couple of cool concepts in
here to
learn from so that would be my
suggestion look this spot up in the
solver
and kind of look what it does and kevin
probably also realized that like oh this
is one of these funky spots there's a
lot of stuff going on
and he thought about for a little while
and did end up deciding to check
now it's up to limitless
who checks as well
and now it's up to kevin who again
thinks about it for
quite a while before deciding to throw
out
a bet and now it's up to
limitless don't think
uh i think limitless is the person who
probably has most flushes i think if
kevin had
a good king with spades it's likely that
he would have barreled the turn let's
say as king queen of spades ace king of
spades
king nine of spades king eight of spades
king
seven of spades i guess could be a hand
that he could be checking
uh well i think limitless has any king
excess baits
same with the ace excess plates i think
kevin could be barreling that himself
kind of as
a bluff putting some pressure on a tent
or a jack or
uh just a random king let's say he has a
like king five and phases in barrel
he's probably not very happy uh ace
queen
is definitely still an option for
limitless where i think kevin would just
always barrel that
um but kevin could definitely still play
maybe a two pair like this he could
still have a hand like
a set but i think it's unlikely i think
i think
kevin's most likely range is
a hand like king queen
with a spade is king maybe but i think
ace king is a bit more likely to barrel
uh asus also a bit more likely to barrel
so i would say like two pair
maybe a bluff
and limitless now goes in for the race
and this is actually also a spot that we
had discussed in the river check race
in video so if you haven't seen that
long go check that out
and this is one of these capped
scenarios where kevin took a patrick
bedline
where it's more likely that he would
just barrel his strong hands on the turn
mainly his flush draws mainly his ace
queens
and it's very likely that limitless
still has these holdings
so it's a spot where limitless can wrap
strong hands that kevin probably doesn't
have so usually also a good spot
to implement some bluffs i think most
likely type of bluffing candidates then
would be a hand like the first hand that
comes up in my mind is maybe hand like
ace jack
with the ace of spades h10 with the ace
of spades
these type of hands would be good
bluffing
candidates i was thinking maybe a hand
with
the king of spades but as we talked
about i think it's more likely that
kevin would barrel that
um that would be then and like king of
spades with a nine
maybe blocking the ace of spade ages
page would be interesting but as we also
talked about i think it's likely that
kevin would barrel that as well
so it's a funky spot
and again it really depends on if you
think your opponent
is more likely to find the bluffing
candidates at a high frequency or at a
low frequency and based on that
make your decision okay again also for
kevin there isn't
basically most hands in kevin's range
here will be
bluff catchers okay so it doesn't really
matter if you have one pair or two pair
you could even make an argument that
happens for example king queen here is
better than having jack 10
because with king queen at least we're
blocking a straight
and with jack 10 we are blocking hands
that villain can be bluffing with as we
just discussed the ace jack and that is
tense
okay even a set here i think they're all
bluff catchers
um so the correct thing to do here in
theory
uh i would say call with a hand like
king queen with a spade at the highest
frequency
and then the rest basically they're all
bluff catchers
[Music]
and then you could call them with a
certain frequency if you want to play
correct
kevin thinks about for quite a while
while end up folding mr limitless takes
it down
[Music]
we have here look opening under the gun
we get a call from kevin in the small
blind they're a little bit deeper and
the race size is quite small so i like
to definitely have some culture if i'm
kevin
my face is squeezed from constantine in
the big blind
look things about for a little while and
calls
constantine now is
going to be c betting and
this is straight away
also looking ahead it's gonna be quite a
tough spot for luke
as it's not very likely that luke will
have sixes as there's already two sixes
on the board
it's also not very likely that luke has
nine since there's already two nines on
the board
and constantine just has the range
advantage in the stronger over pairs
so from that range advantage he can
apply quite a lot of pressure on
luke but i think
looking at the pod outs luke has to pay
3.5 to win 14
he's very obligated to still call with a
lot of his personal on the flop
especially because they can also turn a
straight draw with it or sometimes a
flush draw with it let's say for example
event like sevens with a heart
you know like now we turn in three of
hearts we turn a flush drawer with it we
sell
outs to a boat we if the turns in eight
to ten or five
would make a straight draw so given the
pot outs we still have to continue
quite frequently consistent checks
and now it's up to luke and i expect
luke to do
quite some small betting here
with a very big part of his range
things well for a little while and does
end up indeed going for that small
bet and now it's up to constantine
who decides to go for a little 3x check
race i really like this play
um i think it puts quite a lot of
pressure again on luke's range as we had
concluded
it's not very likely that luke has a lot
of strong hands
maybe he would have turned some flushes
but let's say you're constantine and you
have
ace king with ace of hearts or something
i think this is a very good play
this is just very unlikely that luke has
a strong hand
it's as simple as that and if someone
doesn't have a lot of strong hands and
you apply a lot of pressure
usually they're in a tough spot okay
and it did get true so constantine wins
there a nice little pot
mr 88 opens under the gun constantine
calls constantine is on fire
88 checks four five seven plays a small
bat
from constantine ada check out the flop
and now decides to pull out and this is
already where we can kind of see that
we're dealing with a recreational this
is a very funky line
it's not really a spot you want to be
leading out usually you want to
take over the betting lead when a card
comes in which
improves your range more significantly
than the other
and i think here that's not really the
case
okay so it's a little bit of a funky bat
and constantine
it's reevaluating a situation also
important if you see recreationals do
this kind of stuff it's important to try
to figure out what it means
okay usually there's definitely some
tells to be
gained and this is also why professional
players
usually kind of try to balance their bad
sizings a little bit more right you see
them use
or maybe even one sizing or if they have
two sizings they thought about how to
split it so they don't give away
actual tells about the strength of their
hand so it's not like
their small bat is always weakened and
their big bet is always strong hands
which sometimes with recreationals that
can definitely be the case
and if you have a piece of information
like that that will definitely boost
your win rate
constantine says listen my buddy you're
full of [ __ ] i'm gonna throw out a
little race
so he does her out of the race and now
it's
up so 80 day does call so apparently
they did check call the flop with a hand
that he could now call
a race with which is quite funky
uh he could have obviously been bluffing
let's say yeah they had like 10 jack
then constantly raised he was like okay
i
have a gutter or maybe he has a draw
like a6 then he tries to take over the
batting lead or hand on h3
i think if 88 had a very strong hand
it's
very likely that he would have re-raised
kind of depending on his tendencies so i
would say 88 he either has a draw
or i think he maybe turned a nine with
ace 9
9 10 9 8 type of holdings
that's what i would probably put in on
so if you're constantine i think this is
a fine spot to go and put quite a lot of
pressure
as i think 888 is unlikely to have much
after calling the turn race he thinks
about it for the long goes in the tank
and he comes up with a very small bat
one quarters so i think this this bat
kind of is
targeting uh can it can mean either way
it can mean that okay i have a very
strong hand
i think you're weak so i'm gonna bet a
small size in that i get a call from a
nine
maybe you do something funky with the
head like 10 jack so at least
it gives the it gives mr ada some room
to do something
um or it's like listen uh
i have air oh and he did actually have
air he shows the bluff
king eight shout out to this guy man i
like this guy
so he he shows the bluff in the face of
88 and this was he probably just thought
okay
it could be that 888 has had like a6 or
h3
i'm just gonna put out a little small
bat and hope he faults okay or maybe he
has an end like each check of spades
or his jacket diamonds so it's a little
bit of an uh
i think you have nothing but i also have
nothing then usually who puts in the
last bat
wins type of situation
kevin opens ep gets a call from our
mexican friend who we actually haven't
really seen much in action
and 88 also decides to call
88 comes out potting and as we just saw
the last part wasn't that strong
would say it was very likely that it was
dry as he
was falling to a one quarters back so
let's take that with us in consideration
when evaluating this hand and now it's
up to kevin kevin
i think is in a spot where
if your heads up it's quite fine to just
call
and let aad do his thing but obviously
if we would now just call
we will allow rodriguez in the pot as
it's a multi-way pot
so i would definitely think that kevin
is inclined
to raise some
stronger hands so like even i would say
hands like ace jack is queen as king
so he does indeed race and 888 snap
calls
and checks
so i think 888 can still have a wide
variety of hands like i said i haven't
never really played with this guy so i
have no clue how he plays but so far
i mean draws are definitely in this
range as we concluded from the last hand
and now it's up to kevin
kevin goes for a 26k bet and i couldn't
even press pause that's how fast mr 88
calls a little bit of a timing tail here
and then also with the bad sizing tail
on the previous hand i think it's very
likely that our friend here is drawing
and maybe kevin also realized that and
decided to pump up the price a little
bit with a slight over bet like hey
if you want to draw out of me you're
going to have to pay for it mr 888
missed 80 day checks and now we're in a
little bit of awkward situation 10k left
in a 77k pot i won't expect to
for 488 to do quite a lot of folding
unless he had
a draw that has nothing a king i flush
draw maybe jack have flush draw
eight seven suited uh so eight high
flush draw
but i think it's just very likely that
88 is gonna have a hand like uh
queen jack don't think he has an ace or
two pair or a straight he would have
thought about that for a little while on
the turn
probably again elected to raise so i
would expect a fault he did indeed fold
kevin even made it a little bit cheaper
he got a 10k while he has ten four
nine dudes left these guys have too much
money they don't care about an extra
five on a dollar
uh and he decided like i'll give you a
little bit of a discount
but 80 days false ass like i said he
probably had nothing and was just
drawing
and actually this is our biggest pot of
the day a little 77k
pot going to kevin don't spend it all in
all in one place sir
and if you do make sure it's a good
place
so with his last 10k 88 decides to raise
the button
and now limitless is going after him and
we have a flop of queen 10
deuce limitless bats half pot
with leaving 888 with a little bit more
than half pot so again this is quite
awkward and don't really know which type
of hands
limitless would do this with i would say
that you either have
a value bat that is strong enough to
just
i mean like he's not going to bad fold i
assume
maybe he this is his bluff with a6 space
or something that could i guess make
sense
uh but i would say that a lot of my
hands want to either just check
and let him do the betting or i just jam
the flop and expect to get
caught
and limitless now puts his putimo in
finally
88 calls and with ace king versus king
jack
actually i think this is one of these
hands uh obviously the benefit of
betting half pot or even smaller is that
you allow 88
to kind of stick around with a hand like
ace eight of
hearts and we're not
he's never gonna fold a hand like this
anyway so it's a
think and well played hand by limitless
very unfortunate for 888
that he hit the flop like this they're
gonna run it twice
but it was not meant to be and limitless
takes in the money and 88 loses his
stack
flawless victory and this is also then
the last hint
of this high stakes real i thought it
was quite interesting
to see i think there were a lot of funky
hands that i thought were quite
interesting
let me know if you want to see more of
these type of videos i'm going to be
reviewing a little bit more
