[46:10]
river, I'm facing a bet only 30 where it

[46:10]
river, I'm facing a bet only 30 where it
should be 34. So, I'm overrealizing 4%

[46:13]
should be 34. So, I'm overrealizing 4%

[46:13]
should be 34. So, I'm overrealizing 4%
equity. So, if we think about that,

well, if I get to the river and I get to

bet that much 26 compared to what should

bet that much 26 compared to what should
be 27. So actually I was opening more

[48:02]
be 27. So actually I was opening more

be 27. So actually I was opening more
and I was getting three bet less. So

[48:04]
and I was getting three bet less. So

and you got them in more often. Right.

[49:10]
and you got them in more often. Right.

and you got them in more often. Right.
Right. And actually I can see that here

like team 10b 100 or more. You need a

[49:32]
like team 10b 100 or more. You need a

[49:32]
like team 10b 100 or more. You need a
certain degree of luck in in in that

[49:34]
certain degree of luck in in in that

[49:34]
certain degree of luck in in in that
area. Actually I was dealt ace king and

[49:36]
area. Actually I was dealt ace king and

[49:36]
area. Actually I was dealt ace king and
queens actually less often. As you can

[49:37]
queens actually less often. As you can

[49:37]
queens actually less often. As you can
see, you should be dealt at roughly 3%

[49:39]
see, you should be dealt at roughly 3%

[49:39]
see, you should be dealt at roughly 3%
and I got dealt at 2.5%. But I won way

[49:42]
and I got dealt at 2.5%. But I won way

[49:42]
and I got dealt at 2.5%. But I won way
more with it. As you can see, my win

[49:45]
more with it. As you can see, my win

[49:45]
more with it. As you can see, my win
rate was 778 instead of 515. And also

[49:48]
rate was 778 instead of 515. And also

[49:48]
rate was 778 instead of 515. And also
just one in general more on showdown. So

[49:50]
just one in general more on showdown. So

[49:50]
just one in general more on showdown. So
they remained good more often and I got

[49:53]
they remained good more often and I got

[49:53]
they remained good more often and I got
them in pre flop and they holded right.

[49:55]
them in pre flop and they holded right.

[49:55]
them in pre flop and they holded right.
So a contributor also what I was

the guy had tense. I lost a lot of my

okay what's going wrong? Well, if you

okay what's going wrong? Well, if you
see that for example when over a short

showdown, I don't win it. Like in the

[50:34]
showdown, I don't win it. Like in the

[50:34]
showdown, I don't win it. Like in the
end, for example, you can see that I

[50:36]
end, for example, you can see that I

[50:36]
end, for example, you can see that I
overperformed with my sets. We can see

[50:37]
overperformed with my sets. We can see

[50:37]
overperformed with my sets. We can see
that in win rate both also when I went

[50:40]
that in win rate both also when I went

[50:40]
that in win rate both also when I went
to showdown, I won way more often than I

[50:42]
to showdown, I won way more often than I

[50:42]
to showdown, I won way more often than I
should, right? 10% more often. So that

[50:45]
should, right? 10% more often. So that

[50:45]
should, right? 10% more often. So that
means that I've been running good. I've

[50:46]
means that I've been running good. I've

[50:46]
means that I've been running good. I've
been flopping sets more often, winning

[50:47]
been flopping sets more often, winning

[50:47]
been flopping sets more often, winning
more because I've also been holding,

[50:50]
more because I've also been holding,

more because I've also been holding,
right? So, there's plenty of things that

[50:53]
right? So, there's plenty of things that

[50:53]
right? So, there's plenty of things that
we can go through. Actually, one that I

this is you can see this. So this is

[53:12]
this is you can see this. So this is
basically my river strategy per bat

[53:14]
basically my river strategy per bat

[53:14]
basically my river strategy per bat
sizing. Uh we can now see how balanced I

[53:16]
sizing. Uh we can now see how balanced I

[53:16]
sizing. Uh we can now see how balanced I
was. So mainly the river bats all in. As

[53:18]
was. So mainly the river bats all in. As

[53:18]
was. So mainly the river bats all in. As
you can see I I betted the river all in

[53:21]
you can see I I betted the river all in

[53:21]
you can see I I betted the river all in
6.3% of the time. should be seven. So I

[53:23]
6.3% of the time. should be seven. So I

[53:23]
6.3% of the time. should be seven. So I
was missing some Owins. How I was

[53:26]
was missing some Owins. How I was

[53:26]
was missing some Owins. How I was
missing mainly the Oins. Let me see how

[53:29]
missing mainly the Oins. Let me see how

[53:29]
missing mainly the Oins. Let me see how
balanced were they. So air and low pair.

[53:32]
balanced were they. So air and low pair.

[53:32]
balanced were they. So air and low pair.
So this is basically how much bluff that

[53:33]
So this is basically how much bluff that

[53:33]
So this is basically how much bluff that
range contained. Right? I was missing 4%

[53:35]
range contained. Right? I was missing 4%

[53:35]
range contained. Right? I was missing 4%
of air but I would had more I was

[53:37]
of air but I would had more I was

[53:37]
of air but I would had more I was
bluffing more Owens with low pair. So

[53:38]
bluffing more Owens with low pair. So

[53:38]
bluffing more Owens with low pair. So
basically I was bluffing at basically

[53:40]
basically I was bluffing at basically

[53:40]
basically I was bluffing at basically
perfect GO frequency. And here we can

[53:43]
perfect GO frequency. And here we can

[53:43]
perfect GO frequency. And here we can
see the success with with this range.

[53:46]
see the success with with this range.

[53:46]
see the success with with this range.
Right. So we bet river O in with air.

[53:48]
Right. So we bet river O in with air.

[53:48]
Right. So we bet river O in with air.
How often was that successful? I'm at

[53:50]
How often was that successful? I'm at

[53:50]
How often was that successful? I'm at
50. I ended up 53. So meaning that I got

[53:53]
50. I ended up 53. So meaning that I got

[53:53]
50. I ended up 53. So meaning that I got
3% less faults of what I should in

[53:55]
3% less faults of what I should in

[53:55]
3% less faults of what I should in
theory. Um whereas over and if we look

[53:59]
theory. Um whereas over and if we look

[53:59]
theory. Um whereas over and if we look
at two pair plus so this is obviously

[54:00]
at two pair plus so this is obviously

[54:00]
at two pair plus so this is obviously
our value we should have got 60% folds

[54:03]
our value we should have got 60% folds

[54:03]
our value we should have got 60% folds
and we got 62. So we got a little bit

[54:05]
and we got 62. So we got a little bit

[54:05]
and we got 62. So we got a little bit
more folds with our two pair in that

[54:07]
more folds with our two pair in that

[54:08]
more folds with our two pair in that
first sample I remember like in in the

[54:10]
first sample I remember like in in the

[54:10]
first sample I remember like in in the
first 15 can I was look at this. Okay,

[54:12]
first 15 can I was look at this. Okay,

[54:12]
first 15 can I was look at this. Okay,
so my conclusion was if I jammo all in

[54:14]
so my conclusion was if I jammo all in

[54:14]
so my conclusion was if I jammo all in
on the river, okay, I play a balanced

[54:16]
on the river, okay, I play a balanced

[54:16]
on the river, okay, I play a balanced
strategy, but my two pair plus I think

[54:19]
strategy, but my two pair plus I think

[54:19]
strategy, but my two pair plus I think
was getting like 85% folds, my and my

[54:22]
was getting like 85% folds, my and my

[54:22]
was getting like 85% folds, my and my
plus my air and low pair, they were

[54:24]
plus my air and low pair, they were

[54:24]
plus my air and low pair, they were
getting like 28% fold. So I was like,

[54:26]
getting like 28% fold. So I was like,

[54:26]
getting like 28% fold. So I was like,
okay, hm. So basically, if I flop a set,

[54:28]
okay, hm. So basically, if I flop a set,

[54:28]
okay, hm. So basically, if I flop a set,
I lose. Prefable win, I'm not winning.

[54:30]
I lose. Prefable win, I'm not winning.

[54:30]
I lose. Prefable win, I'm not winning.

interpret it. It comes more from the way

I usually use my hut. If I see players

turn green, that means they give me the

[58:35]
turn green, that means they give me the

I'll also show you a little bit how I
actually tried to fix this already in

[59:08]
actually tried to fix this already in

[59:08]
actually tried to fix this already in
this challenge and kind of show you like

[59:10]
this challenge and kind of show you like

[59:10]
this challenge and kind of show you like
a little before and after. But we can

[59:12]
a little before and after. But we can

[59:12]
a little before and after. But we can
see for example that in position I have

[59:14]
see for example that in position I have

[59:14]
see for example that in position I have
the tendency to check less strong. So

[59:16]
the tendency to check less strong. So

[59:16]
the tendency to check less strong. So
20% should be correct. Um but I go 16.

[59:19]
20% should be correct. Um but I go 16.

[59:19]
20% should be correct. Um but I go 16.
What that means is if I have a lower

[59:21]
What that means is if I have a lower

[59:21]
What that means is if I have a lower
check back strong that means I I'm value

[59:23]
check back strong that means I I'm value

[59:23]
check back strong that means I I'm value
betting thinner. So I'm going thinner

[59:25]
betting thinner. So I'm going thinner

[59:25]
betting thinner. So I'm going thinner
for value. Now that would be a problem

[59:27]
for value. Now that would be a problem

[59:27]
for value. Now that would be a problem
and kind of I will now show you how kind

[59:29]
and kind of I will now show you how kind

[59:29]
and kind of I will now show you how kind
of all these stats can work together.

[59:31]
of all these stats can work together.

[59:31]
of all these stats can work together.
That would be a problem. So this is a

[59:33]
That would be a problem. So this is a

[59:33]
That would be a problem. So this is a
deviation. So you could say this is a

[59:35]
deviation. So you could say this is a

[59:35]
deviation. So you could say this is a
leak because you're doing something

[59:36]
leak because you're doing something

[59:36]
leak because you're doing something
quote quote wrong. I'm going thinner for

[59:38]
quote quote wrong. I'm going thinner for

[59:38]
quote quote wrong. I'm going thinner for
value. So then the biggest problem that

[59:41]
value. So then the biggest problem that

[59:41]
value. So then the biggest problem that
you have when you go thinner for value

[59:42]
you have when you go thinner for value

[59:42]
you have when you go thinner for value
is that people can race you off. So

[59:43]
is that people can race you off. So

[59:43]
is that people can race you off. So
that's a problem. Here we can see check

[59:45]
that's a problem. Here we can see check

[59:45]
that's a problem. Here we can see check
weak. So I'm actually value getting

[59:47]
weak. So I'm actually value getting

[59:47]
weak. So I'm actually value getting
thinner and I'm bluffing less. So

[59:48]
thinner and I'm bluffing less. So

[59:48]
thinner and I'm bluffing less. So
clearly I feel like that spot is getting

[59:50]
clearly I feel like that spot is getting

[59:50]
clearly I feel like that spot is getting
underfolded. So that's one. So that's

[59:52]
underfolded. So that's one. So that's

[59:52]
underfolded. So that's one. So that's
one assumption that we then we have to

[59:54]
one assumption that we then we have to

[59:54]
one assumption that we then we have to
check right. Is this spot that needs

[59:55]
check right. Is this spot that needs

[59:55]
check right. Is this spot that needs
getting underfolded? And are we not

[59:58]
getting underfolded? And are we not

[59:58]
getting underfolded? And are we not
getting raised or is our uh exploit not

[1:00:01]
getting raised or is our uh exploit not

[1:00:01]
getting raised or is our uh exploit not
getting reexloited? So for that for

[1:00:03]
getting reexloited? So for that for

[1:00:03]
getting reexloited? So for that for

we see that we're betting 47. This is

[1:00:15]
we see that we're betting 47. This is

[1:00:15]
we see that we're betting 47. This is
the success. So we're getting 1% more

[1:00:17]
the success. So we're getting 1% more

[1:00:18]
the success. So we're getting 1% more
success. So the assumption of okay

[1:00:19]
success. So the assumption of okay

So you could say I shouldn't bluff. Now

So you could say I shouldn't bluff. Now
we can then break that down into lines

overfolding I think 3%. Here we're

[1:06:45]
overfolding I think 3%. Here we're

apparently also overfolding 2%. So when

[1:06:48]
apparently also overfolding 2%. So when

[1:06:48]
apparently also overfolding 2%. So when
we're in the big blind and we face a C

[1:06:50]
we're in the big blind and we face a C

[1:06:50]
we're in the big blind and we face a C
bet, we're overfolding 2% on average. We

[1:06:53]
bet, we're overfolding 2% on average. We

[1:06:53]
bet, we're overfolding 2% on average. We
can see here versus one/3 actually

[1:06:55]
can see here versus one/3 actually

[1:06:55]

that's not really the case. We mainly

with me here. Uh, this is actually how

[1:07:23]
with me here. Uh, this is actually how

often we call the flop and then face

[1:07:25]
often we call the flop and then face

often we call the flop and then face
aggression on the turn. So, it says full

[1:07:27]
aggression on the turn. So, it says full

[1:07:27]
aggression on the turn. So, it says full
turn, but this actually face aggression

[1:07:28]
turn, but this actually face aggression

[1:07:28]
turn, but this actually face aggression
on the turn. So, that means that um when

[1:07:33]
on the turn. So, that means that um when

[1:07:33]
on the turn. So, that means that um when
for example after we see about one/3

[1:07:35]
for example after we see about one/3

[1:07:35]
for example after we see about one/3
here, we face aggression on the turn 44%

[1:07:37]
here, we face aggression on the turn 44%

[1:07:38]
here, we face aggression on the turn 44%
instead of 48. So on average that shows

[1:07:40]
instead of 48. So on average that shows

[1:07:40]
instead of 48. So on average that shows
us that we should probably call more

[1:07:42]
us that we should probably call more

[1:07:42]
us that we should probably call more
versus a one- turn bet because on

4% less on the turn whereas compared to
if we bet 60 and 80% for example he's

[1:07:51]
if we bet 60 and 80% for example he's

[1:07:52]
if we bet 60 and 80% for example he's
actually going to barrel 3% more. So

[1:07:54]
actually going to barrel 3% more. So

[1:07:54]
actually going to barrel 3% more. So
then if we go to the specific line again

[1:07:57]
then if we go to the specific line again

[1:07:57]
then if we go to the specific line again
is then overfolding versus this three

quarter is that a good idea? Probably
yes because we're going to face more

[1:10:36]
actually get way more success. So, if we
step flop, that's actually

[1:10:37]
step flop, that's actually

[1:10:37]
step flop, that's actually
outperforming.

[1:10:39]
outperforming.

[1:10:39]
outperforming.
And the next phase is, do we actually

[1:10:41]
And the next phase is, do we actually

[1:10:41]
And the next phase is, do we actually
face raises? We're actually facing a

[1:10:43]
face raises? We're actually facing a

[1:10:43]
face raises? We're actually facing a
flop raised 3% less. So on average

[1:10:45]
flop raised 3% less. So on average

[1:10:45]
flop raised 3% less. So on average
people have not been raising my stab

[1:10:47]
people have not been raising my stab

[1:10:47]
people have not been raising my stab
right. So I'm getting more folds and

[1:10:49]
right. So I'm getting more folds and

[1:10:49]
right. So I'm getting more folds and
less raises which means that I should be

[1:10:50]
less raises which means that I should be

[1:10:50]
less raises which means that I should be
more aggressive myself. Something that
