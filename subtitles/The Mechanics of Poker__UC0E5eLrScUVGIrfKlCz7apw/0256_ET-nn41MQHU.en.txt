[03:35]
All right, chat is working. How about
audio?
I think we should be good or at least

[03:47]
I think we should be good or at least
audio wise.
All right, chat is working. How about
audio?

[04:04]
I think we should be good.
All right, this good

[04:37]
All

[04:49]
right. Now you can also see me.
I my audio a little bit as suggested.

[05:01]
Better now
audio wise.
How are we all doing today? We love you,
Wacka. That's uh that's good to hear.

[05:30]
All right. Great.
So, uh, what we're going to do today is
we're going to take a a deep dive, as
it's stated right in the title, in the
thumbnail, into, uh, into the data that
I gathered on my the hands that I played

[05:46]
I gathered on my the hands that I played
during the Cash World Championship,
40,311
hands. It ended up being
one close to 10 BBB 100, up 20k, and
ended up finishing 11th. Unfortunately,
I couldn't play like the last three or

[06:00]
I couldn't play like the last three or
four days. I think when I quit, I was
like seventh. And in hindsight, I wish I
would have approached it a little bit
different actually from the start
straight away. I kind of, you know, I
hadn't like if you listen back to the

[06:15]
hadn't like if you listen back to the
podcast for example that we did with
some of the competitors, especially you
know the winner, shout out to the winner
Nikita Wars of Flop 45. like when he
heard about the challenge basically a
couple weeks in he was already
scheduling and he was basically making a
plan how to win this thing right whereas
I was like first day I was like oh let's

[06:30]
I was like first day I was like oh let's
check this out a little bit second day
so I took too long to dedicate uh to the
goal and uh yeah I didn't have enough
time to make up for for that delay
basically for really tuning in and and
trying to take this as serious as

[06:46]
trying to take this as serious as
possible. Um, so yeah, that's a bit
unfortunate,
but uh, yeah, welldeserved winner. Um,
obviously you guys only saw kind of
snippets of the full conversation that
we had with him. U, but yeah, overall

[07:00]
we had with him. U, but yeah, overall
definitely deserved winner. Great stuff.
So, what are we going to look at today
is indeed these hands. We're going to be
using um, hand toote our mechanics
league finder popup.
and I will show you guys a tool and how

[07:17]
and I will show you guys a tool and how
to use it. And yeah,
but before we get into all that good
stuff, I want to quickly um ask you guys
a question, which is
how do you guys improve as a poker

[07:34]
how do you guys improve as a poker
player? That's the question that I have
for you guys.
So you can just write it in the chat.

[07:51]
What are some things that you do or
maybe also that you find effective ways
to work on your game, make progress,

[08:01]
to work on your game, make progress,
up your whim rate,
you name it. any area that comes up, any
habit that comes up, any
ritual. Ritual sounds a little bit too
voodoo, but uh I hope you guys get get

[08:15]
voodoo, but uh I hope you guys get get
what I mean.

[08:35]
So, how do you improve as a poker player
videos and play one table focused? So,
you watch videos.

[08:45]
you watch videos.
Hope it's videos of the Wacko. It's a
good source good source of videos. Play
one table focused. So, when you say
focus, you mean your focus on something
specific or how how do you focus? How
does focus actually work? It's actually
quite an interesting topic.

[09:05]
Shim poker says, "Look at the same sim
and bash your head thousand times on the
keyboard until you figure it out." Okay,
that that's that that is a way to do it.
It's probably going to take you a little

[09:15]
It's probably going to take you a little
bit long to reach mastery, but uh get
your pil as a coach. That seems like a
very very GTO way to improve as a poker
player.
Making sure the wine storage gets
refilled on time. How do you improve as

[09:31]
refilled on time. How do you improve as
a poker player? I don't already see the
the link there, but review hands,
identify biggest mistakes, drill those
mistakes, and repeat. H, that's uh I
like it because this shows he didn't say
one thing. He showed a process. And in

[09:46]
one thing. He showed a process. And in
the end, guys, a process for
improvement, you know, doing the same
things, the the most efficient things
over and over again is in the end what's
going to make you a better poker player.
So, I like that from Ramsey Romero. Very
good stuff. He reviews hands and then

[10:00]
good stuff. He reviews hands and then
identifies his biggest mistakes. Then he
drills those mistakes and repeats it.
Watch the full mechanics of podcast
poker poker podcast playlist. I
definitely agree. Make the best
questions to get the best answers.
Understanding the underlying logic, the

[10:15]
Understanding the underlying logic, the
questions creates the frameworks. It's
actually very deep stuff. Uh it's kind
of very in line actually with my
coaching philosophy.
Like I like to to look for the
decision-m process and what someone
considers because usually if we make a

[10:30]
considers because usually if we make a
mistake, it's because we were forgetting
to focus on something or we were focused
on the wrong thing, right? It's usually
the things that we look for. Um that's
where kind of the error occurs. The
things that we take in consideration or
forget to take in consideration. So the
decision-m process up to the mistake.

[10:47]
decision-m process up to the mistake.
Get a slick back hair like yours. It's
my second best guess. That would
definitely improves your win rate as
well. not necessarily at the tables
though. But hey, there's more important
things in life as well because
memorizing every situation is not
possible that I definitely agree with.

[11:02]
possible that I definitely agree with.
I uh I wrote some points here and
actually a lot of points I think have
been mentioned right someone said watch
videos you can watch videos of YouTube
uh you can watch plane explains here I
wrote right I think training sites like

[11:15]
wrote right I think training sites like
run at once you can watch uh yeah some
very good pros also actually free on
YouTube there's plenty of good plane
explains out there um someone already
mentioned GTO wizard joining the
webinars of wacko at GTO wizard someone
said I'm his favorite coach shout out to

[11:31]
said I'm his favorite coach shout out to
you I do my best. So yeah, GTO wizard
definitely a great tool, right? Has
endless possibilities. We can train, we
can can watch sims, we can create
nowadays custom reports, we can solve
multi-way.
Very very important tool. Uh we can

[11:45]
Very very important tool. Uh we can
study MDA, something that if you've been
following the podcast series, Sherry
Sweet mentioned that he was quite big on
as well and that was actually a big big
turnaround point for him. Studying
solvers, we could do hand reviews.
Something that I think it was Romero,
right? Yeah, Ramsey Romero pointed out

[12:01]
right? Yeah, Ramsey Romero pointed out
obviously also very important drills and
trainers also someone said or it
actually was part of the process you can
listen to the mechanism poker podcast
that was also said you can meditate it's
important person you can get a personal
trainer right you can hire coaches
one-on-one coaching it can be either man

[12:16]
one-on-one coaching it can be either man
mental or technical you can binge wackos
content very good you can uh yeah like I
said training site or you can do for
example database analysis right all ways
that uh yeah that you can improve as as
a poker player. Now, you're probably now

[12:32]
a poker player. Now, you're probably now
and this is actually a question that's
that's often been asked like what should
I do, right? What is the most effective
way? Well, to be fair, I think all
points here mentioned, yeah, are are
valuable, right? But how do you how do

[12:45]
valuable, right? But how do you how do
you first prioritize,
right, what works and most importantly,
and that's kind of the point that I'm
that that I want to get to that is not
necessarily what of these things you do,
okay? But it's how you do it. It's how
deliberate you are going about doing it.

[13:01]
deliberate you are going about doing it.
So we can sit in the trainer and drill
like someone said or we can watch we can
look at a solver. Um but it's about how
you use it that's going to determine the
output. I like to always give this
example that some people actually say is
a bad example but I still give it. You

[13:15]
a bad example but I still give it. You
know if you give me the best ingredients
of the world I'm a lousy cook. Uh and
even if with this great ingredients
right and the great the best knives in
the world I still can't cook, right? I
will still make a shitty dish. So, it's
not necessarily the tools that you have

[13:30]
not necessarily the tools that you have
and what you do, but how you use them
that's going to make that's going to
determine the output.
The best way and the place to start if
you want to improve as a poker player,
right? And in order to become
deliberate,

[13:45]
deliberate,
in order to improve, you must first know
what's holding you back. This is always
the start, right? If you don't know what
your your strengths are, your weaknesses
are, you're just going to uh watch do
all these things very scattered, right?

[14:01]
all these things very scattered, right?
You see a plane, explain, you learn a
little trick, but where does that go in
your complete strategy? And is that
actually one of the most important
things to work on or is that just
another shiny object? Uh, one of the
most uh effective way to do this is with

[14:15]
most uh effective way to do this is with
data. Data is awareness and awareness is
power. It all starts with gaining
clarity. It all starts with awareness.
Any any any road to improvement starts
here. So data analysis is one of the
most effective ways to build awareness

[14:30]
most effective ways to build awareness
nowadays. I think this is quite uh out
there, right? Giving you an unbiased
view of what you are actually doing and
not doing. There's been many of times
that I fall victim to this that I
thought that I was doing something uh
and then I looked at my data and I

[14:46]
and then I looked at my data and I
actually wasn't or the other way around.
And for example, to talk about the
Kashkin World Championship and the
value, for example, I heard actually
plenty of guys who were on the live
stream during the Kashkin World
Championship or that only looked at that
data after the championship is over.

[15:00]
data after the championship is over.
That's that's in my opinion an epic
fill. Okay. I obviously you need if you
want to do a deep analysis like we're
going to do today, you need a little bit
of a bigger sample. I will look at the
40k sample, but I'll also look at a
bigger sample of mine like around 200k
hands from from last year. Um but even

[15:15]
hands from from last year. Um but even
in a week period I would reflect on my
performance in the CAS game world
championship. So, you know, am I
actually doing what uh what I what I set
out that I was going to do? And for
example, one week in, I actually course
corrected a couple of things. I was

[15:30]
corrected a couple of things. I was
like, hey, this isn't this is an
attention point. This has been sneaking
in, you know, and my my in case it was
not being aggressive enough pre flop um
with four bats and squeezes and three
bats, which is a general tendency that
I'm I'm aware of. And uh yeah, like it's

[15:46]
I'm I'm aware of. And uh yeah, like it's
very important to also on the short term
monitor your data to see if you're
actually doing what you set out that
you're doing. Also, I wrote down what is
working versus what isn't. Um this is
actually something that we're going to
dive into as well. Something that I
think se separates what we made apart

[16:02]
think se separates what we made apart
from the rest. So in general, right, why
do we do data database analysis? Well,
it's to raise awareness, gain an
unbiased view of your tendencies. I I
almost like to see it as just a tendency
checker, right? What are your

[16:15]
checker, right? What are your
tendencies? Actually, an unbiased view
and find it very unlikely and surprising
if someone would do that and he would
not find things that he did not expect.
Um, it raises your performance and

[16:30]
Um, it raises your performance and
specifically your BNC game. Okay, if you
do database analysis and you kind of you
might say like, okay, yeah, well, my my
pool, you know, plays different or I
adjust towards my opponents. Sure,
there's plenty of notes where you're
going to make a read in game, right? And
you're going to do something different
than what you would normally do. Uh, but

[16:46]
than what you would normally do. Uh, but
that's usually the exception. So, what
you see in your data and what you see in
your stats, that's kind of your BNC
game. That's how I like to see it. So,
do you have certain tendencies that are
present in your BNC game that just cost
you money in the long term, right?

[17:01]
you money in the long term, right?
Deviations from GTO that are not on
purpose, but simply usually bias driven,
right?
So we're not necessarily with this
process focusing on becoming or raising
our agame. We're trying to solidify the

[17:17]
our agame. We're trying to solidify the
thing that we fall back on, right?
We're trying to increase efficiency
because if we do database analysis and
we figure out what our biggest
weaknesses are, we can now become
deliberate in terms of for example

[17:31]
deliberate in terms of for example
someone mentioned training or you know
looking at the solver instead of just
looking at whatever spot interests us at
that moment uh or where whatever our
attention goes towards because you know
we might feel uncertain about something
we can actually zoom in on that where

[17:46]
we can actually zoom in on that where
we've identified we have the biggest
leaks. So basically what we're trying to
do is become more efficient with our
time. So we can increase our efficiency
by only focusing on what really drives
the highest return.
Something that's very interesting and

[18:00]
Something that's very interesting and
that kind of comes in the later points.
This is kind of more like mental game
focus and engagement sort of extra
benefits or side effects of working on
your game. You'll start to become more
focused and engaged. Someone said uh
playing one table and I'm very focused.

[18:16]
playing one table and I'm very focused.
Focus usually also comes from curiosity
and curiosity comes from being taking a
look at your game and be being curious
for it. So you're enga you will have
better focus. You'll be more engaged and

[18:30]
better focus. You'll be more engaged and
therefore you'll stop autopiloting
because you have new things to work on.
So autopiloting is actually something
that your brain automatically does to
save energy. it spots a repeating task
like playing poker and if you have
nothing to work on if you don't give
your brain anything it will just
identify this as a repeated task and

[18:46]
identify this as a repeated task and
basically it will go into the mode the
same mode that if you would be brushing
your teeth it's done that 100 times so
it's like I don't have to think because
I'm brushing my teeth um so think about
it if you don't go into a poker session
having something to work on your brain
is in the same mode as if you are

[19:00]
is in the same mode as if you are
brushing your teeth you think this is as
good for your poker game probably not so
that's like a little side
side effect of working on your game,
you'll become a sharper and more present
poker player. And actually, this will
actually be way more satisfying. Working

[19:17]
actually be way more satisfying. Working
hard on your game and trying to become
the best version of yourself is actually
way more satisfying than and way more
way easier in a way than it sounds,
right? You might think that it's very
hard to become very good at poker. But

[19:30]
hard to become very good at poker. But
if you have the right system to follow,
then this will actually be quite
enjoyable for you if you know what to
do, right? You're kind of in that flow
channel where you know your skill level
and the challenge, they're they're just
right because you know what to do. And
then what happens is you actually start

[19:46]
then what happens is you actually start
to enjoy working on poker because you
feel in control, right? And I feel like
a lot of players nowadays, they're very
motivated. you know, they want to put
their time into something, but they're
not really sure where to put their time
in, right? And that kind of demotivates
them in a way.

[20:01]
them in a way.
Resilience, uh, you become less
resultoriented. Poker comes with ups and
downs, right? And in the end, it's the
person who shows up most consistently
that will win. Okay? In the end,
longevity and consistency are the skills
that in the end all comes down to. We

[20:16]
that in the end all comes down to. We
could talk about many things, right? But
in the end, the person who shows up
consistently and for the longest. over
let's say a 20 20 20 year period, you
will probably win the most, right? And
how do you do that? By being process
focused. So you're you're focused on the

[20:30]
focused. So you're you're focused on the
process. You're focused on improving
your game, not necessarily make the most
amount of money right now. The money
will be a consequence of you uh working
on your game. All right,
stat checkers. Okay, you've probably

[20:45]
stat checkers. Okay, you've probably
heard about them. Leak finers, stat
checkers. Basically, what we're doing
here is we're going to review data of
hands that you played. And this is, like
I said, the best way place to start if
you want to improve as a poker player.
Hand tootee stat and pop-up packages.
You know, you can buy many, like I said,

[21:01]
You know, you can buy many, like I said,
stat checkers, leak finders, etc.
They're used to review performance, find
leaks and tendencies in your and your
opponent's game. You can also use these
type of tools where you either analyze
your game or you can look at analytic of
your opponent like someone I think in

[21:15]
your opponent like someone I think in
the chat pointed out. uh how do you
study MDA? Well, you can do it basically
with the same tool. That being said,
certain tools are more specifically
weighted towards analyzing your game.
Doesn't mean that they still cannot be
used to analyze your population. Uh but
there is a a small difference there.

[21:31]
there is a a small difference there.
Actually, most tools out there don't
really make a distinction um because
they kind of wanted to be able to be
used for both. But actually there I
think you know by trying to uh trying to
serve both purposes you kind of miss

[21:46]
serve both purposes you kind of miss
excelling in one in my opinion. So what
do these tools allow you to do? Usually
you know they have a stat for every line
in the game tree. You know if you go to
for example the handote store and you
find all these type of uh packages that

[22:00]
find all these type of uh packages that
you can download. One says they have
2,000 stats other one has 5,000 sets.
Other one has 10,000 stats. Uh but
usually what they all do is they break
down every line and spot in the game
tree. You upload your hands and then you
can see your stats, right? Stats are
nothing without a benchmark. So nowadays

[22:16]
nothing without a benchmark. So nowadays
most of these tools they have GTO
benchmarks that you can compare it to,
right? Because in order to identify if
something is good or bad, we need a
benchmark. And the best benchmark that
we can go for is GTO. Now this doesn't
mean that if your stat is higher or
lower that it's a leak per se, right? It

[22:31]
lower that it's a leak per se, right? It
just means it's a deviation from GTO.
And you have to now reflect on that if
that's on purpose, right? And that's why
I said raising awareness. Oh, I deviate
from GTO here. Do I have do I have a
good reason for that? Do I think the
pool is doing X or do I think the pool

[22:45]
pool is doing X or do I think the pool
is doing that? If so, and we we also
check, we can actually also see if
that's indeed effective.
And usually they then also kind of color
code so you can identify straight away,
oh, I'm too high here, I'm too low
there. That's usually what most uh tools
allows you to do. To give you an idea

[23:01]
allows you to do. To give you an idea
about how long I've been working with
this type of uh this type of process, as
you can see here, this is a this is a
photo that I made of a whiteboard that
uh was basically in my office. I shared
an office with three other poker

[23:15]
an office with three other poker
players. And here we can see end of 2016
was a goal. So that's nine years ago.
And basically I did what we now nowadays
we have twos, right? But back then we
did not have as sophisticated tools. So
a whiteboard was my to go to and work

[23:31]
a whiteboard was my to go to and work
like using this process to work on your
game. Like I said something I've been
doing at least since 9 years ago. And
obviously that has evolved right in the
past was just a whiteboard then it
became Excel sheets then it became uh
hand toote then it became GTO benchmark.

[23:45]
hand toote then it became GTO benchmark.
has evolved and so has my approached
right but still it's very very very
efficient right in order also to uh to
see if you've done well by the way I was
a big nit 46 more 41 was a flop shame on
you um but hey we made improvements

[24:00]
you um but hey we made improvements
because we we worked on it deliberately
right we identified it which was step
one like hey my one was a flop is quite
low well what can I do about it let's
break that down um
so yeah now a day so this is kind of
where it for me started And this is

[24:15]
where it for me started And this is
where we currently are. We have the
mechanics leakfinder which is a hand
toote stat and pop-up package. And
they're actually included in our new
program, the leakbuster program. All
right, probably you can see somewhere on
the screen out now. Mechanics leakbuster

[24:30]
the screen out now. Mechanics leakbuster
program info link in description with
this tool. Okay, we take leak finding
tenency checking that's actually more
how I like to to see it as well to a
whole another level. And how do we do
that? Uh like I said earlier, actually

[24:45]
that? Uh like I said earlier, actually
this is the last point, but I want to
kind of start with that. It's not
necessarily more stats, right? U maybe
actually it has more stats, but every
stat that's in our league finder is
there for a reason. And I thought about,
okay, I have years of experience league
finding myself, years of experience

[25:01]
finding myself, years of experience
coaching of hundreds of students. What
do I usually look for? And what are
really important stats that if I see
them make me alter my strategy, right?
So it's not I'm not here saying that
okay well we have more stats than others

[25:15]
okay well we have more stats than others
that's not necessarily uh where the
value is where some of the value is and
that I think are kind of points that are
very different is we focus a lot on
detecting variance so I think a struggle
with a lot of poker players are that
they kind of lose their [ __ ] right they

[25:30]
they kind of lose their [ __ ] right they
either become overconfident when they're
winning too much and they become
underconfident when they're losing too
much actually something that I first uh
made in my CFP like five years ago or
something I Actually, that was I made it
in Excel. Surprise, surprise. You could
basically with all the manage you could

[25:46]
basically with all the manage you could
filter your your win rate stats and for
example, how often you would flop a set,
turn a set, and how how much money you
would make with that. And then basically
in the short term, you could see like,
oh, how much variance was impacted on my
game. So, for example, I know that some

[26:00]
game. So, for example, I know that some
people they don't like to work, for
example, with win rate numbers over
short samples because they're variance
sensitive. But that's actually the whole
point, right? If we have the GTO
benchmark of what a set is supposed to
make in terms of win rate and we saw
that in a month that we did very well,
first of all, we didn't flop a set as

[26:16]
first of all, we didn't flop a set as
often and when we did flop a set, we
actually lost a head way more often and
we have a very negative win rate. We can
at least give a diagnose on the reason
why we've been losing. Same the other
way around to not start thinking that
you're now the best poker player in the
world when you finally had a great

[26:30]
world when you finally had a great
month, right? by uh by thinking okay I'm
the best now when you just saw that your
prefro win rate all in was like four
times what it should be aka you just got
your premiums in very often and you won
right so detecting variance and I will

[26:45]
right so detecting variance and I will
show you this in a second right I played
40k hands during the cash game world
championship so that's obviously a
sample in which variance is going to
play a very big role most probably if we
look at the winner right one was a flop
obviously he played great poker but
probably if we look at for example his
pre flop or win win rate I can almost

[27:01]
pre flop or win win rate I can almost
guarantee to you. And this is usually
what you see if you grab data of bigger
winners over a shorter sample. They
usually outperform massively in pre-flop
points. That's just a very big part of
an upswing, right? Um so this actually
something that's uh that's very

[27:15]
something that's uh that's very
different. Evaluate how your strategies
are performing in game. Now obviously
you can just look at frequencies, but
what we did is and like I said this
comes from a reflecting of okay, what do
I think is important? Seeing how often
something actually works. So think about
success stats. Think about equity

[27:30]
success stats. Think about equity
realization stats. So how often are you
facing aggression? Obviously we can look
at Putin and see oh on average the P
does it this but what about versus you.
So in our in our league finder uh we
will have actualization stats. How often
you face certain aggression? Let's say
for example you call the turn how often

[27:46]
for example you call the turn how often
on average do you face aggression on the
river? Now why is this important? Well
if we know that on average we will face
4% less aggression on the river. We can
actually call turns lighter because we
get to show them more often. Like I
said, every step is in there. Um because
there will be a strategical consequence

[28:01]
there will be a strategical consequence
if it's either too high or too low. And
actually, this is also where I come in,
right, as your coach. Uh I will not just
give you all these things and say, "Hey,
good luck with it." Which is what most
people do. No, I will show you exactly
how to use and interpret the data.

[28:16]
how to use and interpret the data.
Take a sip of water.
frequency is broken broken down in range
composition.
When you see a certain frequency that is
outside of the norm, so outside of the

[28:30]
outside of the norm, so outside of the
benchmark, you can say, "Okay, it's a
high to low." But why? Um we have like
bet size breakdowns, hand class
breakdowns with GTO benchmarks. And this
is very important obviously in hand to
note for the people have used uh a
something like this. You can click on
it, you can see the hands, but you have
again if you have no benchmarks, you

[28:46]
again if you have no benchmarks, you
don't know. Okay, I'm folding middle
pair 36% of the time. Is that good or
bad? I don't know. So what we done is
actually broken down every hand class
with GTO benchmark so you can
immediately which hand class is causing
the the error in frequency. Same with

[29:01]
the the error in frequency. Same with
the bat sizing.
Now not all spots like I said can
actually be benchmarked with GTO. Think
for example multiway limp pots. We
actually also added um population
benchmarks and even stats of like bigger

[29:15]
benchmarks and even stats of like bigger
winners so you can compare your game not
only to GTO but also do that of other
humans. Okay, so this is all great,
right? Like I said, stat checking, leak
finding, however you want to call it,
tendency checking is very important

[29:30]
tendency checking is very important
because it all starts with awareness.
But guys, awareness is not enough. If I
was just here because I had a great
popup and uh and that's the only thing
that I could bring you guys, I would not
be going live. I don't think that is
something that I could contribute to the

[29:45]
something that I could contribute to the
poker community that I think delivers
way more value. uh than there currently
is. Like I said, I do think it's better.
It's more it's uh uh but I don't think
that alone would justify that we are
going live here on YouTube. It's not
it's not necessarily the standard that I

[30:00]
it's not necessarily the standard that I
set because awareness is not enough
because true knowledge is when awareness
survives pressure. A very big confusion
that people have when they do stuff like
this, right? They go to hand to note and
they look at their stats. They think
like, oh yeah, okay, I saw that I'm

[30:16]
like, oh yeah, okay, I saw that I'm
overfolding. So now that I'm aware of
that, you know, I can now go and play
and I will not be overfolding anymore.
No, that that's not how it works. You
became aware, right? But knowing is when
awareness of ice pressure. So when
you're six tableabling in a down swing,
you know, and the spots come up, do you

[30:31]
you know, and the spots come up, do you
revert back to your leaks? And I'm
pretty sure that a lot of people are now
like, "Yeah, I'm aware of a lot of
things, but I cannot help myself,
right?" But they they seem to keep on
coming back and it keeps hindering me
from moving forward. That's the things
that I'm interested in fixing. Okay. But

[30:46]
that I'm interested in fixing. Okay. But
obviously in order to first identify
that we have to go to step one which is
finding the leaks by using um like a
stat checker, leak finder, tendency
checker, however you want to call out,
right? Because these tools they are
great and like say I've used them a lot

[31:00]
great and like say I've used them a lot
but they are actually just the beginning
and it's only the first steps towards
achieving your goals. And this is
actually where most products tools they
give you this and they kind of tell you
well this is it. But this is not it
guys. This is just the first step. I'll

[31:17]
guys. This is just the first step. I'll
show you this in uh in the process that
I've used over many years in my own pok
career taught to a lot of my students. I
usually call it the feedback loop. It
all starts with a goal. So you insert
your goal here and we start by becoming

[31:30]
your goal here and we start by becoming
aware, right? Because awareness is
power. You gain clarity and from there
you can start improving. these hand to
note stats and pop-up packages is step
one and that's where most tools programs
they they end where okay so you get all
this information congratulations you

[31:46]
this information congratulations you
found out that you have at minimum
probably 50 uh 50 leaks that you can
work on now what right uh this that's
why that brings us to step two which is
how do we learn to prioritize what to
work on right and if after you done that

[32:02]
work on right and if after you done that
we have to come up with the diagnose
what is actually the root cause of this
problem and this is actually something
where it often goes wrong like I said
I'm sure many players maybe maybe
actually we can uh we can refer to the
chat here is there any mistake that you

[32:17]
chat here is there any mistake that you
can now think of that you are aware of
but that keeps on coming back
all right so we've gained awareness by
step one I'm sure many people here in
the chat they've done this type of work

[32:31]
the chat they've done this type of work
right and they they might they might
have followed the the process of what
Romero said, right? They went to the
driller, they did they tried to do
everything, but it's still it still
keeps on coming back. There's certain
leaks, you know, you you you remain too

[32:45]
leaks, you know, you you you remain too
curious. You keep making those stupid
hero calls in the river or you keep
punting your stack off or you keep
overfolding despite that you know that
you're doing it. like I've actually had
many coaching sessions which was also
one of the reasons this kind of this
program came alive and then I said so I

[33:00]
program came alive and then I said so I
would review people's game right step
one and then like yeah I know but I
don't know how to fix it
right

[33:15]
MDA demon is a new one so he's referring
now to uh to one of these tools any any
leaks for example I can share maybe a
leak of myself like under bluffing
rivers in position due to uh no actually
let's not go too into jutu but under
bluffing rivers in position or

[33:31]
bluffing rivers in position or
overfolding versus raises or like I said
earlier I think earlier in this
presentation under aggressing pre flop
all like things that if I don't pay
attention to that or if I don't work on
resolving it at the root cause right we
can manage symptoms very good at that I

[33:46]
can manage symptoms very good at that I
was actually very good at that in my pok
career as well um we can manage the
symptoms but we're not we're We're not
fixing the root cause.
Heroing. Yeah, this is a very classic
one, right? Heroing. Out of piling,
being a unable to focus, loss of

[34:01]
being a unable to focus, loss of
determination. This is also a classic
one. Um definitely something that uh
that we will discuss as well. Hero
calling under bluffing river is common.
Yeah. So basically uh yeah I mean I
don't want to go don't want to make this
a whole course on um or a whole

[34:17]
a whole course on um or a whole
presentation on how to fix this but
these are all indeed leaks that you went
to step one right you analyzed you
became aware but now we have to go to
this probably step three right might
make the correct diagnose what's causing
the problem uh and then for example to

[34:32]
the problem uh and then for example to
take the autopilot thing yeah okay then
what do you do well you drink an extra
coffee or you zip an extra rebu or you
tell yourself to focus more but probably
you've tried that uh procrastinates too
much. Funny, it's actually probably in

[34:46]
much. Funny, it's actually probably in
the same category. Uh if we think about
root causes, uh that that's again that's
managing the symptoms. You're not you're
not fixing the root cause. Um
afterwards, we have to train. Then we
have to think about game time. Okay,
what do we do before we play? How do we

[35:00]
what do we do before we play? How do we
perform in game? Uh then we have to
evaluate our process, monitor our game.
Like I said something earlier that many
players weren't doing during the KZ game
world championship that for me I course
corrected very quickly. I saw that some
things were flawed in week one. I
immediately course corrected it and I

[35:15]
immediately course corrected it and I
started to do better right after that.
And repeat uh this is a very important
one. It's like getting getting good at
poker or getting good at anything
mastery right trying to reach mastery it
never ends because basically you always
you always need to improve. Okay there

[35:31]
you always need to improve. Okay there
is no stagnation. You either go
backwards um or you go forwards. It's
your choice. So this is only step one.
Now the league buster program
is what I designed in order to fix this.
So many tools help you find it, but they

[35:46]
So many tools help you find it, but they
don't help you fix it, right? And that's
actually where in my opinion the value
is. And this is what I kept on seeing
over and over. And this is kind of how
this his program came together. So, what
we're doing with the League Buster
program is turning awareness into an

[36:01]
program is turning awareness into an
actual win rate increase, right? Turning
your data into actual action points that
we can do in order to actually improve
as a poker player. So, with the league
buster program, you don't just find
leaks. No, you will fix the leaks.
That's the difference. Now, the leak

[36:16]
That's the difference. Now, the leak
finder, the tool for hand to note,
right? Uh is basically the best way to
start. Uh that's also why there's so
many tools out there, right? It's just
part of it. But in my opinion, even
though I think it's clearly clearly
better than the rest, right? I would not

[36:30]
better than the rest, right? I would not
launch something that I don't think is
superior. Uh it's just a part of it,
right? It's step one. It's analyze. But
what about all these other steps, right?
So what we give you with the league
buster program is a step-by-step system
towards continuous improvement.

[36:45]
towards continuous improvement.
We will help you fix the root causes
instead of managing the symptoms. So for
Mr. procrastination with the autopilot
and not being focused. Not necessarily,
you know, drinking another red boot to
make sure they get focused more, but we
go to the root cause. Why you're why

[37:01]
go to the root cause. Why you're why
you're not engaged, why you're not
focused. Learn how to interpret the data
effectively. This is something that I
see wrong all the time, even from guys
who actually promote these type of
tools. Uh they make pretty big blunders
here and there. So data again, it's not

[37:16]
here and there. So data again, it's not
necessarily what you do, but it's how
you do it. So how do you interpret the
data? How do you work with this data? So
I will teach you that as well. I will
give you tips, tricks and exploits for
every node. Like I said, not every
deviation is a leak. So what I will do
is I will go through every tab of the

[37:31]
is I will go through every tab of the
tool and I will show you guys my game.
So I will go completely naked, right? So
if you ever play against me, you want to
know exactly all my frequencies in every
spot and all my tendencies, well get the
league buster programs, join me at the
tables and you can basically get all

[37:45]
tables and you can basically get all
your money back straight away by
exploiting me. Um maybe actually this is
not a great idea. Please please don't do
that. Um but tips, tricks, and exploits
for every note. So like I said, I will
show you why I prefer certain
strategies. I will show you guys how can
we evaluate if certain strategies are

[38:00]
we evaluate if certain strategies are
working, yes or no. I will tell you why
we should be deviating in certain notes.
So it's not just here is the tool and
here's the GTO benchmarks. No, you
actually get expert guidance, right?
Something that I think is often missing.
Stop autopiloting for Mr.
Procrastinating too much. Stop

[38:15]
Procrastinating too much. Stop
autopiloting. Play sharper and enjoy
poker again. Actually, we are very wired
to enjoy progress. Okay. But why don't
we then shoot for something higher,
right? Because we think it's difficult
or we don't have a clear path. And I'm I
want to give you the clear path.

[38:30]
want to give you the clear path.
Increase your confidence and belief that
your biggest goals and dreams are
possible and more attainable than ever.
I think a lot of players, they kind of
give up because they lack the
confidence, they lack the belief, and
they don't have that clear path. And by
giving you the clear path, giving you
all the the tools that you need, all the

[38:45]
all the the tools that you need, all the
knowledge that you need, you will feel
more confident in your abilities, right?
I can teach you how to how to play
poker, right? But I think the most
important skill a poker player can have
is the ability to continuously improve
and evolve, right? I could teach you a

[39:01]
and evolve, right? I could teach you a
certain strategy, but maybe a couple
years from now, that's not that's not
great anymore. Then then what? Right?
You need to get to another coach. This
is the most important skill a player can
have. All right?
understanding uh how to apply the system
of continuous improvement and do this in

[39:15]
of continuous improvement and do this in
in the correct way because if you
consistently do the right things,
success becomes inevitable. All right, a
little belief breaker here. If you don't
think uh or if you're not looking at,
yeah, wacko, but that's you. You know,
you're this talented guy from the
Netherlands, you know, good-looking,
nicely hair, slick back, right? But

[39:30]
nicely hair, slick back, right? But
that's not me. Uh well, you don't need
all of that and luck or talent, but a
systematic approach to getting better.
And that's the thing that I give you
that has worked for me. uh hundreds of
students that I coached and basically
it's daily habits and routines that
compound over time. That's what makes

[39:46]
compound over time. That's what makes
success. Okay? Not luck, not talent, a
systematic approach to getting better.
All right,
I will now go into the leakinder.
Like I said, this is only part of the

[40:01]
Like I said, this is only part of the
full program. So, if you already have a
lot of experience with leakfinder,
with leak finding yourself, if you use
hand toote a lot, etc., Uh but yeah, you
still find yourself stuck and still do
the things that you know you shouldn't
be doing, right? Uh league buster

[40:16]
be doing, right? Uh league buster
program will definitely be able to fix
you. I will now dive into my hands from
the Cash World Championship using the
tool. And this is kind of what I said,
right? If you look at my Cash World
Championship, I was off to a rough start
in the beginning. What is going on and

[40:30]
in the beginning. What is going on and
how did we turn it around? Monitoring
versus analyzing. Like I said earlier,
analyzing is something that we do over a
big sample, but monitoring is very
valuable. Don't just say like oh this is
a low sample so I should not look at it.
You should definitely look at it because
after this like first 10k hands I wanted
to know what's going on. I wanted to

[40:46]
to know what's going on. I wanted to
have a diagnose. Diagnose gives peace of
mind right. So what I did I went to uh
the leakfinder tool which I'm going to
now open for you guys.

[41:08]
Let me see. Let me also get up to date
with chat before we get into that.

[41:20]
You also need the NDA of population
though a lot of stuff that would look
bad on your stats compared to J would be
good for population. Yeah, that's
exactly uh what we dive into as well and
what I will explain as well. But it's

[41:31]
what I will explain as well. But it's
not necessarily like you can obviously
look at population but then you still
don't know how your game is actually
performing and that actually I will show
you uh to give you like an idea for
example, right? How much aggression do
you actually face? Do you face more
aggression on average than other people?

[41:46]
aggression on average than other people?
How effective are your bets? Right? Is
your exploitive strategy working? Stuff
like that. Right? I'm getting a little
bit ahead of ahead of myself here.
Um, hello. Can you tell us how it's
different from other products on the
market and what makes it better than

[42:00]
market and what makes it better than
something like Moi stat tracker? Uh,
actually just explained that maybe you
just checked in. Uh, like leak finding
and a tool like this is only step one
and that's basically where everyone
ends. This is just the tool that helps
you raise awareness. Now, I think we do
a better job of that, right? Uh, but

[42:18]
a better job of that, right? Uh, but
after that, what do you do with this
awareness? That's I think where most of
the value is. So most of the value is
not necessarily this tool that I
definitely think is great used a lot and
like I said has evolved over the years

[42:31]
like I said has evolved over the years
but more the how to then go about fixing
it. That's where the the the real value
is. So look at my game. All right we won
at 9.4 BB 100. Uh we can see it here
breaking down five six and three to 400.

[42:45]
breaking down five six and three to 400.
This actually been a trend throughout my
career. Usually in battles I do better.
Um but this is obviously a very low
sample. So this is obviously uh purely
purely variance. But for example, if we
would go to a bigger database of last
year, this is mainly 2024.

[43:00]
year, this is mainly 2024.
Uh this year I hadn't haven't really
played much poker. We can see the same
over 55k hand sample. I'm winning at 3.5
BB. The win rate that you see here
behind it is actually from population.
So on average population usually loses
in battles. Uh whereas I always have the

[43:15]
in battles. Uh whereas I always have the
opposite. Battles. I like battles guys.
I play better versus uh versus pros
versus recreationals apparently. But
this is also again this is more of an
focus and engagement issue, right? If we
talk about diagnosing the mistakes, uh
it's not necessarily that I'm a better

[43:30]
it's not necessarily that I'm a better
player playing three to fouranded. No,
I'm on average more engaged. I'm more
focused and therefore I play better. Um
a little spoiler for Mr. Procrastinate
too much. Right? So in order like to
make the diagnos of why that is, there's
many areas where this can be in actually

[43:45]
many areas where this can be in actually
something that we touch on. Let me see
maybe if I can show you this as well. If
I go in the actual course, this is
actually the diagnose and redesign right
after you've analyzed your game. Like I
said, we run through every tab.

[44:02]
said, we run through every tab.
Then we have to prioritize. I explain
everything about that here. Then we go
into diagnosing and resigning. Usually
mistakes can fall into three categories.
Little spoiler, you have knowledge. And
this is what I mentioned, focus and
engagement. The reason why I do better
in battles is not because my opponents

[44:17]
in battles is not because my opponents
are are are are better, right? No,
usually the opponents that are battling
are better players. Uh but I then also
become a better player because I'm more
focused and engaged. So, uh yeah, this
is usually like the mistakes and like I

[44:30]
is usually like the mistakes and like I
said, I'm going to basically go deep
into all of them here. So, like I said,
this is specifically if you for for
these leaks that keep on returning. Like
obviously there's some easy things,
right? Oh, yeah. Pre flop. I'm not
defending enough. Okay, I will start
defending more. But there are certain

[44:45]
defending more. But there are certain
mistakes that just cannot really be
fixed in that way which I'm sure many
many players will have experienced. Um,
so that makes you switch back to the
casum world championship, right? Or
actually let me actually show me one
more thing in in the food database. So
big blind win rate, we will see that as

[45:01]
big blind win rate, we will see that as
well. It's usually one of my one of my
strengths actually big blind defense and
what we can for example see and why why
that is that way. I'm already loser pre
flop for that reason. But why am I loser
pre flop? If we go to single race spot

[45:16]
pre flop? If we go to single race spot
out position pre flop caller. Uh so
that's us. We can see that on average
how often things perform. So what is
outperforming if we can see the betting
on all streets. So we called from the
big blind and we for example dunk bet

[45:30]
big blind and we for example dunk bet
the flop which for people follow me know
I like my dunk bets. Well that's because
I get a how much is this? 7% overfold uh
with a flop dunk, right? I get a 5%
overfold. And this is not like, oh,
let's look at population numbers. No,

[45:45]
let's look at population numbers. No,
this is actual my strategy, how my
strategy is performing. Well, I'm
getting a 5% overfold there on the turn.
And I'm getting another 7% overfold
there on the river, right? Especially
for his block bet, for example. We can
see here it should be 27. I should only
get 27% success, but I getting 41. Uh,

[46:01]
get 27% success, but I getting 41. Uh,
how often do I get um raised? How often
do I face a bet? All stuff that we can
take a look at. For example, on the
river, I'm facing a bet only 30 where it
should be 34. So, I'm overrealizing 4%
equity. So, if we think about that,
well, if I get to the river and I get to

[46:17]
well, if I get to the river and I get to
show them more often because people are
uh not bluffing me, okay, well, I should
probably get to the note more often,
right? So, we can kind of reverse
engineer that way.
Let's go back to the Cash World

[46:30]
Let's go back to the Cash World
Championship sample. So, what I was
mentioning earlier, like things in the
beginning, uh, didn't look that great,
and I was like, what the [ __ ] going
on, right? Assuming, you know, that that
that that I'm a I'm a decent player. Uh,
but even a decent player can over a

[46:45]
but even a decent player can over a
short sample show up and not perform,
right? So, I straight away looked at
like a kind of a first a first overview
of pre flop, and what I straight away
saw is that my squeeze, I believe, was
at like 6%. Uh my three bet was I think
at 10%, my four bet was at 12% or 11%.

[47:02]
at 10%, my four bet was at 12% or 11%.
aka I was being very passive pre flop
like you now see after the 40k hands is
over I up my three bet I up my squeeze
up my four bet because I became uh I put
my focus on it right so I used the to
monitor my tendencies right um also I I

[47:18]
monitor my tendencies right um also I I
could check okay was I opening enough
like these games were no rake and also
with anti so these are like the
benchmark for like a normal six max
cache game I was clearly opening way
looser the small blood was opening less

[47:30]
looser the small blood was opening less
but that's because I was mixing
Um I was limping
oh here we can see actually I was
limping 51% on average I was v pipping
76%.
Um
because I like to in general play a mix
because I think from a mix you can uh

[47:46]
because I think from a mix you can uh
exploit better and here we can also see
in terms of how successful our steals
was how often our our our hands got
three. For example, I was opening button
52 and I was actually not getting three
bet that much 26 compared to what should

[48:00]
bet that much 26 compared to what should
be 27. So actually I was opening more
and I was getting three bet less. So
again, it's like a reflection of how are
my button opens doing in game. And what
I actually quite often see if I if I uh
if I analyze um my students that you can
for example see oh you're going wider

[48:16]
for example see oh you're going wider
but is going wider is that exploit is
that working right? So you want to not
be get three bit enough and you want to
still get high success. tree's going to
be the most important thing.
Um
very wide like I said earlier if you

[48:30]
very wide like I said earlier if you
look at all these number all red
obviously because these are benchmarks
for like higher stakes with rake but
obviously for big B versus uh versus the
2.3x open in the game with for example
anties and no rake yeah I was I was only
folding 33% instead of for example 45%.

[48:47]
folding 33% instead of for example 45%.
But actually the main thing that I was
looking at is like what I said earlier
was the variance tab. This is uh
definitely something that's very
different probably than what you're used
to. And what I saw that where I can see
now that I got all in with ace king

[49:00]
now that I got all in with ace king
versus queens. Like I said if you on a
over shirt sample do very well. Usually
you will see that you actually got
queens plus and ace king off more often
and you got them in more often. Right.
Right. And actually I can see that here
as well with my premiums in the end over
this 40k sample I outperformed almost 2x

[49:18]
this 40k sample I outperformed almost 2x
and I would I would guess that if you
look at most players who ended up on top
over like still a relatively small
sample we all outperformed probably with
our premiums right in order to reach
like team 10b 100 or more. You need a

[49:32]
like team 10b 100 or more. You need a
certain degree of luck in in in that
area. Actually I was dealt ace king and
queens actually less often. As you can
see, you should be dealt at roughly 3%
and I got dealt at 2.5%. But I won way
more with it. As you can see, my win

[49:45]
more with it. As you can see, my win
rate was 778 instead of 515. And also
just one in general more on showdown. So
they remained good more often and I got
them in pre flop and they holded right.
So a contributor also what I was
actually seeing over that first 10k

[50:00]
actually seeing over that first 10k
sample um I was flopping sets pretty
decently but I had a very terrible win
rate. And I actually remember one of the
first hands that I played was actually I
had pocket nines flopped a set on three
nine 10 in a three squeeze spot even and
the guy had tense. I lost a lot of my

[50:15]
the guy had tense. I lost a lot of my
sets quite early on. So I looked at like
okay what's going wrong? Well, if you
see that for example when over a short
short sample, you know, you want some
peace of mind and you see that okay,
well, when I have a set, my RAM rate is
negative 2K, right? And I when I go to

[50:32]
negative 2K, right? And I when I go to
showdown, I don't win it. Like in the
end, for example, you can see that I
overperformed with my sets. We can see
that in win rate both also when I went
to showdown, I won way more often than I
should, right? 10% more often. So that

[50:45]
should, right? 10% more often. So that
means that I've been running good. I've
been flopping sets more often, winning
more because I've also been holding,
right? So, there's plenty of things that
we can go through. Actually, one that I
think is really cool uh that I think is
also a big indicator of variance is like
when you have when you play a three and

[51:00]
when you have when you play a three and
four bet pots and you have an over pair.
So, you have 10 to kings, how often do
you actually hit an over pair and how
long how often does it remain an over
pair? I remember in like periods where I
was not doing so well. I remember I had
a period where this was like 30 35 or

[51:16]
a period where this was like 30 35 or
something. So every time I I a three bit
or four with an over pair an overcard
hit the board right and these are like
obviously you can look at your all in EV
but that only tells like a very small
story. So basically this tab and this is
only the beginning um like this is

[51:31]
only the beginning um like this is
already we're now version 1.6 six uh so
there were already six version before
that and we continuously keep improving
it but this like I said in the end
staying consistent in poker and staying
sane keeping your confidence in check
both not going too far to the right and

[51:45]
both not going too far to the right and
toward the left that's a very big part
of what makes a successful poker player
and this variance tap is here to help
you with that okay so as you can see
here actually even though I had over
pairs more often I actually won less
with that so that's not great uh which

[52:02]
with that so that's not great uh which
probably means that I got a bit unlucky
or I misplayed them right obviously we
cannot necessarily now see that straight
away from the data for that like this is
just the first overview page where we
are we're going to go deeper and deeper
and deeper um but I would say that so

[52:16]
and deeper um but I would say that so
far this seems a pretty bad variance
also if you look at we still had an
overturn quite often and we're running
minus 900 where we should be making 1.8k
8K obviously if you have an over three
or four B pot you should be making good
money but I clearly was not making good
money right so this is again an

[52:31]
money right so this is again an
indicator of variance that you know
something like silly as allin EV doesn't
really show you same with how often you
flop draws for example I wasn't flopping
a lot of flush draws I was making them a
little bit more often the turn but I was
also often missing them on the river so

[52:45]
also often missing them on the river so
I would invest and often miss on the
river and again overshor the samples if
you want to see if okay am I just
playing bad or or am I unlucky
These are stats that you can look at to
give you that diagnose. Another
interesting thing um that I saw, let me

[53:02]
interesting thing um that I saw, let me
see. I think it was at river offense
is that if I go to river offense and I
looked at river allin now this is uh
this is you can see this. So this is
basically my river strategy per bat
sizing. Uh we can now see how balanced I

[53:16]
sizing. Uh we can now see how balanced I
was. So mainly the river bats all in. As
you can see I I betted the river all in
6.3% of the time. should be seven. So I
was missing some Owins. How I was
missing mainly the Oins. Let me see how
balanced were they. So air and low pair.

[53:32]
balanced were they. So air and low pair.
So this is basically how much bluff that
range contained. Right? I was missing 4%
of air but I would had more I was
bluffing more Owens with low pair. So
basically I was bluffing at basically
perfect GO frequency. And here we can
see the success with with this range.

[53:46]
see the success with with this range.
Right. So we bet river O in with air.
How often was that successful? I'm at
50. I ended up 53. So meaning that I got
3% less faults of what I should in
theory. Um whereas over and if we look
at two pair plus so this is obviously

[54:00]
at two pair plus so this is obviously
our value we should have got 60% folds
and we got 62. So we got a little bit
more folds with our two pair in that
first sample I remember like in in the
first 15 can I was look at this. Okay,
so my conclusion was if I jammo all in
on the river, okay, I play a balanced

[54:16]
on the river, okay, I play a balanced
strategy, but my two pair plus I think
was getting like 85% folds, my and my
plus my air and low pair, they were
getting like 28% fold. So I was like,
okay, hm. So basically, if I flop a set,
I lose. Prefable win, I'm not winning.

[54:30]
I lose. Prefable win, I'm not winning.
And when I finally have it in a gem with
the river, they fold. And when I don't
have it, they call. That that seems like
a pretty solid diagnos of why this first
tanky hand is not going great.
Obviously, these were certain things
that are out of my control. Obviously, I
reflected also on okay, did this, you

[54:46]
reflected also on okay, did this, you
know, is it possible that I'm doing
something wrong here with my air low
pair. I looked at those hands. I kind of
I looked at it. I was like, no, this is
probably variance. And then I focused on
things that were in my control, right?
So, the prefab progression had to go up
in general, showing up more engaged,

[55:01]
in general, showing up more engaged,
right? Like I said, the performance
aspect. Um, also a very very big part of
it is actually also I talk about this uh
in the program
uh where did I talk about this? I think
in focus and engagement I'm pretty sure

[55:15]
in focus and engagement I'm pretty sure
that seems seems to be the correct topic
to trap your your biggest opponents. I
think it was somewhere along these lines
where basically I I talked about I gave
this example of
um of the cash game world championship

[55:31]
um of the cash game world championship
because for example a lot of players let
me see if I can quickly find it.
Okay, this is a little bit odd hawk. I

[55:45]
Okay, this is a little bit odd hawk. I
should have probably better prepared
this if I was going to bring this up.
But anyway, um during the cash game
world championship, it's not necessarily
that now these players, right, if you
talk to everyone, everyone said, "Wow,
the level of play was so high like four
mistakes." Well, you think you think

[56:00]
mistakes." Well, you think you think
these guys were now better players? No,
they weren't better players, but they
had a reason to be engaged. They had a
reason to be focused. They had a reason
to bring their agame, right? So, it's
such a big part of performance as well.
And this is what someone in the chat
also said. Um

[56:17]
also said. Um
like uh lacking lacking focus and
engagement. Well during the cash world
championship players suddenly played
their agame way more often. Interesting.
Why is that? What can we learn from
that? And how can we tap into that more
often? So this is actually also

[56:30]
often? So this is actually also
something that we will cover. Like I
said becoming awareness is one. Then
root cause and fixing it is two. Then
being able to perform right at a higher
level it's three. and then being able to
consistently repeat this this before,
right? There's so much more that that

[56:45]
right? There's so much more that that
goes into it. So, these were actually
some things that uh I noticed straight
away in the beginning that uh that I
thought were were interesting to give
you guys a little bit more um more
insight like how we basically builded
it. It goes from the top down. So, we
start with a very general overview. Like

[57:02]
start with a very general overview. Like
if you want to get very specific with
stats, kind of the problem is, oh, I
want to know a certain frequency on tree
bots out of position after betting small
on this specific texture. Well, you kind
of lost the necess the necessary sample

[57:16]
of lost the necess the necessary sample
size there in order to to get a stat
that's actually sort of accurate. So
what we usually do is we start from the
top down to get like general idea of
your game and then we're going to drill
it further to go into for example
specific spots like see where spots in

[57:30]
specific spots like see where spots in
position see where spots out of
position. So to give you an idea for
example of this tab so this is a general
posttop overview tab you can see that
someone was uh was making fun of my one
was a flop. My ego my ego ego got
triggered. Thank you. Uh, I ended up 51

[57:47]
triggered. Thank you. Uh, I ended up 51
over one more than uh than than than
than GTO would be. So during the
challenge, 511 was a flop. How did I get
that? Well, by being a bit more
aggressive, especially out of position,
you can see that it turns red. So I'm
out of the norm. By the way, my sets,

[58:02]
out of the norm. By the way, my sets,
they turn green. Many players might be
used to, if you do stat checking, I
think many player many many of these
programs, they use uh blue uh because
they kind of see blue line as something
passive. Not necessarily true. I think
this is kind of a

[58:16]
this is kind of a
a misconception like that. For example,
I can have a losing red line but still
be a very aggressive player. So I don't
think that correlation is really fair. I
explain you why I use green in the
program as well. But basically it gives
me the green light. That's how I
interpret it. It comes more from the way

[58:31]
interpret it. It comes more from the way
I usually use my hut. If I see players
turn green, that means they give me the
green light to go crazy basically,
right? Um so this for example here gives
me a general overview of how I construct
on average. So on average on flops,

[58:47]
on average. So on average on flops,
turns in position out position. How well
do I balance my my betting ranges and my
checking ranges, right? So for example
here on the river we can see for example
check strong and this is actually one of
the leaks that that I pointed out

[59:00]
the leaks that that I pointed out
earlier, right? Some of these things
that you kind of know that you shouldn't
be doing but you keep on doing them. And
I'll also show you a little bit how I
actually tried to fix this already in
this challenge and kind of show you like
a little before and after. But we can
see for example that in position I have
the tendency to check less strong. So

[59:16]
the tendency to check less strong. So
20% should be correct. Um but I go 16.
What that means is if I have a lower
check back strong that means I I'm value
betting thinner. So I'm going thinner
for value. Now that would be a problem
and kind of I will now show you how kind
of all these stats can work together.

[59:31]
of all these stats can work together.
That would be a problem. So this is a
deviation. So you could say this is a
leak because you're doing something
quote quote wrong. I'm going thinner for
value. So then the biggest problem that
you have when you go thinner for value
is that people can race you off. So
that's a problem. Here we can see check

[59:45]
that's a problem. Here we can see check
weak. So I'm actually value getting
thinner and I'm bluffing less. So
clearly I feel like that spot is getting
underfolded. So that's one. So that's
one assumption that we then we have to
check right. Is this spot that needs
getting underfolded? And are we not
getting raised or is our uh exploit not

[1:00:01]
getting raised or is our uh exploit not
getting reexloited? So for that for
example I can go to river offense
probably
and if I go to lines and we look at bet
river imposition
we see that we're betting 47. This is

[1:00:15]
we see that we're betting 47. This is
the success. So we're getting 1% more
success. So the assumption of okay
getting underfolded just by this first
stat shows no. Obviously we can now go
into lines and specific sizings but this
shows no. And as you can see I am indeed
under bluffing. How often do I actually

[1:00:31]
under bluffing. How often do I actually
get raised? That's pretty interesting.
Let me see. Overview river faced race in
general when we're in position. We face
the race 8% where it should be 9%. So my
adjustments of value betting thinner is
not getting exploited by what it should
be by raises. Okay. So my adjustment

[1:00:48]
be by raises. Okay. So my adjustment
here of going going thinner seems to be
okay. But we're still getting 1%
overfold. So uh where were we? Lines.
Sorry. So we're still getting 1% over.
So you could say I shouldn't bluff. Now

[1:01:00]
So you could say I shouldn't bluff. Now
we can then break that down into lines
where we bet the turn and bet the river
or check the turn and bet the river. And
we can actually see here that in the
cash game world championship. This is a
general trend usually when turns turns
go check check uh usually range
constructions of population on average a

[1:01:15]
constructions of population on average a
little bit weaker and obviously in the
world championship a there was maybe a
little bit of a filter of like better
players came together and they were also
playing better themselves. So they kind
of picked up on that and as you can see
actually that discontinued aggression
line. So betric bad type of stuff was

[1:01:30]
line. So betric bad type of stuff was
actually getting I was not getting the
success I was getting actually 3% less
fault. So and I was under bluffing
there. So there it was actually pretty
correct for me to assume that we should
be under bluffing and I should go
thinner for value. So this is something
that's pretty cool. Uh obviously like

[1:01:45]
that's pretty cool. Uh obviously like
some people tuning in that never done
this like well I don't know how to do
this so if you give me this tool I
cannot use it. That's exactly why we
give you the coaching uh that kind of
comes along with it right.
Um

[1:02:00]
Um
let me see. Ah but so for example this
is uh let me actually go to bet sizes
because we can also break it down. So
what I noticed around in position
bluffing because actually before this
yeah before the cash game world

[1:02:15]
yeah before the cash game world
championship uh I actually recorded this
whole part of the program where we go
into analyzing where I go I think it was
then at river offense right and actually
you can already see this looks a bit
different than what we're seeing here

[1:02:31]
different than what we're seeing here
that means we already updated it again
um and actually I came there to the
conclusion
that my river game was mainly lacking
like a good horistic like half pots. I
identified later that I was not using

[1:02:46]
identified later that I was not using
that often enough and you can actually
now see I'm sort of even overusing it as
you can see 15%.
If I now go to the old database so I'm
now at 15%.
If I go to my old data, the older
database,

[1:03:04]
if I go to river offense bet sizes, you
can see that I was only doing it 9%. So
I was underdoing it. So this is an
example of I took a look at my game. I

[1:03:16]
example of I took a look at my game. I
identified that I was under bluffing the
river quite massively. I was trying to
understand why that was. I realized that
hey, I'm missing half pots in position.
That's interesting. I also realized that
that was actually a sizing that was
pretty high v versus population on
average. We can do that by using the

[1:03:31]
average. We can do that by using the
same tool, right? And going to um maybe
I can quickly show but maybe you can go
to multiple players and then this way
you can analyze the pool, right? And you
can see okay well how often is the pool
actually falling to this half pot and I

[1:03:45]
actually falling to this half pot and I
noticed actually that was definitely a
good line to take. So I build horistics
around it. Okay, in what spots do I want
to add a lot of half pot because I
noticed that I would choke on the river
because I wasn't really sure like okay
which sizing do I use what and I kind of
created now a new protocol for myself.

[1:04:00]
created now a new protocol for myself.
So this is actually funny that you could
see straight away that this was my game
before the kasing world championship,
right? And you saw that after the kasing
world championship because I was
deliberate about something because I did
the leak finding went to the lab, right?
If you go to diagnose redesign, I
figured out what was the re root cause.

[1:04:16]
figured out what was the re root cause.
If we go back to where was it
explaining it here
the feedback loop

[1:04:32]
the feedback loop
&gt;&gt; let's get into the feedback loop seven
so
&gt;&gt; so I I found it then I thought it was
something important to work on right a
river spot uh usually quite important

[1:04:45]
river spot uh usually quite important
Um, and then during game time, so in
terms of pre session, for example, what
I would do, well, it would definitely be
top of my mind. I would be monitoring
it, see if I was indeed uh uh applying
it. And now we're analyzing my game. So,
we kind of came full circle and we can
indeed see that this leak has now been

[1:05:01]
indeed see that this leak has now been
fixed. All right. Okay. I was uh was
talking quite a lot actually. I kind of
missed missed chat here a little bit.
Let me see if there was something before
we move on to like a different point.

[1:05:17]
I am too passive post flop.
The next step Dan B also said thank you
Dan. Um the next step is indeed to
understand where why this is happening.
Okay, we can we can look at where right

[1:05:30]
Okay, we can we can look at where right
we can look at okay uh for example even
like at the overview tab you can
probably already see that right probably
your game if you are general to passive
a lot of your stats will turn green
right and this is just the first
overview then we can go deeper into okay
let's see on the flop and turn with

[1:05:45]
let's see on the flop and turn with
which hand class am I too passive and
this is also where it gets interesting
because usually you can just see like
okay I'm betting or I'm for example if
we go to let's say defense maybe a
little bit easier. Oh, let's say, okay,
I'm I'm overfolding the flop, for

[1:06:02]
I'm I'm overfolding the flop, for
example, 3%. Well, it's
not not not by a very big margin. But
then you can break it down in terms of
hand classes. Okay, well, if you only
have the frequency, I'm overfolding. You
still don't know [ __ ] right? But this

[1:06:15]
still don't know [ __ ] right? But this
is the first the first place where you
go, okay, I seem to be overfolding. Why
is that? Well, let's look at my hand
classes versus with which hand class is
that a problem. Then we can look at it
versus which sizing. Okay, versus which
sizing do I have the biggest problem?
And then we can go to specific position.

[1:06:31]
And then we can go to specific position.
Let's say I'm uh what we're talking
about flops. Let's say I'm single race
spot out position pre flop caller. Okay,
if I look at lines, how often am I check
folding the flop? Right, we were
overfolding I think 3%. Here we're

[1:06:45]
overfolding I think 3%. Here we're
apparently also overfolding 2%. So when
we're in the big blind and we face a C
bet, we're overfolding 2% on average. We
can see here versus one/3 actually
that's not really the case. We mainly
fold versus bigger sizings. Interesting.
Okay. So if people see with a bigger

[1:07:01]
Okay. So if people see with a bigger
sizing I seem to be overfolding.
Okay. And now so again this is this is a
deviation. Is this a good deviation? For
that we can either look at pool or we
can actually look at flop defense versus

[1:07:15]
can actually look at flop defense versus
size. Um, oh, this was actually a typo
that that's uh that's actually on the
list for for the next update, but bear
with me here. Uh, this is actually how
often we call the flop and then face
aggression on the turn. So, it says full
turn, but this actually face aggression
on the turn. So, that means that um when

[1:07:33]
on the turn. So, that means that um when
for example after we see about one/3
here, we face aggression on the turn 44%
instead of 48. So on average that shows
us that we should probably call more
versus a one- turn bet because on
average we're going to face aggression

[1:07:46]
average we're going to face aggression
4% less on the turn whereas compared to
if we bet 60 and 80% for example he's
actually going to barrel 3% more. So
then if we go to the specific line again
is then overfolding versus this three
quarter is that a good idea? Probably

[1:08:01]
quarter is that a good idea? Probably
yes because we're going to face more
aggression on the turn and likely that
means that that rain is stronger. So, is
underfolding versus a one- turn bet a
good idea? Well, probably it is a good
idea because we're facing aggression 4%
less on the turn, right?

[1:08:15]
less on the turn, right?
So, these are uh these are for example
like the kind of the the the
stats that I was showing you in terms of
someone asked me what sets this apart
from other tools out there. It's that
direct feedback and you can find all the

[1:08:30]
direct feedback and you can find all the
answers to your game and how your game
is specifically performing. Uh yeah,
right here. And uh like I said, we can
go as as as deep um as it goes. For
example, another uh another thing that I

[1:08:45]
example, another uh another thing that I
was working on. So I was under bluffing
the river, right? I found actually let
me see. I don't think I didn't actually
check if I fixed that already in this
sample, but probably not. No, doesn't
look like it. So in terms of identifying
where it goes wrong, right, we can

[1:09:00]
where it goes wrong, right, we can
straight away see that if I go to
tribots in imposition prefab caller
despite I'm having a a big a big win
rate, you can see 83 where it should be
actually minus 90 is a spot where you
should have a lose rate because when you
open and call, you're trying to defend

[1:09:15]
open and call, you're trying to defend
less than losing. So if you just raise
and fold, you know, you're probably
going to lose like 250, right? Two and a
half big blinds or three big blinds,
however, however big you open. So it's
actually normal that you will have that
the goal is actually a lower win rate.
But I was actually positive. But despite

[1:09:30]
But I was actually positive. But despite
that we can see see a lot of green here.
So that means that uh and actually I was
aware I was aware that I was not playing
great in this spot. Uh but as you can
see I I just was aware and I went out to
play and I didn't really go about an a

[1:09:46]
play and I didn't really go about an a
way to fix it. So then if you don't do
that well the same the same stuff comes
up, right? I will just actually let me
see if actually I I did stab more.
No, no, still still still no chance. Um,

[1:10:00]
No, no, still still still no chance. Um,
so as you can see here, this is how
often I for example stab the flop. I was
actually I Okay, my falling frequency is
now better than compared what it used to
be. I'm pretty sure
if I go to But I'm still betting 42. Oh,

[1:10:17]
if I go to But I'm still betting 42. Oh,
wait. Actually, where are we're actually
still at the the old sample. Okay, that
makes a lot of sense. So, actually, now
let me see. So, this was an area that I
spotted
was probably important to improve. So,
basically, I was under aggressing

[1:10:30]
basically, I was under aggressing
massively. I was overfolding a lot where
actually, we can also see here, we
actually get way more success. So, if we
step flop, that's actually
outperforming.
And the next phase is, do we actually
face raises? We're actually facing a
flop raised 3% less. So on average

[1:10:45]
flop raised 3% less. So on average
people have not been raising my stab
right. So I'm getting more folds and
less raises which means that I should be
more aggressive myself. Something that
I've identified a line for example that
I spotted here was this one.
Call check bet. So we call flopsy bet

[1:11:01]
Call check bet. So we call flopsy bet
turn goes check check. And there you can
see the river under bluffing rights
which we identified in the general
overview. And we can then go deeper
deeper deeper into why that is. And
that's actually something uh that I take
you along for the ride with right here
in the analyze. I go deeper deeper

[1:11:16]
in the analyze. I go deeper deeper
deeper deeper deeper deeper deeper. And
basically it's almost like it's a it's
like a playalong. It's an analyze along.
So you you you upload this for me and I
just take you by the hand and show you
to every tab. Gives you tips and tricks
along the way. Show you if you if you

[1:11:31]
along the way. Show you if you if you
have this tendency why that is. Right.
Um so then I found this one the call
check bat which we identified something
that I was under bluffing on the river
and I saw for example with sizing wise
that um I was not using this this all in

[1:11:48]
that um I was not using this this all in
often enough. So you call see better
turn goes check check and river they
check to I was like oh interesting again
like I was identifying where do I miss
these river bluffs right and where do I
miss certain sizing. So we identified
the half pot but then I also identified

[1:12:00]
the half pot but then I also identified
for example this spot. So then what I
did is I looked at population. I
actually saw this was top of my mind
like 10% or 12% overfold a little hot
spot for you guys here live on YouTube.
So I was like, "Oh, I'm underdoing it."
So I have a deviation from theory that I

[1:12:16]
So I have a deviation from theory that I
was not aware of. Again, this is the
value of looking at your game tendency
checking. Oh, I make I do something
different here than GTO and I don't have
a good reason for it. Then I went out
there and tried to look for a horistic
and I found that horistic and now I
added like an I like to call these

[1:12:30]
added like an I like to call these
things aggression protocols. to my game.
Little trick where I can overdo it and
up the river bluffing uh uh efficiency
actually. Now, let me see if
I compare this. Can I quickly make a

[1:12:45]
I compare this. Can I quickly make a
Let's quickly make a print screen of
this to compare to the other database.
So that was actually also a good example

[1:13:01]
So that was actually also a good example
that especially over a sample like this
like 40k hands this whim rate here yeah
that's just going to be an indicator of
variance more than it's an actual
indicator that something uh is wrong in
general also right in terms of uh one of

[1:13:17]
general also right in terms of uh one of
the first sections in the program is me
explaining you
how to work with data And this is
something that I think is very very uh
like all these other tools they don't
really give this and a lot of mistakes

[1:13:31]
really give this and a lot of mistakes
um actually get get made because discuss
the benefits of leak finding. Now let's
talk about
&gt;&gt; they don't explain this. So I I I I have
a framework the CBP framework confidence
by by and the pattern matching that you

[1:13:46]
by by and the pattern matching that you
cannot look at one stat in isolation. So
it cannot be like oh I'm looking at my
bottom uh in position preop color three
pots win rate it's good so I'm probably
playing well there no that's not how it
works but if it's very high or if it's
normal it's one stat that points you in

[1:14:01]
normal it's one stat that points you in
a direction that there could be
something there so from there you can
look at other stats to see if you can
confirm or deny this this one stat if
you just wait for one stat in itself to
be accurate enough right in terms of u

[1:14:15]
be accurate enough right in terms of u
confidence interval so how big of a
sample you need to to have that step be
actually correct. If you only use this
philosophy, yeah, you you are not going
to really find something and or you're
going to wait for three years and then
guess what? Uh you should have probably

[1:14:31]
guess what? Uh you should have probably
course corrected earlier. So I will
explain you guys how I use data. Uh this
is so this is how I play three pots in
position F for color. Now that line
specifically probably will not have
occurred. Okay. Well, congratulations. I
did it now 10% instead of 4% but this is

[1:14:46]
did it now 10% instead of 4% but this is
just variance as you can see here 20 20
sample uh but overall still stabbing 42
so pretty poorly uh actually overfolding
now more probably I was also a bit
looser pre flop due to no rake anti etc

[1:15:00]
looser pre flop due to no rake anti etc
but this is a good example of okay I was
I became aware that this is a a trouble
area of mine but I didn't do anything I
didn't go through the process to fix it
right
um
let me Are the suggested spots catered

[1:15:16]
let me Are the suggested spots catered
to anti? Do you have a breakdown with it
without anti ant is the demands enough?
Yes, exactly. Uh then already kind of
kind of answered it there. Um
in terms of uh um

[1:15:30]
in terms of uh um
questions like I'm open to questions
here in the chat. I kind of already
showed you quite a lot uh in terms of my
game. Um,
something actually that was interesting.
We're in the Cash World Championship

[1:15:45]
We're in the Cash World Championship
here now. Yeah. So, as you as you guys
know, I'm a big fan of dunking. As you
can see here, dunk bet 10% where GTO
does it only 4%. Um, I do it for a
reason because I think I showed it
earlier as well. Got 7% overfolds here
straight away on the flop. So, I'm

[1:16:00]
straight away on the flop. So, I'm
making an exploit. I'm dunking way more
often. I can tell you that there's quite
a lot of bananas in here as well. Um, I
definitely I definitely think at some
point started pushing it. Um,
let me see what is uh what I what would
I consider pushing it.

[1:16:18]
Ah, this this Okay, this is when you
know you're getting out of line. Um,
when you're done king three on on Yeah.
Okay. This is when you're pushing it.
Uh, but anyway, so but we can see that

[1:16:31]
Uh, but anyway, so but we can see that
average is not working actually. But I
what I actually noticed that uh during
the Kasing world championship as you can
see a phase race. So half of my dunk was
raced. So in order to to know if you
should do something more often or less

[1:16:45]
should do something more often or less
often there's two important variables
and that's why we have success stats and
equity realization stats because those
are the determining factor. If something
works more often you can do it more
often
and if some if you get raised more often
you can do it less often. roughly I have

[1:17:00]
you can do it less often. roughly I have
kind of the rule for every 1% deviation
you can do something 3% more roughly
three and a half I think it is. So you
could say, okay, well, I'm getting 7%
overfold, so I should do a 21% more on
average. But in the same I'm I'm getting
raised way more often, right? And this

[1:17:15]
raised way more often, right? And this
is actually something that kept on
coming back. If I look at turn
uh don't bet turn 15 where it should be
10. Uh again, was very effective. Hey,
where where did we go? Turn offense.
Sorry.

[1:17:31]
Sorry.
I do it more often. It was indeed more
effective, but again, I got raised 33%.
that that's quite a lot. Whereas
normally, this is something that I
noticed in general in the Cascon World
Championship, you know, people people
were were fighting back a little bit
more often. The same with this one, I

[1:17:45]
more often. The same with this one, I
think I saw I like to check race flops,
but I faced a re-ra flop 10%. This was
something what I noticed people were
playing back quite often, right? So,
normally if you look at the the check
race flop, let me see how often was I
doing it. Uh 22%. In general, I was
overdoing it. But actually, in in the

[1:18:02]
overdoing it. But actually, in in the
cash game world championship, this was
actually not that effective. And I
started to notice this actually and then
I started to tune it down both with the
donking and the check raising. Again,
the importance of also monitoring over a
short sample. Sure, individual stats in
a vacuum are not going to be accurate

[1:18:16]
a vacuum are not going to be accurate
enough to a high frequency. Uh but if
two weeks in you have a couple of
indicators that something might be going
on and you switch before you know if you
have enough confidence that that's
probably the case. A mix of the stats

[1:18:30]
probably the case. A mix of the stats
that you're seeing, the intuition.
Uh yeah, definitely can contribute a lot
uh uh to your win rate. Um I'm trying to
think if there's anything else.
Um,

[1:18:50]
let me see what other what other leaks.
Actually, I can uh
let's let's let's just throw all my
leaks on YouTube. Yeah, that sounds like
a great idea. Uh, let me see where uh

[1:19:03]
a great idea. Uh, let me see where uh
where did I
put it these
these leaks?
conclusion. Uh oh.

[1:19:15]
conclusion. Uh oh.
I can tell you guys the conclusion is
that the wack is bad at poker. I think I
literally
&gt;&gt; I think that's how I uh how I opened
this video.
&gt;&gt; full full overview of your game.
&gt;&gt; Perfectly fine guys. You can you can

[1:19:30]
&gt;&gt; Perfectly fine guys. You can you can
exploit me. So basically I then show you
guys the the the full overview and uh I
rate certain spots and then later we
start prioritizing it. Uh, where where
did I wrote down that the conclusion was
that I'm bad at poker?

[1:19:51]
Conclusion, the wacker sucks at poker,
right? Next step, request a refund. Uh,
but that's the truth, guys. I mean,
everyone has leaks in poker, right?
Everyone has leaks and tendencies.

[1:20:00]
Everyone has leaks and tendencies.
Luckily, we don't have to be leak free
at poker. Just leak less than your
opponents. Poker is a game of mistakes.
Make less mistakes than your opponent
and you will win. Uh, that's kind of the
conclusion. So, don't let leak finding
discourage you. Um,

[1:20:19]
someone asked uh where you can buy this.
Actually, a good question. Uh, pretty
bad marketeteer, I guess.
Uh, you can go over actually. I think

[1:20:31]
Uh, you can go over actually. I think
there's a link in the description down
below, but I'll also put it here on uh
on YouTube
in the in the chat for you. Um, but like
I said, this is the this is the tool.
It's only one part of the program. I'm
very passionate and uh like people

[1:20:46]
very passionate and uh like people
people were like there were some people
especially in the circles that were
waiting for this for quite long
especially at this part. I kind of got
stuck for I think a month or two before
I was happy with how it turned out. It
turned out that um that there's a reason
why people don't deliver this part of of

[1:21:00]
why people don't deliver this part of of
of the process because it was [ __ ]
hard. Uh but I think we've done a great
job in uh in helping you diagnose and
redesign. Uh so if you have uh leaks
tendencies that have been holding you
back for years, right? Things that you

[1:21:15]
back for years, right? Things that you
know
okay remember no is when awareness
pressure most people are aware of
tendencies but they don't know it. Just
like I'm aware of that imposition three
pots improve a car. I'm a nit of I'm
like very passive as you could see here.

[1:21:31]
like very passive as you could see here.
I overfold the rivers pretty massively.
Rivercon win very high for the people
that don't really know stats. If you
have a very high river wind, that's not
necessarily great. You could say, "Oh, I
win a lot when I river." Yeah, if you
only call the nuts, yeah, you win a lot.
Um, so that means actually I have a lot

[1:21:45]
Um, so that means actually I have a lot
more room to work with. I think on
actually by by the way, actually on
average, I don't think that's
necessarily problem that I usually have
like overfolding phase river bat. Uh,
here we can actually also see that the
this is actually another leak that I can
point out. This was this is still the

[1:22:01]
point out. This was this is still the
Qashqam World Championship.
Let me quickly confirm that. Yes, this
is the Cash World Championship, not the
other database. But you can see that on
average on the river, I face 5% less
bets. So when I'm out of position, Vinn
is in position, they give up river more

[1:22:15]
is in position, they give up river more
often. We can see actually when I do uh
hero call the river, I actually also win
less, which kind of confirms that
belief. Um here we can see that as well
if I went call call
um I was winning the river 32 instead of

[1:22:32]
um I was winning the river 32 instead of
45. So that means that being sticky I
think someone was a fairly stick fellow
sticky guy in the chat. I feel you man.
I feel you. It's hard. Uh so this is
actually another this actually a point
that I'm currently working on. Uh

[1:22:45]
that I'm currently working on. Uh
because as you can see here when I'm in
position um like hero hero calling is
going great. If you look at in position
call air low pair in position river call
win 51. So I'm actually still
overfolding as we can see fold river in
position 51. That's actually pretty

[1:23:00]
position 51. That's actually pretty
massive overfold 9%. And I'm actually
underfolding when I'm out of position
where I should be actually doing the
opposite. I should be doing the
opposite. I should hero fold more when
I'm out of position and hero call more
when I'm in position. And in general for
people that also new new to like leak
finding it's normal that you should say

[1:23:17]
finding it's normal that you should say
okay uh shouldn't you fall to the river
an equal amount of times you're in
position out position
and
actually now I have to think about this
maybe that's
actually I don't even know actually if

[1:23:30]
actually I don't even know actually if
that's true but the reason why this is
42 and this 57 is because out of
position player uses a lot of small
sizings and therefore on the river on
average we should be folding less but if
you obviously look at just break
actually we can actually see that here.
Yeah, it's true. Actually, when we're

[1:23:45]
Yeah, it's true. Actually, when we're
out of position and we face a one- turn
bet, we should actually fold more. Okay.
Um, but the reason why on average the in
position player has to defend more,
where were we?
Where were we in position? Is because we
face a one- turn bet, for example, way

[1:24:00]
face a one- turn bet, for example, way
more often than when we're out of
position. Out of position, we usually
face polarized sizes. Therefore, we can
actually fold more and therefore it's
also easier to overfold in position. As
you can see, I'm also an overfolder. uh
54. It's not the highest fold number, I

[1:24:15]
54. It's not the highest fold number, I
might add. Uh but yeah, definitely still
uh still too high. So definitely
something to work on like my bluff
catching game out position in position
although not terrible. Uh definitely
needs work.

[1:24:32]
Image posting about to become a massive
river station through a poss maybe.
Maybe uh with this program, do you leak
find easily opponents in order to
exploit them? Yeah, I mean you can uh
you can basically find everything you
know like like I said earlier I think in

[1:24:46]
know like like I said earlier I think in
the in the presentation as well. I have
made the leakfinder
uh or tweaked it in a way that's
specifically
designed to get the maximum out of your
own game game analysis. But obviously

[1:25:00]
own game game analysis. But obviously
you can use this on your opponents as
well. Are we still in the Yeah. So for
example, we can go to multiple players.
Um let's just say at least thousand
hands. I don't think actually there are
much fish in the game. So I don't really
think I have to set a filter. Um if we

[1:25:18]
think I have to set a filter. Um if we
now click apply
then basically we can see that this was
on average what players were doing.

[1:25:30]
on average what players were doing.
Um is that correct?
So this for example you have to already
be careful like for example ace king
queen plus o in this stat is obviously
is very has a lot of showdown bias when
you when you start analyzing population

[1:25:46]
you when you start analyzing population
this way. So that's something to to
watch out for. But for example to
confirm my uh read river offense in
position lines
in position bluff 31%. So indeed people

[1:26:02]
in position bluff 31%. So indeed people
were 1% under bluffing when they're in
position on average
but actually people were bluffing pretty
damn pretty damn well on average but
yeah 1% under bluff on the river and I

[1:26:17]
yeah 1% under bluff on the river and I
was over calling the river when I was
out of position so that's not great. Uh
they were actually also still under
bluffing the river when they're out of
position. So there it actually overfold
kind of made sense. Uh interesting also
pre flop I thought that on average
people were playing way too nitty. We

[1:26:31]
people were playing way too nitty. We
can saw earlier that I was defending
here for example bottom versus big blind
30% they're defending 43 they're folding
43%.
So that I think was a was definitely a
league of the population on average. You
saw that I was squeezing 12 they were
squeezing 10 is I think it's actually

[1:26:46]
squeezing 10 is I think it's actually
fine.
Um but yeah so you can also use it. I
mean you can you can literally say all
frequencies of of your pool. Um, and you
can also see in terms of if your pool

[1:27:00]
can also see in terms of if your pool
makes it bat, how often that's
successful on average, how how does the
poo so all these kind of success that
still work. You obviously have to watch
out for, for example,
these hand class stats. They're they're
they're screwed because there's a

[1:27:15]
they're screwed because there's a
showdown bias. When you analyze your
game, you have all whole cards reviewed.
And when you analyze your opponent's
game, you don't have all cards reviewed.
That being said,
here in this sample, it's already a
little bit less because all winning
hands had to go to showdown. Um, if you

[1:27:31]
hands had to go to showdown. Um, if you
play I think it's ignition, right? You
also have all whole cards. So, you can
actually use that as well. Uh, but yeah,
that's something just to take in
consideration. So, yeah, you can work
you can use it basically for yourself.
Uh, but definitely also for uh for other

[1:27:45]
Uh, but definitely also for uh for other
players. But like I said, there's many
tools that that can do this for you. Uh,
do I think we build the best tool? Yes.
Uh but this is only step one, right?
Step one of the analyze. As you can see
here, feedback loop. It's step one,

[1:28:00]
here, feedback loop. It's step one,
right? What do you do after you've
analyzed? What have what do you do after
after like I said after you you you went
along with me for the ride and you ended
up with a document uh that's the size of

[1:28:15]
up with a document uh that's the size of
how big is it? We're gonna see it.
That ended up being quite quite big,
right? where we gathered all our info,
our leaks. So, how do we then go about
uh prioritizing it? Right? That's then
kind of next step aka prioritizing the

[1:28:30]
kind of next step aka prioritizing the
leaks uh level of difficulty.
So, then kind of we then go uh yeah, go
from there in in how to fix it. And
that's what I'm most passionate about in
terms of what I've made in the last
couple of months.

[1:28:46]
couple of months.
Any
questions before we're going to wrap
this off? I think I've showed everything
um that I wanted to show.
I will tag along here for another uh
fiveish minutes, 10ish minutes. You can

[1:29:00]
fiveish minutes, 10ish minutes. You can
ask me anything as long as long as it uh
as long as you stay on topic.

[1:30:47]
I think uh am I gone?
How many hands do you recommend

[1:31:00]
How many hands do you recommend
uploading to the leak finder to start?
Actually I uh explain you that here.
goal of leak finding working with data.
Uh
leak sample size

[1:31:17]
it kind of depends. Let me see. Do I
explain it or yeah sample size. The
bigger your sample, the higher the
accuracy for each individual stat. Um
how much has your game changed? That's
something that you have to ask yourself.
uh whim rates. Like I said, if on a

[1:31:32]
uh whim rates. Like I said, if on a
smaller sample, it becomes more a
monitoring tool and like an indicator of
variance. On a larger sample, this
actually can show you uh into areas
where you possibly have any leaks.
Uh we can still uh we can still leak

[1:31:46]
Uh we can still uh we can still leak
find and this is actually very important
point. Let make sure it's all in screen.
we can still leak find with smaller
samples as we don't draw the framework
that I was explaining earlier in terms
of how to interpretate
uh data which again like that's uh yeah

[1:32:02]
uh data which again like that's uh yeah
you have to be a little bit careful with
data and with fireworks so kids be
careful with fireworks

[1:32:16]
why does the stream fail when we don't
have internet prompts.
Well, that's not great. Why do I have a
green screen?

[1:32:34]
Not talking to myself. I'm trying to see
in my streaming
software there.
Are the isshes also there on Twitch? I'm

[1:32:45]
Are the isshes also there on Twitch? I'm
also streaming on Twitch by the way. Let
me see.
No, on on Twitch I don't seem to have
the problem. Well, that's weird.
Uh

[1:33:03]
the hands, the favorite hands, they will
uh
let me let me restart the stream.
