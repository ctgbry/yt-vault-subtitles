Previously on the podcast, we have
interviewed five of the top competitors
from the Cash Cam World Championship
across three episodes. Now, the players
are giving us an exclusive breakdown of
some of the craziest hands that they
have played during the challenge. In
this video, we will cover five crucial
hands of the midstakes world champ
Nikita aka one was of flop 45. across
these hands. He shows his ability to
find unintuitively thin value bets,
explains the thought process behind his
unique flop three betting strategy
versus raises, which left many players,
including me, very confused, and
delivers a theoretical masterass of dunk
betting in four bets, my personal
favorite. Let's go. All right, first
hand, we are in the big blind
and we decide to squeeze.
So far
&gt;&gt; yeah I decided to squeeze because uh
this uh Paris D guy was very loose pre
flop. I think he opened like more than
50% from cut off or something like this.
&gt;&gt; This is in the anti game. So he was
definitely uh definitely taking
advantage of the ante.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
And he I think he played only on anti.
&gt;&gt; All right. So he uh he does decide to
make the call and the button comes along
as well. So three-way. Very interesting
flop. Almost have a straight flush, but
not that great.
&gt;&gt; I guess both of their ranges are quite
pocket pair heavy and seeded stuff as
well. Of course. Um, so I decided to
cate this board and go from there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like it. I think we have more
like like you said like a jack off with
a spade, ace queen off with a spade, ace
king off with a spade, obviously pocket
aces. We obviously have all the all the
sets that they're unlikely to have. So,
probably a good board for us. Nazera
gets out of the way. Button calls. Okay.
What do you make? What do you make of
his range?
&gt;&gt; Um, pocket pairs, fewed connectors,
fewed A6, ace,
S6, and uh, yeah, some queen jack, jack
10, king, jack. But I think most of
these combos would three bet um, the guy
on cut off. So I think it's more kind of
pocket pairs heavier.
&gt;&gt; What do you actually think you should do
here with let's say you're in the button
shoes, you face this quarter C bet and
you have Jack 10 or let's say you have a
low pocket with a spade. You think it's
like standard calls or
&gt;&gt; Yeah, on this port it's like with Jack
10, he doesn't have many of the implied
dots and I probably wouldn't.
But now I actually would like um see bet
some
missed like combos like ace five sealed
I think. So yeah he definitely can float
on street.
&gt;&gt; Yeah kind of see what he does have the
position right with the intention maybe
to bluff. I don't think yeah just
drawing to hit your outs is
&gt;&gt; a great idea. Okay turn we have a flush.
So
&gt;&gt; yeah. So I decided on this card that uh
he has all of his pairs with spade and
uh he would probably
uh bet them on the turn and check to
check the river.
So
in my head I I just plan to check race
this combo because I think I so far
ahead and um at this point I had quite
an image that uh I'm capable to run
something crazy here. So I thought that
I will be called very lightly in this
spot by this guy particular.
Yeah, this is something that we talked
about right in the podcast that part of
your strategy was kind of, you know, the
kind of the advertisement strategy,
advertise like some crazy stuff and cash
in later. Um, he does indeed go ahead
and make the stab. You indeed go for the
for the check race for value.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And he also could level himself up
because uh like in his uh mind, I
probably would either bet a strong head
hand or I would check all it. So also
it's a good idea to do check race here
with sets. It's quite interest play on
this run out
&gt;&gt; kind of like a like like a mergy type of
play then I guess or no actually it's
just a bluff.
&gt;&gt; Yeah it's a bluff with a chance to
improve. So likes to ch sets on for
flush
and he turns them into bluff on the
river or hit them cooler other guy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess I guess specifically
queens. I guess there's some sprinkle
maybe of ace queen off in the buttons
range like one hand that I can maybe
think of. So that would actually be
quite nice. He does decide to make the
call. Um river is the 10. I just stick
to my player
&gt;&gt; and gem for value.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and jam for value. Uh maybe he
like he can expect me to bluff like uh
can as I said set so but also king
queen, king jack with the same type of
hand and uh
it's quite easy to overluff actually
here with those type of hands.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes, I agree. Once you once you
kind of recognize a spot and be like,
"Hey, if you have two pair, it's a good
bluff. And then if you bluff all your
two pairs in sets, yeah, then it's
indeed a pretty okay spot to bluff. If
you did go fancy with, let's say, just
ace king, you do not have a straight,
but I don't think that really matters.
Would not people blend bluff a pretty
funky?"
&gt;&gt; No, it's kind of too random, I think.
&gt;&gt; I guess the 10 of spades doesn't really
have anything with the 10 of spades. I
guess only like 108 maybe or 10 nine. So
he act no 10 high is not even possible.
So it's either a royal flush with the
10. Now I guess I guess we're not really
afraid of a 10 high 10 eye flush, right?
Maybe only 108 108 of spades. Pocket t
probably gets it in pre flop or three
bets pre flop. So maybe only the ax were
actually worried about only the ace
flush.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I I just think
I have enough equity to show this amount
in this spot especially given like the
he definitely has all the pocket pairs
in this line. So, not definitely, but I
was assuming it.
&gt;&gt; So, we do go ahead and make the jam.
Fill makes the call and he shows up with
the pocket force with a spade, which
like I said, I find an interesting hand
on the flop already in terms of Okay, so
now he kind of This is kind of one of
the best turns, right? The improved I I
guess this hand if theory calls I I I'm
not really sure.
I would imagine like right that you're
going to fold like eights with a spade
maybe and then call your fours something
along those lines but purely as like a
bluff I think stepping up
&gt;&gt; it feels a bit
light
but like you said he probably saw you do
something crazy right so this is a great
example I think of advertisement paying
off in the future
&gt;&gt; yeah yeah yeah
to be fair it's easy to over overbluff
this line if you if you have it in your
arsenal.
&gt;&gt; Well played. I think it's a good example
of like I said how you how you managed
to get more value during the challenge.
Another squeeze spot. Actually, we
squeeze this time pocket 10 filling
calls again in the anti game.
&gt;&gt; It's too good regulars.
&gt;&gt; You did you you did well in the anti
games.
&gt;&gt; I won all my money in the anti games.
&gt;&gt; Okay, nice. um anti specialist almost a
break even in normal less.
&gt;&gt; So this time it's just the two of us.
You said two two good regulars. Okay.
Started with a seabed.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I guess it's pretty standard to
go
with a seed on this board.
&gt;&gt; Filling calls.
&gt;&gt; Now I guess is where the first real
decision comes in.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I
I think again in this hand uh
the MP has all the pocket pairs like um
it's quite tempting to call them versus
a squeeze with anties. Um how large is
the squeeze it was? I think 14 blinds.
&gt;&gt; What is it?
&gt;&gt; 14 bits.
&gt;&gt; Um it's whatever. I think he can fold.
He can call. But um most of the pairs he
calls is like uh sixes, eights through
10.
It's less juices, less fives, I guess,
but it's whatever. Uh the turn I decided
to go with I use this size quite a lot.
It's a merger size and uh it leaves in
position range very wide. He basically
can continue
almost everything he continued on the
flop except like uh but missed uh
diamonds.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So yeah, you basically basically
like you said so you kind of range him
very pocket pair heavy and you just see
a lot of value. So you decided to to use
your tents as like another another value
bet versus like you said the sixes,
eight, nines. I guess it's also easy to
for you to have bluffs, right? You can
just have king queen off suit for
example just to name just to name a
hand.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. He also doesn't have se jacks and
uh he might uh fold pre flops on jack uh
block jack 10 but queen jack.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So basically only ace jack king
jack that were sort of worried about
pocket seven.
&gt;&gt; Well he he also should call a pre flop
king queen kings aces. But um what I
noticed that people didn't do this that
much in those games. I think they just
got used to the two for bets and
strategy with those hands or maybe they
too scared to call queens prayer for
kings. It was quite during the whole
challenge it was a dynamic of uh people
were tribetting a lot and they received
more for bets. So I kind of deduct
the top of the range.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So river is a is a queen.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And we have a half a stack behind.
So and it's a nice card for me to bluff.
So I decided that uh with tense it's
like I don't really want to check call
it because he will check back all his
slow down value. But I beat quite a
large portion of the trench and also I
think uh this guy could overall me in
particular. He s I I think he saw some
showdowns.
&gt;&gt; All right. So um
&gt;&gt; for me it's easy to order bluff on this
spot as well.
&gt;&gt; I mean the queen for example I said
another turn like ah you can just take
like a king queen or something.
Obviously the queen does improve you. I
guess then now the main bluff is like
ace king or maybe some ace4 suited or
maybe it turned like a five for suited
or something in the bluff something
along those lines
&gt;&gt; with this spear you can over bluff his
king. Yeah, if you blast all of them
&gt;&gt; especially for off pot. Uh so yeah,
another actually another sort of
&gt;&gt; maybe the nines was actually not
necessarily thin, but this is definitely
a thinner thinner value bet where you
expect to get paid off light. Uh Villain
did indeed go ahead and make the call.
He had ace king. What what do you make
of what what do you make of his call? If
we think basically, right, it's easy
with the the ace king. I I guess it
blocks some ace queen spades, blocks
king, queen spades, but on that I guess
aces and kings, but it also blocks ace
king, right? which is your main main
bluff.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but his suit you are nice. I think
it's a nice bluff creature. Um
&gt;&gt; you give up because you got give you
give up the spades yourself. So you
don't actually really block the bluffs.
&gt;&gt; Um yeah, I might give them up and uh he
blocks value and kind of unblocks bluffs
with like 8 n 9 10 type of stuff. So
it's okay. But he tunked I remember for
quite a bit. I think it was last second
call. Yeah, I think I think definitely
the suits here, like you said, they
definitely matter. Like you're probably
not bluffing spades, right? So if you
have ace king, the one that you're
following through on the river are the
the ones with hearts, clubs, diamonds,
not ones with spades. So yeah, like you
said, he's not
&gt;&gt; I think he his his combo is the best
bluff catcher in the spot. It's much
better than a pair, I think.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Then like pocket eight, pocket
nines, right? Especially if you said
that your bluffs can come from 89
suited, maybe like some 108 suited, 10 n
suited, stuff like that. Next hand we
have 10 eight suited on the button
big blind defense flop a gutter
start with a seabbat what kind of what
was kind of your strategy I don't think
there was anties involved no involved
&gt;&gt; it's no no anti um I usually like to see
this part for 40% with with whatever
frequencies
&gt;&gt; with whatever frequency you feel like in
the moment
&gt;&gt; when when the anties kicked Did that
change for you anything? Would you would
you for example see a bit more see it
less?
&gt;&gt; Much more. Uh I think I was u first week
I was see betting close to 100 versus
many guys in many sports because you
just printing that way
&gt;&gt; face a check race and normally I guess
we would call but you actually come over
the top which is something actually we
discussed the hand earlier with uh with
kickim where uh there was actually a
clicking war going on between you guys
and I I actually played quite a lot of
hands with you as well where I saw this
I saw this play. So when I saw this
hand, I had to I had to ask. Let's Let's
get in the mind of Nikita here.
&gt;&gt; You were definitely the player, I think,
that click clicked back the most in the
pool.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I like to do this because um
you enter uh with this kind of play, you
enter the zone where you both have to
figure out. You basically can hand read
each other better. But with uh position
I think I have a better ability to do
it. And also I think um versus
three bets many people over fast play
their strong value. That's what I'm
noticing. So when they call I kind of
can arrange them a little bit better. I
think it's also it's general matter. I
think in the championship that people
tend to fast play their value more than
they should in my opinion.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And the way you take advantage of
that later on is I guess with being
aggressive and catching maybe more
because they're more ready to bluffs.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, catching being aggressive myself.
Also, this combo is uh very nice to
triet with because it's uh unblocks uh
his uh check bluffs with back door uh
type of stuff like king eight, queen
eight, like king five with back doors.
This kind of hands. So I thought it's a
really nice combo to have and
&gt;&gt; probably back doors
&gt;&gt; from all the this this is this is the
best one because let's say for example
you have 108 of hearts and he now comes
over the top that would be a bit shitty
right you assuming that you're going to
fold you know you fold out more you fold
more equity so yeah I like it all the
108 combos is definitely definitely the
best one so yeah very very nice find
&gt;&gt; I think other combos I would float and
uh this one I will just click it
&gt;&gt; all right so he does make call. So I
guess I guess now we get into kind of
that ranging advantage you talked about,
right? That you kind of now are able to
range him better. He checks. So what do
you make of what do you make of the
situation now that we entered your
streets?
&gt;&gt; Uh he can continue with all his open
elders. Maybe he can feel some guard
shots and uh from the value hands. Uh
but I also I was opening button 2.3. So
he
he has a jack seven, Jack six, Jack six.
No, but Jack seven of you he can have,
but I think uh at this point he would uh
as I said more more leaning to fast play
this hand. Uh he has a 067
off and um and yeah uh with ace he might
hit something like a7 also he check
raised um
not uh too big I think it was 50% or
something this
&gt;&gt; yeah like
and this tells me that he does it with a
bunch of jacks as well maybe like he can
do it with jack n jack eight post major
protection king jack also there I think
and um with uh this range in mind uh I
decided to
throw another bet uh sizing wise
uh I think it's too small in retrospect
because uh it doesn't apply pressure to
his uh draws openenders but uh on the
other hand it's whatever you and bluff
them off later.
&gt;&gt; Like especially when he calls now twice,
you range him as quite weak and like you
said that actually doesn't matter
because I'm just going to bluff him off
later anyway though. It's kind of your
your thoughts. River 10 interesting
river I guess he makes let me see 89
will call turn I guess so right
&gt;&gt; for this size. So he he should probably
have like some some leads here maybe.
Right. 8 N I guess is way way more
likely in his range than than your
range. He does go ahead and check which
I kind of expect. Now we have a 10. It's
good. Not good
&gt;&gt; on the river. I I think I think quite a
bit about the decision because
98 hit but on the other hand I thought
he has a bunch of
um
and uh also I thought that uh with u he
doesn't have a
flashes there because it's quite
tempting to check
7 x and 6x with a flash like a combo
drawer. It's
&gt;&gt; your smaller sizing, right? Maybe with
weakness and like, "Hey, [ __ ] it. I have
65 of hearts. Let's just 64 of hearts.
Let's just go for it." 68.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, with this thought that
he probably doesn't have flushes and I
don't have I couldn't come up with a
what can I have with a bluff here. So, I
just I just thought basically he's weak
here and uh I I'm whatever.
&gt;&gt; Bard is a bit scary. I can have a bunch
of weird stuff. Uh let's just go for it.
&gt;&gt; You do block the eight knight. That's
worth
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Well, he did indeed make the fold. You
remember him? If if it took if it took a
little while or uh then he probably had
a decision, right?
&gt;&gt; No, pro. No, I think he it didn't took
him a while. Don't remember actually.
&gt;&gt; Maybe like a king jack or something.
Show the 108. You you probably made a
little note. Ruffy Ruffy saw me go crazy
with the 108.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a nice to uh run such bluffs
and just note them.
&gt;&gt; It either it either works
&gt;&gt; for the later reference.
&gt;&gt; It works or you have like an investment
&gt;&gt; or you have some advertisement for the
future. I love it. Are you grinding

Okay, pocket sixes on the bottom. Anti
anti-hand again your specialty big blind
defense one/3 C bet
which I guess is is you you would how
would you approach this board on average
&gt;&gt; I was opening a lot and I think I just
uh see better 25 everything just uh
experimented with it but uh this board
it's I think it's whatever usually you
go with a bigger size but I think it's
whatever it uh puts a lot of pressure on
his overs anyway
get checked which I guess is going to
happen quite often.
&gt;&gt; Um and actually again we get into a into
a clicking war. So tell me,
&gt;&gt; yeah, my combo is uh whatever I think it
uh benefits uh
from tribet quite a lot just folding out
his uh like it blocks quite a lot of
bluffs but uh uh with antis he has like
um eight six with eight of clubs like
king six with king clubs
same as a six with ace clubs so I'm kind
of playing pressure with so and also
it's merging
&gt;&gt; he will continue some person I mean like
this hand can do whatever
&gt;&gt; but I think it benefits from equity
denial
&gt;&gt; yeah I guess you know he can call you
with H4 A5 if he folds jack 10 with a
club or something is perfectly fine and
like you said I mean if he has king six
with the king we can actually get some
value as well I guess the only quote
quote downside is that he can come over
the top but I guess we Now just call or
do you see this as a downside or are we
going to click it back? What are we
going to do?
&gt;&gt; Um our combo doesn't suffer from his
re. I think you can do whatever. Uh
shove is a nice option here. Usually
people reerase this with some type of
pair plus something as a bluff like ace
ace juice with ace of cups would be
nice. Ace4
some maybe ace5 m kind of thing would be
nice. So you can shove against those and
uh you don't mind like if for example
from a in his shoes it would be nice to
do this with a combo like
I guess which denies quite a lot from
me. So I think it's whatever I can call
I can push.
&gt;&gt; You do actually like to call. I mean, if
you if you push here, then it's like
Mery versus Mergy click click click
click click. Some some crazy stuff going
on. Actually, I don't mind the gem,
especially the right if he has a set,
&gt;&gt; which I guess scenario while we have,
you know, we have a gutter, we have a
flush. It's not the end of the world.
&gt;&gt; Turn is seven. So, we pick up straight
flush draw.
&gt;&gt; Fillain goes ahead and continue the
aggression.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, here it just uh plays itself.
just call. River is the 10 of clubs
and
Fiden now checks and it's up to us.
&gt;&gt; Yes. So I tanked with this combo quite a
while. Um and uh I came to the
conclusion that uh he didn't u like in
retrospect he has a reason to
uh check his uh not flashes and king
high flashes to expect him to blast off
something like 56
maybe
without a club or three pocket threes
for threes something like this to turn
something into a bluff. But uh yeah,
maybe it was a timing as well. Now I
don't remember how fast did he check and
also I had a quite a dynamic with the
guy. I I thought on river that uh he
might uh try to bluff catch me in this
uh spot because u he might
think that I
fast might fast fast play not flush ros
on the flop for whatever reason. Yeah,
he might think that I'm kind of this uh
pair plus openender heavy and I will
blast uh them off on this run out. So I
thought maybe he will call me with all
his straits which a lot of combos all
his sets can take this line. I didn't
expect uh two pairs in this line but it
can be as well. So, it's just a matter
of I don't think I'm ever beat and I've
I've shown enough weird [ __ ] that I
could expect.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it took me quite a while to make
this show.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because like it's very hard if if
I put myself in his position, right?
Having played against you quite a lot as
well. Like I've seen some, you know,
there's sort of the the flop 45 random
factor. Like I've seen some hands. I'm
like, "Yeah, okay. Well, you know, if if
he feels like doing it on the flop, it
there can be anything right now, right?"
So I guess if you have that kind of
image on you, uh it definitely think can
help you to get looked up because
normally I mean I guess normally a range
that would see bet flop then three bet
me then call I would say probably has
something with clubs in it. So then when
the clubs run out you know
&gt;&gt; um but you indeed did got called by the
54. Uh so the advertisement paid up once
again. Um, what what do you make of his
call? Like you said, yeah, he just, you
know, given given what you've showed him
previously, you understand it. Something
along those lines.
&gt;&gt; Um, yeah, I expected to to see hands
like this as I said, but uh he blocks
quite a lot of bluffs he's holding, I
would say.
&gt;&gt; So, better like H3 or something or 36 or
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Straight is
definitely better here. Well, another
another good example of you uh
capitalizing on that blue line after
having in invested a little bit in your
image. I think this is the last hand
which is my personal my personal
favorite hand. Five four spades. We we
three bet. Let me see. This is nonante.
Yes, nonante. So, we three bet and we
face a for bet. I guess after the three
bet four bets always calling.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Nothing really else to say.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. A78.
I was going to say we check, but you
throw out a little donkey donkey. I can
always appreciate that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think sizing wise it's me
because u
you would like to go bigger 20 quarter
of the pot. Yeah. I don't I don't know
why
I just threw it. I like I think in
retrospective he could read into this
and uh because like a a little feeler
bet. See see where you're at.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Um you can dunk better uh on
this check text checkers in for bad
spots because you have all sevens and
eights and he usually doesn't and all
the 87 and uh
&gt;&gt; you have a queen off I think is also a
pretty big big factor here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I say not for betting.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So it's kind of a play you can you
you allowed to do here quite a lot.
&gt;&gt; I like it. Um do you think uh people
would overse this board because
obviously you know we dunk bet because
we don't expect uh or at least with with
value right we we then dunk bet uh
because we don't expect to see bet often
enough. Obviously when you have a bluff
you can always still lead. I don't think
he will go to crazy seating in his
medium pairs here.
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; And it's because
&gt;&gt; because small blind hits it too well.
&gt;&gt; Turn nine.
&gt;&gt; Uh
&gt;&gt; yeah, I think from from here the hand
plays itself.
It's kind of a very good card for me.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it improved your 65, your jack 10
if you had it. I guess pocket knife.
It's a It's hard to find a bluff for me.
Bluffs for me like sixes maybe. 10 N.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess seven six something like
that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, six sixes 10 N. Yeah, you can find
but uh Zak that's so good. You I think
you can see you can continue like the
whole
&gt;&gt; and five for also it blocks like the A
blocks maybe an A4 suited that he for
bad. So he calls again.
&gt;&gt; River three. Well, your your bluffs are
getting less and less, right? If you had
a flush drawer, I guess it now also gets
there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of plays itself from the
turn. Uh, also I think when I see dunk
bet like 10% it's quite uh tempting to
fast play a king. Maybe it reduces some
value combos, you know.
&gt;&gt; So a bit similar to what you kind of
mentioned in that 10 hat 108 hand,
right? Like when you made that small bet
on the turn, you expect a bit more fast
play. So his range a bit weaker and we
can now capitalize on back. So kind of
similar here. You guess his range maybe
in practice is way more weighted towards
kings, queens, jacks than in theory, for
example, where he might still have love
ace king.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I guess I I guess you probably you
probably bluff or like something like
910 pocket pocket 10 910. I guess I
could see that sometimes bluffing maybe
in theory.
&gt;&gt; Maybe
six is
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sixes for sure. Like seven sixes
and seven six for sure. And then I guess
if you have 54,
you're already reaching quite a lot of
combos.
Yeah, also like with if we have ace
queen,
ace queen is a tricky hand to play here.
&gt;&gt; I guess I guess ace queen probably just
jams as well,
&gt;&gt; especially right if if we think ace king
raises flop. Yeah, I think also the
alternatives are not great. I think if
you have ace queen just just just going
for bet by bet is is quite a nice line.
&gt;&gt; Uh he does actually go ahead and make
the fold. Do you feel like especially
throughout the challenge at some point
you really had a good feel like hey my
blocks are getting through like I said
this every time when I go for thin value
they call me
&gt;&gt; yeah actually versus this guy uh I
wasn't sure I was just in the mood to
play like this I wouldn't run many
bluffs in personally
&gt;&gt; yeah this one you kind of got sucked in
like sometimes you know you have a plan
like okay don't bluff this guy but then
you get sucked into this situation like
how can I not bluff
&gt;&gt; yeah but you have to show them Samsung
as well
&gt;&gt; and uh this I think is plus CV blow.
&gt;&gt; All right, these were kind of the hands
that that I selected. Uh I wanted to uh
definitely thank you for coming on
