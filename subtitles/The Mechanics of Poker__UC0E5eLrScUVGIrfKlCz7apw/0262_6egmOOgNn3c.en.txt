aces. We obviously have all the all the

[01:47]
aces. We obviously have all the all the

[01:47]

sets that they're unlikely to have. So,

[01:50]
sets that they're unlikely to have. So,

[01:50]

these combos would three bet um, the guy

[02:15]
these combos would three bet um, the guy

[02:15]
these combos would three bet um, the guy
on cut off. So I think it's more kind of

kind of recognize a spot and be like,
"Hey, if you have two pair, it's a good

[05:44]
"Hey, if you have two pair, it's a good

"Hey, if you have two pair, it's a good
bluff. And then if you bluff all your

two pairs in sets, yeah, then it's

[05:47]
two pairs in sets, yeah, then it's

[05:47]
two pairs in sets, yeah, then it's
indeed a pretty okay spot to bluff. If

[05:49]
indeed a pretty okay spot to bluff. If

indeed a pretty okay spot to bluff. If
you did go fancy with, let's say, just

ace king, you do not have a straight,

[05:54]
ace king, you do not have a straight,

[05:54]
ace king, you do not have a straight,
but I don't think that really matters.

[05:56]
but I don't think that really matters.

[05:56]
but I don't think that really matters.
Would not people blend bluff a pretty

Would not people blend bluff a pretty
funky?"

[05:59]
funky?"

[05:59]
funky?"
&gt;&gt; No, it's kind of too random, I think.

[06:03]
&gt;&gt; No, it's kind of too random, I think.

[06:04]
&gt;&gt; No, it's kind of too random, I think.
&gt;&gt; I guess the 10 of spades doesn't really

[06:05]
&gt;&gt; I guess the 10 of spades doesn't really

[06:05]
&gt;&gt; I guess the 10 of spades doesn't really
have anything with the 10 of spades. I

[06:06]
have anything with the 10 of spades. I

[06:06]
have anything with the 10 of spades. I
guess only like 108 maybe or 10 nine. So

[06:09]
guess only like 108 maybe or 10 nine. So

[06:09]
guess only like 108 maybe or 10 nine. So
he act no 10 high is not even possible.

[06:11]
he act no 10 high is not even possible.

[06:11]
he act no 10 high is not even possible.
So it's either a royal flush with the

[06:13]
So it's either a royal flush with the

[06:13]
So it's either a royal flush with the
10. Now I guess I guess we're not really

[06:15]
10. Now I guess I guess we're not really

[06:15]
10. Now I guess I guess we're not really
afraid of a 10 high 10 eye flush, right?

[06:18]
afraid of a 10 high 10 eye flush, right?

[06:18]
afraid of a 10 high 10 eye flush, right?
Maybe only 108 108 of spades. Pocket t

[06:20]

probably gets it in pre flop or three

[06:22]
probably gets it in pre flop or three

[06:22]
probably gets it in pre flop or three
bets pre flop. So maybe only the ax were

[06:24]
bets pre flop. So maybe only the ax were

[06:24]
bets pre flop. So maybe only the ax were
actually worried about only the ace

[30:46]
It's a It's hard to find a bluff for me.

[30:46]
It's a It's hard to find a bluff for me.
Bluffs for me like sixes maybe. 10 N.

[30:50]
Bluffs for me like sixes maybe. 10 N.

[30:50]
Bluffs for me like sixes maybe. 10 N.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess seven six something like

[30:52]

that.

[30:53]
that.

[30:53]

but uh Zak that's so good. You I think

[30:59]
but uh Zak that's so good. You I think

[30:59]
but uh Zak that's so good. You I think
you can see you can continue like the

[31:01]
you can see you can continue like the

[31:01]
you can see you can continue like the
whole

[31:02]
whole

[31:02]
whole
&gt;&gt; and five for also it blocks like the A

[31:04]
&gt;&gt; and five for also it blocks like the A

[31:04]
&gt;&gt; and five for also it blocks like the A
blocks maybe an A4 suited that he for

[31:06]
blocks maybe an A4 suited that he for

[31:06]
blocks maybe an A4 suited that he for
bad. So he calls again.

[31:09]
bad. So he calls again.

[31:09]
bad. So he calls again.
&gt;&gt; River three. Well, your your bluffs are

[31:11]
&gt;&gt; River three. Well, your your bluffs are

[31:11]
&gt;&gt; River three. Well, your your bluffs are
getting less and less, right? If you had

[31:12]
getting less and less, right? If you had

[31:12]
getting less and less, right? If you had
a flush drawer, I guess it now also gets

[31:14]
a flush drawer, I guess it now also gets

[31:14]
a flush drawer, I guess it now also gets
there.

[31:15]
there.

[31:15]
there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of plays itself from the

[31:18]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of plays itself from the

[31:18]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of plays itself from the
turn. Uh, also I think when I see dunk

[31:21]
turn. Uh, also I think when I see dunk

[31:21]

bet like 10% it's quite uh tempting to

[31:25]
bet like 10% it's quite uh tempting to

[31:25]

fast play a king. Maybe it reduces some

[31:29]
fast play a king. Maybe it reduces some

[31:29]
fast play a king. Maybe it reduces some
value combos, you know.

[31:31]
value combos, you know.

[31:31]
value combos, you know.
&gt;&gt; So a bit similar to what you kind of

[31:32]
&gt;&gt; So a bit similar to what you kind of

[31:32]
&gt;&gt; So a bit similar to what you kind of
mentioned in that 10 hat 108 hand,

[31:35]
mentioned in that 10 hat 108 hand,

[31:35]
mentioned in that 10 hat 108 hand,
right? Like when you made that small bet

[31:36]
right? Like when you made that small bet

[31:36]
right? Like when you made that small bet
on the turn, you expect a bit more fast

[31:38]
on the turn, you expect a bit more fast

[31:38]
on the turn, you expect a bit more fast
play. So his range a bit weaker and we

[31:40]
play. So his range a bit weaker and we

[31:40]
play. So his range a bit weaker and we
can now capitalize on back. So kind of

[31:42]
can now capitalize on back. So kind of

[31:42]
can now capitalize on back. So kind of
similar here. You guess his range maybe

[31:44]
similar here. You guess his range maybe

[31:44]
similar here. You guess his range maybe
in practice is way more weighted towards

ace king.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

[31:50]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

[31:50]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I guess I I guess you probably you

[31:52]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I guess I I guess you probably you

[31:52]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I guess I I guess you probably you
probably bluff or like something like

[31:54]
probably bluff or like something like

[31:54]
probably bluff or like something like
910 pocket pocket 10 910. I guess I

[31:57]

[32:04]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sixes for sure. Like seven sixes

[32:04]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sixes for sure. Like seven sixes
and seven six for sure. And then I guess

[32:07]

if you have 54,

[32:08]
if you have 54,

[32:08]
if you have 54,
you're already reaching quite a lot of

[32:10]
you're already reaching quite a lot of

[32:10]
you're already reaching quite a lot of
combos.

[32:11]
combos.

[32:11]
combos.
Yeah, also like with if we have ace

[32:15]
Yeah, also like with if we have ace

[32:16]
Yeah, also like with if we have ace
queen,

[32:18]
queen,

[32:18]
queen,
ace queen is a tricky hand to play here.

[32:21]
ace queen is a tricky hand to play here.

[32:21]
ace queen is a tricky hand to play here.
&gt;&gt; I guess I guess ace queen probably just

[32:23]
&gt;&gt; I guess I guess ace queen probably just

[32:23]
&gt;&gt; I guess I guess ace queen probably just
jams as well,

[32:24]
jams as well,

[32:24]
jams as well,
&gt;&gt; especially right if if we think ace king

[32:26]
&gt;&gt; especially right if if we think ace king

[32:26]
&gt;&gt; especially right if if we think ace king
raises flop. Yeah, I think also the

[32:28]
raises flop. Yeah, I think also the

[32:28]
raises flop. Yeah, I think also the
alternatives are not great. I think if

[32:30]
alternatives are not great. I think if

[32:30]
alternatives are not great. I think if
you have ace queen just just just going
