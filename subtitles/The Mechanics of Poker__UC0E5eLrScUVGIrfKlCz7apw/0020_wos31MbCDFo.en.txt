yes yes yes yes yes yes
yes yes it was a long wait
but there's another [ __ ] stream
got the all types of goodness in one
bowl that's good for the
good recession energy we're gonna need
it
because probably as usual see it was in
the zoom pool
let me see who's in the zoom pool
um
that's a tough that's a that's a that's
a full zoom movement 81 entrances that's
good
and see some nice names out there tunas
shout out the tunas
so he's gonna check also quite strong on
a flush turn i have a feeling and then i
end up bluffing and then
basically looking ahead i didn't see
much good things happening across
and now tunis is trying to sneak in a
little three but here
against me with the ice cream suited
okay
yeah you're on fire
let's see let's see what tunis has got
seven deuce
he checks back okay okay okay
we're gonna apply some uh parachute
let's go for a 22 bet since we have the
nuts
why not
now the question is is he trapping me
with the jacks
paul please i want to unfit
to win the hand
let's see if he let's see on what level
he's gonna level
i think it's going to fall
yeah this is going to be a time expo oh
it cools
[Music]
me my feeling was correct my feeling was
correct
junos the legend slow rolls
okay i could i could appreciate a good
slow roll that was a good slow roll
oh there was still this slide there was
still this slight chance that he was
slow-rolling me
and he was he was indeed slow-rolling me
gg maybe i've overplayed my flush there
in hindsight
is this gonna be the is this gonna be
the hand that's gonna turn everything
around for us
is this going to be that hand we're
blocking jack then suited
so that's less unlikely which means we
could actually have the best hand he
starts with a one third and we are not
going anywhere
in a very good mood guys i'm in a very
good mood
no one is breaking my water
hey jax okay okay
let's see let's see
king river not the best of rivers
one
we're blocking kingdom hearts we're
blocking the jack and suited which has
now become sort of relevant
what could we be doing this with that
bluff we have already the 10th
f4 bad bluff like the queen dena hearts
the queen 10 of diamonds the 10 and a
hard
tanana diamond so that's already that's
less likely
if he has like a suit of days
i really get this sizing though
ace five of hearts blocking the jack
okay he
the jacks again it's the jacks
guys they really are trying to get us
broke here and we're gonna try to win a
pot from chips and crips which is
usually quite a bad idea but you know i
figured
check back flop
turn five quite decent quite decent
he calls up that we hit to bear what a
trouble
scenario this is
yeah don't get out gypsy come on do your
thing
how much how much
10 percent
ten percent doesn't really make much
sense
a race turnpiler why would you lead 10
percent
i guess he thinks he has no bluffs royal
flush
to be fair i wouldn't have called the
big bad so that's why a small bet does
make sense
what we're getting we're getting royal
flush guys
nice hand nice hand we were ahead on the
turn so it was a good value race to be
honest
are we gonna make it back with pocket
kings now that is the question
is this gonna be in the turnaround it
wasn't the pocket dance
is this then going to be the turnaround
guys is this gonna be it
considering sizing
make a little four bet here with the h3
let's see if that one gets through
he calls here with the ace queen
which is good as he now sometimes has a
screen
i'd like queen jack
some hands have now have some extra
equity i think i'm definitely going to
barrel
you could obviously still has f8 tents
oh river is a club
you have a king of clubs
[Music]
so he has eight pence one two three four
i think we're still shoving kings with a
club
praying guys praying
he snapped calls and he did indeed get
there oh my god
things was again not a turnaround hand
for us
important as i mentioned we basically
i was counting on the river basically i
was debating i mean eight is only one
combination
he could have fast played a different
eight
on the turn some of the time but that's
reduced he doesn't have much eight x
anyway maybe an eight seven suited
but i don't think so uh i thought ace
queen
suited was a likely hand that he would
always calm me down with
i think a hand like jax is also a fine
uh calling candidate
same with a hand like 10 jack suited or
maybe even ninth because like a lot of
broadway's miss
and i do think it's a river where we're
gonna be perceived to be quite polar i
mean i'm not jamming
uh anything without a club i guess
so actually i think it's a it's a good
jam i think
it could definitely be that if you're
down three binds in ten minutes
uh as as this plate which is kind of
gonna be the
uh the main takeaway of the session
how to grind out when you're done four
or five mines in in in the first
whatever streaming 25 minutes
could be that you're starting choking
this spot but i didn't do
pretty bad the phone player
not a good fob
doesn't really make me have a lot of fun
this flop i'm gonna check
in decent turn i would say as it's less
likely that he has a jack he bets half
pot
definitely continuing there is a very
small chance we hit a nine he has king
queen and we
get all the money in we do block jack 9
suited for what it's worth
and in general fun players yeah they
tend to be quite random
wouldn't be surprised to see pocket
deuces here so i think actually i would
prefer
calling nines over a hand like ace king
but again it's a spot where it's
it's it's exactly what i just explained
your brain friends is very hard
uh to understand products and especially
if you're on a streak
uh like we are at the moment a little
bit
where basically i don't think we have
won almost any showdown except for this
one actually
shout out to the pocket nines guys shout
out to the pocket nice let's celebrate
let's celebrate
the fact that we call them we're right
and that you know our showdowns are
starting to make some money
okay let's get our matchachee our
chocolate
then we're gonna then we're gonna win
some money back i'll do it
all right back and rolling
got the matcha tea got the chocolate
actually the chocolate always is
floating around my desk
we're going uganda style guys uganda 80
percent
and carmichael approved as always don't
do it don't do anything anymore that's
not adam carmichael
food do you think you need a certain
level of understanding of the game
already in order to
interpret everything that he says
oh baby we have a flush
we have a flush indeed we have a flush
and it's a good one
it doesn't really matter unless he has
exactly king nine
uh win yeah king nine
i think on a river we should just be
betting something like this
you think he could still possibly find
like a bluff race
that would not be bad folding there here
we are guys
here we are it's been a long time that
don't you combine in the little pajamas
let's see if yeah phone player the fun
player is going to get in our way or not
oh we get called forbid by the other
foot player
i cannot i just have to accept accept
lost
gg except loss i cannot do anything here
my goal is going to jam the flop and
then
no playability
[Music]
okay okay
uh-oh jack
check
now we're okay getting it in
it checks again
let's see three bed check check
trying to think if what to do actually
i think now i should probably go get
some value
but you could still be trying to trap me
and usually checking the ace his highs
here is not a bad strategy
ah yeah yeah yeah yeah
okay
it's deuce okay
maybe it was wrong with me to be that
unhappy but i didn't really view it
hmm
make a little lead here with the h10
we have a lot of pairs now
so
he bets the river
i know what you guys are thinking
i'm thinking exactly the same
ah tree bear
wow we have a lot of action guys it's
going crazy
hmm let's drink turn don't want to get
check raised
not really sure how this place
could actually consider probably
checking without a club i think that's
probably
a valid option
shhh
i think we're gonna i think we're gonna
win a stack here
i think we're gonna win a stack here
why didn't he lead the river it would
have been so much nicer
but what is my blast here my plus will
basically be and like queen ten
tents or jacks would kind of be like a
funky bluff here
and they become crazy man which to me
fair i am a little so
let's see how crazy the mirror thinks i
am
come on man i got the 810.
come on call me we're unstuck i'm gonna
go to the gym with a happy smile on my
face
no actually we're never unstuck man
that's impossible
oh that's so unfortunate
overall guys i'm actually quite
satisfied with how i played quite
satisfied as involved with how we
responded to the bad start of the
session because basically within
what is within 40 now within
20 minutes yeah within 20 minutes we
were down four binds
then we actually after that actually i
think we
yeah i think we turn it around quite
decently actually i'm quite happy
with how we proceeded this session we
didn't let that
throw us off we stayed
we stayed in the zone even though
even though things weren't really going
our way i would say
i think that's about it i want to wish
you guys a lot of luck at the tables
thank you for sticking around
while we were trying to get unstuck and
good luck at davis and see you guys next
