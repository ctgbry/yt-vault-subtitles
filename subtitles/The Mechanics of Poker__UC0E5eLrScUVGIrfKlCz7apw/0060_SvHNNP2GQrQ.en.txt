the house here here he's sitting jared
so everyone is here checking back the
eight nine so everyone is here to have
some fun
okay
place it back with the eight nine
which is perfectly fine we're gonna go

[01:01]
which is perfectly fine we're gonna go
not too thrilled about the river but i
think we're still falling
he checks well in that case we check as
well
yes queen jack he gave up the river guys
let's start it off straight away a

[01:15]
let's start it off straight away a
little chicken sound for mister
[Music]
well lucy gucci stuff actually had a
jack queen of him
has to be said

[01:32]
already check on this board
i was going to check race maybe actually
i still am excited still one
that was my plan
[Music]

[01:45]
[Music]
turn is quite dicey
interesting river
i think now i have to check i think who
has most sevens is probably cesano

[02:03]
little does he know that we have
the seven and the eight okay
any gems okay thank you zazano
yeah my friend that's very lucky that's

[02:16]
yeah my friend that's very lucky that's
very unlucky
that's very unlucky mrs azano how sick
is that
how sick is that
it's a very big bat
i like his sizing don't think we can

[02:30]
i like his sizing don't think we can
fold the gutter to the nuts
yet though
i'm gonna call but definitely gonna do
quite some folding here
interesting turn
do you think he could still just bat ace
king or something for that sizing
go will lead

[02:46]
go will lead
this is a very this is a very
interesting spot
on turner river
now i do think we should be betting just
going to go for the small bed but i'm
not really liking this situation

[03:01]
hey folks i call here with the ace queen
interesting turn
probably a turn i'm gonna be jamming
facing the barrel

[03:16]
it doesn't barrel
uh definitely a spot i'm going to be
betting
gonna be betting half patty
jams which i think is a very good play
we thought that's chopped versus
ace queen so we have to call but

[03:32]
ace queen so we have to call but
check james is king
of clubs when he gets there what the
[ __ ]
can i even play in this game i mean what
the [ __ ] they find oh i mean what the
i mean how can i even

[03:46]
i mean how can i even
play in this game it's like i just get
cheated i mean hand after hand after
hand on the [ __ ] livable echo here on
the flop easy check out again here on
turn well you know at least at least

[04:01]
turn well you know at least at least
it's going to tunis
i'm happy that's going to tunis
river
we got called by queen 10 make a little
call here and poker face

[04:17]
call here and poker face
straight away
gets his feet wet with a little clicking
back we're going to try to outdraw him
by flopping a set
because that's what we do here on screen
i am lucky
i am skillful and i will win you got to

[04:31]
i am skillful and i will win you got to
feel it
[Laughter]
set over set let's go oh he calls as
well if this ain't a setup we said guys
then i don't know what is

[04:46]
this is the time that i'm just gonna rip
my stacking guys pay very much attention
guys this is how you make a lot of money
playing poker
okay it won't fall then we're gonna cool
it this guy set over set

[05:06]
or he has a flush draw and then he's
just gonna fall
oh you're thinking about it quite long
is he really considering folding a set
now right
he thinks i'm flushing

[05:18]
no he falls i hope he didn't fold the
set right that that would that would be
ridiculous
okay so apparently this was not
showing you guys how to make money i

[05:30]
showing you guys how to make money i
feel i feel like i'm gonna get a
balancing question
no i usually have a set
okay
or like if you want to if you want to
jam a hand i think like six five suited
or something would make a lot of sense
six five suited six seven suited type of
holdings

[05:45]
holdings
i think those would make most sense i'm
gonna call it through right here with
the pack sixes and flop a set
shouldn't overuse that ah
at some point doesn't work anymore

[06:04]
but we still have a call versus a small
sizing
in the bed small
there's a barrel tough spot

[06:16]
tough spot tough spots
things okay okay call again but not that
happy

[06:30]
jams
okay
interesting
we will have rivered quite some aces
aside flush draw
we will have some jacks i don't think we
have to call this hand

[06:50]
i think six is no hard on the turn i
think it's still
called the eighth six gonna be flop

[07:04]
a barrel a turn
and try to get some goddamn money in
with two pair
what is a big blind how much is the word
in dollar so one big blind depends so

[07:16]
in dollar so one big blind depends so
one big blind here is 20 as you can see
20 bucks 10 bucks 50 bucks
and then the other three tables
one big blind
is 10 so we're playing 5 10 and 10 20.

[07:34]
the reason most or at least most
professional poker players that i know
play in big blinds because if you play
across for example three stakes
it kind of saves some brain power to not

[07:45]
it kind of saves some brain power to not
every time i have to calculate how big
you're gonna three but how big you're
gonna or how big something is
but then playing in big blind makes it a
little bit easier that's various
requests some people prefer big blind
some people prefer dollars
but especially because now
i'm kind of giving you guys an insight

[08:01]
i'm kind of giving you guys an insight
in my normal grind
obviously i take this a little bit more
serious than the 500 zoom grind
a little three but here with the five
our favorite five four suited
let's see if this flop

[08:17]
and i'm gonna bet again on the turn
oh now we make
prepare and i think the only thing to do
is bet again

[08:31]
100 actually i think in hindsight the
check would have been nicer
hindsight poker god damn it guys we
should really start thinking a bit more
about our decisions
yeah that was a badly played hand the
5'4 i think

[08:45]
5'4 i think
check calling is way better
why do you think players choose such
silly user names
on every other side then poke says yeah
good question

[09:01]
[Music]
calling the flop turn a pair don't think
we actually really needed the pair

[09:16]
what's already used for the table of
lace they look amazing i love the dark
layout i think we have layout some tacky
i see someone putting in the attack
there's a barrel here
definitely should be defending like
some of my lower pairs here probably

[09:32]
some of my lower pairs here probably
sixes
sevens
fives no diamond probably being
preferred
now we

[09:47]
have a down call as i think he can
be betting the same hand and obviously
we block the nut flush
and we unblock certain blocks let's say
as king jack suited or something

[10:03]
he gave up the river with jack ate
he gave up the river so mean mommy gave
up the ricker let's go
little chicken some for you my friend

[10:25]
flop a set
set aimbed

[10:36]
actually used to
back in the days i used to only play on
who till
that was back back back in the days
while we get check raised by mr

[10:45]
while we get check raised by mr
bieber
okay
we are
quite happy to see that
we're gonna go
not the best of turns
but obviously we're not going anywhere
he checks him probably betting he blocks

[11:01]
he checks him probably betting he blocks
himself
river is quite interesting
that's three quarters i think for three
cards we just have a call and
hope he doesn't have better
yet ace eight ace eight

[11:17]
son i would tell you this much son i
would never put more three thousand with
two times oh here we go
ace eight off suit we got out drawn by
suit can i even play in this game i mean
what the [ __ ] they find oh i mean what

[11:30]
what the [ __ ] they find oh i mean what
the
check raised the flop with ace eight off
suit made it straight on the turn
idiot players call races with queen ten
they don't even know how to spell poker
i mean
now this guy outdraws me at the ace
queen of spades on 5 8 10 and he hit ace

[11:45]
queen of spades on 5 8 10 and he hit ace
10. here we flop two pair which is nice
we make a little check raising
somewhere in between six
and i think we're gonna pop the turn

[12:04]
and jamming the river
but i thought about checking there for a
little moment
which i don't
i wouldn't have hated actually

[12:16]
i wouldn't have hated actually
they called me down with five street
suited so luckily i didn't check
five three suited
son i would tell you this much son i
would never have put more 3000 with two
tons well here we go i was going to say

[12:31]
tons well here we go i was going to say
hi three student guys
[Music]
here we made trips decide to draw a
little slowplay

[12:46]
little slowplay
about a club i would definitely check
raise
if i had queen nine plus i would also
definitely check raise
actually guys we have to close one table
uh

[13:01]
uh
so we just leave with the
with the german semi fish actually we
face a barrel here
i think i'm
we flop actually quite a good hand here

[13:16]
river is an ace i think we have a gem
now
seven ace
yes
i'm willing false
three bet ace king

[13:30]
three bet ace king
wow i'll tell you i'll tell you what
happened with the tents really sad and
sad guy
the [ __ ]
with three videos with the ace queen
a scream we're gonna check

[13:46]
skiing we're definitely barreling
a screen we're gonna check again
and in the meanwhile my coach which is
myself from the pastor in the future

[14:01]
myself from the pastor in the future
however you want to call it
he tells me that we should maybe
consider taking a break
there's a little delayed bed here with
the a screen calling
here we have easy jam on the river

[14:22]
that's what we're gonna do
and hope big blind bets calls us that
he's just tired of
what's going on

[14:40]
and he also bats here oh poor big blind
batsman poor big blind bats he's really

[14:45]
batsman poor big blind bats he's really
in oh and he hero calls us with the
eight nine guys hero colors with the a9
he's completely tired he's like this
wacko guy
this record guy's completely crazy now
should we then
jam it in here hmm i think that's a good

[15:00]
jam it in here hmm i think that's a good
idea
he's tilt
he is on life tilt
and it's raining money guys
it is raining
money

[15:15]
money
it's raining
[Music]
little seven dudes heads up

[15:30]
oh face it three bet
okay guys let's go seven oh we flop a
flush draw we flop a [ __ ] flesh here
i just show them drunken style and i
think it's good for poker like bring

[15:45]
think it's good for poker like bring
some fun enjoyment
get your daughter cabana piano without
guys because we have a [ __ ] flush
roll
who is a big batman on the turn
i don't think we can fold a naked flush
draw
interesting river

[16:03]
or are we gonna lose the stack with the
seven news
because if he checks we're obviously
shipping it in
oh
okay boys
this is that moment

[16:20]
one time let's go
oh
fault oh my god

[16:32]
ace king induced
we're right here with the jacks
there's a four bet gonna be calling

[16:49]
interesting it checks back
i think i'm definitely stabbing the turn

[17:01]
i'm probably jamming the river
then i guess hoping
that we are not getting trapped
but that jackson is just good that's
kind of what we're hoping for

[17:19]
i didn't snap so probably jax are good
now you can call my friend
now i'm happy
he called ace king
ace king [ __ ] high ace king high echo

[17:34]
ace king [ __ ] high ace king high echo
ace king hi
hey
[Music]

[17:46]
if they don't want the money then we
take the money
will there be any content or course for
yes we there will be content for entity
players in the future
but hey let's start the

[18:01]
start with the things that we actually
know how to do
over by the
turn and going to over but the river

[18:16]
turn and going to over but the river
and he's thinking thinking thinking
thinking thinking thinking thinking

[18:36]
this is really weird

[18:45]
he checked back king jack on the flop
hey
he missed clicked flop
it's one of these weird spots like
you're getting a great price but yeah
does anyone ever bluff there

[19:00]
does anyone ever bluff there
i thought maybe like a seven eight
suited or something that was like okay
yeah you're probably you you can bluff
so then i'll just raise small to fold
out your plus something like that
a really weird spot
barrelling unless the turn is a broadway

[19:15]
barrelling unless the turn is a broadway
oh okay so check race well this guy
probably has a nut so a three on the
turn would be very nice okay i am lucky
i
we did improve with some equity so if he
doesn't bet too big
and we're definitely tagging along

[19:32]
that's that's very welcoming okay okay
okay okay okay i am lucky
i am
oh to bear but
then to purpose this guy

[19:46]
i would like a check
oh you probably have the best and he
probably says ace jack or something
or is king
ace king one time
ace king ace king ace king

[20:03]
ace king ace king ace king
oh he folds okay guys then we're gonna
end it at the fold
