how are you guys today
let kings let's learn
today as you might see
we are live because when i speak you
respond i can immediately respond as
well which usually means that if i now
start playing people can see my whole
cards which means that we're not playing
ah but i do have
something else for you guys in pedo
which is some 40k and l
okay
big boy steaks
okay
no [ __ ]
baby money so dumb
that's why you play this baby money
limit you [ __ ] dunk
no baby money here my friend no baby
money here this is real money from what
i understood
this guy armando de vano my maltese uh
maltese friend melamela
he uh won quite some money in a
tournament and decided that a lineup of
mike boyfin linuslove
kevin pk
and
think true teller
not 100 sure they play super deep
any major
strategy shift except the value of
suited connect is going up
uh yes there's definitely a
major strategy shift
as when you're that deep you're likely
so let's say they they are both going to
be deep right so obviously power of
position will count more
and uh
you're often going to like you cannot
really get the money in before the river
which usually means that you're gonna
usually play all streets
and that's something that you have to
take in consideration that you're more
often going to see a river
and for example a big difference is as
well especially when making a riverbed
out of position let's say you're 100 bp
right you play a three bad pot you're
three bats you bet the flop bad turn you
jam river or suddenly it's two of the bb
deep it it's bad flop bad turn bad river
he raises all in
that's an extra line that will decrease
the v of the outer position player right
because he suddenly has an extra option
you're no longer closing the action
little three bet cold format here
actually from linus
expect to see a very small c bet
closer range on this king-high board and
i don't think there's much
that
mikey boyfriend here can do about it
indeed the small seabed takes place and
expect a fault
and that's kind of how poker works
in a four by path on a king high board
there's a little squeeze here from kevin
gonna isolate mr armando her mother are
not afraid let's see if uh
this is a good board for armando in
terms of sad advantage as i think kevin
would not squeeze deuces force eight but
armando would definitely call so
there is a
there's a set advantage and this is also
in terms of someone asked about playing
deep stack so let's say
let's say you're playing 30 big blinds
okay in this spot
then
let's say his range remains the same
obviously things might change a little
bit but then the fact that he sometimes
has a set is like okay gg you know and
overpass just the nuts whereas the
deeper you get the more the overpair is
not the nuts okay
so
like here already 150 bbd bit becomes a
little bit uh
a little bit dangerous but let's see
what happens
luckily for uh kevin he's uh probably a
little bit wider he does actually start
with a with a check definitely another
range that board for the reasons that i
just gave in general someone has a lot
of strong hands in his range it's not a
good idea especially the deeper you get
to start investing a lot of money in
that pot
armando starts with a little bet
and i don't expect kevin ever to have a
folding range rangers this sizing
need to bend more of your nuts i mean
you need the better nuts
not completely true actually but yeah
getting money in with the nuts
whatever stack size uh
it's probably a good idea but yeah the
deeper you get the more you want to play
lines
when you have the nuts
and that nuts is most likely to stay in
nuts
you want to take lines that get the
money in right
don arty says
very proud and happy to see that kevin
made it he used to play with him in
rotterdam in the casino 2015 he said
this line is used to flatten as well and
you actually have a little three of
potter going on
kevin is uh
isolating miss armando which is gonna do
quite often
six ten do seven the board starts to uh
run out a little bit in this area but
definitely a spot where uh
kevin should look to still get a lot of
value gets a call now armando
okay it's an eight river yeah
yeah
for the people uh we're a fan of dunk
dunking i do see like for example i had
like [ __ ] dates or pocket knights
being more likely in armando's range
than kevin
same with a hand like 7 8 suited
6-7 suited for that matter
910 suited i would say
kevin doe has more ace nine suited maybe
king nine suited
i think it's a bit divided but i would
say we would probably have a leading
range here if we're out of position okay
not all people agree you [ __ ] dunk
you do it again i remember in a video
before i've told you to not dunk why do
you do that why do you do that so dumb
but yeah let's see if armando listens to
the wacko and draws a little donkey dunk
or if he listens to mr gordon
it doesn't draw a little donkey dunk he
checks
no donkey dunk
maybe he just says like ace 10 king 10
and like 6'5 would be a good bluff
he's a bit wider probably so he would
also have a6 also an okay bluff
i guess in practice we could maybe turn
like 10 jack or something into a bluff
as we don't really gonna have
a6 suited so
these
interesting might
could check jam the turn
and kevin has king 10 off so kevin
definitely going after him not a
you know not a very gto 3 bet clearly
this is a deliberate deviation from the
quote unquote correct okay
all right deliberate deviation okay if
it's deliberate you know then then you
can do anything hey wreck i have a
question
in some spots where we should polarize
our range why some players use 66 and
some 75 percent
because for that sizing they are already
sort of polarizing
it depends it's certain boards
there are spots where you polarize
towards a bigger sizing but you don't
want to go bigger because
you're a bit capped
that's in a theory a spot where you do
want to polarize but your opponent
remains uncapped
then you
don't want to go too big we get a little
puppet here on turn by kevin
do you need help explaining what the
hell goes on in these videos well then
poker ambition is the place to go to
re-offer various servers for various
levels of players go over to our site
programmation.com to find out more
waco trying to optimize my schedule
recently been waking up at five that's
early grinding a four hours even more
followed by studying hey
that's exactly sort of what i'm doing
only i'm playing for three to four hours
followed by selling do you think playing
30 hours a week is enough
should we no you should not be looking
to grind more so grinding more is never
in my opinion
it's not not the solution at lower
stakes you should always focus on
improving for people who didn't follow
my
my webinar the free webinar i gave
let me
put it up for you guys
uh where did i put that one
so i gave a free webinar for the people
who missed it and in there i explained
something
about the
strategies of a grinder
versus the investor
it's good
very good advice i'll put it right here
this is the sheet let me zoom out so it
fits on screen
can we read it like this no let me put
it to this screen
there you can see it right yes this
should make sense
can everyone see it
so we had the short-term grinder and the
investor basically
the example that i gave is guys and a
lot of people are gonna be the
short-term grinders basically you guys
play a lot of hands especially early on
because you think need to make volume
you know you've heard someone say volume
you don't want to be lazy right it's
like oh you only play four hours a day
you lazy [ __ ]
no listen not necessarily how it works
often if you look at the total volume
someone plays let's say for example you
play eight hours a day can guarantee you
that the last two hours of your session
you will make maybe
25 of your normal win rate
at maximum so usually the last two hours
of your session just don't play them and
invest them in studying would already be
a greater idea but basically the example
that i gave is the guy plays 60 000
hands so twice the amount of volume as
the investor he plays more tables so
quality goes down win rate goes down but
you know he definitely in the beginning
makes more money than the investor right
because the investor only plays half of
the volume
but because he only plays off the volume
has a little bit of a higher win rate
because he may place less tables but
also he spends more time in trying to
improve himself right trying to study
trying to get better just like i just
showed you how i use gto wizard uh
export my hands see if i can improve get
a couple of focus points for next
session improve improve improve the
person who does that better will make it
in the end so this guy as we can see the
investor i think after a year or so they
are making around the same money per
month
yes and then in the end he made
like 50 more money or something than the
short-term grinder right short-term
grinder in the beginning maybe more but
the investor invested that's why it's
called an investor in the long run so in
my opinion
your whole strategy in the beginning
should be based up on how can i get to
mid stakes 510 in my opinion that should
always be the goal how can i get there
and then from there you could maybe look
at okay what's best for my hourly for
example right
ah so it's kev
race
three bet here lioness saw the kingdom
off there with kevin he's like
[ __ ] you man
we're gonna go a little bit wider than
gto here
all right that's how exploitation works
right you identify that someone doesn't
play quote quote correct aka gto
therefore you can start exploiting so
definitely would go a lot wider here
because he's opening too wide he's three
betting too wide so you should hold four
but wider as well or at least that's the
opportunity if you want to just stick
with your own strategy that's fine as
well but that's not maximizing
this board
i think we can see some health pots
and some more checks compared to the
king 10 4 like the king 10 4 all the way
in the beginning in a four by pot
king-eye boards in general just just
nail you so you can just see that a lot
for small sizing there's nothing filling
can do here usually we do want to
size a little bit bigger because the
board is lower
that's legit
300 300 pots yeah that's
that's exactly what someone said right
about the polarization story so we did
see like a 40 not at one third whereas
on the other board he just bet at 4k
here he sizes up to 8k this is a big pot
and it's three-way
ah okay so it's a squeeze
the line is a little cold call okay you
think he uses the gavin smith flat call
guys
the next tip i want to tell you about
let me explain it's what i consider to
be my strongest weapon in no limit texas
holder
it's called the flat call
so i basically will flat call with just
about anything before the flop
so my boy raises pre-flop
i see two kings
i flat call
for the next time when my boy raises up
pre-flop
i look down i've got the 6'4 off suit
i want to call then too
a flat call and it's gonna be the same
regardless and they can decide whether
or not this is which time it is
that way is always the opponent guessing
whether this is the time gavin's calling
with the big hand or this is the time
he's just trying to hit a flop to snap
somebody off
yes yes yes
the stream only gets more educational
actually we saw a checker on the 3-4
queen
which is pretty interesting i guess the
queen does hit linus quite well but the
trees and fours
it's probably not in their pre-flop
especially given the fact that he was
already shorter
i guess
i think we should just see that range
because basically yes he will have some
queens and now he did i see that's for
the small sizing
i guess
i will just go again for
he plays his hand and he has jacks
even though it is very unlikely given
the river is now a jack
it's quite simple if he now checks i
think he has tents
if he bats he has jacks
that's i think out of spot now place
don't fall for it lioness yes you beat
of course linus knows hey wacko what do
you think is the best site for micro
stakes players right now actually this
is quite interesting i just got off a
call
and in general i get this question quite
often and soon actually i think of i
will soon make a post on our on our blog
people don't follow our blog guys
there's a lot of [ __ ] good knowledge
out there go over to poker ambition.com
i don't know stair slash blog
actually i have no clue let me check
poker ambition
vlog yeah poker mission slash blog guys
this is the blog
you got the the late gratification hey
what's up
someone pointed me out shout out to that
guy he said listen the delay
gratification i said listen me and my
friends were a big fan of your posts all
right but the late latest one
grammatically speaking it was so bad we
couldn't reach it read it and then i
then i looked normally if i write it
which
you know i write it
but then it usually gets sent
to someone else
right and he checks it but that didn't
happen and my grammar sucks
i mean
don't betting is my skill not writing in
any language whether that's english
dutch or portuguese
so but yeah we have some
posts there
we have
lessons learned dueco says edition all
the weka says guys amazing stuff
principles a lot of good knowledge in
there a lot more and i will add
i will actually add a post here and
maybe even add a link somewhere about a
good guide to players beginning
uh
to play poker where to play how you know
their strategy like i said they talk a
bit about the investment strategies gto
wizard has a built-in security feature
where if you run live scenarios while
playing it ah that's great man so
actually ah that's actually i didn't
know about that but that would actually
be a really a really cool move from gto
wizard as well
if they if they did that
they actually thought about that
normally i think the pro they normally
programs or businesses i think would
just put that responsibility with the
site
you know yeah that's a problem of the
site but if they actually did that i
think that's very good yeah exactly now
this is exactly what happens this is
exactly what happens what only height
said they have they everyone's hand
industries just get tracked and if you
get too close to gto
they they put you under investigation
remember guys that was our our marketing
scheme weka was too close to gto so they
banned me
i had it open accident actually i had
the same one time yeah
right after the session i realized the
browser still let it open
but yeah i mean i didn't have the
browser open anyway
unibet poker is raining with a party of
36. thank you very much
don't read up that i said i recommended
so recommended unibet and then i
re-recommended not to not because of
unibad if you want to have a good
uh
soft game especially for lower stakes i
think it's a very cool side to play on i
like the graphics i like the software
they definitely leveled out the player
player field for the recreationals but i
said in terms of if you're a
professional
and from what i know you cannot really
track data so you cannot really review
your own game
so if you want to get better then i
wouldn't recommend uh
playing there
but i think especially for lower stakes
players recreational players
someone who takes it semi seriously who
doesn't necessarily want to climb up the
whole poker mountain i think it's
definitely a great choice
what happened here check call check
check that river
hey
sizing sizing again i don't really think
let me see imposition on the turn is
definitely going to be bot controlling
sometimes like ace king
i don't really think this is a sizing
that's going to be used
all that often
but
let's check it out
king
nine
seven
check
no donks of course range bet as sort of
expected
for small sizing that's i think what
they also did
and turn so call
turn jack
check
a skiing indeed checking as expected
check
river is a queen right
this is not it doesn't really feel like
the
correct sizing
so actually it's again i expect indeed a
lot of way more smaller bats i think
that again makes way more sense
because basically you can sort of better
range like the only hand that doesn't
want to bat
is
ace queen suited
so yeah again i think it's a bad sizing
that
it's used
with
his hand
and i think the opportunity usually for
imposition here is just to
we saw that last time also with the asia
i would say that again then he has value
i think the most likely value had is
ninth
or tense
[Music]
and again we face a little race here
from uh
uh from eunice just like he raced when
it was the a's jack
i mean mutants have so many tents as
well a pocket tents
jack 10 suited king 10 suited tends that
the outer position has less as he
doesn't really
here we can see on the river he doesn't
always have tents doesn't always have
king then he almost never has jack then
he never has a stand
so i actually had a bluff interesting
as for bluff i think it's
yeah doesn't really feel uh
do right
