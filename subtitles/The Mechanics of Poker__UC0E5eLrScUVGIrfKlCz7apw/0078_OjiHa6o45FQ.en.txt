and it will analyze and give you
feedback on all the hands you played
so now we're going to find out guys how
gto
is the wacko really
[Music]
pay attention guys we have currently
opened up a limited amount of spots for
free
one-on-one coaching with me and adam
for the people who now join the
mechanics of poker program
so are you ready to improve your game go
over to the site and sign up to the
mechanics of poker program
we have found ourselves lucky as we spot
a rare sighting
it's the wacko in its natural habitat
he's sleeping waiting for another day of
hunting
he needs always strength for what's to
come
very good morning everyone to this first
episode
of life the waco
we could maybe do something with the
title this is the place where it all
starts off
the place where the magic happens and as
always in the morning
the first thing we have to do is figure
out if maybe we'll get lucky
will we get lucky
okay no luck today guys no luck today
let's save it for the poker tables so in
this video
i wanted to kind of bring you guys up to
speed of what has been going on
in my life okay ambition grinding
content creation coaching courses etc
etc
decided to start this vlog right after i
woke up apparently that's the thing now
good morning just take you guys
through the day today
first let's have some breakfast let out
the dog
and then they can start
[Music]
so
[Music]
i actually attempted to do a couple of
more drone shots
but unfortunately it is gg
drone so i hope the ones that are in it
were much appreciated
so it's been a little bit over a half
year now since that we opened up poker
ambition to the public
and then i blew up the dust of my poker
skills
and returned back to the 500 nl zoom
tables
now the mingle we had in the beginning
when we started to play poker again
was to gather as much information as
possible
about our current game now what this
tends to do
is it puts you in a bit more of an
observer mode while playing
making you less experienced the emotions
so let's say for example i make a
certain mistake
i might be like interesting this is a
mistake
i apparently make so this is new
information that i can use
to become a better poker player in the
future it's way different than you just
sit down you make the mistake and you
let go like oh [ __ ] why do i make this
mistake blah blah blah
you're way more emotional evolved so it
creates some distance
another thing that's very important is
to manage your expectations since i
hadn't played consistently for over two
years
i had to acclime my expectations
according to that
so not the wacko the ego the high sex
boss comes back to play and it's gonna
crush everyone but no
rekko hasn't played in a little while
let's see what comes up
don't create any weird expectations that
i'm just gonna sit down
and that my old game returns and that i
will just crush everyone
if you do have that expectation and you
sit down and the reality shows you
something different
this is the root cause of frustration so
expectation management and seeing the
reality as
this is super important in not tilting
and people have been mentioning this
wow wacko it seems like we never tilt
and that is indeed correct and this is
kind of
these two things are kind of the secret
another thing i noticed
was actually because of twitch i want to
start by giving up a little shout out to
the twitchers
because twitching brings with it a whole
another set of kind of mental game and
performance
issues i kind of compare twitching to
stripping down naked at a stage
you walk off the stage you take off your
clothes you open your
your your relax and say listen guys this
is it judge me for who i am
you're putting yourself in a really
vulnerable place open for anyone to
judge you now also before twitching i
also thought about this
and how i would respond to that and you
also notice that your ego comes around
the corner it's really interesting to
see
but yeah this also means that you are
multitasking you're playing
and you're managing the chat and playing
a couple of cool clips along the way
so let's say for example normally you
have 100 of your brain
capacity ready to make a decision it's
now maybe only 75
because you have other things to think
about so usually these are things that
will not lead to better decision making
another thing that i noticed was maybe a
little bit paranoia i thought especially
when it came down to
not falling through on a bluff that is
maybe a gto bluff or not hero calling
or hero folding handed in gtos for
example always a call
these were things that i was a little
bit more skeptic about in the beginning
and would get a little bit more paranoid
chicken song for the weko and now the
thing that everyone is curious about
weko how did you actually do in your 500
now zoom journey
and i'm gonna repeat it again i'm not
really a big fan of results people
usually go to results to get some sort
of confirmation about how they
how they have been doing while this is
completely not accurate
you need a very big sample for your
results to actually give a good
reflection
of how well you played it's way better
to look at certain tendencies like i
said i get a certain information in the
beginning
out of that game certain session goals
like for example i was a bit too big of
a station in certain areas and was maybe
trying a little bit too hard to win
certain pots
and i was trying to kind of tone that
down in certain areas in my game
this is something that i've been
tracking which i know will lead to
better results
and the big problem with result is if
you associate a good session
with you being a good player and a bad
session with you being a bad player
this will lead to a lot of fluctuations
in your confidence in the end
if you have stable confidence you will
perform more consistently and in the end
in the end
consistency is key so take control over
your confidence and start to let go of
results dollar-wise and start to track
other things in your game that will lead
you to make more money at the tables
please please yeah weko you're only
saying that because you're losing
no that's not the case so these are my
actual zoom results
since i started playing and as you can
see we're winning her a little bit over
around 2bb-ish
i remember in the beginning i think like
the first 30k hands we were down
and i ran some quick filters in
estimating the variance and for example
what i saw is that with my premium
holdings i was winning only half of what
i could be winning
same with big pots my win world was
definitely lacking so in
general if you can do anything right but
if
with premium holdings things are not
really going your way either you don't
build big pots against worse hands
or you only build big bots against
better hands which kind of was happening
in that sample
in my game yeah you're not going to win
guys in the end you know
queens kings asus ace king they make you
quite a big part of your money
and in around february march we also
launched our new coaching program the
mechanics of poker
now we have been working on that program
for almost a year and we're very happy
with how it turned out we're getting
amazing responses of guys who went
through the program
and you can really see their philosophy
and the way they look at the game
starting to change with which they are
making more progress in their poker
careers
we've also released our first
masterclass which was on three bad pods
out of position
currently finishing up small blind
unopened and basically this is the
most in-depth dive into a spot that you
will ever
see back to poker at some point we
left the 500 nl zoom streets to play
more 5 10
and 10 20. this is the moment where we
could put our gathered information that
we
tried to implement into our games to the
test on a little bit tougher opponents
this was also the time that i kind of
started to play a little bit more off
stream
and started to take my grind a little
bit more serious
and with that actually came a couple of
interesting things
when i wasn't playing on stream i would
maybe be a little bit too serious
i know it's it's weird but true uh i was
like okay
now we're not streaming so now i'm
really gonna pay attention now i'm
really gonna play good and what then
kind of happens is you put a little bit
too much pressure on your performance
and actually i saw bill lewinsky on a
cfp group he actually posted an
interesting article which showed that
if athletes were told to perform at 100
they were actually performing less than
if they told the athletes to perform
only at 80 percent
basically your ideal performance mindset
is a little bit more relaxed
whereas if you really want to 100 do the
correct place
you're actually only setting yourself a
portfolio because you're putting way too
much pressure on your shoulders
and you're gonna be way too tensed okay
you cannot really perform freely
so a little bit of a free tip for you
guys also since now it was getting a
little bit more competitive and my
competitive drive would come up
uh there were a lot of things that i
wanted to be doing
to perform better or to prepare better
for
playing in these games that i didn't
really have the time to do
because there's still a lot of things
around it that i had to take care of
whereas in the past it was just listen i
have one mission that's to become the
best poker player possible
and this is what i'm gonna dedicate all
my time to every day for example was
exactly the same
i didn't have to think about my days now
i noticed okay there's too much things
going on so i actually had to schedule
better
what i was gonna do and which day
because in the end guys
you can reach anything but you cannot do
everything okay this is a quote that
always sticks with my head when i try
because i often fall for this i
try to do everything and i'm a little
bit of a perfectionist so when i do
something i try to do it good
and when you want to do something good
you have to put a lot of time in that
and that usually means
spending less time on the other thing so
i noticed myself sometimes going a
little bit too much towards poke
ambition too much towards own poker
career
and then kind of if one part was
excelling like for example poker mission
was doing well or poker was doing well
then the other part would be missing out
and i would kind of be like oh [ __ ] but
i also want to do this
so this is actually going to be a
constant juggle for me
and it's really trying to find peace
and again aligning the expectation in
that your performance is gonna suffer a
little bit because you're not going 100
for one thing and this is maybe also a
part where maybe like some external
pressure comes in or at least pressure
that
i i put in my head because people want
to see you be the best poker player but
people also want to see you be the best
coach
make the best content be the best
twitcher the best the best the best the
best
while the truth is you cannot really be
the best in everything you can strive to
do your best
but the fact is that if you would
dedicate all your time to one goal
you would excel way further in that goal
than if you would be dividing your
attention but don't get me wrong i'm
very happy where things are going
making very good progress in all areas
of life
definitely notice also that my game is
going in the right direction every month
i feel like i really started to play
better
for the result oriented people i will
share my results right now
as you can see we're winning over a
little bit more than three bb 100
and very important guys as you can see i
chose very wisely on which state to run
good
it's a very very very important skill
so what now what can we expect from
poker ambition
from the weko from these vlogs well
poker ambition is about to launch its
academy in which you will be receiving
weekly seminars in general we're trying
to create our
portfolio in a way that will be adding
value to any level of poker player
starting off with for example twitch
youtube obviously a great place to start
and for beginning players then the next
step would be the academy
where you can really grow as a player
then obviously we have our main coaching
program which is the mechanics of
poker there you can really excel and get
the most out of your poke career
and then you have the master classes in
which you can really specialize in a
specific spot like i said this is more
for the advanced players
we will continue to release these
monster classes throughout the year
and even after until we've covered all
the spots
i'm already working on some updates for
the mechanics of poker as well
the ideas that in my head would make the
program huge but at some point you know
you have to say okay this is what we're
going to release
but i still see some room for
improvement there as
i will probably always do so for the
next year i'll probably keep on
releasing updates in there as well we
have a very nice active discord
community we do a lot of live q and a's
in which i can further shape my
philosophy and
make the program even better now these
vlogs will also become a returning thing
here on youtube
i have a couple of more in the making
and after they've released we will kind
of see where this is going
and as for my opo career i try to keep
on making improvements
and work smarter combine things a little
bit better
i still see some room for improvement
i've gained a lot of the information
and i will continue to gather a lot of
information look for inconsistencies in
my game and in my decision making
process
and finding ways to resolve those
usually what we do is we
try to find ways around the problem this
is not really fixing the root cause you
have to kind of dig in
what is the root cause that leads me to
be inconsistent in this area
try to find that root cause and resolve
it then the next step in our poke career
is to add 5k
which i will probably do after the
summer and after the academy has
launched
as then the tasks in pokemon will
probably become a little bit more
routine so i can better schedule my time
which will make me perform more
consistently and better at the tables
also in my own poker career i've made
more progress than again
and then i think i'm definitely ready
for the 5k tables
and from there we will kind of see where
things are going i think it's very
important that what you set these kind
of goals like i want to play 5k i want
to play 10k
that you don't restrict yourself to a
certain time
that you have to make it for example i
will go and play 5k
or 10k when it's time or when i feel
like i'm ready to play 5k or 10k
as soon as i start to rush or put time
pressure on
i have to play 5k or 10k within 3 months
a lot of stress can start to occur for
that i need to perform well
i need to also be winning and then
results or how i'm performing
in my current session are suddenly
becoming way more important as there's
now
a time limit to it which will lead me to
way more tilted
which will lead me to be way less likely
to actually reach 5k 10k earlier than if
i would set
the goal that i have to reach it within
3 months so
are you putting too much pressure on
yourself that's what i'm asking you to
reflect on because with this time
pressure it's way more likely that you
will
have a lot of negativity which you know
if we can believe the law of attraction
joe dispenza game
is not very gto okay we're sending out
wrong messages to the universe guys
and then there's twitch which i'll
continue growing just as the poker
ambition brand
if you've never been at a weco show on
twitch which i find it
quite hard to believe but if so make
sure to follow us on instagram
join our discord or look at our twitch
channel in the calendar to see what i'm
streaming
and join me in one of our next streams
speaking about streaming i'm actually
about to start a stream right now
and i will show you guys a little bit
what goes on behind the scenes of
a twitch stream
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
maybe we should have actually added
maybe a little bit smaller on the turn i
think my bed was a little bit too big
if we're gonna be picky and guys if you
want to become the best
you know you have to be picky it's fine
that you made the mistake but try to
strive to do better next time
let's try a little funky three right
here with the king king 10 off
low frequency low frequency we decided
to do
something funky which i'm now actually
catching myself saying
very often usually the funky factor is a
little bit a little bit higher on stream
than austria
we're gonna check race with the jacks
it's a spot that you should definitely
be careful stepping too much as i will
have
the majority of nuts and future nuts
so usually from that point of view
he shouldn't put too much money in the
pot and i should put a lot of money in
the butt
that's kind of how poker works
pocket dates we're gonna play it uh
playing the flat call because people
don't know how the flat goal works
oh i've gavin explain it to you
the next tip i want to tell you about is
what i consider to be my strongest
weapon
in no limit taxes holder it's called the
flat call
he bets spots and i think we've been in
similar situations i think
if we have like fours five for suited
six seven suited we're gonna get it in
seventh is a little bit close
but i do think it's the best play
so yeah hope jam and hope
i think it's just time to ship it in and
go to bed so i actually wanted to take a
quick look at
the hand that we just played on stream
we opened
pocket seventh and we got through it by
the big blind
we call pocket sevens and we face a very
big
bat now this is actually quite a common
strategy for the other position
in general using big bats when you're
the three brother out of position is a
very big part
of how that strategy generates high ev
something that i explained in the master
class and now it's up to us how are we
going to proceed with our range i think
there's some interesting concepts here
so let's look it up
now if you like what i'm about to show
you click
the link in the description below to get
off on your gto wizard and this way you
can really help out the channel
to look it up i'm gonna be using gto
wizard which is basically a web
browsing solver which we have decided to
partner up with i'm really excited for
the software they have a couple of
really good functions
so we opened from the cutoff
the button folded small blend folded as
you can see
in this description as well you can see
all the prefab ranges for free so no
more paying [ __ ] tons of money for
pre-flop ranges
the big line three bats and we see that
sevens
is a pure defend as kind of expected
usually when the pocket pairs get
a little bit lower they start to defend
at a higher frequency
deuces usually defends at the highest
frequency that's also because it doesn't
open at a very high frequency
so we call kind of as expected believe
the flop was
three six five rainbow
and we can actually indeed see that if
we look at big sizings
in the gto wizard apparently there's
over bat a half pot or small sizing and
we can see that bigger sizings in
general are going to be most dominant so
betting small is definitely not highest
ev
so we don't have a pot here but let's
look at the thing that is closest to pot
which is gonna be the 27
and i expect to see
this eights is going to be a fault
ninth is often going to be a fault and
then sevens is going to be a call or a
jam
this is because seven still has a gutter
and we're kind of beating the same type
of hands
maybe if we have nines he sometimes also
gems nines
but i think he never has eights so
basically sevens
is eight only then with extra equity so
in these kind of situations you usually
want to play a hand for backup equity
you can also actually see that tens for
example is pure jamming so
the cutoff point is i would say tense i
think if you're just folding nines in
game you'll be fine
but as you can see sevens here a pure
gem now always when we look into the
solver it's important to kind of look
if your opponent reaches these kind of
frequencies
in general i would say on these boards
the the intuitive bluffs like
jack 10 suited knight and suited are
quite easy to find here here we can
actually see that sometimes even
uh potting pocket aids but it doesn't
always tree bat it doesn't always pot so
i don't think it's a
something that we have to take in
consideration all that often like even
if it's betting eights
we're folding nine so from his strategy
basically what he's doing is when he
bets eight while
sevens is stacking eight and nines are
folding um
so it's kind of a mergy type of play
some advanced [ __ ]
in this solve another option that i'm
actually a very big fan
of is the analyze your hands function
this is where you can export your hands
from your database
upload it to gta wizard and it will
analyze and give you feedback on all the
hands you played so now we're going to
find out guys
how gto is the weka really
so this is the analyze page in which you
can upload your hand so what i've done
is i went to upload
and i clicked false and i decided to
upload a folder where i
exported my session and here we can see
that gto wizard has
now analyzed my session and we can see
that i made 94.5
correct place 95.5
wrong place and an average ev loss of
0.03
which actually isn't that bad then if
you want to
look at bigger blunders so let's say for
example go to this one
and we'll go to the hands and here i
will actually filter on ev
loss i want to see my bigger ev loss
hands that i've played okay so i'll
filter her on iv loss let's go to my
biggest blunder
it's a 5.7 bb blunder
and here on the right we'll see the hand
apparently i raised the button
oh i three better from the small blind
went check check check check
check check so i checked down king jack
i actually remember
this hand i decided not to bluff because
i was a little bit
off a chicken so the chicken song for
the weko
you can clearly see that the solver
prefers to play this hand
in uh in a bet
because you can see that is definitely
the line that has highest ep on the
river
and it actually wants to bat 18 so
it wants to bet like three quarters of
the pot probably actually also on the
turn
on the turn actually it also wants to
bet so i played the hand wrong on
multiple streets
so as we saw i did jam and venom folded
and we picked up the pot
and i think the play is good due to
default equity and due to the equity
when called
so let's see if you can get a higher
score than the weko
go in the description down below and get
10 off on gto wizard
subscription so just finished an
excellent stream
