Ado let's get into today's episode with
Matt Berkey
all right here he is Mr Berkey thank you
for coming on the pot thanks for having
me uh I wanted to start off this
conversation free poker you studied and
got a degree in computer science however
the the scores you got in that degree
were not worth much as you spent all of
your time pursuing a professional
baseball career now being competitive in
sports or games
um before poker has become a common
trend on this podcast many of the guys
we spoke to had a history in either
sports or often computer games is a very
common one as well I don't know if you
if you have any experience in that as
well but I'm very curious to hear about
when and where that competitive Drive
originated from to pursue baseball as
like a professional career instead of
something you know you just do with your
buddies in your spare time
yeah I think that uh just the era that I
grew up in uh coming from a very small
Steel Mill Town
it wasn't the the scientists and the
doctors and the lawyers that were really
like put on a pedestal it was the
athletes the musicians you know the the
people who were uh big names in pop
culture
um I think that represented a path out
kind of uh you know we were very small
Podunk town that had one steel mill and
that was the only reason people lived
there so I think I naturally gravitated
towards Sports
um and again it was a kind of a
byproduct of my peer group too when you
grow up with the same 25 kids from the
time that you're five until you go to
college uh it's it's just kind of
natural that Sports is the common
language that you all speak so when it
comes to like academic Endeavors uh even
brains sports like chess
that was like too too Niche right it was
too outside the populace uh to really
take any risks on and that uh
accompanied by the fact that uh I kind
of grew up in
a way where the the first six or seven
years that I was going to school I
wasn't very popular I didn't have a lot
of friends and I realized that uh
Athletics and staying active was just a
way to become uh kind of a part of a
group
so it was like the the
draw towards a community that Drew
towards baseball I guess also a sense of
status right or at least from like all
if I see like high school movies for
example in America it's always you know
yeah like the jokes the guys who play
sports those are those are the guys
right not necessarily the the quote
quote nerds
yeah and you know it was one of those
things where it's uh my dad was very
intelligent uh in spite of like all of
his shortcomings
um you know he was initially a chemical
uh engineer and then went on later to be
a computer scientist uh but
he was like everything I didn't want to
be right like he he was a nerd who on
top of that had like anger issues and
like had all these shortcomings that I
didn't really idolize what I idolized
was uh the Steelers who showed up every
Sunday the The Pirates Who were there
day in and day out the Barry Bonds of
the world uh so I wanted to be something
bigger like when you're a kid you only
recognize uh what's kind of being
projected as important to you as being
important and it wasn't it wasn't
politicians or scientists or or people
really changing the world that was kind
of thrust upon me is like these are the
important people that you should look up
to it was athletes and uh on top of that
uh I think that
um I just aspired to to more than
like I didn't know what I wanted to do
when it came to using my brain but it
was abundantly clear that I had a love
for sports specifically baseball uh it
was something that I'd done since I was
a toddler and I kind of took naturally
to it so it was very easy for me to just
be all in from like the age of seven on
I I don't really know much about
baseball but I know most sports go quite
deep if there's a strategically as well
obviously poker is very strategic game
wasn't the Strategic aspect that
attracted you to baseball as well or was
it purely the athleticism I I don't
think so at a young age
um and it's ironic because of all the
sports baseball is probably the most
data driven
um
but I I think that there was definitely
a turning point between like little
league and high school ball where it
just stops being something that you're
doing for fun and you stop viewing it
through the lens of a child like uh
vantage point where you kind of just
show up and do what you're supposed to
do and like hope for good results right
like by the time you're a teenager and
you're playing competitively you stop
hoping for good results and you start
analyzing you start wondering like what
when should I be looking for a curveball
versus a fastball and like how can I
increase my batting average uh by
you know picking up on pitches that uh
or patterns that my opposition may fall
into so I think like by the time I was a
teen I started to delve into the
strategy side of things and certainly by
the time I was in college uh I I way
outperformed my talent when it came to
being a leader when it came to being a
captain uh all of these things it was
all byproduct of my work ethic which was
largely born out of the fact that I was
just a cerebral player so I wasn't the
most athletic I wasn't the most talented
by any stretch but I knew exactly what
to do in every single moment because I
was studying the game so deeply
all right that makes sense did you
notice any
any change in how you experience or
maybe to join the game when you went
from like a kid playing baseball to like
more of a teenager like you said you had
a more
Improvement driven mindset did that
change your experience towards the game
in any sort of way
uh yeah I think initially
um and specifically in other sports that
I wasn't taking it seriously so I played
Club volleyball through college as well
and then I would play like pick up
football and I was in a roller hockey
league as well and once I started taking
baseball seriously I noticed that I
couldn't really approach any other Sport
with this just show up and see what
happens kind of mentality so I kind of
lost the love for some of the other ones
because I knew my cap right it just
became so apparent uh what my
limitations were and how abundantly
capped that would be especially if I was
dedicating all my time to this other
Arena which made me a lot less
interested and that that kind of takes
the Romanticism out of it which you know
when you're young especially as a teen
everything's about or at least for me
anyway like everything was about the
Romantic ending the the Hollywood script
where you know you get to be the hero or
you get the girl or whatever the case
may be and I always in my mind like
fascinated those story arcs where uh I'm
the main character and whenever you
start to lose love a little bit for
these other Arenas that used to be so
much fun
um it's kind of a sobering moment you
you kind of become an adult very quickly
yeah when rationality kicks in and you
see how success Works in for example
baseball like ah I'm a person who likes
things when he's good at things oh I
don't have the time to put in for these
other sports I can imagine that then the
joy for the other sports kind of uh
disappear a little bit is that actually
something that you still have up until
today like you only have a certain
amount of time for a certain sport or
you do you now see it purely as Leisure
oh it's so much worse now I mean it the
the compounding interest of it all is is
so terrible because
especially like having spent 20 years in
poker now right it's like I've dedicated
effectively half of my life to a game to
ex that I'm trying to excel at it's
really hard to go be mediocre at
anything else right because you know
that you're cutting out study time to do
that or you're cutting out actual uh
time at the felt to do that so I
recently picked up pickleball which I
absolutely love and it's one of those
games where
um of course like having certain
physical attributes will will rise you
to the top faster and
um you know being predisposed to certain
Talent will allow you to get to the top
but it's largely uncapped it's it's a
brand new sport and if you meet like
some average requirements your ceiling
is pretty much unlimited and I
immediately fell in love with that but
as I've spent like a year and a half
kind of growing up with the same group
and seeing how much faster they're
accelerating through because they can
dedicate more time or they're just more
naturally predisposed to Talent uh I I
get so frustrated where it's just like I
even going out to play for fun now is
like a waste of time I should just be
doing something better with my life
yeah that that definitely sounds
familiar I I I I do think I've managed
to give it a place that I say okay this
is you know there's other things for
example when I go out and play football
there's also a certain social respect
like oh you know it's a five aside we
have a little chat you know I'm doing
some exercise I'm outside I I try to
view it now from those positives
obviously sometimes there's a disconnect
between what my brain thinks and what my
feet actually do right yeah that can be
quite frustrating I think I kind of
learned to give it a place
yeah I wish I could uh I stopped playing
video games in college for this exact
reason right because when it came to
should I spend a couple hours playing
video games or should I spend a couple
hours playing online poker well they're
both video games in my mind and one of
them's paying me money
uh and I hate to break things down to
that level because I just don't care
that much about bottom line or or
maximizing my time that way but it's
really hard to justify
uh you know setting aside 30 hours to
beat a video game when you could
otherwise be earning maybe 200 bucks an
hour
yeah that I also I played a lot of video
games and when I started to play online
poker I kind of scrapped those out
completely also because like I'm really
in my free time gonna still sit behind
my computer and play and play video
games but indeed also what you said it's
no longer I think also it's no longer in
line with your objectives right
especially when you're trying to become
a very good poker player uh you know
it's like okay your values kind of
change you don't anymore play that
purely for fun and you find other things
that give you enjoyment you already get
like the the self-development part out
of Poker that you maybe used to get out
of gaming getting good at something you
have this strategic aspect and then to
relax and have fun I guess you choose
other activities that are not behind the
computer
yeah I think I think you really hit the
nail on the head with the
self-development part
um maybe something that we don't really
recognize too often without a lot of
hindsight and uh introspection is that
uh the majority of the things that we
found to be
rewarding or uh entertaining or
substantial to us in our youth we're
largely just things that we're shaping
our path moving forward like we're we're
just trying to carve out our interests
we have no idea who we are what we are
what we want to pursue what our purpose
is right but once you start to solidify
that a little bit and you start to have
slightly a better understanding of what
path you're on and what direction you're
headed you have to kind of trim the fat
and a lot of that stuff Falls by the
wayside and you reminisce for it or
you're nostalgic for it but it doesn't
serve you anymore right like you kind of
nail it you'll find other Arenas to
fulfill either your competitive side or
uh just sheer mindlessness or
entertainment whatever the case may be
but it doesn't have that same impact any
longer because you're not this blank
ball of clay you're actually quite
molded and you have kind of a purpose
and Direction so you know now all of a
sudden when you're feeling those those
voidless hours where you're shutting
your brain off just watching a movie it
feels so empty because it's exactly what
it is right it's literally just
mindlessness whereas before you were you
were playing a video game and who knows
maybe you'll develop video games 20
years from now right like at 19 you have
no idea
I definitely also actually think that
playing video games obviously it depends
which games uh definitely I I would say
it has some benefits uh growing up
because you know you teach certain
skills you you you I don't know exactly
which skills but I'm sure Studies have
been done that if you play certain games
a lot when you're young it probably has
some benefits to to your future
capabilities I assume yeah for sure for
sure like dexterity strategy all those
things uh you're certainly tapping into
necessary developmental things
um whether or not they're most efficient
that's a different debate I guess yeah
and I guess at some point also how much
time you spend in it and that's that's
you know time time taken from something
else so I don't know if that really
balances each other out
um I was listening to your only Friends
Podcast over at soul for y
um and there was an interesting
discussion about a tweet bency B put it
out that you thought was heavily
influenced by a survivorship bias in
there you mentioned how you gave
everything for your baseball career and
as we off or all now know you didn't
turn a professional baseball player but
you turned professional poker player
um you said that you are just never
going to make it didn't really matter
what you did as you were capped to a
certain level because you did not
possess the natural Talent needed to
make it to the top one percent
now listening to this some questions
came to my mind first one being when did
you realize that this was actually the
case in baseball
how did you feel about it and how did
you handle it
that's a really good question I I think
that the answer is kind of two parts uh
subconsciously I probably knew
for a very long time
um I think maybe I even like surprised
myself along the way uh uh you know to
kind of give you my my timeline
I didn't start at a small high school as
a freshman which would be expected of
anybody who has the chance to make it
professionally but it's easy to just
rationalize with yourself and say I'm a
late bloomer uh I could show them I just
need to work harder then I went to
college and after my freshman year I was
cut from the team
uh and it was a division three team
which is the lowest division that you
can play so I was forced to make a hard
decision of am I going to continue to
pursue this or am I going to quit and
just accept that you know this coach's
read on me is correct and I'm not good
enough I chose the former I transferred
actually up to a division two school and
I've never worked as hard as I worked
those four years I I just absolutely
busted my ass I'm quite confident that I
grinded harder and put in more work than
probably a lot of people who actually
made it to the professional ranks uh and
I could think I could say that pretty
confidently because I know given the
success that I have in poker I haven't
worked even one-fifth as hard as I
worked at baseball and that's kind of
why I think that there is this predis
disposition to Talent right the guys who
actually make it to the MLB
a lot of them would make it almost
regardless uh so long as they don't do
anything to shoot themselves in the foot
right they just have that level of
talent and as long as they
as long as they cultivate it in any
capacity with any level of work and
intelligence they're very probable to
make it they're just the select few
they're the one percent of the one
percent right they're destined to make
it and the ones that don't usually have
some like tragic story aligned to it
right they either fell out of love with
the game where they had some tragedy
along the way got injured whatever
um and I view the same in poker it's
like I worked hard in poker don't get me
wrong like you know when Ben talks about
not spending your 20s in the club and
you know putting in all the hours and
things like that that was me to a
certain degree I was putting in 2000
hours a year now granted I didn't really
come up the era I came up was very
different right you didn't just spend
all your time online combing through
data really honing in right it was it
was very much a feeling process because
there was no guides we were carving the
path
um and you just Chase DV whether that
was a soft online game do you happen to
stumble into on a random eurocyte that
had a a sports book attached to it or it
was the casino down the road was running
a big MTT like you you literally just
played it all anything that seemed like
it was going to be a plus opportunity
plus CB opportunity you just fired so I
spent a lot of time in my poker path
just chasing and
uh you know much like life just just
trying to discover and figure things out
which doesn't really allow you to work
hard and it certainly doesn't allow you
to work smart right most of the work
that you're putting in is just filtering
out the noise and figuring out what the
hell is worth anything now of course
that doesn't resonate with anybody who's
new to the game now because everything's
so streamlined right you play a hundred
thousand hands you you catalog that
database you now upload it to pt4 or
Wizard or something like that and you
come through you see the mistakes that
you're making you sort for them you
train them you get better you calibrate
you go execute again on another hundred
thousand hands right we didn't have that
luxury we were literally flying by the
seat of our pants operating in the
absolute dark and
um
I think
having done all of that and then moved
into this new era where you can actually
have a strategy study deeply calibrate
your game and things of that nature I
recognize how much work it takes to get
there but I also recognize that like
by doing it blindly I got fast tracked
in a way that nobody who starts now
could ever understand right like I was
able to develop skills that
um kind of get hindered when you're fed
the answers and and kind of LED along uh
the path on its own I'm only saying all
of this to to kind of paint the picture
that we like to glorify working hard and
we like to believe that life and poker
are both meritocracies where the more
effort you put in the bigger the results
are that you get out but that's just
simply not true both are variance driven
uh Arenas right and oftentimes people
are just selected and maybe they're
pre-selected or predisposed by some sort
of talent right in poker it's going to
be intellect it's going to be problem
solving it's going to be rationality
um these are going to be heavily favored
for people who make it right and in
baseball it's going to be physical
talents it's going to be speed it's
going to be uh hand-eye coordination all
of these things if you lack in any of
those Arenas sure hard work can catch
you up but it's almost impossible for it
to surpass people who has all of those
things and are putting in any effort at
all
yeah that makes sense and I think the
conclusion of the discussion that you
guys had were that obviously you need to
put in the work but
you know if you put in a lot of work
is and that's necessary in order to
reach like your full potential but the
full potential that someone has the
captain someone has is driven by Talent
or a certain predisposition correct
yeah I think that that's largely what I
want to get at but also uh you know I
kind of wanted to start from a a common
ground where I wanted to acknowledge
that Ben's correct we all agree that you
have to work hard for success I don't
think anybody's trying to to
um you know reduce that down to oh
whatever man if you just show up like
good things will happen like nobody
believes that to be true what I was
trying to point uh uh uh put a little
bit more emphasis on is that it's easy
for Ben to say this on the back end of a
10 or 15-year career where he's had
success right he overlooks all of the
advantages that he was afforded along
the way that had nothing to do with his
work ethic right it's easy to be a part
of the German conglomerate that came up
during the uh the initial boom of high
rollers where they had something figured
out before everybody else and now you
have Capital available to you you have
some of the sharpest Minds available to
you you have some of the best top
software available to you it's like of
course you [ __ ] worked hard you had
literally everything at your fingertips
right not everybody is that fortunate so
when I say it's survivorship bias I'm
talking about all those intangibles that
we so easily gloss over because we put
in thousands of hours of effort into
something right well it's like you would
have never put in that effort if you
weren't afforded all these advantages to
begin with like even just me being a
middle class white guy in America like
that just already sets me a head to put
in more effort into things that have a
high ceiling right whereas if you're you
know a a lower class Ethiopian it's
going to be really difficult to just
like go out and pursue an engineering
degree even if that's your talent you
know
yeah that makes actually a little that
makes a lot of sense actually an
interesting part on that I think it was
the figure but that we did that they
said the drive for people to play poker
he said that a lot of people from I
think it was them from from Brazil
prefer driven financially because like
you said there that basically their need
for certainty and security is a little
bit higher because where they came from
right it's harder for them so they want
to capitalize on this opportunity where
he said like for example Northern
Europeans they play a bit more from like
oh I want to be the best and they care a
bit less about the the financial side of
it just because you know I in my opinion
for example I'm born in the Netherlands
if you [ __ ] up in the Netherlands you're
[ __ ] up pretty bad path you have so
many safety nets you're sorry there's
safety nets man if you don't have money
the government will give you a house the
government will give you this the
government will give you that believe me
you have to do something really really
really wrong in order to screw up in the
Netherlands but you guys are happy right
yes I I guess so I guess so that's every
study I read you guys are the happiest
nation in the world
yeah yeah yeah well yeah I guess so I I
guess so I mean there's obviously you
know for example I've lived four years
in Brazil as well and these people
actually look happier to me on average
than Dutch people or maybe you know they
express it more I guess it really I
think they're a much more emotional
culture right yeah they're more in
emotional culture and so I guess if you
with my eyes it looks like they are
happier because they're more expressive
of their happiness than for example a
Dutch person a Dutch person I guess is
more content and that's I guess shows
less emotion than being happy or being
angry because Brazilians they just
[ __ ] away a bit more you know they
they are very angry or very happy
whereas deaf people are way more content
so if being content is the definition of
the happiness in that in that study then
yeah I guess that's probably yeah that's
probably a little bit of like the
measurement right the fact that uh you
guys have the luxury to not really ride
the highs and lows because with
projecting uh gratefulness and happiness
there's also suffering behind that right
that's that's when you're kind of
ping-ponging off both ends
um but you know there's just a lot of
advantages to to your region too I'm not
super sharp on this stuff but I do
recall like reading this study recently
um and a lot of it just is born out of
like uh homogeny and nationalism like
it's it's very easy to get a small
nation to kind of rally around uh let's
all work for the greater good of each
other right
um I don't think we've gotten to that
point worldwide yet not even close
no yeah I I agree I wanted to I wanted
to touch on one one small point that you
said I think you were placed out of the
team in a division three
uh uh League yeah why did you choose not
to accept that fate so your coaches like
Berkey you're not even good enough to
play division three some people would
then say okay well coach thanks for
porting me out I'll I'll look at other
things but you choose to like give him
the finger and say oh oh yeah you know
it motivated you that that shows a
certain character trait where does that
come from character trait's a good way
of I would have went with character flaw
but uh all right okay so it has probably
has its good sides and his downsides
right yeah I I am notoriously stubborn
uh I'm incredibly
um self-motivated and uh I certainly
have a very prideful streak throughout
me
um
I mean I think it was a combination of
things right like I I cried so hard when
I found out I got cut because one it was
it was actually shocking to me I I truly
didn't see it coming I thought I was
like performing pretty well uh and two
uh you know we I that whole story got
brought up because I said subconsciously
I probably always knew that I was pretty
limited
um I wasn't ready for that slap in the
face right I wasn't ready for that to
become the conscious and uh I just
always operated off the mindset I I come
from poverty I come from a small town I
come from kind of nothing and I think it
just instilled this like free world
mentality into me like at my core where
in spite of all those things that were a
bit of hurdles uh throughout my life uh
I was always heavily encouraged by those
around me uh whether they were blowing
smoke up my ass or not it didn't matter
because it it gave me an over inflated
sense of self around certain things uh
like I truly believed I was intelligent
whether I was or wasn't I truly believed
um I was going to be able to be a high
achiever whatever I put my mind to and
like as an adult now I kind of realize
that's that's [ __ ] even if you're a
genius who has all the skills in the
world right like we don't have that
level of control really
um but as a kid it lit a fire under me
and honestly as a young person it's a
far better mindset to have than a
nihilistic one where nothing matters and
uh you know you're kind of just
subjected to your own reaction reality
because if I had that if I had that like
uh nihilistic point of view I would have
just yeah you're right I would just
shift it off of it I just said okay
uh that's the end to that I'm gonna get
my education now and I'm probably gonna
become a computer programmer and you
know maybe hate the next 20 years of my
life
you mentioned like that unconsciously
you knew but I guess at that point you
were not ready to accept it which I
guess is also you strive so much towards
being you know you already said like
sports that was all there is so I guess
your identity was so tied to being that
sport person that you were not ready to
that basically have your identity be
taken away from you right yeah what what
was different the second time around
because at some point like I said you
did came to the point in your
professional career where you realize
you were kept maybe you already knew it
right you already knew it baby direct
them but now you were ready to accept
that fact well how is that what what
changed honestly I think it was just
better opportunity because even now here
you say that like I realize my identity
is still so tied there like I still set
myself up as the athlete within the
poker space kind of
um you know I just made a bet with
Landon that I can dunk a basketball in
six months I'm 40. I haven't dunked a
basketball in 12 years I'm only six foot
tall like the fact I ever dunked a
basketball is a borderline miracle in
and of itself so it's like for me to
actually have an outline out loud
conversation with myself that says
you've done it before you could do it
again like it's just Mind Over Matter
kind of it's such a lie like it is I I'm
maybe and this is a generous maybe I'm
maybe 10 to 15 to do this
and it won't be due to a lack of effort
like I will give my all but you know you
just have to accept certain realities
I'm very
bad at accepting the common realities of
we get older we're going to die we're
going to age out of things right like
this is just very hard for my brain to
conceptually understand
um and honestly if I didn't have poker
to transition to I don't know what would
have happened because I still played
baseball until I was 31. I only quit
because of an injury I tore my ACL and
at that point I was just doing so well
in poker uh I didn't have the time to
kind of like necessarily like rehab
myself uh in order to get back into
baseball shape I was just more concerned
about getting back into sports shape
which I accomplished
um but I had a hard hard time letting go
I I was still trying out for uh
professional teams into like my mid to
late 20s I think I was like 27 when I
had my final tryout uh I just like truly
believed that I was right on the
precipice
and uh that that may have been true in
my head
because I probably was like somewhat
close as in like you know The Fringe 10
that would actually get a look but I was
I was miles miles
away from the guy who would actually get
the contract you know in hindsight
even in real time uh you know I always
knew that it was like a quote-unquote
pipe dream
right it was one of those things where I
was just trying to surprise myself
so was it then that only until you
reached a certain level of Poker success
that you could kind of let go of needing
to be successful in baseball because you
could now replace it by a certain level
of success in poker that you would feel
okay with yourself in a certain way yeah
I think it's uh I think I've just chased
imposter syndrome my entire life right
because uh at some point
at some point you recognize that you
actually were the Imposter whenever it
comes to like pursuing the sport
uh like I had to have a hard talk with
myself at some point where it was just
like look man you you just weren't ever
going to do this like you're older now
you're not 19 this isn't going to break
you to to accept this reality
um and you know you're doing just fine
in poker now so like this is your new
Pursuit but the trajectory of my poker
career was very similar it was very up
and down and yeah my my highs were much
higher and my ceiling was uh a lot more
sustainable but I went broke plenty
throughout the first 10 years of my
career uh at points where like it was
a shock right like uh eight years in I
have 300 000 for the first time and uh a
year and a half later I have zero so
it's like stuff like that's kind of
inexcusable and it's a bit of
self-sabotage type stuff
um but then even on the back end of my
career the last 10 years where I've
played nothing but high stakes and I've
had uh you know a role that a younger me
would never even be able to Fathom and
uh at least monetary success that most
would would uh qualify as having made it
I never feel that way right I still feel
like I'm that I'm on that Fringe 10 like
looking up at the elite where it's uh
I'm kind of trying to play myself into a
position to
kind of uh have a shot right but no part
of me actually believes that I'm Elite
uh and part of that is I don't believe
anybody's Elite when it comes to a game
like poker uh I just think it's so
impossible to master at least in our
lifetime
um but the other part of that is so much
of our eyes have been opened in the last
six years with the Advent of solvers uh
the application of Technology you know
the game is just so wildly different and
I feel like I've done a great job of
keeping up but it's been exactly that
right it's it's just keeping up I'm not
setting Trends any longer I'm not really
uh discovering new New Paths to the game
it's it's kind of there for me to learn
is it also because of that Improvement
mindset that you have that and like you
said that you now see you know with
solvers and how how complicated the game
actually is and how far from you know
GTO we actually are that you always
Focus you said nobody's Elite so do you
then always focus on the things that we
don't know yet that kind of keeps you a
bit grounded where people are like yeah
of course Elite I'm the best blah blah
they naturally focus a bit more on all
the skills they do have and less on the
skills that they do still lack
right yeah I did for a long time uh I
aspired so heavily to
kind of prove some things that I thought
were theoretically good uh that I may
have been doing like way before this
stuff was explored uh like it it warms
my heart so much to see the amount of
over betting that's taking place now
like it just makes me so happy because
this is stuff that like at least in the
live realm uh you know guys like me were
doing way back in the the mid-2010s
um but along the same lines I just
realized like also
there's a downside to all of that right
with every with every new line that gets
discovered and popularized uh the game
gets that much tougher like even
whenever you have [ __ ] regs that have no
idea why they're doing what they're
doing but they're mimicking proper
sizings it's it's a handful to deal with
right like there's there's almost
nothing more dangerous than somebody
who's capable of betting 300 pot and has
no [ __ ] idea why
right like figure that one out in real
time you know it's like you know that
the mentality evolves I don't even know
what I'm doing then how are you supposed
to know what I'm doing exactly exactly
and especially if you don't really know
them very well right like if they're 26
and they just come out with a 3X pot
sized bet you're just like [ __ ] man this
guy's really studied and then maybe
after like 10 hours with them you're
just like oh no okay he like saw that on
a video somewhere and just doing it I
get it now but that's a lot of error
that occurred over those 10 hours
because you gave him too much credit in
in too many spots you know you start
paying off lightly because you assume he
has the proper Bluffs and it's live so
him having it it doesn't really confirm
or deny anything you know you're just
like well he had it like I assume he's
still balanced in that spot too until
you just realize nobody's [ __ ]
balanced nobody has any idea what's
going on
um but but to answer your question as
far as like uh is that pursuit of of
um you know carving a path something I'm
passionate about I was was for a very
long time and I think now I'm to the
point where
uh I'm much more passionate about just
being the best in whatever Arena it is
that I'm tackling because I realize more
so now than ever nobody can be uh just
great across the aggregate everybody is
turning into a specialist it's almost
impossible not to right so you pick a
lane you you it's not even any more like
tournaments or cash No Limit or mixed
it's like really really drilled down
like do you want to be the best online
six Max
100 big blind player in the world okay
go pursue that right do you want to be
uh a live uncapped cash high stakes reg
okay go ahead and pursue that because
that's a totally different strategy do
you want to be a high roller MTT player
okay do you want to be an open field
average buying of 3K MTT player all of
these are vastly different skill sets
vastly different and you know it might
be a little controversial to say but
like we talk about this all the time
when
um these massive Fields pop up
and uh you know you have the uh like the
main event was a great one Chris Brewer
ran the the that that of
um trying to discover win rates in the
main event and basically said I'll let
you pick 50 players any 50 in the world
you could have them uh and if they if
they collectively cash for more than 200
Roi like I'll lose the bet whatever and
people are taking absolute Crushers
right like the adamos and uh I mean like
Corey uh saved the bet for a lot of
people uh which you know whatever maybe
it's anomaly maybe it wasn't but
um
you know when you start to cherry pick
out of the High Roller scene for the
main event you might not be picking the
guys with the highest Roi right like
yeah like I almost certainly would
rather take and this is no slight to the
High Roller scene and it's certainly no
slight to the guys I'm about to mention
but guys like Darren Elias and Joe
McKeon who have just proven time and
time again that their Niche is running
through soft large Fields like their Roi
just might be higher than a guy like
fade Wars right and I know that that's
controversial in nature but it's not
meant to be right it's no slight against
fate or Fedor is obviously Elite but you
train to your environment right like I'm
I'm always going to be weaker at 100 big
blinds than I am at 500 because I'm just
used to playing soft games uncapped
yeah and it's the decision-making
process that a high roller traditionally
goes through when he plays High rotors
that's probably a lot of it's going to
be maybe uh sub-optimal when you play in
for example a main event also I think in
the end making good reads
on on the players or on the pool and the
person with the most experience probably
has the best reach and therefore makes
the best place like if I go now play
Live cash which I never do uh I might be
the best studied player at the table but
my reach I probably need some time like
if I would then put a lot of time in a
live environment I think I will be one
of the best there because then my reads
are spot on but as long as my reads are
wrong I need a certain time to adjust to
to the live environment
yeah I think that's a really great way
of putting it
um and I think it's an important
conversation to have because what's fun
about these conversations is that uh
there's no model for it there's no right
or wrong and the what what creates uh
hostility or tension around these
conversations is that the best in the
world tend to try to want to fit it into
a model right we just know that the guys
on the High Roller scene are better
poker players than Phil Hellmuth they
know more about the game their more
studied period they're just making
higher EV decisions always always right
but you just cannot deny that he makes
up for that in some sort of way
um and I think what makes the most sense
to me when I try to
uh kind of run this through my brain as
to like or to like logic out how this
can make any sense is a few things are
happening one the collective groups that
are Elite are looking at the game as
infinite right they're taking the
infinite mindset and they're recognizing
that volume is King and over the course
of uh forever the decisions being made
are going to fall in their favor as
compared to helmu how many doesn't view
the game that way it's very finite right
it's Point by Point decision by decision
each decision being unique to him
forever and ever like he'll never have
another one like it again and he draws
upon that in his previous experience and
uh it allows him to guess more
accurately than some people are
operating theoretically uh and I kind of
got some perspective to this when I was
speaking to an online Crusher a couple
weeks ago at a wedding and we were
talking about live cash and he was like
do you still enjoy it like do you still
love the game I was like I I truly do
like it's it's so much fun to me to be
able to problem solve day to day like
for a living like that's literally what
we do is we try to we put ourselves in
these tough tough spots and then we try
to uh ration ration our way out of it
you know and he's like I don't
understand what do you mean by problem
solved don't you just have a memorized
strategy or like haven't you just like
basically uh come up with the the the
full scope of your strategy and outside
of it being a unique situation you're
just pretty much on autopilot and I go
no not at all like every single spot to
me uh I'm taking in the information that
the environment's offering me in order
to drill down on my decision so yes I'm
going with a rough
uh estimated strategy a a baseline
strategy if you will but I'm almost
never executing it because I'm playing
against Joe or I'm playing against Bob
and they do certain things their sizings
mean different things and I'm always
internalizing that skewing me in one
direction or the other so almost every
single decision I make is exploitative
in nature except for maybe you know some
Auto seabed spots or or whatever but you
know once money starts to go into the
pot
from that point on we're brain solving
right and we're just using we're using
Theory as guardrails so to speak but
we're also of the mind that it's okay to
Freestyle and take those guardrails off
and you know if it just makes sense to
come up with a 10x pot Jam in this spot
and we've never looked at it before I
don't care let's just do it
um and that was kind of like eye-opening
to both of us because he's just like I
don't understand that at all
I would say this is a clash between
a GTO approach and exploitative approach
by the GTO approach focuses more on
playing a solid strategy let's say you
know obviously we don't play GTO but at
least it's it's the mindset of I play my
Baseline strategy which is very solid as
long as you deviate from that I make
money I'm not really looking to win more
than I quote quote shoot because I think
my strategy is good I don't really want
to deviate from it where the exploitive
mindset is way more okay you know you
have some like you said some other
seabed spots which are based on for
example Theory but it's way more like
what does Joe do or what does Joe do
wrong that I can capitalize on so you're
consciously attacking whereas the GTO
mind the player is more playing a
defensive strategy which I think
if he would now go play Live the
defensive strategy would probably be
best because he doesn't have to reach on
Joe that you have correct and obviously
and obviously it's it's a double-sided
sword and I see this actually this is
actually I think a big mistake that a
lot of players make they think that they
are an exploited player while actually
you know they're making wrong exploits
and then you're kind of cutting yourself
what was the expression you cut yourself
in the fingers is that the expression so
cut off your nose to spite your face
let's keep it on that because it's like
you either make for example a 6bb uh
winning play or you make a minor six but
be losing play right whereas the GTO
frame player is gonna you know be at
least neutral or V it's not gonna make a
big blunder so it's a completely
different mindset towards the game and I
think the bigger you reach and and the
you know the more accurate you reach the
more exploitative play does well but
unfortunately a lot of players think
they are having good reads but they're
trying to mind treat their opponent and
they're often wrong and they're just
making bad plays yeah yeah I don't even
know if I I don't even like to give too
much credit to the term reads because
it's so inaccurate when you when you
really break it down right
um I I I like to think of it more as
being able to uh absorb as much signal
as possible right so I think I think
what we're talking about guys who have a
good live presence that are able to
really extract as much information from
the arena as is available what they're
actually really good at is separating
signal from noise
so they're very good at being able to
recognize when somebody's betting
patterns actually do a line to a
different range than their opponent is
representing versus when somebody just
has set betting patterns that are just
their set batting patterns right
um that's just like kind of one simple
example but
um yeah to me I there's just such an
interpersonal aspect of live poker where
humans just really struggle to deceive
to the to a point that they're
absolutely
um
they're they're absolutely bulletproof
right and I'm saying that as somebody
who takes a lot of pride in uh feeling
like I don't give a lot off but I'm also
not arrogant enough to know that I don't
right I'm constantly on the lookout for
where I could be potentially leaking
information where am I uh kind of
overstepping it like does this bet size
align too often to Value as far as like
the hands that I've played on tape
yeah that makes sense so you're not
necessarily talking about Lifestyles but
you're also talking about uh patterns in
general errors and range construction
that you make oh like I said oh I'm
gonna split my sizing here and as soon
as soon as a human splits its sizing one
of them is going to be unbalanced the
question is which one right yeah uh I
wanted to Circle back on one one
interesting point when you started to
pursue poker
um if you were ever afraid that you
would encounter a similar cap as you
encountered in baseball or did your
confidence and your self belief did not
get influenced by that experience to a
degree that you doubted yourself going
in
oh no I I've been riddled with
self-doubt from like day one I I didn't
even want to like really pursue this as
a career my uh good friend Brian who
co-hosts the podcast with me uh he was
like all in on it he had no interest in
anything else
um
and he really talked me into it uh we
had probably been playing together for
like two years my Junior and Senior year
of college while I was still pursuing
baseball in a degree uh he had dropped
out and we were kind of just like
rounding whenever I had down time and uh
he was always the consummate
professional like if if if if we're
referencing rounders he was always like
uh worm you know the the guy who was
just in there grinded it out on his
leather ass making sure that he was
always profitable like he was always a
winner in every game but didn't really
ever take on risk and I I was kind of
I guess more Mike mcdish slash worm I I
never did anything I never did anything
shady so I don't want to align myself
with Worm but I took a lot of risk and
uh I had a lot of trust in myself
whenever it came to you know 2002 2003
now you're talking live reads actually
are a thing like I mean the worst kind
of stuff like the hand over mouth and
people just really gave it away uh and I
had a knack for that and I could just
remember as I was graduating college him
and I having a discussion where I was
just like you know
I I'm already failing at this baseball
thing I want to give it one more go uh I
don't think I can pursue another game
and like just come up short like I grew
up poor I don't want to be poor forever
uh and you know I have a few thousand
dollars now which at the time was like
more money than I've ever seen I was
like I think I'm just gonna like cut my
my losses here take the 6 000 that I've
made and you know go pursue a
programming job or something like that
he's like you have a real talent for
this like I'm out here grinding and I'm
making money but I'm doing it the hard
way he's like you sit down and you can
just see through people and I bought
into that again it was like one of those
things where when you surround yourself
with people that believe in you whether
it's true or not the way that they hype
you up kind of starts to to to make its
way into your subconscious and I just
truly bought into that it was like yeah
you know what I do notice that I'm
pretty good at picking up on this type
of stuff
five six years in it's like okay this is
now my career I'm kind of doing it but
I'm also riding the wave of variance the
whole time so I'm constantly going broke
constantly asking myself like is this
something I'm actually talented at like
am I just bullshitting my I mean the
first five years I was definitely
bullshitting myself right I was just
lucky enough that it was a soft market
and as long as you had a pulse and half
a brain you're gonna make some amount of
money
um but like once Black Friday came
around and I'd gone broke off of 300 000
just post Black Friday it was a long
dark year of really questioning like do
you have what it takes like everybody
believes that you're the most talented
in the group but you have [ __ ]
nothing to show for it like did you just
sell yourself really well to all your
friends and make them believe you're
talented because you you seem like you
suck from a result standpoint like when
the results don't align with the
projections it's just like at some point
you have to have a tough conversation
um and I think that the timing was just
really good it was right before the
Advent of solvers but it was also like
right as rounded up was launching uh as
a or sorry run it once was launching as
a training site and I just remember
watching a sauce video on um toy games
and it kind of took me back to when I
was building algorithms as a computer
scientist I was just like you know what
there's an element to this game that I'm
ignoring I should really dig into
studying the math a little bit harder
trying to think a little bit more
logically about it and I ended up having
like the best year of my career in 2013
and shortly thereafter I was playing
high stakes so I didn't even have time
to think about whether or not I was a
fraud
interesting Adam you've been uh silenced
silently listening on the sideline uh
murky here mentioned that at some point
he saw the toy games and something click
with him like hey wait I can resonate
with it I'm good at this maybe poker is
you know something that I can actually
pursue and maybe I should actually take
this a bit more serious and go all in on
it did you have any similar experiences
in your public career
not like that but my initial career
started moving to Thailand with some
friends and it was a big experiment
could we make money and make it work so
the first three months were survival pay
the rents can we make any profit at this
game once that was ticked off when I
wait a second we can just about survive
it was then okay where can we go with
this game can we move upstairs what's
the limits I met some guys you know in
my first year we're playing like three
or four Bargains higher than me and we
met them for like a coffee dinner and I
remember to have a conversation with
them about their approach to Poker and I
was like these aren't doing too much
like these aren't this doesn't feel like
the ceiling's too high in this format so
I'm like me and my friends who were
having this conversation like light
bulbs in my head just going we can
definitely get to like two or three
levels higher and that was enough to
like kind of pursue it to just go right
let's go all in with it I was living in
Thailand's very cheap living cost then
went to Bali very cheap living costs and
the first goal was I cannot be
sustainable can I be in this game long
enough to not go Baroque and then just
looking ahead and going how far can I
take this Pursuit see I think there's
it's always like little little Snippets
that keep you going like
um Matt was saying like bits of belief
from people around you the guys I was
living with at the time they always
believed that they could get the next
level the level above the level above
and sometimes you get pulled along for
that right you don't know what's going
to take you it's kind of the kind of
Blind Faith of I'm gonna put the work in
I'm gonna try let's hope let's hope that
it's going to go under Direction and if
not like recalibrate or or over time you
start to uh to figure out if you can
make it so yeah also bumpy ride to begin
with until you figured out I know about
what you were saying uh 10 years into
your career and you're still figuring it
out really to figure out where you're
gonna go I really want to touch back on
the point you talked about where you
built Your Role to 350k by 60 10th year
roughly and then you lost it all and you
lost that role then had to rebuild it so
yeah I want to take it back to that
moment and how would that feel like
first of all what circumstances LED you
to lose your role and how did you pick
yourself up there you've been 10 years
in the game and you're almost like going
back to square one how did you handle
that
yeah uh not well not well at all
um it was it was a unfortunate set of
circumstances I mean it's like one of
those things where again
uh the timing was just so different like
we were we were so on our own and there
was just nobody there on one hand I'm
like so jealous of uh like your
generation and and those who will come
after you because of the amount of
guidance that you have uh even just you
mentioning like oh we got to have dinner
with people who are playing a little bit
higher than us and they kind of
demonstrated like you know we can get
there we never had that man like uh the
the group that was ahead of me was like
negranu linger and Ivy you know what I
mean like they weren't sharing [ __ ] they
were very much interested in just like
holding us down and ensuring that we
didn't nip at their heels
um but you know luckily it was a time
where it was very fruitful and there was
a lot of money to go around for
everybody uh I I got my first real role
I mean I had 50k probably 10 15 times
who knows uh and just kept playing the
biggest game in the room until I went
broke I just I I hated the idea of uh
trying to manage risk of Ruin I was very
aggressive when it came to like Kelly
criteria and things of that nature so uh
eventually you know you just end up
going to zero but uh I ran deep in the
main event in 2010 ended up coming out
of that year with like a little over
300K and for the next 18 months or so uh
I was playing as big as I possibly could
and doing relatively well I made another
WSOP Final Table the following year was
playing like 10 20 40 pretty regularly
um and you know holding my own I I went
on some big upswings like half a million
up swings uh I went on like quarter
million downswings whatever wouldn't
have been that big of a deal to be
honest I I wasn't properly rolled but I
mean as far as like the live realm goes
I I think I was fine but I just didn't
know what to do I was 30 and I had money
for the first time and I knew that poker
couldn't be it like I started to see the
writing on the wall that less and less
money was available and you know you
don't get the 10 million in poker you
certainly don't get to 100 million in
poker
um and a million seemed like it was
close so it's like I was already
planning for what would happen after I
became a millionaire it was like well I
need to scale so let me get a stable
as one does the first time that they
come into money and unfortunately like I
just backed my friends and believed that
I could teach them the things that made
me good in a time where uh the stuff
that made me good wasn't really
able to be transacted right it wasn't a
concrete strategy it wasn't necessarily
rooted in Game Theory it was a lot of
intangible stuff so I would show them
the way that I worked the way that I
thought about the game the way that I
viewed flop textures
um you know I would try to have them
like group like look at a flop and group
it with high card middle card and then
middle card low card and then think
about what hands their opponents could
have I mean this is all before like hand
classes even existed you know I was I
was already thinking conceptually that
way and it was a foreign language to
them so they each lost like 100k playing
510 and uh you know like 2K 3K the mtts
the next thing I know I'm on 100K
downswing myself
so uh I remember I had like
30 000 left
and I was just destined to run at the
zero I had no interest in playing 2-5
and trying to grind it back up uh I I
was just like still sweating my normal
stakes and I looked at the Bravo app one
day there was a 510 game uncapped at
Venetian it was always a soft game it
was Easter Sunday I was like I'm gonna
go I head down there with 20 of my
remaining 30k I sit with it all very
firsthand I sit is straddled to 20. I
look at Kings in the cut off I make it
like a hundred because that's what we
were doing back then and this kid to my
left who was a reg at the time uh and
had just also come into money
uh like covers me and he makes it like
700 just egregious sizes but we're 2 000
big blinds deep who gives a [ __ ]
it comes back to me and I just like go
massive I make it like 4 500. and he
just smashes for 20K and I'm like if
this is the way I die this is the way I
die and I call and I go twice and he
goes no it's like this kid six months
ago would have ran it 16 times if he
would have the opportunity to you know
but he had just come into some cash like
probably had six figure roll for the
first time in his life and he just
absolutely wanted to destroy me and I
think when you're at your lowest points
like that you're projecting that like
you're desperate and you need this win
and like please and for him it's just
like if I destroy you I now become the
king reg in this [ __ ] get filled game
that is worth hundreds of thousands to
me so he goes one time and I'm like okay
I was like do you have Aces and he just
goes nope I'm like oh thank God so I
turn over my Kings and the Flop just
comes Aces deuce and he rolls over Ace
King suited I'm just [ __ ] dead
so uh I'm broke now I have like 10 000
and you know rents do I take care of my
family back home like that's gonna last
me maybe a month month and a half uh I
take out a credit line because my credit
was really good I had like an 800 credit
score so I get like a 15K credit line
and I just kind of press pause on
everything
uh I mope I'm depressed for a couple
weeks I I don't know what to do like I
literally remember waking up to take a
nap like I'd get out of bed I'd walk to
my couch and I would like lay down and
take a nap uh it was it was I don't want
to say it was dark like I don't want to
I don't want to make this sound like it
was more than it was but like it was a
low point for me for sure
um
and you know it just kind of brought me
back to when I got cut from the baseball
team like that was a that was a low
point in my life uh you know a lot of
struggles that I went through growing up
with my mother and her addiction uh when
I got cut from the baseball team my
granddad who was like one of the most
meaningful people in my life was passing
away from cancer at the same time so
like I was able to draw upon times in my
youth where I shouldn't have been able
to have the maturity to power through
but I I kind of found it and I just
remember like how much I leaned into the
things that I could control uh so you
know after a couple weeks of eating like
[ __ ] and sleeping all day and feeling
pretty bad about myself uh I kind of
just leaned pretty heavily into
self-discipline and uh self-growth and
the first few weeks few months maybe it
was mostly just a regimented routine of
eat well work out and wait
and it was a lot of like
you don't realize how much you're doing
nothing until you have all the time in
the world and you have a monetary
ticking clock over your head right it's
like I have no way to make any money
whatsoever but I have enough money to
kind of press pause on life for like
three months maybe five with my credit
right and so you don't want to do
anything rash you don't want to just
like go start working at a gym for 12 an
hour and just like give up on everything
but at the same token you understand
that like every single day that you just
sit around and do literally nothing
you're one day closer to being homeless
you're one day closer to having to move
back in with family and things of that
nature um but what I did notice is as I
got positive momentum going with uh with
training more and eating well my mind
cleared up and the Doom and Gloom and
the sinking sensation of like being a
failure started to escape me a little
bit uh and you know I started to do a
lot of writing a lot of introspection a
lot of like asking tough questions that
had almost nothing to do with poker but
at the same time everything to do with
poker you know like why do you
constantly get yourself to the point of
high achievement and then fail like
being able to answer these these kind of
tough questions that
most people shouldn't even be in a
position to ask themselves right uh I
feel kind of fortunate that I chose a
career path that forced me forced my
hand on that
um
and the the real Tipping Point was uh
about four months into all this
two events happened uh one
Russell Thomas made the final table of
the main event so this was 2012. uh he
was a November Niner with Jesse Silvia
who's a good friend of his and Greg
Merson uh and uh Jeremy osments also
um and three of those four I was
incredibly familiar with Jesse Russell
or sorry Jesse uh Greggy and osmus were
10 20 ranks that I played hundreds if
not thousands of hours with over the
years prior and I knew their game in and
out uh well Russell had hired Jason uh
Somerville to coach him
and we were Loosely friends he knew I
had a lot of experience with those three
so he kind of brought me on the team I
got paid like 4K literally nothing
um but it was a it was such a
magnificent
experience as far as like validating
that I was competent at least uh and
then Russ got fourth which I felt like
you know I played it very very tiny
roll-in uh realities I probably played
no role but at the moment it was it was
positive momentum uh and then shortly
after that I was asked to give a um a
keynote speech at my high school on uh
choosing an alternative career path like
kind of going off the beaten path and I
decided that I wanted to frame it around
Maslow's hierarchy of needs so this
notion that uh you know most people kind
of get trapped in the quote-unquote rat
race of needing to fulfill Food Water
Shelter uh clothing things of that
nature and never really uh evolve out of
that uh whereas the rest of the
hierarchy is like seeking love from
another seeking love from oneself and
then ultimately altruism
um and I wanted to really put a heavy
emphasis on graduating outside of the
Rat Race So in researching that I really
started to dig deep into my failures and
uh my sabotages and things of that
nature and luckily I had a good friend
who was kind of there almost like a
mentor he's 20 years older than me or so
very successful in the sports card
industry and he's just kind of watching
from afar uh the first six to eight
months he was just kind of patting me on
the back saying like
you're gonna get him Killer you know
don't worry about it like everything's
gonna be fine and then the final two
months like as I was delivering the
speech and everything else and I'm
literally dead broke at this point he
was just kind of like you sound really
good and I'm like yeah man I don't know
what's gonna happen but like I'm in a
very different place than I was when all
this first happened he's like
I'm Gonna Give You 5K to coach me and I
was like that's insane you're one of my
closest friends like I'm not taking your
money he goes I'm not taking this for
free
and he sends me a 5k wire uh I never
formally coached him he would just call
me we would shoot the [ __ ] and I would
talk hand histories with him but he
sends me this 5K wire I go and play a
500 win event
and get third for like 20 000 or 25 000
like immediately so now all of a sudden
I just go from being broke to having 30k
it's like okay
uh that was like
uh maybe March of 2013.
I start grinding two five enough to pay
the bills enough to maintain the bank
roll come into the World Series and I
have like maybe 20 000 left of the 30k
uh at the time uh Marvin Rhett Meyer was
buying packages and so I put one
together I think it was like uh maybe 20
events 17 events something like that
um sorted to him it's small markup and
ended up getting to keep a third of
myself and the second event I played uh
was the 3k6 max I get third for like
200k so now all of a sudden I have like
eighty thousand dollars I was like Hey
like I know I sold you 66 but like would
you mind if I buy a little more he's
like no no fine so I buy some of my
package back two days later I get a
fifth in a 1500 No Limit event for like
another 90 000. so now I have like 100k
and I'm like hey there's a 5k6 Max I
know it's not on the package do you want
a piece he's like I think you're a dog
in that field I'm like okay fine no big
deal uh I play it I still bubble it so I
get Max punished because I bought I
played 100 of myself but fast forward to
the end of the series there was a 5k 8
Max and uh I didn't even ask if he
wanted a piece I just played it I took
all myself except I gave my friend Berto
who gave me the initial 5K stake or
whatever loan whatever you want to call
it I gave him five percent and I just go
wire to wire in this thing where I have
95 of myself uh I chip lead with five
left and uh Matt perrins actually ends
up like
get me out of the door where we play
like 120 big blind pot all in pre-i base
King versus Ace eight and he just flops
me dead on the 882 board
um but I pick up another 200k score so I
had like a half a million dollar summer
where I had almost half of it
uh and at that point like
you know the mind's a weird thing man
when when you get into this locked in
Phase where you truly believe in the
process
uh this is a whole another conversation
but like this idea of process where we
ended thinking it's it's truly powerful
in that regard because when you start to
get positive feedback from your past
process like this the goals along the
way don't even matter the Milestones are
irrelevant right you just get this
positive momentum swinging and the next
thing I know like four weeks later I'm
playing 300 600 1200 in Ivy's room
wow wow what a story listening to that I
was trying to think how was this not the
end when you lost your role like 10
years in I was like how do you come back
from this like notice almost like the
rising from the Ashes to our story so
for you like it's supposed to be like
such a like crazy transformation like on
reflection but in that moment where you
basically um lost your role you've got
nowhere to turn to everything around
poker seems to be going dark in not the
direction you wanted to uh and you said
you had an introspects I'm really
curious during this players you said
you're asking yourself some really big
questions why do I keep getting so close
to success and achievements and blowing
it up why are you only making this work
and in that period I want to reflect on
what you came up with but you seem to
come out of that theories in a much
better frame of mind your friends were
not a single now wait a second you seem
ready you seem like you've come out of
it so uh during this internal reflection
point was there any kind of Revelations
you had any sort of things you had a
couple of terms with in a conflicts of
yourself or anything that was helpful
that helped you move forward from there
yeah I mean I want to be clear like I
think that the the high side of either
myself or maybe just all of human
potential is is very much restricted to
moments in time right like we are our
worst self far more often than we're our
best self but that was a big thing that
came out of it is is recognizing uh how
easy it is to to fall into that negative
momentum and become your worst self
consistently like make that your new
default and uh I realized that like I
carried a lot of
um feeling of neglect from like
childhood uh you know feeling like I had
to grow up too fast and uh I gave up a
lot of my best years I carried a lot of
that forward and when negative things
would happen to me they would amplify in
my head right I would feel like they
were happening to me specifically not
just uh as a byproduct of a game that I
was playing or whatever like it felt
personal and I always took it that way I
was I was very much the type of person
to wear my heart on my sleeve and you
know as my role was depleting so was my
mood so was my uh appearance like if you
saw me you just knew I was I was nearing
a Breaking Point right
um I I think I understood I had a lot
more control over that sort of
um
I guess Outlook when it was all said and
done I wasn't gonna be able to control
the outcomes of course but I was at
least going to be able to put myself in
a better framework uh uh to handle any
or all of the outcomes uh and this is
something that a little bit later in my
career I worked pretty heavily with
Elliot Rohan and things of that nature
but even still like I'm 10 years removed
from that low Point uh that cycle
persists like I saw it happen again when
I went on the 5 million downswing and I
saw the the the rising from the ashes
and my me being able to bootstrap and
really hold my own to to come out of it
and the cycle was much shorter that time
which was great uh and even now like
we're heading into a financial crisis
um you know a lot of things are swinging
negatively I see the writing on the wall
like there's potential for this cycle to
to present itself again and I feel it
happening when I lose sometimes right
like it feels dire it feels like I'm
washed up especially in a time now where
it's like I don't have the luxury of
volume but the stakes that I try to play
or
um
you know the availability of games to me
the last four years I I probably average
two to three hundred hours of Poker a
year
and I'm trying to turn that into a
livelihood you know and I'm playing high
enough that like if things go well you
can but we all know how big of a sample
300 hours is you can certainly run
that or below EV hell you could run at
EV for 300 hours and still lose 20 30 50
buy-ins who knows you know uh so I still
do feel this notion that I'm living on
the edge
um but at least emotionally and mentally
I think I'm a lot more equipped to
handle it because of that specific time
frame in 2012.
super interesting so I think it goes in
line with like the cyclic nature of life
there's always like highs and laws we
never stay in one season for too long
and I think for you like the lesson
you've learned is that you can ride the
wave so to speak you can ride the laws
you've got this kind of internal
mechanism of realizing I can get my way
out of it I can find a way to make it
work so that gives you this kind of
still the fear and self-doubt about the
future but now I would say this internal
kind of almost like celebrity where
you're like I can get through it
whatever happens I'll find a way so I
think that's a really uh long-term
lesson because I'm always thinking when
we go through life the life tests us it
goes right here's a lesson if you learn
the lesson about bears you can go to the
next kind of chapter so it's like
playing a computer game and if you can't
get past the level you just keep feeling
the feeling until you level up the
character life's giving yourself these
little Snippets going learn this lesson
learn this lesson and sometimes like you
said you don't learn the lesson fully
but you learn better to cope with it so
the lesson that you learn is how better
to deal with these adversities you may
still put yourself in scenarios where
you're going big downward swings you
maybe go broke it and but now you're
like ah I can make that kind of that
rebuilding phase a lot smaller and I can
come back from that easier so I think
for you like based on your character and
the way you've talked today it sounds
like that's a important attributes so
during this time do you feel like
there's any other skills that you
learned that have set you up for today
do you feel like doing that adversity
you had to uh develop any key skills
that have allowed you to uh yeah push on
and on with your career
um I I think one key skill that came out
of it was uh kind of the ability to
learn how to publicly speak and that has
nothing to do with anything we're
talking about but uh it's been an
invaluable skill uh as far as not just
creating content like I don't even give
a [ __ ] about that but
um it's allowed me to
carry myself in a public realm that
isn't necessarily reflective of uh the
introverted Shire type of Personality
that that I truly am by default
um I would say the other thing that like
has probably served me really well is
uh kind of understanding
it's it's silly one of my favorite
movies is Goodwill Hunting and I think
one of the most powerful scenes is
whenever uh Robin Williams is hugging
Matt Damon just saying it's not your
fault over and over again I don't know
how much you guys can relate to this
especially kind of growing up in an age
where uh it's easy for you to just do a
line check and see truly if it was your
fault or not right uh the better part of
my career I think I absolutely wallowed
in every single failure even if they
weren't failures right I should rephrase
it as I wallowed in every single
negative feedback uh so every time poker
which is truly one of the least
objective games when it comes to
feedback loops every time I receive some
sort of negative feedback I was
absolutely decimated I blamed myself so
badly I wanted to have so much control
around those outcomes and I truly
reverse engineered every single spot to
a point a single decision that I could
have made differently in order to you
know basically change the entire
trajectory of a hand or a session or my
life is a whole and that was so [ __ ]
unhealthy uh and it's something that you
know at least
pre-solver era was almost a default
mechanism to playing the game of poker
seriously in any regard uh I do think
like current study has allowed us to
alleviate that for a lot of people but
people come with these biases they come
with these uh misconceptions and we're
just kind of wired for results you know
even if it's incorrect and even if we
are logical enough to recognize that
that's not the right way to see the
world we're predisposed to it because it
kept us alive for for eons you know
um so I don't know like what your guys's
experience is with that but it took a
very very long time for me to get over
that and it I I took a lot of
self-inflicted beatings because of it
um it's when your identity is so linked
to the outcome of what you're doing or
the pursuit that you're on that when you
have a failure in what you're doing you
become a failure right see like
subjectively that's not true you still
want to touch to me you saw in it that
it just it's really hard to separate
that seeing if your friends are telling
you oh don't get too attached it's no
big deal you feel it like really
listening that it's like you're to blame
I said a conversation with the poker
player yesterday I need to get a very
similar kind of issue going on where he
just blames himself everything's his
fault he runs about his fault
everything's just this massive
self-blame narrative and he's trying to
learn the skill of acceptance how do you
accept the uncontrollables how do you
accept variants how do you accept
mistakes how do you accept not being
good enough and all these things are
like uh it's a real challenge to come up
with as a poker player because so much
of your identity is wrapped up in almost
like fixing problems being good being
small being clever so now you've got to
drop all that and be like I don't know
maybe I suck I'm gonna accept that
things don't go my way I can't control
the outcomes but you want to control it
so you've got to get this like this
weird acceptance of things on your
control and I really like what you did
during this kind of reflecting period
where either consciously or
subconsciously you turned your life to
control the variables I do this myself
all the time and if things are going
well my girlfriend always notices I'm
doing the gym harder I'm tracking more
things I'm really like like holding on
the things that are very controllable in
my life and I pursue them and grow in
those areas so I've always had this
anchor or something to fall back on it
sounds like for you you were able to uh
find controllable variables it was being
disciplined it was doing good health
habits good gym routines and that
allowed you some solidity to like almost
like push on from so yeah at the moment
like do do similar things right now well
how do you currently deal when you get
stuck or you're on downswings what are
some of the things you do these days to
maybe get yourself unstuck
yeah I think it's a lot of the same
um unfortunately I I don't I probably
don't pay enough attention to the
self-growth aspect of it like at 40 I
feel like I've Had My Moments of clarity
I've had uh my self-reflection and my
self-actualization phase but that's such
[ __ ] right like we shed our skin so
often that uh I wish it was something
that I were a little bit more in tune to
and I think that I am just not actively
right it's like subconscious uh
attention like I'll have these bouts of
anxiety every once in a blue moon when
I'm just laying in bed and I know that's
my brain kind of saying like hey you
haven't paid attention to this in a very
long time like you know take stock of
the relationships around you take stock
of where you're investing your time uh
the people that you're short with versus
the people you show Grace to uh you know
make sure that you're still on track to
be a good person and uh that's easy to
kind of get lost in the shuffle of of
day-to-day I don't want to call it
survival but uh you know sir thrival if
you will like we're always trying to
pursue this this level of eliteness so
to speak
um a lot of my attention gets diverted
into the company now and uh I think
having the having this conversation
makes me aware of things that I already
knew but like don't necessarily want to
say out loud but I do think it's like
almost an unhealthy obsession with
wanting to get it to uh these certain
levels of of scale and
um success right it's it's a projection
of trying to find a higher ceiling than
what I was capable of achieving as a
player right and it's always that next
thing right it was baseball then jumped
into poker and now poker jumping into
being an entrepreneur and it's like
I I strive so much to be in that point
one percent and I don't even know why
because I already know having had
relative success in baseball and
relative success in uh poker that the
the goals mean nothing to me like
legitimately nothing it's the building
of the processes that I Relish in so
much it's I take so much joy in being
able to say like well this is what
worked for me
and this is the framework around uh how
I thought about the problem right that
to me is so fulfilling because it's
replicable and it uh it has a certain
level of Integrity I guess around the
framework right like you
you're you're not like being forced into
something that is some cookie cutter
[ __ ] that is a how-to methodology
right it actually has like some deeper
substance to it and it has a purpose and
a why behind it so like being able to
like pass that on in any capacity to me
is is so Noble but
um I do find myself having like an
unhealthy obsession with identifying to
that and and wanting to constantly
pursue it in some aspect like I don't
know what I would do if it was all taken
away kind of thing
um I'm still the same though you know at
the end of the day like
I'll do stupid things like 75 hard where
I'm doing two days I don't need to do
two days I'm 40. I don't need to dunk a
basketball I'm 40 like but I constantly
want to be proving to myself that uh I'm
at least staying where I was like I
don't want to acknowledge that I'm on
the back side of life yet and you know
hopefully I'm not but I at some point we
have to acknowledge we're not that far
off like I can't possibly be 60. still
telling myself like we're almost at the
halfway point we're not quite there yet
you know
um but truly in my head like my goal is
not to
not to split life down the middle like
that where you reach a certain age and
now it's all downhill from there it's
more so to just be like
at the absolute Peak through each phase
like I don't care if I die when I'm 70
as long as I'm a strapping 70 year old
you know I want to be able to run when
I'm 70 and if uh if they take me my
sleep God bless uh whatever I lived a
happy life but I just don't want to be
old and decrepit that's that's my fear I
think
yeah I think so much of what you said
there is a healthy thing like that
obsession with being better striving for
more not accepting the limitations of
age pushing your limits and not letting
yourself regress most of those
attributes are positive but then we're
going to balance it with the fact of oh
wait wait when we go so obsessive with
something what do we forget about that
we really value it's often relationships
it's Health it's looking after ourselves
the people around us and we get so
singular focused on that obsessive value
which is really interesting I feel the
same way sometimes I said a very
specific goal and I just go one track
towards that goal and I know as I've
said it it means nothing when I get
there I know the pursuit is everything
but I'm still obsessed with like that
journey of getting there I sometimes you
forget my own rule that it's all about
the journey and the process but then you
get to that point close to it and you
reflect and like you said it's the
lessons that you learned on that weird
that it was all about so I think it's
it's good to uh so many people see many
iterations of this process of chairs and
things and realizing it's the it's the
pursuit not the outcome but I think like
having that almost like that
self-awareness to realize where did I
push this too far where have I overstep
my bounds where have I been too obsessed
with this one metric or one our area at
a cost of other things I think that's
that's kind of the the balance of high
Achievers I think a lot of high
Achievers are very good in certain areas
and then other areas will be very bad so
to speak and if you want to find a way
to uh basically have the life you want
in in multiple areas multiple Avenues
and the things that you value most you
want to yeah find ways to uh put the
time into them so ready for yourself
anything that you feel like you've been
obsessed with how was your relationship
with pork Edge during your career do you
feel like you were pushed it too far
during certain years and you sacrificed
other areas
um I don't think so I
yeah I actually think I was very lucky
in that regard uh I've never been a
volume guy I can actually even remember
um
coming up I was very close friends with
uh
he was a very very very early heads up
sit and go Crusher uh his name was John
Ford he was I think he got fifth in the
PCA the year that Ike uh and that whole
crew natives like 2006 maybe
um he's a Pittsburgh guy and we were
pretty close and he was just strict
online like hated everything about live
poker and my whole crew was just all
about live and I can remember like we
went on trips and he would just stay in
the hotel and grind online the whole
time he was mostly playing like stars
hyper sit and goes or maybe it wasn't
even hyper back then uh but whatever
just like heads up Satan goes and he was
doing really really well and all he
would talk about is like volume volume
like you know if I play x amount of
tables over y amount of hours like this
is what I can expect to return and to me
like I was so romantic about the game I
was just like
how does that matter like who cares
no way that you're making better
decision over eight heads up tables than
I am Against One Singular opponent in a
live realm where I have all day to think
about what it is that I'm doing and it
never correlated to me like uh the
diminishing returns of time spent versus
you know like okay so maybe my hourly is
like 5x is high but I can only play that
one singular table and you know whatever
the business side of it eluded me I was
still very much into the Romantic side
and I kind of Built My Career off of
that right it was like that's why I kept
pursuing higher stakes and why I was so
willing to go broke all the time because
I refused to play 3 000 hours in a year
like I did not get into poker to work a
full-time job and then some
um so for me it was just like okay I
made a quarter million this year playing
10 20 and I played a thousand hours I
don't think I could play more hours and
uh there's bigger games so whatever is
next right like if I want to make a half
a million then I guess we're gonna have
to play 25.50 that's all uh and that was
just the way that I always viewed it so
I probably didn't
that might be why I'm still here right
that might be part of the survivorship
bias is that at least one of those shots
panned out and it allowed me to survive
but more importantly like I didn't play
tens of thousands of hours to the point
where like I just hate this game and uh
especially now where if I feel like it's
tough to be a volume guy right
especially as an American what do you do
right all the soft money is live
uh it's impossible to play a Sunday
schedule where you actually get in any
reasonable volume you know so uh I I
kind of feel like it's come full circle
where uh if if we look at the bell curve
of of the poker trajectory over 20 years
it was like yes start with live playing
One Singular table uh you know and make
as much money as you possibly can fleece
everybody for what they got and then
online boom put in volume that's like
the apex of the the bell curve and then
on the back side post Black Friday is
just like transition back into live make
all the soft money and and do it slowly
um I like what you said there about
keeping that romanticized relationship
with polka where your friends were
around to try to tell you to play high
volume or at least they were that was my
Approach I did heads-ups and goals
myself I didn't even know about League
volume three years in a row almost
killed me twice and you get this kind of
time for money kind of equation where
you're like you can know your rois quite
clearly and you're playing so much
volume that you can predict where you're
going to be over the course of months
and years but at the same time you lose
that enjoyment almost all the people I
know who um did the same Pursuits the
Superman League grains they fell out of
love with pork out the grind at some
stage because it's just not fun to do it
that way so like what you said like
keeping that yeah the kind of enjoyment
of Poker and I think like almost like
life as we get become adults we almost
totally grow up grow up be sensible get
realistic work hard stop enjoying what
you're doing we almost get that beaten
out of us so we can uh get a real job or
do something kind of meaningful for you
I like that even now you still love the
game you're still looking for the right
games to play the right action you still
get that enthusiasm to play in my aim so
I think you're approach that you've
chose over your friends and mine at
least for a longer career at least for a
healthier longer relationship so related
consciously mostly unconsciously or your
personality but I think it's LED you to
yeah enjoy the game for a lot longer
than other people I think it leads to uh
other endeavors that are like ancillary
to the space like you guys are creating
this podcast this takes a lot of time
out of your out of your day but it's
it's kind of a byproduct of still having
a passion and love for the game and not
being in love with putting in mass
volume and just collecting an hourly
100 yeah I think sometimes you don't
realize like what branches open up later
down the line once you get a skill of
something and you're passionate for an
area there's so many different areas
within that you haven't thought about I
remember when I was playing poker I
still play poker make money and then
transition into something completely
different like a complete new idea start
a business in a very different field but
once you instant then you enjoy it you
know it very well doors open up which
are over time evolve but like yeah it
puts some time into and passion for it
that you've get good old opportunities
which are available

poker career but for now without further
Ado let's get back into more goodness in
today's episode
so right now I was going to ask you
um your passion for poker your
relationship with poker did it ever turn
unhealthy or do you feel like you had a
good balance throughout your career I
was also not really a volume guy so I
guess that helps prevent you from
getting bored of the game and making it
less enjoyable I think also
the mindset with which you get into
poker probably also determines the
volume let's say you go into poker for
the money aspect of it and then you do
this multiplying in your head like wait
did my roommates this I play this many
hands here and I said because you think
about the money aspect I never thought
in terms of how much my hourly was
Voting but I've never throughout my
whole career up until today calculated
my hourly this is not something that
that I think of I I think of Poker as
you know somewhere I go to to try to
grow as a player to try to grow as a
person I like new strategies I like the
problem solving of it I like to be
curious towards new strategies and I
know this very quickly once for example
there's no more new novelty in my game
so when I'm not working on a new
strategy it actually becomes very hard
for me to put in the volume like burnout
is around the corner as long as there's
no new novelty for example I remember
when I was at the peak of my career as
well uh there was a I think actually it
was it was my boyfriend I remember
pretty quickly he he he wrote in chat
why do you always make the tree so
complicated
but like I do that on purpose you know
it might you know I don't care if it's
up to more optimal I like to be creative
you know because it keeps it it keeps
things fun for me and sure you know that
that I will blunder sometimes but
sometimes also I'll make a great play
but this is what makes the game
enjoyable for me on the same time if I
reflect on my career volume is also the
thing that I've liked the most so it's
it's kind of a double-edged sword again
on one side it helped me become the
player that I am today because I put it
a lot of time into strategy because
that's what I liked right and I
preferred study time over playing
therefore I did have a higher win rate
than average players so that kind of
made up for it but still the high volume
players would in the end make more money
than me also people who actually went
into poker with the goal of making money
I I'm just I'm just the the gamer you
know I like I like the the strategy
aspect of it so
yeah I think I think I think not being
volume driven has its has its benefits
and its downside actually also at one
point you're touching on that wedding
where you talked with the online guy
he also needs to play a bit more from
his own strategy if you play let's say
six tables at the same time right it
kind of you have to standardize
decisions a little bit more and I guess
when you start to standardize your
decision there's less room for the for
for the creativity and if you're if what
attracts you to poker is how deep it can
go and how much creative lines you can
execute if that is something that really
drives your your you your joy out of
Poker if you remove that then you will
burn out Bush probably so I guess you're
a very creative player as well the life
environment also encourages you to be is
that then if we would remove that you
would just think poker is very boring
yeah if live were if live were removed I
would have quit a very long time ago I I
just can't do it
um I've always kind of beat by My Own
Drum and I almost like relished the idea
of being called Bad
because uh it's one of those things
where it's like
bad objectively exist right like there
there there's a spectrum of bad
you know less less bad average good
great Elite whatever and wherever I fell
on that Spectrum I just knew that it was
impossible that I was actually bad
because I just made too much money right
like not that that's the end-all be-all
but
um over a long duration of time I just
had too many positive results to believe
in any way shape or form that I actually
was like on the far end of the spectrum
of just being bad but there were a lot
of my peers who truly perceived me to be
there and almost relished in the idea it
was just like
I didn't ever want to give in to the
collective because I always felt like
there was money to be made by doing
something different uh so my MTT career
not that it was anything luxurious or
anything like that but most of my MTT
success was between like 2008 and 2014
and it was all predicated off of a
limping strategy that I developed
because
people played like [ __ ] pre-flop facing
a limp and uh you know I was reg
battling the the 109 rebuy on stars for
the better part of two years and I like
one of the higher rois and I never open
raised uh but no one adjusted even
though the player pool was you know a
couple hundred people of the same regs
day in and day out the arrogance around
a 20-something
who is making money hand over fist is
far greater than uh the obvious
deviation that could make them a few
more cents on the dollar right it
doesn't work now because everybody has
pre-flop charts and you know people just
rather well but you know back then it
was like when you limped suddenly you
would get isolated by hands that
wouldn't have opened raised if it folded
to them and that's just a lot of money
like I didn't know how it was making EV
for me but like it just was and I kind
of understood that right it's like it
ranges didn't really exist but if you
understood that you had playable hands
and non-playable hands and you could be
dynamic with those constructions you
could look at the table Dynamics and say
like oh okay
um this guy has a reshuff stack and this
guy's prone to ice of me light I have
Aces I'm gonna limp right and then you
just get that exact scenario where it
goes raise Jam
you have Aces right pretty pretty great
spot and uh there was enough Queen jack
off suits and Ace eight off suits and
things like that turned over where it's
like if I had opened I would not have
gotten this scenario so that was like
always encouraging to me uh to to pursue
alternative strategies now obviously
alternative strategies are very
different right because we're there are
guard rails and very few people are
willing to just shirk them
um I think Adamo is a great example of
somebody who is a little bit more
willing to take the guardrails off and
and explore the unexplored
um but even he is still operating from a
pretty core
space because he has to the environment
dictates it right like you cannot go
into the High Roller scene and just be
by your own drum in every note of the
game tree right you have to play pretty
disciplined poker in most spots but
when you play a live cash game 500 plus
big blinds deep there is no guard rail
anymore right because Theory as we know
it is just going to tell you to check a
whole bunch
until you arrive at the river and your
nuts or air spot and then the uncapped
range should just like shovel all the
[ __ ] money in you know single raids
pot five big blinds in the middle
everybody checks down to the river and
then the uncapped range just like 50
x-pots like you know that that's that's
a reasonable
uh kind of outcome for how deep stack
poker will play but that's not what
humans are going to do we don't like
that asymmetric risk reward proposition
uh it's almost actually never going to
play out that way instead it's gonna be
a lot of probing and a lot of gradually
growing the pot until suddenly it's only
a 2X pod on the shovel on the end and
now if you have a pretty good grasp of
cap first uncapped and uh you know how
polarization works there's a lot of
[ __ ] Edge to gain because people are
putting way too much money in with hands
that are just supposed to play pretty
passively and defensively uh so that's
that's my passion I guess and why I've
always gravitated towards live is
because
humans are fallible and they're far more
fallible when they have to look you in
the face and they're not doing a bunch
of diligent work that could be applied
over volume
interesting point
I the the volume
the volume equation I wanted to maybe
add one more thing here that
for me personally and maybe you can
relate I this is actually something that
I think I've discovered a bit more
recently when I was trying to analyze
okay in terms of my career what could I
do better and volume is definitely I
would say the number one thing now
obviously a certain standardization of
your strategy is part of that I do think
there's still a lot of room uh for
creativity even in today's world like I
said obviously we're a bit more
restricted because you know players are
playing more closer to Optimal so we
cannot deviate as much anymore for
example but I think it's also a common
misconception that people think that oh
GTO you know it's this boring thing that
just kills the game I mean if you give
if you only if you give the solver you
know some options he is definitely
Relentless like you said just shoveling
50x pop well good luck there's nothing
boring about shoving 50x pod in my
opinion right right
um but what I notice in terms of uh you
also touched on the need for control and
that was actually a very big leak or is
actually a very big leak when it comes
down to volume for me because
because I want to control it so much
playing multiple tables and making more
mistakes and focusing more on volume and
lacking the quality of my play I find
that very hard to deal with in terms of
then that I will make more mistakes but
also something that I recently realized
is I always took quite a lot of pride in
terms of how I live around being a poker
player how I prepare for sessions how I
analyze after sessions but I recently
noticed that the frame was wrong like in
terms of over preparation I already knew
that a long time ago that that was
actually wrong it was just me trying to
prepare in a way to reduce certain
precession anxieties for example which
had more to do with a fear of making
mistakes a fear of loss and all these
kind of things so I had to work on
actually resolving those instead of
building insane pre-session routines for
example if I only slept six hours or
five hours I'd be like okay today is
[ __ ] I'm gonna just study all day and
then try to sleep at least eight hours
next day so I can actually play that's
obviously this cost you a lot of volume
this is obviously not the right way
obviously we should try to prepare in a
way that allows us to show up you know
at a decent level but this this
surpassed the point and recently I
noticed as well with analyzing in terms
of after playing that I had the strong
needs to analyze my game especially if
things were not going well and I always
thought actually that was a good thing
which you know we can debate is a good
thing but the frame from which I'm doing
it was wrong which it was mainly to
remove the feeling of doubt and I was
trying to create more control around the
uncontrollable so I needed to get
closure okay I needed to rationalize or
analyze away the feeling of that I lost
in a session okay so that I could 100
say that if it was my fault why it was
my fault and immediately went into
Improvement mindset or that I could
blame it on variants did you do you how
do you deal with like that uncertainty
part of the game
while you already mentioned that you
were very much a person that needs a
certain control right like a lot of a
lot of variables in poker are uncertain
you know we can have a decision and if
it's good or bad yeah we just don't know
how do you deal with that those
uncertainties uh you and I are very
similar and also very different at the
same time
um I I think that I have a similar view
of volume and the lifestyle around the
game uh I I say this very often that I'm
probably half as rich and twice as happy
as uh the the alternative version of me
that was giveness yeah
um yeah I just I did not capitalize
nearly enough on the opportunities
presented to me as far as like money
goes but I couldn't be happier with like
the lifestyle that I've created for
myself and
um the way that I've utilized my time
throughout the years uh as far as like
recession post session we're the exact
opposite I I have little to no anxiety
going into play I have this deep deep
deep sense of self-trust and I think
it's a byproduct of playing live because
the control aspect actually comes from
putting all the weight on yourself to be
able to analyze a situation in real time
right I'm not restricted to uh uh
executing a preconceived strategy where
uh my hand kind of gets slapped if I
steer off the beaten path without good
justification right I'm kind of free
in-game uh to just react and trust those
reactions uh and I will say like what
used to harm me in the past was
rationalizing those reactions in
hindsight right we didn't really have a
methodology uh to analyze it in real
time because we didn't really have
strategies to operate off of you were
just truly freestyling it all points now
I have a baseline to at least compare it
to so I have to acknowledge when I make
a deviation in real time that it was a
deviation right and I have to sit with
that and I I have to understand that
that's happening
um
but because that's my process and
because that's largely happening in game
and I'm making these adjustments on the
Fly uh I also don't have any sense of
urgency to review a session after the
fact
um most of my games now are played on
live stream and it takes me days if not
weeks to actually go back and re-watch
um
not not for fear of exposing
inconsistencies or mistakes but kind of
the opposite I'm afraid to go back and
see that I played too close to Baseline
and left a bunch of money on the table
uh I I'm afraid to lose that identity of
the guy who's willing to just like get
in the arena and battle it out bare
knuckle Style with with no AIDS or tools
uh and I feel myself in game
gravitating more and more towards the
theoretical solution in a spot that I
just [ __ ] know is wrong right like
just gravitating towards like you're way
way too high up to fold here man he only
bet three quarters pot like you just
can't let this one go but
you've played in the live realm long
enough you you've played against this
player type enough times that you know
75 pot doesn't mean the same thing to
him as it does the theory and you know
that that is a bounded range coming at
you not a balanced one and you know that
this guy hasn't found a bluff for three
streets since the Reagan Administration
right you know all of these things but
you're so saturated by what is
mathematically corrected theoretically
correct that you start to lose your way
a little bit it's hard to find that
North Star when you're operating with
two compasses that point in opposite
directions and and that's kind of the
the difficulty that I've found myself
struggling through
um as I've kind of really nurtured the
the learning process uh
there's a certain sense of power to
being ignorant and Blissful right like
uh that that phrase exists for a reason
now don't get me wrong I think that uh
it would be a very big problem in 2022
but God Did It serve me well in 2016
because the fact of the matter is uh I
wasn't very sharp on Modern strategy at
the time but everybody who claimed that
they were also wasn't like looking back
in hindsight they didn't know [ __ ]
either and the things that they thought
they knew were really really good were
just like mediocre at best they were
just functionally working because
pretty much anything that you did with
conviction was going to work back then
you know uh
so like I look back at that time frame
and I'm I'm so envious for that former
self because I was playing Stakes that
will probably never exist in the live
realm consistently again and I was doing
so
as though I was like trying to
figure out how to beat one two no limit
on Zynga you know I was I was literally
just looking around at the characters
and saying like well how do you deal
with a ten thousand dollar sleeper
straddle when you're playing three six
twelve No Limit you know and it was like
forget all that how do you deal with
Rick Solomon right like that's that's
what I'm really trying to solve that's
the only thing that matters is that I I
get to play against this man and he has
certain Tendencies and I need to get the
bottom of it I need to be a detective
um so yeah I think my process has
adjusted but not so much in the
mechanical sense uh just more so in the
emotional sense I I don't
I don't feel the anxieties anymore I
don't feel like I said I don't feel
those low moments nearly as often if
ever where I'm just beating myself up
over decisions
um if anything I I feel like
that that imposter syndrome I say it all
the time because I really do feel like
this overlooming sense of the better
that I get the worse I feel like I
actually am uh and it really does
project out because now I feel like I'm
also losing my identity along the way
yeah that that sounds familiar you
touched on that uh 300 600 1200 game
again yeah and I wanted to I wanted to
go back to that because that was right
after that great series that you had and
you mentioned that you capitalize an
opportunity to play the 306 on the 12 on
an Irish room how did that come about
uh so kind of a funny story this is [ __ ]
that only happens in Vegas
um during my come up uh the Venetian was
like the big No Limit room uh in the
like
early 2010s so like 2009 did like
2012-ish
um
that was like the spot to get all the
loose action there was always the
Bellagio 10 20 game uh but that was you
know a very different crowd as it still
is today the Venetian was like 5 10
uncapped so it was where the people who
were trying to transition to the 1020
largely played and then every now and
again out of the blue like these bigger
games would just crop up uh sometimes
Jamie gold would pop into town and then
play 25.50
um you know other times it would be uh
big call Kenny Tran or you know whoever
like people just randomly pop into town
and the Venetian would be the place that
they would go because they could always
get a table there the Bellagio was
always overrun and also you know the
Sharks would just come swarming whenever
soft games would appear but the Venetian
they had a lot of privacy they could
organize games uh no big deal so
um there was a man named Bob Bright uh
you guys are probably familiar with him
he plays on poker quite often and he was
in every one of those games anytime that
uh a 10 20 game would pop up or bigger
he was always a staple of them
and I was lucky enough because that was
kind of my home casino that I would get
to you know work my way into these games
a lot I would just be there so I could
hop on the list whenever they would
start whatever and we played together a
fair amount and you know he's he's just
so rich money does not matter to him it
was all about the game it was all about
putting people to tough spots and he
[ __ ] tortured me uh in a in an
emotional way like he just always put me
to the toughest decisions and I always
made the toughest calls like there were
literally times where I would have case
money on the table and he [ __ ] knew
it like I know he knew it and I know
that nothing would make him happier than
getting a kick out of like breaking a 30
year old who was gonna have to go sweep
floors for a few months to to get his
roll back up like that's how he came up
you know he came up initially building
his role as a blackjack player before he
got banned from all casinos and stuff
like that you know that that was how he
made his first hundred thousand couple
hundred thousand and then eventually he
discovered or uh he founded this Trading
Company and made hundreds of millions
whatever but uh you know having brushed
elbows with a lot of the Bob Bright
types of this world
they have a chip on their shoulder you
know they they believe very much so in
the Ben CB mindset of like I busted my
ass you're gonna bust yours you don't
get to just play a [ __ ] game for a
living and get away with it so there was
always this big challenge uh and uh I I
remember the last time we played at the
Venetian
um I had a bluff catcher of some sort
but I had case money on the table for
sure we were playing 10 20. and he put
me all in for like 12 000 on the river
into like a 4K pot
and I tanked long enough that the game
broke around us it was like a 12 minute
tank on the river and I wasn't thinking
about anything like I just had a bluff
catcher and it was all my money so I'm
just like running through all the
emotions of what happens if I call and I
lose uh you know would he actually ever
Bluff here yada yada just running
through all of it right and I'm trying
to get a read on him in the process it's
2012. I'm just trying to you know figure
out what the [ __ ] going on eventually
I make the call and you just
um
nice call and he just Staples the bluff
you know and I win a very meaningful pot
to me so uh I kind of befriended him
after that we played a lot locally in uh
the games that would rotate casino to
casino and
it must have been late 2012 early 2013.
um he Bobby Baldwin jrb
Ben lamb and a handful of others had
started playing 200 400 in Ivy's room
which was like pretty much brand new at
the time
um and he would always come to these
smaller games almost kind of like to
flex on us uh uh us little peons you
know he'd come play a little 5 10 20
Splash around with the with with the
common folk and be like oh well I lost
uh I lost 200 000 in the market today
and then I played 200 400 yesterday you
know that kind of stuff and he would
always leave and say you have an invite
anytime you want it kid and I would just
you know be sitting there staring at my
last five thousand dollars being like
okay uh
I'm gonna take you up on I met me while
like you know believing that I'm never
gonna have a shot in Hell sitting in
that game
um I fast forward like a year and a half
I went from broke to pretty flush and we
were playing this 5 10 20 game and uh
you know it was it was actually small
for me at that time because I was flush
again and I was just kind of like I'm
bored Bob I'm gonna take off he's like
well we have a 200 400 game on Thursday
and I'm like yeah
he's like we'd love to have you I'm like
you would he's like yeah off her stands
I'm like I'm in
uh so I you know hit up a couple buddies
sold uh
uh what I thought was enough action
which in hindsight almost certainly
wasn't I probably had like 10 15 of my
net worth on the table
um went I lost small but like had a
really enjoyable time with everybody uh
they really seemed to take to me they
liked my action the game was just like
pretty tight passive it was it was the
it was the more dead of the lineup so to
speak it was it was a clear tryout
um and I got to play the game a couple
of times until uh you know Jeremy and I
swapped numbers which was a good sign he
got me a box of Dr and I'm just like oh
my God I'm one of them this is this is
great and uh I just got the text one day
he's like 300 600 1200 100K minimum
buy-in you in it's like
no turning back now you're gonna have to
figure out a way to to get my way in
there that's like you know I have two
buy-ins to my name but yeah I'm [ __ ]
in
um so I worked out a backing deal uh
where initially we were massively
massively under rolled and I had way too
big of a piece
um
but we did okay we did okay out of the
gate I the first year I ended up like
profiting maybe a million million and a
half uh and we had like the whole role
on the table
dozens of times uh so many times I was I
think we had like a million dollar role
to start with which was literally 10
buy-ins uh there was so many times I was
down to like the final 200 and I would
run it up to like six or eight and then
uh it all culminated in this night where
I just got invited to like the sickest
game like one of those games where I'm
never getting a seat to start
but it was still running somehow eight
hours in and nobody had left except Bob
Wright so I got to take his seat so it
was like jrb Rick Solomon uh pat pat
Panda which if you guys are familiar
with him at one point he was like the
biggest loser in online history uh this
kid from Macau
um all the Macau guys this is like way
back in 2014 so it was before they
really knew how to play so all the guys
from Detroit and tour palfua Etc
and uh Robo Robo was the only Pro so I
get to come in and uh you know Rick is
sitting like two million deep and
sleeper straddling to 10K and I'm trying
to abide by my
guidelines to the deal so I buy them for
a hundred thousand and the first pot I
watch is like five bet to 75 000 pre and
I'm just like texting my guys I'm like
I think we have to sit with it all
like what do you mean I'm just like well
I just watched like four hands pre-flop
where half of my stack would have to be
committed like I don't know what you
want me to do if I get pocket AIDS but
I'm not folding them
so like
we have 650 man I think we just sit with
it
either like we trust you
so I sat with it ended up winning 1.4
million that night and never [ __ ]
look back well that's not true I went on
a big downswing but like uh I I was I
was good with them from that point
moving forward
all right interesting you you said they
liked my action right is that very
important because like I know nothing
about the live round but I do understand
you know that a lot of stuff are private
there's a lot of politics
if I if I go play live how can I have
them like my action so I get divided
invited in a game like that 2022 is
tough because uh now if you look like
you know what you're doing you almost
certainly know what you're doing right
like it's it's pretty tough to hide I
mean you could just bet half pot on
every street you could use a one sizing
Strat
that uh is just largely handcuffing you
um to give you for instance Ben lamb was
one of the original people who was uh in
the game after like two or three months
of him winning too much they made it so
he was not allowed to raise pre-flop so
he could do whatever he wanted but he
could only limp
and he couldn't three bet uh like uh I
think that's what it was he could only
three bet if he like called a rate but
like if he limped he couldn't limp raise
is is the point I'm trying to get at so
they basically restricted him pre-flop
to like having to go post he's still
whatever man you're giving Evie back
he's still a big winner in the game
right it's just annoying uh and then
eventually like he was still winning too
much that way and they just kicked him
out
um
but yeah like 2012 2013 there was no
strategy right so uh it was very easy to
manufacture
or as like I like to refer to it just
like offer them a rebate right if you
have the luxury of playing with seven
amateurs that are all pretty bad or
terrible at this game in one way or
another some give too much action some
don't give enough whatever
um it's your duty as the winning player
and the person who is a welcomed guest
to offer them Evie back somehow and you
know a lot of the ways that I did that
was I would cap my bet sizings so like I
didn't really over bet much if ever
outside of against Pros and that's kind
of tough whenever you know even though
it was like 2013 2014 whatever and we
weren't super studied into that I I had
an idea of why it would come in handy
and you're like you had a gist of when
to do it
um but I would often just not because
if the difference between me betting 80
pot and two pots was the difference
between
uh me dragging a 150 000 pot off Bob
Bright with a smile on his face versus
him shaking his head and [ __ ]
me under his breath it was worth giving
up that extra 120 of the pot like it
wasn't even a question
um and yeah I would just do things that
would I I referred to myself as a
facilitator like all the money flowed
through me and I would just take a cut
along the way right like I would open 5x
and you know they're used to a pace of
play in a certain game Flow where it's
like it goes raise you get to call with
a bunch of hands a couple people call
behind you with a bunch of hands and you
know there's a kind of three betting
that goes on but that's usually for two
blinds or three blinds whatever I'm
opening for five blinds and they're not
adjusting anything so it's still just
like going call call and now the spr is
massively shrunk in post and they're all
in a lot more often and it just it feels
it's a rush it's adrenaline to them like
they're getting action even though all
of the hands are still the same as if it
was being open to two and a half X right
the only difference is like now they're
all in on the turn as opposed to not
being all in at all and like they like
that they like that that feeling they
felt like they could beat me for a big
number and then they did they often did
you know uh now I don't think there's
anything you could do
to kind of present that level of action
outside of like what Keating is doing
which is just advertising you know he's
just literally playing 89 V pip and
taking it all to the river to see what
happens
it's a very interesting variable to take
in consideration playing a strategy that
helps you stay in the game right or to
yeah like I said they don't like the
face of bats they probably also don't
like to you to three bet them all the
time right you know so you kind of
adjust to to make them have a good time
you sacrifice sacrifice somebody uh EV I
mean you know you know that you're gonna
make good decisions post-op anyway like
in the key 10 example you know just the
80 of your hands you can still minimize
the impact I mean 80 is quite a lot but
you know you can still you can still
minimize the impact the EV loss of that
buy you know at least maneuvering both
slop in a certain way so yeah it's it's
very interesting uh interesting I think
to take into consideration sorry I I
think the the big thing that is
overlooked that people don't understand
and why these games go private WHY games
are so bad is that uh as important as it
is when playing tough competition to get
each Street correct uh the truth of the
matter is when you're playing against
weak competition that pretty much plays
at least a portion of the range face up
all of the EV every single last penny of
it is exchanged on the river
right so it's like that's where all the
big bets go in that's where all the
major decisions are made uh and that's
where your bottom line is going to be
derived from so whatever Pennies on the
dollar you're giving up before the Flop
by playing too many hands or by uh
calling too many open raises or whatever
and then whatever you're giving up by
like C betting half putt instead of
quarter pot because quarter pot looks
proy it doesn't matter it just doesn't
matter you're recouping 100 of it and
then some uh every single time you
arrive at the river and a lot of money
goes in the middle
yeah people often overestimate the EV of
the quote-quote correct play that's
basically what you're saying right
solver approved ranges don't take in
consideration the fact that the guy is
going to play his hand face up on the
river and make huge mistakes then
obviously you are very much incentivized
to play more hands still the river where
he gives away all the information right
the more information the higher if you
decision but obviously the solver does
it doesn't give away any information it
doesn't make a leak so they're obviously
getting to that street it's not worth a
lot in the solver worlds but in practice
it can be worth quite a lot of money
yeah
that's it but despite that you did at
some point uh you know you were doing
very well he said never looked back but
there was a little a little a little a
little hiccup along the road right where
at some point because you know we
usually ask the people like what you
know what was like a rock bottom moment
blah blah and at some point like you
just wrote there was like oh and I was
out of five million makeup and I was
like well I I didn't read that anywhere
like rock by the moment so at some point
you were down 5 million which for
pre-podcast you said bye it's only you
know 40 40 buyings or something
how did you experience that moment I
mean we already talked you know you
touched on this perseverance before with
baseball uh going broke 10 years in your
career you talked about focusing a lot
on controllable barriers variables uh
process oriented thinking try to be the
best self yada yada yada all this kind
of stuff were these how did you stay
positive or at least have a positive
outlook when you were down 5 million
like a lot of people would have quit and
never saw the upside of it but you
decided to like
I'll continue I mean uh well it was hard
I don't want to I don't want to reduce
it to uh just a shorter shrug and uh I
just you know packed my lunch pail every
day and got on with it uh it was
definitely trying it was mentally brutal
it was emotionally brutal but uh all
those key points that you kind of uh
highlighted where I had some sort of
struggle and had the opportunity to quit
um it's easy to say that like
I
it was me that chose not to and it was
me that powered through and persevered
and everything else but the truth of the
matter is if you look at each and every
one of those situations yeah I may have
done the work and I may have made the
choice to not quit but it was all fueled
by having like just an incredible
support system along the way uh and that
was probably never more true than in
this particular instance of being on the
five million downswing because the fact
of the matter is no matter what I wanted
to do no matter what my desire was or my
belief that my win rate was uh or my
ability to recoup none of that matters
if nobody will financially back me right
so in this particular instance the fact
that my backing crew was willing to
tough it out
and say like okay we we think that
you're still winning and the fact that
you're losing this much just means that
you have more invites
um
get your [ __ ] together and get after it
right like that was all the
encouragement that I needed and
you know was it like a light switch just
went off and I was like okay these guys
like I was sweating it every every
million I lost I was like they're
they're cutting me like today's the day
that they caught me for sure and I don't
know where that that it may have
literally been the last buy and I might
have been on my last buy and when I
turned things around I'll never know
right
um it sure as hell felt like it that
that's there's no doubt about that uh
uh but yeah I mean it was tough I lost
like 24 out of 26 sessions
and the thing with that game is uh
I didn't get the best seats so there
were plenty of games that I just like
wasn't getting invited to I was probably
playing on average like twice a week
so to lose 24 of 26 sessions and go on a
five million dollar downswing that's
over the course of like seven months
you know it's like so spread out and you
have all this down time in between to
just like lament your situation
uh now what made it a little bit easier
is that I had made a bunch of money in
the game and wasn't at a very high
Financial Risk right so if they had cut
me
it's going to be a lot more
damaging to like my
I guess social standing maybe uh it'll
be very damaging to my ego it'll
certainly be damaging to my belief in
myself moving forward as a professional
poker player but
financially I'm probably still going to
walk away with seven figures right and
that seems like an okay place to
start over I guess and figure [ __ ] out
um so I think that there might even have
been a part of me that that was kind of
like leaning into that like I hope they
cut me like I'm ready to
just fall flat on my face again and
figure out what the next step is because
this is brutal like I just don't want
this anymore but uh luckily or unluckily
I guess depending on your Vantage Point
um life kind of always finds a way of
stepping in
uh at the peak of this downswing it had
been six or seven months uh uh or so and
I was playing a World Series event
um that I was actually doing quite well
and I think I was like chip leader
midday two or something like that and on
break I just get a phone call from my
sister and she says mom OD'd last night
uh uh she's dead
uh We're not gonna have a funeral for
her I just wanted to let you know kind
of thing
I was like holy [ __ ] like that's that's
pretty sobering
um
and I didn't really know how to take it
my mother and I didn't have a super
close relationship but in spite of all
her flaws in spite of all her addiction
problems and the fact that she was you
know only half of an adult for the
majority of my life she was also like
one of my biggest cheerleaders and you
know even though I didn't really respect
her lifestyle uh she was a very warm
individual to me and like very much
cuddled and uh created this self-belief
I I guess I had if by no other way then
like by forcing me to kind of take care
of her and her darkest moments right uh
it's it's very sobering as a 12 year old
to to kind of see your mother passed out
in a drug-induced stupor and have to
ensure that she gets fed and washed and
all this [ __ ] so I grew up very fast in
that regard and became very mature and
uh when she passed I had these like
mixed emotions of do I even care of
course I care but like how much do I
care how impactful is this on me
uh it it was a little bit dark like I
didn't even feel obligated to go home
especially because it was an
inconvenience to me in the middle of the
World Series and I kind of just tried to
play through it but it was it was very
clear that I wasn't okay uh like
upstairs
um literally weeks after that I get a
call from my grandmother telling me that
she had just gotten back from her doctor
and she's diagnosed with stage four
uterine cancer uh now my grandparents
were godsends to me they they basically
raised me uh my grandmother my
grandfather were like two of the most
powerful most influential people in my
life and uh especially after my granddad
died you know this is probably like 13
years later my grandmother outlived him
her and I became insanely close like she
very much filled the void that he left
behind so that was devastating to me and
I had the exact opposite reaction right
as soon as I found out I dropped
everything and I just moved home uh
didn't tell anybody didn't even like Lil
J R B know that I was going to be gone
like eventually you know I got text back
to him was like listen I just need some
time away with family yada yada but
um
yeah I just like picked up everything
went went home she was still good
spirits uh she just found out about the
diagnosis so uh they just stopped chemo
and you know they gave her uh a few like
I think they gave her like six to ten
weeks at the time
um and she never asked she never asked
for anything she never she never put it
on me she never even asked me to come
home uh but it just became very apparent
within a few days like I'm going to be
your caregiver uh while you pass and uh
I would just remember like having to do
everything all over again like uh she
very quickly declined and like wasn't
able to use the bathroom wasn't able to
shower so I basically became a 24 7
nurse uh which is not a glamorous
position and not one that I would
necessarily recommend to anybody but
also one that is so incredibly powerful
with a loved one like to learn how to
care for somebody in that
State it's it's probably one of the most
important things that I've ever done in
my entire life like nothing has impacted
me the way that this did uh and I just
remember like writing every emotion
imaginable
um she ended up making it for like three
and a half four months or so
uh uh and I was
studying as best I could I knew that I
was going to be coming back to a big
mess that I had to clean up that I'd
left behind and I wanted to be in better
position for it
um and at the time uh Christian and I uh
my partner itself for why we were like I
was coaching him and and we were working
pretty hard so he was kind of like
forcing me to distract myself a little
bit with poker here and there and I was
putting in a lot of hours a lot of work
uh once she finally passed uh it really
it felt like a weight was lifted not in
the sense of
um I'm glad she's gone but more so in
the sense of uh
uh nothing could possibly be
as gut wrenching as this experience so
whatever poker has in store for me when
I get back is going to pale by
comparison like I'm just I'm just ready
for it kind of thing uh came back
obviously I had been getting crushed and
uh everybody knew why I was gone so they
welcomed me back with open arms and I
just raped it I could not lose I've
never been so locked in I ended up
winning like 25 of 27 sessions so I
basically flipped the exact loss rate
that I had on its head and it all
culminated with uh Ozzy Matt and I
playing heads up in a game that I barely
know the rules to we played heads up PLO
uh I beat him out of like 1.7 million
just prior to that I had final table
with the super high rollerball for 1.1
million like these are all things that
are not my technical skill set right
like MTT poker yeah I'm competent but
like I'm not Elite by any stretch
play one of the toughest Fields out
there final tape weight for seven
figures play a you know Proclaim PLO
experts uh in Matt and granted he was on
lip he was on tilt I would have played
him heads up in tiddlywinks he was so
tilted that night uh he actually played
me the next night calm and beat the [ __ ]
out of me as he should but uh when it
was all said and done and the dust
settled I was actually like plus a
million so that 15-month span
uh who was like an entire career just
like crammed into uh a year a year and a
half type type time frame and
um yeah I guess I didn't put it as like
the low moment because truly 2012 was so
much worse that was so much more of a
Crossroads of I don't know what the [ __ ]
I'm gonna do with my life if if this
isn't it where here I was going to be
financially fine and uh you know I was
going through personal stuff with my
family uh but you know that that's just
kind of the byproducts of life you hate
to look at uh losing a loved one and
call it the lowest point of your life or
anything like that
yeah very very deep stuff it was very
interesting to me how you then after
that experience you obviously it's a
terrible experience but at the same time
also you found it I guess a beautiful
experience can I say it that way no yeah
sure yeah uh
I would give up every penny I've ever
made to relive that three four month
period like there's nothing on Earth I
would have ever traded uh to to be there
as her caregiver I can't explain like
how critically important that was yeah
that's I guess also why you don't name
it a rock bottom moment because it had I
guess you know it had two sides to it
and afterwards you were able to put
anything that happens after that in
perspective like listen I went through
this uh whatever poker throws at me I'm
ready so I guess also you know then
there's you come back and it's like yeah
obviously you care but it's almost like
yeah just just throw it at me it doesn't
matter anymore and maybe then also you
know obviously there's some luck
involved but I do also believe in like
yeah a certain attraction then a sort of
mindset that you're in that you that you
kind of manifest uh good things
happening to you uh you mentioned in
that time in between that you know
you're at your buddy that you were
studying with he was trying to distract
you a little bit and you mentioned you
studied the best you could uh you put it
a ton of work in out of curiosity from a
technical perspective what does one put
working in a game where you have to 5x
cannot over bet some people have to only
limp how does a strategy session look
like for for format Berkey at that
moment you know it's very different than
modern day online poker players are used
to which are probably going to be the
majority of our listeners yeah honestly
uh it's not that far removed from how I
still approach it the only difference is
the tools that we were utilizing
um but it was very much
broad Strokes zoomed out uh Theory
principle approach right uh and that's
still how I studied to this day it's
it's like at that time we found itself
for why and that's why I I named the
company what I did like why is so much
more critical to me than like what or
how I don't care that much about
execution I care so much more deeply
about what's the purpose behind the
decision that we're about to make and
that was always the framework that I
operated from and that's why uh you know
referencing back to that conversation I
had at the wedding where I basically say
like look I go in with a loose framework
but my whole goal my job is to brain
solve each and every decision treat them
each uniquely and try to extract as much
value out of every one of them that I
possibly can and you know for him he's a
volume guy who who grew up in a very
very Tech he he rose to the ranks and
got out of Poker all within like a 36
month window it's like Jesus Christ like
that's
that's that's barely a heartbeat as far
as like I'm concerned like that that's a
swing for me is 36 months so
um
it was never technical it was very much
just like General and conceptualizing
like okay in general
uh we have three player types and it's
gonna be like loose aggressive loose
passive and then tight passive how do we
approach each of these situations like
what does my three bet range look like
versus one as compared to the other so
I'll give you for instance
um and this is this will hopefully paint
a good picture because this has nothing
to do with po solver or or anything of
those nature like the strategy that I
developed when Andrew Roble was in the
game was that I would never three bet
him just never I played zero three bet
percentage against him because I knew he
was a better pre-flop player than me but
I felt like if I utilized position and
whatever deep stack skill Edge I had uh
with regard to flops turns of rivers
specifically Rivers it would work out my
benefit and
in so many ways it did right in so many
ways I got to play bigger single raised
pots than ever should have been played
because I show up with hands of value
that shouldn't exist like Aces uh Ace
King and then secondarily I would just
pick up so much free money when the
squeezes would come through or uh the
over calls would come through with like
trashy hands that would just make
inferior single Pairs and whatnot uh I'm
only I'm only saying that because it's a
demonstration of how many different ways
there are to derive EV
in uh in an environment that doesn't
play by the rules of course game theory
is pertinent to our study now when we're
looking at these isolated scenarios of
position a versus position b in a heads
up single race pot position a versus
position b in a heads up three bet plot
right where we're abstracting the game
down to solvable nodes that allow us to
kind of piece the puzzle together and
come up with a a relatively
um General complex ish strategy right
we were kind of doing the opposite back
then we were
we were generalizing the game in a way
that allowed us to have
headlights on a dark road if you will
right like we we didn't have answers we
had zero answers but we felt like we had
enough of a head start because we were
operating with a light where the other
person was in the dark
and that was kind of just enough
yeah and that strategy actually that you
talked with actually is still something
that I personally apply uh today when
you're sitting at a I don't know Apex
Table Six Pack table whatever or at
least you know when there's multiple
players your money doesn't come from
Andrew Robo in that game right so
playing a strategy that allows you to
play more hands versus the players that
are not Andrew Robo is probably heavily
incentivized a lot of hands would
perform better as Flats than three bets
because you don't want to isolate
yourself against entry Robo that's not
the idea of this game right uh there's
one guy who's gonna four bet hands that
are not Kings and Aces and it's him so
why deal with that problem exactly so
and I think you initially uh mentioned
that as well that there was there's a
lot of benefits of growing up in that
age I don't actually know when you think
I started poker I think you labeled me
more as like a new school player but
actually play also already played poke
for 12 years so I've already started to
pre pre-solve or hs1 I definitely think
there are some benefits what do you
think are then those benefits that you
mentioned I think it was in the
beginning of the podcast that you
touched on that new players they they
ignore
uh yeah I mean uh maybe none for online
to be quite honest uh I think you could
probably speak to it more than me uh I I
didn't realize you had been in the game
that long but um you having the the uh
context of what it was like playing
online pre-black Friday or sorry
pre-solver maybe you can you can address
that a little bit better but when it
comes to live it's the social element uh
it's so rare that I see a very well
studied online player uh come into the
live realm and just assimilate to the
environment well uh they stick out like
a sore thumb it's very very clear that
they're studied and what they often do
is
put uh the weakest players who are
losing the most on edge
um they either scare them away
altogether
or they they position them in a way
where uh they just default to risk
aversion right the last thing you want
to do is take a fun player and make him
go back into his risk-averse shell
um but for the online player that's
that's kind of like their happy place
right uh you you just want people who
are going to passively put money in that
you can collect and then uh you want to
be able to redline people to death
um
the irony is that like redlining to
death it definitely still exists live
but not it doesn't look the same you
know it it doesn't look like this I'm
going to start with a flop over bet on
Ace King five and if this guy gives me
any sort of like uh problems throughout
well I have a candidate that can just
run it
it doesn't really play out that way
right it's it's more so
uh it's a little bit more subtle than
that it's just stealing every single pot
that's not being fought for
um and doing so in creative ways and not
not to say that you can't do it in uh
straight Game Theory theoretical way but
it's just a little bit tougher because
everybody gets conditioned to the
repetition right if you're just
constantly quarter pot three quarter pot
three quarter pot three quarter pot
quarter pot three quarter pot they're
gonna get accustomed to knowing that
when they peel with a bad hand they're
going to face the record part on the
turn so they're gonna stop peeling with
hands that can't make something by the
turn they're gonna stop peeling with
that just three to a straight three to a
flush and they're gonna start check
raising it instead
right even the worst players in the game
will fall accidentally into that into
that deviation and it happens to be a
semi-correct one you know
um
but instead like if you just you hit
them with some curveballs here and there
right like instead of beating them to
death with like quarter pot three
quarter pot quarter pot three quarter
pot you just start throwing in like
top pair check backs every once in a
while you start throwing in like
flop over bets on board textures where
like you probably weren't going to face
enough defense anyway so like it's a
free roll to you like King three deuce
and you happen to have a back door hand
like seven six like whatever
pot and a quarter and then table it
something along those lines like very
subtle annoying little things that just
like kind of work their way into the
psyche of players who are less studied
than you uh that stuff's not
intimidating to Rex that's engaging to
them they want to engage in the banter
they want to fight they want to find a
foe and they want it to be a friendly
foe who they feel like is on even
playing field with them as far as the
tools they're operating with when you
come in with that Precision like you're
a surgeon just ready to chop them up it
makes me uneasy and I know what you're
doing you know it's like I'm seeing the
whole thing unfold and I'm just like ah
like I'm shuddering at the fact of
knowing that like the 200 is coming in
on the next street it's like oh yeah
this is this is gonna get ugly fast and
and what happens is the game Flow just
dies because you're not playing that
many I shouldn't say you like projecting
out the view but uh that that person
isn't playing that many hands but the
second they enter one it's just like the
air sucked out of the room you know it's
like [ __ ] me man we're gonna play
stockfish right now like
come on guy give me a break it's about
half pot one time
for old time's sake
it's funny how you uh I I heard again
like the exploited first is like a bit
more GTO mindset come back where you
said you tried it if people are not
interested in the pot AK you know they
showed weakness that's when you attack
whereas I think you mentioned like the
overbat on the Ace King X that's more
aggression driven by the fact that you
have a certain range Advantage uh and
it's very focused on your range again
whereas the exploited player is way more
focused on what are their ranges and as
soon as you see weakness that's when you
attack right yeah that was an
interesting point uh that that we saw
the difference in terms of GTO approach
for a more explosive approach so the tip
for Live players who come to play online
you know we we know for online players
who come to play live we want the games
to be good we got the games to last long
uh main tip is
don't yeah what what's kind of the main
tip it's like I have to over bet seven
six on King three dudes you know my no
no
you don't you don't you don't have to do
anything but like yeah just do things
that uh you know may feel like you're
giving a little bit up like give
something back even so even even to the
Rex like obviously I we had uh we had a
podcast with uh Joe viral I don't know
if you know him yeah Gilbert and he and
he said the biggest mistake is that they
think in the micro the online players
they think about is what you said right
I think in a certain note they want to
play that note optimal but they don't
look at it in the long term said you
have to look it in the macro you are
there to entertain the recreational
player that's your main purpose they
could have went to the cinema they could
have went to dinner no they decided to
show up at the poker table and it's your
job to entertain them so don't go sit
there with your GTO strategy and tank
okay they are there to have fun and you
you are the Entertainer you have to make
sure that they have fun
yeah that's that's very good advice and
It's Tricky it's not as simple as just
like play a hand a certain way or you
know act a certain way or be affable or
whatever like of course all those things
come into it but
the biggest struggle I think is that
people who spend the majority of their
time starting a computer screen getting
very good at a game just aren't that
socially
adaptable and they miss a lot of cues
that would greatly benefit them you know
it to some degree you almost want to
treat it like you're on a date like a
first date of sorts and uh you know your
goal is not to
again your goal is not yeah it's not
necessary with them but it's more
importantly to make sure that they don't
storm off
okay right like you you wanna you wanna
go in for the kill you wanna you wanna
build a long-term relationship where you
know
okay you want to work this up to a good
night kiss like uh and and you you'll
have some pitfalls along the way where
you're sweating it you're like I don't
know if this is going my way right now
you know like that's a that's a good
witty banter back and forth kind of kind
of exchange right like but if you just
go in there with all the confidence in
the world like
I'm bagging this chick tonight you know
that kind of thing then uh they feel
that like they they recognize that you
see them as a mark
and nobody wants to feel that way like
obviously for the recreational players I
I understand that I agree but even
towards the other racks I mean the game
will will run regardless right it's it's
the shipwrecks that keep the game alive
okay so the [ __ ] that's important to
remember okay so if with the [ __ ] wrecks
we should try to go in for the kiss but
not but not try to get it yeah great
great advice
you did Elisha mention that you know at
a later at a later point in your career
obviously you were trying to get more
studied and you already mentioned like
the conflict between the experience that
you have as a player and then the study
voice coming in like yeah but you know
three I think you said three quarters
but he he gives a different meaning to
that than what the solver does
um
I assume that being a bit more studied
or studying the game uh with for example
solvers did benefit you what was like
the main aha moment for you when you
dived a bit more into theory if there
was or I think I think you also
mentioned uh maybe also because you're
closer Nick maybe also with studying
data so maybe both with data and solvers
but there were like some aha moments for
you when you started to study in that
way
I think
I don't know if there's one singular aha
moment but I think that
um it was the ability to contextualize a
lot of the theoretical principles and
align it with math
um so you know it's easy to understand
uh what Equity threshold is when it
comes to like the Pod odds model right
it's like okay well we need a certain
amount of equity but we throw that
around so loosely as if we just
understand how much Equity a hand has
and uh the truth of the matter is up
until you know maybe six or seven years
ago the only way we had any concept of
what amount of equity a hand had was if
it was a drawing hand you know we could
estimate uh how often we were going to
make our flush if we had the ace high
flush draw that type of thing
um but beyond that we we didn't really
understand and that was very apparent in
the way that we continued versus C bets
it was also very apparent in the way
that we see bet uh we devalued
drastically
pairs that were not top pair we devalued
drastically
draws to the nuts that had other hidden
value like overcards we devalued
drastically backdoor cards that you know
could potentially be utilized in Bluff
lines so I think for me
the the big
the big Discovery was
um kind of validating
actions that I was taking
by being demonstrated the math of why it
worked right so like me being able to
look at big bet lines
and recognizing that
um they're supposed to call with like
bottom pair
in this scenario because of you know
blockers and removal and all these other
things and like what the [ __ ] can I even
have type of stuff uh and realizing like
oh
they're folding top pair versus this bet
like we're we're out here killing it
right because it's like I don't need to
actually see the math behind that to
know how much money I'm making
I just know that if like they're
supposed to be mostly calling with
bottom pair in a spot that I think
they're mostly folding top pair we've
just hit the jackpot and it allowed me
to retroactively look back and say like
okay this is how we made money
for 10 years for 15 years whatever the
case may be and this is how it's going
to Trend and change people are not going
to continue to fold bottom pair they're
not going to get they're definitely not
going to continue to fold top pair right
so the over 40 era is coming to a close
and what's the next adjustment that we
can anticipate and you know for a while
it was let's study into what happens
when people over correct and you know
float too widely
um versus small bets and when I say too
widely I don't necessarily mean in
accordance to MDF but more so in
accordance to uh the proper strategy as
far as like how are they going to
balance themselves on the turn when they
just never fold to a c bet type of stuff
and that served me really well so like
I'm always just trying to apply the
scientific method when it comes to my
solver work I don't really get too
granular because I'm not playing online
so I don't need to play small blind
versus big blind perfectly right I just
need to have a rough understanding of
what the ranges are and
how to construct whenever I move into
certain board textures what I'm much
more concerned about is just like taking
a hypothesis and saying like Okay if I
think the environment is trending this
way because it's very much monkey see
monkey do then
what in theory land
would be the natural adjustment to this
and how can we Note Block to kind of
test
this sounds very similar to a podcast
that we did with Yuri padlock who didn't
necessarily learn his strategy through
the sofa but it's more when he started
to study sofas he was like Hey people
don't do this how can I exploit even
further so basically you know uh he
became a better exploitive player
because of it also because of his
mindset is that everyone is official
everyone should be treated from an
exploitative lens that was one uh when
and if so now if so and when did then
data come in I know you're you're
friends with Nick who's the I guess
labeled data guy yeah and how does that
translate to the live scene
uh uh okay well I won't put the card for
the horse uh Nick is one of my favorite
people that I've come across in if for
no other way than the way that I think
we challenge one another
um so we first met pretty randomly uh he
was in Vegas and I was reading like his
blog on run at once and this must have
been like 2016. it was it was right as
Pokey and movement so to speak of uh
really selling GTO to the to the
marketplace was was coming to be and it
all just felt so bullshitty to me uh and
even now like looking back on it the
idea of of like us putting this label to
something that's been in existence since
Von Von Neumann right like game theory
is just a thing it's a it's a study of
games within the mathematical construct
and we somehow tried to make it this
cool edgy thing with this label of GTO
right like
are you even GTO bro like how the [ __ ]
did we end up down this path but because
of Joe Ingram I think right yeah
yeah they marketed well
um but it was [ __ ] because like what
what we were selling back then was
nonsense and we all know that now with
hindsight and you know the things that
we're studying now are getting us a
little bit closer but in five years
they're gonna look like [ __ ] too
we're gonna laugh at how terrible we
were in 2022.
um but I just remember Nick like kind of
speaking out against that movement and
coming from a place of like look
I swallowed the red pill I dove as deep
into theoretical studies you can
possibly go I did all the solver work
and I'm here to tell you that it's it's
not the way and I was just like okay
this is interesting to me because I also
feel like
in current game state of 2016 it's not
the way
um but I haven't done all this work so
I'd like to I'd like to talk to this guy
so we started chatting uh we ended up
meeting up in Vegas and hanging out
quite a bit and our are like Global
thoughts or our general thoughts really
alike like we truly seem to see strategy
very very very similarly from a broad
perspective the difference was he was
very calibrated in the micro For Better
or For Worse and on top of that he had
just gotten into doing a ton of data
study where he was pulling MDA uh or he
was doing MDA on like a lot of these
pools online
and uh
I was all ears because
all of that calibration was then being
basically distilled down into
generalizations right against the fish
you do X against a reg you do y and you
know poker becomes kind of easy again
it's like okay that's fascinating we
would talk about it in very general
terms and I could find ways that it was
applicable to live
as he got deeper into the MDA and detox
really kind of started to blow up uh and
now you know theoretical study was kind
of getting a little bit more precise and
I was getting my feet wet and starting
to learn a lot more
um
he would tell me a lot of the
discoveries that they were making and
they all made perfect sense to me but
where we would lose each other was the
qualifications because he was very
certain as someone who played very
little live at the time that all of his
Mass data analysis would translate one
to one from live to online
and I remember we made a trip to Big
Bear where we were there for like a week
and this argument lasted pretty much the
entire week where I was just like
hell-bent on
a fish online is not the same as a fish
live like it's not even remotely close
the same way that steaks don't translate
through the tube Realms like 10 20
online is like the equivalent of 100 200
lives you know and what you're labeling
as a fish
like because he would basically be like
yeah fish online like over Bluff River
by 23 or something like that I'm just
like well not my [ __ ] game buddy like
never is that riverbed a bluff like they
just they literally never Bluff like
it's quite the opposite uh and we were
just like fighting tooth or nail and I
think it was just kind of a lack or a
miscommunication because we were using
the same general terms to describe
something wildly different uh and you
know if you look at like the HUD stats
around how each of the the profiles are
labeled and you try to guess what the
HUD stats are in the live realm you'd
very quickly recognize that like what he
has labeled as a fish online is probably
like a weak regular
in a live environment like a guy that
you would expect to be winning like I
don't know one or two maybe three or
four big blinds per hour somewhere
between like small winner and small
loser right and it's like this is your
fish online this is the guy who's
probably like losing three or four big
lines per hundred and I'm like oh man
let me introduce you to a real fish
because like not not to throw one of the
bus but like we'd be having this
argument I'd be like I would just
constantly bring it back I'd be like you
think Bob Wright's betting River there
with with the nothing you think that
he's showing up there with the
absolutely nothing way too often like no
[ __ ] chance man it's the nuts every
single time because he didn't show up
there to get his braids kicked in with a
bluff like he showed up there to get
paid with a good hand and that's that's
the mindset of live recreationals you
know they don't understand the game from
a a strategy standpoint they understand
it from a risk standpoint and we hate
asymmetrical risk we just hate it as
human beings like it feels so unnatural
like that's why poker players are so
unique I know so many people who were
just like all in on the Floyd Mayweather
fight three or four years ago saying it
was the biggest
deal of Eevee they've ever had they were
laying like eight to one like massive
massive Price Right like laying 8 000 to
win one thousand but all of them were
just like this is the freest money we've
ever earned right that asymmetrical risk
makes people very [ __ ] uncomfortable
the election uh a few years ago same
thing everybody's piling in like freeze
money in the world well you know there
were points where
you were laying a hefty price going one
way or the other like to bet against
Trump uh but you know that's that's the
difference that's why they're Killers
because it doesn't matter if the risk is
asymmetrical all that matters is the EV
surrounding it recreationals don't think
that way man like uh I was just reading
a book
um it was about Danny Kahneman and his
partner Amos uh that that they grew up
uh I can't recall the name of the book
but Michael Lewis wrote it but anyway
they were talking about
um one of the the projects that they had
studied throughout was uh measuring risk
and the proposition they would give to a
controlled group was
um if we flip the coin
uh and you choose correctly I'll give
you a hundred dollars but uh if you
choose incorrectly you give me a hundred
dollars so it's a zero EV proposition
they're like no absolutely not like
almost everybody across the board said
no and they said okay
um if I flip a coin and I give you 200
if you guess correctly but you give me a
hundred dollars if you guess incorrectly
uh would you take that proposition and
the number only shift slightly it was
like 10 more people would take the
proposition getting laid two to one on a
coin flip right wow uh and the greater
than the greater the monetary risk the
bigger the odds they wanted to see so if
they just change the number from 100 to
1000 that number would drop again
right because we're just so risk-averse
as people all we can think about
internally is like the worst case
scenario uh conversely they ran another
study where uh they said
um
I want to make sure I get the details of
this right but basically they offer two
zero EV propositions one was
um oh it was uh it was something to the
effect of like uh I'll give you a
hundred dollars right now or we could
flip a coin and if you guess correctly
you get two hundred dollars right so
it's a it's a hundred hundred dollar EV
proposition almost everybody just took
the hundred bucks to guaranteed hundred
bucks when they inversed it and said you
can pay me a hundred dollars to not flip
this coin or
uh we can flip this coin and if you
guess correctly you owe me nothing if
you guess incorrectly you owe me 200.
almost everybody flipped the coin
so we have this weird relationship with
risk where we want to latch on to what
we have so desperately we want to
protect what we have so desperately that
uh we'll do anything to not to not put
it uh In Harm's Way but the second that
it's taken away from us anyway we are
super risky we'll do anything to get it
back right like if you're stuck for
example correct perfect perfect example
it's like think of the mindset the the
difference between how fast you want to
rack up whenever you're winning
especially like a big number like an
amount that feels like it's too much
almost right like oh man I'm up eight
buy-ins in three hours I'm getting the
[ __ ] out of here like what am I gonna do
win 10. this is crazy I'm gone
but you're stuck or you're stuck eight
binds and all of a sudden you have your
car keys on the table your bankroll [ __ ]
it yeah music anyway so right what am I
gonna do lose 20 I'm getting even
tonight baby one way or another like you
don't even think about the fact that
it's hard to win eight binds back you're
just like I'm I'm here like I'm
obviously buried because somebody in
this game stinks and it's not me as
opposed to when you're winning you know
you're like oh I'm winning because I'm
like running really hot or I'm getting
lucky like you don't think to yourself
like this is the best game I've ever
played in type of stuff so
um yeah we have this like very very
strange relationship with risk and uh
that was like the big thing that I
struggled to communicate with Nick
um because that's a huge separator
between online and live not just
the tier system of like you know the
worst player online is still better than
30 of the the players live but secondary
to that the anonymity of it all right
like the fact that they just get the
click buttons and if they lose like
their account reloads or they go broke
and they disappear and nobody ever you
know whatever Joe star 555 disappeared
big deal who gives a [ __ ] right once
you're there and you have to physically
hand the cash over after running a bluff
that failed that you had the table and
show to everybody around so that they
could point and laugh and now you have
to pick up and put your hands in your
pocket and slink off knowing that you're
gonna see these people again tomorrow
that'll stop a man from from putting his
money in bad very quickly yeah so
there's an extra it's a bit harder to
Bluff in the Life environment because of
all these things that come around it but
I guess in terms of folding I'm pretty
sure that Nick agrees right the people
are risk first and therefore they tend
to overfold that's kind of I think also
part of his philosophy and I think it
also really uh I think it's harder if
you play live because you're actually
facing a person right it's harder to see
a person as a profile or online you know
you just label people and you have
multiple tables so you just spot like ah
ragfish blah blah blah whereas like you
said life you play against Joe not the
Joe star 5555 right so there's it's it's
a bit different I think it's a bit
harder to think of him as just another
guy in the Alias right
yeah also like people have moods you
know yeah but like exactly but you can
actually see the mood online correct
correct also you know they also have
mutso in the long term the data you know
is is correct it also takes a moves into
consideration but it's a bit less
obvious when they're in that mood right
well yeah it's it's of course over the
the the grander scope of it the data
takes all that into consideration but
imagine if you could just hone in on
those little clusters where you know
that they're in a certain mood right
imagine how skewed that data actually
looks in those uh zoomed in clusters for
sure but then it comes back to indeed
again your approach of more exploitable
because you have more information and
you have more time to take that
information in consideration whereas
online if you play multiple tables you
don't have that information defaulting
to a data strategy it's probably better
than to guess so to speak right honestly
it it almost feels unfair
um I go back and forth to this I've
never really taken a hard stance uh Nick
and I have had this debate a few times
but uh I'm very much wishy-washy on what
I think the ethics of even uh
uh doing Mass data analysis are uh and I
don't ever take issue with Nick because
it's like it's out there right like
you'd be a fool not like you're
basically lazy if you're not doing it
um but I I remember like the the one day
that I really paused for concern where I
was just like what the [ __ ] is happening
and it made me realize like this is just
happening at scale uh was when upswing
put out a course called like beat OTB
Red Baron or something like that yeah
and later also with liners right yeah
and it's just like
I I understand these hands are out there
and people are already doing this
analysis but it re it immediately took
me back to the Hastings Townsend isildur
uh situation where like isildura
basically just got absolutely demolished
and he was an enigma like he was
somebody that was not being figured out
unless you paid the cost to put in the
hands versus him you know suddenly like
he gets data mined and they're able to
just curate a perfect strategy or at
least a a more optimal one than people
are able to do on the Fly and
he's [ __ ] out of luck and fresh out of a
few million
yeah I think I think there's a
difference between analyzing a poo and
analyzing a specific player I think
obviously from a commercial perspective
I understand it but let's say I would I
mean actually I have a coaching company
but I would never like even though I
know it's good for commercial I'm not
gonna put linuses game out there or OTP
is game out there I think that's very
much not done I even heard that uh I
think it was the Spanish guy right it
was the eduka course in which they
analyzed OTB and they both they were
actually both living in London and educa
called OTB like a day before it would
launch okay let's meet up and he said oh
uh tomorrow of course it's gonna launch
an upswing in which I analyze your
complete game that's wild it's just like
a day before yeah like yeah I know this
is not okay but you know I did it right
away right it's like it's so tough for
me to even like conceptually understand
because
it's not opinion anymore right like if I
did that in 2012 or Phil gelfon did that
whenever he started run at once like
okay so you're gonna hear Phil's opinion
on one of his opponents and he's going
to use some examples and like that's
that's powerful right there's knowledge
there for sure but it's so insignificant
grand scheme of things you're gonna just
show me a hundred thousand hands that
line is played and we're gonna sort for
the most interesting ones and you know
lines that uh are pretty obscure and
[ __ ] like that's like Jesus like
what chance does he have I mean like he
has to adapt literally faster than every
single other person who's playing that's
that's so shitty
can't have nice things I I think I think
that's kind of where where the line
should be drawn and I know a player it's
also
like in in my in my opinion or how I
always approach everything in poker
this I don't know if this is good or bad
but I never really stopped and think
about what I think of something
ethically it's more that as long as it's
allowed and people use it to gain an
edge I'm sort of forced to use it anyway
to get an edge whatever I think of it
like when seeding scripts were hot yeah
people would ask me for my opinion and I
honestly I said listen I didn't even
stop to think about my opinion everyone
was using it I couldn't get into games
anymore so my job was to get a faster
script than the rest yeah you know it
when they laid a Bandits you know I have
to say when you get used to playing
online with scripts you don't want to go
back but then when they bend it you know
at least no one had a script anymore
right then then it's fine with me as
well right as long as the playing field
is level I think that's what is most
important yeah I think that's a a a very
smart way to go about it keeps you sane
uh I I tend not to but I also don't play
online so I don't I don't like it
I don't have to deal with these moral
quandries all that often right like I do
it more so from the outside looking in
so I get to be a lot more objective
about it
yeah and it's also I mean obviously when
you use it yourself and get the benefits
like I said with seating scripts even if
you don't like it like I said it's so
nice I really I really miss City scripts
to be honest it's not good for it's not
for the game but from my personal
experience the playing experience I mean
imagine you know you were just taking a
break and then it's on the Earth
and it's like you were sitting next to a
whale right
yeah that perspective like obviously
like when I hear this there's
immediately two sides of it the
professional that things in terms of
optimization thinks wow this is awesome
but obviously I also think like okay
this is clearly not good for the game uh
yeah yeah so yeah that's that's clearly
two signs of it in terms of close of
data I think uh
for example Nick when Nick said oh
they're bluffing 23 here think that's a
bit too Global right and then you nailed
into a specific profile do you think he
Bluffs or is it this specific line uh
then what they what often is used as
well then they go very specific with
data they say oh a bad bad in this
formation on this texture is Bluff 28
and you try to memorize all the data I'm
not a big fan of that approach either I
usually what I do with data is I try to
take a bit more of a global view and try
to understand like okay why does a
certain leak occur what's kind of the
psychology behind it and usually if you
put the data next to a solver usually
you can kind of see why they screw up
Theory and why a leak occurs and I think
these Concepts like errors and range
construction for example that lead to an
overflow under blood spot over full spot
under full spot if you then consult the
solver and put it next to the data
usually you can understand that and if
you take that knowledge life it will
probably still remain the exact
percentage might be different but that's
not what I personally personally focus
on I just focus on okay this spot is
likely to be overblocked or likely to be
under bluffed and then from there you
know if you play Live indeed there's
maybe a bit more specific profiles that
you can take in consideration
um
Adam you ever played live poker I mean
heads up high percent goes not really a
live format the casino is not really
going to make a lot of money on that
no I was kind of handcuffed in two
variables one playing 25 big blinds
heads of Poker two living in Bali Asia
with no Casino illegal gambling so not
much live experience so to speak
um so yeah company comments on anything
live yeah I think it's very interesting
what you guys were saying like where to
draw like an ethical line it does seem
like we're in kind of programs are
coming out on one individual it just
seems quite unfair that everybody has an
edge on that one person seems like most
people can agree like that's kind of not
the right practice if it's kind of
universe like a hood for example
everyone can use a hood obviously
professionals use them more than right
recreationals at the same time everyone
has the option to get that kind of
Advantage so yeah it's an interesting
kind of moral dilemma something you face
and yeah it was the same as you ran in
like sometimes like you just went with
the floor like I had 16 square feet it
was Sharky Sharky straight there I
actually moved from Bali to uh Portugal
to get a fast internet connection
because my seats grip wasn't quick
enough in Asia but it's basically do
that or don't get games like it was kind
of black and white so just follow along
you don't think like should we be doing
this is this the normal thing like is
this the way it was so yeah I can can
relate to that yeah I remember like
people would even move or a higher like
remote desktop and put servers next to
[ __ ] ISO of men so that would be the
closest to the poker server as possible
that suddenly became a way to gain an
edge it had no longer to do with who was
the technical player it was like are you
fasting are you closest to the surface
in isil of men to get to the game that
was that was kind of the criteria of
being a very good winner
very true yeah there was two guys in my
game one was um living in Isle of Man
and one was in Belarus and we basically
all went for the same kind of lobby as
they kind of fish came through and
basically the fastest like fastest
connection first and this guy from
Belarus and this guy from Isle of Man
we're getting like four games five ones
one game she was like what the hell
what's going on and all the time like
they kind of standardized like the kind
of queuing system so everyone's got in
line but yeah there were some wild times
where it's like things was going a bit
crazy and bigger in the Isle of Man was
all of a sudden the kind of the Jesus
and sit on the on the whale so to speak
but um yeah for funny times see everyone
asking a few questions down are we going
towards the three hour mark which is
quite long but yeah I wanted to ask to
make a reflection questions you've had a
very long career so I want to go back to
uh what's the most important lessons
that podcast taught you it's the last 20
years is any important life lessons that
you play through a podcast
um yes for sure is the short answer uh
uh I truly believe
and it's unfortunate that this doesn't
scale because I think that the world
would be served better if everybody
endured
some level of competitive poker at some
point in their life because I truly
believe that it's like a one-to-one
comparison to life itself and I don't
mean necessarily in
uh in like the the specifics of the
detail of the game versus like life
being played like a game or anything
like that but I mean more so in the
vastness of the variables and how they
shake out in accordance to both variants
and strategy uh I don't think it's an
accident that you see things like
liberatis being utilized as a war games
tool now after having been uh uh
originally designed to be a heads up bot
to beat the likes of Polk and others
right
um the reason why that conversion
happened so so easily is because
the game itself is so so dynamic in
nature right there are just so many
endless variables that we can't possibly
account for uh that we're often just
forced to train ourselves to think
probabilistically and deal with the most
rational spectrum of outcomes that could
potentially occur and everyone would be
better served in life to be able to not
only take on that sort of mindset on a
day-to-day basis but be actually able to
apply it right uh it's one thing to
recognize that probabilities exist and
that variants exist and to acknowledge
that kind of stuff it's a whole other
to be able to identify that
where we like to impart control
variance is actually the large Factor
that's that's kind of taking the reins
yeah that's a huge one like polka trans
you think probabilities on everyday life
you call it nothing in terms of a trait
of various options that could play out
and there's no 100 of anything there's
always like a way to end but people who
don't play poker haven't had that kind
of probability training generally think
black and white it's like oh this is
going to happen that's not going to
happen and then they use confirmation
bias to confirm the 100 likelihood of an
event where you're like that was
probably variant so it was a higher
weight Insight yeah I think it's one of
those things where poker really really
trains that skill like every single day
you think in AV in terms of
probabilities variance just punches you
in the face beats you senseless until
you get it and you're like oh this is
very it's known unless the varies oh
this is variance no no that's the
variance you've just got over and over
learn the lessons in yeah I think it's a
very yeah I like that kind of one-to-one
experience and also think another
aligned with that it lends you to deal
with emotions alongside that because
when you don't get your own way or
probabilities play against you the
amount of turmoil that creates when
you're almost losing control and things
are going against you but you'll think
you're trying to do everything right and
just releasing that control and
obviously trying to release the control
and all the conflicts that come up
emotionally because I have so many
conversations with poker players who are
still in that kind of transition periods
and they're just learning to deal with
like the emotional turmoil of being a
poker player and I'm always telling this
is the best thing like this is like one
of the best lessons of life like figure
it out in the public context you'll go
into the rest of your life and
everything's gonna be a breeze because
you've learned in a very volatile
hostile environment how to deal with
emotion how to deal with all the
insecurities that come with yeah not
know what's going to happen in technical
Baron so yeah really really good lesson
next question I want to ask you is about
beliefs for you you've climbed all the
stakes the highest Stakes possible what
do you think are some of the beliefs
that you've had to let go of I always
feel like when we're progressing in life
we're having the shedly as of ourselves
and very often we critically limits for
ourselves we can't get past it and very
often we can't see it until like in
reflection is there any kind of beliefs
or assumptions that you had about poker
or about life that you had to let go of
in all order to progress further
yeah I actually think uh a couple of
them we we kicked this podcast off with
uh I think the belief that
uh
uh growth within this space is linear
and that uh it is a bit of a meritocracy
where working equals uh success out uh
very slowly but surely uh I recognize
that those two things are at most
partially true
um a matter of fact the linear growth
aspect of this game is probably all but
dead uh we see that as the steps through
the ranks kind of start to disappear
um it's it's looking a lot more like the
daily fantasy sports landscape where the
best in the world may be playing
everything from a 100K buy-in all the
way down to a 1K buy-in right
um we're just forced to chase EV there
just isn't enough money to go around for
everybody there's not enough bottom line
so if you're really good at your craft
you just do things to earn money so uh
I've lost the dream so to speak uh and
in some regards according to my younger
self I achieved the dream as well like
being able to actually uh move through
the ranks but the reality is I I didn't
even do that linearly it's not like I
went from
10 200 200 to 200 400 and then up the
ranks right it was like one day I'm
playing 10 20 and the next day I'm
playing 300 600 1200 it's like that's
not real that's that's that's hardly a
linear progression you know that's
that's just a a leap and a prey that you
land amongst the feathers but
um yeah that and uh the meritocracy
aspect uh the the desire to be like the
best in the world all these things that
we like to paint with a black and white
brush they don't exist you know they
don't mean anything they're just ego uh
it's it's very hard to reduce this game
down to a means to an end where your
sole purpose is to
be talented enough to earn a living
uh but that that's in reality what we're
doing
you shouldn't really you know I don't
care what my peers think I used to care
a lot I I couldn't care less now
yeah yeah I think that's the thing like
as a poker player we we want the linear
Pursuit I think a lot of online players
in particular see poker is this kind of
just level by level game just get good
get the strategy dial and get my
bankroll in the good place the next
level beat that game say computer game
you progress from one level to the next
so my question I want to ask you is how
do you make leaps like you made that
leap when you had that situation where
you got to play it in the Ivy's room
game but what allows you to make a leap
because it leap's always scary right
like the stomach there's something safe
about taking like a little next step for
myself for example playing heads up
sitting goals I spent a lot of time at
one buy-in got a good win rate and then
I shot took the next bar in just above
just outside my comfort zone so I could
stretch a little bit to jump two buy-ins
would have been like whoa that's a leap
I'm not doing that even if someone like
put me in that game I'd be like I don't
know this is am I ready for this but you
took a lot of leaps during your career
so um first of all what allows someone
to take a leap like pocket player wants
to make a progression or an opportunity
arises what what allows you to take
those opportunities as they come yeah I
mean I think first it really is just the
sheer luck of having the opportunity to
follow your way
um and that's why so many of us that are
still around are byproduct of
survivorship bias it's like we were just
right place right time kind of thing
um but the actual execution and and
having the faith to do it it's for me it
was always a a framework of like well
what's the alternative
right like looking at the downside
rather than the downside of passing on
the leap rather than the downside of
taking the leap and failing
um because to me nothing would be more
discouraging and nothing would drive me
out of this space faster than to be
complacent and I feel it now right like
getting to a level where you're
accustomed to playing high stakes and
suddenly like games begin to dry up or
you don't have invites or you know you
just can't really play as often as you
would like
that that layer of complacency starts to
to kind of come over you where it's just
like what am I I'm not pursuing anything
anymore there's nothing higher to chase
uh I don't want to shift
focuses and become like a part of the
High Roller MCT scene like that's not my
skill set everything we've talked about
here today like I'm the antithesis of
what it takes to be successful at High
Roller mtds uh so
it becomes very challenging to stay
motivated uh when there is no further
Pursuit and I think that was always my
framework it was always just a race to
um ensure that the next step that I was
taking was creating an a new floor right
it's never about achieving a ceiling
it's just about elevating the floor to
the point where you can't fail any
longer
I love that I love the flow and see the
analogy where we've always got a limit
which is generally the ceiling that we
create for ourselves and the floor that
we're kind of stepping on and we can
just keep moving between those kind of
boundaries and very often there's
limitations that we create for ourselves
our own self-constructs and yeah I found
it interesting that you uh you found it
less risky to take a risk and fail like
take a leap and fail rather than not
taking a risk that complacency is more
scary for you which I think is not the
common kind of way of thinking I think
most people to think about taking a risk
and feeling like you talked before like
risk aversion being like a real thing to
think about putting yourself on the line
whether it's financially whether it's
with efforts whether it's with your time
and energy and then coming up short for
a lot of people that's that's worse than
going on I just didn't try I just didn't
quite I could have done it but I still
put all my own time into it so uh for
you you've got that kind of growth
mindset where you uh you need to do
those leaps you need to be on to the
next thing because if not you're like
why am I doing this why if I'm not
growing not evolving not finding my next
thing to pursue what is this all about
so for you it's this pursuit of better
which probably comes from your your
baseball days your pursuit of of growth
and getting better what you're doing and
yeah obviously that's steady
yeah I I struggle a lot to uh relate to
people that that fall into a good place
to see uh Brian one of my closest
friends I was telling you about earlier
um I remember us having a conversation
where
uh you know I was previously backing him
he went broke through the process I went
broke through the process and like he
fell all the way from playing like 10 20
down to like two dollar five dollars
something like that and uh he took on a
new backer after me to play 2-5 which is
nearly nothing and was doing well he
made like 80 000 in a year he got to
keep half and was so proud of himself I
remember us having a conversation him
saying like I never want to play bigger
than two five again and I looked at him
right in that moment I said your career
is over and he was so upset because like
he had just had one of the best years
that he could imagine and everything
else I was just like that's it man like
this is the beginning of the end and
sure enough like within a couple years
he was completely completely out of the
game
um and for me it's just like
maybe it's because I've always been a
little bit older than my peers whenever
it comes to this game like I was 21 when
the money maker boom came to be so I
wasn't up I wasn't really a part of that
wave right behind me of 16 to 18 year
olds that were you know stealing their
parents credit card to jump on party
poker and become the next Mike McDonald
uh or the actual Mike McDonald I suppose
uh
so like I was always maybe a year or two
ahead and I I could always just like
look around and maybe it's also a
byproduct of like where I grew up I knew
what it was like to look at deadbeats
and townies and guys who never got out
so there was always that bit of fear of
this can't be it you know like uh the
idea of not taking the risk and just
staying as is you better be really
[ __ ] high up on the totem pole to
want to stay as is because like if you
think beating 510 for 200 bucks an hour
is the end I'll be all like there are
jobs that will pay better than that and
that was always my big thing is like if
I'm gonna be in this space I either need
to be making more
uh doing what I'm doing then I could
make in a traditional career or I need
to be making a
more with fewer exchanged hours right so
uh you know I'm kind of like Waco a bit
in the sense that like I never really
computed hourly but it was more about
annually right like what can I make
annually doing what I'm doing and if I
could make a doctor's salary or a
doctor's salary and then some knowing
that I only worked 600 800 1000 hours
it's just like well I don't know what
that computes to and I don't care
because like that's the freedom that I'm
looking for yeah yeah a few things come
there once they kind of grow a die
mentality like there's no plateau in
like you said to your friend as soon as
you said I'm gonna stay here like no no
you're done you haven't got the passion
enthusiasm the Curiosity to keep going
and you also clear he was scared right
yeah he was just so afraid to go back up
that level and then get beat down and he
didn't want to start over again like
he's like I'm 32 now like I can't start
from scratch and he was right he
couldn't start from scratch like he was
literally just gonna play himself out
yeah it's a good one it's a good one
thing to see as well you probably didn't
want to hear it from you at the time but
it was a bit like Reflection from you to
go look like either you get that
Curiosity back you get that kind of risk
tolerance back or Pockets got a short
shelf life for you yeah I think for you
it seems that you've got that always
drawn always going forwards and you've
also got like you talk about that kind
of fear that thing's not working out
you've talked about this kind of
imposter syndrome which I think is very
interesting about successful people
they've often got a few attributes
together one is like a belief that they
can achieve things that other people
can't achieve they've got that generally
balance with a massive insecurity that
they're not good enough that they're
still what they've done isn't quite
ready yet then they can often delay
gratification longer than other people
to keep pursuing things through the pain
so you've got this kind of tables going
on where people around you think you've
got to figure it out but you're inside
like no no I ain't got this to get out I
need to keep going harder so it creates
this kind of constant yeah constantly
going but you're like when am I going to
figure this out I still feel like I'm
still in the kind of process so yeah I
think it's a these kind of conflict in
paradigms sometimes what drives you
forwards um yeah
I'm sure you've got some final questions
to ask and then we can let Mike go on
his way no no no I actually have no uh
no further questions uh I think uh you
know after the after the little
reflection on the poker career and
everything we already have discussed I
mean obviously you know we can continue
on this conversation for another couple
hours I I'm sure we can find a stuff to
talk about but uh as you always say Adam
to be respectful of uh berkey's time I
think it's a good moment to wrap it up
do you have any final things that you
would like to share Matt
before we close it off
uh no I I really enjoyed this uh I I
think I kind of mentioned this to you
but uh my first exposure to you was when
you were pre when you're streaming
pretty heavily uh you used to pull up a
clip from poker out loud or maybe a song
for poker out loud people were like
sending me these little Clips uh from
your stream or whatever and I never knew
what to make of it because I I didn't
always see it in the full context of uh
like the actual stream or whatever I'm
like I'm not sure if I'm getting meme
done or not but I also don't care like
I'm just so happy that because I thought
you were very good like the the bit I'd
watched uh I was like he's clearly good
he's winning I was just like I'm so
happy that somebody who's good is even
like spending any time on poker out loud
to the point where he would even
consider memeing I'm in I'm a fan
it was an epic of that hand that you
played against Nick I think that's where
I got all the clips from yeah I think
they were
uh
uh yeah it was something with the
induction sizing I used that one yeah
this seems to be an induction sizing
every time when someone put it I put a
deduction inside I will play that clip
it seems to be an induction size where I
think he thinks I would fall for this
with
one pair of type Holdings
um so all the clips were like selected I
think at some point I had like 50 Clips
they were all like made for a certain
moment you know that's perfect I love it
and then and then I remember it was Nick
explaining a hint where he used a lot of
words uh and then I would if I made a
call or something and I didn't want to
explain myself I would just play that
clip for the people of curious as to why
I made this call let me let me have Nick
explain it to you I love it because I'm
operating on an assumption that he's
very polarized in that spot which
combinatorically Narrows his value range
of ton and could create a bluffing
imbalance if he's not very careful but
you were spot on on that read right with
that hand yeah and what this allows you
to do is uh is uh is put a trigger with
the bottom of his range or something
like that right I mean the hand itself
like in hindsight is such nonsense but
for 2016 it just made so much sense like
I remember walking away from that
session going like I hadn't seen
anything yet and I just go to the
production crew I go man this idea we
had because of a season one I was like
this idea is genius I'm [ __ ] locked
in right now like I'm locked in and now
like I go back and watch the hands and
it's like so cringe like we were just
throwing [ __ ] against the wall but uh
yeah I mean
yeah it was really just we were just
navigating this the the psychological
Dynamic nothing else mattered
yeah but hey uh thank you uh
for for producing that content that made
a lot of good Clips people were very
happy to listen to it
I'm here for it
so any any final words besides that
no no big fan of what you guys do uh uh
I'm I've enjoyed this I it's not often I
get to have like long in-depth
conversations I appreciate that you guys
kept it uh less
drilling me kind of in more of a an open
conversation like uh it's nice to just
sit down with peers and kick it once in
a while
yeah we exactly we feel exactly the same
way we like the criteria is always that
we want to have a guest on that we're
generally interested in talking to so I
think because of that criteria usually
the conversations end up the way this
one was uh and that's also why like for
example we've been talked for three
hours and usually in people's experience
and in my experience as well it's like
oh wow it's already been three hours
yeah no it's like oh I had to point it
out I'm like Oh wait [ __ ] an hour pass
by but that's just because you know uh
we we try to keep it uh keep it a nice
conversation so I'm really happy you
enjoyed it and I want to thank you a lot
again for coming on anytime
all right I'm going to be repeating
myself here but what a great
conversation that was with Mr Berkey
Adam what were your main takeaways from
this episode
yeah great conversation really enjoyed
it so many lessons that we can learn
from from that first one I want to talk
about is dealing with adversity how many
obstacles they face throughout his
career I really love this story about
going Baroque like 10 years into his
career just picture playing for 10 years
then losing it all have to rebuild from
that his ability to deal with adversity
but also uh he did a lot of
introspective work to move forwards but
yeah the ability to use setbacks as a
learner tool to move forward I think
that's a very very good like lesson to
learn where nothing's final if you're
still in the game you're still
progressing but him one of the things he
did to Honda diversity he would simplify
his life and control certain variables
whatever his health it was exercise it
was things that he could hold on to
Junior University I know myself when
life's going hectic I like to control
the things I can in my life a lot more
to create some sort of anchor to hold on
to so I think that was a real important
one next one was taking opportunities he
had many chances to uh play like safe
but he ended up in Ivy's room playing
some superhero like games because he
took a leap he took a leap of faith yes
he had people around him yes opportunity
kind of made its way to him but at the
same time he had some balls to take
these opportunities when they came and
find a way to make it work and sometimes
I think I like like an opportunity
arises and you've got to be brave and
I'll just go up yep I'll figure it out I
think the one for Ivy's game he only had
a 200k roll you had to figure out how to
settle his action but he just went I
mean opportunity Rises I'm there so I
think that ability to uh go into risk
and then figure things out later is a
huge one perspective his ability to look
back on situations and to put everything
in context I think he's done a good job
of his career obviously I basically
reflecting on how everything's played
out he also talked about like this the
um look at the bigger picture of his
games he was like brave enough to go
like his own path and do different
strategies you know in the current age
that's harder because solvers kind of
guide the way but he talked about like
having a limping strategy where no one
else has limping and all the regs are
calling him stupid but he was just
crushing the games because he'd be able
to see the bigger picture and he was
able to give up the strategy that could
yeah beats that be their eggs and you do
some unorthodox in order to profit so I
think yeah very good at like
understanding the kind of big picture
you also talked about being almost I
think maybe in the facilitate of the
money like all the money passing through
him in these kind of live games and him
being very strategic and like very
long-term thinking where he was almost
given money back to the to the rights or
to the fair show to certain people
because he got so much in control of
like long term if I continue to make it
a good player experience if everyone
else I'll be a big winner so I think
that's kind of big picture I think again
where often if we call the details
trying to maximize EV of every hand
every spot we can we can lose track of
that so uh yeah and then another one I
thought was really interesting is him
dealing with like the inner kind of
dialogue of almost like imposter
syndrome almost feeling like oh do I
belong here am I going to find out fears
have been all going wrong I think it's a
very common feeling that we as we're
trying to achieve things we arrived
somewhere we go do I belong here and
there's also a fear of what this has
taken away I think living with that's
kind of in the background is is actually
buying it's actually a good thing
because it keeps us on our tours and
also lets us have gratitude for where we
are great this could this may not last
this may get taken away I'm doing all I
can to belong here to have success but I
don't know what the future is going to
hold it's a lot of uncertainty so uh I'm
just going to accept that and accept
that what comes with it so yeah a lot of
lessons there such a I'll have to listen
back myself to get some more takeaways
but please I've read about what were the
main things that stick out for you
yeah it was uh the point that you
mentioned about the live game and again
looking at this more from a long term
perspective or as uh Joe viral talked
about remember from the macro and this
is also the reason why we try to get
people on that play different games or
different formats to get perspective so
both Joe Vaio and Matt Burkey mainly
played life and they gave a very macro
perspective towards approaching strategy
he was even talking about uh in terms of
realizing where your money comes from in
those games that is by uh giving action
that they like so he was even talking
about adjusting strategies not over
betting because that would scare them
away they don't like that and it's
exactly what you said he kind of saw
himself just the facility data where the
money flows through he talked about not
three betting at all against Andy Robo
because he was just gonna play against
the other players his money did not have
to come from Andy Robo whereas online
players you know we're way too much
focused on the EV of a certain note uh
also actually and this is I think a big
mistake that online players often make
when copying solvers and GTO
realizing that I think we gave the
example of he said a lot of the money is
made on the river so if people play
their hand quite face up or they have
clear mistakes on the river
then obviously in a solver or even a
pre-flop Sims this is taking in
consideration that on the river there's
no EV because we're playing against a
solver right whereas if on the river
suddenly we have huge tells on the
player or they're gonna play their hands
very face up obviously pre-flop we can
suddenly get away with playing a lot of
hands okay because we just have more
information and we're going to make
better decisions so you can actually be
very flexible with your strategies when
information increases and this is
especially true in the live environment
there's also something that he touched
on right the difference between how you
approach strategy in the live
environment compared to online online
there's a bit more of a need to
standardize your decisions because
you're often taking playing multiple
tables we talked about the difference
between between like this GTO approach a
more exploitative approach you can take
a more exploitative approach because he
has a lot of experience there's more
information right you actually know here
I think he was giving the example
between you're actually playing against
Joe not against Joe star 555 it's just
online nickname and you can see when
people are stuck there's a bit more
understanding the psychology behind it
uh and you had just have more time for
your decision so you can actually move
away from you know your standardized
lines all right and also because there's
just more EV on later streets that you
know betting for protection or betting
range in a certain spot this may be less
applicable given the mistakes people
make on later streets so yeah I think
from both perspectives from you know the
mindset the management side of things
the the technical side of things for all
side of things I think we he gave us a
lot of great information so I want to
thank him again for coming on and
sharing this with us I want to thank all
the listeners again for tuning in if you
made it all the way to the end this is
probably one of our longest episodes
that we've ever done uh for me
personally time for Dubai I hope for you
as well so thank you you're a very
dedicated listener if you're still
listening to my voice right now I'm
gonna cut it off right here because it's
already been too long thanks again for
tuning in and see you in the next
