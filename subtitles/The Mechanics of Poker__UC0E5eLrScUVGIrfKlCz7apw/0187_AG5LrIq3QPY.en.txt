and so this is something that can be
really hard for a lot of poker players
to accept if if they want to accept it
is that you know we want to feel like
we're super smart when we're playing
poker like we're so like I can do better
than like a simple protocol of like just
bet your Bluffs like half the time or 70
whatever you know I'm smarter than that
I know the blockers I know the situation
yada yada yada most of the time simple
protocols and especially on early
streets are just going to outperform you
know whatever lineus or ever would
really attempt to
do many players who are listening to the
podcast are probably now uh very
motivated to start to deliberately work
on their game often players don't really
know what to work on so two questions
how should people go about and how do
you go about finding your leagues and
then how would
you best work on improving
those
okay so for individual people I know I
have a very specific you know highly
regimented highly logical approach to
the game that works for me and it's a a
routine and a style that I've cultivated
over years it's not going to copy and
paste to everybody and you know I think
there's some people that are just very
intuitive that would not really want to
sit down and think that hard about all
of this different stuff um or to do it
in quite this way so that's why in the
beginning I'm really emphasizing on
finding coaches or study material or
whatever it's going to be that really
works for you so if you're as long as
you are putting in some level of effort
to try to cultivate a routine I think
that's the most important part because
this is something that I've developed
through iterations that has worked for
me um finding my own leaks I I mean one
of my favorite tools is hand
toote um panote is a basically a tool
that can really comprehensively help you
review your database so I can
essentially import all the hands I
played let's say on like ACR and it
gives you some very detailed popup stats
of all the different basically the way
you play in every different situation so
I have a tab for like here's how I play
in two bet pot in position pre flop
razor so let's say if I'm button versus
big mind right and then here's for the
turn on here's on the river okay now
what if I'm calling out of the big blind
okay two bet pot out of position pre-f
flop caller here's defending against CET
and not just how I'm defending against
CET here is how I defend against third
pot half pot three quarters overb and
next to that stat you know let's say
it's like I'm folding versus one3 C bet
35% of the time or something I'll have
po solvers number which I figured out or
that Pat figured out through doing um
multi fop aggregation reports in po so I
can compare what I'm doing to what po
solver is doing and I can get a sense of
like okay at the bare minimum my
frequencies are basically correct here
and also have a strong sense of what um
the range compositions would be in each
of these so hote can also help you see
like okay here's how often I'm check
raising a set or two pair or whatever
and so you can get a sense of like okay
I'm relatively balanced in this area so
I'm playing well I don't need to study
this as hard but let's see let's say
like oh I'm overfolded versus the half
pot you know by like 2% or something or
3% even for me small amount is an error
that's intolerable right so it's like
okay um I know maybe I'll write that
down in my notebook okay over folding
versus half pot and I'll set that
intention when I'm going into a session
of like okay just remember to you know
kind of calibrate a little bit with the
vers the half pot bets and so I
basically have the entire game tree sort
of mapped out in Hand toote of like
every basically common situation how
often I'm using different sizings and
comparing that to poo
solver um and how how well I'm defending
against BS across the entire game tree
and I'm constantly figuring out like if
there's a leak to plug I'm going to leak
it or going to plug it and focusing on
that um specifically so if I'm yeah
basically if I'm
overfolded to get to that as quickly as
possible um and start steering it in the
right direction all right then also
maybe some situations usually when I if
I look at my own game and I'm
deviating
like or for example I I put I put a hand
in in in Wizard or something and it says
Hey minus to BB play I'm like okay yes
but like some deviations are are on
purpose right like the goal is not n
some it depends obviously the level I
mean you play 2550 against some of the
best in the world short-handed then you
better be very accurate but it doesn't
necessarily mean that if you deviate in
a certain in a certain note like
basically it should just raise your
awareness but like hey you're deviating
here do you have a good reason for
that sure so you might have personal
targets you don't necessarily have to
use po solver as an example but you have
a target range of what you want to be in
each different Zone and try to Aspire to
do that yeah may maybe you're playing to
GTO in a spot where you should be sure
more out of line for example I think
also I think we touched on that a little
bit previous in the podcast as well but
in terms of improving your leaks uh like
I'm sure I'm sure you've seen monitors
Maybe you've done it yourself I've done
it myself where you're just like uh I
don't know call River call Rover F River
you you hang like these notepads telling
you that you should do something uh okay
but sometimes it doesn't really work or
most of the times it doesn't really work
you have to when you sp a league you
have to find the origin of the league so
for example let's say you over fold in a
certain spot well that might be because
your range composition on a previous
street is not well done so basically if
you just say I should call River more
but every time you have nothing on the
river because the way you construct your
rage just calling more might actually
not be not be very not be a very good
solution it's
actually it's actually a leak on a
previous street that makes you fold
River more that's exactly where the
strategy development comes in though of
why I focus on like okay here's how I'm
going to play a balanced range
relatively speaking on each street so I
know it pays off it just makes me so
much harder to play against in general
because so much of it winds up being
sort of pre Med itated in a way of like
I play a good flop stab range so it just
extrapolates that it's kind of harder to
play against me by the time you get to
the river like if I check back the turn
I'm gonna have uh just kind of a much
stronger range than if someone's not
protecting as much yeah so B so
basically in the report you see okay I'm
deviating here from Theory then you
might open a solver look at the range
let's say the whole po bets oh is it
simply because I'm missing the hands
with these type of hor istics as a call
and like you said you go in game most
probably then if you're like I have that
as well it's like oh I I know I should
call more so then there's like a spot
you feel like eh it's close oh this is
exactly one of the spots where I clearly
over folding so my intuition says it's
closed but actually I'm over folding so
probably everything that's close I
should just move to call relatively easy
spot to fix but yeah it becomes harder
when for example you're like you go to
this later Street you're like okay so P
raes these hands call his hands and
they're like wait but I don't have these
hands you have to be realistic with
yourself as well there think it's very
easy to just be like oh yeah okay but
forget the fact that you you never have
those hands in the first place yeah I
think that's what so I do a lot of I use
the drill feature in GTO wizard really
often as well so if I see okay like I'm
over folding versus a half pot sead or
whatever I have tons of different drills
with colorcoded tags that I go to uh
pretty frequently and so I'll just maybe
I'll pull that up of like okay I'm going
to go through 20 of these and then um
just as a refresher and then like you
said like if you're in a spot where it
feels close and you know that's like
your leak it can make sense to kind of
defer towards maybe calling if your leak
is over folding because you're basically
sort of calibrating for a bias that you
have because you might have a bias that
is weighted towards folding and you
adjust it by kind of overriding it a
little bit when you get that feeling
like okay this is really close because
if you were able to into it what was
truly close you wouldn't be overfolded
so your meter is probably a little bit
off in that scenario yeah and basically
by doing the strategy creation you build
better
intuition so next time by your your
intuition becomes more
correct it's just a ton of drilling but
yeah yeah a ton of a ton of drilling do
you have like because then what I
sometimes would struggle with like so I
I feel like I feel like I know something
then and then I'll move on on to a
different point but if I don't pay
enough attention to the other point it
might it the league might start to come
back do you have your experience
compared to like let's say for example
you build a wall right to hold to hold
back the water and at some point a
little hole comes out well you've
identified the hole so you stick your
finger in it and they're like or or you
you know you put something on it and you
work on a different hole but if you
don't pay attention the other hole opens
up again but
like like I've kind of accepted that you
know
will always exist there yeah well yes I
mean you are describing essentially the
Marquee problem of like coaching small
Stakes players first of all like that's
always G to be uh a thing that would
come up is trying to play whack-a-mole
with all these different leaks I mean
part of why I study so goddamn hard is
to minimize how many uh leaks that I
might have in my game but it poker so
complicated that of course you're never
going to be perfect there's always going
to be something that you have have
that's you know exploitable but that's
why I value the simplified strategies
and try to simplify things when possible
and not get you know I'd like to use as
few sizings as possible in any
situation um so that I can more reliably
you know get to the river while losing
as little Eevee as
possible Yeah so basically then your
River decisions become or at least
because your range is better intact it's
easier to to play the latest stre so how
do you then I get this question actually
a lot and people have various ideas
about this so how do you then determine
your bet size scheme let's say for
example you open a part of the tree and
there are some situations where where a
solver clearly where where like the
risks are quite clear right you lean to
a lot of big bets you lean to a lot of
small bets but then there's some spots
where it's like it bats 20% one3 20% 3
quarter 20% overb now what do you
do are we talking about on the Flop uh
this happens flop sometimes on turn
definitely on the river obvious so okay
yeah I was going to say so how would
that impact for you flop turn River how
do you yeah so something on the Flop I
think this is where coming up with the
multi flop subset you know comes in
where you can say okay here's the GTO
Baseline if I give po like 30% pot 50
751 125 what is the EV for the in
position see better and then let's say
all right on this specific texture I'm
going to let it either bet half pot or
check and what is the EV how much did I
actually lose by you know conceding that
complexity and what I found is a lot of
the time you don't like you don't lose
as much as you think you do and so by
you know trying to simplify things of
maybe just having one size on a
particular texture on each flop now each
you might not just have one size period
it could be you know yeah texture text
one size per texture yeah but you'll
find that it's a fra a lot of times a
fraction of a percentage of the pot and
so this is something that can be really
hard for a lot of poker players to
accept if if they want to accept it is
that you know we want to feel like we're
super smart when we're playing poke like
we're so like I can do better than like
a simple protocol of like just bet your
Bluffs like half the time or 70 whatever
you know I'm smarter than that I know
the blockers I know the situation yada
yada yada most of the time simple
protocols and especially on early
streets are just going outperform you
know whatever Linus or whoever would
really attempt to do because you're more
accurate
right um I think that yeah I mean
ultimately you don't even need to debate
it it's like that's the the benefit of
it being scientific is like you can just
measure how much EV is lost and then if
you want to you can nolock your own
thing and experiment like okay if I had
four sizings what how would I compose my
range and then you can see how much EV
did I really lose compared to GTO yeah
compared to if I would build a range
myself right and then you get even
another thing is that what you might do
in the quiet of your own room like oh
you're so GTO but maybe when you're
actually playing you know you're too
busy using all your good hands for an
overb because you get excited because
you have a set and you might not you
know I know it's kind of silly but
basically and you might not you're
describing population as a whole right
like it's easier it's easier to screw up
a little bit with with a strong hand and
not find the you know high card with the
UN blocker it's that that's a hand
that's a bit little bit less intuitive
maybe I do feel like just pick a sizing
and because in the end like how you're
going to execute your strategy will
actually determine your EV like you
already said on the Flop give it any any
of the sizings as long as you you know
if you bet small then by all means
usually you bet a lot if you bet big
then at least bet less so the sizing is
is linked with the frequency but if you
then execute that that the execution
will always determine your EV especially
I think on the Flop it doesn't really
matter what you change in the solver
because EV will not really change that
much because it's a solver so whatever
you give it it will execute perfectly on
layer Street and you might play the
optimal sizing but if on a later Street
you screw up that strategy will actually
not be optimal for you so that was
floppy like you said on earlier streets
in general probably you do them the same
on turn like you try to
stick
if to you know because usually as you
get to later you might need two sizings
you know it depends on the situation
like as things get more complicated you
might need to split more but I'd say
just try to trying to use as few sizings
as you can and simplify as much as
possible um and the other thing about
just the Flop is that um you might have
a certain exploitability like let's say
0.3% of the pot 0.4% of the pot that's
also with po having Clairvoyance over
how you just constructed your range but
a real person doesn't know first of all
they don't know how you constructed your
range to begin with second of all they
don't know how to maximally exploit It
Anyway even if they knew what you were
doing so in practice it's usually like
this is the worst case scenario as you
lose this percentage of the pot um
because that's the max exploit in in
reality is going to be less than
that
