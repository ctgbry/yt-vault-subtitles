please go for the more complicated
strategy you you can you can start
throwing some donkey donkey donkey
donkey Everyone likes a donkey D donkey
donkey for example I see sometimes
students they uh they go over different
textures are you more of like no I use
one side let's just simplify one third
on all boards or do you add a lot of new
ones to textures or how would you
recommend or how would you recommend
studying this that's actually the very
good question
because um when I first had my coaches
with good players they always tend to
say like you should simplify your
strategy as as much as you can you
should just go one size every street you
shouldn't do any dunks and stuff like
that and those are people who beat in
like 1K 2K uh or even high stakes so
it's not like nl50 guys right um and I
tend to simplify because of them a lot
but then when I reached 1K 2K and I was
just playing it consistently not going
for the high stakes because they are
dead just like I mentioned I find myself
that uh it's very boring for me to play
poker and even when I wre battle like
tough opponents it's really boring
because I'm just basically know what I
would do and this is just so easy and
this is just so it becomes not more of a
pocker but just like printing the money
bum BLM BM so boring and that's it's not
an advice but if
you um if you have good win rate but you
feel like you're already bought please
go uh for the for the more complicated
strategy you you can you can start uh
throwing some donkey donkey yeah donkey
donkey Everyone likes a donkey donkey
donkey donkey
I I love those in your videos uh all of
these donkey donys this is great so you
can just start complicating your
strategy not only because there is like
huge Edge between that yeah like
everybody said there is no much Edge if
you go one size or two size but actually
it's not completely true because it's
not big Edge against solver but against
your opponent it might be like a huge
Edge actually so it's not that easy as
well uh here is the beauty of Poker but
only for not to get too Bor in your
poker
routine is it's already worth it I think
so now I I tend to uh study some like
rare spots
to and add some sizings like over Bing
flops like donin turns like um just
straight uh jamming with the flops or in
for bed parts just using like uh two
Street game in free bed parts all of
that stuff I just study and it's not
because I think uh this would gain me an
edge it's just because I would like to
see uh the beauty of the game uh to
extend my knowledge uh to to be prepared
for different spots and if I feel like
oh this is very good I would Implement
that in my strategy but I don't have to
I can just study it to get the bigger
picture and it helps a lot uh and I see
that um doing that helps actually in
different ways um I find myself a lot in
spots I don't study that I took them
more creative you know like yeah you you
you you understand you understand like
cause effect relationship when certain
variables line up in certain ways this
is usually going to be the consequence
so you're able to
this is actually something that the way
I like to teach as well you kind of zoom
out more focus on the impact certain
variables have on strategies kind of the
mechanics behind the game and that
allows you to problem solve better in
game so that even if you're in a
situation that you've never been in
before well you kind of know like what
what drivve strategies right so you're
able to problem solve and be more
creative naturally not force you're not
trying to memorize a complex strategy
know but it comes more intuitively
because you understand the drivers
behind
strategy yeah yeah sure and
um at at least it's more fun to play
like that to yeah you you think you
think if you only play simplified
strategies all the time you stop
thinking yeah that that's a point I'm
trying to say that simplifying
strategies is bad only because it's not
bad for your win rate it's actually
great for your win rate especially if
you want to uh be just pretty good
pretty good rack but not the top rack
but it's very dangerous because you can
just stop thinking and if you do all of
these complicated stuff you you can just
uh switch to the thinking mod in all of
the game all of the hands you play even
in those like which are so common when
you just snap bad 3 33% pot because
you're used to you can just like oh what
if I go like half pot here uh how is he
supposed to react and uh Here Comes
Stefan as well
again uh because what I really like
about Stefan is just he not only feel
this on the tables he is also like
really free to uh play every every crazy
idea he gets uh because like he we had a
spot on
5K maybe like two months ago which is
pretty interesting I think I opened cut
off he defended uh Boton blinds folded
and uh B came like 864 or something I
checked and he went for the 75% on that
flop and all their uh solver guys would
screenshot uh this immediately and say
like you're supposed to go one uh 25%
20% 33% you you're supposed to go a lot
and very small but he just go 7 Stefan
he he can even overb this Swap and what
is he trying to do is like hey I know
how to do that I know that I supposed to
go 25 but I would like to go 75 and what
are you gonna do with that do you know
what you should do how yeah how you're
gonna approach this spot what are you
gonna do about that and he does a lot of
this stuff and it's not only building an
edge it's just uh having more fun in the
game which gets people out of their
comfort zone right if you get people out
of comfort zone out of the lines that
they're used to they're more likely to
screw up and make
mistakes yeah yeah so and he just went
75 and he does a lot of this stuff and I
respect a lot and I'm trying to do kind
of same uh but it's actually pretty hard
because you have to study a lot not to
uh [ __ ] up too much but at least it's
more interesting that is the thing right
like I've I've I've been struggling in
ways to explain this nowadays I feel
like I have a good a good way
simplification has a place it has a
place what you what you mentioned in
like your Baseline strategy in your
Baseline strategy what you're trying to
do is you're trying to not [ __ ] up okay
you're trying to make the play that
can't be bad but from there if that's
all you do you stop to think and poker
becomes very boring and you don't get
the maximum out of your poker win rate
it's so that from there you can start to
explore all the other option and try to
maximize your wiim rate try to
capitalize on different place okay so
both are necessary to some degree if I
would say if you have no idea of what
your Baseline strategy is then by all
means go in the solver go build a good
solid Baseline strategy that's designed
not to lose try to simplify that as as
much as possible and then from there you
can add layers from there you can take
more information be creative on top of
the on top of the tables um uh actually
this reminded me the the thing that you
said what Stefan throw out of 75
reminded me of something that Owen Mur
said in one of her previous episode
mentioned when a thing when a thing
that's not a thing becomes a thing so
basically you do a thing that's not a
thing but depending on how your opponent
response it can become a thing yeah yeah
yeah I really I I really love that one
that one really stick stick stick by me
I really really really like that one
also uh just like I said I love the game
and poker is so beautiful because when
your opponent is uh going in some
Direction all of the strategy actually
shifts a lot and uh
sometimes you can say like uh I always
it's kind of funny that I always see
these like people who just screenshot
GTO Wizard and saying like Oh my he did
such a big mistake how he supposed to
play 5K and now he's just such a fish
there is no such a sient right here but
there might be a lot behind that and
maybe he prepared and he doing just such
a great thing right here which you are
just don't
understand completely because um yeah if
you try to Lo strategies and solver you
can see all of this really crazy uh
shifts in strategies and uh
yeah and people would never play like a
GTO Bots I think because they're just
people yeah sure they can just go RCA uh
but if you are playing against people
and he's for sure honest and he plays
himself he would never play like a gtot
I'm pretty sure and uh if you understand
his nature how and why is he uh deciding
to to do something you can actually uh
differ a lot from dto strategy yeah and
I'm not saying that I'm a huge Crusher
and I'm like exploiting everyone but
that's a really beautiful part of this
game which I love and uh which drives me
a lot uh to keep studying because it's
so interesting that and it's so
competitive that um you can um always do
this like race you know between you and
your opponents and your and population
and all that so yeah I mean like um some
strategy which now looks like yeah this
is right strategy in two years in if
people uh you know change a lot can be
not the best strategy and other like for
example probably against people it's
really good uh to uh like um I
remember um that um I love a Lavin I I
don't remember his name mat I think he
you had him on the B and it was really
great po respect um and we actually but
a lot on we wpn he is a great player and
remember he said that he just um went
crazy fre betting every hand from big
blind and this is just such a good thing
that uh in poker it's possible to go
like that and still crush a lot and
actually it might be really good
strategy in the pools where which don't
have any like heart possible it might be
really good yeah I mean like even let's
say he played three bet only he he
played three bet only from the from all
positions right that's some point he he
experimented he never call only three
bet all positions also from big big
blind yeah and big blind is the most
important here I mean like the funniest
thing for me here is I think that it's
possible if you just um put all of the
high stakes players in the pool they
don't get any H it's probably the best
strategy to just triet too
much I mean it's probably can be even in
high stakes uh population it can be the
best strategy this is a really cool
thing yeah and czy I think I think kind
of kind of summing this up is like we
have to appreciate how and understand
how fragile the equilibrium is right you
mentioned a can do this can do that for
example I can throw out a donkey but but
someone says hey you shouldn't dunk here
like well okay if I dunk a board that
should not be dunked and if I'm over
dunking it he should be folding zero
raising me 50 but he's actually falling
so who's the idiot now you
know donke this thing about donke is
just so crazy because every dunk which
is not supposed to be you should
supposed to raise like huge huge Mar
yeah you should raise F little and I
throw out a dunk on a board that I
shouldn't dunk and the guy fools I'm
like yeah then who makes the mistake
here
yeah yeah and and he would take a
screenshot and say like yeah Wako is a
very bad shape he he haven't study por
he didn't understand that this board
should not be dunked yeah exactly or
also like and also like like people
don't know your exact range it can also
be that let's say for example my dunk in
a certain spot I would say this probably
what happens more on turn river that
let's say my dunk is too strong or too
weak which part of the range should you
attack should you attack my donk that's
too strong or should you attack my check
that's too to week and then like for
example if I don't dunk do they realize
I have a dunking range so my checking
range is not fully intact and do they
then understand the consequences of that
because you talked about sizing well
let's say I let's say I dunk out a lot
of my strong hands and I check a lot of
my weak hands then let's say the range
is intact the solver might be limited to
betting three quarters but if I don't go
my strong hands and check on my weak
hands suddenly it can now bet 300% pot
so you see someone see Stefan betting
300% pot while the solver says hey you
can only bet three as well probably he
understands the equities or how the
ranges are lining up in this situation
way better than the person
screenshotting GTO Wizard and trying to
make fun of Stefan right I would say I
would bet that Stefan has a better idea
of the ranges that are actually in place
and the equities that are running in
this hand then than the person uh uh
observing
[Music]
it
