today's episode
[Music]
there my fellow poker enthusiasts
welcome back to another episode of the
mechanics of poker podcast today we are
connected to spain to have a chat with
high stakes spanish cash game player
jose jimenez also known as jm big joe
online well like many spanish players he
is resident in andorra which is probably
one of the countries i would say with
the most amount of crushing poker
players in the world another day goes by
i don't play against someone from
andorra
however he doesn't spend all his time
there as he loves to travel and
describes himself more as a nomad he is
very into yoga meditation surfing and
nature he has mentioned actually to me
that he loves to be connected with it by
walking barefoot if he has the chance
and is known for hugging trees which is
actually i saw a profile picture that he
has on his instagram so there's a lot of
love for nature right there he has also
been to various silent retreats where
you basically sit in silence meditating
often for a week or more which is
actually something that i'm still eager
to try myself and i'm very curious to
hear how
he thinks his lifestyle around poker has
contributed to his success
adam i know you are an advanced
meditator yourself and we have already
discussed the value of meditation many
times on this podcast have you ever done
a silent retreat and if so why do you
think it's beneficial
well yeah i've been meditating for about
seven years probably every day around 20
to 30 minutes on average i haven't done
a silent retreat and i'm very keen to do
one as well and yeah i think the
benefits relative to meditating would
just be that immersive experience so you
get to remove all stimulus for prolonged
period of time generally you're going to
spend a lot of that time meditating or
being in nature see i can imagine doing
four days to seven days full sighted
retreat would be amazing you'll come out
with a great sense of clarity but i
haven't done it yet so uh i'll let you
know if i do it in the future when i
make time for it yeah i'm really excited
for today's guest he seems like a very
holistic guy looks at his health very
into nature into meditating has a very
diverse background of interest outside
the poker wells pursuing yep high stakes
poker so yeah really curious to see how
he fits it all together and it's going
to be a wide range of conversation with
many topics for the audience
yeah i'm very curious myself as well
before however we get into the
conversation with jose i would like to
remind our audience that we have only
one week left on our closing seal

further ado though let's get into our
conversation with jose
will take it over into english uh i
wanted to start off this part with
what got you into poker
you mentioned as many others before you
that you like the competitive aspect
that poker gives but i think also the
opportunity for growth being a poker
player can bring you because you
mentioned that you always strive towards
becoming better every day probably not
only in poker but also in life
since
what age and in which activity do you
recall first realizing that being on a
continuous path of developing and
getting better in something is so
rewarding for you and could you describe
the feeling this gives you
okay let's see how i start see um
i started poker because i like to play
games uh
about strategy games like asian fanfare
world warcraft
um but i couldn't win i couldn't earn
money with that so it's okay i start to
watch like a high-stakes poker with uh
feel ivy
um
[Music]
so i said okay they are earning a lot of
money so why i cannot why i cannot do
this so if i like games so i'm gonna i'm
gonna i'm gonna play poker and let's see
what happened okay um so
uh this was my my
my
why i started to play poker but and then
on the way
i realized that poker is a big tool
to grow
because it's so similar to life
but this was um
much
later uh because um
when i started to play poker i didn't i
think started the
the uh the spiritual past like a
developing path
like the power of now
meditation
um this this kind of thing
so when
but um i started in this kind of things
because
when i play i was playing poker i need
to
drink red bull
to be focused so i said
okay
this is not healthy this this can't be i
mean this
has to be another thing to get focused
and don't need like red bull or a lot of
coffee or
this kind of things so i
um
i found the i i missed the meditation
uh it's like a bipass and a meditation
and focusing on your breath breathe your
breath
and
observing your body your thoughts
your feelings your sensations
so i started to meditate and then that
was the click the beginning of my
spiritual way
spiritual path
i don't know if um can you uh just you
ask me many things so i don't know where
uh
what i have to do now i mean well i i i
i can understand i did indeed uh uh give
you quite a broad question but you gave
a lot of interesting information mainly
yeah that you played already competitive
games before you started to play poker
was for example
because you mentioned that when playing
poker uh focus apparently was an issue
right you maybe noticed that you were
making mistakes due to not being focused
when you were playing other games like
age of empires was focus already a
problem back then
i didn't know because
there were there were money you know
there is no money
in the middle so
i know i i i remember uh i wasn't so
good i mean i wasn't okay but it wasn't
good
so i don't know why so maybe this was
one of the other things right but when i
i go into poker
then i you know have this serious if you
make a mistake you lose money
so
it's like a money was uh
uh
to know something because you i don't
want to lose because if you lose so you
cannot live so you have to quit poker
and
you know i i one i don't like to lose
you know it's like a
iso competitive in the past
with the the with the war
because um if i you know i have like um
when i was a child
um i have like a problem with my family
with my father my mom
so
my father left
so i think i realized
now um
my spiritual path
that
i
i have to
be good
because if i'm good people love me you
know
so
that was my
[Music]
my
best my
my most important point to be good
to be competitive to be the best because
if i'm the best people love me
so
uh it was a very important thing to to
to achieve to highest stakes
in the past in the past for example
because uh before to to start
before to start in the spiritual path i
was already playing like 1k
you know 1k
a little bit of 2k
uh that was 2013.
then i'm i met uh
you know address artillano i was i was
coach coached for him
uh but
in that time i didn't know
anything about um
spiritual things about the developing
ourselves about i i didn't
even know
i could observe my thinking you know
it's like a you know
when you start in meditation when you
start to do you start you start to
realize okay i'm thinking
what the what is this you know i'm
thinking really um
uh i i i get to this
thank thanks to ed cartel with the
powerful now
you know that was the beginning and then
you know it has been like uh
uh
12 years already working myself
knowing myself
and knowing to love myself because i
didn't love me in the past now i i have
a lot of work yet
but everything changed um i think it's a
endless
way i mean in life
everything you want to do everything you
do
all the ways
if you want
are infinite infinite okay there is no
end in any way you can get
um
[Music]
you can get you can go as much as you
want
you understand what i mean
[Music]
that's interesting that you said like
that you made the realization of hey
wait i'm actually thinking and become
conscious of what you're thinking and i
can imagine that if you become conscious
of what you're thinking for example in
poker right often in a poker hand we
think about things that might not be as
relevant as we
would like it to be right we hear
certain thoughts or we're like why the
hell am i thinking this inside this hand
this is completely not relevant do you
still remember like something while you
were observing your thought process in a
hand you were like
jose
this is not very helpful why am i
thinking this do you remember
did you have a moment like that
i don't remember exactly the point in a
hand but
of course that happened because it still
happened in my life
i mean i'm talking with someone and then
i start to think about other things that
it's not important now so it's like why
are you doing having you are here or not
um in poker
now i'm so
i have a amazing uh
work ethic uh i'm so professional and so
serious
so i have a big routine before to go
poker i don't
like i don't have any
i don't open skype anything i mean only
poker only focusing in poker i play
along
uh with my
earphones um with uh
like a ocean sounds
in the background
uh i i wake up i meditate
uh i do some exercise
to wake up the mind is for me so
important sometimes you wake you wake up
like a little bit like a slow
then
you start you do exercise for
10 minutes you have to get sweat sweat
sweat yeah
and then you mind wow yeah and this is
it's amazing and that is um
evolutive because in the past when you
go to hunt
you know you have to be away you know so
uh this is a power of a book about that
like a the club of the five
[Music]
this amazing book is
wow so i wake up i meditate i do
exercise
that's it
robin sharma the 5 a.m club
i see so right i see amazing book
amazing book
um
why is it so amazing
because uh
i'll show you
what to do um
to be good
at what you are doing i mean because you
are not uh for example yeah if you
you read the book and you apply the book
like a stray
um when you wake up at 5 a.m
okay everything is quiet
life people is sleeping so you have you
don't have um
[Music]
distractions
that's important
and then
if you don't wake up a fire um at 5 00
a.m okay so anyway you can
you can have an environment
with no detraction it's not destruction
okay for example
i don't i don't open the phone i mean i
don't i don't take the phone what's up i
need anything until i finish my day
you know actually in my whatsapp i have
a phrase that i check the whatsapp one
or twice per week
you know
if you want if something is important
please call me
or send me an email you know in the last
three years i didn't get a call an
online email because uh a friend wants
to have dinner with me you know so okay
so there's not anything important
actually
so
there is a book amazing book two about
this the
seventh
highly efficient people i think yeah uh
some
that books that 105 a.m i mean are so
important to
to to know what is important and what is
not and
and be and be like
focusing what you're doing
and be present you know in what you're
doing
be here be present so that's now for me
i think this
is the
the most important point
to be good
to achieve high stakes
this one was one and another one was the
the
to learn
of course when you play 2k plus you have
to learn pio for sure
because you have to know i mean actually
i don't
um i don't know if i is good or bad but
i mean
in life nothing is good or bad okay but
um
it's important to know your opponent's
strategy
so i don't care if you are going to use
that or not but if i know my opening
strategy
i know what i'm gonna do i mean i'm in
uh like i see there's another book right
there the art of war or something that
talk about
actually i i have to do it but
that's important i mean if you know your
strategy your opening strategy
it's amazing
so
yeah i think i think he has a phrase
i i don't think i can quote it exactly
but it says something like if you know
your opponent uh
you win one out of two wars if you know
yourself and your opponent you will be
victorious something among those things
and if you know neither if you know
neither you will always lose basically
right it's the importance of knowing
your opponent's strategy but also
knowing yourself because if you only
focus on the other you
right to quote
conor mcgregor
i remember it was i think he was
fighting against jose although i've
listened to this clip many times he said
who the [ __ ] is jose aldo it's you
against yourself in there in the ring
right and it's the same in poker we are
often our biggest opponent but
you need to have a certain level of
self-awareness that for example with the
power of now and on your spiritual path
you probably realize that like oh it's
not i'm not losing because of my
opponents at the table i'm losing
because of myself
and i think especially in the beginning
i remember when i started to play poker
and this is probably similar for you i
just sat down and expected yeah what i
knew to come out i didn't understand
there was a performance aspect right
like you say you wake up you meditate
you do a little bit of exercise to wake
up your mind i always go outside take
some sun you know there's always to to
wake yourself up and you start to
experience that in poker and there was
something interesting that you also
brought up the necessity because you
play this game for money and you want to
win and losing costs you a lot of money
whereas when you're playing eight of
empires and you lose it's like yeah okay
i just played this game for fun right so
the necessity wasn't really the same it
was actually interesting that you also
mentioned uh that your father left and
that caused you
uh basically to want to get validation
from other people if i understood that
correctly right it's sort of
i i think it's
correct me if i'm wrong here but it's
like okay i didn't get the law from my
father that i wanted so therefore i'm
gonna try to be liked by everyone around
me
which you know
can have a negative aspect but for you
it sounded also like it has a positive
aspect which is
you were then trying to trying to be
very good at a lot of things to receive
this love
and nowadays you said that you love
yourself more so it's not really
necessary as much could you maybe walk
us through that path yeah
now i i love
myself more but anyway these are endless
way endless
way
i have a very
scar a big scar
a big big scar so you need a lot of work
and time
to
you
so
uh the most important thing is to be in
the process and every day you try to be
better and conscious it's going to be
better
but of course i a human i still want
the love of people you know but
in a different way you know some kind of
different way but now it's less
important for me
because
i'm more i'm
more comfortable with me so i need the
people less
but
you know what i mean um
the same but different same but
different you know you have in thailand
have you been in thailand some same but
different yeah
did you notice maybe a certain
motivation
drop because in one way this kind of
fuse you right to be try to become the
best to earn validation from other
people around you that for example in
this case you didn't get from your
father after you realized that that that
was kind of a driving one of your
drivers
behind trying to become a successful
poker player did you then notice like a
certain drip drop in motivation uh no no
because
i i like to be now i like to be better
because for myself
so
that's the most important part when you
realize this
like i love to grow
i love to roll um
[Music]
if i'm
it's not like better it's like a
if i grow
i'm
quiet
i mean with myself like a
relaxed
peaceful
so
for me the most important thing in life
is to be
in peace you know to be quiet
uh being depressed and quiet and be here
and
then that's so this is my past now um
for that uh i still have a lot of
motivation because i like i love the
game actually another other thing
but i'm good in poker is because i love
the game
i love the game i love strategy
competition i i love the freedom i can
do everything with poker i live
everywhere i i i i don't remember i
don't remember the last time i i didn't
um
[Music]
uh i couldn't do something
if i want to do something i do it you
know because i don't have the
problem of money you know
uh this was this
understand this what uh what i meant
yeah yeah
you you so you're more
your present moment how i understood
your present moment you're very much
okay with it because you don't need
anything more right i think this is also
this is this is a bit buddhism or
meditation i don't know but like the
present is okay right often if you would
observe it we often worry and envy
things that are in the future and
actually not really relevant okay maybe
made relevant by society because we want
to have a certain status or something
and we observe or we kind of consume our
minds we're trying to achieve something
for
for reasons that are not really
purposeful right yeah yeah that's the
thing i think that's so so difficult and
this day what everything
says you know the big master says you
know okay
um
[Music]
but another thing talking about
uh
talking about this now um
the last month i mean i've been playing
high stake like
for the last year
many hours a lot of stress
um i love the game but i didn't do
i didn't i only play poker i only
studied poker 12 hour per day 14 hour
per day
last month
15th of may
i left playa carmen um because i have i
live in andorra actually so i want this
to stop i wanted to go out from poker
for a while
because when you are so inside when you
are so
deep in something
you cannot
see outside i mean in life there is
amazing things
but if you are focusing only in one
thing maybe you are losing a lot of
things a lot of a lot of good things you
know and i love poker so i could be i i
could
be playing poker there the whole my
whole life but
i mean
i'm a little bit
because i'm in my comfort zone
so
may i scare about i want to to know i
want to see if there is
other things in life that i'll i'll i
like i um i love too you know that's
what i mean so
when you're very much in the poker grind
that seems like any
that's all that matters this is this is
life and sometimes you need to kind of
distance yourself from that to realize
oh wait there's actually more in life
yeah sure poker is still important to me
but wait there's so much more
there's so much more and
poker
now when you know
people said the first time you achieved
something the first time you achieve
something
is the
like if you achieve
something one two three four times the
first time is the best
about sensations feelings okay so i got
it
i got it now
uh so now
i i was thinking about okay
for why i do this
because of money because i want to get
too
higher
or
what what now you know what now okay
because if i don't think about this
i can
i can play i can play play play play and
money for what i mean so now i don't
need to work actually you know
because um i earn a lot of money to buy
some houses
and rent it and for
i need like um maybe two thousand euros
per month to live
so i i get this already with my house so
okay money is not now the motivation
so
what i won't do well no
this is actually quite interesting
because
uh i think a lot of poker players
they are very driven by becoming the
best or making an x amount of money and
then when they reach
that goal right often already at a very
young age the next question is sort of
now what
and it seems like you have thought about
this question quite well like
why
do i continue to play poker and why
in which way does it fulfill me so in
which other way financial freedom is out
of the way as you said right money is no
longer the motivation then why do you
keep on playing why is it so fulfilling
to you to
you know maybe try to become the best i
know you know you try to be play the
highest stakes
what what makes that so fulfilling for
you or and it's mainly probably the
process right because you're very much
in the moment it's not like oh i want to
become the best because then i will feel
in a certain way i feel like you're
definitely a more evolved spiritual
creature that you're like no it's the
process day by day
yeah it's a between right because i i
still fighting with with that with
to be love for to be um love for the
rest to be the best because people is
gonna accept little i still fighting
with that
but now i'm conscious of that i work a
lot that's so i i can make a decision i
can
okay i i i have this
this is my weakness
and but conscious i can't do this
so
to play high stakes you know you have to
be like
okay it's your life
you wake up with poker you drink with
pocket i mean i drink with poker i i
drink with hands
so it's 24 hours
uh so i think i don't i don't want that
for now
i don't know but maybe yes you know it's
like maybe next month i told you what
i'm gonna play high stake again so i
feel it look it's okay it's okay but now
i think about okay i can still i can
play 1k
501k maybe maybe 2k if the type the
table is very good but you know like uh
okay
um
i can i can be in poker like six hours
per day
and then do other other things you know
because i don't need money i love poker
so i want to play poker because uh help
me to help people
so when i play poker when poker for me
is a big tool
to get to
people uh to help people
to change people's lives
actually i don't like to coach
i like to coach people who is
playing like between no limits 15 to 100
because
i'm going to make a change in his life i
mean he's
almost to get a professional so wow
that's amazing you know it's like
helping people to
to be professional and
to maybe have the same life that i have
that my life that makes it
crazy is
like it's like a dream you know i mean
of course i have my
um bad days or my
problems we don't have problems actually
so my conflicts my
uh okay
you know i lose something
of course we are human
but
um
[Music]
our life is crazy it's like
we are in the top the top
so
the point is i i like to help people
maybe change people's lives you know
make a point in his life
so
poker gives me this you know it's a tool
to be able to do this because the mo i
think you are going to ask me later
maybe but um
[Music]
for me the most important thing in life
is
to be a good person
a good person
to help people
of course to get up
when i talk about to be a good person
first
to beat a good person with me
love myself and then if you are able to
love yourself you could you are able to
love people
always in from inside to outside you
know that's something i
um
i've been learning for many years
but
now i really understand in this concept
everything is from outside
when you get that inside
real life realize
outside
realize outside or appear outside
slay mirror with yourself if you love
yourself people are gonna love you
because
you love yourself you love people
people love you like people like love
so it's amazing and if and if someone
has a different
way in life life like for example maybe
you know there's
some people that
there are disconnected with love so
um these things that we don't understand
or
look look doesn't look fine
or
for example i don't know i don't like to
to give us strength extreme examples
uh but um
something do something uh someone do
something to you you say oh why do you
need that oh is this a bad person he's
not a bad person he has his process he
don't love himself so how he's gonna
love you all okay so understand the most
important thing about this is understand
how human works the human how why people
do things
um
um when you know why people do things
uh then you start to be more
empathic
perfect and
of course i'm not i'm not
i understanding i am there i'm trying to
understand people but i'm not like um
supporting them supporting yeah
because always disa conflict with this
when i talk about this like okay so uh
for example a string example um
terrorism people is killing people
because they know they think
if they for example the
um jihadists you have these people
they kill because they think is the best
because they do that
is the best for them for his community
to to survive
and if
they do that they go to heaven heaven
heaven and they're amazing there so
yeah in the end they're also trying to
make the world a better place maybe not
in the in the eyes of others
yeah
but for them i get it so yeah
you you you don't it's it's obviously
it's not the justification but
absolutely
see seeing it through their eyes
you can understand it why in their eyes
the way they believe systems they have
this is actually a good thing to do
yeah and so now go to poker i mean
probably life is same you see go to
poker if i understand why you play that
hand like that
i i'm going to know you better so i know
how to explode exploit you better i am
going to earn more money for you
you know but one of the biggest mistakes
is
um something dude
some players do uh some moves and you
say oh
it's so bad why he did that
he's horrible oh i'm gonna crush you
i mean but that that uh this thinking
this thought
this thinking process
don't um
[Music]
give you anything i mean you don't learn
with this you don't learn with this
process you learn you say okay he do
that he that
he did that
why
why he did that yeah because he he does
it because he thinks it's a good idea
right so you have to figure out
in which way do you think that makes
this a good idea what can i learn from
that in order to exploit you in the
future yeah
and if you have this way of thinking
of maybe you realize that you are wrong
and not him
yeah that that's that's a that's a very
common common issue that you see a day
people just label someone as bad and
they don't keep an open mind for okay he
thinks this is good when would this be
good because we can always learn from
any type of player even from a quote
called bad players the the i think the
players you can learn the most from are
people that you perceive to be not that
great but they still always crush then
there apparently is something that they
do that you don't understand
actually
i remember
uh duka pokker bedo andres artegiano i
had this the same conversation with him
but different way because he had a
different
way to talk but um he said oh why he did
that he's horrible and he told me he's
better than you so
maybe you have to learn him you know
that's so
yes
when someone who is better than you
he's doing something maybe i think you
are there you are wrong and then you of
course and if you
do this with everyone doesn't matter
better or
worse
you are going to learn a lot a lot
i wanted to uh
a lot of goodness thank you a lot for
sharing for sharing all this you
mentioned that you love to win
uh
and i'll be like
you can you can describe to us how
winning makes you feel and why this is
so great but often when you
experience highs
with that also come lows
so
how do you experience the highs
and the lows in poker or do you keep the
lows to a medium and you try to maximum
experience the highs
the highest is uh the earnings
yeah the wins so okay often you know in
order to
to
to open yourself up for extreme emotions
of for example you're very ephoric
because you won a lot
that means you also open yourself up for
the downsides which if you lose you hurt
a lot
how yeah
how do you experience winning and losing
as i think an emotional person an
expressive emotional person
uh i love to win so i'm working on
learn to
if i lose on poker i mean when of
playing football i love football i'm
playing football any any
competitive sport game
if i lose you the other wing okay
so
amazing okay he's happy now so
i'm focusing on
if i lose his his he win so it's good i
love i'm happy for him
you know some kind of this way okay um
then
another point is
life is like this if if i don't lose i
cannot win
if i win like you know it's the duality
duality of life
so i still working a lot of this because
it's not natural uh when i lose okay i
feel i try to be happy for you but i get
serious or i cannot make a joke you know
it's not uh nothing but anyway
um
when we start to learn something it's
not natural when you start to walk
you fall a lot it's not natural for you
you look like a clown you look like a oh
you know
with babies you know so it's a process
and i'm learning how to
lose happily happy
and and then
on poker i'm not ready for this i mean
i'm not ready in the short terms
so what i do
i don't look at how a graph either look
maybe i look my results one per month or
before tomorrow holidays
if i go holidays before to go holidays i
i look
my results
um and then i have a few days to
to calm down you know emotionally
take a take a good a good perspective
you know about
i have to lose because this poker this
life
um
so
this i think is the
way i approach this
yeah i i think it really i'm personally
a big fan of
uh only looking at your results on for
example monthly basis because it feels
like you know then the month starts
fresh you have something uh to work on
you have your missions you focus on the
process right you focus on all the
things that you're trying to improve i'm
sure there's a couple of spots where you
feel like you know you could play a bit
better you focus on that and then in the
end result end of the month you could
take a look at your results uh but
basically if you just focus on the
process of trying to improve your leaks
the end result will be that you will
start to win money uh so i'm a big fan
i'm a big a big fan of that as well not
looking at results i think
one um
very important thing is
to be focusing what is on you i mean you
know the
there are things that depend on of us
and there there are things that
don't depend on us
yeah i said to others like in control
out of your control
exactly yes so
is it me to wake up
meditate exercise study
um
you know play as
as best as i can
but
it's not on me to earn
every day or in every session because
and things
um saying things of that
things of that
weird money i mean
occasionally play poker because they
have a chance a chance to win in short
term short term
is that
why occasionally doesn't play chess
because they cannot win never i mean
they never are able to win okay
they can win i mean of course one
session 100 hands
you know thus thanks to that
we can lift from poker so yeah so this
is again like the positives of losing
the fact that we can lose and the
recreation can win keeps the game alive
sadly
so
because of this i'm
going deep deeper to this
i
i try to make the occasional experience
as best as i can
why because
think about things on this way they are
they are clients
we have a business we are a hotel a
restaurant they come to our restaurant
to to have a good experience
so i'm gonna give you a good experience
in
exchange to money yeah yeah yeah
are paying you money to have a good
experience yeah that's the point so i
when you realize this would you
understand this
i think
your perspective
to them change a lot because you know
you you you um i think you have seen a
lot of people to playing occasionals to
say um hey how are you like that time
like that or what you did or what just
made i mean you are doing this best and
thanks to him you are winning you are
earning money all right why are you
doing it's like if you go to a
restaurant
um
the
the bartenders or whatever you ask for a
drink and give you a
uh
a point a punch uh or something you know
i said oh thank you okay
uh give uh take 20 euros for that thank
you hang on you know see you next time
yeah probably not
probably not see you next time this was
actually something that uh that i
remember in uh the podcast we did with
johann joe viral he really he really
emphasized on that especially in live
poker that you were there to give the
recreational a good experience and he
said that a lot of online players they
don't understand that
they come there to play for money
whereas a recreational come there to
have fun i remember that's what they
said they are there to have fun and it's
your job to make sure that they have as
much fun as possible yeah and you you
are um you can see that
when professional online poker player go
to play live
they
they are like
a mess
it's a different game it's a different
game but you're playing with people you
can see people you have to be
talking you have to actually um maybe
you go to play 1k doesn't matter but
when you play high stakes good life
you have to be fun you have to talk you
have to you cannot be with your
earphones i mean you have to be like a
create a dynamic on the table because
it's going
for that you know
and you
you also mentioned that before taking a
break you like to look at your results
uh to mainly to take a couple of days so
you do that a couple days before you go
on the holiday right not the night
before you have your flight tomorrow you
look at your results because you needed
some time to process and i think could
you maybe give give some tips i think a
lot of players they struggle with this
to kind of let go of poker when they go
on a holiday i think especially when
things went badly and then they're on
holiday and they might feel some
resistance like i'm here
for example something that i have
experienced that you're there but you
don't really want to be there because
poker is going bad and you want to work
on it that's one or you might feel a bit
guilty like i didn't deserve to go on
holiday because i've been playing like
[ __ ]
these are two things that i would say
that that i i would struggle with do you
have any advice
yeah i think the the of the
the last uh
but to to feel a [ __ ] you know like i
should because you didn't
you lose or whatever i think if you do
your best you have to be proud of
yourself i mean it doesn't matter if and
then maybe you make some mistakes that
try to do
better next time and of course you're
gonna make mistakes again this life is
human but try to be better if you try to
be better um
accept
what happened
um i like to talk i like a lot about how
people um you know
i i did like a two
personal retweet some
but you know would be personal tweets
it's the silent retreats right silently
tweet for 10 days focusing on meditation
um on
breath
it's a millennia
millenary uh
technique you know
they said that you have to accept the
reality as it is
you know but
do your best
next the next time
so i think this uh worth a lot for me
when i have that uh feeling
and then when
for example if i look at results and i
lost a lot of course i have like a
um
uh you know what when someone died you
know how to put that
at
wallop it's a grief or something
yeah i have something
when you when you lose something you
have a grief
it's a human feeling it's okay i mean
it's like that
but
now uh it's less intense than before
because i've been working on this for
many years right but i still have that i
remember in 2000 i remember in 2000 2013
when
when i lose many days
i only want to watch netflix and do
nothing because i i feel like so sad and
so down
you know
so i of course i realized that i
realized that i started to work on that
and now i feel grief
but
i understand the short terms i do i did
my best
and
sometimes
uh
as um i i think about okay i still be a
a winner or not but that is i mean
it's not it's normal i know i see you
are when you go out from that
of course you know you're a weak winner
but that feeling that thoughts
it's okay you have to understand that
happens
and
observe that but don't react to that i
mean i mean this is so difficult because
to
to do this
i did two retreats
of 10 days i made it like a one hour per
day like for a long time
i just i'm very present observing my my
day-to-day
it's a long process you know it's not
one day i do this and then the day i get
it no i have to be patient
um
work on that and everything so
uh so i i looked the
going back to the when i looked the
results
actually i looked the result
after the last hand i play
before holidays i play i i i look the
results
if i lose a half angry that's okay and
actually
if i if i played for many days
i realized
uh i think i realized i realized this
like six months ago or something like
that
that i i felt i have the feeling of
ludopathy i mean
when you
when you have drugs i don't know if you
if you
uh try the mdna maybe no okay when you
have drug you know this kind of drug
gives you a high so use a lot of
dopamine or ceremony and then the next
the next days you are very down
because you have to recover your things
right this like in spanish we call we
call it the the mono and the monkey or
the grieving whatever
um
so when i realized that when i play
poker the next day
i want to be
like a lie down i don't want to do
anything i i i think that can nothing
um else is gonna
um
fulfill me
so i only want to play
yeah
so
i i um i i
i tell you i talk about this because um
[Music]
we are talking about the results um
i still uh feeling i still having the
feeling of a little bit down
uh i
win or lose doesn't matter but if i lose
of a little bit more but i know i'm
concerned about that and after two days
it's okay no it's uh it's okay i'm very
happy again i can do many things i'm
motivated to do other things also i
don't know i don't know if this answered
your question or not yeah i mean
you're mainly describing or how i
understood it is losing is part of the
game and you've got very good at dealing
with it mainly through grief okay like
some sometimes bad periods will just
happen and
this is something that's unavoidable
right and you've learned to give it a
place
and detach yourself and maybe your
feelings your self-esteem how you feel
about yourself as a player you've kind
of detached that from the results
obviously in that moment you feel like
[ __ ] the next day you feel like [ __ ] but
maybe in the past you felt like [ __ ] for
a week and now you only feel like [ __ ]
for a day right but in the end i think
this is this is a very important point
that i'm getting from talking to you in
the end you have to realize
that you're human and you will feel like
[ __ ] and that's okay
but the goal is to feel like [ __ ] for a
less period than
you felt before right it's all about
that progress but you really realize a
lot that
certain emotions are just there for you
to experience and like i said the fact
that you're human so a lot of good stuff
in there i personally
uh if i made a big loss i go in hyper
analytic mode where i go through all my
all my hands i filter all the data i
want
i need a diagnose okay it doesn't matter
if it's
if it's me playing bad or if it was just
variants i want to know the diagnose so
if it was purely variance there's almost
nothing i can do i can give it a place
and if it was due to my own mistakes i
feel actually in both cases after a
couple days of doing spending in
hyper-analytic modes i feel good okay
because there's either some things that
came out that i can work on so i can
give it a place and i can even feel
motivated due to a downswing or i can
just give it a place and be like okay
at least i'm playing well you know when
i come back i'll i'll take them down

but without further ado let's get back
to more goodness in this episode
adam you've been very excitedly on the
sideline my apologies for that any any
tips on dealing better with losses
well yeah i've been listening patiently
we've been talking about the power of
now the seven habits of highly effective
people and the 5 vm club so a big fan of
all the topics so far and yeah it's like
your conversation this is perfectly in
your stream
okay let me in let me in
but not all good yeah yeah in terms of
dealing with downspings i really liked
what jose was saying there in terms of
giving himself space from down swings in
terms of not checking results so
frequently but also there's a big level
of acceptance just accepting things for
what they are and this is difficult like
as i was saying this is not a natural
thing that we're good at when you're
losing a pocket it feels like the
world's gonna end you have heightened
emotions in your body that do not feel
nice your mind is going very active into
trying to problem solve things that may
not need to be solved and you've got to
be silent amongst it be the observer
like jose is saying and be okay with
that and that's hard to accept things
not going your way is very very hard
because when you're playing poker you
want to make money you sit there because
you think you can beat your opponents
and you want their money off you off of
them so when you lose money you've got
to deal with the opposite the inverse
feeling of oh wait a second i didn't
meet my expectations money's been taken
from me i'm losing and because pog has
this multi-faceted game we never
actually know why was it me did i mess
up does my strategy suck is this
variance is this guy
getting lucky on me what's happening
here and like you said they're running
with your answer you want a norm you
want to know the answer because once you
know the answer if it's variance you can
accept it if it's your bad player you
can also accept this so yeah dealing
with our results as a poker player is
one of the skills that you just need to
learn and yeah i think jose's experience
i really liked the process you went
through you talk about busy stealing
yourself lots of meditation silent
retreats all these things are really
valuable because they give you space
from thoughts and emotions so you can
put them in their place you can accept
them they're still challenging they're
still heightened at times we still mess
up occasionally but the same time it
gives you space to deal with them see i
think there's a lot of wisdom that's
been coming there and yeah really really
enjoying that conversation i do want to
take it sideways because i know you guys
been checking on lots of topics and i
was wanting to know
about your story a bit so our job with
this podcast is to bring out your kind
of journey to high stakes and in the
questionnaire you mentioned that it took
you 12 years to get to your current
levels you also mentioned that school
was quite easy for you and when you
started poker how easy was pocket was
poker the first thing you tried after
school and how challenging was it when
you first got into the poker
okay
um i see i had
i don't know if lack will exist
i mean
uh i mean
i don't know sorry about this
affirmation um um
i think la lac is a lot a lot in life
surely the opposite what they said in
the beginning uh so i like poker
um
so uh in the beginning
i was so bad
you know you know remember the pokestar
give you like five dollars to play
doing something i i made many many many
many accounts with different people to
get that i lose a lot
blah blah blah
so but i i want to get i want to play i
want to be a professional so what i i i
did
i i'm from malaga yeah i'm from mala
from spain so
um there were a club poker club
so i started to be i started like
dealing to earn some money
and
know the people to play to
be able to play against them better so
and
during the tournament
some guy told me you want to learn poker
so there is a school
called educa poker now i'm teaching
there yeah that's
amazing so
so i i go to the to the school did ha
this happened like one year after i
think
i was like what i i was like one year
going
around you know
i don't know what i was doing whatever
blah blah
so then when i when i arrived when i
knew the school
i started with
um very easy strategies
like 20 videos you know do you remember
the size the phrase like a [ __ ]
spanish shore stack you don't remember
this
i don't know if you remember the work of
this one
yeah yeah you all had the same avatars
right
yeah so so because we played with 20 bbs
and
regulars don't know how to play this and
they make a lot of crazy mistakes like
so it was easy because it was like a
robot
you know it's like a push
uh open push or
so easy you don't make mistake when you
play uh
less clients you less you make less
mistakes
you know so this thing is important in
the process so i started with this i
started to study
study i studied a lot in the school and
i i think i got lacked too because
my i think i have a graph with my navy
under my my green line you know my
earnings
so that helped you a lot too to be like
uh
in the process
if you lose it uv is like that
in the beginning of the poker you don't
understand that and then you you quick
you know so i was
i was um very lucky in my on my process
but
um so this is my beginning and then i
started with this look at poker poker
playing high high high high and when
i had um
when i had the opportunity
i moved because in spain
in 2000
uh
2011 i think
they made a regulation
so you only uh you only could play
against spanish people spanish against
spanish
so if you want to play
higher you can you couldn't
so
there that open a window
to
move with other players
so we made a lot of poker players uh
house um
yeah so that was amazing i mean when if
if you want to learn
in something
you want to learn something you have to
be surrounded by people better than you
in something
they're so so efficient so i have like i
i was lucky there um i moved to then to
you to bournemouth to uk i've been
living in uk like for five years
something like that for five years
but like
three months per year six months per
year and
my english is so good because i never go
with english people sorry
we always with the spanish people you
know it's like crazy
it's the easy way so
i'm sorry about that now
so um they we make a poker player houses
i i went to
only to 100 to 1k in one year
i earned like a i i i had like six
thousand dollars
one rule
and i am that that year i am like 100
000 2011 it was crazy
and after that
um i still living with poker players and
then in
that's when 2011-12
and then 2014 i started with luka poker
with veda with an andres
and then
i
started with raul mestre and then i
started with you know i i always be i
always
uh i've been coached
always for someone better than me i
think for me that's important
someone to guide you
and
be surrounded for people
better than you or
that motivated to keep going
and that is one problem i have now in my
life because when i go to when i first
go to vegas now i i've been playing the
main event um
i'm with the high-stakes poker players
uh i want to play high i want to play
poker i want to play poker you know
because that motivated motivate me a lot
um
but when i go when i'm not surrounded by
poker players then
i i i
i can be i can go
into other perspectives you know i
showed actually i'm so emotional i'm so
so emotional and thanks to be passionate
pipasana helped me a lot
like because it was a
awakening in my life i mean poker i
always a bit for vipassana 2000 2017
i was playing 5k already uh even i was
started in 5k for a while
with a limitless we
you know
passed there i was so spotted
the point is before be passing i was
early with the blue line
after v passenger i mean before
vipassana i was um playing like 5k for
for a while
then i had like a one year um
actually that i did that many times in
my career
because i i will have the conflict
between okay i like poker but i want to
do something else so i have the conflict
during playing poker that happened a lot
to players i think um so i always have
like okay this year i'm gonna go to surf
so in the last time i did this the last
time i did this i was playing like 5k
and one year after
i started in 200
after the personal repeat
so i came from the blue line and i
started with 200
of things to be passed and i think to
to observe the
emotions uh things to accept like alan
said i said things as it is as they are
um
[Music]
i started to earn with the red line i
like that like that
was a crazy change
all right um so
um
okay i don't understand i'm talking a
lot so i don't know what you want to
keep going because i i lost i lost
myself already a little bit so
so many things i can jump in
you ask me how i got where i get
how i started right
yeah yeah no that was great we got
a great path there and some of the
things i got from that was the
importance of learning from others but
also putting yourself in the right
situation like i love the story where
you said you were a dealer for a while
and you you're a dealer because you like
polka and you want to be around poker
and learn from him that's a super
amazing like step to take i'm not sure
how many players would think of being a
dealer so they're around lots of the
players and they can learn from them
then from there you went into a school
again round of the players and you
talked about basically go from 100s
through to one case in one year because
you want to grind the house and you'll
live with the players and yeah myself
when i played poker i had five years of
living with other players and it's very
immersive all you do is live and breathe
poker you go for lunch you talking for a
strategy you go for dinner poker
strategy you grind together you study
together and there's not much else that
goes on in a lot of groundhouses other
than pockets so it gives you this almost
like crash course and like you said if
you're lucky enough or you're able to
find players better than you and you're
a good learner and you put yourself as
kind of a student in that arrangement
you can learn so much quicker than other
people so yeah i think it's a real good
lesson to uh surround yourself with the
right people and like you're saying
right now you're at a point now but
you're obviously very established at
high stakes very good you're probably
struggling to find players who have that
far ahead of you so you get the next
challenge where you become one of the
better players and you're more the
teacher the people around you and like
you said you coach guys you play 50 and
l and now you're sharing your wisdom
with them and obviously you're still in
your own growth curve and it gets more
challenging to uh the higher you get the
ladder to find people who you can learn
from yeah i think that's a an ongoing
thing that you'll continue with yeah
really good stuff and i like that story
so for you in terms of your
progression so we've got 12 years of the
kind of from starting to high stakes
what were the toughest years for you
what were the years when you looked back
on you went oh
i had a lot of challenges during this
year so you talked about your
sabbatical we had a year off when you're
playing five kids and you took a whole
break did all your pasta stuff was any
years or challenging parts of korea
where you really hit a roadblock
yeah i think the
biggest problem for me was of course
myself um the compromise
and the
uh
clarity of what i want to do
for example um
uh i had a problem with compromise uh in
my life with commitment actually as you
know
if you remember my did you remember my
my nick's names always are saying
something to me i mean in 888 like my
name is commitment okay
um
in in
american carver america uh winning
winning the time americans
my
talk about being unknown because it's
like a being like
everything if you if you are in the know
you are like a present you are okay
what's coming everything's changing so
so all my internet um
uh say something to me so my biggest my
biggest
problem was commitment
commitment and
to don't know what i want to do with
life because
i think a lot i have many like a crucial
existence
like uh why i'm here why i live
what the purpose
doesn't make sense
you know so i was battling with this i
was struggling with this for many years
till lasting
till
maybe a few months ago or a few years
maybe one year ago or whatever
and now i still having this
um
struggles or thinkings uh of course
now it's like one day or one hour or
three hours four hours you know when the
bus goes for weeks or for for one year
even you know
so i think was that was the
the biggest uh like a problem for me for
me to be like uh going and out going out
going out going out you know um
so and maybe
uh and that this was the the most big
the most um that um then
when i want to go to
when i wanted to play 2k plus
i was about
i didn't know theory
i didn't know a fire i didn't know pilot
so to know pio i know how to work with
fire
um know how to study and
was the
what gave me
the the the the jump because actually
one year ago you know two years ago i
was in ecuador surfing
so
um
i tried to i tried to
to go to 2k a lot even to 1k a lot uh
battling but always in 1k and 2k
they kicked me out always
so last year i mean um i was in ecuador
and there i i tried to achieve to play a
game
and they kicked me out again i i thought
okay so
accept that you are not able to to to be
in 2k
keep go to 1k still live your life
whatever
okay so uh but then one year after i
started with video and that gave me the
jump to high stake
you know to understand bio so difficult
and other thing another important thing
is i'm so bad
with a structure
you know with um structuring my
my life and something no it's my life by
my thinking my thoughts or
the process i
i like a
big beginner extrusion extract
structuring instructing my distracting
things
so
when i started with bio and i started to
write down everything and start to
starting to study spots one by one going
in deep um flop term river uh writing
down all all the concepts
what i learned
um that's that basically
the the level that's the click to be
able to stay um high stakes because or
another important thing about
uh to be able to be in high stakes or to
be able to
occupy like waka said before it's like
to know you are doing well things well
because poker you can be doing something
well and
lose all the times because it's variance
or you have to lose or for example when
you call
a bet on the river you have to win maybe
sometimes like once uh
every three times one minute one third
right at the time
but
the mind the the human
doesn't understand that you cannot be
calling an earning money and losing in
that time that's it's so difficult to
understand
so value gives you that some kind of
way you know when you that's a matter if
you lose that you look
at this uh
because fire is a thing and the humans
are another things because you can
people very well and then you go to the
table and you cannot win because
humans
didn't
they're not doing that yet because
fire's so complex so it's important to
learn by the the how much you play
but
even more
important
apply that
on the human
human way a human
game you know because sometimes they are
so far
and that actually with me
i'm motivated to motivate me
because
i achieve high stakes and
i think
i have to learn a lot
i seek to study say why
it's endless
so that motivates me a lot too because
and actually when you have achieved high
stakes
and you see how people
are so far yet from file
in many spots the wow i think and
and they are crashing
so
that's very motivated what if they
did to me
yeah it sounds like for you a lot of
your progression has been getting things
very clear in your head you're talking
about like compromise and basic
commitments and basically not almost
like not knowing where you're going and
what for i think this is a problem like
an issue a lot of players face where you
get in the poker very simplistically you
basically want to make money it's good
fun and off you go and then you start
making money and then you start in a
good lifestyle and then you're like well
now what now what do i do and sometimes
it can go very deep like for yourself
you went very uh very deep in terms of
what's my life about why am i doing this
who am i going to be um we're trying to
see clarity we're trying to seek some
form of in annoying of like am i on the
right track is this where i should be
going with my life is this meaningful to
me and the sooner you do that the better
because if you go 10 years down one path
before turning around you're going to
have some things to deal with so yeah it
sounds like for you the first kind of
progression growth was getting clear on
who you wanted to be why you're playing
poker and what you need to do then the
next kind of progression especially is
kind of breaking it into two cases
sounded like getting everything
simplified but also creating structures
in your life understanding how pyo
thinks so your game can be more
organized and more structured which
allowed you to play a more theoretical
strategy without getting thrown around
by kind of short-term variance because
you are committed to the kind of
theoretical strategy and then you can
just said structure so i'm guessing
structure applies to your theory game
but also to your kind of life is overall
and getting things organized to make
sure you're executing and i think that's
the
when i look at high stakes players and
high stakes people in general they're
very often a lot more organized their
ideas are very methodical very
structured very professional but they
very rarely start that way it's
something that they learn as they're
trying to progress they hit obstacles
and they start to realize ah wait a
second i need to get this a bit more
neat i need to get this more structured
i need to learn about this so yeah it
sounds like for you you went on a about
a year ago pio became a big part of your
learning tools and you went really deep
to understand it so you could finally
crack these one case two cares and above
and sounds like that's been a massive
progression for you so yeah great stuff
all right so i want to ask you when you
wear that zipline mid sticks maybe
trying to progress to the 1k is did you
have any bad habits that were in your
game i see your typical bc game mistakes
that were stopping you from making
further progress was anything that was
coming up that was preventing you from
moving forward
for me i'm
very emotional
so
when i'm out of my center
i
play i play so bad actually i
when i i met uh the wacko before to the
podcast i told him about that i thought
i told him remember when i think you you
attack me like a speedy player
because when i'm out of my center
i call a lot crazy when i
i've laughed like crazy
so
so it was a good read
yeah it was a good rate but sometimes
that's that's quite deceptive like oh
which jay big joe showed up today i
don't know is my correct today or is it
incorrect
actually
that helped me a lot because of course
um i work a lot of me so i note when i
hang out of my center so maybe i'm one
day two days after my center but then i
like three months in my center so when
someone attacked me like a speedway then
in the future i i can't take that like
an advantage
because i know
uh
he because i know um
that i did some move like it's gonna uh
they're gonna they're going to keep in
his mind because are crazy okay what
this so
out of the line what he's doing you know
so
it's important to when you make some
mistake to know what you say are you
doing
and try to make advantage of that
and always when you make mistakes or
there's some cows in your life or there
is some like for example when you lose
for a
period something for me it's an
opportunity
to learn it's a big opportunity to be
better so if you have this approach
actually um
actually in life everything is about its
perspective
there's many perspectives so try to
take uh to choose the perspective that
help you uh more
and so i think
this the the the now i i i still
battling with this
actually in the last six months
i had um
think i have a personal problem
okay and
and i went so out emotionally
so
in three days
i'll
lose
like 200 2
400 bbs high stakes
and
and that taking me
to to recover that taking me like a 50
000 hands um it was like breathing so
now i know
that um so now after that
what i'm doing
i've been working a lot of my i know
what i happen uh of know what is
happening in my me okay
my feelings my emotions so when i
realized that i'm out of my center i
don't play i do something else
until i go to my center because of for
what i mean you are doing something and
you are going back
because then you have to be like no 100
hours to fixing that problem so if i
know realize that
be conscious and don't do it but of
course
it's not like i said
like i said it's not from one day to
another i made this mistake many times
and i hope this time i finally learned
but maybe
i make the mistake again and it's okay
you know it's okay but
i'm gonna do my best you know it's like
uh this is my my
my my process and
i think this answer to adam i don't know
right very good yeah and i think a lot
of players will relate to that and
you're basically seeing that your
emotions have a wide spectrum and with
that you have a kind of big deviation in
your game so when the wacko catches you
on a highly emotional day when you're
off your center you're getting that
spewy tag and another day is he's going
to be very off with his reads because
you're back in your center i like that
terminology as well i really think it's
it's beneficial for the audience
returning to center it just means i'm
getting back to a clear place i feel
good at myself when you lose your center
it generally means like things are a bit
chaotic a bit disrupted and emotionally
yet they're throwing you around so yeah
i think it's it's good for you to
acknowledge that you're still having
deviations in your game even now but at
the same time you're more conscious
you're more aware you can learn from
quicker but because of your personality
and who you are emotions are still still
there and they occasionally flare up and
you occasionally lose that center and
have to deal with the consequences like
you said losing i think said 2 400 big
blinds in three days because something
happened in your life that threw your
percentage so in the future going
forward again you'll want to be able to
learn from that and avoid playing during
those times but again it's a work of
progress and it takes time to learn and
yeah i think emotions are
such an interesting part of poca i think
most players especially online players
would love to be robots if i could give
them a robot button to press and numb
their motions they'd press it but i
wouldn't want to do it myself but at the
same time we have to deal with a lot as
poker players and you have to learn on
the fly they deal with a lot of
emotional situations and players deal
with them in very varying ways almost
all players who have a lot of success in
poker who've had 12-year careers like
yourself if i do a lot of soul searching
a lot of like working through these
issues and come to terms with the
emotions that come up i think a lot of
it as well comes down from as you said
at the very start of the conversation
with the white guy you are saying
basically um being good at something
that gives gets you loved gets you love
people love me when i'm good at
something now even though you're doing a
lot of work to self-validate yourself
and feel good without that it's still a
big thing where when we all when we do
have success we get validation
externally from other people and from
our friends in our environments so when
poker isn't going well emotions like am
i good enough am i worthy is it i'm am i
an okay person explicitly comes the
surface again just through losing at a
poker session so even though we might
think that we've evolved past it very
often lots of emotions that we haven't
had to deal with in any scenario other
than poca come to the the fortis so yeah
like you were saying as well earlier
pogba is a big opportunity for growth
and sometimes we think it's about growth
in terms of financial but then we kind
of switch it over actually no no it's so
much bigger than that i need to grow as
a person i need to understand myself as
at a very high level in order to achieve
things in poker see i think there's so
many lessons for the audience listening
there yeah i think it's a very common uh
problem and i think players vary in
terms of how much emotion impacts them
so yourself
yeah
um
when you know this that i i'm this
emotional and i'm a human
you know
others
the rest of the players which um i play
against
the same so i try to take advantage of
this too for example what i do
i i i when i play for example with high
stakes player where's like 20 i don't
know 20 maybe 30 i don't know i strike i
look their graph
because if they're earning with some
time they're earning with the red line
sometimes we're losing with the red line
and then i looked you know the two plus
two uh forum you know the high stake uh
hands they they they put there
because when you look at hand you see
how sometimes
uh they are playing like so speak with
you
so when i know someone's playing
speedway or playing more thai i know how
to explode exploit them better
you know because i'm playing so again i
i saw focusing of
me i
of what i have uh in front you know
sorry do you mean when you were uh
you're referring to the the high sex
threat on two plus two do you mean that
for example
you have a normally solid player and
throughout that week you see more spews
of him than normally so you're taking in
consideration when making reads
how far off
his center he is
that's
something so
in private i will let you know which
ones
i took advantage of them because of this
because i saw something
i'm definitely curious to you know uh to
to to hear about this this process
indeed
actually you see this a lot with
recreationals that you have let's say
for example you played with a
recreational couple times
he comes to the table you're like oh yes
it's a will playing 60 40 30 completely
out of his mind and then he just folds
like for three orbits and you're like
what the [ __ ] is going on this is not
you but this is not him today right it's
the range of games someone can have but
i've never really considered it that
much with professionals to be honest
that happened a lot mean a lot not a lot
but happens happens
and when you are playing a lot of times
against battling 300 400 or even not
battling i mean it's like uh
we're 30 maybe 20 30 high stakes in the
same site so
you know that okay this guy now is on
this mood so now i'm gonna be careful
with that because you know it's like so
you try to link it like for example if
you see okay someone has been is in it
clearly in a downswing and you kind of
link a downswing to certain behavior you
see in certain hands actually there is
one um
that when listening or not
uh he plays so tight
and he's holding a lot he's bluffing
less and there's another one that when i
don't know what happens to everyone he's
one of the best but
um
sometimes he's playing like so crazy
like so speedy
you know so he's playing you know when
you play high stakes and you you are
very good player
back tracks you know but regulars
or when they are not playing well
they are like semi fish some kind of
so you are you have to
[Music]
something like that some kind of you
have to
hunting
because the 5k plus there's not too many
tables you have to you have to battle a
lot so basically you're hunting you're
hunting you're you're trying to spot
players who are off their center and
then you hunt them
i think
no um not like a not like a fish but if
i'm better my a-game
and i don't have tables
if i somebody has three tables for
tables so i add them you know i i had
that table yeah you add because that
player currently is out of the center
basically yeah and you know when you are
playing high stakes you have to
fight for the king of the hill like uh
you have to sit down because it's not so
difficult there's a lot of scripts and
uh people is so fast or so difficult to
get tables um
so if he's this this regular is not
playing very well i'm gonna play very
good i know i know he has this problem
now
so i fight i battle there and try to
have fun because actually i do that
because i have fun
because i
bet actually i saw i like i love to be
competitive
so when i'm competitive so i try to i
like to play
sorry for hijacking your conversation
adam
all good i was actually going to pass it
over to you right now and ask you uh in
your career did you have big deviations
in your asp game based on your emotional
state did you go through any periods
where there was like a big divide
between those those two states
well it was actually funny
jose described a player who's in a
downswing who becomes a bit more nitty
that's me like if i'm in a downswing i
guess my default response is i want to
be safe and then in my head save is
related to be making more faults and
bluffing less which actually is it and
this is really funny like your body is
then trying to keep your safe your mind
well however you want to call it it's
trying to keep you safe but it's
actually not keeping you safe because
it's making you play more passive which
is not more plus a fee you're i would
avoid
bigger pots i was actually this is a
natural tendency of me
maybe we should book a call adam uh
you could you you could diagnose it
maybe but you know i'm i'm just as jose
i'm very observative and i notice all my
le all my leaks are around passivity and
i've noticed the tendency that if i can
take a line that would
make the pot smaller i would prefer that
line like my natural bias leans towards
passive lines so instead of for betting
i would prefer calling the three bet
okay with hands that can do either way
every time when it's either way oh if
this is a better check i'll lean towards
the passive option which i think comes
from a tendency to try to keep the pot
small because i see a bigger pot more as
an opportunity to lose instead of to win
so this is my this is my current soul
searching and try trying to always like
this is something that i always always
try to find what are the root cause of
some of the leaks and i started to list
like some of my leaks and i was like
wait this is a returning pattern i'm
trying to play my returning pattern this
is true actually through all my life uh
my c game reverts to passivity so in
order to be aggressive i have to really
focus
and that that bias or that c game get
enhanced when i'm in a downswing which
makes sense but it doesn't make sense
right
that happened to me same same my my bias
is to go to the positive
and when i'm in the upswing actually i
do the opposite i don't mind calling off
a stack i don't mind bluffing of a stack
it's like
yeah
enough money problems you know it's like
ah if i lose this one there okay sorry
if i block this one uh who cares that's
not right i think what happens for
maybe
yeah but but but it's important i'm sure
there's some people listening it like oh
so for the audience listening i'm gonna
ask you a question like what are your
tendencies when you're in a downswing
what are your tendencies when you're in
an upswing what are your sea game
tendencies what are your current leaks
and a lot of players they cannot answer
these questions and in my opinion that's
that's a tell you're not work for
example if you ask me now i can give you
a detailed report of all my leaks okay
that i'm very much aware of uh and even
plans on how to fix them okay
obviously when i'm playing it doesn't
always automatically come out but i am
observative and then when i see i indeed
make the format instead of calling the
three bet i'm like good you know
reinforce that behavior this is good
also trying to understand the logic i
think
the pu uh i think this is no secret the
poo has a natural tendency to three bet
two less from the big blind right yeah
especially because a lot of hands i
think this is the perfect example
pick this perfect example because
calling is such an easy alternative and
a lot of hands are pretty
okay they're like okay yeah but this
hand's so pretty if i three bet any four
forwards i have to fold right that that
is a waste the flaw here though is they
one they overestimate the ev of calling
right if you three bat and
in general in poker there's no higher
evie situation
to get yourself in than to have your
opponent fault unless you have aces
kings queens maybe ace king but maybe i
think a lot of spots even ace king it's
hard to outperform a fault
so if you then do three bet from the big
blind
and they do get four bet they kind of
overestimate
the ev of worst case scenario so oh then
i have to fold so that's like the mental
flaw behind not tree betting enough so
every time for example same with for
betting out of position same with
rebelling from the big blind
you have to realize that
the hands don't make as much money as
you think in the call that's one
and that you're three betting or
forbidding the pretty hands just in case
you get called that you still have
decent amount of equity okay but that's
kind of the the mental game and people
don't often see this as a mental game
flaw but it is a mental game leakage
enough from the big bang two not four
but enough out of position with linear
hands okay so i try to remind myself and
at some point when you just when it just
clicks
you have no more problem the leak is
over
okay at the beginning it's conscious but
you have to really reinforce that point
and then at some point it's normal it
clicked for you right
yeah
when i realized
what you said i realized that like a few
months ago the i realized
why people do that why the people have
um know enough through it in bbe because
what you said
then i thought about the river you know
they're in the river um people don't
when they have a blue catch they can win
the pot sometimes when they call
but
they try they call more than race
so for that
most of the time
is under black the rice river realized
no because again with the alternative
right the alternative calling is an
attractive option
also we often just when we get into a
spot with a bluff catcher
we
the natural question we ask ourselves is
ooh can we call this that's the first
question and then basically the race
option is kind of
because of the question we ask ourselves
the race didn't come into our mind
unless
we have strong
card removal purposes that makes it
trigger like oh my face is bad i have
fourth pair with the ace flush blocker
uh
this triggers like hey i blocked the
nuts hey i have a bluff catcher but i
have a great blocker to bluff with then
that's a scenario where people
naturally find the bluffs right but what
if there is no natural hand that
triggers you from bluff racing
like you said the marginal hands or the
hands that maybe can could call
you know you call you don't pray so um
um
i say something important now
yeah so um
humans when you play poker you have
seconds to make a decision
seconds
so
usually people
you know it's like uh
make always go for the
uh passive tendency if they if they
think about that you know what i mean i
would say i would say for your natural
tendency so if someone is naturally
passive or someone is naturally
aggressive they will always lean their
decision towards their natural bias
that's why in general you you just you
you have passive players and they're
going to be passives and you have
aggressive players they're going to be
aggressive sure one day he's going to be
less aggressive than his most aggressive
right if he's out of center but in
general in my opinion when you've
labeled a guy as just like listen you
just like to fight for pots they just
cannot help themselves they will fight
for the pot
they in day out i remember i remember a
good friend of mine retired poker player
now he always made post so simple he
said listen it's quite simple
when you're a folder and you wake up you
get out of bed you're not like today
i'm not gonna fault anymore no you're
like i'm a folder i'm gonna sit down
play poker and today i'm going to fall
that's what a folder does and the same
with the station the station is not
going to wake up but it better be like
today i'm not gonna be a station maybe
okay maybe he has the intention but one
hour in his session he will revert to
his natural tendencies and station the
[ __ ] out of people because you know when
he faces a bet on the river he's like
hmm what are his bluffs i can find some
bluffs yeah you can always find bluffs
you know if if yeah yeah or if you're a
natural curious person you're gonna be
like i can find some bluffs here whereas
the passive guy is like i can find some
value bets here and based on that
question the result is one keeps on
calling one hypsophobic
yeah
always you can find that you can
be so creative you can um
invent it invent
many hands that
they that are not there i mean
that hand are not there and people say
they have this this but mate
that hands are not in that spot
you know
people think they are making a
calculated decision but all they're
usually doing is just to find a
justification for their bias okay i'm
now i'm a calling station i'm gonna find
a reason to call here and they actually
think that they're making a rational
decision but all they're doing is trying
to find the information that leads to a
call and it has to be
a very minus
v call for them to not find any reasons
to do so
yeah when someone when someone calling a
station starts to think
he's going to call i think
he'll be excused he just has
he just hasn't found the reason yet but
if you give him five seconds
so in your opinion a long time bank
beneficial or not beneficial
um
[Music]
i think
for me so it's good
uh for me it's good because i can play
more tables
you know
um but in terms of your decision you you
said like the longer you can think the
more you will
lean towards your your bias
for the uh
for the population i think it's bad but
for the for someone who
is
conscious of this um the thing is is
good
yeah i think that's a very good point i
completely agree actually i wanted to
touch on an interesting point that uh
that you when you you and adam were
talking about as well that that you said
adam that
you have clients who come to you and
it's almost like through the words you
kind of
hear the wish that they want to be a
robot
when i was doing a session with my
therapist she actually pointed me out on
that she said like okay so what you're
basically saying is that you don't want
to be human and what you're describing
is that your perception of other
high-sex poker players is that they're
not very human he said she says make be
very careful what you wish for here i
thought that was a very interesting
point like okay
and also that touches on a point about
the the emotional person let's say jose
described himself as a very emotional
person
if that's
you
and you're gonna try to suppress your
emotions because you think suppressing
your emotions in poker will lead you to
make better poker decisions which you
know we can make an argument to some
degree can be true you might win more
money in poker but i don't think it will
make you a happier person as you know as
jose put it you will be out of center in
terms of out of touch i would say in
this case with who you truly are
um
i think
poker and life
they're so similar and um
answering to adam or both
for me it's a big tool
it's the the best tool i have to grow
to grow because
like when you play poker
it's like a
life but
faster like you get a lot of uh
challenging that you get in life but
life's work slowly
yeah yeah
yeah so
um for me uh it's important to be like a
robot playing poker
but
it's a role you know it's a role you
have to be confused there
but after that when you go to life you
have to
be able to
to
take like a distance from that
that's so difficult that's so difficult
yeah i was going to say that do you have
like some sort of a post-session routine
to to get back in touch with your
emotional self um no because um
it's like actually people who doesn't
know me um they only know me because i
play against them
they
i think they make a image from me so
different that what we are what we i
really are i really am
you know it's like a uh ice
in in the tables i like a devil
like i try to be like a devil you know
like a
maybe it's a
and then in life i i pure love
so
but um i'm working on that
too
when i'm playing in the table because um
uh
you have to be like a little bit careful
like you said you know like
sometimes
because i'm
i don't know
i'm a different person playing poker me
technically i do my i do my best i try
to
earn i had to win all the times
but
i this saw the i mean this completely
sep uh separate
from what i am
i like like um like a person like you
know when i play poker if i have against
a casino on the table
you know i i'm gonna be talking with him
like i really want to be uh i really
want to him
i really want he to be happy
but of course
i'm playing poker so
i want i'm going to win the hands but
anyway but you know so
you know what i mean it's a bit of a
conflict because on one hand you want
him to be happy but on the other hand
you do want to take his money so you
have to take his money without hurting
his feelings how do you do that jose
give us something yes
simple yeah that's a conflict with uh i
had what happened
i didn't i don't play live
but when i play lives
it's difficult for me you know because
i see
of course against
occasionals
they lose a lot of money i said my god
and then
he's gonna be sad or maybe he has a
problem
wow so
that
that's
that
doesn't happen to me when i play online
because it's like a
different way it's for example i love
animals i love animals
um
in the future i want to be a vegetarian
person
but i love meat but when i see a meat i
don't see animal because in my in my in
my brain
it doesn't look like iron you know it's
like a
but if you give me animals and kill him
to eat
i cannot i i'm gonna
starve
i'm gonna be i'm gonna
kill him i don't even kill a
it doesn't even look alike so if let's
say for example you would eat a piece of
meat but let's say for example they put
a pork on the table grilled with the hat
still on it then you don't eat it
because that's what i have as long as
it's
so with with any animal products as long
as i don't see eyes hats claws tank
what are the ten tentacles blooding
around then i'll eat it it shouldn't
look like an animal anymore
yeah actually look uh
the sample you said uh if he's
already dead of course it's gonna be
harder but i i remember i don't know now
but remember in the past when i was
living in thailand
um
[Music]
uh
my girlfriend was thai so i went to his
um
native town so his
natal town right
and you know there's like um
europe like
60 years ago maybe so
a small village so
they bring you know like that see they
bring
the the the fork the head
in that moment i could you know i could
now
i don't know i even ate
i even try a dog
you know so i'm curious okay so
okay let's see you know
so now i don't know but of course
uh it's harder than when you only see us
take
oh you know
oh whatever that anyway
uh
at some point in my life before i'm
gonna work on that um
try to go to the vegetarian side because
it's more
important
with me with my with me with my
consciousness yeah with your person that
makes sense i think i think life by the
way in terms of recreations losing money
to you i think there's a lot of
recreationals that first of all you they
don't really mind losing money as you
said they are there to have a good time
and i feel like if you gave him a good
time at the table you know you're
chatting with him you're having fun and
then he ends up losing the money to you
it doesn't really matter or at least
that's often with some recreations that
i have they liked you you know and they
were like they they might even call you
like listen i know you have but here you
go you know that's like yeah if you if
you've entertainment well he doesn't
really mind losing his money to you so
all you can do is try to be a nice nice
guy at the table that yeah i think if he
loses yeah higher you play
more uh that more happen yeah true
because because there also people come
to gamble with the money that they
actually have whereas maybe on lower
stakes people are just there with their
salary
and in general okay i have to be careful
to say no but let's say for example
someone has more money or any earned
that money he has also developed certain
characteristic traits
and
therefore he will take losing in a
better way maybe throughout accumulating
his fortune he has already faced more
adversity that someone who just earns
paycheck to paycheck and puts his whole
paycheck on the line if you understand
what i mean probably that also has
something to do with it i wanted to
touch on the point that you that you
also mentioned when you saw how hard
poker is nowadays right and you look to
the high stakes and it's so difficult
you mentioned that you feel motivated
now
obviously this is just based on an
interpretation
you think
why do you think it feels motivating to
you seeing how hard
poker is and how much work you still
have to do instead of feeling
discouraged by it what do you think is
the difference because some people would
be like ah why is it so much work why is
so difficult i just want to win come on
let's get it over with why can poker
just be easy and you were like you
appreciate that you talked about
accepting the reality reality is that's
very difficult and you can appreciate it
and it motivates you
why what's the difference
uh difficult things in life can you
give you like a more uh
how do you say that the easy things
in short time it's okay like it's like a
present but you go to you eat a doritos
okay you get a good feeling for five
seconds one minute but when you finish
the back it's like in a while oh i feel
bad why i did that but but when you go
for a diet the short time is like
but the long term you feel so good so
when something is difficult give you
better finish
uh
than when something is easy and
when something is is is boring when you
play a game
and you
um
get a game you get the game you pass the
game how you can you
get you win
the win
um
it's easy it's boring
yeah it's also
on short term it might be nice like oh i
won but then if you every time win
because that's easy it's not so
satisfying it's not challenging for me i
like challenge and for example i love
surf i like i love surfing star from
poker i think i don't know but the more
most difficult things i ever did so
it's like taking me a lot of time a lot
of effort um
um
i need to make i need a lot of energy to
to
to be good um day by day it's like a
long way you know long way uh process
that and uh it's funny it's if not it's
like life you know life is the
more difficult game that you can play
life is a game
but it's so difficult why so difficult
because so difficult you can play for
long for many years if the life was easy
now what it's easy okay okay so
oh you know what i do now
and there is two kind of persons
the person who um
work on the challenge and
put a lot of energy in the challenge and
walk walk walk and another one week
no and in life that this i have to be
careful with this too so so carefully
sorry if someone is uh take it
personally um i'm not sure about this
okay so um for example when sang was
suicide
he quickly the game because
so hard for them
or whatever or they they think i don't
know what they think what they're saying
suicide okay so but
they think it's the best choice the best
the best they can do you know they
cannot
in that moment so um but
you know i don't know what you
understand my point something no and i
understand your point
um
it's it's one point that's very
important that i heard you mention you
reset the word process and i think this
is really a big difference betw because
throughout the conversation it's very
clear that you're very happy with your
life and in order i think to feel
motivated by life being challenging you
have to be very content and happy with
your current life because if you're not
happy with where you currently are you
want things to change rapidly and then
something to be easy is often the desire
because you can change your current life
very easily let's say high sex poker has
now suddenly become easily and you have
some financial problems you want to get
out of it you hopings are easy right
because you just want to you want to get
to a different place you want to feel in
a different way than you're currently
feeling and if the road is easy you can
feel that way tomorrow so i think very
key point here is that you can only
interpret this as motivating if you're
very happy with where you are now and
this is also the only way you can enjoy
the process right and this is i think in
any book in any mental game coaching
session you will hear this enjoy the
process right and just just surrender to
the process and don't want the results
tomorrow
uh
this is i think the key in order to feel
the way that you are feeding and to
interpret it as motivating would you
agree
and
i think it's important and working on
that now it's like when things are going
good
it's fine it's easy to be happy or easy
to be
um they're happy with your life when
eating eating is uh things are going uh
no good okay i don't like to say that
because nothing's bad not good enough
um
[Music]
you have to
like um
enjoy that too see
if your presence is you're human
enjoy the process
it's another way that you have to go
because it's life is human so
it's important for me i'm working on
be good with myself in the heights and
being good with myself in the dance
because they cannot exist one without
another
yeah you have to accept life basically
it's so difficult yeah and for when you
are in a downswing
perspective
is opportunity
grow
cows you see you think about the
universe cows is
creation
dark is creation people i think i
understand but the cows and the in the
dark i think they understand i i
understand that different ways it causes
darkness it's a creation energy
and light
is the energy that
when you create something
um grow the what you know what you
create
already but yeah because we
we notice that it's dark because
sometimes it's light we might appreciate
that it's light because sometimes it's
dark that's what you're trying to say
one one kind of one kind of strengthens
the other
is creation so when you go in a house in
a downstream it's opportunity to try to
set to work on your game so you are
creating a new aspect
okay you are going to realize since you
are doing that so you are creating other
perspectives you are creating something
and then when you realize that
now you need time to
uh
interiorized
yeah until you reach that so it's like a
one first creation
then like
you understand yes you know you are
human and you're gonna go with uh light
spirits and dark fields but both are
good are fine because both are important
to growth
yeah and a crucial part is something
that you also mentioned except reality
right all frustration exists in us
fighting against reality but the reality
is you're in a downswing better to look
at the opportunity which is to lose less
than your competitors boot in the same
downswing and to try to develop yourself
as a player for example right so having
an up having an opportunity based
mindset looking at any situation okay
what's the current opportunity what are
the current lessons that
uh my environment is trying to teach me
right and you have to it's funny because
you have to learn them you can fight
against that reality but at some point
the reality keeps on bumping in your
face like listen i'm trying to teach you
something you have to learn this because
else the reality is not going to change
yeah suddenly if you don't change that
it's going to be again okay again again
i'm going to show you did you know that
did you learn that
you know yeah oh you have to learn that
else we won't change reality for you
that's kind of part of the game right
that's that's the game
that's one of the games you know i'm
going to show you this and did you
understand if you don't understand then
i'm going to show you again again again
again that's a booklet that's live

um
there are a few last week i think i
think that's a week or two weeks ago i
have a
small uh
um
greece's assistantship this is existence
here
like uh
um
took me to go out from that
few hours why because i said okay
um
i get two ducks because i think
in what makes sense in life what i'm
gonna do while i'm here
so
to go out from towards from there
i went to
be present man you only have the present
you only have present the present and
then you are alive
so
you are alive
and you enjoying you have to you are in
the present and you are alive so what
you want
there's nothing else so keep going
so
you you you clearly have gained a lot of
knowledge that's quite clear right in
talking to you so far
on basically
how to live your life you already
mentioned multiple books uh you also
mentioned that you often look
out for coaches to improve you
mentioned
[Music]
raoul you also mentioned joining educa
do you still remember
some of the big aha moments that
made something click for you that helped
you progress to a new level in in your
poker game
um that you had at that period with
raoul or when joining educa what were
some of the moments they were like wow
now it clicked and that could help you
progress at for example a higher stake
or increase your win rate
um
[Music]
actually uh you know that's the
last
six months that's the last six months
i've been playing carmen
and i went there
because i knew
there were the
best uh spanish poker player in the
world now you know that's nacho david
jones
spatula
so um i went there because it's like you
said you asked me about bedo i'm wrong
but this is the same okay i went there
to
create a b a
link
you know a human link with their chair
talk with them right so um
they give me they gave me a lot of
clicks
in the game because they understand
talking talking they understand things
in the game that i didn't understand
before
no about uh so
um
i got a lot of uh
click
but um they're like a
[Music]
tech about technique about uh theory
about uh how to apply theory to humans
you know
so i don't know as in if this work for
you like uh i got click
with them talking with them sharing with
them um
i was so lucky because um they wouldn't
they wanted to charge and
i'm like i have um
i i like it i lucky because
people like me you know people i mean
so i it's easier for me to to
to
uh to create a link and they uh opened
you know
you think oh that's crazy i mean i've
been playing with david jones and nacho
every day
but entitles and they share i mean they
share i mean they don't study together
but they share uh we talk about hands
they they don't we share concepts um
that that's that is crazy right but
for me it's important i think um
when you give something
you uh
get something better gotten nobody but
you get more uh as much as you give a
lot
you get a lot
yeah
and some people don't think about it
even
this happened in poker say oh i know
when i share with you because we play
together how many guns how many has we
played together um
how many hands maybe
10 hands
and how many hands do you play against
the rest so yeah
if we
exchange information
of course maybe it's gonna be you're
gonna do our play harder or you're gonna
win less against me or whatever but
you're gonna win
in general you're gonna win a lot more
because you are playing there
99 of the hands with the rest
yeah
and also and also in order to
receive you also have to give right
that's also what you're saying for
example you're talking about how you
learned a lot by talking with nacho
david jones but i'm sure let's say for
example they gave you 80 information but
i'm sure they've received at least 20
information back that else they would
not have received you probably like i
said you perceive them maybe as better
players maybe they are better players so
you were the one maybe benefiting more
but then again they would not have
received the information you gave them
without opening up to you exactly yeah
and probably and probably they got there
they are to where they are today because
they have that sharing mentality
maybe maybe a lot of players who are
listening who are at way lower stakes
they're very uh very uh
how do you say that very paranoid about
sharing
and maybe therefore they are stagnating
there
right whereas if they would share they
might have received great advice that
would help them get unstuck to where
they currently are
i i think you are in a high level on
that
you play high stakes uh high stakes they
know
there are
we are not too many
um you show how you play to 1k2k i think
i cannot do that for example for me it's
like a paranoia about that you know but
you are a highlight of that i i actually
i i um i would like to know you know how
you deal with that or oh because
of course i share but i don't share like
that's like a source
when you play
you battle and you play like 5k against
them and they see how you sing or like
okay man i think it's amazing i think
it's amazing um
for me like i told you it's like a wow
um
but how you deal with that now halloween
i'm doing the podcast to you
yeah but like
so there's obviously
so for example when when i make a when i
make a youtube video when i stream or
whatever
uh that goes public
obviously
you will
for example you can you can say a lot of
things in poker and still say nothing
right
i can ramble on about how this hand
blocks this how this hand unblocks this
how
uh you know at a certain frequency i
will do this you can say a lot of smart
things and in the end still not really
be sharing that much valuable
information you know maybe against jose
i have a hand that out it's a bluff
catcher and i'm like jose crazy out of
the center i will just always call uh
and then on on the stream i say okay i
roll now oh i rolled high so this time i
called an example right
and like
i don't trust this i don't trust what's
going on my spidey senses say i have to
call here that's something different
than like i'm explaining my whole
thought process of why i think this
leads to an overblown spot for example
yeah so yeah when you say sharing for
example when i make a video on youtube i
try to
share enough where the video was
valuable
but and probably the same if you talk
with jose uh with if david jones talks
with jose and he has three specific
reads on you that makes him a lot of
money he's not going to share those
reach with you because it doesn't
benefit you
it only hurts him right
for example i did a lot of
it was in the same situation where i
would play a lot against players that i
would also study with and we would just
agree listen if you have a very specific
read on me and you don't think other
players are exploiting that just keep it
to yourself but overall we can talk
hands that's not a problem
so
yeah that that uh
i know for me it's like i i of course
i thought about that when what you said
about playing when you played youtube
yeah because actually you see another
youtubers or whatever uh they always are
rolling
yeah but this is very okay so actually i
wanted to ask this question a bit later
but i will ask joe you you you joined
educa and i know that a lot of the
spanish guys that play high stakes they
basically all came to through a duca
poker right it's definitely a talent
hotbed it produced a lot of great poker
minds
uh i don't think rolling dice is part of
the coaching philosophy at educa poker
could you maybe share us a little bit
with
like cheryl's what the philosophy
of teaching is at educa poker and why do
you think it created so much high stakes
and bosses
one of the most difficult thing in pogba
is how i've learned to exploit
um
news so
his poker is based on exploited
exploited moves and play behind
like if the hand was last
so that work that's so difficult to
learn and
it works very good in low stakes and mid
stakes
was
the best
the best uh sit and go
poker player in
the world
[Music]
when the supernaval league
so um it was crazy because he was the
first and he doubled the win rate to the
second it's like i was crazy you know
wow
crazy
um but
uh so vedos the hakkas
pablo tenneses
um
they
me
uh
we
when we achieved two high stakes
we had to go out from that we have to
grow out a robot from this productive
way learn the theory
and then
go back to the explorative way
so
like
we born from exploitation that's so
difficult to learn
that works a lot until high stakes in
high state you have to learn how to
replace theory and then
you don't crash i mean you don't um
if you only play sorry you are not going
to you are going to be okay
you know maybe
one baby i know
you know i don't know but but beetle
told me once if you want to crash you
have to know theory a lot and you have
to know how to explode exploit theory
how to spread human that's what make
them uh crucial
both
so
the philosophy of
occur and the program in the school
uh there is like a
past
and present and fusion okay
in the past raul was the head coach
now the head coach is addressing
you know he his name in
progress is uh
okay so and now in the
[Music]
uh do you know the schools are are many
levels in school like it's like a
school a quarterly um
gardening
school
uh university uh
doctor um
you know like a men's school so
the
in the in the in the high of the school
in the the highest stage
we um are addressed stylism he play he
knows theory
and exploitative
me
we play theory and exploitative
uh person versus reigns brian's in
pokerstar he he played a lot of story
actually he learned from
machado
in the school
and then another another like my
question then he know theory and
exploitative so
now
the president of the school is sayori
and exploitative but from mistake to
up
yeah because
because as you mentioned you were trying
to
shot 2k over over but it kept on not
working and that was because you were
purely exploitative and you lacked
theoretical knowledge what was could you
maybe give us an example of an aha
moment you had when you for example
started to work more with piyo right you
mentioned working with solvers what was
like an aha moment that you had
that you were like oh [ __ ] yeah i was
doing this completely wrong now now i
completely
uh have a different perspective and now
i can crush 2k do you remember one of
the big aha moments you had where it
really clicked for you
[Music]
the biggest mistake was memorize
and not understand
i learned in the school to memorize
not to understand what they are what
what are the main ideas
uh for example saying when you read a
book
i was reading like i don't want to i
want to read every word uh because if i
don't read every word i'm gonna lose i'm
gonna lose information wherever but when
you read the book you have to look for
the main ideas and
the re the whole book is write down uh
around their main ideas and maybe the
main these are two three four you know
and to have 400 page so i i would bio i
understand this i understand that i
don't have to memorize i have to
understand the ideas
and when you understand the ideas you
have to write down the ideas and
um
develop the idea writing down every
concept
and so
i think that was the change the big
change for me
the uh change
my
how to learn because i wasn't i didn't
know how to learn because i didn't i i
learned
wrong in the school
yeah okay so a big part of it was also
unlearning but also i would say because
educa educa poker was there before
sulfur so just as ever every other poker
school that was there before solvers
they also had to develop
with the solver age right
also for example i was purely exploitive
player as well
and i had the same
process as you i started to work with
solvers and that really certain
theoretical concepts started to click i
always looked a lot at other players as
well so i wasn't necessarily that much
of a solver user but
if you play against linus frequently for
example and you take a look at what he's
doing and all the better players around
you they are using a lot of solvers so
you would suddenly see them use certain
strategies that clearly came from the
solver and even though i wasn't
necessarily using the solver that much
myself i would think like
interesting they're starting to use
these strategies what are these
strategies trying to accomplish and with
that i was sort of indirectly studying a
solver
yeah and i think uh even if they are not
using fire
for example
when we start when we study the river
for me it's the most exploitative
[Music]
street
nowadays
they all
where i may be mainly exploited on the
river
so but if they don't use pio and you
uh look
on fire and just you
you you see that you have to call this
hand to decision and they are so far
from that
actually doesn't matter if they are
studying or not because you can exploit
them like fluffing a lot or not bluffing
enough blasphemy because they're calling
more than pie can you say what i mean
yeah so i think it's a good tool to
that and
for me like i'm so emotional so to be
like uh
on my center because if i lose a lot in
my strategic game before when i have a
downsweep i don't know what i was doing
and how i can know how i'm how i can
check how can can i find out
if i'm wrong or bad you know it's like a
feeling of the building ah
i start you know
about you know so when you
have a downsweet and you have fire that
you know how to work with fire and you
go today and then you
check bio and you do have laughs and he
called with that hand that you know it
doesn't matter because he has doesn't
matter that happens biohave to go with
that
you know so but if he's calling with a
hundred you don't expect oh it's not all
they call more or they call more
actually because no you don't see that
um then you have you can learn okay so
this guy
is calling here more than five so you
have to be left left uh less and
okay i'm gonna pay attention because
this guy is doing this maybe other guys
are doing that too yeah so and it's not
necessarily like oh he is a calling
station but asking yourself a deeper
question like hey what is it about this
specific spot because for example i
think most most interesting when i have
a guy that i think is more of a folder
and then he suddenly calls a hand that
he should definitely never call i'm like
what made a folder lead to call and this
spot like even folders they find spots
to hero call right so then it's like
okay what is it about this spot
specifically that made and hero folder
making hero call you can actually learn
a lot from that yeah and when you if you
pay attention
uh uh
the best player of the world like
uh stefan uh bison fish for me is
one of the best two
um david jones
they
sometimes play hands so far from fire
because they understand that that's what
maybe you are overwriting like crazy
yeah you know but
for me it's important one thing it's
important because when you're playing
against high sticker they get there for
something so
don't kill the chicken
don't kill the chicken thank you for
that that's amazing
that sounds like crazy so don't kill the
the eggs the whole oh you said that
don't kill the
the
gold eggs from the chicken right you say
that i'm saying yeah yeah
okay i know you are horror blasting but
i don't want i don't want you to realize
that i know you're autographing so yeah
for example estefan makes crazy moves
that they show up his game a lot and
when you're playing with this high
staker
it's so easy to
um
exploit back strike yes right back
you don't and you
maybe take a long time for you to
realize that you i'm over um
striking back right so for me it's
important to
exploit i love that over over profit
over bluff spot or whatever but
be like uh don't be ambitious see
ambitious is a very dangerous weapon
crazy because a lot of highest taker
that
because of of ambition ambition
they
make a lot of mistakes
you know it's like uh okay i can win
here
in this hand 100
i don't know 100 chips
but only one time and maybe then in the
future because he saw you you
you approached
they strike you back so okay so you have
to be like uh
you say that like uh and you sent i
don't know how you say two okay i'm not
gonna win i'm gonna i'm not going to
wear 100 shift i'm going to hurt 60 but
for a long time like a long time
thinking process
yeah so
what what you're basically ascribing is
let's say for example you've spotted a
big unbalance and therefore you can make
a big hero call that in this case makes
you for example 100 chips if he now
flips the exploit and bluffs zero that
spot next time and you still make the
same call you lose your 100 back whereas
if you go for sort of more of a soft
exploit you call a little bit more with
you know a frequency hand and you make
30 chips but he will not realize that
you've exploited so he will not change
his game so you win 30 chips in the
future 30 chips 30 chips 30 chips that's
long-term thinking process that's
working business business like that when
people think about business in the short
term
i think it's not going to be good you
can be good for a few months but then
people i mean it's it's not going to
work um so here i think it's important
to be conscious about don't try don't
kill the the spot
you know be like a slug it's like this
you have to be
this uh discipline uh you have to this
you have to show this sibling
yeah i think that's so important and
like you said when i have a
uh
i support that i know you're over
bluffing i always choose a hand that
feel pain with frequency
yeah because this way you in high stakes
all of us work with players so um
so you don't know what i'm doing i think
of course now i told you so if you look
play against me i i i i know i'm not
rolling mate i'm not rolling okay i mean
no yeah if if you call a bluff catcher
you call it always and if you fall yeah
i don't know what you're folding but if
you call a bluff catcher that's marginal
to say at least you're probably gonna
call always the bluff catcher in that
spot but you're not gonna expand to a
hand that's just never a thing because
that will send the alarm bells off yeah
of course sometimes against very good
very very good players i roll sometimes
because i don't know what to do
but yeah and also also i think rolling
can be
beneficial to if you really don't know
what to do
and then if you don't roll you always
fall back to your bias so for example in
my case that would always be folding
sadly
um of course when i
finish the session
for i go to that spot i'm trying to find
out what they have to do next the next
time yeah
if not
it's always saying and you don't grow up
that's important
so so we talked now a lot about how
theory kind of helped your game but as
many players i'm sure when you started
to try to start to implement theory
in the beginning it can kind of also
hurt your game were there some
mistakes you made because you said like
you know trying to implement theory
certain things work because you know a
solver is playing against a solver but
you're also playing against humans was
there a time for a short period where
your game actually went backwards when
starting to try to implement theory
uh
i want to i want to answer maybe i don't
know if you answer interesting
request uh you ask me this but uh when
people say with low stakes uh players
i think
it's better if they don't use if they
don't use fire i see for me the most
important thing poker is to know how to
to learn how to play against the
customers because the money is from
there from them
be focused on this most important thing
or learn how to play against them and
then
make uh build a simplified strategy then
don't
uh that
uh avoid mistakes to beginners no very
because
this simplify a lot don't avoid mistakes
the most important thing because like i
said i told you when i have like uh
this about
200 2400
bbs lost
there was some mistakes
so i am i make some mistakes
you know like this one
um
not so frequently you know but they are
making these mistakes all the time
so it's impossible to learn from them so
make a simplified
robot like a robot strategy like i do
did it on the map and played learned how
to play
against kashmir and of course your table
has to be good you are playing no limit
to 25 50. you have to be
playing against a
70 you know 70 vpip
every table maybe you cannot play
against a 30
vip vpip because the rate is insane and
you know
the biggest mistakes people
that
humans want to humans
feel that complex is better
that is usually it's not like that
complex is worse
uh at least until
you are very good on that if you are
like us you know it's like
if you really understand it because if
you truly understand it it's no longer
complex like you cannot execute what you
don't understand so if you have a
complicated strategy that you don't
understand it's going to go very very
badly yeah and poker is so complex it's
so difficult it's crazy
yeah you you can set your own parameters
you can
like in poker you can there's many ways
to play sort of correct right you can
use many sizings uh
uh
just find the right hands right
frequency with the sizing that you
decide to use and choose a sizing that
makes sense for you intuitively so
the chances of you making big blunders
is smaller right yeah
sometimes i use bio with them but only
to show
see i ain't good visualizing you know
when you see the brain yeah
so that's good because i'm good with
visualize uh with my eyes so when you
look that they can understand a little
bit more but
always from the
the basic things the
from the beginning approach okay okay
you have to do this do this do this do
that but look at this how it looks
but do this because this
i explain how to because you do that
always and i i try to use a lot not
looking with them because for example i
think um
[Music]
why is good to do for a beginner a cv
range
one side of the pot all the time don't
think about the spot to do that and then
let's let's work on the term on the
river
because
people is overfolding and people is
under raising the series so
what so you are materialistic you are um
is the equity realization concept
you know if you for one third of the pot
you get until the river the night is
five percent of the time so may it's
even it's impossible that you
develop a strategy better than this
for a beginner
so difficult for example you know
then when do you say okay now it's time
to
uh kind of explain you
poker at a deeper level
when when is the right time then because
i'm sure a lot of players are listening
they you understand this is like one of
the basic things they learn okay
and this is true like in general if you
just see that one third on most ports
and then at boards where
less c betting is happening you just
range check that's often a common used
way to kind of simplify
the flop tree and then from there you
start to think
sort of right yes
when do we start to ask when do we start
to
enter
until no limit it's like uh and wait
until
uh one limit to 100 or 200 i mean you
have to do these basic
strategies
and be focused on customer players
uh when you get when you are
professional already
when you get leave from poker and you
can and then um you are 100 i think
for me 200 i think 100 i see level 1 is
for example 100 range every spot
okay level 2 i think maybe 100 when you
are a solid
solid winner in 100 i am gonna do i'm
going to split the flop in two
strategies 100 or 100 check
yeah yeah
and then the third when you are already
playing
401k then you can start to uh
make bottom flop in this four um then
you can have uh
overweight and turn on sometimes um
two sizing on time you know it's like a
but i think
until you are not professional
it's important to get to professional as
faster as you can
and avoid mistakes
and learning how to
make a good table select selection
um
i think that that that is important
always right
yeah always but
they don't know about people there's
amazing they don't do that
i mean
i say
school uh teaching people from
two not only
50 to 100 more or less now in
in my uh forum um and
maybe
how why do
the is always
always a mistake why do you play this
table
i told you 100 times do you have to play
this day what do you have better
but they are still making the same
mistakes
some pe some humans
are slower to learn but it's okay i mean
it's the matter is okay i'm here to
let you know again you know but like uh
be focusing a lot my energy and
let let them know to
this to don't play against
semi fishes so
semi-regressionals
try to avoid problems mistakes simplify
certain strategies
be focusing on latest stress when you
have a already a
win um
flop or strategy that
a winner flops ready yeah
i think it's also very important in
terms of when you tell someone to range
back a certain board that you try to
make him understand why
we can arrange bets so then they
naturally also understand when not to
range bad right and that is definitely
the difference in terms of how you said
that you learned strategy before versus
copying to trying to really find a
deeper
understanding right
also also i think often players use that
excuse of like yeah but i want to play
against better players so i can become a
better player but the truth is even if
you hunt for whales there were always
every table is usually made up of
there's a recreational there's someone
who's better than you there is a couple
of guys who are weaker than you at any
table you can find a challenge right
um
and again you know often if you cannot
find external challenges for a challenge
within yourself that's uh that's i think
a good advice that i would give players
that have trouble game selecting as well
from uh from my ego perspective adam why
do we like to play
tougher games
great question i'd say a few things one
we like to uh challenge ourselves in a
way we like to strive to be better and
very often playing tougher games gives
us the illusion that we are better at
what we do so uh if you pick a soft game
the ego can tell you that you're almost
like shine away from the fight also
imagine a school you avoid the bully and
you beat up some little kids it's like
yeah but you didn't go for the big one
whereas if you play tough games you get
validated that you're good at what you
do um also like there's a lot of
laziness as well in game selection some
players play big like pod games very
often it's because this comic bothers to
look for softer games so they dive into
these these hard ones so yeah there's a
few avenues and yes some players just
enjoy playing tough competition because
there's a lot you have the ego involved
in terms of they get a lot of validation
from those pursuits yeah i think it's
just exploring it yourself and
understand are you somebody who
generally plays games that are too tough
for you if you do play tough games
understand why you were doing that like
what is the reason you should be playing
tough games so you can learn so you can
learn from better players and evolve
your game i think some players will
delude themselves into thinking that
they play tough games for that reason
when in reality they should be playing
easier games more often and yeah
basically having higher win rates in the
game so yeah i think we all as poker
players have battles with the ego it's
one of those pursuits where you get into
poker because you enjoy games you're
competitive you want to win a poker and
go up the levels and yeah basically
you've got to keep your ego in check on
that pursuit you've got to know when to
take on challenges that are slightly
hard for you and other times when to
build your bankroll and be sensible i
think most players
are a work in progress when it comes to
their ego so yeah definitely a lot of
work done
all right i want to ask you about the
journeys to have taught a few times
about taking you 12 years to get to the
top i want to ask you a quick question
why do you think it didn't take you half
the amount of time i said see it took
you 12 years to get to where you are
you're a learner you like to grow you
like to improve you've surrounded
yourself with a lot of good players for
your career just sped it up why do you
feel like you didn't didn't take six
years to get to the top
now i didn't change anything because i
am
as i am what i am thanks to that
but
if i if i if i have to start a new um
new way and see a new project something
uh
i will be better in my commitment
i think i took two
12 years because i didn't have
commitment
um
that you know when i realized that
helped me a lot in my relationships
with my example with uh
your couple
a couple
it's amazing because
your couple is the
best
tool okay
to grow it's crazy it's a mirror it's
amazing mirror
but when you are a couple you have many
cows
many small cows
and humans always want to run away
you know so the commitment
with your couple
base is the most important thing with my
relationship with my couple is
i think
she has to be a good person
and she wants to be
in the right she's going to grow
that's two things she has these two
things i'm committing with the
relationships in uh in the way because
of course it's gonna be a lot of cows
and when you have a couch you're going
to run away
so the commitment and knowing
what you want is what is the most
important point in
your way is what gives you the
faster way more or less with a good
environment or
i i i explain what i mean you understand
what that means
100 yeah yeah makes perfect sense so
you're sitting there basically when you
committed to polka when you went all in
it decided right this is the path for me
all of a sudden the the kind of avenues
become a lot clearer and you can make a
lot more progress and then you're
linking that to your relationships as
well and your personal relationship when
you commit to that relationship you're
all in you're not on the fence when the
chaos comes when things get difficult
you don't shy away you try to find
resolutions and problem solve it and
yeah like i said it's the normal normal
human tendency when things get tough to
go to move away when you're committed
the commitment basically goes i'm here
no matter what i'm going to find a way
no matter what commitment in poca means
i'm going to find a way to get through
downswings i'll find a way to beat this
next level commitment in a relationship
means when something unfamiliar comes up
or someone brings it in security to the
surface you're there you sit with this
you have a conversation you work your
way through it so yeah i like that i
think it's uh i like that that's the
lesson you've learned along the way and
if you could go back like you said it's
almost like the things called the
butterfly effect where we don't change
anything because a butterfly flap this
wings in
sao paulo and that creates a hurricane
over let's say the world so there's a
kind of cause-and-effect relationship
that goes on so if you change one little
thing going back it might prevent you
from being where you are now but at the
same time we can play like a kind of
thought process game where like you i
like the way you did it you went if i
could put myself into a different
endeavor i would be more committed and
we're going to learn that way and
basically what you do differently yeah
things like a lot of things for you uh
sounds like the thing that's come up a
lot is perspective changing your
perspective so uh for you uh i think
maybe your meditations had a big part of
that you've been able to uh remove
yourself and kill the observer and not
be attached to your situations
for perspective tell me through like
what are some of the key perspectives do
you think are important for poker
players because i think you've talked
about a lot of them acceptance one of
them being able to uh yeah yeah a lot of
different avenues so for you could you
share some
important perspectives either about
polka or about life which you think are
helpful for aspiring poker players
i'm going to
go back to the another question
to the conclusions to be
clear in the conclusions um
you have when you are when you go in
into a
project like poker
you have to sit down and
write down why you are going in like i
said for example with my couple is uh
you have to be it's like a freedom you
know you don't lose to don't lose time
you have there is many things to do
many persons can go with you you know in
the past so you have
two things important write down because
we forget that such a big filter you
have to be a good person you have to be
have a good person with me with everyone
with herself
um
she she
has to want to grow up okay because she
wants to grow up she can achieve
everything as a matter only time okay so
with poker it's the same you sit down
you really see why you want to play
poker for example for me was i love the
game
i love in the beginning i love
competition
i i was
looking youtube like i said with high
stakes poker and i
cannot stop watching
uh i i um
so
uh podcast is gonna give me give me uh
um freedom a lot of freedom
you know so
sit down and and write down because when
there is a downsweet you have to go
there to read to read that and have the
commitment you know
it's like
you um
don't say it's how do you say that again
you have to write down that and when you
have a downstream workhouse
you go there to remember
why you are here
why you going to this i think that's the
for me the most important for poker
player
uh like in a mental way right
um
for me funny because often when you're
when
when [ __ ] hits the fan you ask actually
yourself that question why the [ __ ] am i
actually doing this but you're asking it
more because you don't know and what
you're basically not saying is you need
to know so when [ __ ] hits the fan you
have your no you can answer that
question that you ask out of
desperateness right when things are too
tough really good point really good
point very good point uh i think that's
life everything
and i i realized i realized this
a few months ago maybe
because um i have some
big conflict in my life with you know
relationship or whatever with feeling
like a
under love or underestimated something
like that so i said why i feel
like when i'm here right so okay so i'm
go i'm gonna write down
the things like i write down entirely
like sometimes poker is going first
sometimes life is going first but i use
both to grow up
um
so
that's important for me and
now what attached me to poker is that
like i love the game
uh give me see a poker game gives me an
amazing lifestyle
give me a lot of freedom i can be
everywhere do whatever i want
i can help people
so maybe i'm not a high stake poker
player but maybe i still for for a while
i i keep um
i stay for a while uh playing
1k 500 i don't know and
use this tool to help people because
when i play poker it's like a
time is gone it's like i'm so present
i play four hours four hour already it's
crazy you know the uh it's like time
doesn't exist when i play poker when i
study poker or when i uh involved in
poker so that's like a crazy so i'm so
lucky for that
so you have to love the game if you
don't love the game a lot of people come
to poker because the money because money
of course money for human being is uh
the first motivation
in the background
but you are not going to stay here
because of money because when you don't
when the cask came
you are going to quit because
money is not strong enough
now what do you think about this
very good yeah so i like you're
basically getting clear on your why
behind why you play poker and why you do
anything same with your relationships
what are they all about and for you it's
quite simple love love the game that's
why you play and the freedom that i can
create and then i liked what you were
saying about when things get tough use
that challenge as a way to recommit to
those things i recommit i play this game
because i love it i play this game
because it gives me freedom so when
things are getting the most chaotic and
things are the most challenging you've
got to remind yourself of the reason
you're showing up every day and like i
said most players will not know the
answer to those questions why do you
play it they'll have very superficial
answers like to make money to have
success to the eye sticks but it doesn't
really fuel them so for you loving the
game that's a that's an ongoing 12-year
love affair freedom that's something
that you've covered your life around be
able to do what you want so when things
get tough if you can remind yourself
with bigger reasons it's going to yeah
keep you up keep it going through
through challenging times so for you
like you said like i think what we're
saying throughout this conversation is
how much polka has helped you to grow
and even even when you talk about your
relationships you set one like the
qualities you really want and your
partner has a growth kind of mindset
someone can learn so for you uh when you
got into pocket 12 years ago did you uh
expect yourself to be on such a
personal growth path by that i mean
obviously you got you're going trying to
level up in the poker context but do you
feel did you know that you were going to
embark on such a personal growth path
when you got into poker
no
no i didn't know i didn't know that out
of this it was like
it's me amazing amazing poker gave me a
lot actually i have here a tattoo i did
in 2013. i ideally that i had because
poker gave me a lot it's crazy
it's insane
but i didn't know this you know i just
went i just go went into the this path
because
i like play i like to play i like games
i like competition and
then
of course
um yeah i think it shows like someone
who's played as long as you have 12
years while still progressing obviously
you've stagnated at certain periods but
you've been progressing over the course
of that time you can't do that without
loving the game you can't do that
without really really
enjoying what you do and yeah i just
love how the conversation's all been
about you leveling up and almost like a
bit of a spiritual pursuit whilst
playing high-stakes poker and it's funny
because most people think those things
were very
opposite ends of the spectrum meditation
and doing silent retreats and
high-stakes poker seem pretty far away
you've got a monk on one side you've got
a high-stakes gambler on one side but
they're kind of the same pursuit and
when you look at life and growing it's
all about evolving and becoming a better
version of yourself and yeah that you've
kept seeing throughout the conversation
you can't separate the two if you want
to succeed other tables you've got to
find the way to get to know yourself and
become a better version yourself yeah i
think i really like when players are
using the pocket journey to not only
achieve their the freedom and the
finances they want but to become that
ultimate version of themselves to like
step into uh who do i want to be and ask
him really big questions and sometimes
we can go very deep on these
conversations and ask the why we're here
and what we're doing but it is really
fundamental as a human to uh to know
what path you're on and yes you might be
one track mind at a time trying to just
achieve a certain poker goal but at the
same time you're a human on a pursuit
and you're trying to be happy and you're
trying to have good relationships and
you're trying to figure out what this
whole thing in life's about and where
where you're going with it and on that
poker journey you're gonna have to
confront a lot of insecurities or things
that come up and i think you said as
well that poker makes life go faster i i
would agree with that as well i feel
like you learn you have to learn so many
lessons quicker let's say with emotions
for example like i didn't have to deal
with many emotions throughout my life
until i started playing poker and then
as soon as i played poker i was like wow
i've got so many emotions so many
insecurities i did not know that i cared
about money so much i did not care that
i thought it was such a little baby when
i lost so there's so many things that
got thrown into the surface when i
started playing poker it was like either
learn how to deal with that or go and do
something else because poker is very
unforgiving see i think it's really good
when you find a pursuit that you love
you enjoy it you're gaining the life
experience that you want you're working
towards big goals but at the same time
it's it's causing you to grow and you're
improving so i think for you right now
it's very clear the reason you still
play poker is because you love the game
but also because it's still allowing you
to grow so uh in line with that what are
some of the areas you feel like you have
the most growth left to go so obviously
you've been playing poker 12 years you
better confront a lot of things in those
12 years what are some of the the growth
areas that you feel like polka is still
helping with you with this stage of your
life
i have to be better
so i i need to learn a lot yet pogba can
help me a lot with that would be better
with the structure and that
in life i think i'm with still working
with emotions and still being so
emotional so still working with emotion
and yeah this is what what what
this one very good
i would wanna
i still
i am still fighting a lot with
recognition from outside
so
focus helped me a lot with that because
[Music]
it's like that helped me a lot because
now
my focus is if i want to play high
stakes is because
they the game or because whatever but
not because i want to
look for love from outside or
recognition from outside because
it's crazy such an ellucian illusion i
mean
for what
if you die tomorrow nobody's gonna
remind you
doesn't matter i mean for what because
you are a winner of poker me because you
are high stake winner for that is that's
important that help the war
that help people that you achieve a high
stake poker player and you are the best
that
is
for nothing but but
if i
play high-stakes poker because i'm going
to learn a lot and then i will i can
help a lot of people and that people
you know i use for i'm useful in this
way
that's
beautiful
that's beautiful so
um
[Music]
keep learning
breaking that you know breaking the
recognition from our side uh and working
more on
uh i'm here because
i i can help
myself and
if i can help myself i can help people
actually um i'm a little bit exposed in
the spanish community poker spanish
community
but sometimes i have the conflict about
time okay uh realizing time
you know the time is
limited live limited
so i have
yet a lot of work with myself
no so
i think
i need to work a lot of myself and on
the way
for sure
people around is gonna is going to
benefit
any benefits benefits
from me no
but for that you know maybe in this life
i know i could have many life or not
doesn't matter but in this life i think
oh in this
um
next years
i'm gonna be focused on focusing on
myself on keep loving and keep growing
the love of myself
be you know be complete
be full my whole life
i've tried to feel from outside you know
you know when you feel you have empty
lips inside okay i'm gonna buy this
uh maybe he he say i love he said me he
said to me that love means that okay but
that's really is
it's for a moment but
the aims is from inside so if you you
complete yourself you work on your to be
full inside uh then you can focus on
outside you know what and even you don't
have to focus because it's
natural
yes it's like that so
actually this i was thinking about that
the last days what i have to do you know
be exposed in the social media or that
so i'm going to be focusing on myself
but
on the one on the way of course i'm
going to be exposed because
it's beautiful i mean for me it's
amazing it's like a
beautiful you know feel my soul you know
uh so
that's the point i don't know if i say i
answer your question
yeah i wonder how many players get into
polka seeking recognition i bet it's
very very high because focus is one of
those things where
we almost get into it because yes we
like the game it's competitive but we've
also got a bit of a chip on our
shoulders that we want to prove
something we want to be good at
something we want to first of all show
our friends that we're good at this card
game we want to prove to our parents
that we're making the right choice and
playing poker then we want to beat all
our peers and get a gold badge we're
playing high stakes well done you you're
awesome and we're constantly seeking
like validation externally to make us
feel good about this choice of playing
poca and then at some point like you've
talked about you get a point where you
realize wait a second i'm always trying
to fill myself up from out externally by
that i mean you're looking for external
validation external metrics to make
yourself feel good internal and once you
realize that you're like it can never it
can never really get you very far it's
always very fleeting every time you have
success or a win or anything that's
external you want more of it and as soon
as you get the hype from it it fades
very quickly so you left this horrible
predicament where you're like i've done
all the external stuff and i still don't
feel great internally what do i do now
and then you've got to start seeking
your own validation and how to uh
basically make yourself feel fulfilled
and without the external stuff and that
becomes this very big challenge because
you're still pursuing things externally
at the same time you're working on
yourself internally and i really like
what you said about working on yourself
before you work on help others i think
this is a
kind of a high level concept where
basically
if in order to help other people in
order to be a good person in your
immediate environment in particular
you've got to be you've got to work on
yourself you've got to uh almost like
put everything else aside not there not
like working yourself in terms of just
go in the gym or understand yourself and
become a very secure
self
conscious person and someone who's
really in the intuitive with themselves
you're very present and then from there
you can help a lot of people you don't
even need to try to help people because
your natural way of being is inspiring
to the people because you've done work
on yourself and you're not like
everybody else who's trying to uh
validate yourself through your actions
or through your metrics or your external
stuff you're literally just given
because you want to give and you're
which is a heart it takes a lot to get
to i'm a coach so i go back and forth
where i spend a lot of time working on
myself and i spend a lot of time
coaching with people and i'm always
going back between the two because i
know the most value i can ever provide
other people is to work on myself always
like almost always if i go and work i
may work on me when i come back out and
interact with other people i have more
to give i have more to share more to uh
to offer them so yeah i think it's one
of those high-level concepts where we've
got to get to a point where we work on
ourselves enough that we're able to
contribute to other people and at some
points that recognition that you're
seeking externally you've got to give
yourself the recognition the recognition
comes from you you stamp yourself you
give yourself that oin can a
self-approval you gain your self-worth
from who you are every day you look in
the mirror every day and you're proud of
yourself because how you show up and who
you are and that becomes this different
game once you've got that even if it's
not as 100 there like all the time you
still see things externally occasionally
you've got enough of a center as we said
so you always realize ah i feel my own
cup up i'm fulfilled from within and
externally i'll play the game of life
i'll try to achieve stuff but i know
those external things they're just games
life's a game probably it's a game i
don't need to take so seriously it's not
going to make me a better person so yeah
i just wanted to go deep on that once i
know we talked a lot at the start of the
conversation about basically like you
wanted people to love you and being good
at something gives you that and i think
a lot of players watching this so
listening to this will be on a pursuit
to gain recognition for poker and my
advice would be in the short term that's
fine but at some point you need to
realize that pocket isn't going to
validate you your success in
achievements isn't going to get you very
much it's going to be very very hard
and at some point you're going to
transition that into getting recognition
internally and understand who you want
to be and become proud of yourself so
that could be a 10-year episode it could
be 12 episodes could be a 15 ongoing
full lifetime receipt but some points uh
seeking your own uh recognition is super
important so yeah thanks for sharing all
that that was very very insightful all
right ready if you've got any further
questions any dig deep in a dig
yeah
we're gonna be uh wrapping it up soon i
have one final question um
this was actually one of the motivations
that jose wanted to be on he said we
usually ask like is there anything you
would like to share in this podcast and
he said share my understanding of life
well obviously this could be a podcast
part two probably
but i'm still gonna try to draw this
question here at the end jose
you want to share your understanding of
life i think you've done throughout the
podcast right uh anything
any final things you would like to share
with our listeners before we wrapping it
up
uh
i have to say like um
say goodbye with the last phrase or last
words and said
try to be a good person with your with
yourself
i think that that's the point the most
important point in life for me i will be
good
with you and with the
the people around
yeah often we treat others nicer than
ourselves right like
for example especially when it comes
down to
uh your inner critic the way you talk to
yourself oh you're so [ __ ] stupid why
do you do that yeah you would not say
that to someone that you like right so
first start is that kind of what you
mean start treating yourself in a nicer
way
yeah
you have to be you have to love yourself
to
uh treat you with love and work on that
because i think that's the point i mean
the only thing that matters
in life
is you
[Music]
working yourself i mean
there if you die tomorrow doesn't matter
then you are nothing and you are all you
know it's like
do that tomorrow okay yeah your family
is going to agree you're going to cry
so
pay attention yourself do things
that really you want to do and don't
think too much in the outside because
part of the part of the time of
um a lot of time
in our life
and we do things because the rest want
us to do because if we do this we are
good whatever you know so you are living
the
life from the other the other the other
you know so i'm living
um i'm working a lot on this because
like i told you i still i i told you
guys um
for me it was so important what people
think about me so if i do something that
is out of the box sometimes
sometimes yes sometimes i feel like i'm
shy or
sometimes for example uh
um last time i catch i catch me doing
this because uh i wanted to do yoga so
in front of my house in the door is a
park and no one is doing yoga there and
if i go to new york there may be
people's gonna look for me
uh what he's doing oh
he's doing that good he's doing that but
ah
what's he doing well
i think i went
um when i was doing you i said amazing
really you want to do you are doing yoga
here because
it's good for yourself
if someone's saying something whatever
it doesn't matter because if you die
tomorrow you think he's gonna come to
the park to say oh that guy
didn't didn't come back oh and his dude
was doing yoga but so bad
you know doesn't matter
and maybe even you know
it's like crazy you know that to do this
because
or to don't do things
because other because others right if
you go from love
you can do it everything
don't drop your mic i think it's like on
your laptop so you would drop your
laptop probably not a great idea uh save
that for very tilty session uh but also
this is not to be mistaken when it's a
focus on yourself
it's not it's not to be mistaken by
being selfish right
i think i think there could be a person
or two that's like okay so i should
focus more myself
and they interpret this in a very
selfish way but like you said you you
said many times help others uh be good
with yourself so you can contribute it's
it's the complete opposite uh yeah
but you have to find the balance of
course
but the complete opposite but
you
like poker okay you are in a marginal
decision
okay so try to think about yourself
first and then to the other right you
know you have to always use the rng so
use it in your favor than the others but
always from love i mean
not hurting anyone or something like
that you know um
so that's the
i think so important you said that
because sometimes
um sometimes we talk about something
and when you teach poker it's happening
a lot actually when i say something
about a han i always ask to the
the
i say the the
student
to write the conclusion
um about what he understand from me
because sometimes it's like a he didn't
understand
what i didn't say this you know so
thanks to to to say that because so
important the big point
all right well i would like to thank you
for contributing your wisdom
through this podcast through the poker
world i'm sure many people are going to
be listening to this and learn a lot and
hope that everyone gets excited on the
journey that they're on and they indeed
start to share your perspective of
seeing it as a big opportunity to grow
not only poker but in the game of life
um
the last thing i want to say is a
goal for me okay
next time i see you see now in the next
months years i'm going to be focusing
on my english level okay so next time i
see you
you have talked a lot
it's time for me i think it's time for
me so to take it to another level yeah
but i mean every time you you you travel
you go to ecuador mexico and no english
there man yeah i have to go to another
place now australia
yeah yeah
thanks again to jose for sharing his
knowledge
he's been on quite the journey
and i really liked the
the way he grabbed poker by the horns
and used it as an opportunity to grow
this is actually something that i often
say to players as well i also often
really think it's a waste when people
just try to go through the motions just
try to grind out some money and they
kind of look for
for other things outside of poker
whereas if you really try to focus on
becoming a better poker player there's
so much opportunities to grow and i
think the conversation with jose really
showed that adam what were some of your
main takeaways
yeah it was a far-reaching conversation
and the whole
everything was around his growth path on
and off the tables and yeah definitely
we can see that he was developing skills
along the way one of the things he deals
with a lot that was still dealing with
now is his emotions and he calls himself
something like a heightened emotional
person and he's had to deal with big
fluctuations in his game so when he's
off off his center he would call it he's
playing c game he plays some some really
bad poker and spews off and makes big
mistakes on the flip side when he's in
his center he's playing his best he's a
completely different player so he's had
to learn how to manage that how to
understand when he's in a heightened
emotional state sometimes it's better
just not showing up even i think it was
a few months ago a few weeks ago where
he lost a lot of buy-ins at the high
stakes because something in his personal
life threw him off so somebody calls in
i'm sure players watching who are highly
emotional people you're going to have to
find ways throughout your career to best
manage that and best be able to deal
with heightened emotions and he's got
better and better and better at it he
can now consciously see himself and how
emotions affect him but he still i can
progress this i think it's a growth
avenue that he's still exploring i liked
it we talked about commitment and he
talked about uh compromise but basically
we talked about how it took 12 years to
get to the top and he said he could have
probably got there quicker if he was
more committed and right now he's at a
point where he's committed to the poker
pursuit he knows his wise which are love
of the game and freedom he's committed
to his relationships which are helping
him grow so this one it's like getting
clear on why you're doing what you're
doing and this changes as you're
progressing through your life and poker
a lot of players will be to make money
to move sticks but you got a point where
that doesn't do it for you it got a
point where for him where it wasn't um
kind of inspiring him so he had to
really develop like or reconnect with
what he's playing poker for and now he's
got that now he feels very fortunate
very lucky to wake up in the morning and
play poker he's almost like
pinching himself because i'm so
fortunate to do this because he's he's
got clarity and he's able to commit
himself from there and the final thing
was a perspective very very good at
seeing a positive perspective and using
all life obstacles as a way to get
better and to uh progress and he talked
about the chaos a lot and he was talking
about kind of the darkness and the light
that part i remember and he saw what
chaos is the
start of creation and i like that so
he's very i think how deep he was going
with this but what i was getting from
that was he's talking about when things
are tough so let's say chaos is a
downswing we can use that downswing as a
spark to get better to improve so it's
creating moments to actually learn from
and if you can go through life with this
kind of objective and not non-attachment
so you're going for your life scenarios
and you're going over a second this is
quite extreme variance of extreme but
downswing and you're looking for
opportunities to grow from that oh my
god doors are going to open you've got
so many opportunities so i think
throughout that conversation he was
talking about sometimes he failed at
that often but also how he tries to uh
instill that as a kind of blueprint but
thinking change your perspective try to
think everything's a
kind of work in progress and how i can
grow from it so yeah so many other
examples i could have covered but yeah
very
deep conversation and i enjoyed it very
much how about yourself for any i need
the technical side of the game where
it's really interesting for you
yeah but also the empathetic side and
this is also actually something that i
think keeps on coming back with multiple
players that they are very empathetic
towards themselves i think it was in the
podcast with figar that he also talked
to yeah we're human that came back again
so i think that's wisdom
the thing that you said also with
committed if quitting is not an option
you become more results for because i
think a lot of people quit too early
and if quitting is an option when things
get hard you choose that option you're
like okay i quit but if quitting is not
an option like okay quitting is not an
option so what do i do in order to
progress and then you come up with ideas
that if quitting was an option you would
not have come up with because you would
have already quit i think you know this
is not only true in poker this is true
in everything people don't stick at
something long enough or they're not
committed enough in order to surpass by
the chaos that will come in the way of
trying to reach mastery in any craft uh
coming also to the point of a bit more
technical actually technical and again
he framed it in terms of when players
are off their center okay when this
player's off their center he usually
tilts maybe in a certain way that i can
take advantage of so again the human
aspect i think uh that was really
something
different for me like i've looked at
this in terms of recreations but not
really in terms of professionals i would
just see a player and expect him to play
a certain way always
uh but he's very right i mean people are
human same for me i would have also
arranged in my game he indeed also
mentioned in terms of the range of the
game that his range that he has between
his a game and c game did uh start to
tighten i think we talked about this
with the europe podcast as well uh and
that mainly came true to studying more
theory and he really needed to study
more theory in order to really reach the
higher stakes right he went exploitative
got them very far then he added gto and
then he actually went back to
exploitative because if you understand
the theory better you also understand
when something doesn't apply and so you
become actually a better exploitive
player through the use of theory which
is the same path that i walked and i can
definitely uh relate to what he has been
through
um
yeah i think i
remember also the game selection point
right that's a very important point as
well and this is indeed something that
players often forget
uh if you want to remember
one thing or you want to know one secret
to making a lot of money in poker pay
attention that is
you have to play against players that
are worse than you
for as much money as you can afford to
lose
okay and try to play as much volume as
possible under those circumstances
and yeah the game selection part is
often a point that's that's forgot
that's often forgotten uh
which like i said maybe it's a bit of a
sh people feel maybe a little bit
ashamed oh i have to make money from the
recreationals but due to also the
side-sticking rake that is
usually true okay that's kind of how it
is uh obviously certain pros will be
better than other pros like
jose said he would sometimes hunt
players that are off their center
remember yuri saying everyone is a fish
only
so
you can also hunt the regulars but you
know obviously if you play against the
will uh you will make more money than if
you don't play against the will
all right
