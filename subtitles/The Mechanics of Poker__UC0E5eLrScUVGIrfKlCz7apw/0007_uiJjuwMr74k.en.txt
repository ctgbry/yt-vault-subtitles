[00:00]
should i share share a little secret
with you guys
how to make money in poker why not
let's share a little secret all right
all right all right
and we are live guys welcome to the
stream

[00:15]
stream
the first official one the other ones
were
unofficial as we were experiencing some
technical difficulties
so i guess the official launch of the
stream was delayed for a week in the
meanwhile we did
a couple of small streams just to fix a
couple of bugs

[00:30]
couple of bugs
and actually i started a little bit
early because
i wanted to share something with you
guys before we would dive in
because as you can see this is not a not
not not a pokestar stable but
a hand that i've played and i kind of

[00:45]
a hand that i've played and i kind of
wanted to give you guys a little
a little insight in what i do before
actually i start play a session
in general uh i think how you prepare
for your session or how you go into your
session
is gonna be a very it's going to have a
big effect of how you're going to
perform during your session

[01:01]
perform during your session
so i think having a certain pre-session
routine is very
important and i will show you guys
something that i usually do
in general i will set certain intentions
um intentions and focus points and

[01:16]
um intentions and focus points and
intention is sort of a way you want to
show up to the tables you could say
my intention for example i usually
have is love for tough spots and
tough opponents in general when i play
against tough opponents i want to

[01:31]
against tough opponents i want to
react by being enthusiastic because
basically if you play against tough
opponents they will play in tough spots
and the default response can be like
headaches and like
and i actually prefer to have a response
that is

[01:46]
that is
more appreciative i guess for the
opportunity so not seeing it less as an
less as a threat but more as an
opportunity as in
like okay this is very cool you're
putting me very
tough situation thank you for trying to

[02:01]
tough situation thank you for trying to
raise my standards okay because if i'm
not being put in tough spots
i will not grow as a poker player so
this is kind of a change in association
and general attentions of the way i
would like to show up
to a table and without further ado

[02:15]
to a table and without further ado
i was already at the tables let's put on
some music
that's a nice sound and we will start
playing some poker hands i'm gonna start
up with a three bet
straight from

[02:31]
the back
in the meanwhile we have started to get
some viewers and some
chats let me see what this guy's

[02:45]
chats let me see what this guy's
planning
because very good board for me
what's the correct sizing

[03:00]
i think a good port to size big on i
don't think
almost any threes after i three but this
big big blind versus button so it's
quite a dry board
and i think jax would be like the not
hand i think to bet big
but tens is fine as well

[03:18]
but tens is fine as well
hi should i take poker series as a
micro-wreck even though i have a good
normally job
yes you should try to take poker as
serious as possible usually
people tend to wait before they're at a

[03:31]
people tend to wait before they're at a
certain level
and then they think like oh no but if
i'm at that level i will start taking it
more seriously no that's not true
whenever you're at that level you would
just do what you're
using what you were used to doing as
this quote that says
how you do something is how you do
everything so you always have to

[03:46]
everything so you always have to
question yourself
how do i want to show up not only at the
poker tables but you have to be
consistent like that
in other situations okay so for example
what i said
interested curious playful that's how i
want to show up in other kinds of
scenarios

[04:00]
scenarios
one thing this quote is always top of
mind
when i'm in the gym and
i don't know i did nine reps for example
and i wanted
and my goal was to do 12 but then that
voice in your head's like ah you know
nine is not that bad but if you skip on

[04:17]
nine is not that bad but if you skip on
those it's not necessarily that that you
would skip on that wrong rap it's like
ah you know that one rep
but if you start to get in that mindset
of ah it's only one rep
you will start to apply this ah but it's
only up but it's only
in any part of your life so remember

[04:31]
in any part of your life so remember
guys how you do one thing is how you do
everything
so yes i would just try to take it as
serious as possible
make a little note here
suited hand four way and this guy as you

[04:47]
suited hand four way and this guy as you
can just see by the note
it's quite spazzy and now he dunks out
[Music]
don't know him this is a tough spot
this is a very tough spot because i can

[05:00]
this is a very tough spot because i can
have to call but if he goes over the top
now it's an easy spot now it's an easy
spot to watch it

[05:15]
i think i should just jam because
basically if he had a because if i bet
anything
if i bet anything smaller he can call
then he can just over call

[05:32]
just hope he doesn't have a set oh you
had a better hand
that was terrible
terribly unlucky i mean not not
necessarily terrible
and he's slow playing king queen there

[05:45]
and he's slow playing king queen there
but he's also slow playing aces because
for him it's probably the same hand
and basically if i would have bet any
smaller sizing
if i would have bet any smaller sizing
it

[06:01]
it would have just invited two ranges to
continue basically if both rangers were
willing to put
15 big blinds in the pot if i bet small
they're most likely to peel
and the board is still it's gonna change
quite a lot and
yes this guy we're gonna flop a set man

[06:16]
yes this guy we're gonna flop a set man
i have to say whenever i started
started streaming i'm going to take a
look afterwards towards my set
flop set percentage because it's been
out of the roof
really insane and the guy bets 120 pot
twitch good run twitch good run

[06:31]
twitch good run twitch good run
yes i heard about this never experienced
it
but this is very nice he checks i check
as well and then he just rips it in with
queen 10 suited
so he's thinking hard you think he's

[06:45]
so he's thinking hard you think he's
slow rolling me
that would be funny no it's it's trying
to seem like he has a decision
he checks like i said i'm going to check
he has queen 10 suited like i said
earlier now i'm just going to check
behind and let him love the river

[07:06]
if he checks again he probably has
nothing actually i
guess nothing
i did actually see him spaz earlier

[07:19]
he's passed earlier versus a very small
bet
so i think i'll go for that again i
think if he has queens or jacks or
something he might still actually race
versus the best this bet

[07:30]
versus the best this bet
she didn't that's very unfortunate
normally i would just go in there but
we played ahead before the twitch stream
started where
he basically gave me a stack when i bet
it very small he started to bluff i
think a middle pair or something

[07:45]
think a middle pair or something
second table is jack he min race from
early good three bets
or could calm this case
there's not really a reason for me to
make a decision so in this case

[08:00]
make a decision so in this case
i as they say ruled low
so that's kind of how i try to mix
things up there because like if he's
first at first i check if there's a
tendency or
you know if there's something here at
the tables that makes me think one

[08:15]
the tables that makes me think one
player is clearly better than the other
if not
then i will just randomize it i think
versus turn barrel we should still
continue
with ace jack
i like a stern bed i think he puts quite
a lot of my lower pairs in a difficult
spot
which is a very big part of my range

[08:35]
and those ants are like let's say i have
fives without a heart this is a hand
that's very hard to continue now he goes
for the open
on the river with quite a poor bluff
catcher let's say we
had eights uh

[08:46]
had eights uh
eights with a heart for example i would
definitely continue on the turn with
same with probably fives with the hearts
those would now be good calling hands
ace jackets obviously terrible
due to its blockers she she
asks what's the highest that i've played

[09:03]
under 200 but not a lot of hands i would
say
5100 at a high frequency
you know i get check raised here ugh

[09:17]
it's kind of quite a [ __ ] up spot i
don't think he's bluffing all that often
i think i'm actually going to make a
knit default here
don't really see this being a bluff all

[09:32]
don't really see this being a bluff all
that often
should i share share a little secret
with you guys
how to make money in poker why not
let's share a little secret don't play
lion's love
why do people keep playing that guy

[09:46]
why do people keep playing that guy
seriously
tip of the day if you ask me so for any
of the guys listening
tip of the day don't play versus line of
love uh
this one this one was the hand we played
against takla [ __ ] earlier it's a

[10:01]
against takla [ __ ] earlier it's a
funky hand guys funky hand don't try
this at home
so i called the overcall with deuces
flop a set
you know because we're twitching and
when you're twitching you flop sets more
often
this was actually two recreational

[10:16]
this was actually two recreational
players i decided to play it slow
let that [ __ ] do something and then
actually the term was an
ace and i bet out
because it's the funky thing to do i
remember what the intention was

[10:30]
remember what the intention was
i have to play playful creative that's
kind of my
my thing so um
erased as sort of you know i had kind of
a feeling that this would happen
so i called and river is a four

[10:47]
so i called and river is a four
um and now you would say okay you're
going to check call him
no but i decided to lead again and then
mr taklafoch turned in the stack
and actually i'll let you guys guess the
hand okay

[11:00]
hand okay
oh someone has their right to that
at work
but let's go back to this hand this
hand's way more fun

[11:18]
a set means big bet that rhymes
that's what we're going for river quite
interesting
let me see if i bet small is he ever

[11:31]
let me see if i bet small is he ever
raising
kind of a question are we actually still
betting a jack no
probably not are we betting ace jack i
think
we're a betting ace jack
no i'm just gonna

[11:49]
i was thinking of blocking i think
there's definitely some hands in my
reigns that want to block
mainly king jack for example is a great
hand to start blocking here we flop
a very good hand versus a very good

[12:00]
a very good hand versus a very good
player
mr big blind bats bbb i remember
actually when i was playing i sticks he
kind of came
up and started crushing everyone like 15
bb 100 or something
and again guys do you want the tip a
secret tip to make money in poker

[12:16]
secret tip to make money in poker
if someone wins 40 maybe 100 and is
crushing everyone
you shouldn't be playing against this
guy so he was definitely one of the guys
who i wasn't playing against in the
meanwhile we got a call he was thinking
quite long about it with pocket aces
and big my bets is over betting us and

[12:31]
and big my bets is over betting us and
we have
a very pure continue here with ace king
river that seems quite good however
versus
mr bbb i don't think

[12:45]
is going to give up on this river quite
often
even though it's a river that people do
i think
give up on some of the time it is a
card that definitely also improves my
range no reason to bat ace king though

[13:03]
he actually gave up he choked him
mr bbb he choked him
he choked him what did he choke with he
had a bad bluff

[13:15]
what ah that that is a choke that is a
joke right there guys
you can see as you can see we're playing
against humans
obviously a very good player and i think
in my opinion he should always be
bluffing this hand

[13:31]
bluffing this hand
so it's a pure choke
it's kind of a dilemma right you're
blocking ace king but in the same time
you're also blocking aces you're
blocking a flash shooter you're blocking
five six series you're blocking six
seven suited

[13:45]
so yes i think definitely a bluff
well we have h3 i will get back to the
chat
soon should i check car should i check
race
i'm gonna check called his hands

[14:03]
and we're flushing he
checks
which i think is going to do quite a lot

[14:20]
let's check with the river
maybe should have went for the block bed
instead but i don't think he's raising
that thing here on the river
yeah this was kind of the problem but

[14:31]
yeah this was kind of the problem but
even if i would have been very big it's
very hard for me to be bluffing because
basically i love hands where is it
a lot of hands that he's gonna have for
hands like this
i think in hindsight

[14:45]
i think in hindsight
blocking better and checking i don't
think we should be betting big
i mean if i block he's always calling
i check he's not always betting
apparently he snapped behind
which makes a lot of sense

[15:06]
yeah maybe maybe black belting would
have been better i don't know
maybe over opening seven eight suited
we're gonna call it three bet
we also have asus on the other table no

[15:16]
we also have asus on the other table no
longer
okay and we flop
actually it looks prettier than it is in
hindsight but
you know see all these things going on
that's half pots
and i'm gonna proceed by calling

[15:33]
and i'm gonna proceed by calling
but it's a hand that we should not get
too enthusiastic about just yet
checks here this is a very good turn for
us let me see
i think this is a fine hand

[15:48]
i think this is a fine hand
to that yes
and now we have check i think a board
bear is very bad
wow we could have been in so much

[16:01]
wow we could have been in so much
trouble he had a flush and a straight
actually i think he should probably bet
his hand on the turn
yeah true is it's good rob m says you
know basically if you're a twitcher any
mistake you make he says listen
i'm [ __ ] multitasking what do you

[16:15]
i'm [ __ ] multitasking what do you
want me to do that's good man
any mistake i make and just blame it on
twitch
no guys actually wait this is the this
is
let me also try to educate you guys uh

[16:30]
let me also try to educate you guys uh
in the correct way if you make a mistake
on your mistake please
basically i think the world is way
easier to you if you just
go around with the philosophy of
everything is my fault and everything
happens for a reason
so if someone i walk down the street and

[16:45]
so if someone i walk down the street and
someone punches me in the face
i'm gonna be like okay i don't know how
yet but this is somehow probably my own
fault
and uh this probably happens for a
reason a bigger reason that i currently
don't understand
quite universal [ __ ] going on right now

[17:00]
quite universal [ __ ] going on right now
but yeah basically just
the world becomes way kinder if you just
own all your mistakes and be like the
opposite of a victim
hey do you do coaching

[17:15]
hey do you do coaching
i coach a bunch of students yes
early no new
no new uh applications available though
but if you are interested in learning
more about

[17:31]
more about
our philosophy and the way we approach
poker
exclamation point mechanics of poker is
our program
which is going to be released actually
now i can finally
say it in a correct way the mechanics of

[17:47]
say it in a correct way the mechanics of
poker is our program which will be
released in the poker ambition club
which will be available to join early
next year
so if you're interested in learning why
i do
all the [ __ ] that i do

[18:01]
all the [ __ ] that i do
then yeah you can learn it there
basically
let me wire with three betting ace king

[18:26]
checking

[18:33]
it's back and now we can start applying
some pressure

[18:54]
so

[19:03]
decent river as it's more likely that i
am actually bluffing a 7 then that he
is calling with a 7.

[19:15]
and it makes it less likely as i said

[19:36]
but he is not believing and hero called
me
with the 89 which

[19:48]
does that make sense

[20:02]
[Music]

[20:17]
it's whatever i've like blockers kind of
go two ways here let's say he has king
jack
he's blocking some value but he's also
blocking bluff so i
don't think your hand really matters
much here if you're been a beat

[20:30]
much here if you're been a beat
just estimate if you think it's likely
that i'm bluffing a lot
if so then by all means call if no then
by all means fault
but he clearly thought i was
mr sabino asks how bad is the king of
spades well i would prefer not to have

[20:46]
spades well i would prefer not to have
the king of spade but
how bad is it how bad is it i actually
took a look it's it's only i think
it i think it was only king eight of
spades that i'm not blocking i hand that

[21:01]
spades that i'm not blocking i hand that
would call turn fold river
i'm not necessarily that concerned
someone asked about the
it's about to have the king of spades
let me actually check
because i didn't think so yeah we're
basically
thinking we suited queen queen of space

[21:16]
thinking we suited queen queen of space
he could definitely bet the flop
think that's more likely the offshoot
version could definitely check but i
think with the back the flusher i think
it's fine to bet
like i said i'm only blocking like
king aid of spades

[21:30]
king aid of spades
so i think it's fine i think it's a
board that i'm gonna do quite a lot of
checking on with hands like king queen
ace queen
aces jax queens
so yeah i like my play there and

[21:45]
so yeah i like my play there and
actually i think that is about
it guys for today you guys have any
suggestions
please do let us know and that's about
it guys thank you very much
for tuning in to the stream i hope you
enjoyed and i hope you learned something
along the way

[22:00]
along the way
