[00:00]
yeah apparently we lead spades but then
okay
we know
but this is clearly a bluff
jamming king queen is clearly a bluff
right here space okay so actually we
should have maybe considered bluffing

[00:15]
should have maybe considered bluffing
the river with all in sizing
okay yeah yeah yeah yeah all right
chicken sound for the wacko
[Music]

[00:33]
welcome back to another play and explain
in which i'm going to be playing
and explaining that's why it's called a
play and explain
i'm going to fire up two tables of 500 l

[00:45]
i'm going to fire up two tables of 500 l
zoo
i like the the zoom format to make
videos as you don't have to
bother of tables opening closing
etc
and you can get quite some hands in and
quite some spots in which is uh which is

[01:00]
quite some spots in which is uh which is
good for the video maybe if one day
i have two similar tables three
four-handed maybe that would also be a
good video so i'll uh
if that moment comes up i'll make sure
to record it
for now i think it's fine

[01:17]
is jack with the aza clubs i might
consider check raising blocking a bit
more value let's say we had
aces spades jack of hearts and we don't
block the a7 suited
i think now uh it's a fine hand to check

[01:31]
i think now uh it's a fine hand to check
race
we also have the jack of spades
he will have less jackex that will have
backup equity so for example he calls
king jack of hearts whereas if i have
the jack of hearts he calls kane jack of

[01:46]
the jack of hearts he calls kane jack of
spades having more equity versus my hand
so i think exactly with those suits
everything
exactly in a way that i would like it to
be
to go for a check raise
go for three bet here versus

[02:01]
go for three bet here versus
recreational player
start off with a small bet
i'm gonna go for a barrel

[02:17]
just hoping to fold out the end like ace
jack a stand
would have like pocket force in the top
spot if he has it
and obviously you know we have equity
off bot there equity that basically

[02:30]
off bot there equity that basically
almost never has to work
pocket five's gonna mix a little bit
between i can think basically of
everything but mainly fold and go

[02:47]
for eight should be a decent board for
me actually
i'm going to mix this in an erase revolt
quite high so i'll throw in a raise

[03:01]
and it's basically a denial race plus i
can get called some of the time
but let's say he see that's a hand like
10 jack off if he does it too often i
think we should punish him by raising
and it's not really a board you should

[03:15]
and it's not really a board you should
do a lot of 130 betting on basically i
don't think i have a fault
maybe i fold
what's the hand that i call the button
that i would photo one third on eight
deuce for
i cannot really think of a hand so that
usually means uh not really a great

[03:30]
usually means uh not really a great
strategy i decided not to barrel you
could make an argument with the five of
clubs that it's a fine barrel let's say
i had like five four suited or ace four
suited uh i think i prefer barreling
that you know blocks the river which i
think is a good play and i'm just gonna
fold i achieved achieved my goal if he

[03:48]
fold i achieved achieved my goal if he
checks like i said i sometimes win
he could have ace king
and i'm blocking the blast mainly ace
five that's also the only offsuit hand

[04:01]
five that's also the only offsuit hand
that he has
here with ace four
you can do a couple of things
i'm gonna go for a check race
you should not have

[04:15]
you should not have
pocket threes always even though there
is a recreational here so i guess he's
gonna open it more often
but that does kind of suck
the king seven i think i'm gonna check
again
actually i think i'm just gonna rip it
in

[04:30]
in
i think it's just time to ship it in and
go to bed
and hope he doesn't have a set basically
here the king seven i think i'm gonna go

[04:45]
here the king seven i think i'm gonna go
for a value but
the only hand that we don't want to see

[05:00]
the only hand that we don't want to see
here is sevens
but i think if he has eight nine stance
even jacks he's in a pretty tough spot
like i said he timed for quite a long
time before calling with tens tens is in
a quite a tough spot i mean we have an
open end there

[05:15]
open end there
basically he ran into
sort of best case scenario
so with tens there
worst case scenario i just have an over
pair and he's dead
uh to be fair he did have backup equity
to go with his hand
so that made it a little bit more of a

[05:31]
so that made it a little bit more of a
call and i guess he would sometimes
think i played jax this way tense his
way as
well but basically he ran into
one of the better scenarios
which is basically still flipping

[05:45]
which is basically still flipping
i have an open end there
i think seven here good sometimes do
something
the recreational here in the small blind
here i'm definitely check raising

[06:05]
and definitely barely

[06:28]
increasing your radases

[06:32]
this flyback has sometimes open
well that one
is a very good board for me
i'm just gonna make a small c

[06:46]
i'm just gonna make a small c
bet because
7 is quite good reduces the amount of
combos of 7.

[07:06]
definitely going to keep on betting
by the king i might consider checking

[07:22]
i think a king is
his most likely hand
i don't think you ever rivers and these

[07:49]
it's very hard for me to to show up with
a bluff here so
let's try to forbid here

[08:01]
and obviously
and we cooled at him big time
this is a good thing of the small bet i
don't think we lose much value
from

[08:17]
from hands that we cooler but let's say
he has a flush or a boat he's still
going to race versus the 10
like
i was considering 20 or 30 but then i
think a flush might just call at first
10 percent i think it's very hard to

[08:30]
10 percent i think it's very hard to
just call with a flush in a spot where
i'm going to have
ace king very often ace queen
and obviously i mean he got very unlucky

[08:50]
let's say for example we had pocket
kings there it's a different story
because then i think he
is rivering

[09:01]
he's rivering way more hands

[09:17]
so if we have [ __ ] kings you can
sometimes river the ace x
clubs so then suddenly we could consider
getting bigger because asexual clubs is
not going to raise versus my 10

[09:33]
this hand
good spot to go to a before bluff
bad hand though

[09:49]
and the pocket knives we're just going
to go for a step

[10:10]
this close i'm going to actually go for
a block here again

[10:19]
the tank tank tank tank tank tank tank
for a very long time with nine ten and
cult

[10:31]
that means that he recognized
the board as basically an amazing run
out for me that's why i decided to bluff
a hand that's
as bad as a hand to bluff with as my
hand basically

[10:49]
i think i did make a mistake though
i think on the river we will definitely
still have some three quarterbacks and i
think my hands should have just went in
at three quarters

[11:05]
let's say we add
so
it's a very interesting spot
in general when you when you have a
split betting range so there we could

[11:16]
split betting range so there we could
have
maybe half bought three quarters ish
so let's say 66 and a gem
your gem will still be reserved for

[11:30]
your gem will still be reserved for
hands that block a straight
it's not because i think he can have a
straight all that often
even though you could say king queen
close

[11:45]
close
i guess he could have king queen some of
the time okay actually if he can have
king queen some of the time
yeah actually i think i think i maybe
over value the board a little bit let's
say the river was uh
jack knight a king

[12:01]
jack knight a king
then i think uh we can we definitely
have a license to jam but to go come
back to my story you still want to
want to block
the
i'm gonna bet this some of the time the
board i'm gonna mix on
but quite high so i'll go for the bat

[12:16]
but quite high so i'll go for the bat
with pocket fives
we can
spot i'm going to split
i think this one goes in a block

[12:37]
so yeah you go back to my story you
still want to block the straight because
his hero calls are going to be hands
that block a straight okay so even

[12:45]
that block a straight okay so even
though it's it might be a spot let's say
for argument's sake that he cannot have
a straight
we still want to block the straight
because then we block the hero call so
and like queen 9 for example
uh
would be a good hero call basically the
reason why he tanked with two pair

[13:00]
reason why he tanked with two pair
is because he perceived myself to be
the reason why he fought along with two
pair which is an absolute strong hand is

[13:15]
pair which is an absolute strong hand is
because he perceived my jam to be i
guess stronger to pair plus

[13:39]
he perceived my reign should be stronger
to per plus that's why he thanks so
basically as a bluff catcher which is

[13:45]
basically as a bluff catcher which is
not
blocking much of my value range which is
not
completely true let me see rivert
actually his turn call is a bit
optimistic i would say
the 910
basically for the reason that he tanked

[14:02]
basically for the reason that he tanked
the turn
that is the reason
why he tanked on the river that's the
reason why his turn call is quite
optimistic
this end can go either way

[14:15]
this end can go either way
keep it this time i would sometimes call
this i know there's a lot of people who
don't really want to call but
find him to call it
and now when the eight rivers i do think
we should bet

[14:34]
as you can now sometimes i've revered an
eight
let's say the river was a deuce or
something i would probably check
so yeah great example we had 10 8.

[14:46]
so let's say the river is
actually a deuce let's say the river is
a three
in that spot
completing hands for me and one i have
less bluffs and he has less hands to go

[15:01]
less bluffs and he has less hands to go
with and then for example i would check
because we have the jack as well right
the jack is a primary hand that he plays
bad check call
so then i would check that hand again

[15:15]
and then i would
and then he would bluff 108 but now 8 is
a pair so i decided
i think i'm gonna better small sizing
here if he has a low
we're blocking like some of the low the
low flushes the pocket fives pocket

[15:31]
low flushes the pocket fives pocket
sevens five sticks
mainly pocket fives and pocket sevens i
would say
this is spot i'm going to mix between
three quarters

[15:46]
three quarters
and on third but mainly three quarters
on a two-tone i love one-third betting
definitely barreling here it's a
straight and a flush complete
i think i'm not gonna

[16:00]
i think i'm not gonna
that too big
say half pots actually already
in doubt i'll go for 40.
when you were doubt between 30 and 50
bet 40. that's my advice

[16:17]
but yeah as you see for he's gonna have
a lot of hands that have
a tough time defending versus that
sizing
because of how connected the port was so
hard for me to have
shitty hands

[16:30]
shitty hands
we faced a delay
don't have a heart in my hand
too thick i'm still going to feel

[16:48]
if he checks the river i think i'm just
going to check
and lose
because i let's say for example he
delays even at 10 nine with a heart yeah
he's obviously gonna fight it through on
the king so i think then if he checks he

[17:01]
the king so i think then if he checks he
probably has an asic king or at least
something that's unlike default that was
sometimes three but sometimes called
sometimes whatever
sometimes fault

[17:28]
in our board is very good for our range

[17:31]
in our board is very good for our range
but i would see that
could also check back this hand because
it's very [ __ ]
but
in the same time there's not a lot of

[17:45]
in the same time there's not a lot of
reason to have a lot of check packs on
this port but i guess this would
probably be the first candidate queen
eight is better because i could now
barrel i think 10 is better
space in general are okay
but the 9 really sucks or check

[18:01]
but the 9 really sucks or check
i'm gonna move them to patrick bet
here i think i'm going to
check
and let him do something funky on the
river

[18:23]
i think having a queen is quite good
because we blocked the ace queen
it checks i think we're gonna check this

[18:30]
it checks i think we're gonna check this
one

[18:47]
using both from my ranges i would say
and a five second of force
let's do the basis
definitely over betting the turn

[19:03]
and five six suited five four suited
but i don't think that that that's
really hands that people would
always put me on

[19:19]
you can even go a little bit smaller
than this but this river is very good
for me
so i do
i have an ace i have a 10

[19:32]
i have an ace i have a 10
ton of heart
debating a check call
give him my exact hand

[19:51]
let's add pocket five so definitely bet
again

[20:00]
let's say i had for some reason ace
queen i might decide to bet but i think
this hand
functions fine as a check call say i had
queen eight spades you could also have
green eight of hearts
and then we're
quite happy

[20:18]
this hand that will the low frequency
call we're a little bit deeper and the
deeper we get the more uh
i like calling

[20:30]
i don't think we should bet this
this is uh people this is a spot that i
think
sometimes people get wrong where they
say that they want a bet against that
for protection against a flush draw
and as a

[20:46]
and as a
good friend
bill lewinsky aka euros rice once
explained me you cannot protect
against the flush draw you can value
that against you can only protect
against hands
that fall to a bat but let's say if i

[21:01]
that fall to a bat but let's say if i
bet the turn i bet for protection
against jack then off suit from rom
party here
okay
but i bet for value against flush draws
so i would much likely i would much more
likely bet this hand on a rainbow board
than on a two-tone board on a double
two-tone board

[21:17]
two-tone board
i hope that makes sense
because you cannot get a flashlight to
fall so then
basically what happens on the turn if
you bet on the board that has two flush
drills there's more hands that call you
that have quite a lot of equity also i

[21:30]
that have quite a lot of equity also i
would still have to touch
a parrot board
i'm against two ranges that can have
basically anything i would sometimes
stream at sometimes call this

[21:45]
then roll low enough to
do something here we do have a pull up
in our hand but
check
but the ace of clubs
i bet for
some future benefit purposes

[22:01]
some future benefit purposes
here i'm going to
do a bit of everything
all this time
check

[22:27]
i'm going to check the river
i'll be win versus a7 i was gonna say

[22:32]
i'll be win versus a7 i was gonna say
hope we reverse a seven and what do we
do we win versus a7 here i play the port
which is usually not great
i'm gonna go forward let's see but we
have great we do have a good hand in
terms of blocking jackson tents

[22:57]
but i think uh especially if you see
that king for deuce a little bit too

[23:00]
that king for deuce a little bit too
often my bet on the river there is
printing
just
i have air he is air
just air versus air i think we already
are printing it doesn't you can still
hero calls with quite some eight sizes
of this hands um

[23:15]
may need to be betting
four bats
hello

[23:39]
don't i see that sometimes
check i think this hand can literally do
a bit of everything

[23:45]
a bit of everything
this board is also a port where you can
do check you can use big sizings you can
use a couple of small sizings
it's all fine

[24:15]
i cannot really bet that turn he's on a
flash completing turn first of all
obviously when i've made some hands that
yeah i have me completely crushed also a
lot of the hands that he's going to
continue with now i have some backup
equity so my equity when called
barrelling on a brief heart stern it's

[24:31]
barrelling on a brief heart stern it's
going to be lower than for example on a
three of club's turn because let's say
let's say he has ace eight okay and a
tree of club certainly is basically just
always calling nes eight and we do very
well but now that the flush completes he
might fold this ace eight without a
heart and only call with a heart meaning

[24:46]
heart and only call with a heart meaning
that
the continuing rates of hidden is going
to have more equity
meaning that the v of my
in this case thinner value but it's
going to go down so
then checking becomes more attractive

[25:10]
this one's close the ace
9 first tuna off i would have probably

[25:15]
9 first tuna off i would have probably
just folded
if it's a recreational calling i would
have obviously called as well
you can sometimes
start bluffing this i think it's an okay
and

[25:37]
that's a bad river

[25:47]
uh
i don't want to
but i have to
all right with the s9

[26:05]
probably calling the turn
we unblock
lower pairs
we unblock broadways so yeah i think

[26:15]
we unblock broadways so yeah i think
case nine
we block the suited versions
it checks back that's interesting

[26:33]
i would have definitely called here
versus barrel and now i hope to get
caught by and like pocket sixes

[26:54]
and he called me with
rocket sevens

[27:01]
[Music]
this guy is in a snappy mood

[27:15]
i think it he was the same guy with the
ace eight
i'm going to sometimes jam sometimes
call
of the call this time
we flop completely nothing
and i'm going to check fold so we've

[27:30]
and i'm going to check fold so we've
added back to our check race i think
that's fine play
on a queen high board
because the queen i bought this actually
quite good for me

[27:45]
let's say i was in the small blind and
he would seen that board maybe i would
have even checked with ace five ah
that's that
uh ace five diamond that that that that
probably goes a bit too far but the
queen eye board if we're playing small
versus button the queen aboard is very
good for me now it's a little bit

[28:01]
good for me now it's a little bit
less good for me as
bottom versus big blind you're more
inclined to four by the hand like ace
queen off king queen off
whereas first the small blind small
versus button those hands make fine
calls
and that's mainly because the small

[28:16]
and that's mainly because the small
blind prevents a bit more linear
this hence
um
and that's mainly because the the small

[28:30]
and that's mainly because the the small
band range range contains more hands
that we have dominated and the big blind
contains more hands that are suited so
let's say he has 10 8 suited we have a
screen off we don't
obviously
no we don't mind that hand

[28:46]
no we don't mind that hand
obviously you have tenets to the beat
right
but
for example a small blind three bets ace
jack off 100
okay
from the big blind that's another 100
percent rebound
so we much rather call versus a range

[29:01]
so we much rather call versus a range
that has more a check off more king
queen off and we will much rather four
bet hq now versus a range that has more
suited stuff right deny equity so then
the queen
is actually still an okay board for the
button if he orbits against the big

[29:15]
button if he orbits against the big
blind either if he forbids first a small
we have more queen ax
that's one
we have more sixes and fours that's two
and he his four-bed range contains the
squeenex because he's not gonna forbid
ace queen off

[29:30]
ace queen off
he's not gonna always forbade king queen
off
that's why actually that spot should not
get c bet that that often
recover with the h8

[29:45]
recover with the h8
turn is quite dicey whether we should go
or not
yes we're sometimes ahead
but
in order to realize
realize being a hat he has to give up
with king jack jack queen

[30:01]
with king jack jack queen
check 7 check 8.8
naming all these hands
i am tempted to still call
but it's a bit

[30:19]
do you want to make 2022
your greatest poker year ever
now i've done a webinar on how to do
that in our academy which we have made

[30:30]
that in our academy which we have made
available completely for free so go over
to
pokerambition.com and let me help you
achieve your goals
architects

[30:52]
oh sometimes for about this
let's do it this time
you're all high no we didn't roll high

[31:00]
you're all high no we didn't roll high
but you know sometimes you just gotta
feel like it this is the youtube rng
feel the power
you feel my power baby
feel my power
sevens
okay this can get uh this can get dicey

[31:15]
okay this can get uh this can get dicey
unimproved
it didn't improve
return eighth and ninths definitely your
uh
primary candidates okay checks
i think we just have a license to bet
small now
with
range

[31:47]
get pocket sixes
we're gonna kind of cover with queen 10
because the this guy's here
um
interesting board

[32:01]
interesting board
i'm going to lead

[32:15]
to basically get the money in versus
this guy and to deny some equity
i think the turn is a check
the board gets so connected and drawy
again it's similar to an earlier spot i

[32:31]
again it's similar to an earlier spot i
think we had fours right i would much
rather better turn on the five of clubs
than on a seven of diamonds
if you think the opposite
there's
you're underst you're understanding this

[32:45]
you're underst you're understanding this
spot
wrong
again you're betting because the board
becomes scary you want protection but
that's not possible okay he just has
quite a lot of higher equity ends now
and that just means you have to be you
have to slow down a little bit whereas
on a five he doesn't have them

[33:06]
a six can literally go
either way
you can do whatever you want here
what do i want

[33:17]
he bets again
main blocks are gonna be containing a
queen that really sucks
king queen jack queen
king jack
but then again those are quite a lot of

[33:30]
but then again those are quite a lot of
combos i'm just naming
i think i'll call this
50 50.
let's go
the other hand
a6 i'm going to be check calling

[33:45]
i'm going to definitely check all the
turn
with a draw to a very good straight

[34:00]
this is interesting
i think we have to try to get value from
a 9.

[34:24]
unless you think it's a spot where
this is interesting this is a spot that

[34:30]
this is interesting this is a spot that
i would
sometimes check
but solver does not agree with me

[34:46]
but like i understand why i want to
check and i understand why solver
doesn't want to bet
uh doesn't want to bet obviously you
know you just want to
especially when you're in position you
don't want to waste one street to be
able to get money in

[35:00]
able to get money in
versus a range that flushes an ace let's
say he has a good flush and he wants to
check raise the turn and i don't bet the
turn yeah that's gonna cost me quite
some money

[35:26]
going to split the turn here

[35:32]
in between a block and a
pot
two hours ago i think i'm doubting a bit
between 125 and pot and you should have
bet 107 again no 100 how much 1112 or 12

[35:48]
bet 107 again no 100 how much 1112 or 12
and a half
he raises

[36:03]
that's interesting

[36:42]
decide to lead the river

[36:45]
decide to lead the river
on to play
let's take let's let's take a look at
that spot after the session

[37:19]
jacoya with the queen 9
it's not a great turn
but
i said that's not a great turn but we
improved the top part this is actually a

[37:31]
improved the top part this is actually a
very good turn
and depending on the
actually we have a very good hand here
here we get a check jam easy call
and he's pretty

[37:48]
dead actually going to go for the check
here
with the queen 9

[38:02]
and we have easy on the river
okay at ace

[38:16]
four wait we chopped
are you kidding me
so i'm [ __ ] fair man play like a
[ __ ] genius to get down here every
[ __ ] day i think i'm gonna burn this
[ __ ] place down if i don't win this
[ __ ] tournament

[39:09]
yeah i should have probably borrowed
that then jack and reserve my checks for
queen 10 ace king 10.

[39:15]
queen 10 ace king 10.
i was considering a barrel
i don't think that was played very well
i mean obviously jack then you know it
has more equity because we have to got
it to go with it
it needs more protection versus ace king

[39:31]
it needs more protection versus ace king
ace queen as we just saw
[ __ ] a threes
is still a call
i think so

[39:46]
it dies here though
just at a s8

[40:00]
we better ace and suited
we get deeper you want to include a bit
more calling but
definitely
uh do that more with offsuit hands and
hands that don't make the nuts obviously
ace then you flop a flush draw you're
gonna make the nuts

[40:16]
gonna make the nuts
so you can definitely uh continue
be aggressive with your suited aces
but i had like ace jack off king queen
off there i would uh move to my flat
goal
sure
and even ace queen off

[40:32]
and even ace queen off
when we become a big blind steep
or at least a screen off not always
maybe 50 50.
because you also don't want to
lower your treatment that much that he
can just

[40:45]
open relentless
is the hand i'm going to call because
we've become very deep
so making flash over flashes worth more

[41:00]
so making flash over flashes worth more
money this one i'm going to open this
time
so let's go
back to flush
seven eight of diamonds versus my ice
dialed diamonds to make my point

[41:19]
is interesting okay he did not fight
does he have
probably a queen

[41:41]
snap got me on the river so then he
probably had an ace

[41:47]
ace ten
yeah versus ace ten
you should have check based
should we have

[42:22]
go for a check raise here
with some backdoors
check seven eight

[42:45]
i think i'm gonna go for a bet
i think just calling is the way to go

[43:14]
i'm actually going to make a small bed

[43:15]
i'm actually going to make a small bed
here on the river
and i'm going to make a bet here i think
just to make him full pocket sixes
[ __ ] advice this is for example this is
spot nine says i see some people
stab them a bit too much with lower pair

[43:31]
stab them a bit too much with lower pair
so then i think
not checking back ace jack and going for
the bluff i think comes a little bit
better
unless you think that they don't stop
and then call the river and that would
be pretty [ __ ] up
can i have five

[43:45]
can i have five
decent board for me
decent port
if you treat it from the small light as
soon as the two broadways connect then
just

[44:01]
just
quite some padding

[44:15]
this one's really close i'm gonna go for
a bet
these boards you can do whatever you
want
there's a race which i did
sort of take in consideration

[44:31]
but that's fine we can easily call at
least one

[44:46]
he immediately overlaps the turn
i'm gonna fold this hand

[45:04]
that is obviously the downside of
bedding

[45:22]
but unless you think he's doing that
with pure air balls
then i think

[45:33]
we should just fold

[46:38]
okay but
i think
this board you can bet
on turrets you can bet

[46:45]
on turrets you can bet
over bat i see merits in the in both
actually here
i'm definitely going to go for an
overpass
i'm going to get there

[47:06]
is a good river in terms of it improves
jack 9 but he never has check 9.
i do still think he has some hands that
he could

[47:16]
he could
now call me with mainly queen jack i
mean jack has now become quite
attractive

[47:43]
but i think they're actually aces
without the ace of diamonds could

[47:46]
without the ace of diamonds could
actually just uh
just backtake on the flop
h3 if i had a heart on my barrel but

[48:00]
h3 if i had a heart on my barrel but
with the heart
it's fine
x7 let's have actually i don't mind
check raising 10 7 some of the time
let's uh let's just go do that
i'm going to check the a3 hope to win

[48:15]
i'm going to check the a3 hope to win
versus king queen
the good thing with the jack seven is we
we block value and basically
on
six and eight and nine king and a jack
our hand also improves and we have good

[48:30]
our hand also improves and we have good
blocker so
i think it's a fine hand to uh to
sometimes put in your check rating range
because of like we have so many cards
that we can bear on
diamond straight complete the seven and

[48:45]
diamond straight complete the seven and
it's like half the deck
easy bet here at nine's probably going

[49:00]
easy bet here at nine's probably going
to barrel that's the turn as a high card
maybe i would still barrow actually on a
10.
make it then i would probably still
barrel jack
this guy will definitely barrel
probably splitter on the turn

[49:21]
i like a small bit
h5
what do we do with aside

[49:46]
we're gonna go into check i think i
sometimes actually still win this is
king jacking ten as the guys are
recreational
let's drop first a7

[50:00]
like that's the benefit of betting that
turned out versus a recreational
that we can sometimes bluff some rivers
and we actually still have some ev in
the check pack line

[50:17]
value of 91 clearly a recreational
player
e3 bets be very small
or you're maybe recreational watching
the reason why you shouldn't be three
betting small is because basically you
just let me in

[50:31]
just let me in
okay
you let me realize my equity
even if you have a great hand
okay
you don't want a tree that small you
want to charge me
because
i'm not gonna realize with king four i'm

[50:46]
i'm not gonna realize with king four i'm
only going to get my money in when i
have your asus beat
bad flop pair with queens queens would
sometimes race pre-flop sometimes call
he barrels

[51:01]
i think we should just fold
yeah
whatever
um
actually gonna mix in a call here

[51:15]
actually gonna mix in a call here
because the big blinds also recreational
so let's play a butt with all the
recreationals together
going to mix four bat and call here pull
the call

[51:30]
and go to all
you can also just repeat this and that's
perfectly fine but you don't really want
to face a format and then if there's a
recreational big plan to be calling
perfectly fine option
i'm going to check call here with the
as10

[51:50]
this one is quite dicey
next we have a 10.
i think having a 10 i would prefer just

[52:00]
i think having a 10 i would prefer just
betting the river
i'm going to check my

[52:16]
small right five
if you raise the river is uh
and i think on the turn we should be

[52:32]
and i think on the turn we should be
blocking
3.85
now we got a full

[53:08]
all right with the ace 10
easy seabed and barrel
with the ace queen

[53:21]
until we turn the queen

[53:32]
check on a queen

[53:58]
i think we have to be too concerned

[54:01]
i think we have to be too concerned
the six
i'm just gonna block the river
here with ace 10.

[54:32]
let's go by ace king

[54:59]
a bit bigger versus the recreational

[55:05]
and king jack there is like your most
big bet
with ace king you could make an argument
for betting small and letting him
call with his ace highs

[55:17]
i will sometimes call sometimes fault
sometimes do everything
or call this time
actually not everything
and the same now versus squeeze i will

[55:31]
and the same now versus squeeze i will
oh i think 50 50.
57 okay
let's flip a set
the last tip i have for you is on small
pocket pairs
and these are hands that you can win
monster pods so when you get delta

[55:47]
monster pods so when you get delta
pocket pair try to flop a set
play it smooth and win all the money

[56:07]
okay board for my range
resolve but i think we have easy fault

[56:15]
queen then is god
and it's both

[56:38]
you too bad here
yes i suited it enough for the gto kits
let's rip it in the v4 beds shall we do

[56:45]
let's rip it in the v4 beds shall we do
it
just to you know
to satisfy the gto crowd
yeah okay we're gonna satisfy the gto
crowd why not

[57:01]
and satisfy the gto crowd
defaults gto is the way to go
[ __ ] ggo gto has got to go say no to gto
kids

[57:19]
king seven
i'll just call some distributed
i think it's okay candidate to stop

[57:32]
i think it's okay candidate to stop
moving over to a queen
back to flash draw back to straight draw
go for a step skip
you should be check folding some hands
on this board
as the three and the four

[57:47]
as the three and the four
connect decent with the big blind
scaling range and the board is two-tone
[Music]
so our bat should have some
activity there

[58:05]
h5

[58:23]
my hand was h4
like the lower your ace becomes

[58:30]
like the lower your ace becomes
obviously if you have a back door i
think might i find
that
i think here actually i am
all delay

[58:45]
you could also check
to prevent this from happening basically

[59:02]
we still think we have a call

[59:21]
and i'm going to call the river
depending on sizing
here's the 10 jack first over that kind

[59:30]
here's the 10 jack first over that kind
of sucks especially because we have a 10
that's still good
and i think i'm going to call

[59:51]
mainly because we are quite kept and i
was going to say he was going to have
quite some hands
in that region it's quite tempting to
use too much of these hands basically

[1:00:01]
use too much of these hands basically
like the seven eight the eight nine the
nine ten because i'm operating on the
assumption that he's very polarized in
that spot which
combinatorically narrows his value range
of taunt and um could create a bluffing
imbalance if he's not very careful
it's i mean it's

[1:00:17]
it's i mean it's
for example that hand displayed gto okay
the actual hand
but how gto is depends on the frequency
that he's doing that with
and i would say from my experience

[1:00:31]
that
this is not a blo a spot where
it's easy to
it's not a spot where it's hard to
overplot
basically

[1:00:50]
eight for four it's a very good board
for him
in terms of four a huge 4x advantage
also
the five six and the six seven off that
i don't have

[1:01:00]
i don't have
i'm definitely gonna do a lot of
checking
good very bad

[1:01:15]
yeah [ __ ] oh [ __ ] of bad
the bad check
the bat check
obviously because if we now refer if he
an hour of his queen jack for example uh

[1:01:30]
an hour of his queen jack for example uh
if if if
if the river is a queen and he is queen
jack he obviously has me beat
street pair doesn't exist weko
oh oh

[1:01:46]
gonna do some low frequency big betting
here on this board i think this is
actually quite a good candidate

[1:02:01]
now the problem here is that we
definitely don't want to get check
raised
but then again like for example if i
then jack a heart i would not bat but
now we do block the straight

[1:02:17]
now we do block the straight
i'm gonna go for it but if he check
raises i'm not happy we do block a hand
that he could check race with king jack
king queen
yeah this

[1:02:30]
yeah this
also i've had the heart i've had the
club version i would definitely also not
bet but now i figured you know he would
sometimes have clubs himself
yeah and now it really sucks

[1:02:47]
erica you should have thought about that
before you bet it
we ever have the best hand let's say he
has 480 clubs
jack ate a club

[1:03:05]
i guess we do sometimes have the best
hand
it can be very uncommon

[1:03:15]
it can be very uncommon
actually also have me beat
interesting spot
i didn't pay any attention actually to

[1:03:30]
i didn't pay any attention actually to
this hand but that seems to be
[Music]
yeah
chop it up
get lucky

[1:03:47]
i'm curious if i uh if my reasoning was
still right to bet at hand like i said
you don't want to have clubs
and you do want to block at least a
straight

[1:04:08]
i would say queen seven of hearts is
probably your
primary hand that you can still bet

[1:04:15]
and then if we better we bad fault
so
even if we're
even if we haven't beat let's say he has
1080 clubs you know that still has a lot
of equity i don't think i don't think

[1:04:30]
of equity i don't think i don't think
we're going to make it we needed around
i had to close a gap of 10 percent in my
hat
and that 10 would then be hands that we
have beat which are gonna be draws but
yeah yeah

[1:05:15]
interesting

[1:05:39]
i think we're gonna do quite some
leading here he called me with two pair
i'm curious though for my sizing i went
ten percent

[1:05:45]
ten percent
but we do have a nut flush here
like it's it's easy to think with the
nut flush you know that we want to get
more money actually i think the nut
flush wants to check race doesn't want
to lead

[1:06:02]
i when i was checking on the turn i
already had in mind that i could lead
some rivers
and then this river came and i left
but i don't think this is the lead this
is just always a check race
so the first hand i wanted to take a

[1:06:15]
so the first hand i wanted to take a
look at was the eighth deuce of hearts
already set quite a high checking
frequency
the nine eight does also connect with
our range let's say it's eight seven
five you would just check range but we
did go check and check check i'm not
mistaking yes

[1:06:31]
mistaking yes
turn is that queen of diamonds
we have ace deuce or hearts
i don't think we get to fold a lot of
better asex with a bat so that's why i
checked
okay he just wants
that

[1:06:47]
that
i
do not necessarily
agree yes we can fold out ace 4 h5
but that is about it and they don't even

[1:07:01]
but that is about it and they don't even
count because yeah okay it's chop equity
i'm actually not a big bad big fan then
we get raised so i actually don't like
that i prefer way more check calling
maybe dunking some rivers as i mentioned
that was definitely something that i had
in my mind
that's all

[1:07:17]
that's all
yes
oh
a river is that
jackass spade
check a heart sorry i assume we're gonna
do quite some dunking

[1:07:33]
very little dunking actually
and actually acetus of hearts if we did
have it it actually always wants to dunk
that's quite interesting

[1:07:45]
that's quite interesting
once we get 21 in position should
probably still raise some 10x any 10x
and then we can come over the top
okay yeah if he's still raising 10x then
i think dunking is fine
because then we can get over the top and

[1:08:00]
because then we can get over the top and
he should raise uh 10x
i'm i'm really surprised though that we
don't dunk more
i'm really
surprised
i i don't really understand why
we don't want to build a bigger leading
range here on the river

[1:08:16]
range here on the river
i guess that means that he's going to
bluff them with a jack we check to him
no okay
comment down below if you understand why
we don't have

[1:08:30]
we don't have
more of a leading range here
on the river
because i don't get it
but anyway he is going to for example he
had nine six is a head that he's going
to check behind so we did want at least
one big blind of dead hand
uh
in the sim it's dunk betting 21

[1:08:47]
in the sim it's dunk betting 21
it dunk bad
i think then the dunk bat re-race is
gonna be fine just because of the fact
he's just going to check back
way too much hands in my opinion for
example he's no he's betting what's his
worst value bet

[1:09:02]
two pair
they're still betting queen jack
yeah i think people can be quite nitty
on this spot
so i like dunking
you see you don't have to always agree
with the solver

[1:09:16]
with the solver
[ __ ] ggo
even though
the danger in this case is i don't
really understand why we're not doing it
right if i understand why we're not
doing it
and then i still don't want to do it
that's something else
moving on to the next hand the jack 7

[1:09:31]
moving on to the next hand the jack 7
where we started with a big bet on the
flop you can actually see that the
biggest bet
that's being used is like around half
about three quarters
very little over betting
very little betting i did felt jack 7

[1:09:45]
very little betting i did felt jack 7
was a fine candidate to bet a little bit
bigger
we do say that of all the jack sevens
that is kind of the and i had king queen
in my mind as well as a big bad a hand
that clearly wants to bet
on the larger size
but like i said i said oh i remember me

[1:10:00]
but like i said i said oh i remember me
saying unfrequent about the big but i
like this hand for it
so we did go actually with a big bet
and then called
it was a nine
see what we now do jack seven of hearts

[1:10:15]
see what we now do jack seven of hearts
now it's a quite a high frequency check
i did say for example that queen jack or
queen ten of clubs would be the worst
yes these hands definitely not bad and
then queen ada heart was the best
apparently
again clubs do check more than hearts

[1:10:31]
again clubs do check more than hearts
that's kind of what i expected but
apparently we do we just have too much
equity
to bet the term with
i actually thought he should not just
jam king queen or at least
yeah actually i thought that was
probably a play that was going to happen

[1:10:45]
probably a play that was going to happen
but apparently not
maybe against a range that that's a bit
more jack seven of hearts like like i
did in this example actually also
actually if we bet
uh we actually bet at a

[1:11:00]
a smaller sizing
the the three quarters is going to be
more dominant
and we bet
if we have a pair to go with our hand so
like some showdown value
naked flashball but not combo combo draw

[1:11:16]
he jams what do we do with jack seven we
have a fold okay
but we're
we're quite in the ass plate line right
this line doesn't really ex shouldn't
really exist that much in theory let's
say the more common line was the three

[1:11:30]
say the more common line was the three
quarters
and the turn was the nine
check
then we're already more likely to bat
jack seven
because obviously we get check shipped
on less due to the sbr

[1:11:47]
on less due to the sbr
and the main problem the main reason why
we lean towards
betting more air instead of equity is
because of that gem right that folding
now with our draw is is really horrible
yeah i just took the wrong sizing

[1:12:02]
yeah i just took the wrong sizing
i think it just took the wrong sizing
so now let's look at the king seven
eight small first bitcoin where we had
the king queen
we decided to bat small
in queen which in queen definitely have

[1:12:15]
in queen which in queen definitely have
all the hands
you see a decent preference for betting
on the turn i was dialing between 125
and pot and then i said i should go
somewhere in the middle
under 25
is indeed

[1:12:30]
is indeed
the
preferred sizing so
likely
it's played that but you do see like
there's also some three quarters
involved
actually with the exactly my king of
spades hand you see more three quarters
but i'm not gonna be too picky here

[1:12:46]
but i'm not gonna be too picky here
so make it fine then we did go for the
bet
actually to get the race i think the 20
yeah i think this one that makes more
sense
let's take that line
he'd erase what our hands that he should

[1:13:01]
he'd erase what our hands that he should
be
considering small race with
actually you should never small race but
what it did is not really a thing

[1:13:15]
but i was thinking that maybe he would
sometimes race it felt like a bit of uh
in the past okay
but this is this is for the old school
players they talked about the freeze
play and a freeze play
is when you raise the turn to check

[1:13:31]
is when you raise the turn to check
behind the river that's kind of how this
line
felt like to me um like i said it's not
really a thing
versus a bigger sizing
it's sometimes very small
yeah like a four three and a five three

[1:13:46]
yeah like a four three and a five three
so sometimes the bottom pair
seven four spades seven four of hearts
for example indeed is a hand that cannot
really call
so it then sometimes raises
and that's kind of what i put at him on

[1:14:02]
and that's kind of what i put at him on
but let's see
okay let's see he raises small
we're not following king queen obviously
a river
is actually a fourth space that's
interesting

[1:14:16]
interesting
let's say the river is a blank i would
have led here for small sizing
asus wants to lead here for a small
sizing
six five
by four of spades
okay funky

[1:14:32]
king queen never
the forest plate's actually king queen
does something quality but it's the
flush
oh no i'm inventing things that
apparently in theory at least didn't
exist but like i said i put them a bit

[1:14:46]
exist but like i said i put them a bit
more on
[Music]
on a hand
which didn't really want to call but
also didn't really want to fall that's
kind of how this race on the turn felt
like all right well if you gotta read
that okay i i changed my mind if you get

[1:15:00]
that okay i i changed my mind if you get
a read it's good that's how reads work
right i just okay fine everything's
forgivable if you [ __ ] read
um
we can see though that for example i had
like seven eight
wants to try a little blocky i think
that uh that actually makes some sense

[1:15:19]
prevent certain hands for example to
prevent a hand like from king jack
checking behind
if we check and i'm i'm playing around
with these kind of with these kind of
plays a little bit so

[1:15:31]
plays a little bit so
in that
in in the face of playing around you're
going to make some mistakes you know
sometimes you nailed it and sometimes
you're just completely off
and
basically
it's important to just keep on marking
these hands reviewing them and try to

[1:15:45]
these hands reviewing them and try to
learn from them
and he actually just called with king 3
which i would say is a fine play yeah he
just calls me king three i also thought
that on the turn versus this sizing you
know we do we should still do quite some
calling let's say we have 910 and i

[1:16:00]
calling let's say we have 910 and i
don't just want to check behind 910.
yeah you can actually see that here that
oh let's go back
all
four spades
and you can actually see that in the 910

[1:16:15]
and you can actually see that in the 910
is now indeed a hand that calls the turn
and then plus river so it is important
to develop some sort of a leading range
here on the river i think that's pretty
cool
yeah apparently we lead spades but then
okay

[1:16:30]
okay
we know
but this is clearly a bluff
jamming king queen is clearly a bluff
right here space okay so actually we
should have maybe considered bluffing
the river for the o incising
to be fairies in quite a tough spot
with the king of spades okay

[1:16:48]
okay yeah yeah yeah yeah would have been
an option
all right chicken sound for the weko
[Music]

[1:17:01]
[Music]
i hope you guys like this video i think
at the end this analysis let me know
what you guys think of it but i think
this is how your session should look
like before you go play you should have
a certain intention for your session a
big fan of that you should have certain

[1:17:16]
big fan of that you should have certain
improvement points that you're trying to
work on i always ask myself the question
how can this session bring me closer to
my goals okay now of that then come a
couple of focus points that i think i
should focus on and improve upon during
this session spots that come up are an

[1:17:31]
this session spots that come up are an
opportunity to become a better player
and therefore your goals
then while playing obviously you should
be on the lookout for that and you
should be curious and mark spots where
you're like hey
not really sure what to do or hey i'm
curious what uh what my range wants to

[1:17:46]
curious what uh what my range wants to
do where or hey i'm curious what kind of
