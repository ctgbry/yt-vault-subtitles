welcome back to another episode here on
the mechanics of poker podcast in
today's podcast we are making the jump
to the mtt world and who better to do
this with than patrick leonard aka pats
he has been playing poker for over 12
years and i have to say i've rarely seen
someone who gets such a smile on his
face from poker strategy as patrick
especially when it comes down to icm
a very passionate guy about the game
more recently has also drawn a lot of
attention with his social media use
mainly posting his sunday stories on
instagram where he waits for a nice beat
to drop before making calls in general
uh this is a way of expressing himself
really showing his passion about the
game a lot of fun when i think about
patrick i think think about a fun guy
playing poker what's your thoughts on
that adam
yeah i think pad says so much passion
for the game he's been around for a long
time he's been the top of the mtt world
for pretty much the last eight ten to
ten years see i'm really fascinated how
he's kept that motivation passion and
drive for the game yeah i'm looking
forward to uh diving into how he made
his journey to the top all the lessons
he's learned and yeah hopefully we
instill some good lessons for the
audience what are you most excited about
for today's guest
someone with his level of experience and
also you know poker changes a lot over
the years and what you often see is that
people who started back when he started
they kind of stopped at some point right
they you often say that poker in the
past was easier and when stuff got a bit
harder people often kind of build but he
didn't so clearly a very i think his
passion really helped him a lot
in that as well he also did a lot of
coaching so yeah a lot of experience so
without further ado let's have pats on
welcome patrick to the podcast
good to be here good to be here i've
seen bits and bobs of all all the
podcasts you've done so far um i only
watch podcasts which have time stamps
that's kind of my rule so i really love
that you guys have time stamps because
it means i can just watch you know 15
minutes here 10 minutes here 20 minutes
here and like little segments which i
think is a really good way to do it so
uh thanks for doing the time stamps for
the other ones
no worries no worries i mean i'm similar
as you so it was also kind of out of my
own need and i'm sure a lot of poker
players you know our attention spans
nowadays are at the highest to just sit
down and listen to two and a half hours
of podcast so people kind of want to
browse through through stuff so i think
that's a good addition to the pod
i wanted to start off with
an observation that i made i saw you
were a big newcastle united fan
happy with this yes uh transfer window
and the changes in general that are
going on at the club
yeah yeah for sure for sure it's uh i
was i was prepared to be the richest
club in the world in the second division
of uh in england but fortunately it
looks like things might be okay after
all so uh so yeah i'm looking forward to
uh to probably go into some european
games and the not so distant futures uh
hopefully maybe don't jinx it but
that would be nice
yeah they came out firing uh straight
away uh
i saw trippier was the hero in the last
match if i'm not mistaking do you think
uh how many years do you think it will
take for newcastle to compete for the
title um
i would imagine something like
six seven ish
that's like 12 transfer windows so it's
like a billion pounds if you do 100
million per transfer window so i think
my manchester city squad is worth around
about a billion pounds so to assemble a
squad to compete i imagine it will take
around about
six or seven years
i mean
money is not everything i'm personally a
united fan and they blasted i don't know
how much money and look and look what
kind of team they put together so it
also kind of depends which players
you're going to buy from from experience
from a fr this is from this comes from a
frustrated fan
adam do you actually actually i don't
know do you actually like football adam
i do i'm a newcastle fan myself it's
very difficult to watch any of the games
in bali because they're on it like three
in the morning but yeah i follow the
scores i'm a bit of a bbc sport advocate
i always know the ratings and how the
team is doing and yeah we finally got
something to shout about at the moment
which is great so pads uh you've had a
good sporting background and you still
love playing football yourself so that
was through that when you're when you
start playing football what age were you
competitive as a footballer
um i guess i started playing when i was
around about five six just
you know in like
you used to go to like a camp i guess in
summer and uh
i think in america you have like camps
in summer where you go away to
to like
almost like a scout camp you know like
you go away like in a in a
hot or something with loads of other
kids but in england it's very different
i think the only camps they have in
england are like sport camps really like
you just have like a football camp in
newcastle at least everyone i knew in
summer you just went and played football
for like six weeks in england you have
this thing called the six weeks holiday
it's like um
everyone looks forward to it all yeah
it's like oh how long till the six weeks
holiday and uh
at least in where i'm from newcastle
everyone just went and played football
for six weeks so i think probably the
first
time i went to school i guess you're
like six so like yeah one a reception
you had your first six weeks holiday
then i just played football for six
weeks then and then since then i played
i played basically six days a week from
five years old till
i was like 18 i guess um i started to do
running when i guess i was like 12 or 13
so i would run
um
i would run basically four times a week
and i'd play football six times a week i
was doing like double sessions uh this
is when i was like 12 13 so um i was
very obsessive um
i wasn't like forced to do from my
parents but i was extremely encouraged
like they would rather i was doing that
than you know like being on the streets
or whatever uh and when you're like 12
you have all the energy in the world
it's not like it's grueling to do two
sessions you just you can just run for
like four hours you have so much energy
um so from a very early age i was always
no days off just
but not in a way where i felt like i was
working it felt like it was just fun and
then i think
um like going all the way back like
all the way forward to like now i can
play like 60 days in a row and i think a
lot of it comes because when i was
12 13 8 whatever it may be it was very
natural for me to just play football for
like 50 uh 365 days in a row so like it
doesn't feel when you're doing something
you like it doesn't really feel like
work because if i took a day off playing
football for like an academy or
for my school or whatever i would just
be playing football with my friends like
in the park you know my days off would
be playing football and i find a lot of
the time in poker when you take a day
off now
i'm usually doing something poker
related anyway maybe i'm watching like
high stakes poker maybe i'm watching a
podcast with you guys maybe i'm you know
going over hand history whatever it may
be and i feel like um there's a lot of
similarities between you know like poker
now and then football when i was like
five or six maybe that's why i'm like
very obsessive so so far down the line
you know whereas if i played one day a
week football just for fun maybe it
would be different now in poker you know
um so yeah yeah so you had that passion
for football when you're young and it
seems like that passion at some point
transitioned into poker me and renee
were just chatting off the air like one
of the things we both respect about you
is your passion for the game which just
doesn't waver after all these years if
anything gets stronger so when did your
passion for sports start to maybe wear a
little bit and when did the early career
start for you
so um
when you like uh
15 16 in england you have to decide what
you're gonna do next so you either stay
on at school like go to sixth form which
is basically like college um you can go
to like a separate college which is like
specialist or you can get a job as like
a labor like a plumber or a builder or
something like this so when i was 15 or
16 all of my friends i didn't really
like school because i have um like an
obsessive
i can't just do one thing at once you
know if i i can't just listen to a
teacher speaking to me for an hour i
have to be doing multiple things if i'm
watching a training video i'm also like
doing things on the side whatever is now
but at the time i just couldn't behave
in school because i couldn't listen to
the teacher it wasn't like i was like a
bad kid or anything i just literally
couldn't listen to someone for an hour
speak to you and in school you do
lessons of one hour in england it's like
nine till ten ten till eleven eleven
till twelve and i just couldn't it was
just so boring for me um i did well at
school not like amazing but all my
friends like my social circle they
they were all like very very good at
school like straight a students and they
all wanted to do like finance economics
like uh
like good degrees you know so they
stayed on at school and did
that and i went to like a specialist
college to do sports i went to gateshead
college actually you may know which is
like basically a sports college um and i
was running and playing football so um
so
i basically left my friends then and
they would they would basically really
love poker so in between the economics
lessons or whatever they were not sure
you can hear my dog in the background um
in between their lessons they will play
poker all the time but they were still
my best friend so i wanted to still be
with them so when they left school in
the evening they would go home and
continue the poker games because people
would be stuck like someone would be
down 20 so they wanted to win it back so
when i message them saying hey do you
want to come and play football do you
want to come and
do whatever they were like oh no we're
gonna play poker so um
so i would go and play with them and i
had no idea what i was doing obviously
because they would if in terms of volume
they would play you know like six hours
a day and i would play an hour with them
after school so i would just lose lose
lose and um
i don't i don't think anyone likes
losing i don't think it's like specific
to me but nobody likes to just lose
especially in front of all my friends
you know maybe you make a play which is
really bad and everyone kind of laughs
at you because they're all more advanced
than you are um
and it's not a very nice feeling so i
just decided to to learn to beat my
friends you know like uh
out of almost embarrassment i would say
um i didn't like poker i hated it i wish
we were going nightclub and i wish we
were playing football or wish we were
doing something a bit quicker because
poker was so slow like i said in school
like listening to a teacher i can't do
going to university i couldn't go to
lectures i had to walk out i just it
wasn't it wasn't like an arrogance thing
or anything i just i wasn't learning
that way so when when you played live
poker with your friends who are like
playing so slow maybe like having a beer
in the middle of a hand or whatever
every hat you'd maybe play like 10 hands
an hour 15 hands an hour um at the most
and it was just so boring for me because
like i said i just it's i need things i
need so much stuff to be going on for my
mind to start to work so i hated it
really um i hated poker at start but um
yeah that's how that's how it all
started at least why did you start to
love it
um
i guess
i started to basically not really love
playing i didn't really love playing i
started to love
reading about poker so i would basically
again i had a job um and in my job i
couldn't just do my job because i can't
do one thing at once so i'd basically
have my if you have like a monitor on
half of my screen i would have my job as
in finance journalism and on the other
half of my screen i had two plus two and
i would just look through hand histories
all day so i would start to really love
poker uh in terms of reading about it in
term but it was just a way of basically
satisfying my um
not boredom but my attention span you
know i need i needed something on the
side of my work so that i could actually
work because i couldn't i would have to
leave my job because i can't just do one
thing at once i should have this weird
weird mind like that so um
yeah i would i was basically like a two
plus two addict from like let's say
1617 to like 20 i would read two plus
two or other forums for all day you know
just read hand industries retail
industries retail industries at this
time like tom dwan ike
scott siva these kind of guys were
posting every single day on two plus two
so the information you could read was
really really high level everyone gave
out all the information this is now like
16 years ago so um
yeah and then i would find other forums
um like blonde poker in the uk um i
would start
as time would go on um i would be
refreshing pages so frequently that
there was no industries left i started
to it's quite a funny joke between my
friends but i would start going on like
gypsy team it's like a russian forum and
i started to go on french forums and i'd
translate the whole forum on like you
know on google chrome translate and i'll
just read hand histories all day from
russian forums french forums two plus
two forums i wasn't really a profitable
player i wasn't really making money i
wasn't even really grinding because i
had a job but i would spend all day at
this job you know nine till five reading
industries uh and that started you know
basically when i was 18 whatever
and yeah so i started to fall in love
with it that way um as a way basically
to just
conquer my my boredom or whatever with
life so yeah at what point did things
start to uh get a bit of traction and
you realize wait a second roland's been
obsessed with this game the hardest to
handle streets i actually beat this game
and get good at it when was that gonna
transition moment
so
like at this point when i was 21
i i had like a really high
post count on forums so basically
i was posting all day reading all day i
knew everyone uh and a job came up at
pokerstrategy.com
they were the biggest poker company in
the world by far like uh we had nine
million members um
within all the forums and all the people
signed up like nine million is huge
right this is like pre black friday so
job came up there and i applied for the
job didn't really think i would get it
and i got job which was in gibraltar
spain so
this was now a way of basically poker
basically um
i could basically do what i was doing at
my other job just full time with poker
so
when i went to this job at
pokestrategy.com i'd be doing my job but
this same thing happened in my mind i
need to be doing something else on the
side so i would have basically like
my job on half my monitor then on the
other half of the monitor i would have
like four tables of like rush poker it's
like zoom but on full tilt at the time
and in a normal job let's say you work
in a bank if your boss comes around and
sees you have four tables of poker
you're gonna get fired right but my
bosses would come around and they'd be
proud that i was playing poker on the
side right because
most people who work in poker companies
they're not profitable poker players
they're like
like the average guy who works let's say
pokestars he's he doesn't play poker
professionally or profitably because
that's why he works in the i don't mean
this in a condescending manner but
they're like they're office workers
rather than poker players but my bosses
really love that i was a poker player
almost they they saw me as a poker
player rather than let's say an employee
where really like i wasn't really that
big of a poker player at the time um but
i would start to play four tables on the
side my bosses would come around every
30 minutes like sweating hands with me
and i was like wow like i can get away
with doing my job on one side and then
conquering my boredom with four tables
of rush poker on the other side and it
was like the perfect mix for me um
i didn't really have a bankroll at this
point because
you know i wasn't really playing poker
you know like when i was like 16 17 18 i
wasn't like building up from nl25 so i
basically
i i was getting paid good money at pogue
stretch i think i was getting like 5k a
month which 21 years old it was pretty
good um and i basically just deposited
straight away to play 100 zoom or 100
rush or whatever it was or 200 rush with
let's say you know like 10 15 buy and
then just like to spin it up uh so i
never did the grind of like
10 and l 25 and l 50 and l 100 now um i
quickly realized
that was both a good thing and a bad
thing the bad thing was i didn't have a
game plan because i realized all the
hand histories i read were big pots so
whenever anyone posted a hand stream on
two plus two it wasn't a six big blind
pot or a four big blind pot it was like
a 60 big blind pot or an 80 big blind
pot or a 500 big blind pot so i
i knew really well how to play huge pots
but i had no idea about like a
specific game plan or general game plan
there was no solvers or anything this is
a long long time ago so i would play 100
zoom four tables or whatever
and i had no idea about c button you
know like i had no idea about defending
the big blind i had no idea really about
rangers i didn't know which hands to
play really but i knew what people's
thought processes were in big pots so i
made a game plan for myself at the time
um
like i said i used to read a lot so
there used to be i'm not sure if you
guys remember there used to be there
used to be two main theories on two plus
two one was called beluga theorem beluga
theorem was
uh if somebody raises on the turn and
you have two pair and you have less than
two pair always fold that was like a
specific rule at six max cache and zebo
theorem was if anyone ever improves to a
full house
on that street they won't fold no matter
how much you bet so these were the two
theories which i built my game around um
so
basically whenever i got to the turn
and it was a spot where i thought it was
tough for someone to have better than
a's better than aces i would always play
very very aggressively so if i defended
the big blind uh wacko raises the button
uh wacko raises under the gun i call he
see bets jack high board the turns a
brick if you bet the turn i would start
turning all my jacks into a bluff just
like ridiculously aggressive whatever um
because i thought well the theory is or
the meta game is that you know you have
to fold aces it you have to fold aces
because people only raise turns with two
peplus so i just bluffed basically for
four or five months always bluffing uh
always turning every single hand into a
bluff i don't think i
made a single bluff catch in the first
three or four months of my career i
always would turn every one pair into a
bluff uh and because i was kind of new
to the pool and the pools were so big
because it's free black friday
and because the population played so
passively
i managed to be to become a pretty
decent winner um even though i had no
specific game plan i didn't know which
hands to raise from each position i
didn't have a coach i didn't have a
community or whatever but i'd read maybe
like
ten thousand hand issues at this time
and they were all big pots so i became
like a big pot player
so it was really bad in small pots and i
had this really tight style uh like a
really nitty style pre-flop but i was
like crazy at the same time so it was
like a i must have been a really weird
player to play against because i played
no hands but if i played them i played
them strong you know
so uh so yeah when people saw their huds
and they saw this guy like i was like
1914 or whatever they were oh this guy's
a knit he has to have it but i was just
bluffing bluffing bluff and bluffing um
so yeah that was basically my style from
a very very early age uh in poker
yeah love it and when did you start to
get very competitive i know your
personality types you like compete you
like to be people when did that start to
come into your strategy and your
approach to poca when you wanted to to
get better
so
i i was playing micro gaming at this
time i moved to michael german um
i moved very quickly from like 50 51
this in like 50 cents one dollar
to 510 within like
i'd say maybe like a month six weeks
like running well you know like
playing well mike gaming had no hoods i
think at the time or
you were anonymous no one really knew
who you were i was actually playing
anonymous tables as well so i built a
roll-up very quickly from let's say like
2k to
like 30k i think something like that and
again you know these numbers could be
like slightly more slightly less i'm not
sure this is
more than 15 years ago but it was it was
something around about that and
i'd never had money before in my life
ever i'd never had more than you know
like a thousand dollars in my bank or
whatever so
i really wanted to protect this money
you know like i had this bankroll i
wasn't trying to you know like gamble it
all up i was trying to
i was trying to just
i i was very happy to have a bankroll
because when i was 18 19 17
i was reading all these two plus two
threads thinking i'm amazing at poker
but i felt too much of an ego to play
like 10 and l and build my bank roll ups
i was like oh i wish i had two thousand
dollars so i could grind i wish i had
five thousand dollars so i could grind
so i spent literally three or four years
like wishing i had a bankroll but not
putting the effort in because i was
doing so much sport and university and
jobs and whatever else um
so i never put the effort in to build a
bankroll but i also if i had a bankroll
i would be better than these guys you
know that kind of logic like obviously
completely wrong um but so once i got my
bank i really wanted to protect it i did
everything not to go broke and i think
i think every month of my life from
probably 21 till like
30 i think i net my bankroll never
went down like at the end of month to
month which was in the end the biggest
leak of my career because i didn't take
big enough shots i sold too much action
in certain spots but my whole
investment strategy was
uh basically
never to go down like i just couldn't i
hated to see my money going down you
know like it was which is a very fishy
logic because when you're 21 22 23 you
can always build it back like going
broke is fine you know it's uh i wish
i'd kind of tried to race to 100k or
raise the 250k a lot quicker than i did
but
you know when i just didn't i just
didn't so at this point they you said
where's the competitive part of me the
the main competition was with myself it
was like i i felt like i was fighting
against myself not to become a dj and um
at this time again i'm working at poker
strategy so
my girlfriend at the time she was the
vip manager for poker strategy of nine
million members the top 100 members are
probably like the highest stake guys in
the world at this time you had people
like phil gruesome igor kurganov they
all came from this german german
background of pokerstrategy.com so
whenever we went home um
so basically my job was head of
education so like ahead of the videos we
put out so
my day-to-day work would basically be
like jungle man would send us a video i
would have jungle man on one side of my
screen i'd be watching his videos on the
other side of my screen i would be
playing four tables of whatever uh
and then we would have a forum where we
paid professionals one dollar to reply
to every post so and then i had to
evaluate these guys so it's loads of
things going on but basically
an nl50 guy would post a hand history an
nl100 guy would reply we would pay that
guy one dollar
and then i was his boss i would have to
read all the threads he did so
i would be again i was still in this
phase of reading thousands and thousands
and thousands of pocahontas trees so i
would go home to dinner 6 p.m 7 p.m sit
with my girlfriend at the table she was
a vip manager so she would tell me oh
this guy went broke today oh my god this
guy went broke today this guy lost his
money on roulette this guy
this guy's wife took his money this
whatever it may be i was just hearing
these stories over and over from my
girlfriend that people were losing money
people were losing money and because i
was quite new to money it's not huge
money but you know 20k whatever it was
to me it felt like everything in the
world i would that made me scared of
losing because she told me all these
guys who i'm seeing as the top players
in the world she's telling me they've
lost their bankroll today they've lost
their bankroll today and i was like wow
people don't realize what poker players
are actually going through there was no
mental game coaches at this time there's
no one like adam or james or elliot that
these people didn't exist so people were
basically confident in vip managers um
so yeah i i had a lot of fear from a
very early age about losing money i
think
yeah and that led you to be quite
risk-averse and sounded from the from
what two choices you made yeah right if
you've got any questions do you wanna
jump in right now
no i can i can actually relate to pets
as well in the beginning of my career i
went uh i went broke a couple times and
that definitely i can relate to that
that definitely leaves some scars in
terms of that you're a bit more careful
like you don't want to re-experience
what you've experienced back then right
for you i guess it was a bit more of a
threat based on stories you heard of
other people for me it was
more of a threat like i don't want that
to happen again so you try to do
everything in your power for that not to
happen again but it's actually
interesting to hear that
uh people obviously nowadays know you as
an mtt player
but in the beginning you were actually
playing rush you know it's a cash game
format when you transition to micro
gaming you mentioned like 510 also cash
game format
when did you
uh so you're mainly playing cash games
but you were still working at poker
strategy when did you transition
into becoming like a professional poker
player so when did you kind of leave
your job in poker strategy in order to
become a professional
sure so i was basically playing
professionally um at my job so i i was
playing as much volume as any
professional cash game grinder at the
time but i had the security of my job
which i really loved again you know like
risk averse um not throwing all my eggs
into one basket kind of thing my parents
i like the fact that you know when you
leave university most people i think the
average wage in the uk is probably like
at this time at least it was probably
something like 15 to 20k so i felt
really like proud you know i'm making
50k i'm 21. like that was something i
didn't really want to give up on even
though i was making probably somewhere
between like
1k to 10k a month in poker as well like
it felt to me oh wow let's keep this job
let's see where this goes i was i was
moving kind of up in the company i
started off in like
a lowest position and they saw
whatever i moved up and up and up and
that now i'm in like a good position
i've had a few pay rises at this point
uh i'm living in spain you know like my
friends are in the uk it's terrible
weather i'm like oh this is great i'm
seeing the world i have a good job i'm
making money playing poker i'm 21 this
is great and then one day
uh poker became illegal in spain um
you know the regulated markets this
happened i guess when i was this
happened
like 11 years ago which is crazy to
think but spanish players used to be
able to play on poker stars or whatever
and that's all micro gaming or ipoker
full tilt um and then one day spain said
no no we're closing the doors so
that was a big blow for me because poke
strategy was based there so i had to
make a decision actors decide okay i
stay in my job i basically quit poker um
playing poker i try to get a job you
know
have a goal of maybe making 100k a year
like you know like a senior level
position there or
do i go and try to do this full-time um
my girlfriend again she was looking
after all the supernova elites
and they were the guys who were like a
lot higher than me i felt these are the
serious guys you know like these are the
professionals if you're supernova lee i
think you used to get
was it 100k at the end of the year or
something like 200k
so i felt like well this is a salary you
know like that is the comfort zone that
is the safety net of a salary even if it
goes bad or whatever
if i put the work in i know i can do
better than these guys because they have
such huge mental game problems at least
that's what i was hearing i was like i
can do this like i feel prepared for
this so
we decided to move to hungary which is
where my girlfriend was from and
we yeah we moved to hungary and i
decided to go for supernova elite but we
moved to hungary i think
let's just i don't know which month so
anywhere between say march to august i
don't know like the middle of the year
so i decided i'm gonna spend six months
to
get a game plan because i realized i
didn't really have a game plan at this
point you know i was just a big i was
still a big pop player it was like big
pop pads at the time i'm going to go to
hungary and i'm going to start to play
some small pots uh
and yeah i basically just started to
learn a bit more i got some coaching
from i'm not sure you know this guy uh
internet paul otto
yeah yeah yeah
german guy right
german guy he was like known as the
theory guy
uh at the time and i was like i wasn't
the theory i was big pop pods right um
so
i i um i got some coaching from him i
started to had more times i'd watch
again you know training videos at the
time was always people showing like huge
hands like to me poker was just like
this huge hand game i didn't really even
think about small pots it wasn't i don't
think small pop poking really came
around properly until solvers came
around where people started talking
about like betting your range 30 on on
flops and stuff like that that really
wasn't a thing people just used about
half pot if they see bet they bit half
pot and then you went from there there
was no real
of course there was guys you know i'm
talking about i'm playing one two two
four three six at the time of course
there was guys playing 25 50 who were on
a deeper level but the time the standard
theoretically was very very low you know
um so i went to hungary i spent a few
months getting better at poker because i
i don't think i was a great poker player
at this time uh
and then january came around i was
prepared i was ready and i was like
going for supernova elite so i would
play eight tables of zoom which is quite
difficult but from an early part of my
career i realized volume is everything
like even to now that's my biggest
strength in poker it's not about
it's not about how i play it's not about
why i know it's all about volume for me
i think that's my strongest strongest
attribute as a player so i realized
early on i need to get good at volume in
zoom to get supernova elite so
for those six months i learned to go
from two tables of zoom to four tables
from four tables to six tables from six
tables to eight tables i didn't just
start eight tabling uh and then
every day it sounds this sounds crazy
and i wouldn't recommend it to your
viewers but i would have
i would start my session before my
session i would have uh two smirnoff
ices do you know what smithify says yeah
it's like uh
it's like um it's like an alcoholic
poison for for great poker right it
gives me well it gives me the buzz with
big pots it made me play some big pots
uh i would have two smell of ices i
would load up my eight tables of zoom or
rush and i would keep playing and if i
was losing i'll just keep playing until
i got back to even
and that was my plan every day for and i
did that for i think
two months ish two months two months
time uh
and then
story is quite well known whatever now
but i went to uh i basically played one
sunday i never really played sundays at
the time i played one sunday uh in
england uh in a hotel room and i played
probably 10 tournaments
and i won three tournaments out of 10
which is obviously crazy look at at this
point i'm terrible at torments i have no
idea about stuck i've never played with
less than 100 big blinds ever like you
can't really play big pots when you have
10 big blinds you know this was not my
forte at all so i had this crazy run and
i was like wow i hate i was like okay
i've made like 60k here which was
probably doubled my bankroll i guess at
the time-ish um
but i was like
i still don't like these thomas i went
back i played if my eight tables spin
off isis uh for the next week sunday
came around i was like okay i'll give
back 2k more to these guys you know they
deserve
i feel guilty hit and running or
whatever um and then i won two
tournaments that day again for like 60k
and i'm like again i'm i have a blog at
this point i'm like tournaments are
stupid i just ran i i was realizing i
was running good
and then the next week uh i was like
okay well i'll give a bit more back
again and it was the anniversary sunday
million um i'm not sure you guys it
still goes on now right it's like 10
billion guarantee whatever so i i final
table this i come uh it's like
40 000 runners whatever right i come
ninth for 100k
so
uh at this point i now have like a
bankroll of 300k ish or like maybe 250k
where that was my goal for the whole
year to grind supernova elite get paid
this 200k at the end of the year and
have like a proper bankroll like that
and like maybe i don't buy a house or
whatever the whole idea was grind a year
every day re-evaluate at the end of the
year show my parents my graph of the
rake back and everything like prove to
my girlfriend prove to everyone okay
this is a career like i've been a
professional about it but then within
three weeks at the start of the year i
basically
achieve more than that amount of money
and then i have to decide okay do i play
cash or do i play tournaments um i don't
think my game was very good for cash i
wasn't like the biggest i was not a huge
crusher at 500 zoom or anything like at
all my game was fully fully like
big pop pads you know like i liked i
didn't really enjoy the whole like
mechanical part of you know like small
race i used i didn't really like to
raise the button with 10 line offset i'd
rather fold 10 line offset on the button
or i'd rather fold king 10 offset on the
button and get dell's pocket sevens
under the gun so i could flop a set you
know like i didn't i i wasn't stimulated
by playing these like
i didn't want to grind it out out like
this even if i was telling myself in
inside that this is what i wanted to do
be supernova elite be the grinder
deep down i didn't enjoy that part of
poker you know um
i used to cold call free bets with any
pocket pair like so if it went raise
under the gun free bet hijack i would
cold call like falls plus on the button
like if we were more than 100 big blinds
deep because maybe i can flop a set
maybe i can play a big pot you know so
i i wasn't really well suited to cash
games you know um i'd done well out of
them but that was just because the pool
was so bad
if i hadn't done well at tournaments and
solvers came around
if i didn't adapt to the solvers or if i
didn't download solvers or whatever i
would have been wiped out i wouldn't
have i would have been i would have been
one of those guys who basically got
made to go back to get a job you know
because it wasn't it wasn't really
suited for me at the time um
i wasn't really prepared to put the work
into from a studying point of view i
wanted to play play play play play all
day every day um
i would have been wiped out basically so
i was so lucky from a tournament point
of view that i had these wins not
necessarily for the money but for my
longevity in poker because i don't think
i would have been around because solvers
probably came out
i guess
two years afterwards or something like
this and i would have just got destroyed
once people started range zebra and then
all this kind of stuff because
i i wouldn't have done it i would have
still i think had that it's not it
wasn't really a degenerate side because
i wasn't chasing money but i i would
have had my game the way that i like to
play wouldn't have been
well suited to that i don't think um
but yeah
that's with hindsight looking back now i
didn't notice at the time obviously
you were trying to get yourself in spots
where you felt like you had a hatch and
that was big pots right that's where you
had all the experience so it's like okay
i need to get in big pots because that's
where i know what to do
exactly exactly um and it wasn't that i
knew what i needed to do it's what i
knew what other people would do because
um
again at this point i've literally
probably
read 50 000 hand histories like a lot
you know probably more probably more and
most people have probably read less than
you know a thousand at this point like i
really
at this point i think when i'm 23 years
old i've i would guess
this is not like ego arrogant or
anything it's just i think i've at this
point i've read more industries in the
world than anybody else at 23. i'm not
i'm not an amazing poker player i don't
have a great technical game i don't i'm
not well studied i don't have i'm not
using so there isn't solvers to use um
i'm i'm not thinking in maths i'm not
thinking in pot odds i never ever looked
at potlucks ever before i was 23 ever
like my whole game was just knowing what
other people thought in big pots and
making them fold or fold in my range uh
and that was enough to be a decent
winner because you know when you play in
50 60 70 big blind pots if you're making
really good decisions in these pots
it doesn't matter too much if you're
losing you know like 0.5 bb here 0.5 bb
here um especially when everyone else is
playing small pots quite badly too
people are missing range c bets against
me people are not check raising the big
blind against me people are not
punishing my like very face obsessions
on the flop of the turn which i'm not
caring about you know so
yeah basically basically uh that's how
it is uh that's how it was i guess
yeah i mean and it's still the same
today right it's not about being the
best poker players being about being
better than your competition so you
might reflect on it to be like wow it
was quite bad but then again the rest
was significantly worse
it's quite interesting also that you
said because normally people kind of at
some point have their job be in the way
of their poker career but because of the
job that you had it kind of contributed
to your poker career so that's also why
you
kind of could be a pro and have your job
which was uh
yeah a very good position to be in
i would say when you transitioned to
tournaments what were some of the things
that what are some of the difficulties
you ran into transitioning from cash to
tournaments
so
i remember very vividly
i played a hand against european
uh who's now like my best friend in
poker let's say but this was 11 years
ago i think maybe 10 years ago i'm not
sure exactly but we played a pot where
basically i raised
i think he he jammed he jammed let's
just say he jumped anywhere between 15
to 30 big blinds i made a call with
whatever hand i made a call with
and then he wrote me the next day
he wrote me the next day and he's like
uh
he at the time sam was funny he just
like dude you can't call that like what
are you doing and then i was like
i was like i was like well i don't know
i don't know can i i don't know i'd
never looked at anything before i was
just playing off i was just playing off
you know feeling uh and then i i replied
to him because i respected him i knew he
was very good and he was very he was
quite studied and stuff uh he was
running like
isomizer i guess was out at the time uh
and i replied back oh i have a read on
you like i have a note and i made up
like a fake note and sent in the
screenshot of like me raised of him like
shoving like a bad hand for this amount
of big blinds it was like european uh
jams ace doosan for 36 big blinds
whatever it may be i sent it to him so
then i kind of realized okay like i need
to get a bit better because the other
regs think i'm quite bad so that was
like an egotistical thing um
[Music]
so
i started to speak more to european so
i'm after he reached out then and then
we started to
speak more and we realized that we
thought quite similar about the game
actually even though like he thought i
played bad in the hand we had very
similar uh
very similar opinions on how population
played he's a very observant guy so
although he hadn't read you know 50 000
hand histories whatever he just picked
it up himself um he picked it up himself
just from
being observant and watching and we
realized we have very similar thoughts
on how people are playing um
so we started speaking every day and
then we were like
for our age we had too much money but
there was no
high games to play like that the highest
tournament a week was like
maybe like 400 500 once a week like
there was no like
10ks 5k so we were like
very young we had a lot of money but we
were quite risk averse so like we
weren't
trying to spin it up in high stakes cash
games so we weren't trying to play super
high rollers in berlin or something like
this so we had too much money for our
age but we thought we had a strategy
which worked against population because
there was no solvers so we were like
let's put our money together
uh give it to other people
tell them what we do
tell them the reads we have on the
population and they will do it and then
we can just turn you know 500k into a
million whatever it may be uh that's
what we did we made um
we made a stake in team and he was like
i have this guy who's a bit older a bit
more like been around longer than we
have uh he's like we we were very new
we'd been playing for like two years
let's say but there's a guy been playing
for like six years called elmerix who
was finnish as well he was like let's
bring him in he's a bit more
uh not serious but he's a bit more
experienced than us and let's do is a
trio i'd never met elmix before but i
was like sure let's do it and then we
made bitby which was mistaken team and
we
we started with like five ten guys let's
say
um
and we start with like five ten guys we
give them our strategy and it worked
really well from straight away uh and
yeah that's that's basically what we did
okay interesting so basically you were
trying to
look how you could optimize your hourly
but given the cap of tournament buyings
there were they were like okay grinding
more for us it's not gonna contribute to
necessarily more money let's
teach what we know to other players let
them grind more at the stakes that they
were and this way we can have a higher
hourly basically yeah so basically i was
doing exactly the same in tottenham you
know tournaments are always like two
years buying cash games so like if cash
game guys work out how to bet big on
like nine high boards or eight high
boards because you want to put in lots
of money with your overpass and your top
pairs you want to clean your outs when
you have jack 10 making jack fold like
that will come in cash games and say
2016 it will come in 12 minutes in 2017
or 18. you know so
cash games are always
one or two years ahead of tournaments so
when i went into tournaments i was using
the same things from cash games to play
the tournament so i was using the same
strategies essentially and i think after
after
six months of playing tournaments i was
number one in the world in tournaments
i'd never played a tournament before so
i got to number one in the world really
quickly
without knowing how to play tournaments
you know i didn't know
i didn't i didn't do any studying of
less than 30 big blinds pre-flop or post
swap all i was doing was
putting all of these cash game
again all these handy shoes i've ever
read on all these forums they were only
cash game industries not tournaments so
all this information i kind of had sorry
all this information i kind of had i put
these from
into tournaments straight away and just
rolled it out for six months i've left
everyone on every turn i've left
everyone on every river i never bluff
captured a tall at this point i turned
everything into a bluff uh
and
six months basically people folded every
spot to me uh
and
yeah i got to number one in the world by
like
this supernova yeah i think i was number
one in the world by like september and i
think i didn't start this tournament
grind until like february-ish so
everything is completely different to
how i planned it in january you know
from this whole supernova really grind
whatever so actually the things that
made you a very good cash game player
were very easily
transitioned into tournaments because it
was more it wasn't necessarily certain
strategic things it was an overall
principle of i'm going to be very
aggressive because the pool overfalls
and i'm going to overfall when the pool
is very aggressive because they're too
passive which applied i mean it came
from human nature right so it applied to
both cash games and tournaments but i i
was not an aggressive player i just i
was very i was if people looked at me i
was very tight i i rfid more than less
than they did you know i i see that the
flop less than they did i didn't do
constant small aggression it was big it
was still big pop pads you know like i i
wasn't i wasn't an aggressive player
really like
to i was like if i looked at my stats i
would have probably had like a
50 percent silver imposition i i'm just
making numbers up but 50 cv position
like a an rfi on the button of maybe
like 38 you know where really i should
have probably had an european for
example who was very aggressive he had
an rfi on the button of 65 so we had
very different styles in terms of an
overall game plan so he used to raise 65
uh pre-flop and he used to see that 100
that was his strategy i raised 35 on the
button and i missed range t-bits all the
time because i wasn't really thinking
about it i wasn't really too worried
about it you know so we had very
different approaches
but
we had very similar opinions on how
people other people played you know so
we had opinions on what their
what their size and meant you know like
when they bet
when they instead of 50 or when they bet
120 instead of 90 or when they
uh bet the river after the flush draw
bricked on the turn for different sizes
what everything meant you know like we
were very much like our mechanics came
very much from a psychological point of
view together and we we had very strong
similar beliefs on them uh and we agreed
on and built them up but we had very
different overall game plans i would say
and i would i would say the biggest
difficulties i had in my career were
trying to change my game plan to a
different game plan so for example when
solvers came out i would post a hand
history where
i bet
i see that flop you know like i i potted
the flop on let's just say let's say the
board is 10
deuce i potted the flop and then people
would reply saying that's not a thing
and you know you've heard like poker
players say that's not a thing
and i i believed them straight away like
oh i listened to them straight away um
and i started to really doubt myself all
the success i've had you know this this
immediate like getting to number one in
the world this like really good cash
game results from like a game plan i'd
made i started to try to change it
completely and like try to play like
european or tried to play like other
guys in my stable who would run sims on
psolver but
i didn't realize at the time that of
course if they run a sim with 30 and
pot sure the solver may say only bet 30
but if they removed 30 from the sim and
had 100
probably the solver would bet pot quite
often right so it can be a thing
it may be
together with a smaller c bit size it's
not necessarily as high ev however
if i play loads of big pots and get
people into big pots on the river where
they're going to make mistakes for 10
big blinds 20 big blinds 30 big blinds
or whatever it certainly would be a
thing you know so if people um get into
really big pots against me and i make
really good position decisions it's
going to
make me a lot more money as an overall
strategy and it definitely would be a
thing compared to you know just trying
to settle for this rangeley bit on the
flop to make you know like
over uh over cards with backed up for
straws in different whatever it may be
uh i'd start to change my approach for
i'd say two to three years and i think
it really hurt my game uh trying to
listen to others or this was the
difficulties of being in a community i'd
done everything solo i used to read hand
the streets by myself i used to see how
other people played everything was solo
then i went into a community which i
built you know bitby but i went into a
community and i was like well
i i should be trying to play like you
guys you know like oh i would post the
industry and people would reply saying
oh that's not a thing or this is not a
thing or that doesn't make any sense it
did make sense in my mind but i started
to have this um
i started to have this kind of doubt you
know like am i just lucky like is this
all just being luck or whatever and i
start being like okay i need to change
my game completely i need to go to being
this like small ball kind of player uh
and i think for two years or so this
psov had just come out it really really
hurt my game and i i turned from i think
very very good to basically like not
mediocre but like like a slightly
winning player um
and i think that was
about because i was in a community um
all the people in the community i love
you know like the the guys mistaken
whatever like all great guys like all
amazing poker but
i think this just shows that sometimes
being in a community it sounds like it's
the best idea but sometimes it's not the
best idea because for me if you're in a
poker community um there's two reasons
to post a hand history right the first
reason is you post a theoretical hand so
like
the uh i raise the button big blind
calls the flop is king two four uh
should i see that twenty percent should
i see that fifty percent should i have
check backs with queens and jacks and
start that in the polarized range should
i go after a slide should i go after
bottom pairs what should i go after
right so like that's a theoretical
question i think posting that in the
community and getting like a
uh debate going is definitely not as
good as going to a solver looking okay
which hands should i bet for this size
and okay well let's run a script and see
which hands fall into bet 20 which hands
fall into bet port whatever it may be
and really going into it deeply theory
to get an understanding like that for me
is almost certainly better than being in
a community then the other side of the
question is uh an exploit sorry the
other questions you can ask are
exploitative questions so do people
bluff here or
do people fold here this kind of
question
and i started seeing people saying like
completely different things to to what i
thought and i was like starting to doubt
myself like it was a spot where i would
say no one ever bluffs here and then
everyone oh yeah everyone always bless
you and i realized from like a pretty
early
point that people play differently
versus different people right like if we
play if if me
you two and my dad play a four hundred
sit and go and my dad defends the big
blind you're gonna see bet
a different strategy against my dad than
you are against me right you're going to
bluff differently against my dad on the
river than you are against me you're
going to bluff catch differently against
my dad on the river than you are against
me right so if my game plan is a very
different game plan to all these other
people who are like betting very small
and you know like playing small ball
whereas my game plan is big parts put
people into tough situations
of course i'm going to have a different
view on how population play on the river
right so
in a community in a community it can be
quite different because not everyone
plays the same strategy so you are going
to have different points of view about
how population play uh
sabine and community you can post a
theoretical question which i think it's
better to do by yourself scripts solvers
etc
and exploitative stuff
i think it's going to be different based
on who you are you know like if if you
have a guy in a community who plays nl
uh who plays
mid stakes tournaments and a guy in a
community like european or
uh lena or ben cb or wherever he plays
high stakes people will play differently
against different profiles you know like
people play differently against phil
hellmuth and that's why he's a winning
poker player it's not because of his
technical game it's because people play
differently against him than they would
do against me and youtube you know so
for me i think being in the community
actually hurt me quite a lot not because
the guys were bad guys or anything but
because i was starting to hear and read
conflict and things about all of these
things and uh i would say for two games
it kind of messed my game up a little
bit um
so yeah
i guess it sounded like it gave a lot of
sort of noise you in the beginning had
quite a clear idea of what was going on
you were quite confident in your ability
and actually quite often i would say
that
what you do strategically obviously it
matters but the person who shows up with
most confidence in his strategy has the
ability to execute that strategy
to the best of his capabilities which in
the end like you said in the solver you
can make a solver play very strategy in
the end it's the execution of your
strategy is gonna determine how big of a
winner you're going to be not the actual
strategy itself right it's also
something that you mentioned you were
very good in playing rivers then using a
flop strategy that seabeds may be a bit
less and that allows you to get to the
river more often where you're going to
make very good decisions it's actually a
higher ev strategy right then what the
solver actually suggests obviously the
solver doesn't do that because the
solver is going to play optimal on the
river you're not going to make better
decisions than the solver on the river
but i can definitely understand that
then if solvers come out and other smart
people are talking to you
you need very big balls with very big
confidence to say okay this computer
thing is wrong i'm right right it's it's
quite hard to say like okay i'm i'm bet
i'm smarter than the solver well
yeah oh i think i i didn't do that what
i should have done is just
put my strategy into the solver and see
what does a solver say about it you know
because you know
i think the strategy which i was playing
at the time was actually solver approved
the only problem is if you run other
sizes with your size as well the solver
may slightly prefer a different sizing
which makes the whole strategy seem
wrong
so when someone runs a strategy when
someone runs a sim let's say again nine
high board i post that post me betting
200 pod i used to bet 200 parts on nine
high eight high seven high somehow some
sometimes ten high boards i used to get
really big uh
and if someone put this into a solid
then 150 and their size and which is say
30 percent the solver probably will say
yeah bet 30 with your range you know but
if they took out that bet 30 like my my
strategy wouldn't just be like a made-up
thing you know it would have been like a
it may not have been all the hands in my
range it may have went from 100
frequency to like a 60 frequency and
more of a polarized strategy but that's
what i was doing you know because i told
you i was missing c bets i wasn't
playing these small bets i was playing
big bets but when you play big bets you
play more polarized so it makes more
sense to actually not bet your whole
range it makes more sense for your
frequencies to be a bit lower so when
people say oh how did you see that here
you missed a ranged seabed
or oh my god this is lazy you missed a
ranged seabed i would hear this all the
time and that would make me feel good oh
wow i need to to find these rangeley
bets when in reality my strategy of
betting not very often but very big is
actually a strategy 10 years later which
a lot of people use and actually now is
my strategy again you know so the way
that i play now if i ever have an
opportunity to play a strategy which i
can incorporate small sizes or
incorporate big sizes i will always
incorporate the bigger sizes um i also
think there's
there's a lot of reasons about this
without going too into depth but i think
people play very well against small
sizes on the flop now they didn't used
to but they played very well now but
some the two things which
i imagine in cash games too but
definitely intolerance that people play
really poorly against is um
probes so when flop goes check check
plane is a probe bet and the second
thing is plane versus delay c bets i
worked out very quickly that the
population check raise versus delay see
bet was less than two percent so nobody
ever um would check raise the turn
after the flop went check check so
straight away if you just do like a
again i'm not really into no locking too
much because it changes things so
drastically but just from that point of
view if i go for a big polarized
strategy on the flop and then play turns
really well after the check check node
people are going to be playing really
poorly against that and that's actually
a really good strategy to play and
that's kind of how i was playing i was
minbet and turns so
i would basically see that big on the
flop and check a lot and if they check
the tone i would mind at my whole range
and it was actually a pretty good
strategy because they would probe the
turn with all their top pairs with their
drawers and
the stuff which was left in their range
on the turn was a lot of air lots of ace
highs and lots of bottom pairs so when
they just called my minbit on the turn i
was doing funky stuff i was like 10x
potent rivers 6x potton rivers maybe
value betting you know half pot go under
thin value that there's so many ways
around the tree and and i enjoyed that
you know because again i'd read all
these hand histories and now
i'd gone from reading
i'd gone from reading you know like
theories on two plus two to having a
stable of like 100 guys
who would send me full hand histories
every day you know like their full
tournament play so i started really
quickly
uh reading even more industries right i
was re people were posting on a dis we
had skype or discord i'm not sure at the
time but people would post there'd be
literally thousands and thousands of
hands posted a week i would get i would
read everyone's logic thought process
this is from like mistakes small stakes
high stakes um i would read what other
coaches thought i would see full hand
histories of players um so at this point
like i i consumed so much information of
how other people thought
that
i should have been brave enough i should
have been strong enough i should have
had enough self-will to say [ __ ] this
like trying to imitate other people and
i say this a lot but
everyone should always try to be the
best version of themselves not a bad
version of somebody else so like if you
see somebody like
if you see somebody like michael adamo
for example who's a crazy tournament guy
who bluffs a lot like it's hard to play
that strategy so if you start trying to
be michael adamo you're probably going
to be a bad version of him rather than
be a good version of yourself you know
and everyone gets to a professional
poker everyone gets to the level of
being a professional because they're
strong at something you know like i was
good at playing these big parts dog
society i was good at playing these big
parts so that's how i became a
professional poker player uh
other people became a professional poker
player because they understood math
other people became a professional poker
player because they've really understood
you know solve a like small ball
strategy other people become poker pros
because they're really good at live
tells everyone everyone gets to the
level of being better than their friends
or better than the casino game or better
than their home game or better than
whatever because they're strong at one
point no one's just like um linus love
in the first day to play poker
everyone's good at one thing usually no
one's really good at everything you're
always good at one thing and i i was
good at playing these big pots and very
bad at small pots but i should have
probably realized that but it's hard to
realize like this is all with hindsight
i've been playing poker 16 years now
whatever but my biggest advice is if you
if you break through from say university
poker if you break through from a home
game realize like why am i beating these
guys is it because i'm really aggressive
can i push people around am i really
good at free bet and free flop and
they're pushing people around that way
do i work out
i fold the rivers when everyone whenever
anyone bets like people people are good
at poker for a reason yeah but no one's
lying this love after their first two
months in poker right so really try to
emphasize what you're good at and build
your game plan around that because
you'll enjoy it more right because if
you play poker and you get good and you
keep playing and you move up the stakes
you're good at that you probably enjoy
it try to make a strategy around that
which is still solver approved whatever
but don't try to just like it's like if
you're a boxer you know tyson fury best
boxer in the world he used to probably
fight the same way he does now to how he
was when he was 18 you know he has this
like weird style like fainting gangly
like doing all this stuff if he tried to
just be like joshua in his next fight or
if he tried to be usic or whoever in his
next fight he probably wouldn't be as
good as being himself you know um
so
you know i think i think it's important
i think tyson fury basically becomes the
best version of his style which made him
go from an amateur to a professional he
didn't start trying to be like a
different kind of boxer and i think
poker's the same you know i think
probably anything is the same you know i
think messi is not trying to become a
you know like physical kind of guy who's
like winning headers and running back
and all this kind of stuff he's probably
just a better version of how he was when
he was 16. i don't think the difference
of lionel messi when he's 34 to 16 is
probably that much he's probably just
more efficient he's probably just that
little bit better that little bit more
experience you know same as same as any
any anyone i think most footballers
actually get bad once they try to stop
being a different kind of player you
know like i'm not sure i mean maybe too
much deal but harry kane basically he
was the top top striker in the world and
then
early on this season and last season he
started to drop really deep and not
really be a striker anymore he started
to play like a really deep role and he
didn't score for like so many games and
everyone was like trying to get dropped
from the england team the spurs fans
were doing them and stuff like this and
then now he's kind of said okay i'm
going to go back to
kante came in he said look you stay in
the box we're going to find you you do
what you're good at you scores our goals
and now he's going back to what he was
probably when he was 19 20 21 22 23 24
25 and now he's being the best version
of himself rather than trying to be
you know like a
trying to imitate somebody else's game
which is not why he's a professional
footballer you know
that's very good advice and this this
should not be mistaken with that you
shouldn't improve but you're saying know
what your strength is and try to expand
your game from that but don't
don't lose touch with what brought you
there in the first place right
100 and i think this is every single
poker player's
big including mine for years biggest uh
weakness and the biggest thing which
stops them from excelling you know i
really i really think though
adam sure you have a lot of questions
for for pat after that uh bomb of wisdom
that he just dropped there on the
podcast
yeah i love that yeah i like that advice
of fine-tuning yourself i think it takes
a lot of self-awareness to know like
what you're good at and to not deviate
from it like you said you were big pot
pads but even then you kind of um lost
yourself for moments because you had
lots of inputs people trying to tell you
to play different ways and i think as
you're starting out with something and
you lack a bit of confidence it's really
hard to uh put the noise to one side and
just like be the best version of you you
get dragged around by everyone in your
environments see i really like the
advice just to continue to come back to
the best version of you and fine-tuning
that and finding what that is what that
means for you yeah i think it's really
really good advice so for you and you
are coming up and when you're on your
the mdt grind and you're trying to get
to that number one ranking what was
motivating you was it the achievements
of being one of the best in the world
was there some chip on your shoulder
what was what was the initial drive to
get to where you got to the top
uh it's a good question um
i guess
it's tough question you know like i was
like 22 23 i'm not sure exactly how old
it's like first of all it's quite cool
you know to try to be the best poker in
the world you know um
i'm not saying it makes you the best
poker player in the world um but it's
quite cool to be there you know i'm
actually number one now as well on on
pocket fives in the world so like this
is ten years later so to me that's
something which i've always kind of been
uh
not necessarily striving towards
something which i'm quite proud about i
know it doesn't make you the best
pokeball in the world i know it doesn't
make mean you've made the most money in
the world i know it doesn't mean your
strategy's better than everyone else's
in the world i know not everyone opts in
i know every some people for tax reasons
may not opt in whatever it may be i'm
sure that time some people probably
when opt-in i don't know but i can't
handle that you know i can't control
that for me
i feel like it's a way of being accepted
from others in your life you know maybe
by your family but that they
that they are you know like uh
they accept your decision to be a
professional poker player you know
you've gone to university you're
supposed to be a journalist you know
it's like your son wants to be a
professional gambler all of a sudden
it's quite telling you're telling your
brothers or your sisters or your your
friends at work all my son's a poker
player now you know maybe doesn't sound
so good but if you say oh he's the
number one pokemon in the world you know
again i'm not saying i was the number
one poker in the world but he's ranked
number one in the world let's say i
think that's like
from for my parents but that kind of
thing that that that was maybe one thing
um also from like a social point of
thing you know going out meeting people
say when introducing yourself as a poker
player can be seen as bad if they are
poker players have you won anything or
like do you win oh i'm actually like
number one in the world that straights
where it gives you like a little bit
more like credit of not being a
degenerate or whatever um
so that was one thing uh it was never
about the money ever like it was never
ever about the money to make money um it
was always about the competition i loved
to play against these guys who had never
played against before so it's like
you remember i only played cash games
and now i move into tournaments i'd
never i'd never met these guys before
i'd never battled against these guys
before so it's like there was a new pool
of people i could battle against every
day uh with my strategy which was very
different to theirs they were the
tournament strategy and the cash game
strategy was completely completely
different um
stylistically the meta intolerance was
to four bet or fold a lot
uh
so
and enter three bit a lot no cold
calling whereas my strategy was i i had
like a 25 filter free bets i didn't i
never fall back left really i just used
to call three bets and just play pots uh
and
tormund plays at time with very
uncomfortable plane three bet pots and
four bit pots while three bit pots
mostly because most people didn't call
most people used to like fall better
fold like that was the meta so i played
three bet pots for like a year against
people who never played three bit pots
hardly apart from against me in european
and a few other guys because
other people would just fall back call
very wide and fall their fold the other
parts of their range maybe they would
call pocket pairs and like king queen
suited whereas i was calling you know
910 students and k9 students and ace
five students and stuff and you know
putting them into difficult situations i
was basically repping a set on every
board because they would think i always
had a pocket pair so they didn't imagine
i was gonna bluff pocket eights on like
nine five two uh so i would just turn
all of my hands into bluffs and they
weren't really prepared for it so that
was quite fun you know making a strategy
and then executing it is always very fun
so um
right now i'm actually uh
in europe basically
making a game plan for for two months i
do this every year so i go away and i
just write my whole game plan down so i
do every single board every single
position every single stack size every
single thing pre-flop and i just write
down my strategy um i make sure it's all
solved or approved i make sure that um
i'm doing things differently to how
other people do it i make sure that
people will not be necessarily prepared
for what i'm going to be doing maybe i
start incorporating like a limping
strategy from a certain position
whatever it may be um but i go away for
months at a time i don't grind i just
grind on sundays and for eight hours a
day or ten hours a day i just basically
make a strategy for two or three months
and then i come back in scoop and i play
from basically scoop till the end of the
year like seven or eight months of very
very intense volume and grinding and
yeah i re i really like the idea of
making a strategy myself and then
rolling it out for like a lot of time
and then i save
so many industries every session so i
save about 100 hand issues a session and
then when i go away for these two months
i basically have like 5 000 hands which
i go over and then it's not just hand
issues of what i'm unsure about but it's
hand mysteries of my strategy so if i
find myself
five x put on the river or if i find
myself 2x pot on the turn or i find
myself checking back the flop or if i
find myself shoving pre-flop
and maybe i think it's good not 100 sure
i will always just save it and then when
i go away to this like kind of camp
where i am now i will go over all of
this stuff from the last however much
time and i will work out is this good is
it not good um i write down everything
on like uh like even pen and paper i put
everything into documents i try to be as
organized as possible and i really enjoy
this period so this period of like
making my strategy is really fun and it
makes the execution of playing the
volume a lot more fun because i have
this strategy which i'm really excited
to roll out you know so um so yeah
that's kind of what i've done over the
last like three years i think yeah i've
done this for the last three years now
um
and it's something which i've loved
doing and
basically the the years before that
where i said i was like kind of
struggling from going what from what i
think was a really really really good
player to a very like
slightly winning player like with a
strategy i wasn't comfortable with this
that was a period of playing which
didn't make me very happy it was like
kind of a sad time of playing i didn't
get too much enjoyment out of it whereas
now the last three or four years is
completely back to like my old self
where it's like very solo work i do all
of this by myself i'm not like in a boot
camp i'm not like with other people i'm
doing it it's my strategy it's not mine
and someone else's it's all my strategy
uh no one can really
question it or like put doubts in my
mind
so this now is what i like to do um
this is where how i get enjoyment all
this yeah making a strategy executing it
rolling out that's
that's that's what i love to do now yeah
i love that and yeah it sounds like for
you you enjoy going the lab and getting
your own ideas together creating a new
strategy for the next few months and
then executing on that strategy for a
series and yeah i love that
so many years into your career you've
still got the passion to do that it'll
be very easy for you sat as currently
the number one ranked player in the
world just to play your strategy i'm
sure it's amazing but for you that's not
where the motivation is that's not where
your current drives are you want to uh
keep evolving keep learning keep
challenging yourself to come with even
better strategies so yeah really really
good so for you obviously you first got
to the number one ranking i think six
months into your mtt career now we're
like 10 years later in the future and
you're back at the top of the rankings
once again how does it feel now compared
to uh how it felt back then
um
kind of different it's um
it's a bit weird now uh i think
it's weird there's so there's so many
solvers around now right compared to
then i think then was very much like who
has the best solver um sorry who has the
best strategy will will be the best and
when before the solvers came out now
solvers really dictate a lot of a lot of
stuff so
i felt it's more of an accomplishment
then than it is now um i think now it's
more about you know hard work you know
like being organized being strict like i
would i didn't have to go away for two
or three months you know when i was 22
whatever i just played um
but i think now it's
now it's
more about hard work you know it's also
more about having a bigger bankroll so
like i can play everything with with
complete com with complete comfort when
i was like coming up
you know i didn't have as big a bankroll
like there was more doubts you know like
i wasn't as strong mentally or like i i
had so much nothing i had not didn't
have anxiety i would have like mental
game problems then right like i would be
i was young you know like new to money
whatever like i cared about what other
people thought so i had a blog i just
update my blog every day uh
and as you know with success comes a lot
of hate but i probably brought a lot of
hate on myself too because i was like
known about running bad or like
well not more about running bad i would
just like say what i thought like i was
sad about running bad even if in the
grand scheme of things i was running
good i wasn't used to like because i
came from a cash game background i
wasn't used to just losing for a week
like that just didn't really happen
right so i wasn't really prepared for
that so when i lost for a week and i had
a blog i would just tell people look i'm
unhappy like i feel unlucky i feel sad i
feel whatever um
so i wasn't really prepared for the
variance like i remember very very
strongly uh
i played well this is like a few years
down the line i played a 50k in monte
carlo and i was chipotle at this time
i was seen as i was number one in the
world online at this point
but i was seen as like a live fish
because i had no results live i bricked
my first 20 epts which is like 100k
quite a lot of money um and people at
all
people weren't saying this in my mind i
heard this in my mind oh he's he's good
online but he can't do it live like i in
my mind everyone thought that even
though nobody would have even no one
even thinks that kind of thing but in my
mind because i was blogging every
tournament i was bricking i would go to
prague brick go to berlin brick go to
malta brick go to
prague again brick go to monaco whatever
brick so i was like i want to be seen i
want the people to think i'm really good
at live poker like for some reason this
was like a big goal i want to be
accepted as a live poker player um
so i would come back from a c from a
stop and i would be like uh i'd be like
oh straight away to my blog oh my god so
unlucky this guy this guy you know i was
just saying what i thought you know and
people sometimes when you say the truth
of what you think people don't really
like it they see you as mona and they
see as entitled or whatever so most
people don't write down what they
actually think online because if if you
went onto twitter now and just did a
thread of all your beliefs all of the
controversial opinions you had you'd
probably be canceled for one of the
opinions you know you'd probably be seen
as entitled you'd probably be seen as
arrogant you'd probably be seen as
whatever so people kind of hold back
what they think but as like a 23 year
old ex-journalist who is now a poker
player i just wrote whatever i thought
so like i was like yeah i'm so unlucky
whereas people are seeing that i've got
to number one in the world through lots
and lots and lots of luck not through
really skill
some skill uh but they i i had to run so
so good to get there uh people have been
playing tournaments for like 10 years
and never get gotten there even though
they deserved it more than me
they have to read a blog of me saying
i'm unlucky it's like it's tough to read
that you know like it's very tough to
read that it's like michael adams saying
he's very unlucky because he ran bad one
month online or something you know it's
like a similar thing so
so i started to really have a weight on
my shoulders of being i wanted to be
seen as good in live poker and
i wanted just the community to think i
was a good live poker player that was
like my goal which is like a ridiculous
goal to have because it's it's one not
in my control because it's live poker
and two it doesn't even matter you know
like who cares what they think yeah so
for you it sounds like online was all
for you or for your competitive drives
and your motivation but this live thing
it sounded like you were doing that for
other people or to prove them right so
what happened when you started the ed
success live how did that make you feel
relative to what you thought it was
going to
well well this is a lot big story in
itself but uh
yeah so again going back to school i
can't listen to a teacher right for an
hour uh going back to my job i can't
just do my job i have to have poker on
the side going back to poker i have to
play lots and lots of tables so playing
live poker for me is hell like
sitting there playing so slow like i
need to be playing multiple tables i
can't just play one table so for me i
hate it at this point i'm miserable on
all the stops i think and what am i
doing with my life i need to retire i
need to do something different uh so i
go to vegas
i'm gonna guess
2016 maybe 2015
and i go for a month and i think i
probably cashed like two tournaments for
like two thousand dollars
over six weeks and i'm like
everyone's winning i'm i'm blogging
every day for six weeks lost again lost
again oh my god so unlucky i'm thinking
that everyone must think i'm a fish at
this point i've got so much like doubt
about what other people think i
basically have to leave vegas i can't
take it anymore so it's it's a week
before the main event and i just i just
can't take the losing i can't take the
failure i've never failed in my life
through look like i've just been so
lucky in life i'm like
i'm so like lucky at this point i've
just played cash game got uh had poker
as a hobby got a 50k job
played cash games at work my boss loved
it i quit
quit to play poker professionally to do
supernova elite win 300k tournaments
like i'm literally one of the luckiest
pokeballs at the time but at this point
i feel like i'm the most unlucky poker
player so i have to leave vegas i just
can't take watching other people win
having to blog that i'm losing every day
i just can't do it so i just jump on a
flight and leave but i've already bought
into the main event so i don't even
think about that but i've bought into
the main event i just leave i have to
get to london uh so i go back to london
uh i go back home i spend a week just
like going over some strategy stuff just
like play a session online i think i
have a good session online like a sunday
do well
and i have to fly back to vegas the next
day um
for some reason i've no idea why because
i haven't really been playing high
rollers there's a 25k in aria the day i
arrive i'm jet lagged i can't sleep the
main event
is the next day i think so i play the
one day 25k
um my biggest live score this point is
probably like 20k
uh i don't know maybe more uh and i win
it for like
i get i get free handed with timothy
adams and igor kurganov i think and they
don't want to deal with me which i which
i i was pretty tired about but whatever
i win i win tournament
uh i play main event day one b the next
day i bag a huge stack like two massive
stack like top 20 stack i play really i
feel great i'm running well obviously
the next day is like day one c of the
main event so i can't play so i play
another 25k area i win this for like
another 450k
i play the main event do do okay and
then there's the bellagio cup which is
like
uh the huge 10k at the end of the series
uh and i ended up winning this or
chopping this for like
i guess like 500k so i come back to
vegas and within 10 days i've won 1.5
million so i'm like wow like this is
what i've been trying to do for the last
two years i've been trying to like have
this live success and then i start
seeing like so many messages i start
getting so many messages text messages
people are replying to my vlog twitter
messages oh my god like congratulations
oh
you're a sicko what are all this kind of
stuff but i was playing the same
strategy as i was for all the other
tournaments but i wasn't getting
messages of people saying like oh i've
seen you've bricked you know like 20 bts
are you okay do you want to chat i
wasn't getting any messages of support i
wasn't getting any messages of uh
consolation i wasn't getting any
messages of uh you know sympathy i
wasn't getting people saying i want to
go coffee like i wasn't getting people
like asking for coaching you know i
wasn't getting people saying oh you're
really good i wasn't getting anything
positive and then i realized all these
messages i was receiving after i won i
wasn't really grateful for them all i
actually took them quite negatively i
was like almost [ __ ] you guys you know
like if you're not with me my bad points
i don't want you my good points kind of
thing uh so after this live success i
said i'm not playing another live
tournament [ __ ] it i'm going back online
so i think i didn't play another live
tournament i think i played one live
tournament in the next one yeah maybe
two maximum where really when you have
live success usually you play more and
more and more stops but i was like [ __ ]
this like i've achieved what i want to
achieve i've shown you guys i can win
here even though it shows nothing
winning free tournaments like it's just
luck but i was like i've shown these
guys [ __ ] this i basically stopped
blogging at the end of that year and
then i just sticked online after that um
so yeah you said how did the live live
success make me feel it made me feel
[ __ ] to be honest like the money meant
nothing i didn't really feel any
i i wasn't happy you know like it was a
relief it was a relief and it was like
i've shown these people it wasn't like
i've done this for myself i've
accomplished something
you know this should be the best one
week of my life you know at the time but
i didn't feel like that i felt i felt
sadness through it really like
i felt empty i guess the feeling i would
feel is empty i went for dinner with my
two friends who had gone to dinner with
every time i lost the tournament uh
we would go we were like the losers
dinner we would go for dinner together
uh and then when i won i stayed with the
same guys i didn't go like party with
the people who wanted to be around me
now because i'm like
running the best in vegas for a week i
was like [ __ ] these guys you know like
that's not who i want around me uh so i
completely isolate myself away from all
of these people because i was sad i
guess you know like empty
yeah it just shows how important it is
to do things for the right reasons when
you're doing things to validate yourself
in other people's eyes even though it
might feel like a big thing in the time
very often you're gonna feel hollow and
for you like that realization moment was
almost like [ __ ] everyone else like i
don't care about their opinions i'm not
doing it for these people i'm not doing
it again i'm not validating myself
through uh
success in your eyes i'm gonna do it for
me so yeah
at that moment when you hit that success
and you realize wait a second this is
kind of hello was that a kind of relief
moment in itself that you could just
drop that and go right i'm just doing
things for myself now i'm not i'm not
worried about other people's opinions
yes
so um
we had like a social media company uh
who like post in the daily first you
know because they would post like
pictures or whatever like on our social
media page and i wouldn't use free
tournaments and they made a post saying
uh
the summer saver for parts like i was
down like 30k before these tournaments
and i was expecting you know they're
going to make some big thing about me
and they called it the summer saver oh
they want to [ __ ] these guys all
about the sun to say but we fired them
the next day whatever i was like how can
they go to the summer server you know
they should be like congratulate me
whatever uh
so i was really told about that i was
told about everything i guess you know
maybe more entitlement you know like
maybe just
because everything has come so easy
because everything's just i've always
just had the success out of luck i i
guess
i guess it just i felt entitled like
this felt just normal to me you know i
didn't really feel so lucky i was like
this is just normal this is how it
should be this is how the story should
be written in the book you know so
so yeah i mean the next year or so
at the time again we're running bitby
bitby's a huge company at this point we
have
you know
over all our teams we probably have like
three four hundred guys we have you know
loads of guys working for us lots of
players like it's very active like my
life
15 hours a day is bippy you know like
waking up seeing everyone talking
everyone like it's i'm supposed to be
this high-stakes poker player but at the
time i'm spending at least 10 hours a
day with bitby stuff you know all
non-stop uh it
we it was me european elmworks it was
just us right like we didn't
we didn't bring in like external teams
or anything you know like you probably
we had one guy called ray like mondo too
like from newcastle you you'll know him
adam but we were like it was like him
and us you know he was one of our
players we didn't have
loads of guys working for us you will
remember there was just us there so
at this time i didn't really even have
time to be like a high stakes player i
didn't have time to study or whatever i
had to had to run the company you know i
had to had to do this i had a lot of
pride in this um
there's so many different poker
companies taking companies there's
probably been thousands
yeah thousands thousands of people have
staked more than one person you know and
i knew that they all went broke there's
there's probably like two stables
which have been around for ten plus
years so there's a thousand stables and
there's two left over thousand then pro
like for long term you know
or like less than 10 right there's less
than 10 stables that means you know 99.9
percent go broke or don't work out or
it's impossible let's say so
i was so determined for this not to go
wrong that i put my whole effort from
being a poker player into running the
stable because i kind of achieved the
number one online i had the live success
you know i had the money like i didn't
really need more money so the next goal
was basically to run the stable i think
like that was my that was my major thing
that was the next challenge the next
task was basically to run the stable you
know try to do things differently to how
other stables did things similar to
poker you know like have a strategy
which is different how other people had
a strategy so um yeah that's that's what
we that's why i spent the next
i think 2016 well we made the stable in
like 2013 probably but we were like big
in like 2016 to 18 like massive i would
say so i spent all my time then doing
doing that mostly
this podcast is brought to you by poker
ambition where me and adam have created
our coaching program the mechanics of
poker after having reached high sex
poker ourselves we tested out this
philosophy on our cfp students which saw
them rise through the ranks and doubled
their win rate we then took the best
knowledge of that cfp program and turn
it into the mechanics of poker so you
can have that high quality content
without the long-term commitment and
often hefty price that comes with a cfp
program now i will be teaching you the
technical side of how poker really works
how to think about the game and how to
consistently get better and adam focuses
on the mindset and performance skills
you need to know in order to convert all
that technical poker knowledge into more
consistent profits at the table now this
program is high level it's made for
professional poker players who have the
ambition to break free from mid stakes
and move up to high stakes poker so if
you're ambitious about your poker goals
go over to
pokerambition.com for more information
and there you can also find a free one
hour demo of everything that is inside
the program if you have any further
questions don't hesitate to reach out
but without further ado let's get back
to more goodness in this episode
yeah yeah ready i'm sure you can relate
to running the stable and that taking
time away from your
grinding hours and maybe putting some
your own goals on hold whilst you uh
have other people pursue their goals
yeah but with me it was with uh i think
at the max 19 players and for me that
was
i mean that was my new full-time job but
then again i was i was also
basically the only coach so i was
coaching 19 guys
and
yeah i mean
it also i guess it also depends a little
bit on your personality reflecting on it
that was way too perfectionistic in
terms of my coaching hours i could have
done it probably in half the hours but
that's not really how i am but at some
point i was like it was getting in the
way
of
me being able to play poker and the
thought i remember for me personally the
thought of we were busy expanding it
right because that's what you do you get
players in and then you start to expand
but remember the thought of expanding
with even more players i was like oh ho
no we're not going to do that because i
would just basically my life would be
yeah rude by my students right and what
i really like about why i started this
is because i like poker strategy but at
some point you can probably relate to
this patch you become more of a
yeah you're a poker player manager
basically there's nothing to do anymore
with
being
a coach in poker strategy because you're
trying to manage people's careers you
know there's always problems you know
every week you have to deal with a
student who's not doing so well uh and
at some point for me personally i i
transitioned away from that now we're no
longer doing the cfp so also to create
space for myself um i know that at this
moment i don't think you're doing bit b
anymore what was the reason that you
guys decided or that you maybe decide to
to stop doing that
uh
so we're our peak at this point so our
biggest um
and then i make some decisions i don't
play on certain sites um
i stop playing on certain sites i'm not
going to say the slides whatever cause
drama but i stopped playing on certain
sides from like a moral point of view i
didn't think
the sites were doing the right thing at
the time
for the overall ecosystem i thought it
was going to cause massive dramas
massive scandal towards the industry and
i didn't want to put my rake towards
that um
so for me i stopped playing on
one one of the biggest sites out there
uh
and now i had a moral
thing internally was i was giving
hundreds of people money
to play on the site like with my my
money essentially to create the rake
that's like a whole player pool almost
right um however the players i'm giving
the money to were not in a luxury
position that i was to be able to just
quit and take away like 50 of their
expected income because they have
mortgages to pay wives wives you know
their bankrolls are all very small not
very small but you know they don't have
security for like the next years or
whatever so
for me i had to tell the i just i'd
either put my foot down and say look i
don't want you guys playing here either
uh
which these people are now like family
best friends like i went and holiday
with them three times a year we used to
do boot camps all the time before scoop
before two coop i spent 10 hours a day
on discord speaking to every single one
of them i i was very very personally
invested in them so
number one i couldn't really
tell them i don't want you to play here
and take away 50 of your money because
what they're going to tell their wife oh
we have a 50 packet this month
two i had two partners right european
and elmericks i didn't want to impose my
moral view on them and make them feel
guilty because they were still playing
on the sites and stuff and they didn't
have a problem with them which is
completely fine you know uh
some of my best friends have different
different political views to me doesn't
mean we're not friends anymore so it
doesn't mean they have wrong views which
have a different view to me so
i didn't want to force my opinion on
them and make them
put this on to the players
so
i had two options i could either try to
encourage everyone to stop playing or i
remove myself
and
stay in the community stay coaching stay
blogging stay active but get no put no
finance in and take no finance out so
it's quite a big decision because it's
like a revenue stream of you know
decent six figures to basically to zero
which is like a relatively big thing
uh
but
at the time it just felt like the right
thing for me to do because
you know let's say
let's say there's a uh
that's it is a crypto coin and if you
invest in the cryptocurrent it's going
to make money for the next one yeah it's
going to go you know it's going to go up
really good but you know the money that
this coin is going to get is going to
like
cause some fraud or call some maybe
they're building bombs or maybe whatever
it may be
i wouldn't invest in the coin you know
just because i'm going to turn my 100k
into 120k because they my 20k is gonna
cont my my money which they use
initially to bankroll or whatever is
going to initially bankroll rockets or
missiles or drugs or whatever it may be
so i saw the same as that i didn't
believe
morally in
in some of the sites or whatever so i
didn't want to give my money towards
them and by staking hundreds of players
whatever on the sites i'm putting lots
and lots and lots and lots of money in
there you know so i said i'd rather
admit i'm not playing white knight or
anything here but i would basically make
less money myself still have the
enjoyment of being in the community
still the enjoyment of helping people
out still have the enjoyment of being
friends with people
but just not contributing to it from
that point of view because
it makes me easier to sleep at night uh
so yeah that was basically a decision
it's obviously
we had the company for like eight years
probably at this point um
it was my life you know uh i'd sacrifice
playing poker to basically
like i played maybe just sundays maybe a
tuesday you know series
to run bp every day like that was my
life um
i went i was like unhealthily like i
wasn't like eating well looking after my
mind well like my whole focus was on be
anyone who's been a bit people know like
i was by far the most active guy even
more than any of the players any of the
coaches any anyone like i was so so so
active it was my life so it was a big
big decision um
i didn't take it lightly um but
i i had to do it at the time i think uh
and also i'm a party poker ambassador so
let's just say that i
fell out of pod let's say i find that
party poker like i hope this is not uh
cut in a bad way but let's say i find
that party poker have uh
bots at high stakes who are planted uh
let's just say say that's the case uh
and let's say i i want to leave party
poker
then what happens in the future do i
tell all the players they have to leave
poly pokey too you know like it's a and
i have the same the same question
happening and i've realized that
in the future i'm gonna have these same
questions about all sites and i'm gonna
have these on moral issues and all stuff
that
if i didn't leave then when i left i
would have to leave sometime in the
future because the same problem would
come up um
so i mean people may disagree and may
think that you know
people would play anyway even if it's my
money or not but i don't think that's a
way to to do things i mean in the end
it's what's most important for you right
you mentioned what makes you sleep well
that's the best decision uh you
mentioned something about uh when you
were doing bit b
uh that you were trying to do things
different than from your competitors
right you mentioned there are thousands
of people who at least take you know
more than one one player what were some
of the things that you think would be b
got you guys ahead of the curve compared
to your competitors well first of all uh
time so
you know
if um
let's say let's say you get offered a
job as an intern right in a company like
a wall street company you often work for
for no hourly like you work because you
work now because you don't get a good
hourly but in the future your hourly is
going to be high because you've done
this internship you know um so we did a
lot of coaching initially which was a
lot of hours and our hours were very
expensive or would be very expensive to
other stables because we were like three
of the top 10 online players at the time
right so like let's just say my dad made
a stable and he wanted to hire the three
of us to be
the lead coaches for the stable the
stable would never be profitable because
he'd be paying us more money than the
players would be making but we made this
devotion of time initially as high
stakes players to get people to a level
or to get a reputation like we had a
good brand like bitby was a good brand
because we were the coaches but for the
first you know six months one year
whatever our hourly was probably you
know less than a dollar because so much
time meetings we make mistakes whatever
so the first thing is i think a stable
it's very different stable to be
successful because if you run the stable
like let's just say a random guy who
doesn't play poker isn't high-stakes
player how can he critique what levels
the players should be playing at because
especially in tournaments where there's
so much variance how can he say this
guy's a 109 player this guy's a 55
player this is a guy's a 22 player so
the first thing we did was devote our
time to it knowing our owl is really bad
now we'll probably be better in the
future and i think most labels will fail
because the people making the decisions
of the game selection and whatever is
actually they just don't know right
they're not qualified to know so that
was the first thing the second thing is
we became very stat orientated so
again 2015 1614
uh
there wasn't really too much emphasis on
solvers and huds and stuff like this
people just kind of played give people
money and played we had basically every
single stat in possible in pt4 and we
made rankin systems for them so like we
had green red yellow yellow meant it's
okay green means really well performing
and red means really low so just for an
example
fold the font well let's say rfi in the
button
let's see our strategy we wanted them to
play was 60 rfi and a button that would
be green plus
uh yellow would be 50 to 60 so i'd be
like acceptable and then anything under
50 would be seen as unsuccessful uh like
unsatisfactory and everyone's goal in
the stable was to get all of their stats
green and we would give them their stats
updated every week or month with like a
review of okay this is what you need to
improve for the next month so we tried
to get the whole stable to basically
play the same strategy of getting the
stats in the same way um
so that was like a main thing we did and
then we had tears so we had tiers from
10 to one so tier one was the highest
stake players tier 10 was the lowest
stick players and if you started in tier
10 you had a very clear path of how you
moved upstairs it wasn't on profit it
was on one volume you needed to put
volume in
and two you needed your stats to be at a
certain level and if you had good stats
we believed in you we moved people up
who were losers like from tier 10 to
tier 7 but we also moved players down
who were winning at tier 1 to tier 4
because we thought their strategy is not
sustainable and we know there's going to
be a downswing happening whereas this
guy who's winning say 200k in tier one
there's no other stable in the world who
would drop him or maybe just quit him
from the stake because we don't believe
in him you know we don't believe we have
our method we believe in our method and
we believe in the data and it doesn't
matter if you win 500k a million
whatever we will drop you if we don't
believe in it or we don't see you doing
what we want you to do whereas
the other stables probably
didn't drop people at those levels you
know uh and it's a tough conversation
because these people are your friends
and by luck we just don't we don't
believe in you you know it's tough to
tell someone that you've taken on
holiday that's made you hundreds of
thousands of dollars to just look them
in the eye and say look i don't believe
in you i don't think you can do this but
we made lots of very very difficult
decisions uh very very difficult
decisions and there's players who didn't
accept them and took them personally and
that's fine i get it um
but we thought we were doing them the
best thing because if they started to
lose and they were in big makeup then
what happens you know like they're gonna
it's gonna destroy their life you know
so we were doing it for them but they
thought we were doing it they thought we
were doing something personal whatever
it meant we would meet people three
times a year and that would be seen as a
cost to most stables oh can we really
take 60 people away on holiday can we
take 20 people away on holiday it's
expensive to go to barcelona with 30
people right but we would meet people
and even if they were a good poker
player or even if they'd been winning
even if they had good stats if we had a
bad impression on them we would just
drop them which sounds quite brutal it
sounds quite brutal
but we just didn't
we we're very much people people people
persons person people i'm not sure how
you say it uh we were very much people
people people and uh if we had a bad
instinct we would just we would cut
people uh and we would tell them
truthfully you know like we don't think
this is the best place for you and we
never did anything against people it was
always in their best interests if we
didn't think it was gonna work out it's
not good for them you know uh and over
time we probably had
six six hundred players maybe more i'm
not sure
maybe over a thousand i'm not sure but
after a month like we would take people
in quite a lot and just just drop them
after a month okay he's lost 10k it's
fine this guy's not going to be our guy
because they have to interact well in
the community they have to
do their homework whatever it may be if
there's any red flags then we just got
rid of people you know it's fine
um
we had lots of good coaches we overpaid
for coaches again like our coaching team
was uh
michael adamo uh stefan sondheimer fidel
holtz uh graph tackle uh sick one like
we had the best pl the best players in
the world you know we invested in the
best mental game coaches we had adam we
had elliot we had james you know we had
everyone like we wouldn't just get one
guy we knew that one mental game coach
may be good for one person but what if
someone else needs somebody else so we
understood people's personalities this
guy will do really well with him because
they're quite similar so we
we hide as many people as possible um
we just did ever we tried to just to do
as much as possible really think of
every angle you know every single angle
um there's probably more i just that i'm
not thinking about yeah uh yeah we used
to also be risky so i would stream all
my sessions to like people who've been
unstable for like a month or two months
you could just be restreaming my session
to other people you know like
we put a lot of trust in people you know
like um
yeah
did you you did coaching yourself as
well right for players
or were you more on the business side of
things uh no me european and elmericks
would coach the most so we would i think
every coach would coach once a month so
like
uh like grafteco would coach once a
month like sick one would coach once a
month i maybe there's this guy a dutch
guy uh
high stakes cash game guy
not pims pims's brother poker cougar
club yeah pogba cooker nameless guy
like we would identify people like this
who played very different and we would
invite them in to try to be a coach like
kluka came in and did a couple of
sessions on he was playing high stakes
sit and goes at the time yeah yeah i
remember we i think it's been like 5k
sit and goes so we got him to come in
and do like 20 big blinds button versus
small blind because we weren't experts
so we would do a lot of like overall
hand histories so we would kind of
try to ingrain our overall identity into
the players and then we'd get specific
coaches versus
specific stuff so maybe we'd say to
graphe okay for this month we want you
to do out of position c ben so he would
go away for a month make a really
detailed presentation all this kind of
stuff we'd have romeo pro he was the
best coach in the world probably at the
time he would do a lot of stuff on cbet
and versus the big blind you know we'd
have uh michael adamo who would be doing
bluffs field halts who would be doing
you know maybe like live poker stuff
whatever it may be stefan heimer who
would
explain the whole like idea of when to
bet big went to that small from a theory
point of view because we knew he was
really good at that so we would do lots
and lots of ha overall hand histories
and we would maybe be we would maybe
been seen as not as good coaches as the
other guys but it was done and it was
done in this uh systematic way
on purpose so we would give an overall
strategy between me sam and tommy so we
would repeat the same buzz words repeat
the same strategies this is
repeat the same concepts over and over
and then we'd have all of these
individual coaches going in on like
individual topics which they were very
very much uh
experts in so adam would come in and do
like something on what he was an expert
in you know james would come and do what
he was an expert in we'd have them doing
the different kind of seminars you know
so uh there was a lot of content and a
lot of different content i think uh i
personally had to stop going to watch
these sessions which is crazy like i had
so much available resources of getting
better but i knew this was at the period
of time where i changed my strategy from
what i wanted to do to what other people
wanted to play so it was very dangerous
for me to go into a coaching session
with say uh graphtecal or go into a
coaching session with somebody else who
played a completely different style to
me because what i find myself doing is
i would watch graphi's session it would
motivate me so much oh wow this is
amazing he's taught me this trick he's
told me that trick i'd go into a session
and try to become
graph deco rather than pads and i would
be a very very bad version of graphical
rather than trying to be the best a
better version of myself so maybe
graffiti wants to
there was this thing in bitby we used to
um
[Music]
if you were ever out of position to the
player
uh to your direct left we would check
range because his range is like slightly
stronger than your range uh where it's
like if i raise under the gun and you
flap the button my range is like
considerably stronger than your range on
the button because you have lots of
weakish hands but if i raise mp and u
flat
one position along like mp1 or mp2
you basically don't have the weekends
like king 10 off suit and queen nine
suited and stuff you're very much
condensed around like a slightly
stronger range than mine even though you
don't have the net advantage you have a
stronger range really so we used to play
in big b for example they would be okay
we're going to play range checks because
graphing would do a session i'm not
saying it's graphic someone would do a
session or maybe stephen sondheim would
do a session on okay we're going to
range check here because it makes sense
from a theoretical point of view but i
was doing stuff like just
potting the flop and people were under
defending and i was doing some cool
little tricks myself whatever maybe
betting really small on the flop because
people used to raise in position with
top player versus small bets and then i
would over bet the turn after i would
just have my own plan right but after i
watched the session from these guys i
would start range checking i'll just
find myself oh like i would hear
buzzwords range check or like this or
that it was really really hard in my
game even though it was amazing
theoretical knowledge even though this
was the way to play like against
computers or against an overall
population if you want to make a solid
strategy for me that wasn't that wasn't
right for me you know i i quickly became
worse a worse player than these coaches
like
i think when graffy and these guys came
in i was a really high level and then i
think when they came in they all became
better than me uh i have never really
said this stuff publicly i don't really
care but i i started to become like a
bad
they became better poker players than me
because i was a bad version of gruffy
you know i didn't understand the whole
strategy as well as he did because he'd
spent a month
working out the strategy i'd listen to a
one hour
and listen to a one-hour coaching
session so i become a bad version of
graphic without position c betton i came
a bad version of romeo pro with cbet and
versus the big blind i became a bad
version of whatever theodore halts
taught i became a bad version of stephen
sondheim's strategy and something else
so i just became a bad version of all
these coaches
which is really really detrimental to my
play you know and i struggled i
struggled for some time because of this
so i had to stop going to the coaching
sessions i i realized what was going on
and i had to stop going to these
sessions and just uh yeah because it was
in reality the voice thing which could
have happened to me was to get these
seven amazing best poker players in the
world to improve my game you know
so nowadays are there still i'm sure
there's a couple things that stick with
you right what you
like obviously trying to copy them as
you explained you should stay true to
your own strengths nowadays if you look
at your strategy your play from pat's
pickpot paths strategy you know your
main strength but i'm sure there's a
couple of things right that you now
still using your strategy that you
taught from these other players but you
gave it the right place
or is it completely
completely pat
no
no no completely these guys these these
guys are completely why i understand
poker for sure like they they would they
would say a theoretical concept and i
and i would i would
like stuff
they would give me so many ideas to
explore you know like they would say
something
then and that would completely still
stick with me now you know like 100
like that like stuff yeah i can't think
of exact examples but
like
they have such a huge influence on my
career for sure like they just helped me
they pushed me in directions to explore
and to make my strategy for sure and
also like they taught me how everyone
else is thinking too you know it's like
i know that this is how everyone else is
thinking okay well this is how they're
this is what they're used to this is
what they're used to facing this is what
their game plan is what can i do as a
game plan which they're not used to like
what can i do as a game plan which might
make them like i know they're amazing in
their strategy why would i want to play
their strategy against them you know
like if they
if they wanted like half pot seabed uh
in three bed parts
for example and they they know exactly
how it works like why would i do this
when they know their strategy better
than me why not try to make something of
myself which is got a similar ev anyway
in terms of theory if i put my strategy
into a solver and they're stretching
into a solver like the evs are going to
be so similar anyway however
they're going to play their strategy a
lot better than i can play their
strategy but my strategy they don't ever
play because it's not worth them
studying this strategy because no one
else plays it you know and i'm not
saying like completely ridiculous things
here i'm just talking about small tweaks
so like
you know like i said playing a more
polarized strategy is what
like if i if i was recommending someone
out there now like atonement player i
would say try to change your strategy to
a stylistic approach which supports
bigger more polarized bets because one
people are very poor against playing
them on the flop but two the node of
check check flop people played the turn
really poorly against and also people
play the the the note of you know bet 25
percent of bet 37 before people play
really well against that because there's
so many courses there's so many
uh seminars there's so many discord
groups where people are going over these
kind of things you know everyone's
pretty good at that now in 2017 when
solvers came out everyone was terrible
against ranged c vets no one no one knew
what to do everyone was overfold and
nobody was check raising like
the average check raised in big d was i
think like four percent and we wanted it
to be like 15 or something like people
were not check raised and now people
know about you know check raising bottom
pair for some protection when you
unblock the over cards all that kind of
stuff like no one knew any no one knew
anything like this you know like
there was no none that kind of stuff but
now everyone mostly knows
so you're uh it sounds like you're a big
advocate of of using strategies that the
rest of the population isn't using which
you know as you you know it's still sort
of gto approved
but then you're putting people in a
situation that they're not familiar with
but you are the person who is familiar
with that spot so you will make better
decisions and in the end better
decisions lead to more ev
for sure for sure and i think
i i think you want to emphasize i'm not
talking about completely crazy things
here like i'm talking about things which
are just like
deviations but i'm not saying let's
start playing you know chess instead of
poker i mean like
just small small deviations and also i
think one of the strongest ways to get
this is actually playing against players
who put you into situations which you
don't know what to do and this can often
be like a fish so like a fish could do
something against you maybe he like min
bets the turn for example after flops
check check and you're like [ __ ] what do
i do here and then you realize wow this
fish has actually made me
my eyes open to a part of the game tree
which i didn't realize before you know
so i think always been very observant
and players who put you into tough spots
try to say well why does he put me into
a tough spot so you'll know this guy
tian de milde uh dutch guy yeah we
actually coach him in our cfp in the
beginning okay okay great well i i know
him quite well very talented player like
when i say i coach him i mean
it was it was a guaranteed success yeah
well he came to mtt's not that long ago
like uh
to high stakes at least he showed up and
he had like a really good like i think
six months one year i'm not sure like
something at some
i don't know exactly the time for him
when he showed up whatever but he showed
up and he was doing really well because
and the stuff which he was doing really
well i was struggling against whether it
be
he was doing lots of triple barreling he
was doing lots of like over betting the
turn
uh just just different stuff right he
was doing stuff really good and i was
like well i'm really struggling against
this so if i'm really struggling against
this probably everyone else not everyone
else but probably other people are
struggling against this too so why do i
not uh i don't imitate his strategy but
why do i not if this strategy is really
i'm tough against maybe this is a better
strategy to use but then you know the
really tight regular just that's really
small on the flop against me checks to
turn and that's you know two thirds on
the river you know like i never feel
threatened i never feel like i'm
sweating in these kind of pots but when
i'm against tien de moda i was making
bad calls on the river because his
overall strategy was put me into an
uncomfortable position where on the
river i was guessing i was letting my
emotions take control because i didn't
know the theoretical response because
when you know the theoretical response
you don't really play emotionally right
because you know okay yeah he bets this
i call this i check where is this part
of my range it's like it's okay when
someone starts putting you into an
uncomfortable situation you're like you
often act out of emotion rather than
logic i think and tienda mulder
definitely i think michael adamo is the
same he does things which people really
really struggle against and
i think yeah so team de mulder i think
is a i wouldn't say a big influence on
how i play but like i definitely think
i i saw something from him that was like
okay this guy's saying [ __ ] it i'm not
gonna play how everyone else plays in
the pool i'm gonna play differently and
i think that gave me a lot of confidence
okay i'm gonna maybe i i should maybe go
back that to my roots that way too you
know um
so yeah shout out to team the mulder i
really i really like him as a ziploc i'm
sure he's a good guy too i should never
met before
like i said
pure pure talent
i would say i remember when he when he
came in
also i would say everything that i
remember everything that i explained to
him you have some students that
are always looking for
what might be wrong or what could go
wrong but i remember with tino you would
say something he would say okay that
worked bomb relentlessly execute he had
no problem especially you know towards
towards the aggressive side he was he
definitely liked to put people to the
test
um
what in your opinion like you you have a
lot of coaching experience
what in your opinion
makes
a student still feel for example
everyone at bb got the same type of
coaching right they got the same content
but still some players did make it and
other players didn't what do you think
are some of the reasons why some of your
students at bb didn't make it and other
people did rise through the ranks
so
i would say
one aggression
the aggressive players always do better
like aggression just works in poker at
every level every game like gto in
itself is very aggressive it's lots of
check raise and lots of steep and lots
of over betting
not like not being not being afraid to
bust tournaments like you have to pull
the trigger you have to put people into
those situations most people are
uncomfortable against aggression even
aggressive players
are uncomfortable face and aggression
it's like if you're the most aggressive
player in the world but you face a free
ex pot river show if you're like [ __ ]
like this is this is uncomfortable you
know so like you need to be aggressive
and only aggression will ever succeed
there's no there's no really successful
poker players in the world who are not
aggressive so you need to be naturally
aggressive you need to want to bluff you
need to want to
you need to want to
to put people into tough situations you
need to want to find those nodes
so that's the first thing aggression is
just so key if a guy is scared to pull
bluffs uh if a guy is scared to use big
size and they just will not succeed i'm
pretty sure of that so that's that's
number one uh number two is not being
afraid to look stupid in front of other
people uh a lot of people don't post
hand histories of their big bluffs or
their big aggression uh they they may
play like 100 hands in this they may
mark 50 hands in a session and then
they'll go through their hands and like
oh like i don't really want to post this
one because it could be terrible or like
maybe i lose like maybe this bet on the
river loses 20 big blinds or maybe this
call on the river loses whatever but
being bold enough and brave enough to
not get really give a [ __ ] about what
other people
think about you is a huge thing um
i think those are the two main things
about people coming through uh
i think free is like being
maybe being a well three is the main
thing is about volume i i i strongly
strongly think the biggest skill you can
ever have in poker is volume and i've
realized this very very very early um
you know you can be the best poker
player in the stable but if you play
four tables uh then it doesn't really
matter right because you're not making
as much
if you have a 25 or if you have a 20 roi
and you play four tables but i have a 10
roi so you are like technically twice as
good a player as me but i play 12 tables
i'm a better poker player than you are
just like it's fact right like poker
player the
how we how we
uh rank poker is like who makes the most
money right it's not like who you know
like jokes off over the sim getting it
right the best or it's not who
you know would get a test right we used
to do tests in bitby so we used to do
tests where we do 30 questions and you
have to like do a whole thing and we
used to mock people like the best poker
player in bitby wasn't the guy who got
30 out of 30. the best poker player is
the guy who makes the most money right
so like the most
you have two things two metrics of money
in poker is one roi or win rate and cash
and two is volume so you need to combine
them both if you can only play good
poker one day a week doesn't matter the
guy who plays six days a week or
whatever he's going to be he is a better
poker player than you it doesn't matter
if you if you get a better score on dto
it doesn't matter if you get less ev
errors when you run odin or whatever the
software it doesn't matter right so very
very important is that you understand
and not just that you understand that
volume is important but you actively try
to work on it so like i've been playing
poker
17 years now i can play 25 tables like
pretty comfortably like but i can't i
didn't just one day play 25 tables you
know like i used to play one table and
then i realized okay i need to pick two
tables then four then six then eight and
then twelve and then whatever and uh
and then you add it up and you add it up
and you add it up and then things start
to become easier as you train it you
know you don't just go to the gym one
day and just start like lifting the
heaviest weight or you don't just go to
the gym and do like 60 reps the first
day you know you probably go to the gym
the first time on january the 1st after
you haven't gone to the gym for 11
months or whatever and you start uh you
start doing six reps you know of a low
weight and then next day you go to the
gym maybe you do like
eight reps uh and then maybe the next
day you do like 12 and then you build it
up right and then by
november you've grinded it up and now
uh like adam will say to be successful
in the gym you need to have you know
consistency you need to have good reps
you need to be able to lift good weight
whatever you can't do that on january
the first try you need to build it up so
for volume
identifying okay i need to play good
volume let's just load loads of tables
up let's copy pads this is not going to
work you need to see it as
as you need to see volume as a skill you
need to train volume the same way that
you train c-bet against the big blind
but to me the way that most people
failed in bb and other stables is they
spend 95 of the time focusing on the
strategy side which is
making small amounts of difference of ev
maybe changing their roi from 10 to 10.1
percent when really to get that extra
1.1 percent all you have to do is add
another you add another table and you've
got an extra 2.5 percent you know like
why most people don't see it that way
but
to win to win in poker you need to win
money and it doesn't matter if it comes
from a strategy or volume whatever it
may be you need
this it all works out the same way you
know yeah
i i completely understand with me
obviously
the adding the tables
like your
the the game that you can bring to the
table if you add tables should still be
sufficient that it doesn't drop your roi
per that table right it's like a sweet
spot that you have to find but indeed i
understand what you mean you have to
it's a skill to try to
improve playing more tables that's what
you're saying right for sure and i never
really see being spoke about too much
like oh like what did you work on this
month how do you start if you ask
someone in bigby what did you work on
this month but oh i worked on opposition
c button which they probably worked on
the other months as well uh i worked on
free bet parts i worked on my preflop
ranges okay cool but what you didn't
work on like trying to pay more tables
like surely you know if you play six
tables now and then your goal is in 12
months to play 12 tables that's double
your win rate is working on our
opposition c bet and gonna double your
roi i don't think so you know like i'm
pretty sure that if you only have to
focus on one thing it's definitely
better to focus on the volume rather
than the strategy like even if your
strategy deteriorates from say
a 10 winner to a 7.5 winner so you lose
25 of your win rate because you get lazy
sloppy whatever but you double your
volume like you're a better poker player
than you were 12 months ago even if
some of the guys ran 5000 dto sims or
whatever
watched 100 training videos doesn't
matter like
whoever makes the most money at the end
of the year whoever's the best graph is
the better poker player like that's just
how it is yeah i guess it also depends
on where you are in your in your poke
career like say for example in the
beginning spend a bit more time on
improving your strategy and once your
strategy is solid okay now to
increase your winnings you should try to
add more tables uh yeah but then again i
think at the early parts of your career
uh the most important thing is to play
reps to start seeing how other people
think i think you need to see like the
reason why
i think you need to like get into
situations see what population are doing
in as many spots as possible you know
like if anything at the early part of
your career
being a being an observant loser is more
important than being a studied winner i
think at the start of your career like
understanding what other people do is so
crucial to especially in tournaments
especially in terms and cash games i
understand
especially in high stakes cash games and
mistakes costumes etc but in low stakes
and midstage tolerance it's all about
being observant seeing what other people
do seeing you know we're seeing when
people show down certain lines seeing
when people use certain sizes being
observant like really focusing on those
kind of things i think
is important and to do that you need to
put in volume right you need to place
you need to play and play and play and
then go over the industries and then
maybe you have more when you go through
your database you have twice as many
river spots right so it's quite tough to
get sample sizes and it's very difficult
if you look at some sample sizes in uh
on huds like maybe 10 czech rosen for
example like if you go through if you
played a hundred thousand hands and you
go through how many times someone's
check raise the turn
it might it may happen less than 20
times like really like it
like in in the note of check check flop
check turn it just doesn't happen
because you people see that the flop so
much and then people just probe the turn
so much and people just don't check rays
whatever it's like you just don't get
that sample you know so you need to you
need to really really play a lot to be
observant a lot and to start thinking
about different strategies and to think
okay well what's my game plan going to
be right like i need to build a game
plan like i can study sure i can just go
and open up ps over and just study but
like where do i start from what what
sizes do i put into the solver where is
my ideas coming from where's my
creativity coming from you know you need
to
you need to have a base you need to have
this like observant thing where you're
like writing down things you know i
really like saving hand histories where
you see something from somebody so like
someone does something and then you get
an idea you know you get this idea and
you're like wow this may be a thing but
i'm not sure it's a thing so i save it
then like i'll send it to european or
whoever afterwards i'm like what do you
think about this then get some feedback
on it and then now you suddenly have a
thing right see the thing you put in the
solver is the thing a thing you know
like does it make some sense like
how does it look like based on this how
does it look like based on that but to
have a thing you need to see the thing
first you need to be observant if you
just i think a lot of people just start
and they focus so much on strategy and
not on volume
and
i think 95 of where i play what i play
comes from just
previous playing and saving the
industries and like making a strategy
based on like maybe i see somebody else
do something you know maybe you see like
a russian guy uh lead the flop for
example from the big blind uh so he
leads like um right now in mtt's the
small blind in a multi-way part leads a
lot so like let's say cutoff opens small
blind calls big blind calls the small
blind theoretically leads a lot because
he knocks out the big blind so let's say
it's like a queen-eye board the small
blind may lead to very small to just
knock out the big blinds like 80 of his
range so that you work together like
soft colluding but like you have to
study a lot to see that right but if you
see someone yourself do that like let's
say you see a russian guy do that oh
that's an idea like why is he doing that
save the industry now you have a thing
ask the european oh i see this russian
guy doing this it's good like or maybe
you even send him or this guy has no
clue what he's doing and then maybe
europeans like oh actually it makes some
sense and you put it in the solver and
it makes some sense right but if i just
started not playing poker the volume and
i just opened up uh some solver i need
to actually put in to allow the small
blind to have leads i need to put in all
the different stuff and uh yeah actually
playing is just so undirected like
so so undirected and uh
yeah yeah and then mainly playing
with the
curious mind to try to see
how can i get better as well right from
other players spots that other players
put me in i think it's important
it's still sort of quality volume you're
playing to learn to get better at the
game
yeah
yeah uh 100 i mean if you ask me
tomorrow uh i've got one hour just i've
got three hours to study uh next next
week because i'm at university how can i
spend these three hours to get better at
poker uh
what would you what what what would you
say you have a torment player he says i
only have three hours next week i want
to get bet i want to get better he's
like a midstix play he's a winner uni
has three hours to dedicate to poker
next week what would you what would you
what would you tell him to spend these
these three hours on
i would probably say
go if he has three hours
i don't look at footage of
someone who's very good playing
basically i have a very similar what i
would do is i would say okay there's a
10k on gg next week on sunday what
you're going to do is you're going to
open up every table on your other screen
you're going to open up camtasia and
you're going to record all 10 tables
which are running in gg's 10k and you're
going to record one hour of this footage
so you're going to record one hour of
this footage when you have your three
hours you're going to open up the
footage and what you're going to do is
you're not going to try to make your own
strategy because these guys are better
than you you don't have the time to make
your own strategy you're going to watch
all of these tables whenever anyone does
something which you wouldn't have done
yourself you're going to say is it is
why is he doing this because these
players are better than you because
they're playing high stakes there
they've studied for years whatever see
what they do see what they try to not
necessarily like imitate or replicate
but maybe you get some ideas and then
maybe you can build on from there you
know um
but
maybe i'm wrong but i don't think
probably i mean i have a guy who does it
for me but i don't think probably
i i think nobody really records like
they watch final tables right they watch
final table reviews on youtube like
that's the thing everyone does but like
sure it's completely different to an
overall strategy because the final table
is so unique there's so much icm there's
like so many different mixed stack sizes
going on or whatever to me it's so much
more valuable to watch the 12 tables of
just chippy v stuff watch three bet pots
you can even say i want to work on three
bit pots next week so i know what i'm
doing okay well do you start from
scratch with three bit pots or do you
just go through this footage and just
only watch three bit pots see what
people do in freebit bots you know see
what sizes they use see why you know
like you see showdowns even if you don't
see showdowns it doesn't matter you're
seeing what sizes they use
okay this guy bets 25s on a sideboards
okay well maybe there's a thing michael
well it's not michael damn it's like a
thing which is like a common concept of
uh say you raise i free bet you call and
the board's ace high in there's some
size and schemes where you where out of
position you may bet like 20 flop 20
turn 20 river because you have like kind
of kings and queens which you want to
value against their sevens and eights
and nines and uh you want to value that
your a's your asex but you have a lot
more like you may have a lot of like ace
deuce to ace five which you want to put
a little bit money in but you don't
really want to put in like three big
streets of value
but probably someone studying pogo for
the first time or not for the first time
but like just trying to get ideas
they're probably not going to think
themselves of a size and scheme of you
know like that's about 20 flock 20 turn
20 river something like this you know
but if you watch michael adamo do it no
i have an idea here this is quite cool
this is a concept and now it starts
making you think about equity it starts
to make you think about range versus
range it starts opening different doors
different directions it starts making
you think of poker in a certain way
whereas when you have a blank sheet it's
very difficult to come from from there
you know um
so yeah there's just there's that that's
why that's that's why i recommend with
people who wouldn't have enough time
what i think people do is they open up
youtube they watch an hour final table
and they start getting bad ideas
actually because they start getting
ideas of oh well this is the sizing we
should use in these pots and in
in in icm you never bet big you always
bet small because the if you bet small
you're basically betting bigger anyway
because half pot basically means pot
third pot means half pot 20 pot means
third pot it's like that's kind of
because the chips are worth more so you
may get even wrong ideas from watching
the final tables ah i see lena he bets
20 on this board this is what must be
good but no the big blind has to fold
more because it's icm whereas really to
make the hands indifferent which lena's
trying to make him different you may
need to be 80 percent you may need to
get 90 in a chip uv situation so i think
a lot of people actually get worse from
watching footage because they're
watching the wrong footage i'm not sure
if that makes sense but that's no it
makes a lot of sense and i remember also
throughout my career i learned a lot
from what you said playing versus other
players but also watching other players
let's say i remember especially when
solvers first came out and you know i
was a bit like ass always blah blah and
i knew also some other players that were
like a solvers but if you play against a
lot of guys who use a lot of solvers and
you indeed play against them and you
pick up things hey that actually makes a
lot of sense you're sort of indirectly
also using a solver because you're
looking at what other players are doing
hey that makes a lot of sense and in the
end your your strategy is actually still
for proof even though you didn't even
touch the solver but because you're
playing against other players or using
them and putting them in your tough
spots and you're like hey i'm gonna do
that as well because i understand it
you're still sort of
playing gto even though you never
touched the solver
yeah
so 100 100 reflecting on the on your big
career in both coaching
playing
i mean it's an ongoing career what so
far
has been
the most important thing that poker has
taught you
you would say this this journey of yours
tell me
um i guess well first of all to do
things for yourself not for others you
know like i said a lot of these
struggles or mental struggles was always
about trying to appease other people to
try to get other people to want to
see that i'm a winner in live poker to
get other people to say oh to be happy
that i'm number one should we get to
number one because you're happy for
yourself not because it makes somebody
else content you know uh similar with
your strategy right i was scared to play
my strategy because maybe graph techno
maybe european maybe other people they
like oh well that's not how i play so
it's a bad strategy right but make you a
thing for you not for other people like
every single thing i do i don't have a
blog i don't have to like try to show
off that way or anything anymore try to
get people to be approved of what i do
you know i do everything as long as i
think it's good and i review afterwards
and i'm happy i think that's why that's
why i do things now you know 100 just
for myself so that's the main thing it's
told me um and you know you had to learn
how to learn the hard way you know for
you know losing you know you lose lots
of money up just normally in poker you
uh
you have people doubting you you have
hate you have all this kind of stuff you
know it's quite a lot to take on again
not complaining it's quite a lot to take
on whereas like a young 22 year old 23
year old you know going i think and i
think most people must struggle a lot
through this in poker you know trying to
trying to seek the acceptance of their
peers is probably what every poker
player goes through from like 18 years
old to 25 years old you know and i think
a lot of the guys who are like older
school and successful they don't really
seek out that validation i don't think
ivy cares what other people think of him
you know he just does this thing you
know um
i think doll brunson is not sitting in
bobby's you're thinking oh
i wonder if source is thinking i'm
playing this limit street wrong you know
he just plays this thing and he's happy
with how he plays you know so i think uh
i think that's i think that's a really
important important thing what it
teaches you um
yeah is this a
is this a common thing adam
is it common to seek validation from
with us is that the question brennan yes
do you see this a lot in uh in in
players that you coach that they
struggle with these kind of problems
yeah i do i think especially as pat said
like the younger people when you're 18
to mid-20s you've got that kind of
wanting to prove other people
right or prove yourself right to the
people and very often you're judging
yourself based on what other people are
thinking about you and as a poker player
it's pretty risky to
say you're not going to get a job and
you're going to play poker
professionally it's a pretty ballsy
thing to see here and people are
watching you and your friends and your
family are kind of thinking well this is
a bit of a crazy decision so
subconsciously you're wanting to go i
know what i'm doing i'm smart i'm clever
i can make this work so yeah i think
it's really common until you have an
initial amount of success to do it to
validate yourself to the other people's
eyes and hopefully like if you have
success you get to a point where you
realize wait a second like i don't need
to do it for the people i can start
doing for myself and then you start
transitioning your motives more to more
six and glad things in terms of
achievements for yourself uh helping
other people out or just basically you
get past that kind of validation but
yeah i think it's almost
almost inevitable that that's going to
be the case just based on the fact that
you're going for something that's very
risky and that other people are doubting
you from the the outside it almost goes
without seeing that you're
you're going to want to prove to send
people that you're good at what you do
and also
as a poker player you put so much into
it like it's not like a
half-hearted pursuit like you put your
life into it a lot of players are they
give their
all the time and energy to the game so
when you do putting your identity into
your pursuit
of course you want it to work and of
course you want people to uh to validate
you and say yeah you're doing good at
this this occupation so uh i think it's
definitely common especially in the
younger generations and then yeah as you
as a as we're seeing i think we get to
uh the mature poker players especially
donald brunson's the ultimate example
where you do for your own reasons you do
you're playing poker for your own
achievements you don't care what other
people are seeing and yes it's a good
place to get to
it's
actually it's actually quite funny i'm
not sure if renny knows adam and i uh we
used to we used to run the same races
when we were younger uh like long
distance running races uh
and
uh i i guess adam was the yeah above me
i guess you were like the the one year
above me but would be basically i would
race first and then adam would race
afterwards we didn't realize this until
like i guess a couple of years ago um
but in running i would do long distance
running and i'm like the if you looked
at me you'd like especially at that age
you would think i was the least likely
long distance runner ever like to look
at i would turn up at these races uh
like big chunk big championships and i'd
be the smallest person by like seven
inches uh and i would be like the
stockiest person by far uh i joined a
running club and uh the my coach
nickname used to call me uh
fat santa
he used to call me fat santa and it used
to grab it used to drive me so mad uh
and i used to i did so well i used to
win all the races i was like the night
out as a city champion i won the
counties i went into counties uh and the
whole reason why i ran i hated running i
absolutely hated it but i only ran
because i wanted to prove this guy wrong
i wanted to prove the other people in
the ring i used to turn up the race
people used to laugh like i turned up on
like the line and these guys would laugh
like what what is he doing here he you
always have the person who's like last
in the race they're like oh this guy
must be terrible but i would win the
race but i wouldn't win it for me i'd
win it against them because i was so
tilted and angry at like not like it
wasn't validation and then i would show
up to like the meets where adam would
know there's like it's very clicky you
have the clicks you know like the good
runners like a gate said are you a
gateshead harrier yeah the gates of
harry's was actually very clicky like uh
you had the people who were like they
were like slightly better than the other
clubs or whatever and at first they used
to kind of laugh at me a little bit when
i showed up but then eventually they
would like try to get me into their
clicks as well and i used to hate that
and i quit once i got accepted into the
clique i quit straight away and i just
wished in poker i'd
realized that you know like look back on
that and realized okay why am i why am i
doing what am i doing i was chasing the
validation the same way as i was chasing
the validation from running you know
which i i was hating life but i was
hating running it was exactly the same
thing just replicating through my life
uh and it's just a bit sad that when
you're in your 20s you don't really look
back and try to find lessons from your
younger self even then i think most
people think of hindsight being when
you're like 50 or 60 looking back now
but really i think if you're 21 22
listen to the podcast maybe try to find
some hindsight from literally when
you're like 16 17 18 there's a lot to
learn from from those years you know
yeah i think it's if you don't learn the
lessons like you said you repeat the
same mistakes you'll seek validation and
another million things and then
hopefully like if like you have with
poca you'll find something that almost
gives you that validation that final
seal of approval and then you just drop
it and go right [ __ ] that i'm done with
the whole approval thing it's actually
funny because i remember you by your
surname because in in um in running you
always have the results sheet is the
initial and their surname so you still
see leonard's in your in your in your
name i think you because because you did
a lot of football you would didn't like
do the whole circuit you just show up
for certain races like win i'll be
honest guys just kind of nowhere uh but
yeah i remember your the year below me
but there were certain age groups where
you'd over overlap so if like say under
15s i could be a top here under 15 and
you could be a bottom yeah so we'd race
each other for the same year i sucked
across country i think you're actually a
really good cross-country runner um you
showed me some results a while ago where
you were really high up in some of the
really good cross country so yeah you
were talented across coming for sure and
yeah i think it's interesting to look
and go right as a
young 13 14 year old we were seeking
validation and it was from peer groups
it was from friends it's from family
it's just this like kind of kid who
wants to be accepted i want to be good
at what i'm doing just give me a badge
give me a stick a medal or something to
tell me i'm good and then you go into
your adult life and you still keep doing
the same things you start trying to get
university degrees so your parents feel
proud of you and then you start trying
to make some money so your friends think
you're cool and then you start trying to
go to vegas so you again you've got this
kind of
image that people can think you're a
good person so yeah i think it's one of
those things where when you're young
it's easy to fall into that trend and
i'm sure some people get to their 30s
and 40s and they're still kind of living
that model but it's really good to look
back and go wait a second like what
approval was i looking for why did i
need that why did i feel like i wasn't
enough for myself to uh to validate
myself and why did i need other people
to give me a kind of badge or a sticker
or something to make me feel good but i
think for you obviously you've come on a
full journey uh it feels like almost
like polka was your you're real growing
up where you really found out who you
wanted to be what you're passionate
about you've got a point now where i'm
guessing you don't give a [ __ ] what
anyone really thinks about you because
you're very self-assured you're very
confident and from the outside looking
in it's hard to
even imagine that you were somebody who
struggled with this because you're a
very confident outgoing person from the
from the outside and it's yes it's
really reassuring for people who know
you like the current version of you to
know that you struggled with that and
you had to uh go through phases and
evolutions on your journey to actually
get to a point where now you feel
comfortable now you just do your own
thing you can have your own strategies
you don't need to uh have other side
outside influences um influence you at
all so uh for you right now
how does it feel in terms of the things
that motivate you so
when you are young and you are doing
things for almost like approval of other
people in one way that kind of drives
you it's almost like a
easy fuel source it's like i need to do
this because i need to get approval now
you're at a point where you kind of
don't do anything like you're you've
approved your prove yourself you can do
this you've been the portrait game so
long you've achieved everything what is
it now at this stage your career that
still drives you that still gets you to
go you know what i do want to push
myself to be the best what is it now
that's different compared to what it was
back in the days
so i have two goals basically um
the first goal the first thing i really
like is playing series so i like to play
40 50 60 days at a time and uh
i can't i have to do all in i can't just
like go play okay i'm gonna play three
days a week or four i have to be like
i'm all in for this series i really
really love that so i look forward to it
for like scoop w coop and winter series
it's like three times in the year i know
i'm going to play 50 well let's say 40
plus days in a row if it's available if
the series lasts as long with
coronavirus it lasted for like a year at
one point which had series the whole
time but
i i basically i really like that period
of time uh i do bets against uh the two
best poke players in the world are like
tournaments on lena and c darwin they're
very famous they've been around for
literally ever
i bet against them every series we're
good friends it's like it's like rivalry
but in a fun way so i always choose a
partner a different partner every series
and we do a two versus two bet and for
the 60 days or 30 days whatever it is
whoever has the best results after these
days wins like a big side bet we usually
bet like 100k or 50k or whatever it is
uh like combined and um
i really look forward to that it's like
a challenge i'm like competing against
the best you know it's not like i'm
trying to play poker to get money off
the fish or the whales where the money's
come from
i want to put my money up against the
best players money and try to compete
and try to beat them and it's not just
about my strategy against their strategy
it's like who has the best mental
strength over 40 days who has the best
who's gonna have the best warm-ups who's
gonna have the best cooldowns it'll all
come together to who wins that bet and a
lot of luck of course as well i really
love
i really really love doing these series
so that's like to me i would do these
series if there's no money so it's not
like what motivates me to have a job
whatever this is like
if i had to pay to do this like 50k
which i do some serious um if i had to
pay to do this i would do it you know
like i would uh i would do i would
happily pay the admission fee you know
some people like to go to nightclubs
people some people like to
go to you know the maldives and spend
20k whatever it is i would happily pay
that money to experience this two months
like it's it's more fun for me than
going to like a theme park or whatever
uh i love that so um the whole like me
now being different places like
perfecting my strategy to come up
against them it's almost like you're
going to battle and go into war you
don't just turn up the battle you
prepare you do all this stuff you know
you talk to your you talk to your people
they talk to their people you know they
think oh well what's he going to be
doing you think what what are they going
to be doing you know um for me that's
just like so fun so i don't need to
motivate myself because i find it fun i
find
that i don't need to you know like i'm
lucky i always say this like let's say i
liked playing fifa instead of poker like
you probably don't make much money
playing fifa you know you have to have a
job i'm just so lucky that poker somehow
is what i love to do and it pays you
like it's just it's almost crazy you
know like i don't know
yeah so it sounds like you always want
to challenge yourself against the best
put yourself in situations where you
need to come with a strategy and
approach to uh yeah stay on top and yeah
i love that that's the just the raw
motive like it doesn't need like you
don't need psyched up you do this for
free you do this just um out of
enjoyment purely so other players like
some people they listen to this and
going wow i wish i had that but for me
poker has been with grinds like i want
to get be able to have a successful
career but i mean for me poker's hard
work and i've got to put hours in what
would you say to those people who are
trying to uh get to your position
they're trying to get to the top but
they're almost an unfair advantage
because you're doing it for fun and
they're trying to get themselves to uh
to willpower the way to uh to an outcome
so what would you say some players who
may be struggling with motivation to uh
pursue their goals at poker what would
you say to them in terms of maybe
explaining the spanish my passion spot
that you've got
i would say quit i mean it's probably
not the answer you want but i was it
quit like you know i mean i'm not this
guy at all like
i hate like
like meditation i hate all like
spiritual stuff like i don't hate it
it's just it's not for me um but that's
not me at all but i i don't i don't like
so much like motivational stuff whatever
but you i really do think you have one
life and there's so much different
things you can do in life uh to make you
happy to feel really fulfilled um
i i know the feeling of fulfillment
because i love it so much so like if you
don't feel that
feeling you sometimes don't know
what the feeling how good the feeling is
and like
again i don't like to be that guy but i
promise you the feeling of feeling so
fulfilled is such a good feeling there's
no feeling like it ever like anything
nothing compares so if you don't feel it
you have to get out and find
you have to find it somewhere it may be
it's in some something else you know
you have to find the passion and if you
don't if you spend your time doing poker
and you spend your time closed away from
potentially doing other things
then it's very
likely you won't find that and then you
you'll never feel that fulfillment you
know so
yeah you have to
you have to you have to get out to give
yourself a chance to to find fulfillment
because that's what life again
i don't i don't want to be that guy but
life is about finding that fulfillment
and the end goal of life is finding what
makes you happy right it's not about
plodding along or grinding long you have
to find your happiness so if if you're
spending all your time in something
which doesn't give you that full full
fulfillment where you feel i've
completed life i succeed and succeed and
this is what i set out to do you have to
quit you know you have to do something
else because it's just holding you back
and again like i really i don't like
these motivational speeches all that
kind of
i don't know
so much like self-development books or
whatever but
i think it's not that big of a statement
to say that you need to find fulfillment
you know
yeah yeah i think sometimes people fall
into the trap of feeling they need to
get somewhere first it's like i need to
uh have some money in my bankroll i need
to tick off this achievement and then
i'll find the thing that makes me happy
and fulfilled and very often like you
said it's like just get out now and like
find that thing that makes you fulfilled
and on the way you'll get that success
most likely unless you say you play fifa
but even then you probably make money
playing people these days yeah
yeah so yeah i think it's really good
advice to um don't try and force it i
think that's another thing as well
sometimes i think people
are trying to almost like put like a
around peg into a square hole they're
trying to make themselves feel motivated
you haven't found that thing that makes
you feel alive keep looking keep looking
life's life's a long game like we've got
many opportunities to find that thing
we're passionate about and yeah i think
one of the good role models you've been
in the poker world is you love poker
like there's no fake in it like anyone
watch your instagram stories on a sunday
i watch them all and you're just so
enthusiastic about playing poker like
all these years later you can't help it
so i think people if poc is not your
thing who cares finding miguel spirit is
your thing to put all your energy into
once you find it then all of a sudden
you don't need to worry about motivation
because you've got it you've got that
drive and you want to get better so yeah
really really good advice there
run if you've got any airpod in
questions or any questions around
reflecting looking back in the
career
uh i think i got uh one last question uh
for patrick
um
you i also saw on on browsing through
your instagram before this uh
conversation that you were indeed
leading up to the big final battle in
may and then afterwards vegas and you
mentioned the side packs against elena
and darwin
what are some things that
you feel like
are still current leaks that you have
that you still need to improve upon in
order to really crush it this summer
interesting yeah i mean
i think uh strategy's forever evolving
like i know that
i have like a base of my strategy but i
know that there's so much stuff i just
don't know you know like i'm not precise
i like um european big influence like i
go back to him a lot but he is a big
advocate of being precise being really
precise about things not being things
like so half-assed like not thinking oh
yeah this is like my like let's say
button opens and you're thinking okay
well what's my strategy in the big blind
it's like which hands do i shove 20 big
ones deep it's like oh yeah i'm going to
shove some asacs i'm going to shove some
stupid connectors i'm going to ship some
uh like low pocket pairs whatever like
the way that european approaches it's
like okay i'm going to show two sister
sixes i'm going to show ace deuce to a6
because of the block because of some
blocker effects i'm going to show 10 8
to the 10 seven suited i'm going to call
1090 queen tennessee because they have
better uh eevee in the call node
whatever like that's two different ways
to to have things it's like one okay
this is my overall strategy and then two
is and this is my precise strategy so
what this is what over the last six
months or so of playing like i played 60
days around christmas i had an overall
strategy right um and then now it's
about making it as precise as possible
so it's about okay like i i'm over on
king high boards i'm over betting the
turn like that's my strategy okay like
then which exact hands are falling there
which king x am i putting into my check
node because of blocker effects to maybe
uh have more v or to protect my range to
have some calls versus bet check bet etc
stuff like that so i haven't like really
precise i feel like right now i know my
game plan pretty well i know when i bet
big i know when i bet small i know which
hand i know my overall strategy of
calling the button i know my overall
strategy of re-jamming the big blind uh
of course i know selective combos of
course i know
which i know i see the aces right i know
i see bed top side i know well sometimes
uh but
uh
but it's all about having that as making
it as precise as possible so every
series you turn up to your strategy
doesn't change of going okay
you know i play this strategy now okay
well i play this other strategy in the
next series between scoop and w coop you
play basically the same strategy but the
your roi or your ev is going to come
from that strategy being as precise as
possible every single combo being as
precise as possible and that's why i
have like 5 000 hand issues to go
through now through all of these things
which are kind of borderline hands okay
is this one going in there or is it
going in here is this one
is there more even checking this one
back or is it moy v and over bet in this
one whatever it may be so just being
precise but i will never know every
single combo in every single node every
single time that's why i spend two to
three months now being as precise as
possible but also being acceptant and
forgiving to yourself
that i'm not i'm not gonna know i'm
gonna show up in scoop and i'm gonna
face some spots and i'm not gonna know
if king nine's an over bet or if king
tends the line for an overbet sometimes
be next at times
i felt like
not like a fraud what's the word uh
what's the word where
you feel like you're not as good as
imposter syndrome you know
so much in the middle of my career i
thought i had imposter syndrome because
i didn't know what to do with a certain
combo i said oh well graphy would know
oh a european would know well odama
would know but they're improving in
poker every day too so they don't know
everything either right but i felt this
impostor syndrome a lot through my
career that i didn't know what to do
with exact combos in certain spots right
but now i'm very acceptant and very
forgiving i'm like okay i don't know
it's fine i'll know next time or i'll
save this or i'll be more precise next
time i may not know the exact stuff i'll
be more precise every time i play and i
think that's just that's what i can
improve on i think that's what everyone
can improve on i think if people try to
change you know strategy from gun a to a
to z different strategy they're going to
fail because they're going to be poor
versions of other people rather than
being the better version of yourself and
to be a better version of yourself you
keep your strategy you keep what works
you just make it as precise as possible
um
so hopefully that's the same answer for
everybody hopefully everyone would
answer it the same way but maybe
i don't know maybe maybe they wouldn't
and i think there's also a very big
difference between going into a theory
expecting you to be precise or striving
towards
be precise right that's a very big
difference i think expecting and then
facing reality that exactly we just said
yeah you don't know if the threshold the
valid threshold was king nine over bet
or king ten over but you it's it's hard
to know right exactly in all notes but
if you if you strive and are forgiving
for yourself when you when you're off on
combo when you're out for combo here i
think that's uh that's the way to uh
yeah to see staying mentally sane right
in this game
for sure for sure to share and also
people may some people's goals may be to
be as precise but maybe their goal needs
to be if there's 40 days of a series
that if last series they played 22 days
out 40 how can they now play 28 days in
the next series you know because that's
where the difference and money they make
in the series is going to be it doesn't
matter if it's king 9 or king 10
necessarily if their goal is that
they're physically unfit enough if their
goal is they're mentally not well enough
if their goal is that uh
whatever it may be you know uh allows
them to only play 22 instead of 28
that's what they should focus on between
the series you know right now i i have
not taken a day off in the series in
like i think four years but for the
first four years of my career it took
lots of days off you know i couldn't
mentally handle the swings i couldn't
physically handle the swings i wasn't
prepared for it i didn't have good
warm-ups i didn't have good cool downs i
didn't have my sleep schedule perfected
to a way which works for me you know i
didn't have like my food done like i
like i have it now whatever it may be so
for most people that goal shouldn't
necessarily be strategic precision it
should be
um you know mental mental well-being or
physical well-being to strive towards
playing as many days as possible for
that strategy their strategy is probably
fine if they're a winning player you
need to play more days you know until
you get to the goal like it took like i
played 100 i played 40 out of 40 days
but i've been playing for
15 years you know so it's like i didn't
just do this the first year the first
time i played this group i played two
days out 40 probably it's been a gradual
process you know so when you now go to a
series you mentioned that i heard you
quickly mentioning like food prepping
warming up and cooling down him you know
because it's a long grind could you what
are some what are some things that you
do when a siri comes along in order for
you to perform all these 40 days
so these 40 days are written off from
everything else so
the whole thing is just for this so i
will sleep
uh
i will sleep late because i know that
for peak performance i need to be
performing well late in the night 2 am 3
am 4 am because this is when final
tables are going to be around so i need
to be as awake as possible at 2 a.m to
play so this means i need to be ready to
sleep at like 6 a.m because i need to be
you know my peak time will be like four
hours before i sleep or whatever like i
need to be really peak then because i'm
going to be making decisions for lots of
money at
5pm in the afternoon the stakes i play
are going to be you know 100 200 300 the
stakes i play at 4am are gonna be you
know for houses for cars for careers for
my life you know for the rest of life
for my retirement whatever it may be so
i need to that's the main thing like i
need to be able to perform between
midnight and 4am which i think most
people start getting tired and all that
kind of stuff uh so that's number one
number two is i make things
uh i make things as consistent as
possible so i only eat the same food for
every day every day feels like it's just
the next day i'm doing the same today's
what i did yesterday so it doesn't
matter what the food is doesn't even
matter if it's super healthy or whatever
but i'll eat the same food for all these
days i'll have the same coffees at the
same times so that my mood's not
fluctuating throughout the time so i
will always make sure i have a coffee at
say 3 p.m and then 4 p.m something like
that i won't one day randomly have a
coffee at 1 pm and then 7 p.m i try to
stay as consistent as possible so that
just today feels like it's going to be
the same as yesterday i'm not like
changing anything uh i make sure that i
sleep i try to sleep for eight hours
exactly not too much not too little i
try to make sure i always cool down for
the exact amount of time so for like 90
minutes um i just try to be i don't try
to change day to day it's just okay i'm
gonna do the same as yesterday i'm gonna
do the same tomorrow is what i do today
it's just it doesn't matter what it is
you just need to make your own routine
you know i'm not saying copy my routine
i'm saying find your team to make
consistency and then roll out that
consistency you know and i think taking
days off kills the consistency so let's
say you're consistent monday to thursday
then you take off friday's your day off
usually your day off you're going to be
eating some different food you're going
to be
sleeping differently maybe you have
alcohol maybe you do whatever maybe you
work out at a different time of the day
it could be whatever sometimes your days
off kill you
sometimes if you feel like you need a
day off it's better to just have a
slightly lighter session don't play
20 tables play four play six tables
chill a little bit i just realized i'm
gonna have a softer day today don't take
the day off necessarily because you just
completely kill the consistency that
you've made from the monday to thursday
you know because you know you're telling
your body okay we do it's time to do
something different and then you come
back to saturday you're like okay well
the body is like saying oh well are we
doing this are we doing that the body
doesn't know the mind doesn't know you
know um
so and like a a week before the series
start is that like a week where you take
off or are you x-ray in the lab uh
the week before is all about getting the
sleep schedule the i basically will plan
the the schedule we'll start the week
before i can't just jump in the first
game like okay well this is how we're
doing it body this is how we're doing in
mind you know like you start climatizing
towards that time so like i don't just
fly from from like a live stop and then
start playing online where in live pokey
play 12 pm until 8 pm i can't just do
that and turn up on the sunday but okay
well let's perform you know
it's not it's not really going to work
um
so that the time before is not
necessarily about studying or strategy
because it's uh i've already done that
for like the two months or three months
before but it might be about getting
used to playing lots of tables again
because now i have my laptop i'm playing
just six tables on a sunday or whatever
eight tables i need to get used to being
in front of a huge screen with 30 tables
so maybe i need to play a week not to
make money not to do anything but just
getting used to my eyes getting used to
the screen to being used to the office
maybe i need to make sure the internet's
okay maybe make sure there's no stress
you know
find some whatever it may be you know
like fix all the problems before the
before is a problem essentially all
right
thank you for sharing man that's a great
approach in my opinion it sounds uh
sounds very good adam do you have any
final questions before we let uh we let
patrick go no i'd like to be respectful
of pads time i know you're deep in the
lab right now and you're studying like
crazy so i appreciate you taking some
time out of your busy day to speak with
us and yeah we've learned a lot together
i mean i'll have a bit of a summary
after this and yeah i'm sure audience is
going to love it so thanks for your time
perfect thanks guys thanks a lot keep
doing these podcasts they're great i i
will keep watching your podcast and
learning you've had some really good
guests on so far so uh yeah taking some
wisdom from those guys hopefully all
right thank you very much
keep it up
all right that was the conversation we
had with patrick i'm gonna repeat myself
here like i usually do at the end of
this podcast but
man man what a bunch of wisdom was that
adam
yeah such a great episode hopefully you
guys watching got a lot of takeaways
one of my biggest things i like about
pads is his passion for poker and he's
been in the game for so long like 14 15
years he's still at the very top of his
game he's still hungrier than ever he's
still got so much more to give to the
game and it does it just comes out and
every time he speaks how much he just
loves poker um so yeah i'm really
impressed by his longevity and his
passion for the game one of the main
things i got from this conversation was
when paz was talking about
how when he was younger he talked about
his running career but also football and
poca where he was basically doing things
for approval he wanted people to uh to
like him to uh think he was making good
choices they think he was to validate
him and it wasn't until he had a lot of
success in poca that he finally got to a
stage where that wasn't the case anymore
then he even talked about even when he
was crushing all the
online games he still had this almost
chip on his shoulder they really wanted
to go to the live scenes just to prove
to the people that he could do it and it
wasn't until he had that live success at
the end that i finally realized wait a
minute what am i doing this isn't making
me happy it doesn't make me fulfilled so
i think it's a really good like kind of
lesson to learn always like reconnect
with yourself and try to do things for
yourself and not for other people when
you're young you're coming up and you're
starting out and stuff it is hard like
you do want to impress people you do
want to look good to your friends your
family's opinion of you does matter but
you do want to get to the point where
you're doing things that make you happy
not other people so paz is a great
example of that he's got a point now
where i don't really think he cares
whatsoever what people think of him but
he talked about a lot of his career he
was doing things to uh validate himself
in other people's eyes it wasn't really
a lot of success i was able to to get
past that that was one of the main
takeaways which i think a lot of people
can relate to and also
learn some lessons from and i really
liked what paz was saying at the very
end about when he's preparing for this
series coming up how methodical he is
and he's talking about basically getting
his body clock and his mind prepared for
what's coming next and he's very much
approaching like an athlete approaches
the olympics like it's having the same
wake-up routine it's the same sleep
routine it's mentally rehearsing how
things are going to feel it's having the
same meals at the same time so your body
knows what to do it's rehearsing the
actions you're going to take some terms
of playing more tables so i really liked
all those performance and kind of
mindsets um strategies he was using in
order to optimize his performance ready
for the next series so really high level
stuff there at the end and yeah anyone
who wants to perform at a high level
having consistent routines that allow
you to uh perform well is so so key so
if you're someone who
has a random schedule you wake up all
over the place if you want to perform
well for a block of time whether it's
two weeks a month or whatever it's
really good to dial in everything around
that performance and get as um kind of
consistent and regimented with the
routine as possible so yeah loads of
lessons from pads today such a great
guest to have on what were some of the
things that you learned there right here
yeah it's what you said like the overall
professionalism that he has towards
being a poker player i think that's
something that really took out obviously
he has a lot of experience right and
this you know it didn't come it didn't
come at the start after i think he
talked about 15 years of experience he
became more professional and
professional every time uh i really
liked what he talked about
in terms of trying to become the best
version of yourself you want to kind of
go inwards and be like okay what made me
i think he gave the example why was i
good enough to move out of my home game
into the big casino for example what is
that strength and how can i build my
strategy around that obviously you
should still
try to get in information from other
players right that's something that they
also mentioned if someone else put you
in a tough spot like hey oh wow pretty
cool he puts me in this tough spot what
can i learn from this and try to add
that to your game but he he said
repeatedly to not try to become for
example a bad version of pots you know
try to look at how he plays and try to
copy him no you can learn from him but
stay true to your own strength i think
that that was
very important
uh uh for me probably the main takeaway
of this conversation he also talked
about how in the end the most important
thing is yeah who won the most money and
people often go towards improving their
strategy where he said yeah maybe you
should try to see if you can increase
your volume by learning how to play more
tables for example that's also a way and
often a quicker way to increase your
overall winnings and thus become a
better poker player his definition of
being a good poker player in the end was
clearly just net result right either
bb-100 roi
net one in the end that's going to be
the best poker player
he also gets some good advice of why you
know in this opinion his students failed
at bit b i remember being very
aggressive in any format that poker just
naturally works if you're playing too
passive yeah
playing that kind of playing not to lose
instead of playing to win aggressive
poker usually wins you money so that's
also a very good takeaway but yeah i
mean we talked for so many hours a lot
of wisdom hard to recap i want to thank
