what was actually correct
okay so when I say that I didn't know

okay so when I say that I didn't know
Theory back then

[20:33]
Theory back then

[20:33]
Theory back then
um I did know fundamental concepts in

[20:35]
um I did know fundamental concepts in

[20:35]
um I did know fundamental concepts in
theory so things like pod odds which

[20:40]
theory so things like pod odds which

[20:40]
theory so things like pod odds which
lead to minimum defense frequency so how

[20:43]
lead to minimum defense frequency so how

[20:43]
lead to minimum defense frequency so how
much you need to defend versus a bet or

[20:46]
much you need to defend versus a bet or

[20:46]
much you need to defend versus a bet or
a raise

[20:48]
a raise

[20:48]
a raise
and also optimal bluffing frequency So

[20:51]
and also optimal bluffing frequency So

[20:51]
and also optimal bluffing frequency So
based on your bet size again same as

[20:54]
based on your bet size again same as

[20:54]
based on your bet size again same as
minimum defense frequency how much you

[20:56]
minimum defense frequency how much you

[20:56]
minimum defense frequency how much you
need to be bluffing and how much you

[20:58]
need to be bluffing and how much you

[20:58]
need to be bluffing and how much you
need to be value betting also known as

[21:00]
need to be value betting also known as

[21:00]
need to be value betting also known as
valuable F ratio

[21:02]

that's often enough to be a very strong

exploitative player yeah if you put that

next to the data and say well this only

next to the data and say well this only
has to work 40 of the time but it's

[21:16]
has to work 40 of the time but it's

[21:16]
has to work 40 of the time but it's
working 50 of the time well do the math

[21:19]
working 50 of the time well do the math

[21:19]
working 50 of the time well do the math
yeah

[21:21]
yeah

[21:21]
yeah
so you can be a pretty strong

[21:23]
so you can be a pretty strong

[21:23]
so you can be a pretty strong

like twice as hard to fix because you

[27:36]
like twice as hard to fix because you

yeah you also have to identify what it

[27:40]
yeah you also have to identify what it

[27:40]
yeah you also have to identify what it
is because let's say for example you

[27:42]
is because let's say for example you

[27:42]
is because let's say for example you
overfold the river in a certain spot you

[27:44]
overfold the river in a certain spot you

[27:44]
overfold the river in a certain spot you
have to identify if it's well am I just

not arriving with the hands that it's

[27:51]
not arriving with the hands that it's

defending and therefore I always fold
right it's like two of the ways I think

on the Flop you didn't look ahead and

[28:20]
on the Flop you didn't look ahead and

[28:20]
on the Flop you didn't look ahead and
you you didn't adjust for what's about

you you didn't adjust for what's about
to come very likely in the future and

didn't adjust your frequencies or your

[28:27]
didn't adjust your frequencies or your

[28:27]
didn't adjust your frequencies or your
range construction accordingly

[28:30]
yeah I agree with that especially like

[28:33]
yeah I agree with that especially like

[28:33]
yeah I agree with that especially like
what comes to mind is bluffing so if you

[28:35]
what comes to mind is bluffing so if you

what comes to mind is bluffing so if you
get to the river and you don't know what

then you've got their actual frequency
that they three bet

probability distribution that just means

that there's two states like a coin flip

that there's two states like a coin flip
could be either heads or tails either

they were bluffing or value-betting or

and so that's a fairly easy thing to

but it's like if you have

[2:24:56]
but it's like if you have

[2:24:56]
but it's like if you have
400 trials on a sample

[2:24:59]
400 trials on a sample

[2:24:59]
400 trials on a sample
and

[2:25:01]
and

[2:25:01]
and
you want to be using like a let's say a

[2:25:06]
you want to be using like a let's say a

[2:25:06]
you want to be using like a let's say a
90 confidence interval

[2:25:09]
90 confidence interval

[2:25:09]
90 confidence interval
um the statistical uncertainty and

[2:25:11]
um the statistical uncertainty and

[2:25:11]
um the statistical uncertainty and
that's that might be like four percent

[2:25:13]
that's that might be like four percent

[2:25:13]
that's that might be like four percent
and so if somebody's three bet over 400

[2:25:16]
and so if somebody's three bet over 400

[2:25:16]
and so if somebody's three bet over 400
trials is 15

[2:25:19]
trials is 15

[2:25:19]
trials is 15
then what it actually means is that

[2:25:21]
then what it actually means is that

[2:25:21]
then what it actually means is that
their three bet is not 15 it might be

[2:25:25]
their three bet is not 15 it might be

[2:25:25]
their three bet is not 15 it might be
15 plus or minus four percent at a 90

[2:25:29]
15 plus or minus four percent at a 90

[2:25:29]
15 plus or minus four percent at a 90
percent confidence interval so you can

[2:25:32]
percent confidence interval so you can

[2:25:32]
percent confidence interval so you can
be 90 confident that the three bet is

[2:25:35]
be 90 confident that the three bet is

[2:25:35]
be 90 confident that the three bet is
within that range but that's all you can

[2:25:38]
within that range but that's all you can
