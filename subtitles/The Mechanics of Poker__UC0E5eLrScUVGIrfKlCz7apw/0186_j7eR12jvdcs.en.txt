further Ado let's start the pod

[03:16]
further Ado let's start the pod
alright there is Mr Patrick Howard thank
you for coming on the pod
thanks for having me
Patrick you have been uh you have
actually had from what I understood
digging a bit in your story you've had
two poker playing careers one of them uh

[03:32]
two poker playing careers one of them uh
starting at the age that was maybe not
the most TOS approved I think you were
around 12 playing uh a bunch of online
poker together with your brother Nick
Howard who I'm sure many of many of the
listeners are familiar with after a
couple of years from what I understood

[03:45]
couple of years from what I understood
is you lost some interest in poker and
started to travel and pursue education
in physics and that's what you actually
mentioned helped you in your approach to
Poker so definitely in Curious later on
the part to ask you how that Transitions
and what kind of skills transition that

[04:01]
and what kind of skills transition that
helped you in poker
uh giving your brother Nick was still
very big into poker though both playing
and coaching in 2018 you did get sucked
back into the game and joined detox both
as a student as a coach from what I
understood and I was curious like what

[04:15]
understood and I was curious like what
is it about the game of poker that put
you back in and why does it remain so
interesting to you even up until today
I don't really know why exactly I got
sucked back in except I think at that

[04:30]
sucked back in except I think at that
point in my life I didn't have too many
other options or at least it didn't feel
that way I had tried to do a PhD in
biophysics and I very quickly realized
that it wasn't for me that I I didn't
really have a future in that and then

[04:47]
really have a future in that and then
after that I just worked in restaurants
for a couple years I thought that I
wanted to own a pizzeria or a sandwich
shop or something and I think I might
still do something like that in the
future maybe way down the road but I

[05:00]
future maybe way down the road but I
realized after two years of working in
restaurants that that is just like an
incredibly difficult career and I felt
kind of burnt out from that
and then it was just sort of a
serendipitous thing I went on this
retreat with Nick and some of the other
detox guys and I hadn't really thought

[05:18]
detox guys and I hadn't really thought
about poker in a very long time except
talking with Nick but then to actually
be there and to see it and they just
happened to be making a ton of money at
that time because Poker Master had just

[05:30]
that time because Poker Master had just
come out and they were like crushing
these app games
um I just kind of
I didn't have much else at the time and
I I was looking very appealing to me and
I don't know something just shifted and
I just knew like that I wanted to get

[05:46]
I just knew like that I wanted to get
back into poker
and what about up until today for
example you could maybe do other things
as well why why do you keep why do you
stay in poker and why the smoker remain
interesting to you or what do you do to

[06:00]
interesting to you or what do you do to
keep poker interesting for you maybe
that's actually a better question
yeah so it's been like about five or six
years since I started poker again
and initially you know I just loved
getting back into the strategy and

[06:15]
getting back into the strategy and
competing I feel like the first sort of
chapter the first couple of years was
just proving that I could beat high
stakes and make good money just playing
the game
and then I had another chapter where I
was coaching for Nick's stable I was

[06:31]
was coaching for Nick's stable I was
like the the head coach of Poker detox
cfp
and that challenge was like can I
actually teach low stakes and micro
Stakes players to beat this game for a
significant amount of money

[06:46]
significant amount of money
um more recently I've been working with
high stakes players and to be honest the
the actual poker side of things the
strategy
it's not as
um
you know exciting as it was in the very

[07:01]
you know exciting as it was in the very
beginning when I started things just do
get a little bit stale over time but I
think what motivates me the most now is
just the people that I get to work with
um Matthew Marinelli who was just on the
podcast before me and I'm actually in

[07:16]
podcast before me and I'm actually in
his apartment right now renting out his
apartment for a month
he's in Canada right now playing on GG
poker
um and a bunch of other people that I
work with they're just like there's such
good poker players I really admire their

[07:31]
good poker players I really admire their
dedication and their work ethic
and yeah right now that's kind of the
main thing that motivates me to keep
going I'm just like you know kind of
um awestruck by the work ethic of some
of these guys and I'm just like trying

[07:45]
of these guys and I'm just like trying
to keep up
yeah it's more so the the people that
you get to surround yourself with on a
daily basis that that's really something
that attracts you
yeah it gives you momentum I think or
inertia keeps you going yeah for sure

[08:00]
inertia keeps you going yeah for sure
you know if you have a little bit of a
lace Dairy you feel a little bit sorry
for yourself or like ah and then you
have all these people around you and
you're like oh [ __ ] yeah okay the
standard is quite high and you
immediately get pushed to a higher level
yourself as well when you when you go
back into poker you actually moved up

[08:15]
back into poker you actually moved up
the stakes really quickly you started to
play I think 200 an hour within like six
months or so you are already playing
2kml why was it that you were able to
excel so quickly you think
um I think that

[08:30]
um I think that
I had a different approach to the game
where I focused a lot on exploits and I
was able to
look at uh population Tendencies and
come up with a lot of really effective
exploits
so you know I didn't really know very

[08:47]
so you know I didn't really know very
much
about Theory at all at that time I was
kind of just clicking buttons to be
completely honest and I was playing in
Anonymous games so I was able to get
away with that you know people can't
really

[09:00]
really
counter-exploy you
so
I would say the exploits you know were
really what were making me the money
um and I didn't really feel like I was
doing
too much of anything special but when I

[09:15]
too much of anything special but when I
look back you know I was really just
only focusing on poker it was my entire
life at the time for Better or For Worse
I think it helped the results but you
know the work life balance was really
not there at all

[09:30]
not there at all
so I did approach it with a really I
think a strong work ethic and I thought
that that was kind of normal until I
started coaching a lot more like other
low stakes players and then I saw that
they really weren't approaching the game

[09:46]
they really weren't approaching the game
like that so I think that set me apart
initially
so you also notice when starting to work
with students that it the Strategic
aspect was maybe only a small part that
you had to teach them it was mainly like
hey guys uh you need to put in a certain

[10:01]
hey guys uh you need to put in a certain
work ethic when it's a work ethic what
what kind of practical things are we
talking about
yeah so I think if you're struggling at
low stakes to make money and to move up
in the stakes you probably have like a
logistical issue

[10:15]
logistical issue
so I think a lot of low stakes players
treat poker more like a video game hobby
than they would like a serious job or
you know like you would treat your
education if you were in college or
something
um
just simple things first of all like

[10:32]
just simple things first of all like
playing on a schedule so
You're Gonna Play maybe four hours a
night
um I would recommend figuring what is
the best possible time for you to play
when when are the games the best

[10:45]
when when are the games the best
and play and I was just playing like
four hours per night five days a week on
average
but I had a very strict schedule that I
would stick to and this is another thing
that I just kind of thought was standard
but I realize now that a lot of poker

[11:01]
but I realize now that a lot of poker
players will just play poker when they
feel like it
[Music]
um
I also had like a pretty
rigid study routine so like every
morning after I played a session the
night before I would go over every

[11:16]
night before I would go over every
single pot that I had played over I
think 10 big Blends but sometimes I
would go down to five big blends and I
would just make sure that I could
justify every single decision
uh that I was making

[11:32]
uh that I was making
and so you know things like that I think
I just had a more serious routine uh
than a lot of low stakes players did you
were also active as a coach correct at
detox how did you compliment your

[11:45]
detox how did you compliment your
brother Nick in that coaching for detox
in the beginning
well when I first started at detox it
was a very small group it was like
maybe 10 people I think even less and so
the way that Nick coached was really to
just get everybody together on a call or

[12:02]
just get everybody together on a call or
in a room and he would just teach like
he would he would talk to the players
and there really wasn't a lot of
curriculum or like you know physical
materials that we could give students so
the first thing that I started doing was

[12:16]
the first thing that I started doing was
just I would I would try to take as much
information and knowledge as I could
from Nick and put it into documents and
and this is just like how I learn
so it wasn't just for the stable but it

[12:31]
so it wasn't just for the stable but it
was also for me because I wanted to just
have everything on paper that he was
saying uh because it helped my study
process
so that was just how I started
um was just by uh sort of recording and

[12:45]
um was just by uh sort of recording and
documenting everything that Nick was
saying so I think that the way we
complimented each other was that you
know he had a lot of ideas in his head
and I was sort of the organizational
component to a lot of that
that seems very very complementary to
each other

[13:02]
besides Nick anyone else that comes up
that had a very big influence in your
poker career or your current success
that comes up
honestly not really

[13:16]
honestly not really
um I kind of stayed pretty insulated
and I still am uh I do I am a lot more
active on social media now and so I do
kind of but that's mostly just me
putting ideas out there I don't have too
much discourse I still to this day I

[13:32]
much discourse I still to this day I
haven't really
I think I purchased Maybe
One poker course
in my life and I haven't really read a
lot of poker books or anything
so I kind of just got like my basic

[13:45]
so I kind of just got like my basic
knowledge of theory from Nick he was
always there if I had a question about
mandatory defense frequency or you know
optimal bluffing frequency basic
concepts and Theory like that
and then I I just sort of came up

[14:00]
and then I I just sort of came up
with my own way of looking at the game
which I think uh was definitely a
benefit I will shout out solo Costa
because we studied together back in 2019
and

[14:15]
and
him and his business partner matteus
they run metagame uh which is a it
started out as a Brazilian stable but I
think they're Global now
they were the first ones who introduced
me really to

[14:30]
me really to
uh hand to note
we were using it at poker detox before
they came along but they were starting
to use it for things that we didn't even
know you could use it for like analyzing
Bluff catching spots like actually
looking at range composition

[14:47]
looking at range composition
um so when he showed me kind of the
stuff that you could do with that
program that's when I got really
inspired to learn hand to know and and
you know learn like everything in that
program could do so it's interesting

[15:00]
program could do so it's interesting
because we actually have Mateos on I
think one of the one of the earlier
podcasts that we did and he actually
mentioned that he got inspired from from
Nick if I'm a mistaken he won I think a
free coaching car or something with Nick
and then but he also mentioned yeah with

[15:15]
and then but he also mentioned yeah with
his free stuff I basically already
builded everything in hand to note
myself and then it's funny that then you
start to talk with them and then they
teach you it's funny how these things go
go back and forth yeah yeah that was
2018. I remember that call that they did
and Mateus uh couldn't I don't think he

[15:32]
and Mateus uh couldn't I don't think he
could speak any English or just very
little at the time I think solo could
speak a little bit so it was like very
hard for us to even communicate with one
another now they both speak amazing
English and it's it's just amazing to
see how far those guys have come they've

[15:46]
see how far those guys have come they've
like just totally crushed it
um but yeah so like Nick had used hand
to note initially to study the
population's defense frequencies and and
to prove that people were over folding
in a ton of different spots but those
guys they recreated all of that work and

[16:02]
guys they recreated all of that work and
then they did even more and I think we
had maybe I don't know if we'd gotten a
little bit lazy or if we just kind of
reached a dead end we thought with hand
to note but then they came and then they
showed you know we not only recreated
your work but we expanded on it a lot

[16:16]
your work but we expanded on it a lot
and it was kind of this like oh [ __ ]
moment like I have to you know we got to
get back on on top of the ball here and
like you know
with a very Advanced strategy is like oh
you know sometimes you get a bit in your

[16:31]
you know sometimes you get a bit in your
comfort zone right like oh I got this
all figured out and then someone else
has to come along that does something
revolutionary and he's like oh wait I
haven't thought about this
yeah these type of people
yeah there's a saying that I like I

[16:45]
yeah there's a saying that I like I
forget who said it but it's only the
paranoid survive and I think you need a
little bit of that where you have to be
looking around and not underestimate
your competition if you see somebody
doing something good you do kind of have
to sometimes be like okay we're doing

[17:00]
to sometimes be like okay we're doing
that and make sure that they don't just
completely overtake you
it's funny but then from
like um as you mentioned like you don't
really consume other poker content I'm
actually a bit of the opposite I'm also
a little bit of a fan I like to hear how
other people think about so anything

[17:15]
other people think about so anything
that's sort of available I try to uh I
try to get my hands on to see like okay
what's your approach or especially also
from a coaching perspective for a
Content making perspective I'm also
curious to learn from that myself okay
how do you deliver your content oh maybe
I can improve here

[17:32]
yeah and I will say that at this point I
have a lot of people on my team who are
a lot more dialed in to the poker
industry and they will show me like I
don't know for example just last month

[17:46]
don't know for example just last month
um there's a new solver called Rocket
solver I think that's what it's called I
haven't used it personally but a few
people on my team are starting to use it
a lot because it's good for like
multi-way stuff and bomb pots it does
that all that like really quickly and so

[18:02]
that all that like really quickly and so
I it's not like a badge of honor to be
in on your own little island I think
there there can be some good things from
that you can have really unique ideas
about the game
um but you know as you get further and
further it just becomes more of a

[18:15]
further it just becomes more of a
weakness so I've just kind of plugged
that weakness by having good people on
my team who can show me different stuff
yeah I noticed it with ourselves as well
and my community even though some people
for example there are students but you
can learn a lot from them as well
especially if they are at that point of

[18:31]
especially if they are at that point of
their career where at a super eager they
spend 24 7 on poker they will stay on
top of things and they will sometimes
you play oh no you can do this nowadays
way easier with this program over this
program so this way you can still yeah
stay on top of the game basically

[18:46]
stay on top of the game basically
yeah and if you're a player you can
apply this as well and it's really
important just to have other people
around to study with have a little bit
of community
um obviously it depends on the quality
of your community you don't really just

[19:01]
of your community you don't really just
want to be surrounding yourself with
anybody but you know you just have these
serendipitous moments where somebody
could just say like have you seen this
new software that came out or this poker
course is really good or maybe this site

[19:16]
course is really good or maybe this site
this poker site is super soft you should
try putting some money on this site and
it'll keep you from you know just like
being too narrow focused and and just
doing the same thing over and over again

[19:30]
doing the same thing over and over again
yeah throughout all the politics that we
did networking always comes back and how
important is the peer group that you
have around you and for for multiple
reasons the ones that you just said it
included as well I was curious what you
said that you were playing a very hyper
exploitative strategy uh but there's

[19:47]
exploitative strategy uh but there's
also like a popular popular belief we're
saying that in order to exploit you
first need to know what is correct but
you actually mentioned that you didn't
know Theory at all so how did that kind
of then work because for example I would
say I was I guess everyone who succeeded

[20:03]
say I was I guess everyone who succeeded
resolver and was doing very well
intuitively had a good sense of how
like the concept behind the solver works
so even though we obviously there was
many things that I thought I was
exploiting that teleheighted was not

[20:16]
exploiting that teleheighted was not
exploited at all I was just exploiting
myself when Silvers came out
um but how then did you know that they
were making a mistake if we did not know
what was actually correct
okay so when I say that I didn't know

[20:30]
okay so when I say that I didn't know
Theory back then
um I did know fundamental concepts in
theory so things like pod odds which
lead to minimum defense frequency so how
much you need to defend versus a bet or

[20:46]
much you need to defend versus a bet or
a raise
and also optimal bluffing frequency So
based on your bet size again same as
minimum defense frequency how much you
need to be bluffing and how much you
need to be value betting also known as

[21:00]
need to be value betting also known as
valuable F ratio
those Concepts
like if you know those
that's often enough to be a very strong
exploitative player yeah if you put that
next to the data and say well this only

[21:15]
next to the data and say well this only
has to work 40 of the time but it's
working 50 of the time well do the math
yeah
so you can be a pretty strong
exploitative player just by
understanding those fundamental concepts
in theory but you you might also not

[21:30]
in theory but you you might also not
know for example like I didn't know how
to
really construct my check back range on
the turn after I see that the Flop you
know I just had no idea really how to do
that in a balanced way
um so I just didn't really focus on that
because I knew that that was a much

[21:46]
because I knew that that was a much
harder problem to solve and I just kind
of let that be because I was playing
Anonymous games and you know you can
literally just triple barrel
every single time that you don't have a
hand if you if you want to if people are
over folding yeah so you could say that

[22:00]
over folding yeah so you could say that
you are you're spending your energy on
the things that were actually making you
money the most
yeah and I guess that also simplifies
the or at least it helps with your
decision making process because you're
no longer confused it's quite simple
well I need to get to the river because
then they overfold then I just make this
bet and they overfold 15 so I make a lot

[22:17]
bet and they overfold 15 so I make a lot
of money and then which hand you would
put there which which properties your
check back which type of love you would
put there it doesn't really matter
yeah poker's just complicated enough
already you know even if you drastically

[22:30]
already you know even if you drastically
simplify things it's still you're still
going to have a lot of tough decisions
so
my focus at that point was um definitely
keep things as simple as possible focus
on the exploits that are making me the
money and just

[22:45]
money and just
basically get to the river where I knew
I had certain exploits mainly bluffing
too much because people were just
overfolding especially in 2019 more so
than they are now they still are but it
was you know every year they get a
little bit better defending I think and

[23:01]
little bit better defending I think and
so that was just kind of My overall
strategy yeah it is funny to see it I've
I probably started to work with data I
think in the same
2018-2019 I definitely had to spend a
lot more time I was mainly using folder
manager which is a little bit less user

[23:15]
manager which is a little bit less user
friendly so I wasted a lot of time but I
also at the moment I thought it gave me
I don't know I still have sometimes a
mix some things I prefer doing hold
marriage or something I prefer doing a
hand to note because all the manager
sometimes from a creative perspective
allows me a bit more flexibility on the

[23:31]
allows me a bit more flexibility on the
Fly that I kind of miss in hand to note
or at least the way I use and to note uh
sure there's a lot of room for
improvement there
um but yeah do you see that then if I
compare data from for example if I see a
presentation that I gave myself before
years ago or something and I see your

[23:45]
years ago or something and I see your
data and then I run the same data it's
like oh things are things are changing
quite drastically
compared to like the data for you how
the pool was playing four years ago to
how the pool is playing right now have
you have you seen the same observation
yeah but I I guess I think if it's sort

[24:02]
yeah but I I guess I think if it's sort
of like plate tectonics like the pools
are moving really they're just inching
along and they're progressing each year
a little bit so I I don't worry about it
too much because I know that like if I

[24:16]
too much because I know that like if I
really focus on improving I can improve
so much faster than the population can
improve as a whole but yeah that you
know the pools are definitely getting
better every year if you want to be
successful in this game you have to at

[24:30]
successful in this game you have to at
least
you know stay on that same rate of
improvement but I think it's actually
pretty easy to improve a lot faster than
they can if you put your mind to it what
do you think is a good example
top of Mind of
like something that used to be a huge

[24:45]
like something that used to be a huge
leak of population that
nowadays they're getting closer
to what is considered optimal and why do
you think they managed to close that
leak
I the first example that jumps to mind
is just defending versus small cbets

[25:01]
is just defending versus small cbets
like when a player's in the big blind
out of position in a single race pod I
think for many years
people would fold to the one-third
flopsy bet like up to 40 percent

[25:15]
flopsy bet like up to 40 percent
and the correct frequency is more like
33 or 34
um big binders button
so
I think that small C bet was something
that started getting utilized a lot more
right after solvers hit the market

[25:32]
right after solvers hit the market
people started using piyo and they
realized oh I'm just supposed to see
that range for small on these boards
then people started using it a lot more
and then when people encounter something
a lot more
then they start to get better at
defending against it

[25:46]
defending against it
yeah and I guess you also see it makes
sense right something works a lot so
everyone starts using it and therefore
you encounter more and therefore you
have to improve your defense versus the
new common strategies so to speak that's
kind of what happens I think what you

[26:00]
kind of what happens I think what you
also notice is
basically the earlier Street for example
defending verses of flopsy BET is
already easier to get closer to GGO
frequency than on a later streak because
you had to do some things right also on
the previous Street plus you have to do
the things right on the current street

[26:16]
the things right on the current street
so there's like a compound effect that
makes it a bit harder to defend have you
seen if you notice that as well
basically the earlier the street let's
say pre-flop even a pre-flop obviously
we can we can debate about
uh they're ready to treat the more
closer people are to Theory approved and

[26:31]
closer people are to Theory approved and
I guess with the years later streets
will follow to a certain degree
yeah I think that's generally true
although I will say that I think the
turn is a lot harder to play than people
give it credit for

[26:45]
give it credit for
I think the turn might be the hardest
Street to play in a lot of ways because
on the river a lot of you know a lot of
things collapse and are a lot more
static because there's no cards left to
deal but yeah I think in general the

[27:00]
deal but yeah I think in general the
more people see a spot in the more they
play it the probably the better they're
going to play it that's just sort of an
equilibrium that gets reached you know
if you if you have massive pre-flop
leaks you're you're probably not going
to make a lot of money uh playing poker

[27:15]
to make a lot of money uh playing poker
same with the flop
and yes I agree that if a mistake is
based on
you know a series of mistakes like if
you're if you're over folding the turn
too much because you check the Flop way
too weak uh versus certain but that is

[27:33]
too weak uh versus certain but that is
like twice as hard to fix because you
have to fix two mistakes instead of one
yeah you also have to identify what it
is because let's say for example you
overfold the river in a certain spot you
have to identify if it's well am I just

[27:46]
have to identify if it's well am I just
folding hands that are defense or am I
not arriving with the hands that it's
defending and therefore I always fold
right it's like two of the ways I think
also River as you mentioned I do agree
that
the harder I think you find playing the

[28:02]
the harder I think you find playing the
river
I think the more you also didn't think
about it on an earlier street so I would
usually say that a lot of the river
mistakes or tough spots that you might
find yourself in are kind of ass played
scenarios because for example you

[28:16]
scenarios because for example you
mentioned on the turn but maybe already
on the Flop you didn't look ahead and
you you didn't adjust for what's about
to come very likely in the future and
didn't adjust your frequencies or your
range construction accordingly

[28:30]
yeah I agree with that especially like
what comes to mind is bluffing so if you
get to the river and you don't know what
your River range is actually supposed to
look like in that spot
then how are you going to identify what
your weakest hands are to Bluff you

[28:45]
your weakest hands are to Bluff you
might have a weak hand but you don't
really know where that hand fits in your
overall range
so yeah I think that's true for sure
yeah also let's say for example you
arrive on a river with a bluff if you
don't have a good visualization of your

[29:00]
don't have a good visualization of your
overall range you might give up a River
Bluff in a spot where actually your
bluff allowance is so big that you could
basically Bluff everything and actually
you're giving up a bluff or vice versa
you're like well I have eight high or
well I have no Showdown value but it's a
spot where your bluff allowance with

[29:15]
spot where your bluff allowance with
maybe say only 50 and you're just always
bluffing you're easily over bluffing so
it's very very important to keep track
of
your range on every street and your
opponent's race as well to kind of know
how the strategies will look because in
the end yeah it's very range driven Adam

[29:31]
the end yeah it's very range driven Adam
I'm curious
it has some sitting goes in the time
that you were playing data was already
uh was already a thing did you did you
do any like population research on okay
what are the Tendencies of uh at
subsidian go players yeah there was lots

[29:47]
subsidian go players yeah there was lots
of database analysis we were using big
sample sizes on the player pool so
generally in heads of setting goals
you're either playing regs so you're
playing a quite GTO base strategy but
looking back in those days quite
laughable what we came up with is GTR

[30:00]
laughable what we came up with is GTR
and then you play a basically very
exploit strategy against the
recreationals and you had big data pools
we were using pt4 and hold a manager to
come with exploit strategies on the pool
but uh yeah obviously things have
evolved a lot now the software you have
behind to note and the kind of I

[30:15]
behind to note and the kind of I
database analysis you can do right now
is so much higher to uh you have to be
able to strategize better and create
those kind of exploits but yeah I think
data pool analysis and exporting the
pool is always such a big pot of Poker
and as far down we go over the solvers
like coming back to pool Tendencies I

[30:30]
like coming back to pool Tendencies I
know Patrick and your stable you've you
guys have really specialized in
understanding the data pools and
exploiting them so yeah I think it's a
really really big part of the pocket
that's not going to go away anytime soon
as I want to change the story a little
bit to a tough part in your book career

[30:45]
bit to a tough part in your book career
and I always over the Glamorous stuff
which is fun but you've had a downswing
around 2019 and you mentioned your
mindset was fried and you literally you
couldn't play anymore during this time
so I'm really curious to know what
unfolded during the end of 2019 and what

[31:00]
unfolded during the end of 2019 and what
were some of the challenges you were
experiencing that made you take a bit of
a break from poker at that time
well I I had a very quick rise up the
stakes
um like was mentioned before I started

[31:15]
um like was mentioned before I started
out playing 200 now and then got to 1K
and then 2K and L very quickly like
within six months and
I think I made about 50k at 2K now very
quickly
um her I just got lucky I mean the first
shot that I took

[31:31]
shot that I took
I think I made like almost 20 buy-ins at
2K in my first weekend playing at that
limit so pretty much couldn't have gone
better
except for the fact that I sold some
action and if I didn't do that then it
would have been even better
uh

[31:46]
uh
and then the downswing that I went on it
was not really that big of a downswing
in the grand scheme of things I mean
you guys have probably had guests on
this podcast who have lost the same
amount in a session but it ended up
being like about a fifty thousand dollar

[32:01]
being like about a fifty thousand dollar
downswing
and
not too bad because you know it was
right off the tail of a huge probably
100K upswing in the month or two before
and then I made about half of it back

[32:15]
and then I made about half of it back
immediately after the downswing and so
in terms of you know dollar amounts
nothing too heavy but you have to
remember that
I was not very far into my poker career

[32:30]
I was not very far into my poker career
at this point I was basically broke the
year before and then
for two years before that I was working
minimum wage in restaurants I was making
10 bucks an hour and so to lose 50k in a
month it was pretty crazy like couldn't

[32:46]
month it was pretty crazy like couldn't
really comprehend the the money at the
time
so I went on this
big downswing for me
and uh
I don't think that

[33:01]
I don't think that
that you know looking back that the
downswing was really what caused me to
burn out I think that that played a role
for sure if I just kept winning I
probably would not have
experienced this really difficult period

[33:16]
experienced this really difficult period
until later
um
but it accelerated it for sure I think
that the main problem was that I just
had no work-life balance at all and I
was completely isolated
so when I first started playing
full-time I was living with my brother

[33:31]
full-time I was living with my brother
Nick
we lived together for a few months and
then after that you know once I got to
Mid stakes and I had more money I moved
out and I started traveling around the
country and I would just get an Airbnb
for a month or two months in different

[33:46]
for a month or two months in different
cities and I was living in all these
different cities that uh I didn't know
anybody there
so
I had no life really I would just like
work out play poker and that was it and

[34:00]
work out play poker and that was it and
it was totally isolated and I wasn't
really dealing with any of the the
negative emotions that were coming up
through poker and I think that is what
really caught up to me is that I had all

[34:15]
really caught up to me is that I had all
of these kind of emotions that I was
just pushing down and uh it doesn't work
long term they always come back to get
you
and so uh after my downswing I made a
little bit of the money back I think I

[34:30]
little bit of the money back I think I
made about half of it back and then I
just continued to break even for another
month or two
again in the grand scheme of things not
even that bad in terms of variance like
I really wish I had somebody at that
point to sit me down and just like show

[34:45]
point to sit me down and just like show
me the math and show me that this
this downswing is nothing really in the
grand scheme of things that I think I
was just used to winning a little bit
too much and too quickly and it seemed
pretty severe to me but it actually
wasn't it's pretty normal variance and

[35:00]
wasn't it's pretty normal variance and
that's why I've written a lot of the
articles on variants that I have
you try to give people a better
understanding of what sort of downswings
and and Breakeven stretches that you
should expect
but at a certain point I just burnt out

[35:15]
but at a certain point I just burnt out
and I just couldn't play anymore it felt
like every time I would sit down to play
a session I would just have severe
anxiety and I had this feeling like
the total opposite of what I've been
feeling up to that point
the feeling that I was having now was
that I was expecting to lose

[35:31]
that I was expecting to lose
I was just expecting everything to go
badly even if a session started out
good if I like started out up two
buy-ins it was just like okay how am I
gonna lose this back I'm I'm probably
gonna end up break even or Worse on this

[35:45]
gonna end up break even or Worse on this
session let's see how it happens
and yeah so that was a really bad
mindset to be in I don't recommend that
anybody plays
poker when they're feeling like that so
I ended up just taking a big break which
I think
it is a really good solution sometimes

[36:01]
it is a really good solution sometimes
you just have to take a month or two off
from the game it can be just really
demanding on your mindset and sometimes
you just do really need a reset and so I
did that and I didn't actually end up
taking a complete break from poker but

[36:16]
taking a complete break from poker but
in that three month period I created the
Mobius poker Journal to to really just
like you know solidify my strategy and
to kind of remove all the
as much doubt from my thought process as

[36:30]
as much doubt from my thought process as
I could
and so that that did end up leading to
something really good because you know
we ended up using that as the the main
course for poker detox cfp later on
yeah so during this time we can see a

[36:45]
yeah so during this time we can see a
lot of factors compounding it's the
isolation it's the like a life balance
it's the maybe the short-term swings
where you've you've risk for the runs
quite quickly and you maybe not
experienced some of the financial swings
relative to the stakes that you've
played and then you've almost hit like a

[37:01]
played and then you've almost hit like a
moment where you're like right I need to
re-examine stuff so you've started
journaling what are some of the changes
you made to get yourself back on track
anything else that you did at that
moment in time
um so

[37:15]
um so
yeah it wasn't really
I I don't think that I I handled it uh
the best way that I could looking back
I think actually looking back I didn't
really handle it I distracted Myself by

[37:33]
really handle it I distracted Myself by
creating this poker course for a few
months and and really what I did was I
just continued to push
the emotions down
and that can work you know for short

[37:45]
and that can work you know for short
periods of time
um and then I ended up
sort of coming back to Poker
um mainly when the when Cove had hit and
it was like you just have to be playing
right now because the games were so good
but mostly I started focusing on

[38:00]
but mostly I started focusing on
coaching after that so it actually took
me a while before I felt comfortable at
the tables again and not anxious
um
so you know
I I think that I didn't really handle it

[38:17]
I I think that I didn't really handle it
very well
um and actually
about a year after that
late 2020. uh this was a difficult time
for a lot of people I think because of

[38:30]
for a lot of people I think because of
covet and lockdowns I had an even bigger
Rock Bottom so that was truly the like
the worst uh period from my mental
health
I've struggled a lot with depression in

[38:45]
I've struggled a lot with depression in
my life I've written about this a little
bit on my blog but I would like to
talk about it more in the future it's um
it's kind of a difficult thing to talk
about because usually when I write
things like on my blog

[39:01]
things like on my blog
I tend to write things that I feel like
I figured out
um and I've gotten through it and I want
to share with other people but with
depression I don't think you really ever
totally figure it out like you don't
actually know if you're out of the woods

[39:16]
actually know if you're out of the woods
it's just
sort of a journey that I've been on and
that I think I've made some good
progress with it and it's not really
about figuring it out or beating it it's
just about making progress

[39:30]
just about making progress
um and so
I became a lot more depressed in late
2020 and that's when I actually really
started taking my mental health a lot
more seriously and there were a bunch of
things that I

[39:45]
things that I
I did to help myself a lot with that and
I can go into those but I think the main
theme was that I actually started
processing emotions instead of just
pushing everything down
um yeah I think this is a great segue to
uh open up the conversation about mental

[40:02]
uh open up the conversation about mental
health in poker in general and using
your experience as a Gateway in there so
as you mentioned this kind of
suppression of emotion very common for
poker players to uh have very good
logical preformal codecs they'll
rationalize everything and they get good

[40:15]
rationalize everything and they get good
at pushing emotions down to some degree
as you mentioned when things were kind
of bubbling up you still distracted
yourself and when there's something else
cognitively I didn't deal with these
emotions I think a lot of poker players
can relate to this and not really
understand emotions and not allowing
themselves to deal with emotions and

[40:30]
themselves to deal with emotions and
express them and come to terms with them
so for yourself what were some of the
early signs that wait a second I need to
do some work here and what were some of
the um
practices or things you got to do to uh
gain more understanding of your mental
health during this time

[40:45]
yeah there definitely wasn't processing
things and it was kind of happening on
both fronts it's happening in life and
on the tables so if I would have a bad
session I would lose a lot of money and
feel bad about losing I wouldn't
actually sit there and

[41:01]
actually sit there and
you know feel those emotions I would
just try to push it down uh just ignore
it and distract myself with something
and the same thing would happen in life
like if I would feel bad about something
you know that was happening in my life I
would just try to distract myself from

[41:16]
would just try to distract myself from
it
uh I think probably a lot of poker
players deal with the same thing I mean
Poker is just really brutal on your
mental health for a lot of reasons so
even if you don't have like pre-existing

[41:31]
even if you don't have like pre-existing
conditions you probably
going to deal with this at some point if
you're a professional poker player
I remember just last year around this
time it was so weird like it seemed like
everybody that I was working with was
just really going through it all at the

[41:46]
just really going through it all at the
same time so I think this is like a very
common thing in poker for a lot of
reasons
um the thing that I started doing
in late 2020 after my like real mental

[42:01]
in late 2020 after my like real mental
health Rock Bottom uh well there were
three things basically and I just I I
got to a point with my depression where
I couldn't tell myself that I was
handling it well anymore like I couldn't

[42:16]
handling it well anymore like I couldn't
really
um make the case that I was able to
to deal with this on my own
it just got bad enough that I realized
that I needed to reach out to other

[42:30]
that I needed to reach out to other
people for help
and that was the big shift for me as I
stopped like keeping everything inside
and I actually started talking about it
so
um the first thing that I did was I I
started taking a medication

[42:46]
started taking a medication
I was on a medication for about a year
um I experimented with one drug which
was terrible for me and then I luckily
just found another drug which was like a
miracle drug for me and then that
really just like kind of reset my brain

[43:01]
really just like kind of reset my brain
it got me out of this sort of uh hole
that I was in and allowed me to sort of
reset
um
the other thing that I started doing was
I started going to therapy and started
talking about this the stuff a lot more

[43:15]
talking about this the stuff a lot more
with a therapist
and I did that Weekly for about two and
a half years I only recently stopped
going to therapy just because I felt
kind of good enough to stop and then
didn't just talk about it with

[43:30]
didn't just talk about it with
therapists but I also talked about it
with my close family and friends so I
kind of like stopped hiding my
depression from other people and that
really helped uh quite a lot as well

[43:45]
really helped uh quite a lot as well
yeah thanks for sharing that I know it
must have been very challenging to uh go
through something where you can't find
the answers and those poker players
we're used to uh trying to find that
definite solution in that right way and
quantifying stuff I know you've convert
quantifying background as well with

[44:00]
quantifying background as well with
emotions with feelings about mental
health sometimes it's like there's just
no empath or no clear Direction and we
just need to be vulnerable to open up to
share our experience to listen to people
to uh seek advice when we can as well so
it sounds like you were doing all that
which is definitely helped which is
which is great I'm interested to know

[44:16]
which is great I'm interested to know
you mentioned a lot of poker players
around you have been mental kind of
health problems at the same time and
that most poker players will have
challenges with it what are some of the
challenges about poker that makes mental
health a challenge for them and what can

[44:30]
health a challenge for them and what can
they do to start protect themselves
against some of the uh negative
consequences
poker is an incredibly isolating career
I I don't really know of too many other
jobs that are like this where

[44:46]
jobs that are like this where
I mean if you think about it you don't
have
a boss you don't have any co-workers
except maybe for the people that you
study with
um and you don't have customers
or employees and if you play online

[45:00]
or employees and if you play online
poker you don't even see the people that
you're playing with so it's really just
and if you wanted to I mean you could
just stay in your bedroom forever and go
out and get groceries and that's it just
play poker you don't have to talk to
anybody and I think some poker players

[45:15]
anybody and I think some poker players
actually do this
I think it's a good exercise to ask
yourself if you're an online poker
player why did you get into this
profession it maybe it wasn't a mistake
that you just chose
like one of the most isolating
professions you could possibly choose

[45:31]
professions you could possibly choose
maybe you actually kind of like uh being
isolated and avoiding people maybe it
feels a little bit safer for you but you
know we we know like it's a very
documented fact that isolation really
messes with people's heads

[45:47]
messes with people's heads
um if you take it to the extreme like
solitary confinement I think
you know it's one of the fastest ways to
to drive somebody kind of crazy so the
isolation is a a really difficult part I

[46:00]
isolation is a a really difficult part I
think also
you are kind of working the graveyard
shift
uh usually you're playing Knights you
kind of have to be working when other
people are playing like recreational
players are just playing poker for
enjoyment

[46:16]
enjoyment
um I think that can be hard on mental
health and then also just the financial
uncertainty so just the swings uh is
just really difficult to deal with too
so I mean I'm not a professional but I

[46:30]
so I mean I'm not a professional but I
I'm just kind of sharing what's worked
for me and uh you know certain
medications have worked for me in the
past
um and therapy as well just really like
figuring out how to talk about it and

[46:45]
figuring out how to talk about it and
actually process these emotions and open
up about them because I think that
depression is
it's sort of like a negative spiral
that's what I that's how I think about
depression
you often have a lot of this negative

[47:01]
you often have a lot of this negative
self-talk and negative thoughts and they
just are able to spiral inside your own
head and go unchallenged
and they just get kind of worse and
worse if you don't challenge them and so
anything that sort of breaks you out of

[47:15]
anything that sort of breaks you out of
that gets you talking to somebody else
maybe who can challenge those thoughts
that you're having or sometimes a drug
can do this where it just gives you a
different perspective on you know this
is not the only way that I can look at
my life there are other ways

[47:31]
my life there are other ways
um all of that is really good for just
breaking out of it
yeah I think the way you spoke about
that as well it's about breaking for the
narratives that you're trapped in in
your own minds and as you mentioned the
kind of factors of isolation often the

[47:45]
kind of factors of isolation often the
late night grinding and been on weird
routines dealing with extreme Financial
pressures and financial swings all these
things can compound to uh you've been
very trapped in your own frame of
reference and a lot of poker players who
went into the situation don't know where
to turn because you're already stuck in
your own head so as you've mentioned

[48:01]
your own head so as you've mentioned
whether it's a drug whether it's therapy
whether it's just speaking whether it's
a journal some form of getting out of
your own phone reference and getting
other perspectives in as well I always
think as well when you're stuck in your
own narrative very often just other
people to speak about your situation so

[48:16]
people to speak about your situation so
for you was anyone obviously you said
therapy was useful was there any of the
perspectives that were helpful for you
was there any forms of therapy that you
found useful or anywhere where you could
bring other perspectives into your
narrative that were helpful for you
during this time

[48:33]
um I sort of did kind of everything
um I just like threw everything at it
um so that was meditation it was therapy
um medication for a little while

[48:47]
um medication for a little while
and I think probably therapy was the
thing that helped me the most and my
therapist didn't really like assign
himself to any particular
type of therapy
um so I can't really give

[49:00]
um so I can't really give
you know a specific type of therapy that
worked for me uh there is a book that I
really like
um
and I'm I'm
it's called the courage to be disliked I
was blanking on the name for a second
there but it's um that book is more

[49:17]
there but it's um that book is more
based on adlerian psychology which I
think is really interesting it's kind of
a bit the opposite of Freudian
psychology so if you if you have read
about that and it didn't really resonate

[49:30]
about that and it didn't really resonate
with you that book
might uh be a better fit for you
I would recommend just like doing just
trying to do as much as you can so
that's for me that was living a healthy
lifestyle
I don't really drink or do any drugs

[49:47]
I don't really drink or do any drugs
um I work out a lot and meditate a lot
and also doing the therapy and
and then
I think the final step is to try to
build a stronger Community around you if

[50:01]
build a stronger Community around you if
you are dealing with a lot of this
isolation at some point you are just
going to have to go out and make more
friends
um so it's it's not like
I'm sure you you know this and it's not
like a quick fix it's just it has to be

[50:17]
like a quick fix it's just it has to be
if this is something that you deal with
a lot it has to be like a complete
lifestyle change unfortunately but it
can be for the best in the long term
yeah I think as you mentioned like
there's lots of small things you can do

[50:30]
there's lots of small things you can do
and often lifestyle factors play a big
role whether Sleep Quality Time Outdoors
exercise meditation social time with
friends all these things are lifestyle
changes you can make quite quickly to
see some sort of impact in your
physiology and physical States then

[50:46]
physiology and physical States then
there's going deeper into your into
therapy to understand the root causes of
emotional states it's create a peer
group around you so as you said there's
a lot of things to do and it's uh
ongoing work but it's as humans we are
quite complex for needs lots of moving
parts to function in our best I think
it's really good to bring this

[51:00]
it's really good to bring this
conversation forwards because I think a
lot of players listen to this might
relate to uh maybe going down a bit of a
slide where things their mood's change
and they're not experiencing as much joy
in public our own life I think that's
kind of the warning signs when yours
struggling to find enjoyment in other

[51:16]
struggling to find enjoyment in other
things as well as poker and I think you
end up numbing more and more of your
emotional responses and you struggle to
feel as much and this this can
definitely lead to a depressive state or
at least less of an enjoyment state so I
think it's hopefully please listen to
this will start exploring some Avenues

[51:31]
this will start exploring some Avenues
if they are experiencing that and as you
mentioned like it is just tough being a
poker player is challenging it comes
with unique things like the Isolation
part you can't really get around that
unless you live with lots of other
players even still you've got more
isolation than a normal job so yeah I

[51:45]
isolation than a normal job so yeah I
think it's bringing attention to it and
you need to make lots of changes for a
long period of time and the good news is
you feel better so for yourself I'm
curious to know as you've started to
make these changes how have you noticed
a shift in how you felt and how has that
impacted maybe your career and other
things you've been doing as well

[52:01]
things you've been doing as well
oh I mean well when I think about
how I feel now compared to two years ago
it's it's completely different
um I just feel
a lot lighter in general I would say

[52:17]
a lot lighter in general I would say
like I'm not carrying as much baggage
around with me day to day
um I do still obviously like there are
tougher days too where I'm not feeling
is happy and I I do still still deal

[52:31]
is happy and I I do still still deal
with depression and sometimes it's
harder because now when these negative
feelings come up I try to deal with them
immediately instead of just pushing them
back down so some days are really

[52:45]
back down so some days are really
challenging in the short term but in the
long term you just kind of
this compounds and you do start to feel
a lot lighter and it just
has sort of a synergistic effect on your

[53:00]
has sort of a synergistic effect on your
whole life where you know your mindset
is better
um you start sleeping better maybe you
start exercising more and then that
leads to even more energy and more
energy and it sort of like once you can
get the ball rolling it's easier to stay

[53:16]
get the ball rolling it's easier to stay
on track
how have you learned to deal with your
emotions as they come up you mentioned
you'll be more productive on dealing
with as they arise what are some of the
things you've had to do differently or
change in your approach to dealing with

[53:30]
change in your approach to dealing with
moment-to-moment emotions whether it's
frustration anxiety or even depression
uh just mindfulness I guess would be the
main thing so if I am feeling really
anxious about something I will Journal
about it or do a meditation or sometimes

[53:48]
about it or do a meditation or sometimes
I'll even video Journal so I'll just
turn my webcam on my computer like
if I you know can't talk to my therapist
in that moment I will just talk to my
webcam in a video journal and

[54:03]
webcam in a video journal and
um it's amazing how well that works
sometimes
um or talk to somebody else about it
you know I'll just say that if you're a
poker player who is going through

[54:15]
poker player who is going through
something like this and you open up to
even just another poker player in your
study group or something
I can almost guarantee you that you're
going to get it an extremely positive
response from that because you know in

[54:30]
response from that because you know in
general we like people are very
receptive when somebody opens up about
things like this especially now I think
the stigma is getting it's you know
getting a lot
uh better and people are not
stigmatizing depression as much but

[54:45]
stigmatizing depression as much but
poker players especially are probably
going through the same thing that you
are so
if you are able to just open up to
somebody even on Discord or something
just
I think you'll be really surprised
when you do start opening up about it

[55:03]
when you do start opening up about it
um
you're just gonna have this experience
of like why was I hiding this from
people there's no reason to be hiding
this
um and that's kind of how I look back

[55:15]
um and that's kind of how I look back
at my past self that didn't want to talk
about any of the stuff it just you know
it I don't really know why or how I
learned to hide it but it doesn't really
make a lot of sense like just because
you're depressed it doesn't make you

[55:32]
you're depressed it doesn't make you
any lesser of a person you know even if
you have serious depression like let's
say you're dealing with
um Suicidal Thoughts
if you open up about that I think you'll

[55:46]
if you open up about that I think you'll
realize like yes that does mean that you
do have pretty serious mental health
issues that you have to deal with but it
doesn't make you weird or crazy or any
lesser of a person like a lot of people

[56:01]
lesser of a person like a lot of people
deal with suicidal thoughts it's not
just you
and you know if you if you believe that
it's just you that that's just only
going to make it a lot worse
um so yeah well just the last thing I

[56:15]
um so yeah well just the last thing I
will sort of a caveat that I want to add
is that I'm
obviously not a professional about any
of this stuff like I'm just somebody
who's gone through it and every time I
write about this on my blog or Twitter I

[56:31]
write about this on my blog or Twitter I
always get like a lot of people dming me
and I'm always happy to respond to DMS
about this like my DMs are open
um but if you can
if you have the motivation to open up

[56:46]
if you have the motivation to open up
sometimes that that is like a small
window of opportunity
and so if you can I would suggest
reaching out to professional
um before you reach out to to just like

[57:01]
um before you reach out to to just like
dming me or something do whatever you're
comfortable with but if you can do it
there are a lot of resources
especially now like you can go on
betterhelp and that's a website that'll
hook you up with a therapist really

[57:15]
hook you up with a therapist really
quickly it's like not that hard at all
um there's another service that some of
my students have used it's called
healthy gamer I'm not sure uh how big
that that site is yet but I've heard
good things about it

[57:30]
good things about it
um so
I think doing that is the best place to
start because that will get you in touch
with a professional who's actually like
can really help you
um so yeah do that if you can but um you
know my DMs are open if people want to

[57:47]
know my DMs are open if people want to
discuss this stuff
thank you I'm sure people will
appreciate both of those options the DMS
and the region therapists as well and
yeah I think it's amazing how much share
in your experience with others helps I
think from both Avenues one not bottling

[58:01]
think from both Avenues one not bottling
up your own experience so you're going
through it alone but also there's
something about realizing other people
are going through similar experiences
myself I do group coaching and it's
always amazing when one player opens up
and shares something he's going through
that's four or five other players go up

[58:16]
that's four or five other players go up
yeah me too I'm also experiencing this
and they have this moment where it's a
realization going wow like I really
thought it was just me I thought I was
alone on this journey and you guys are
literally on the same problems I am and
as you mentioned obviously we're
individuals we have different states
different things we go through but we

[58:30]
different things we go through but we
share a very common experience of being
a poker player this very similar kind of
psychological stresses we're going
through similar challenges we're trying
to deal with it with certain mechanisms
I think when players start to share
their journey and what they're going
through with other players they quickly
realize they're not alone I think that's
also a big big help uh you mentioned as

[58:47]
also a big big help uh you mentioned as
well kind of hiding parts of yourself
elf there's some great work by Carl Jung
who's like an old psychologist and he's
got a theory called like the shadow Your
Shadow side which is a part of your side
you don't want to uh kind of acknowledge
and it's almost like the more you can

[59:00]
and it's almost like the more you can
hide the shuttle from the world the more
you create problems because this is
trying to the Shadow's always trying to
come to the surface and the more we have
parts of ourselves which we dislike
whether it's depression whether States
and we try to hide that the more this
kind of Shadow side becomes a problem
going forward so the integration of the
things you're going through as you

[59:15]
things you're going through as you
mentioned doing it with a therapist
would be the the best way to really
explore these things and go right what
is what am I trying to hold back how can
I bring this more to the friends and how
can I do some work to give myself cool
mechanisms to deal with this and as you
mentioned as well like it's not about
getting to a Finish Line it's more about

[59:30]
getting to a Finish Line it's more about
how do I live a good experience of Life
moving towards my goals and have
corporate strategies when things go
challenging for me how do I have some
things I can do to get myself back on
track to make myself feel good it
doesn't mean every day you feel amazing
there's ups and downs like all of us
every I think understanding yourself

[59:45]
every I think understanding yourself
better will give you some tools to do
that hi guys guys Renee aka the weko

and one-on-one coaching session in which
we are going to be reviewing if you have
been implementing the stuff that we
teach you in the mechanics of Poker
correctly so do you think you have what

[1:01:30]
correctly so do you think you have what
it takes to master the mechanics of
Poker go over to mechanics of poker.com
and maybe you will get a chance to work
with me and Adam and make more progress
in your poker career but for now without
further Ado let's get back into more

[1:01:45]
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode
so I'm going to transition a little bit
to
um
strategy versus mindset and I know you
do a lot of good work in this area so
I'm curious to know what your thoughts
are what are some things that come to
mind that are common licks you see in
players that they think are strategic

[1:02:01]
players that they think are strategic
leaks but they actually come from
mindset leaks
oh
um well I I think like the most common
leaks in poker in general are passive
leaks this is just really hard to play

[1:02:16]
leaks this is just really hard to play
as aggressively as a solver does
in most spots anyway
I think um
a lot of times people will
come up with

[1:02:30]
come up with
they'll become like a Nobel
prize-winning scientist about justifying
why they should fold in a certain spot
or coming up with all these reasons why
it's correct to not Bluff in a
particular spot
um

[1:02:45]
um
when you know they obviously don't do
the opposite they don't come up with
reasons like that for why they should
call or raise or or pull off in a
particular spot
and so that's something that I see
happen a lot I'm like doing a database

[1:03:00]
happen a lot I'm like doing a database
review with a player and showing him
that he's systematically under Bluffs
the river for example and then we'll
look at specific spots and I'll show him
you know this is not only is this a pure
Bluff in theory but I think uh the the

[1:03:17]
Bluff in theory but I think uh the the
data would show that people overfold in
the spot
and they'll be like yeah but I don't
like this texture I think uh you know he
he'll Chuck a lot of strong hands on
this turn and then on the river he's
gonna defend too much and blah blah blah

[1:03:31]
gonna defend too much and blah blah blah
blah so
that's kind of um
that's that's what I see happen often is
we have a cognitive bias
generally to play Risk averse and then
we make a lot of justifications in game

[1:03:46]
we make a lot of justifications in game
to you know allow ourselves to play more
passively because it's easier
um yeah I've noticed that very often as
well and I think it goes both ways you
can get the aggressive person as well

[1:04:00]
can get the aggressive person as well
who will justifies every Bluff justifies
always going out of stuff but as you
mentioned it's interesting because the
mind's still good at rationalize in that
these players come up with really
elaborate stories and they're also I'm
convincing if you didn't have the data
to kind of disprove them and it's almost
like there's your emotion takes
precedence you feel risk aversion in

[1:04:16]
precedence you feel risk aversion in
that moment so you'll be passive then
the main comes up with all these
gymnastic tricks to uh try to justify
and rationalize why you're doing this so
let's see this player that you've
mentioned let's say you've shown him
that he's being very passive and he's
got a tendency to be risk-averse you've

[1:04:30]
got a tendency to be risk-averse you've
shown the data and you go look at the
GTO would be bluffing more here and the
population overfolds how do you get this
person to first of all get on board with
the realization that they've got a
tendency here that's coming from a risk
aversion a mindset leak and then how do
you start working to eradicate that leak

[1:04:46]
you start working to eradicate that leak
in practice
you can't get somebody on board they
that's ultimately
as a coach there's like a limit to what
you can do so if somebody really has to
want to improve and hopefully if you

[1:05:03]
want to improve and hopefully if you
they're already sort of bought into your
coaching and if you show them enough
evidence they'll believe what you're
saying to be correct and they'll put a
little bit of faith in you
the way that I approach it is my

[1:05:16]
the way that I approach it is my
coaching is it's very heavy on database
reviews
so when I work with players we do a
database review every month
and if they're overfolding in a certain
spot I will check up with them on that

[1:05:30]
spot I will check up with them on that
frequency whether you know let's say
it's the
the riverfold frequency
if it's 58 and we need to get it to 48
every month we're checking that
frequency and if it's not at 48 then
we're looking at specific hands specific

[1:05:46]
we're looking at specific hands specific
examples of spots where they may have
overfolded
and so that accountability
and the concrete data of the stat check
I think are the two most important
things
but it really comes down to the student

[1:06:01]
but it really comes down to the student
in the end and I think that's a big
thing that separates the high performers
from the low performers
is that the you could tell a low
performer
that they have a leak
four months in a row and they might not

[1:06:15]
four months in a row and they might not
fix it
whereas some of the best players that I
work with they're just like obsessive
about plugging their leaks and if you
show them that they have a leak that
leak is not going to be around for very
long it might last two weeks and then
it's gone and they've plugged it

[1:06:32]
it's gone and they've plugged it
yeah as you mentioned you can only show
them what to do at some points uh but
yeah I think often when you're a student
and you're having coaching from someone
like yourself you're already bought into
your philosophy you're showing the data
which gives them that concrete evidence

[1:06:45]
which gives them that concrete evidence
of their strategy and then from there
you give them the guidance on how to
change it and then from there as you
said it comes down to the student to
change that you mentioned cognitive
biases as well which I think is very
fascinating error to explore what are
some of the kind of devices you've
explored or you've seen the pocket

[1:07:01]
explored or you've seen the pocket
players that again players think are
strategic leaks but are actually just a
bias that's leading them to debit their
strategy from in mindset leak
my favorite book is thinking fast and
slow by Daniel Kahneman I think that

[1:07:16]
slow by Daniel Kahneman I think that
book kind of shaped my career because it
it exposed me to all this whole world of
cognitive biases for the first time and
I just found it to be so interesting
that
we think that we're rational but humans
are not rational at all and in fact

[1:07:32]
are not rational at all and in fact
we are predictably irrational so our
intuition it's good for a lot of things
but it can reliably steer Us in the
wrong direction in certain areas

[1:07:45]
wrong direction in certain areas
and so you can never actually I don't
think you can ever totally overcome this
your cognitive biases are just built in
sort of to like the infrastructure of
your brain it's just how your brain
works
but you can understand them

[1:08:00]
but you can understand them
and get better at you know creating
systems to uh
mitigate you know the the consequences
of some of these cognitive biases
so risk aversion is I think the biggest
one that comes to mind that I just

[1:08:17]
one that comes to mind that I just
discussed another one is the loss
aversion
similar but it's essentially the idea
that your losses hurt more than your
wins
feel good so I think it's generally

[1:08:32]
feel good so I think it's generally
estimated that
um if you lose a dollar
for most people it's going to feel about
twice as painful as winning one dollar
would feel good so if you win a dollar

[1:08:45]
would feel good so if you win a dollar
and then you lose a dollar you end up
with this sort of emotional deficit
and one of my articles on my blog I
wrote about loss aversion I actually
Quantified this
and so the way that I did this was I
added up all the pots that I won

[1:09:01]
added up all the pots that I won
and all the pots that I lost over uh my
first year of playing poker so
in that year I made I don't know some
like 150 000 or something in that range
it ended up being that I my one pots

[1:09:18]
it ended up being that I my one pots
were
I think it was about 2.1 million
and then my lost pots were like 1.95
million
and so my winnings were five percent

[1:09:30]
and so my winnings were five percent
more
than my losses which is a big problem if
the loss is hurt twice as much as the
wins right and so that I think that
comes back to you know this is not
really like a technical thing but it
comes back to again the importance of

[1:09:45]
comes back to again the importance of
processing your losses
because they are going to hurt more than
your wins and even if you're a
profitable poker player it's going to
just be inherently
stressful when you just have to like
deal with the suckage of that cognitive
bias

[1:10:00]
bias
and if you don't process your losses
um if you just you know push down the
negative emotions instead of finding a
way to release them in a healthy way
that's just going to accumulate over
time and then I think you're you're sort

[1:10:16]
time and then I think you're you're sort
of inevitably heading towards a burnout
like the one that I experienced at the
end of 2019.
um yeah great book to read for anyone to
explore how the mind works and how we
think in two different systems and yeah
I think with biases it's one of those

[1:10:31]
I think with biases it's one of those
understanding is a big part of it just
realizing this the way the brain works
is going to lead to certain shortcuts
that lead to uh certain ways of thinking
like the risk aversion we're not going
to do much about that in terms of the
hardware but your understanding of how
it affects you can really help you going
forwards some of the ones I see very

[1:10:45]
forwards some of the ones I see very
often are confirmation bias where we'll
generally see a result and then we'll
confirm our action was good so let's say
you made a bluff on a river and evolves
you're like yes great player or if he
calls you're like I'm an idiot and you
use the one data point to uh confirm

[1:11:00]
use the one data point to uh confirm
whether it was a good decision rather
than using your overall strategy and
players for this all the time and
they'll they kind of use a very small
sample size to yeah confirm if they're
doing well their strategies went in even
if you look at results a lot of results
are confirmation bias you're having a
good week your graph's on a heater you
know yes I'm great at poker again using

[1:11:17]
know yes I'm great at poker again using
confirmation bias or if you're on a
downswing you get too attached to it
again understand that's how that works
is important since a projection bias is
another one I see players do this in
terms of this player should have done
this you project your strategy onto him
so you do a bet and your opponent should

[1:11:31]
so you do a bet and your opponent should
fold and he calls and then you start
going he's an idiot he shouldn't have
done that and you're projecting what you
should have done to him so yeah there's
lots of interesting errors here where
they seem like strategic leaks but in
reality it's the mind that's sort of
playing some tricks or doing some
shortcuts which leads to a division

[1:11:46]
shortcuts which leads to a division
strategy I think players exploring these
which ones myself been running going
back and forth on this in terms of
trying to understand a player's
strategically compared to his mindset
leaks and where's the kind of interplay
between the two
um actually it's good time to pass the
uranium what are some of the uh yeah

[1:12:00]
uranium what are some of the uh yeah
you've done a lot of things in this area
what are some of the biases you've
noticed that players think are strategic
where it's really disguised as something
different
yeah you see that I think most I mean
we've done a lot of work on that uh on
the river with like Bluff catching and

[1:12:16]
the river with like Bluff catching and
bluffing that's just naturally where I
think it most comes out and all the all
the things people invent the the very
classic
uh blocker Unblocker story I think
that's that's the best one that people
tell themselves whereas for people

[1:12:30]
tell themselves whereas for people
listening like in in solverland blockers
and on blockers they make they make the
difference between something being plus
v or minus V because you know the edges
that we're very close to equilibrium so
removing one card out of a range of 200
combos is gonna shift the strategy being

[1:12:47]
combos is gonna shift the strategy being
plus B minus V whereas in practice it
doesn't really work like that unless you
play in a four bat pot where let's say
there's only 30 combos in play Then sure
if you hold three if you hold a combo
that removes three combos that's a

[1:13:01]
that removes three combos that's a
significant impact but for the most part
let's say you play Blind first blind you
face a bad check bad thing like yeah I
wouldn't call I would only cover if I
had to repair with a club or with a
higher card lower card it's it's not

[1:13:15]
higher card lower card it's it's not
going to make a difference you're you're
you're finding an excuse to do what you
already wanted to do in the first place
which was to fold like uh Patrick also
mentioned that usually main population
Tendencies is under aggressing and
overfolding due to a natural risk

[1:13:31]
overfolding due to a natural risk
adversity
um so yeah that's I think the first
thing that comes to mind I mean we've
done a lot of work on that together as
well from both to to address both River
bluffing and Bluff catching from mental
game and Technical game I think it's a I

[1:13:45]
game and Technical game I think it's a I
think it's a very interesting topic for
sure
yeah there's so many biases and another
one that comes to mind based on the what
you just said is
uh
hypothesizing after the results are
known I call it the harking for short

[1:14:00]
known I call it the harking for short
that's this is something that I talk
about a lot with my students because
uh something that'll happen a lot if
you're studying with other players is
you'll be discussing a spot like is this
combo a good combo to Bluff with and
then you have a big discussion then you

[1:14:16]
then you have a big discussion then you
look at the solve and this the solver
says yes this is a good combo if you
have a club here you should bluff if you
if you don't have a club you shouldn't
Bluff sometimes that's obvious why it's
happening but a lot of times it's not

[1:14:31]
happening but a lot of times it's not
obvious at all and so
um often what will happen is people will
start hypothesizing about why that club
is so important
but it doesn't really matter because
you're doing this from the perspective

[1:14:45]
you're doing this from the perspective
of like knowing the answer already and
so
if you're just sort of guessing but why
this blocker is so important people will
spend 30 minutes on a call just talking
about this one spot and it's like this

[1:15:02]
about this one spot and it's like this
isn't really helping you because how are
you going to actually translate this
into something real when you're playing
and you don't have the solver telling
you what the right answer is
um
you know I think it's just it's best to

[1:15:17]
you know I think it's just it's best to
just focus on the really fundamental
properties of card removal and not worry
about
um the the really strange ones uh unless
you can really scientifically approach

[1:15:31]
you can really scientifically approach
it and figure out exactly
why these blocker effects are happening
it's usually better to just say look GTO
is impossible this probably isn't that
important of a thing and and just not
worry about it

[1:15:45]
worry about it
I think also another common one would be
to
especially you know because in in in
Sovereign a lot of things are going to
be a frequency and then they see oh yeah
you see at least 10 of the time when it
happens ten percent of the time and they
want it to happen they say well at least

[1:16:00]
want it to happen they say well at least
this happened 10 of the time and when
they don't want it to happen ten percent
of the time they say but it's only
happening 10 of the time it's the same
it's the same it's the same output but
they can use it or Justify their actions
they can interpret it in a different way
pick another one actually depending on

[1:16:15]
pick another one actually depending on
when this comes out we did a other
podcast uh
we we talked about this was actually PLO
player I'm hyping it now a little bit I
don't know if it already came out or not
depending on when we upload this uh but
he mentioned a lot that in PLO

[1:16:30]
he mentioned a lot that in PLO
specifically you have to re-evaluate the
strength of your hand on every street
because there's a lot of equity
switching going on on turn River because
you know you hold four cards instead of
two and in Holdem you can it's like a I
think they called like a hooking bias
you hook on the strength of your hand

[1:16:45]
you hook on the strength of your hand
and you and therefore you don't take in
consideration further new information
let's say you flop a set you're like oh
Flopper set gonna stack this guy but
then the board runs out very bad the
action is also very bad that makes your
hand I don't know
your hand relatively is no longer as

[1:17:01]
your hand relatively is no longer as
strong as it was on the Flop but you're
already hooked on the hand strength
you're already celebrating that you're
going to win a stack and now suddenly
the guy jams or re-raises you and you
have no longer you're already hooked on
on the fact that you're gonna stack off
and now you have no longer room for new
information to come in to realize that

[1:17:15]
information to come in to realize that
your hand is not actually just a fault I
think there's another very common bias
that that I see
um but yeah it I was listening silently
on the sideline when you guys were
talking about uh
the mental health issues I cannot say

[1:17:30]
the mental health issues I cannot say
that I've ever suffered from depression
but I have had my fair share of mental
health history mental health you could
say problems
um I think I I usually live with more as
mental game struggles and I feel like
and Adam you I'm gonna phrase it more as

[1:17:46]
and Adam you I'm gonna phrase it more as
a question as well I feel like some
players are just naturally sensitive to
mental game problems and other players
naturally are less sensitive to mental
game problems those didn't make sense
because it doesn't really seem like in
every state that I am in my life or in

[1:18:00]
every state that I am in my life or in
my career I seem to stumble up mental
game issues doesn't matter if I'm if I'm
at the top of my career bottom of a
career middle of a career playing on a
plane it doesn't matter there's always
something does that make sense am I just
sensitive to mental game [ __ ] no I think

[1:18:15]
sensitive to mental game [ __ ] no I think
you're right I think obviously humans
vary a lot and some people have just
better Frameworks of processed emotions
dealing with
um almost like something the interplay
between your emotions and your cognition
I think that's kind of the main skill to
uh have less mindset troubles and if you

[1:18:31]
uh have less mindset troubles and if you
have issues with mindset like like you
said it's it gets kind of pronounced in
certain areas so for you for example I'm
sure playing poker is probably the most
extreme mindset kind of issues to work
on but then it also shows up in other
areas where there's this kind of high
stress or Lots on the line but yeah I

[1:18:46]
stress or Lots on the line but yeah I
think obviously there's a lot of
variance between players I do think some
players are more vulnerable but overall
I do feel almost everyone needs to work
a mindset I say that very biased as
mindset coach but I do feel like there's
not many people who are just like right
from day one I've got a mindset bill for
pocket throw it at me I'm ready I can

[1:19:01]
pocket throw it at me I'm ready I can
take it all it's just such a challenging
occupation where you need to develop
tools and skills tests to deal with very
challenging situations whether it was
Patrick's example of losing 50k after
having zero money then losing large
amounts is that like I mentioned
relation they're dealing with the

[1:19:16]
relation they're dealing with the
unknown variables am I playing a good
strategy am I winning the challenging
competition day to day having to be on
top of your game see I think there's
just lots of things you have to learn to
develop on that journey and yeah maybe
some guys maybe I've not met these
people who are just really really just
made for it from day one but generally

[1:19:31]
made for it from day one but generally
You're Building skills and building
tools on the job and I think if you
approach poker in the right way
hopefully you'll come out of poker with
a much better mindset a much healthier
mindset yes disease kind of my mental
health issues that we need to address
with isolation and the unique fogger
problems the I think probably is a great

[1:19:46]
problems the I think probably is a great
landscape to actually explore your
mental health but also to a develop a
mental toolkit so would you say for
yourself or anyhow you've you've built
more the mental toolkits since playing
poker you say mine said stronger now
since then when you begun yeah for sure
but sometimes you get a bit tired of the

[1:20:00]
but sometimes you get a bit tired of the
fact that every time when you feel like
you feel like you know you arrive to a
new place where it's like now I got it
all figured out or you know it's like
it's like the illusion where it's all
now now I have it solved now I
understand the problem but then a new
problem arises or something similar or

[1:20:15]
problem arises or something similar or
you know you lose awareness a little bit
and suddenly the old problem comes from
behind and it detects you again it's
like oh I've I thought I dealt with you
already what what the hell are you doing
here again you know this is something
that that I experienced a lot like for
example throughout my career I suffered

[1:20:31]
example throughout my career I suffered
not as much anymore but still like I
said still things can come back
depending on the face that you're in but
I struggled a lot with recession anxiety
and I noticed that it had a lot to do
with the meaning that I gave to

[1:20:46]
with the meaning that I gave to
situation that I didn't know what to do
making mistakes losing I kind of gave
the meaning to that that me I was not
good enough to to to play or I would not
beat the games so imagine if any time
you go out to play and you find yourself

[1:21:01]
you go out to play and you find yourself
on a spot where you don't know what to
do or make a mistake AKA every [ __ ]
session you play or every you could even
say every 10 minutes that you play if
then I start to feel insecure
and that basically takes me out of the
flow and therefore at some points I had

[1:21:15]
flow and therefore at some points I had
to just stop my session early because
there was just too much insecurity yeah
that's a problem so when you go in
and I noticed like when I when I changed
my meaning to that when I realized that
like oh wait I'm afraid that I'll find
myself in a situation where I don't know
what to do well guess what that's going
to happen and I changed my meaning to

[1:21:30]
to happen and I changed my meaning to
that that kind of started to lose its
its power so
that's when like precession anxiety for
me started to lose also I think the
meaning that you give to losing or how
important winning is I think better can

[1:21:45]
important winning is I think better can
probably relate to this I've also a
coach of students and all the students
that performed badly were all guys who
are on the financial pressure this was
this is for my for me it's the best
indicator of someone not going to
succeed when they're under Financial
pressure because then losing hurts too

[1:22:01]
pressure because then losing hurts too
much they're too emotionally involved
they're afraid to lose and then it
becomes sort of a self-offending
prophecy as Patrick also said good good
winning poker is usually aggressive
poker full class
go all in a lot right it's exactly what

[1:22:15]
go all in a lot right it's exactly what
you mean let's say for example you're in
a spot where you just shove your stack
in it usually happens like three weapons
four weapons big pots where the SP are
small your bet maybe only has to work
35 40 of the time which means the
majority of the time you're gonna shove
your stacking you're gonna get called
and you lose your stack it feel it feels

[1:22:31]
and you lose your stack it feel it feels
it doesn't feel like winning right
because the the exactly what you said
the hurt the losses hurt more than the
winnings so it takes it takes a
different type of mindset and if
you have that attachment towards losing

[1:22:45]
you have that attachment towards losing
then you're gonna try to prevent losing
which actually makes losing yourself
offending prophecy because you're going
to play more passive poker and Miss up
on very good plus v spots lowering you
remember it making losing actually
more likely so it's the mind is an

[1:23:00]
more likely so it's the mind is an
interesting it's an interesting thing
and often uh
and often a trap I I also what you
mentioned about the emotion actually
Adam recommended me a very good book
that I will now recommend as well
um
the Hawkins guys surrender letting go

[1:23:16]
the Hawkins guys surrender letting go
what was the name of the book again let
it go Letting Go by David Hawkins very
very excellent book in my opinion I
helped me personally a lot and I was
also started to I got pointed out on a
certain Loop that I was in let's say for

[1:23:30]
certain Loop that I was in let's say for
example I play a session and I made a
lot of mistakes or I lost I felt bad
okay which is quite normal
especially for me when I didn't feel
uncertainty like I said if there's a lot
of spots that I feel like I'm a bit lost
I don't know what to do it certainly

[1:23:46]
I don't know what to do it certainly
comes off and I don't like the feeling
of uncertainty so then what I do I go in
massive strategy development right I dig
in maybe you can relate to this
especially when it comes down to data
data offers certainty in a very
uncertain world and I don't like the

[1:24:01]
uncertain world and I don't like the
feeling of uncertainty so what do you do
you look up the data to get certainty
which on one side I think has helped me
a lot of my career because therefore
I've spent a lot of time studying I've
spent a lot of time for example
preparing me every day before I would
jump into a game

[1:24:16]
jump into a game
nowadays a bit less than in the past so
like I said it has his ups and downs but
especially in the past because of his
anxiety I was over prepared every time I
played and guess what I knew everything
or at least I knew a lot of everyone so
I was never caught off guard I was never

[1:24:31]
I was never caught off guard I was never
not on a on my a game so that had the
benefit however obviously if you want to
be in your A game all the time
you cannot really play a lot of volume
if you need a game to play so that was
kind of a problem and the problem is for

[1:24:46]
kind of a problem and the problem is for
example I couldn't continue playing
because if uncertainty build it up to a
certain place I had to resolve that and
I had to resolve that wit strategy and I
and I in your story this big downswing
that you then I think made the Mobius
Journey you said it sounded very similar

[1:25:01]
Journey you said it sounded very similar
to something that I would do things go
bad I locked myself into a room I go
over every spot write out my strategy
again so I have Clarity I have certainty
and then but basically I just need to do
that for two weeks so I have so my
certainty is at a level that I can

[1:25:15]
certainty is at a level that I can
basically play again which I realize at
some point is a problem so nowadays what
I will do way more if I lose I'll be
like
okay just just sit sit with the emotion
of losing how does it feel and really
and really try to process it afterwards
I could still analyze but I'm not

[1:25:31]
I could still analyze but I'm not
analyzing anymore to remove the emotion
I'm analyzing actually because I think
it's a good idea to analyze and notice
the same I was always very proud of not
checking my results and I always felt
like yeah that's that's a smart thing to
do right but then I also noticed it was

[1:25:45]
do right but then I also noticed it was
just avoidance I didn't want to see that
I lost because it would hurt too much
and I realized that oh later that was
always saying with bright oh I haven't
looked at my result in one month you
know I'm so process oriented let's
[ __ ] I was just avoiding the
possible feeling of losing and basically

[1:26:00]
possible feeling of losing and basically
if you just look only at your results
every three months the chance of you
losing is is quite small so like it had
benefits but it also had downsides
because
if I really needed to be on my A-game to
perform let's say for example I only
slept for I slept bad I would just not

[1:26:15]
slept for I slept bad I would just not
play a whole day that's obviously a
problem right so I feel like now
both internally like you can solve these
things both internally and externally
I've done work on both uh I don't know
like when I when I talked about the data
do you do you can you relate with that

[1:26:32]
do you do you can you relate with that
that data offers like a certain amount
of certainty which removes the
uncertainty so we're not dealing with
the uncertainty we just inject more
certainty
yeah I've never really thought about it
like that

[1:26:46]
like that
um
but it does make a lot of sense I I tend
to feel like I prefer studying over
playing just because
it gives me an opportunity to build
something and discover things and I can

[1:27:00]
something and discover things and I can
actually build a body of work like a
course some sort of curriculum that I
can look back on whereas playing is more
just like executing a strategy that I've
already
you know determined that I'm going to do
and all I have to look back on after I
play is like obviously money that's good

[1:27:17]
play is like obviously money that's good
and a graph but that doesn't really
matter very much to me like the graph it
doesn't do a lot for me I know certain
players that just absolutely love
looking back at their graph after a year
of crushing volume and and that gives

[1:27:30]
of crushing volume and and that gives
them a lot of pleasure it doesn't for me
but I do resonate a lot with what you
said about
um tying yourself Worth to your results
and how that can really lead to a lot of
performance anxiety
the amount that you

[1:27:47]
the amount that you
tie yourself worth to you know how good
of a poker player you are is
proportional to how much stress you're
going to experience when you lose
so

[1:28:00]
so
I I think
it's very good to recognize that and
that has helped me a lot with my
performance anxiety too is just really
establishing that this one session
whatever the results are it doesn't make
me any better or worse of a poker player

[1:28:15]
me any better or worse of a poker player
even though my monkey brain really wants
to say that a winning day is a good day
and a losing day is a bad day
and understanding of variance can help
with this a lot too is just really
establishing in your brain that whatever
the results of this session are it's

[1:28:31]
the results of this session are it's
basically just noise you've got maybe a
55 chance of winning in a 45 chance of
losing and so it doesn't really make any
sense to tie yourself Worth to that in
fact it's actually very stressful and

[1:28:45]
fact it's actually very stressful and
unproductive to do that
I will say that the sort of doubt and
the stress can be productive like you
said it seems like you understand that
this is a motivating factor for you to
improve
and so what is the alternative like you

[1:29:01]
and so what is the alternative like you
know if obviously it sucks that this is
the way our brains work that we have to
feel these negative emotions in order to
stimulate growth
but if the alternative is just that you
never doubt yourself or any plays that

[1:29:15]
never doubt yourself or any plays that
you make and you just like basically
stagnate and never get any better that's
not good either so I think a lot of
players exist on this spectrum I've got
some players who who are my students who
they can just Crush volume
but they also don't seem to have as much

[1:29:31]
but they also don't seem to have as much
attention to detail
and they're not really as good at fixing
leaks typically as the people on the
other end of the spectrum who don't play
as much volume but focus on studying a

[1:29:45]
as much volume but focus on studying a
lot and they have a much stronger
attention to detail and they're always
questioning
their actions so I think
there's a sweet spot and if you're if
you're on either end of the spectrum too
much I think you should do some work to
get closer to the middle

[1:30:01]
get closer to the middle
I definitely feel like
when I for example I I studied a lot in
poker in in massive B for I think about
two years after that when I started to
play
because I became so conscious of all the

[1:30:17]
because I became so conscious of all the
possibilities and that the correct quote
answer was really dependent on either
this either that I remember when I would
play it was so overwhelming in terms of
well I see this spot well I can do this

[1:30:30]
well I see this spot well I can do this
I can do that well that the this would
be the best play depending on this I
basically I sort of it sounds a bit
weird but I sort of Knew Too Much and
therefore I knew actually nothing in
terms of I couldn't perform because I
was just
way too much stuff going on inside my

[1:30:45]
way too much stuff going on inside my
head so certain also accepting and and
we actually get I want to actually talk
about this topic in in a second like
defining what your strategy is and sort
of
deciding on one route that you're going
to take instead of being in a situation
well yeah well there's various routes

[1:31:01]
well yeah well there's various routes
that I can take like
off off game work I think it has
definitely benefits because you're very
open-minded and you can look at various
possibilities so you will see lines or
strategies that other person might not
see but if you don't decide before you

[1:31:16]
see but if you don't decide before you
play what your exercise is going to be
it can bite you in the ass when you
start playing I think also what you
meant is interesting like players who
have more eye for detail
let's say for example you play a session

[1:31:31]
let's say for example you play a session
of two hours you have two of your
students one both that you just
described one guy might have identified
five mistakes or
yeah one of identify five mistakes where
the other one who has more attention to
detail might have identified 15 and

[1:31:45]
detail might have identified 15 and
maybe after two hours he's like well
I've identified 15 mistakes I want to
quit my session I want to look at those
mistakes but other guys just like well
I've only made five mistakes and they
were not so big so he can just basically
continue playing
do you feel like that's something that
could be going on

[1:32:00]
could be going on
yeah
and honestly I think probably the people
who are easier on themselves have
better chances of being successful in
poker because a lot of the success in
poker just comes from longevity

[1:32:17]
poker just comes from longevity
and as long as there are recreationals
in your game you're gonna be profitable
in that game like like you said you know
you feel self-conscious about playing if
you didn't sleep well the night before
um probably that doesn't have as big of

[1:32:30]
um probably that doesn't have as big of
an impact if you're sitting at a table
with one recreational player you're
probably gonna be profitable in that
game I don't think I don't know what
your your win rate is Renee but I don't
if let's say it's like seven big blinds
per 100 or eight big points per 100 I

[1:32:45]
per 100 or eight big points per 100 I
don't think it's gonna go negative uh
down to three negative three big blinds
per hundred just because you didn't
sleep well that night it smells like it
sounds like exactly what Jared tender
told me back then he says no you have to
implement he said you see things too
black as white you either say that
you're a Crusher or a losing player

[1:33:01]
you're a Crusher or a losing player
there's something in the middle as well
you told me
yeah but the interesting point he also
said
he said so you're saying that because
you slept bad that you're not going to
perform well but every time you sleep
that you don't play how do you know that

[1:33:16]
that you don't play how do you know that
you're gonna perform bad if you never
play when you when you don't sleep and I
was like ah good point so I remember
it was the same for example let's say
you take a holiday break
and afterwards you come back
I would need like a week at least to

[1:33:30]
I would need like a week at least to
feel
like a week of sort of preparation to
feel like okay I can I can perform again
right and again he said the same thing
is how do you know he actually said and
this is actually good advice for people
listening as well when you come back for
your holidays actually the perfect time
to just jump in

[1:33:45]
to just jump in
and see what your C game looks like
because they will point you out exactly
the most uh important areas for your
game to improve so I made a very big
mind shift both in the sleep at some
point and also with the brakes I will
jump in aligning expectations majorly

[1:34:00]
jump in aligning expectations majorly
important because if you expect to play
your A-game guess what you're going to
get frustrated because most likely
you're not whereas if you expect to play
your C game you actually might be
surprised that you might actually start
playing your A-game it's your
expectation going in will really
determine how how your session is going

[1:34:16]
determine how how your session is going
to be if you're going to say listen I'm
going to be very Rusty I expect the
minimum and the minimum comes up is like
wow that was expected if you perform a
little bit better than the minimum
you're like oh it's pleasantly surprised
with how things went today uh so I think
aligning expectations is very important

[1:34:32]
aligning expectations is very important
and another thing that I think is very
important that helped me a lot was
instead of tracking outcome like you
said obviously detaching yourself worth
from the results very important which
actually also maybe you can also relate
to this I usually access LSS coaches

[1:34:47]
to this I usually access LSS coaches
especially when I start to get coaching
and start to go a bit more in the public
I suddenly this is why I said Mexican
perms somehow they always chase me every
time my situation change a new problem
comes up it's very annoying but
so I started to put myself out there

[1:35:01]
so I started to put myself out there
just like you right as a coach and then
suddenly I started to notice that if I
would be on a downswing it would
suddenly influence me way more because I
felt like I needed to win
to have credibility and that kind of
became like a self-fulfilling prophecy

[1:35:15]
became like a self-fulfilling prophecy
because like oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] I haven't
been winning over the last 20K hands 40K
hands whatever I'm not running so well
and then I wanted I started to play and
I wanted to win because the winning was
tied to sort of my credibility as a
coach so then what happens well your

[1:35:31]
coach so then what happens well your
your performance pressure increases
right your performance anxiety before
you jump in your session increases and
then it becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy because you're gonna choke
because the winning becomes too
important to you so as you can see meant
the game it's annoying thing uh but what

[1:35:46]
the game it's annoying thing uh but what
I wanted to say and now I hand it over
to you so instead of tracking your
results but like I said I found this
more easily when it was just me because
the outer world if I show a graph where
I'm break even in 100 hands everyone is
going to be like and if I say variance

[1:36:01]
going to be like and if I say variance
then everyone's good guy you just suck
blah blah how can you coach or at least
that's a story that you tell in your
head
obviously the reality is is way
different but to instead of results
track like certain kpis like you already
mentioned right I do exactly the same I

[1:36:15]
mentioned right I do exactly the same I
look at my game I identify certain leaks
I'll write like stat calls I usually
like to give like brown silver gold so
let's say my River fold is 55 I want to
get it to 50. I write down okay it's now
55 the aim is 50 that's the gold aim oh

[1:36:32]
55 the aim is 50 that's the gold aim oh
I'll give 51 for silver and 52 for
bronze or something I'll do that for all
the stats and then after my session I'll
load in a filter face riverbed so after
my session oh look at these hands
because like you're gonna look at River

[1:36:46]
because like you're gonna look at River
fold after your session because there's
let's say you played a thousand hands
River fold says nothing so after the
session I'll look at the actual hands to
see if I'm applying it correctly and
then after the month I will look at my
actual stats and that way if you have
certain

[1:37:00]
certain
Focus point for your session and after
your session is done you just evaluate
your session or how your session went
based on did I do what I set out to do
did I focus on my focus points if the
answer is yes then who cares about the
short-term result of the session but you
need to track something I feel like if

[1:37:15]
need to track something I feel like if
you don't track kpis or you don't look
at your results
yeah you're going to want to see
something right
and then most people grab for the grab
for the graph and then basically you're
putting how you've done you're putting
in the hands of the poker gods in the

[1:37:30]
in the hands of the poker gods in the
short-term variants that seems like a
problem
yeah that's a really good point and uh
one other mindset shift that I've used
for people who like
dwell on their mistakes way too much

[1:37:45]
dwell on their mistakes way too much
um I think it's common like let's say
you sit down for a session and you get
stacked really early in the session and
let's say you made it you actually did
make a big mistake and you got stacked
and you you say okay that

[1:38:00]
and you you say okay that
mistake was let's say it was a blunder
like 10 big blinds
and I think I think it's common if your
win rate is four big Blends per hundred
uh people will think oh well I just

[1:38:15]
uh people will think oh well I just
wiped out
my win rate for the next 250 hands just
with that one mistake so now I just I
have to play another 250 hands just to
get even in expected value before it can
start making money that's not actually
how it works your win rate

[1:38:30]
how it works your win rate
your your mistakes that you have made
historically are built into your win
rate already
so if your win rate is four
that is the sum of all of the good plays
you've made and the bad plays that
you've made so I think it's a lot more

[1:38:45]
you've made so I think it's a lot more
productive to go into your session
understanding that nobody plays
perfectly and that you are going to make
a lot of mistakes and that you have made
mistakes in the past so you're going to
continue probably to make mistakes the
only thing that you can really try to do

[1:39:00]
only thing that you can really try to do
is just make smaller mistakes and fewer
mistakes in the future
um but you're you're always going to
make mistakes and the fact that you make
a mistake in a session is not going to
be the thing that turns you from a
winning player into a losing player and

[1:39:17]
winning player into a losing player and
the absolute worst thing that can happen
for Ev if you're a winning player is
that you get knocked out of the game
completely because of these mindset
leaks like you burn out and you just
stop playing well now your EV just went

[1:39:30]
stop playing well now your EV just went
from eight big blends to zero and that's
actually the worst thing that can happen
the odds that you're going to be losing
in games unless you have really poor
game selection are very very low
maybe you'll go from eight to five or

[1:39:47]
maybe you'll go from eight to five or
six if you're playing on a bad day or at
a time where you don't really feel like
you should you can be playing your A
game
um but yeah longevity is just is super
important and the ability to just put in
that volume because the fact is there

[1:40:02]
that volume because the fact is there
are recreationals playing and there's a
lot of free money floating around and
you a major part of your job as a poker
player is to just be there
to to get that money that free money
when it's there just show up and to not

[1:40:17]
when it's there just show up and to not
go crazy in the process
yeah and especially what you said and
empathy again is very important here
right and then aligning expectations not
so that you sit you lose three points

[1:40:30]
so that you sit you lose three points
you're like what the [ __ ] is going on no
this is this is something that I
constantly do before I start playing I
align expectations what can happen I can
sit down and lose three binds this can
happen right whereas if you don't expect
that because you are not conscious about
it and you just expect to be a winner
you might get thrown off by like what

[1:40:46]
you might get thrown off by like what
the [ __ ] three buy-ins what's happening
but if you just align expectations and
have empathy towards yourself especially
when certain things are mistakes like ah
not great but can happen I'll look at it
afterwards that's I think another very
important one if you use a Tracker you

[1:41:01]
important one if you use a Tracker you
can Mark hands
I read in my very first year in cfp I
wrote I made like a little book an
actual book that I gave to my students
and it was pre-session post session and
basically there were just some basic
questions of like well what are my focus

[1:41:16]
questions of like well what are my focus
points how to do my focus Point uh like
a little performance was first like 2019
I think this was and within after every
five sessions or so so every every
session was one page I put it like a
little a motivational quote or put it

[1:41:32]
little a motivational quote or put it
like some advice and one of them was
mental mental flushing I think I got it
that when you play a hand the act of
actually marking it
to associate that but like listen it's
marked and now it's gone because so you
don't ruminate over hands anymore I know

[1:41:45]
don't ruminate over hands anymore I know
this for myself this is very useful as
soon as I know that I mark it and after
myself I'm gonna look at it I can let it
go
because it's very
uh very bad
or not optimal that if you're playing a
poker hand let's say 100 brain capacity

[1:42:00]
poker hand let's say 100 brain capacity
for a poker hand if 50 is still thinking
about the last hand that you play that's
a problem right because then you only
have 50 left for the current hand so I
think that's uh that's definitely
something that uh players can use for
another I remember that I don't know if
you listen to the podcast that we did

[1:42:15]
you listen to the podcast that we did
with I think it was sunny he said if I
go into session
and Australia will lose three buy-ins
there's a certain element of except
accepting here he said it's very
unlikely that I will win this session
let's say I start the session down 20K
if I can end this session down minus 5K

[1:42:31]
if I can end this session down minus 5K
that's a huge win
that I thought it was a very interesting
mindset shift as well like he already
accepted like listen winning this
session I mean would be great but it's
unlikely to happen but if I can only
lose 10 today that's that's amazing it's

[1:42:45]
lose 10 today that's that's amazing it's
amazing this is a completely different
different mindset uh definitely for
people I thought the sunny podcast uh
very good if you want to hear someone
who who figured it out mindset wise
yeah it makes me think of something that
I used to do which was maybe

[1:43:02]
I used to do which was maybe
probably more extreme than that even
which is that I learned this from Andrew
Graham oh hey Cindy on Poker Stars
people might remember that name I
remember we lived together and yeah in

[1:43:15]
remember we lived together and yeah in
uh 2020
I had the pleasure of living with him
and we were both grinding uh Bovada side
by side
and kind of dealing with the swings
together and we made up this game
and this game works especially well in

[1:43:32]
and this game works especially well in
Anonymous games because you can really
turn up the aggression and people won't
be able to exploit you but if we would
get stuck early in a session we would
play the game let's see how much I can
lose in this session so we would start

[1:43:45]
lose in this session so we would start
like I would start taking every single
spot I would just you know if
if I was gonna Bluff maybe 70 pot I
would go for a 2X over bed you know as
long as it made sense and you know you
have some flexibility in in poker to to

[1:44:02]
have some flexibility in in poker to to
take a more aggressive spot or to take a
less aggressive spot a lot of times it
doesn't really matter you know in in
Eevee
so you know maybe I can Barrel the turn
with his hand half the time and check
half the time I'm going 100 and just

[1:44:17]
half the time I'm going 100 and just
choosing the biggest sizes and making
the biggest pots
and kind of a
degenerate uh
strategy for sure like I get it right
it's like listen we're gonna lose anyway
who cares we're either gonna lose big or

[1:44:32]
who cares we're either gonna lose big or
we're gonna make it back
that's kind of the mentality it was just
yeah I think it was just sort of a way
of just laughing
in the face of variants instead of being
really scared of it like there's another
attitude you could take which is like oh

[1:44:46]
attitude you could take which is like oh
God I'm down five buy-ins you know how
am I gonna recover from this well this
game was more it's just like saying well
[ __ ] this like I don't give a [ __ ] about
the five plants again I'll lose 15
buy-ins you know I don't I don't give a
[ __ ] and

[1:45:01]
[ __ ] and
um and you know like usually we don't
play aggressively enough to begin with
so if anything I was just kind of
helping our game and not hurting it I
would say for me it's probably that's
probably a good game to play because if
I go on a downswing
I probably Reverb more to passive play

[1:45:16]
I probably Reverb more to passive play
so I would have to consciously up the
aggression way more like I said I will
find excuses why I should give up this
hand or that that's that's my classic
tilt uh passive tilt that that's my
classic league so for me actually this

[1:45:30]
classic league so for me actually this
game would be
would be very good I would say
just don't come back to me uh yeah okay
no no no no no no it didn't work money
back guaranteed with Patrick Howard here
right all right all right noted uh I was

[1:45:47]
right all right all right noted uh I was
I was curious to move on move on in the
conversation you play you've spent I
think like 80 of your time coaching
what made you decide to

[1:46:00]
what made you decide to
Focus full time on coaching instead of
also playing
it was just a natural thing for me uh
like I said right from the beginning
when I got back into poker I started
working on coaching uh for my brother

[1:46:16]
working on coaching uh for my brother
and so I think it's just that's the way
that I learn and then also like I said
before
it gives me a lot more satisfaction to
feel like I'm building something and
researching and discovering new things

[1:46:30]
researching and discovering new things
uh because when I play I just sort of
play a strict strategy and I don't
really feel like I learn very much
through playing sometimes I'll make a
connection and I'll get an idea like oh
I want to go study this more uh

[1:46:46]
I want to go study this more uh
and I do sometimes play creatively but
it's it's not it's not usually the kind
of thing that I feel like can translate
into
um a strategy that I can reproduce and
use in the future for that I really need

[1:47:00]
use in the future for that I really need
to just step away from the tables and
and do real work in the solve or enhance
a note
so yeah I just get a lot more
satisfaction out of that and I think
coaching is better for me for that
reason there was a time when I was sort

[1:47:16]
reason there was a time when I was sort
of self-conscious about this I would get
really self-conscious that I didn't want
to play poker because when you're a
poker coach
um you know a lot of people just hate
poker coaches on the internet there's a
lot of trolls coaches

[1:47:31]
lot of trolls coaches
yeah
um I think you know it's it's pretty
Stan it's pretty natural that you've got
this cohort of people in the community
that are making the games a lot tougher
and uh I think that's one of the reasons

[1:47:45]
and uh I think that's one of the reasons
why some people just hate the poker
coaches uh because they're just making
the game stuffer
um it also you know people who don't
want to invest in themselves and get
better at poker will probably naturally
dislike poker coaches

[1:48:02]
dislike poker coaches
and so one of the things you get a lot
as a poker coach is oh you don't play
poker you know you probably can't even
make money playing poker
um even though I I personally proved

[1:48:15]
um even though I I personally proved
that I can definitely make money playing
poker even at high stakes you know you
still get that and if you're not playing
very much you're not going to be as
sharp like I will be the first to admit
I'm not as sharp as some of my students

[1:48:31]
I'm not as sharp as some of my students
or probably most of my students
um who are playing full-time
there's a difference between being a
talented poker player and being sharp
um you know and you can go through

[1:48:45]
um you know and you can go through
phases where you're sharp at sometimes
and you're not sharp at other times when
you're focusing more on the coaching
um I forgot what your initial question
was but but yeah it's just like you only
have a certain amount of hours in the

[1:49:00]
have a certain amount of hours in the
day right so it's not feasible to expect
yourself to have a coaching business
that you might work on six or eight
hours in a day and then to go play a
four hour poker session after that you
just there has to be a trade-off

[1:49:16]
just there has to be a trade-off
um at a high level yeah I I like
coaching definitely
um
more than playing and then the discovery
part of coaching the actual strategy
building is the thing that I like the
most

[1:49:30]
especially at the the start of your
career you were very big on studying
population Tendencies through MDA in
European what are the main benefits for
people to study their population
tendencies

[1:49:46]
the main benefits are
well it's a direct way of learning
exploits
and I say that because
now I focus almost all my time on Theory

[1:50:04]
now I focus almost all my time on Theory
most of my time is spent developing
simplified GTO strategies
and
I feel like I
probably the reason that I started with

[1:50:18]
probably the reason that I started with
the population stuff is just because
that's what
the community that I was in was doing
when I started playing poker I joined
poker detox and my brother Nick was like
really all in on the population exploits

[1:50:31]
really all in on the population exploits
at that time
and it was really effective especially
in Anonymous games
um but I think you can get to the same
place by studying Theory it's you know
the exploits in the theory are just two

[1:50:45]
the exploits in the theory are just two
sides
of the same coin uh but it is a very
direct way of getting to the correct
exploit to study the population
Tendencies and
ultimately the exploits are really what
matters because you know as we all know

[1:51:02]
matters because you know as we all know
like the GTO strategy is very fragile
and so if one person deviates even
slightly from a game theory optimal
strategy and you node lock that into a
solver a solver is going to completely

[1:51:15]
solver a solver is going to completely
change uh the way it plays so I think
especially when you're first starting
out playing against weaker players the
exploits are really what you should be
focusing on to make the most money
what were when you when you started

[1:51:30]
what were when you when you started
taking working with MDA or maybe also
your experience with yours from Nick
what were some of the mistakes that you
made early on and what do you think are
some mistakes players make when going
down the NDA Street

[1:51:48]
what are some of the mistakes that I
made
because of the MDA strategy also mainly
in your learning process I am imagine
that for example if I speak for my own
experience the way I use data five years

[1:52:01]
experience the way I use data five years
ago is definitely different than how I
use data now I I've I've made plenty of
mistakes and I said ah it didn't really
work like that or you understand what I
mean
yeah

[1:52:15]
yeah
um
I can't really say
there hasn't been something where
I like when I was coaching for the
stable

[1:52:30]
stable
it's a pretty high stakes
situation to be in because
I think
had the highest at the peak we had we
had like a hundred people playing for
poker detox
and so my coaching was it was very much

[1:52:47]
and so my coaching was it was very much
like
if this happens then you do this
so we weren't
obviously you know poker is just such a
complex game there will always be
variation in how people play there's

[1:53:00]
variation in how people play there's
always going to be decisions that people
can make for themselves you can't tell
people to do
just I can't tell people what to do in
every single scenario
but
I was telling people you know specific

[1:53:15]
I was telling people you know specific
things like okay uh I did some research
and I want you guys to call more in this
spot or I want you to Bluff more in this
and so if you tell 100 people to do that
and they all download that information
into their strategy and you're like very
wrong about it uh you can spew money

[1:53:34]
wrong about it uh you can spew money
pretty quickly that way so the stakes
are very high
I was pretty fortunate that that didn't
really happen that I can think of I I
think it's more just like I missed

[1:53:47]
think it's more just like I missed
certain things early on and we kept
building on the strategy
like early on I had a simple strategy
for exploiting recreational players but
then like after a year at poker detox

[1:54:01]
then like after a year at poker detox
some of the students actually came to me
and they showed me
a bunch of stuff that I had missed like
that I didn't even think was
mathematically possible like oh we can
Bluff recreational players in this line
and it's printing money and then when I
saw that I realized

[1:54:16]
saw that I realized
um okay we need to focus entirely on
this for the next few months and we just
overhauled our strategy so
the MDA stuff I think the main weakness
of it is kind of

[1:54:30]
of it is kind of
what people tend to say which is that if
you are
in tougher pools or you face somebody
who
does not play like the the population
tends to play if you don't have any
backup any sort of balance strategy to

[1:54:45]
backup any sort of balance strategy to
fall back on
that can be a big problem so you do need
to have that at some point as you get
higher and higher uh in the stakes in
poker
yeah you need to kind of understand and
I think this is what you were also

[1:55:00]
I think this is what you were also
referring to in the beginning and I
completely agree with that the more you
study Theory the more you actually
become better at exploitation because
you can kind of understand like um
it's unlikely that this will happen
and then you can play around with it and
you can use that data to sort of confirm

[1:55:18]
you can use that data to sort of confirm
your Intuition or like the data if you
look at the solver output and then if
you look at the data it's usually not a
surprise if you put the next of if you
put the two next to each other like oh
this spot arrange is stronger this

[1:55:30]
this spot arrange is stronger this
bottle range is weaker and then if you
look at the solver it's like yeah I can
see why people have trouble having too
strong of a ranger or too weak of a
range here it's usually very uh what's
the what's the correct word inter
intertwined is that Direct
yeah

[1:55:46]
yeah that's why my my logo of my company
is the Mobius strip Mobius poker the the
Mobius strip is like an imaginary
mathematical shape and it's uh it's it's
kind of like a Continuum it looks a
little bit like an infinity symbol but

[1:56:01]
little bit like an infinity symbol but
the Mobius strip looks like a two-sided
object but it's actually a one-sided
object you can just Google it if you're
listening to this it might be better to
just see it but
um just imagine like a a loop which is

[1:56:16]
um just imagine like a a loop which is
looks like it's two-sided but it's
actually Twisted in the middle so it's
it's only one side looping around on
itself continuously and that's kind of
the metaphor for me for poker because
it's exploits and Theory they look like

[1:56:30]
it's exploits and Theory they look like
two separate things but they're actually
just two sides of the same coin I can't
even Define
or tell you what an exploit is without
telling you about some Theory I can't
tell you somebody's over folding here
your next question to me should be what

[1:56:46]
your next question to me should be what
does overfolding mean you know relative
to what and then I have to explain to
you what minimum defense frequency is
and
um you know and Ben pod odds and and
things like that expected value those
types of Concepts

[1:57:00]
types of Concepts
so why did you then move away from at
the end take a more GTO oriented
approach nowadays
when you told this to Nick he said don't
do it don't go down the rabbit hole I've
been there

[1:57:16]
been there
I remember that was just his backstory
right he was fooling full in GTO and
then
yes
I discovered some ways to work with
solvers that I think were more efficient

[1:57:30]
solvers that I think were more efficient
um I think that the the weakest point of
solvers are the aggregation report tools
and they're getting better like GTO
wizard is getting better with their
reports
but um I think people spend way too much
time studying with solvers in individual

[1:57:46]
time studying with solvers in individual
cases looking at one board instead of
looking at solver data in the Aggregate
and so when I first opened up piyo and I
started using it kind of had this I
didn't really even go through that
rabbit hole that Nick went down I think

[1:58:00]
rabbit hole that Nick went down I think
he had told me about that rabbit hole
that he went down and I just saw this
and I thought you know this is a useful
tool but it it's it's actually not it's
kind of useless unless I have

[1:58:15]
kind of useless unless I have
additional tools to work with a lot of
solver data in the aggregate
so around 2021 I met a really talented
developer and I had him build
some custom software for me to start
working with piyo

[1:58:31]
working with piyo
um and so that I could look at a lot of
boards at once and see how certain types
of hand classes are playing
over large subsets of boards on average
and through that I started developing

[1:58:45]
and through that I started developing
simplified strategies where I would
kind of basically create like a table of
frequencies this is how you play middle
pairs in the spot this is how you play
your not value you know bet this

[1:59:00]
your not value you know bet this
percentage of the time make a few
adjustments for texture
then node lock that exact strategy on a
subset of 25 words
and actually tested against piosolver
and see how exploitable it is
um and and just try to get that

[1:59:15]
um and and just try to get that
exploitability down
so
the sort of the software the
infrastructure was already there for me
with hand to note when studying exploits
and so and that was also just a pretty

[1:59:30]
and so and that was also just a pretty
obvious starting point for a lot of
reasons and I spent a good couple of
years on that
but then
it became time just naturally
the exploits you know the the fruit had
been sort of picked from that tree

[1:59:45]
been sort of picked from that tree
I was playing in tougher games my
students were playing in tougher games I
started the program Mobius cash which is
a high stakes staking uh or not staking
program but a high stakes stable
and so I needed balance strategies that

[2:00:00]
and so I needed balance strategies that
players could fall back on
um so it made more sense to start
studying this Theory and I just had to
build the tools to do it
yeah that makes a lot of sense I think
especially when it comes down to
exploits you have to really explain

[2:00:16]
exploits you have to really explain
why and especially when so that people
can identify like oh I'm doing this but
this is actually an exploit and I can do
this in this type of instances whereas
if they only know what the exploit is
and it's not working due to a specific

[2:00:32]
and it's not working due to a specific
opponent that they're playing against
then what else are they going to do so
yeah I think it's very important to
really dig down and to go yeah that's
why we call the mechanics of Poker to
really break down what the mechanics are
and then what the consequences are of

[2:00:45]
and then what the consequences are of
certain actual reaction or certain range
constructions how we then would
differentiate from the optimal strategy
to really learn it at a deeper level
because then you can switch based on the
Tendencies of your pool the Tendencies
of your exact opponent

[2:01:01]
of your exact opponent
um I was curious then in your experience
what are the you found a very effective
way to use the solver what are common
ineffective ways to use a software that
you see out there
like big big traps that people fall for

[2:01:17]
so studying too many individual spots is
one of them and then
drawing conclusions
um about how you should play in all
spots based on one specific word I think

[2:01:30]
spots based on one specific word I think
if anybody's worked with solvers has the
experience of like you just change
one card on the board you know like
there are certain times when a queen 9-3
flop plays one way and then you change
the three to a four and then it changes

[2:01:45]
the three to a four and then it changes
like a lot of stuff but the hands that
you're supposed to be bluffing with or
whatever
um
and and that kind of stuff is I think
what contributes to
just you know people not being able to
study Theory effectively the sort of

[2:02:01]
study Theory effectively the sort of
rabbit holes that my brother went down
on solvers first came out
another thing that I would stress is to
focus on the impact factor of any spot
that you're studying

[2:02:16]
that you're studying
um if you're watching uh poker video and
the guy is talking about how to donk bet
on monotone flops and he's making a 45
minute video about this
I would be a little bit suspect about

[2:02:31]
I would be a little bit suspect about
that coach maybe he just didn't have an
idea for a video and he had to create a
45 minute video that week so he just
picked something out of a hat
but
the reality is even if there is

[2:02:45]
the reality is even if there is
a lot to be learned in that spot
monotone flops are
approximately five percent of flops I
think and uh or maybe even a little bit
less than that and then you only donk
the Flop about one percent of the time
overall

[2:03:00]
overall
and so even if there is a lot to be
learned in this specific spot
it's probably not going to matter very
much if you have imaginary opponents in
this spot because it's just not going to
come up often enough to be relevant to
have a significant impact on your win

[2:03:15]
have a significant impact on your win
rate
and so I encourage people to really
study the fundamentals as much as
possible with the solver
and just look at your database multiply
the amount of hands you create a simple
filter see how many times you

[2:03:31]
filter see how many times you
encountered a spot and then try to get
an estimate for how large the pot was
when that spot occurred multiply those
two numbers together and you have how
much money is actually going into that
particular node of the game tree and

[2:03:45]
particular node of the game tree and
then look at every common node in the
game Shri and actually rank spots that
way that's what I mean when I say the
impact factor of a spot
that can help you to really prioritize
what's important to study and what's not

[2:04:01]
what's important to study and what's not
yeah I think it's very very good advice
I remember when uh when we started our
cfp like in 2019 I believe suddenly a
lot of players uh applied and then
suddenly we had to start so I was like
oh [ __ ] I actually didn't really think
about it there's of what they're gonna

[2:04:15]
about it there's of what they're gonna
do and I was like how should I approach
this and I did exactly what you said I
went to my older manager said okay on
okay hands which vortexes are most
common which spots are most common uh
what is uh actually the average bot size
is only something that came later and
later also I was mainly also comparing

[2:04:32]
later also I was mainly also comparing
like where we're on the Performing where
we're over performing as a group so I
could uh like focus on very specific
spots that we were just simply on the
Performing
um but yeah I think it's a very
effective way I remember actually before

[2:04:46]
effective way I remember actually before
that I was I had two main Study Buddies
and we all took one flop and one one
friend of mine took a ace high monotone
flop and then he shared his uh his
findings and then we we basically we
didn't notice at the time but basically

[2:05:00]
didn't notice at the time but basically
all nice every time when a moment of
Love occurs we can ask you and then
something emotive
it actually someone pointed me out I
think it was last week like oh I went to
the most class of uh of the weko but

[2:05:15]
the most class of uh of the weko but
actually it didn't say anything about
Mono flops and it's true I if a monoflop
comes I'm like hmm monoflop Mona flop
monoflop usually my default just like
take it easy that's my default take it
easy don't bet too big don't go too
crazy that's my default and that's all

[2:05:30]
crazy that's my default and that's all
the studying I've ever done on monitor
flops take it easy that's it I see
modern flop I think take it easy and
other than that I don't bother honestly
um yeah I do the same exact thing
she's like don't overplay your hand or
like when the boys goes like triple

[2:05:46]
like when the boys goes like triple
pairs but triple pair triple bird triple
bird XD is the opposite I'm like oh it's
not take it easy it's like ah depending
depending obviously who the razor is but
if you're the racer triple pass not so
bad
um
or correct me if I'm wrong because I

[2:06:01]
or correct me if I'm wrong because I
have not done any study at triple part
so it is like four four on the board
yeah if you're the Razor four for four
is quite good right
who cares I don't know I was gonna say
uh so some some general advice for the

[2:06:18]
uh so some some general advice for the
people
hi guys Renee aka the weko here with a
quick mechanics of Poker 2.0
announcement in our program you'll get
access to 80 plus hours of content in

[2:06:30]
access to 80 plus hours of content in
which we will explain you all aspects
needed in order to become a more
successful poker player now one of these
of course is the technical aspect of the
game in which I'll be explaining you all
the mechanics behind poker strategies
we'll be talking about GTO exploitive

[2:06:45]
we'll be talking about GTO exploitive
play with an extra focus on the why
behind certain strategies and why the
population has certain leaks and to
increase your win rate even further
we've recently added a River Bluff and
Bluff catching section so you can
increase your in V when those spots

[2:07:00]
increase your in V when those spots
become very big our mindset and
performance coach Adam Carmichael he
took care of the mental game and
performance section of this program in
which he will teach you everything you
need to know in order to break through
limiting beliefs better handle your

[2:07:15]
limiting beliefs better handle your
emotions break free from tilt and play
your A game more consistently lead and
last but not least we've added the
management and optimization section in
the program in which we will give you
various tips and tricks to make it more
likely for your poker career to succeed

[2:07:31]
likely for your poker career to succeed
and how to continuously improve as a
poker player now on top of that this
concept is continuously evolving based
on feedback and suggestions we get from
our community next to all this content
you will have access to our exclusive

[2:07:46]
you will have access to our exclusive
Discord Community monthly live q a calls
and one-on-one coaching session in which
we are going to be reviewing if you have
been implementing the stuff that we
teach you in the mechanics of Poker
correctly so do you think you have what

[2:08:02]
correctly so do you think you have what
it takes to master the mechanics of
Poker go over to mechanicsofpoker.com
and maybe you will get a chance to work
with me and Adam and make more progress
in your poker career but for now without
further Ado let's get back into more

[2:08:17]
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode
what are some things that happen in
let's call it solverland that nobody can
ignore and what are things we should

[2:08:30]
ignore and what are things we should
not be looking to do in most cases that
happen in silverland
um
what are some things
that we can't ignore

[2:08:46]
well
I always start with like the overall
frequencies
I'm not sure if this is kind of what
you're yeah you're getting at with your
question but
like most of what I look at in solvers
is the aggregation reports so defense

[2:09:03]
is the aggregation reports so defense
frequencies in certain spots
um
an example of this like uh
a super important spot that seems like
nobody
is aware of currently is

[2:09:17]
is aware of currently is
how much you have to defend
uh for example when you're in position
facing a large C bet on the flop
whether in single raised pots or in
three bed pots

[2:09:30]
three bed pots
people still overfold in these spots so
much and
it's literally like I I would give the
advice that if somebody bets two-thirds
pot in this spot you should
try to defend as if they bet half pot

[2:09:46]
try to defend as if they bet half pot
and if they about half bot you should
try to defend as if they bet one third
like that's how far people are off still
currently
um so yeah I always focus on like the
overall uh solver frequencies first

[2:10:02]
overall uh solver frequencies first
um
another thing that I would suggest is to
actually node lock your strategies and
see how well they're performing
I first saw sauce do this on a run at

[2:10:15]
I first saw sauce do this on a run at
Once video I haven't like I said before
I haven't watched too much uh poker
content but I did watch several of his
run at once videos and he was the first
person I saw who who'd actually node
lock his strategy in into bio and see
how much TV he lost versus pile solver

[2:10:32]
how much TV he lost versus pile solver
and I think that's just such a valuable
exercise and it's tedious unless you
have software that can help you do it
automatically
uh but it's very worth it and it's a
very humbling exercise

[2:10:46]
very humbling exercise
I think I heard I think it was good
enough we also talked about this this
process in one of the podcasts where he
would come up with an exploit the
strategy and then he would put his
exploitive strategy against pilot to see
how exploitative his exploitive strategy
was

[2:11:00]
was
quite quite quite good stuff yeah what
was for example
you so basically it's like we cannot
ignore for example ndf
that something that solver
it's important in Sovereign also

[2:11:15]
it's important in Sovereign also
important practice but let's say for
example
the fact that you have to let's say for
example prefer Branch I think I think
I've seen some of your stuff that you
don't mind this either you could for
example big plan for a small but you
could three but 50 of King six of fifty

[2:11:31]
could three but 50 of King six of fifty
percent of King seven of or you could
only pick King 7 off
that's something that for example
needing to have all certain hands at a
certain frequency would you say that's
something that's only important in a
solver or would that also be important
in the real real world

[2:11:46]
in the real real world
yeah I think pre-flop uh you can
definitely make big simplifications like
that because your opponents will never
really be able to pick up on whether
you're three betting King 7 offer King

[2:12:00]
you're three betting King 7 offer King
six off and even if they could it might
be pretty difficult most of the time for
them to even construct and exploit based
on that information
but that doesn't even matter because
they're not going to know anyway so
pre-flop is um a spot where I simplify a

[2:12:17]
pre-flop is um a spot where I simplify a
lot lower stake students I'll just have
them play Pure strategies pre-flop so
you know just picking one solid Bluff
combo instead of
five different combos at a 20 frequency

[2:12:31]
five different combos at a 20 frequency
I think works really well
and then you guys if you go further you
can go to like 50 50 mixed frequencies
if that feels better to you but I
wouldn't like go much further than that
honestly the benefit I think becomes
more when you know a hand is a mix that

[2:12:47]
more when you know a hand is a mix that
you shouldn't stay with that but that
you know it's a mix so that you could
for example look at your population
Tendencies or look at your specific
opponent like hey this hand can go
either way do I have a certain incentive
based on how my opponent plays to either

[2:13:00]
based on how my opponent plays to either
go to the left or the right I think
that's what a mixed hand would indicate
and obviously like in a solver
it's very important because the other
guys know your strategy exactly right so
you cannot never have one hand and
always have another hand both pre-flop

[2:13:15]
always have another hand both pre-flop
and post-op because that will have
serious consequences where obviously in
practice like you said well nobody knows
if you if you did instead of on the Flop
at the specific Gutter and you better
did 100 or zero percent obviously if you
do it there sports bar if you do it with
all your draws it's a problem uh but

[2:13:30]
all your draws it's a problem uh but
with specific hands like it doesn't
really matter because no one knows your
exact strategy uh I was curious like how
do so if you look at the the poker
toolkit the poker player toolbox so to
speak we have the hand to notes we have

[2:13:45]
speak we have the hand to notes we have
the solvers
how do these come together I mean you're
very big on like the process of strategy
creation how do these come together in
the process of strategy creation and
should we add maybe another two to the
two box

[2:14:03]
um I think that's
you know like I said before you have to
have an understanding of the theory to
get to the the correct exploit so hand
to note is going to be telling you what

[2:14:15]
to note is going to be telling you what
people are actually doing in practice
whereas pyosolver or just toy game
models uh simpler theory is going to
tell you what they should be doing
and so
if you want to exploit that gap between

[2:14:30]
if you want to exploit that gap between
what people should be doing and what
they are doing I think you need both
tools
um I think the newer tools that are
coming out now are also really
interesting
um
so GTO wizard obviously is a huge

[2:14:46]
so GTO wizard obviously is a huge
development the trainers are a big
development like I think initially
people were a little bit skeptical about
them like how much is this actually
improving it's like this thing's giving
me six bet sizes and it's trying to like

[2:15:00]
me six bet sizes and it's trying to like
teach me on all this irrelevant stuff
but that's it was just the initial phase
of trainers I think trainers are just
going to get more and more practical
as they improve the software and improve
the user experience

[2:15:15]
the user experience
AI right you already see that yeah yeah
and
um I guess you know I I spend a lot of
time and resources getting custom uh
software built for me

[2:15:30]
software built for me
um so if you are able to do that that's
huge as well and like you there's not
not really like a bigger Edge that you
can have I think than to have some sort
of software or tool that other people in

[2:15:45]
of software or tool that other people in
your games are just not using I mean
before solvers came out on the public
market before piyo was released in 2015.
I think a lot of the best players had
their own private solver that they were

[2:16:00]
their own private solver that they were
working with
so that that's just a huge advantage
I mean next to this point what is an
often overlooked or underestimated way
to increase your EV as a poker player in
European so we already have developing
software that gives you an asset other

[2:16:16]
software that gives you an asset other
people don't have is there another one
maximizing your win rate against
recreational players I think is the
biggest one that still gets overlooked
it's it's a little bit more common now

[2:16:31]
it's it's a little bit more common now
to hear that but even now
if you just go on a poker training site
and you click on a random video I think
the probability that they're even going
to mention strategy against recreational
players is pretty low

[2:16:45]
players is pretty low
I don't know what percentage of videos
cover this but it's not nearly enough
and it's kind of absurd when you think
well probably like 80 plus percent of
your income
comes from the recreational player now
maybe it's only 10 or 20 of the hands

[2:17:02]
maybe it's only 10 or 20 of the hands
that you play is against recreational
players but those hands are worth all
the money and if you're a weaker reg it
might be more than 100 of your income
comes from recreational players because
you might be winning from the racks and

[2:17:16]
you might be winning from the racks and
then paying rake obviously and then
maybe losing a little bit back to the
stronger regs but you're still profiting
so
I mean there's there's just so much that
changes like if you're just studying GTO

[2:17:31]
changes like if you're just studying GTO
um
even just pre-flop like your pre-flop
ranges are based on a simulation which
was assuming that you had a bunch of
other players at your table who were
also playing a perfectly balanced
strategy and that you could not have an

[2:17:47]
strategy and that you could not have an
edge on them post flop
so even something like your opening
range is going to change drastically
just by putting one recreational player
to your left who's playing maybe 20 too

[2:18:00]
to your left who's playing maybe 20 too
many hands
and then factor in the fact that their
their win rate is negative 30 big blinds
per 100 and so obviously that is going
to incentivize you to play a lot more
hands and get involved in a lot more

[2:18:15]
hands and get involved in a lot more
pots against them
I would just encourage people
um to
just
try to exercise logic to think more
about how how you could possibly exploit

[2:18:30]
about how how you could possibly exploit
the recreational players
at your table because although like any
fundamentally sound strategy will work
that doesn't mean that you're getting
the maximum out of recreational players
and because they are such a large

[2:18:45]
and because they are such a large
portion of your income like any
improvements you can make on them are
just worth so much
I think also all the time that you spent
in recreational players
are like endlessly valuable because it

[2:19:00]
are like endlessly valuable because it
doesn't matter if you move the stakes
doesn't matter Recreation is
recreational so all the work you put in
and it's also unlikely for them to
change so all the strategies that you
develop versus recreational it will
probably be better for the next 10 years
at least assuming that you know
recreationals they don't suddenly all

[2:19:15]
recreationals they don't suddenly all
decide to come together and be like us
as Recreation players are going to come
up with a better strategy it's unlikely
to happen so it's very yeah like your
return of investment in the time that
you put in compared to let's say for
example I put my time in coming up with
a strategy against Patrick Howard and

[2:19:30]
a strategy against Patrick Howard and
then suddenly Patrick Howard the whole
half year later has also changed the
strategy or has improved then I've put
it all the time in and then six months
later it's worth less whereas first
recreational players it will remain very
valuable I think it's also like a flaw
right we we try to improve so we win and

[2:19:46]
right we we try to improve so we win and
then against the recreation players like
oh we're already winning anyway so
there's less of a motivation to to start
while it's actually indeed well if you
could double your win rate there against
them that's is going to have the most
significant impact on your win rate

[2:20:00]
significant impact on your win rate
there's nothing else you can do that
boosts your win rate
at a higher level than getting better
versus recreationals
um
Adam recreational players in the hands
of Sydney World it was warring with
racks and then you get to basically you

[2:20:16]
racks and then you get to basically you
go through hell and then you get into
Havana and you only you only play Fish
correct
yeah kind of like that so you'll
basically be established at a level and
then you just boom hunt and player
recreationals all day long and then

[2:20:30]
recreationals all day long and then
they'll have other wrecks of a shooting
at level so you have to defend your
lobbies against kind of promising right
so upcoming and then if you move up
Stakes to another level you've got a rag
battle in war against the regs at those
levels to almost get initiated into the
new level so you have these spaces where

[2:20:45]
new level so you have these spaces where
there's many months of Just Right
battling and then many months of just
play Recreations but yeah as Patrick
said like looking back in my career I
wasted way too much time on reg Dynamics
and playing as regs like so my friends
who just want fish Crushers made so much
more money than me because they're just

[2:21:00]
more money than me because they're just
obsessed with how to squeeze every bit
of edge or every recreational player and
I think in almost all poly Dynamics
that's gonna be the way to make the most
profit so yeah it's a it's an
interesting thing because as Patrick
mentions the kind of skill towards GTR
strategies and optimal players in terms

[2:21:17]
strategies and optimal players in terms
of content that's produced courses
produced is probably way too high
relative to where companies made in
poker so uh yeah focusing on
recreational strategies I think you
can't really go wrong in terms of the
knowledge you'll learn there so yeah
definitely worth spending time all right

[2:21:30]
definitely worth spending time all right
I want to do a little bit of reflecting
for you Patrick so first of all reflect
a bit on your Port career itself and
then reflect on your experiences around
being around players and what you've
learned being in the poker landscape so
first of all what would you say is the
most important lesson poker has given

[2:21:45]
most important lesson poker has given
you maybe being a player in particular
what's the most important things it's
taught you
there's a lot of lessons
I think the first one that comes to mind
is that your senses and your intuition
are a lot more fallible than you think

[2:22:01]
are a lot more fallible than you think
so just going back to the cognitive
biases
uh we're not rational creatures we're
like fundamentally irrational
another one is that you cannot expect

[2:22:16]
another one is that you cannot expect
immediate results uh based on a change
that you make in your game like the
universe doesn't really care
if you made a huge Improvement to your
game this week you know let's say even
by some miracle you managed to double

[2:22:31]
by some miracle you managed to double
your win rate from
two and a half big blinds per hundred to
five overnight
you may not see that play out for
another six months or more
you can go on a huge Break Even stretch

[2:22:47]
you can go on a huge Break Even stretch
or downswing so the universe doesn't
really care about uh what you're putting
into it I think
uh there's a phrase that I like you're
entitled to the fruits

[2:23:00]
entitled to the fruits
uh you're entitled to the action never
to its fruits
um I like that a lot I think about poker
in that way
um
the last thing that I I'll mention is
that I think poker has shown me that you

[2:23:17]
that I think poker has shown me that you
generally
can't avoid
variance without reducing your expected
value
so you can't really play it safe without
costing yourself money

[2:23:32]
costing yourself money
in general and the variance and the
uncertainty is just like something that
you have to embrace you can't run away
from it
they were great yeah it's the whole uh
risk reward ratio as well if you want
more rewards you have to take more risks

[2:23:46]
more rewards you have to take more risks
to kind of get in touch with that you
actually mentioned something which I
want to touch on now which is a paper
timing you mentioned something called
statistical uncertainty and you said
most players don't know how to calculate
this and they actually completely miss
it so could you explain what statistical

[2:24:00]
it so could you explain what statistical
on 30 years and what are players
generally missing when it comes to this
statistical uncertainty is just
um you know how much statistical error
there is in a certain stat that you
might be looking at so for example if

[2:24:16]
might be looking at so for example if
you're looking at somebody's three bet
frequency
you have a certain number of trials that
they had an opportunity to three bed and
then you've got their actual frequency
that they three bet
most stats in poker are a binomial

[2:24:31]
most stats in poker are a binomial
probability distribution that just means
that there's two states like a coin flip
could be either heads or tails either
they were bluffing or value-betting or
either they three bed or they did in
three beds
and so that's a fairly easy thing to

[2:24:47]
and so that's a fairly easy thing to
model in statistics
um you can I don't remember the the
numbers off the top of my head usually
but it's like if you have
400 trials on a sample
and

[2:25:01]
and
you want to be using like a let's say a
90 confidence interval
um the statistical uncertainty and
that's that might be like four percent
and so if somebody's three bet over 400

[2:25:16]
and so if somebody's three bet over 400
trials is 15
then what it actually means is that
their three bet is not 15 it might be
15 plus or minus four percent at a 90
percent confidence interval so you can

[2:25:32]
percent confidence interval so you can
be 90 confident that the three bet is
within that range but that's all you can
really say that that's just the observed
value it's not the True Value
so this is really important when you're

[2:25:46]
so this is really important when you're
trying to exploit players and also when
you're trying to do database analysis is
to actually know when you are looking at
signal and when you are just looking at
Pure Noise
because if you're you know just

[2:26:01]
because if you're you know just
developing strategies without thinking
about uncertainty at all you're a lot of
the time you're just going to be
developing strategies based on noise and
and nonsense and it's going to be less
accurate and just make your strategy way

[2:26:15]
accurate and just make your strategy way
more complicated than if you just focus
on the signal that you actually have
your sample size for so in my training
in physics I had a few professors that
were just absolute
um
they were just so strict about

[2:26:31]
they were just so strict about
drilling this and making sure that every
single lab that we did we Quantified the
uncertainty in our measurements and so I
just took that from physics and applied
it to poker but I think it's a big thing
that people miss
yeah very interesting so where do

[2:26:48]
yeah very interesting so where do
players misapply this what do you feel
like people play as lack of
understanding cost them a lot here is it
basically overreacting to short sample
sizes is it making adjustments to data
points that don't necessarily reflect

[2:27:01]
points that don't necessarily reflect
what the number is saying how do you
think players are potentially missing
out here and without understanding this
yeah like for example I'll tell a player
that you should Bluff in a certain line
because people overfold

[2:27:15]
because people overfold
and they'll try it three times and
they'll be like well I got called three
times this doesn't work I don't and
they'll literally stop doing it and you
have to kind of sit them down and
explain to them that like the the sample
size that they're looking at is not

[2:27:30]
size that they're looking at is not
significant and they might actually
never get a significant sample size in
their career or maybe it'll take years
for it to converge
um and so that's a big thing is just
people who are kind of letting
short-term results dictate their

[2:27:46]
short-term results dictate their
strategy uh when they really shouldn't
be
yeah this is a tough one for players so
what would you recommend for let's say
there's some data points let's say it's
in a river spot where the sample size is
always going to be relatively low so
there's a lot of statistical uncertainty

[2:28:01]
there's a lot of statistical uncertainty
there's a lot of kind of variants in
that sample how do you instill in your
players who you work with or who you
speak with
how do you override the kind of the
mindbone to Anchor to that number let's
say you say if someone Falls four times

[2:28:15]
say you say if someone Falls four times
in a row so it starts at 100 folds and
they overreact to that so how do you get
to that kind of more balance is it just
the understanding by just going over
numbers getting someone to understand
exactly what sample size would be
relevant here how are they going to
bridge that gap between what they're
experiencing and the numbers themselves

[2:28:32]
experiencing and the numbers themselves
I think doing population research is the
most important thing and that'll give
you a larger sample size and everybody
has a database large enough if you're a
professional poker player as long as you
play on track sites you can do

[2:28:46]
play on track sites you can do
population research
having an understanding of the variance
and the statistical uncertainty is also
very important
um it's something that I've always
stressed in my coaching is to not just
tell people what to do but to actually
show all of the empirical evidence and

[2:29:02]
show all of the empirical evidence and
like the proofs of how I got there so I
found that like
if you're telling people to do something
that'll go a certain way but if you
actually show them proof of you know

[2:29:15]
actually show them proof of you know
this is why this works this is the math
behind how this works it gives people a
lot more confidence to actually use
those strategies even if they're not
just you know they're not working in the
short term
yeah it's almost like providing enough
evidence to counter the current stunts

[2:29:32]
evidence to counter the current stunts
and if you show them your the methods
you went through how you worked it out
you've got data to back it up yeah I
think a lot of players will be able to
change their strategy in that context
and so what would you say has been some
of the greatest contributors to your
success you've had a background in

[2:29:46]
success you've had a background in
physics you've got like a scientific
approach to learning and quantifying
stuff what do you think has allowed you
to be both a successful poker player and
then be able to uh then transition into
teaching Concepts at a high level to
high stakes poker players

[2:30:01]
uh I think that I've
I've taken
a contrarian approach to the game in a
few key areas and
I think if you want to have outsized

[2:30:15]
I think if you want to have outsized
results in poker you have to have some
contrarian ideas and do things
differently than the average poker
player is doing because if you just do
what the average player is doing you're
going to get average results usually

[2:30:31]
going to get average results usually
so
one example of a contrarian idea would
be kind of what I've already talked
about with maximizing your address
recreationals first and then focusing on
the regular second
um
I'm also

[2:30:45]
I'm also
really really big on Simplicity in my
game and being humble enough to accept
that
I can't remember all the things that I'm
studying when I'm away from the tables
and there's actually a very limited

[2:31:01]
and there's actually a very limited
amount of things that I can study and
execute in game
so basically what's happening
in my brain when I'm studying away from
the tables is very different from the
reality of playing six or eight tables

[2:31:16]
reality of playing six or eight tables
at a Time online
and you've got real money on the line
and maybe you're on a 20 buy and
downswing
your strategy has to be way simpler than
you think you need it to be

[2:31:30]
you think you need it to be
in order for it to be actually you know
ready to go into battle with
and I've also touched on this already
but I think
I take a lot more accountability over my
play than

[2:31:46]
play than
maybe the average poker player does
um so things like developing this stat
Checker that I've developed
automatically checking my stats against
the solver frequencies in every single
spot or at least every common spot in

[2:32:02]
spot or at least every common spot in
the game tree
and really not allowing any leaks to
persist just having complete Vision over
my own game and sort of obsessing over
plugging leaks and when you do that you

[2:32:16]
plugging leaks and when you do that you
also
you're not just obsessed with plugging
your own leaks but it becomes pretty
easy to like take that mindset and then
turn it against your opponents and find
their leaks uh that they're not
willing or able to fix

[2:32:32]
willing or able to fix
you seem like someone who's very precise
and details orientateds are these traits
that you think are common amongst other
highest expression players or do you
think they need it as traits to succeed
in the modern poker world

[2:32:48]
I think so and when I think of like the
two most successful poker players in my
network
one of them would be Matt Marinelli who

[2:33:01]
one of them would be Matt Marinelli who
was just on the podcast and there would
be Yuri Martin's another absolute
Crusher and I hope you guys can have him
on the podcast at some point I would be
really interested to watch that
um The Common Thread that I see between

[2:33:15]
um The Common Thread that I see between
both of these guys is that
they just don't really have any
weaknesses
and
um you know that might seem obvious or
like a tautology but it's it's like they
are just obsessed with plugging their

[2:33:30]
are just obsessed with plugging their
leaks and so if you tell them you know
you're overfolding in this spot
that leak maybe has a week or two before
it's just gone and it's just eradicated
um so yeah I think

[2:33:45]
um so yeah I think
uh in general the the more successful
poker players will be a lot more precise
in that way
you mentioned earlier that players who
are more kind to themselves will
generally do better in poker how does
the detailed oriented is very precise

[2:34:02]
the detailed oriented is very precise
wants to solve everything quite
precisely
personality gel well with trying to be
counting themselves how do you kind of
find that sweet spot between always
trying to do better always trying to
learn whilst also not beating yourself
up in that process is anything that

[2:34:15]
up in that process is anything that
comes to mind for that yeah it's hard
and it does kind of sound like a
contradiction right but there's all of
these kind of paradoxes in poker where
you you have
um technical skills and then you have
soft skills and you have to kind of find
a sweet spot
in between

[2:34:30]
in between
and
um I would just say you know like the
strongest poker players that I know it's
there's no
sort of uh shortcut like they're just
strong in all of these areas
so it's like yes and like yes there are

[2:34:47]
so it's like yes and like yes there are
extremely technically uh proficient and
detail-oriented
and also
they have the ability to
forgive themselves be a little bit
easier on themselves when that's
important they work on their mindset a

[2:35:01]
important they work on their mindset a
lot too
and so I think they just approached like
they they attacked the game from all
angles like that's kind of what you have
to do if you if you want to be one of
the best in the world at something you
kind of have to be
a nine out of 10 or a 10 out of 10 and

[2:35:16]
a nine out of 10 or a 10 out of 10 and
almost every area
um yeah you almost can't have any weak
links or if you have wig links you need
to be directly attacking those at some
points so what do you think are some of
the common maybe beliefs or
misconceptions that a lot of stick a lot

[2:35:31]
misconceptions that a lot of stick a lot
of mid-stakes players have that maybe
prevent them from getting to the higher
levels anything that you feel like maybe
mental blocks that yeah in particular
the mid to low stakes guys hold on to
that prevents them from reaching higher
Heights

[2:35:45]
Heights
just that the those high stakes games
are
like a thousand times more difficult to
beat than the lower Stakes games they're
really not
um
you know like
I I when I talk to students who are

[2:36:02]
I I when I talk to students who are
playing these games and I especially
talk to Matt a lot about this and he's
obviously wildly talented so he's gonna
have this perspective but
he's consistently said to me that like

[2:36:15]
he's consistently said to me that like
every new level that he gets to he's
like expecting it to be this huge jump
in difficulty and it's just really not
um if anything when you get to a really
high level
the games get easier uh from a technical

[2:36:30]
the games get easier uh from a technical
standpoint I think from a mental game
standpoint the games get exponentially
more difficult as you go up in Stakes
because the mindset difficulty just
scales with the stakes and the stakes go
up exponentially so
the challenge at a certain point

[2:36:46]
the challenge at a certain point
when you get to nosebleeds is actually
like the games are maybe technically
easier because they often just run
around a recreational player or if you
get to the Holy Grail I would say you
know private games where you've got just

[2:37:01]
know private games where you've got just
like tons of recreational players and
playing for super high stakes
then it becomes more of a mindset
challenge like that that's you know just
just not losing your mind is is the Big
Challenge there

[2:37:15]
Challenge there
um but yeah I think low stakes players
just they overestimate the difficulty
and then the skill level of players at
Stakes above them
it's interesting you said the mindset
difficulties scale with the stakes they
play and from one on goal I'm saying the

[2:37:30]
play and from one on goal I'm saying the
uh the money that's on the line and the
swings that you're going to take
relative to maybe your bankroll how do
you think players should be thinking
about risk and how much risk they take
at different phases of their career I
know this is a challenging question to
ask but I feel like players
struggle to know what is the kind of

[2:37:47]
struggle to know what is the kind of
line to be to be looking for in terms of
how much risk to reward I should be
taking a certain parts of my career and
how do I start to make good choices to
uh take on enough risk because as we've
mentioned throughout this conversation
which only risk adverse people we
generally will do things that don't lead

[2:38:01]
generally will do things that don't lead
to too much risk but they have other
personality types who are just way too
Reckless they'll just take way too much
risks in terms of the bankroll so any
advice for players on how to think about
risk at various stages of their careers
I would love to publish some optimal

[2:38:15]
I would love to publish some optimal
bankroll strategies at some point in my
career
um I've got a developer who I've
collaborated with on other articles on
variance he's a super smart guy
um and and he's able to do the math and
the simulations behind this and I would
love to co-author something with him

[2:38:31]
love to co-author something with him
because it's kind of insane to me that
it's 2023 and we've got thousands of
people playing poker professionally and
there is still really not like a a clear
guide for this is how many buy-ins you

[2:38:46]
guide for this is how many buy-ins you
should have if you are playing at this
lemon like this is when you should take
a shot
um
I think
that if you were to ask a computer what
the optimal bankroll strategy is how

[2:39:00]
the optimal bankroll strategy is how
much risk you should be taking the
computer would tell you something that
is insanely aggressive like way more
aggressive than what most people are
comfortable with
I think you could you could probably get
away with like 10 or 20 buy-ins if
you're just taking small shots and I
think a computer would tell you that

[2:39:15]
think a computer would tell you that
that's like the mathematically most
efficient way to move up in Stakes
um I tend to Advocate us what I call
small Jabs approach to moving up in
stakes and so you're keeping a smaller

[2:39:30]
stakes and so you're keeping a smaller
bankroll
and let's say it's 20 buy-ins or 30
buy-ins when you get over that amount
you take a two or a four by-in shot at
the next stake and you assume that that
shot is probably going to fail 80 of the

[2:39:47]
shot is probably going to fail 80 of the
time
um but you know it's faster than waiting
until you have a really big back roll to
play at the next stake another thing I
would suggest is
if you do stick The Landing at a limit

[2:40:03]
if you do stick The Landing at a limit
let's say you move up to 200-0 and you
make
20 buy-ins and now you're rolled for 200
now
imagine you know if your previous
biggest downswing in your career was two

[2:40:17]
biggest downswing in your career was two
thousand dollars
um now you could withstand a four
thousand dollar downswing and still be
playing 200 mL you're still where you're
at where you were at when you first took
the shot
I don't think it's healthy to go on a

[2:40:32]
I don't think it's healthy to go on a
downswing which is like more than 2X or
around 3x your previous biggest
downswing I think it's just too
detrimental for most players mindsets
so what I suggest is like even if you

[2:40:45]
so what I suggest is like even if you
stick The Landing at your next limit
um and you make a bunch of buy-ins and
you're rolled for that keep an eye on
like when you go on a downswing how big
that downswing is in proportion to
your previous downswings and really
check in with yourself how am I dealing

[2:41:01]
check in with yourself how am I dealing
with this emotionally is this affecting
my play it takes a really honest look
but you can do it if you're honest with
yourself and preemptively move down and
just make some of that money back before
you continue playing at this new stake I

[2:41:16]
you continue playing at this new stake I
think that can do a lot uh to avoid
burnout
because you know it's kind of a a double
whammy when you go on your biggest
downswing ever
and then you have to move down to make
it back and it feels like it's going to

[2:41:30]
it back and it feels like it's going to
take forever to make that back I don't
think you really want to put yourself in
that position it's way better to just
move down preemptively
other things you have to think about are
like
what is your life situation so are you a
single guy with absolutely no dependence

[2:41:47]
single guy with absolutely no dependence
and low rent if that's the case then you
can make you can take a lot bigger risks
if you have um
a side income you can take bigger risks
on the flip side if you have a family
and you have people depending on you you

[2:42:00]
and you have people depending on you you
can't take risks like that you just have
to factor that in
I think um computer is gonna most of the
time be more aggressive than people are
willing to go so the limiting factor is
just going to be how strong is your
mindset and how much risk can you take

[2:42:15]
mindset and how much risk can you take
on and still play your best and just try
to optimize for that
yeah as he was speaking there I was
thinking how many complicated scenarios
unfold just from same people mistakes so
I can see why lots of players get stuck
at a certain level because like I said

[2:42:31]
at a certain level because like I said
like when you play aggressive shot taken
you might feel that shot tick 80s at the
time that's really disencouraging for a
lot of players and even if they mentally
knew that going in to have four out of
five shot ticks failing and you have to
move back down and kind of rebuild a

[2:42:45]
move back down and kind of rebuild a
little bit is quite a challenging thing
to deal with then you let's say you shot
taking you get established at a level
and then you go on a new downswing which
is double what you'd ever been on before
and now if they move downstairs to
re-grind it up all these kind of things
that go on just from you trying to kind
of Step Up the kind of ladder in the

[2:43:01]
of Step Up the kind of ladder in the
poker world so yeah it's one of those
really interesting things where players
really need to be mindful of their
tolerance for risk and how it's going to
play out in this almost like a branch of
probabilities that can unfold from your
shot taken and as you mentioned all the
things you you said there were great
advice for protecting yourself from the

[2:43:16]
advice for protecting yourself from the
worst case scenario which worst case
scenario is probably either losing a lot
in the short term or moving up stakes
and then losing a lot and having to move
down and regrind
um some players are very good at
thinking in Bargains I remember a
conversation with Sunni on the podcast
and he almost like eradicated the kind

[2:43:32]
and he almost like eradicated the kind
of variance at higher Stakes because he
just looks at his graph and buy and he
doesn't really think about
um how much he's swinging in terms of
money some players are very good at that
I'd say it's quite rare most players
will get attached to the monetary value
at some stage and like yeah as Brandon's

[2:43:45]
at some stage and like yeah as Brandon's
mentioned as well Financial pressures in
your immediate environments can be a
huge Factor when you're shot taken and
how much risk you're able to take on so
yeah lots of consider I think it's one
of those factors and if you could do
something in terms of the probabilities
and a really statistical

[2:44:00]
and a really statistical
um or other people how to take risk and
how to shot take that'd be amazing
because I think that's really missing in
the pocket landscape I think almost all
players are guessing based on some
calculations but yeah there's no real
guide for most players and I think
almost any play I speak with is moving
up Stakes or thinking about moving

[2:44:15]
up Stakes or thinking about moving
mistakes at some points and they're
trying to figure out the the kind of
right strategy so yeah I think something
creative that space would be super super
useful running yourself how do you
approach taking risk when you're moving
upstairs back in the past what were some
of the things you considered when you
were deciding whether shot tick

[2:44:32]
were deciding whether shot tick
I actually agree with what the Patrick
said the computer will be way more
aggressive because the computer will not
take in consideration the human factor
right like it just takes your win rate
and assumes you play exactly the same

[2:44:45]
and assumes you play exactly the same
when you have to move down to the
previous stake there's like so much
human factors to take consideration as
well how comfortable you are at risk I
was always I would say on the careful
side one thing that I would always do
that I think it may be a good advice for
people I would make the shot smaller so

[2:45:03]
people I would make the shot smaller so
let's say you play 100 NL and the next
stake is five or nothing else that's
quite a big jump but I would just do is
if I would be playing 200 now I would
sell how much is that I would sell 200
500 so that's uh we can do the math real

[2:45:16]
500 so that's uh we can do the math real
quick 40 or something
um oh so forty percent of 500 then also
I would be playing 200 on 300 now
and then I would sell that's 350 now 400
now so I would make that jump smaller
and then when I would reach 5010 I would
almost do the same I would say like okay

[2:45:31]
almost do the same I would say like okay
now I'm at 100 now I will sell 40 so
I'll play 500 down on 600 and then 5007
until now 500 now that's how I would
slowly move up the stakes also I would
try to
not have too big of a range in stake so

[2:45:47]
not have too big of a range in stake so
let's say I would move up to 5000 I
would also prefer to I would rather
prefer to no longer play 200 now and
just sell 50 of my action for 1knl so I
would only play five nothing else so you
would also reduce the swings for example

[2:46:00]
would also reduce the swings for example
so these are like some things that I
would do to short take a bit more
carefully but like I said I was
definitely a bit more on the careful
side I'm not I think we talked about
this in other parts because I'm not I'm
not I'm definitely more of a less of a

[2:46:15]
not I'm definitely more of a less of a
risk taker more of a play it safe type
of type of person
but I do agree like The Compound Effect
is huge if you look at
a shot for example working out
yeah it's it's very hard to to not

[2:46:33]
yeah it's it's very hard to to not
um vote for taking shots aggressively
yeah and and on that note game selection
becomes increasingly important uh when
you're shot taking so yeah exactly I

[2:46:47]
you're shot taking so yeah exactly I
don't yeah don't take your shot because
you got to 30 buy-ins or something and
it's a Tuesday night and there's no fish
at the the 500 now tables that you're
taking a shot at like wait until the

[2:47:01]
taking a shot at like wait until the
Saturday night when there's tons of fish
in the games
that has a huge impact on How likely
your shot is to work out and like you
said a shot working out I mean it's like
the most important thing that can happen
for your income because

[2:47:17]
for your income because
the only thing that's going to
exponentially increase your earnings in
poker is moving up in Stakes
you can play more volume but that's
going to increase your earnings linearly
you can increase your win rate that also
is going to increase linearly but if you

[2:47:30]
is going to increase linearly but if you
can increase your Stakes that's how you
exponentially increase your earnings
because your your earnings double every
time you you double your Stakes
so it's really important that those
shots work out
yeah players I think make the mistake
that they suddenly say well now I play

[2:47:46]
that they suddenly say well now I play
5000 I'm shooting 500 now and now I'm
going to play 500 and they just sit down
at a 400 game like maybe not the
smartest idea right so from this moment
you will take shots when the game is
good that's basically that's basically I
remember

[2:48:00]
remember
all the way in the beginning of my post
career uh I I I I started to I actually
started to live together with a guy and
he said no I play 200 now but in the
weekend I play five or nothing now or
foreign

[2:48:16]
it made a lot of sense in the weekend
the games were better so he would play
higher and this was like his shot taking
routine in weekends I play higher than
during the week I think that's also
actually valuable advice it was funny
listening to you I wrote Tom

[2:48:30]
listening to you I wrote Tom
it's a bit of a depressing conclusion
you have to be a 10 to in order to be
creative poke you have to be a 10 out of
10 and everything and you have to not
lose your mind there was two boys listen
like this could be very a bit uh
discouraging for uh for a lot of people

[2:48:45]
discouraging for uh for a lot of people
on on the point of I wanted to ask like
on the point of talent I think you
mentioned about math math is just
extremely talented I quote do you
believe that I do believe when we
usually ask this question in a
questionnaire
like do you believe that you can put any

[2:49:01]
like do you believe that you can put any
achieve anything you put your mind to or
do you believe Talent is a very big
factor and you actually said that you
believe you can achieve anything you
commit yourself to so can anyone become
a high sex poker player in your opinion

[2:49:15]
uh
I feel like some people don't have it
uh you know it just maybe on an infinite
timeline they could figure it out but
sometimes
I it's hard for me to

[2:49:30]
I it's hard for me to
be straight with people and and tell
them this it's probably one of the
things I've struggled with the most as a
coach is like how do you tell a guy that
he just doesn't have what it takes and
that he should go do something else and
is it even my place to say that it's a

[2:49:45]
is it even my place to say that it's a
tough question but in my experience yeah
I I feel like
you know you you see a person just make
the same mistakes over and over again or
sometimes they'll fix one leak but then
two other leaks will just randomly

[2:50:00]
two other leaks will just randomly
spring up out of nowhere and it's like
you're playing whack-a-mole with their
leaks when you're when you're trying to
coach them
uh no I don't think that anybody can do
this I think it might even be
irresponsible to to tell people that

[2:50:17]
irresponsible to to tell people that
anybody can beat high stakes it is just
it's an inherently challenging thing
there's a huge survivorship bias when
you are
interviewing people who have really made
it in poker you get a different

[2:50:33]
it in poker you get a different
perspective then then you know what the
reality is which is a lot of people
don't make it most people don't make it
you say they don't have it what's it

[2:50:47]
that's a good question
um I mean it
sometimes I feel like people just lack
some sort of fundamental logic around
poker like

[2:51:01]
poker like
I'll see a play get made
way too often where a person will fold a
hand
versus a bet on the river that has value
domination on their opponent's betting
range

[2:51:15]
range
and it's like they think that they're
Bluff catching and they're not even
Bluff catching they're beating value
um
were on the flip side just making huge
polarization errors like turning a hand
into a bluff that should just never be a
bluff

[2:51:30]
bluff
these things will for sure happen for
any player early on in a career but it's
just like if somebody's
studying and practicing poker for years
and they're still making these types of
fundamental errors
that's the red flag that I don't know

[2:51:45]
that's the red flag that I don't know
whatever it is like their brain just
isn't really wired uh to play poker
I don't know what it is I think it's a
it's a variety of different things yeah
I I I if you would ask me the question I

[2:52:02]
I I I if you would ask me the question I
also would not be able to give you a
specific specific answer uh so yeah
that's why I usually ask guests so we
gather more information on what we all
think it is but

[2:52:16]
think it is but
I do think everyone can make money
playing poker so where do you think for
the majority is like the ceiling because
I do I do think at the real high stakes
you need to have it but like below that
I think I think you can turn anyone into

[2:52:31]
I think I think you can turn anyone into
a winning
everyone or at least majority I think
can make a living playing poker like
obviously for example you have to maybe
choose your environment really well
depending on what like your Max Capacity
is in skill for example

[2:52:47]
is in skill for example
when you say anyone do you mean like the
general population or starting from
poker enthusiasts let's start let's
start from people who naturally
naturally get into poker yeah because I
think if you just they are a bit

[2:53:00]
think if you just they are a bit
pre-selected of course yeah and you
started explaining pre-flop ranges to
them they were just like just completely
space on
um
but yeah among people who are already
playing poker
I think

[2:53:15]
I think
probably somewhere around
100 200 NL given well it's very
different so like I'm a cash game player
so I'm I'm giving you cash game uh
mistakes not not tournaments but
um obviously live poker is completely

[2:53:31]
um obviously live poker is completely
different from online your win rates are
way higher in live poker because you
can't get as many hands in and then you
know right now we've got a very weird
situation where
certain sites have incredibly soft cash

[2:53:46]
certain sites have incredibly soft cash
games and then you have you know Stars
100 NL or 200 now it's actually like
playing pretty tough whereas you know if
you go in right now the US is the best
place to play cash games

[2:54:01]
place to play cash games
or I've been kind of keeping quiet about
this but India is probably the the
regulated sites on India are I think the
softest games the softest regulated
games in the world right now and it
almost feels like if you could just

[2:54:15]
almost feels like if you could just
and like anybody with a pulse you could
put someone in those games and teach
them a few things and you know half the
players at the table or recreationals
they're going to make money
unfortunately India just passed some
pretty horrible regulations taxing not

[2:54:31]
pretty horrible regulations taxing not
even winnings which were already heavily
taxed but they're taxing deposits now 30
so you put 100 on the site and you get
to play with 70 and that's going into
effect I think a month or two from now
so
it seems like it's kind of going to be

[2:54:45]
it seems like it's kind of going to be
GG for those Indian games which is a
really sad thing to see for the future
of Poker
but um anyway getting back to your
question I think 500 now
um in general is where it starts to get
pretty real for most people

[2:55:02]
pretty real for most people
yeah I would agree with that and then
live like I said I think the equivalent
200 L online is maybe five then live
something like that I have very little
live experience but from what I saw in

[2:55:16]
live experience but from what I saw in
the limited experience I think that's
that's probably a fair a fair
comparisment
um
what are you currently most curious and
excited for when it comes down to Poker

[2:55:32]
excited for when it comes down to Poker
or poker strategy
let's say for example I would message
you I want to do a strategy session with
you what topic do I need to bring up in
order for you to get enthusiastic

[2:55:48]
um
so as far as what I'm excited about I
think it's going to sound like an ad
because I think you guys are sponsored
by them but GTO wizard is like a very
exciting uh tool to me because I've met

[2:56:04]
exciting uh tool to me because I've met
the guys on that team personally
um I don't have any stake in the company
I I have like a an affiliate code that I
make look like 100 bucks a month off of
so I'm not uh too biased on this but I

[2:56:17]
so I'm not uh too biased on this but I
just really think that they're like
an extremely smart
hard-working
group of people
and they're just going to keep making
that product better and better and

[2:56:30]
that product better and better and
better and it's it's kind of insane how
quickly
they are progressing and just dominating
the space uh in trainers
so I'm really excited about that tool
and seeing like what they can accomplish

[2:56:46]
and seeing like what they can accomplish
with that because
I mean I I personally just see so many
ways that they can improve that product
and and make studying more efficient uh
for people who are willing to put the
work in

[2:57:01]
um
as far as
what excites me uh study wise right now
um I'm interested in simplified
GTO strategies so any sort of like

[2:57:15]
GTO strategies so any sort of like
heuristics
um that can simplify range composition
down from like the infinite complexity
of a solver which is something that a
human can actually execute
and I'm also pretty interested in uh

[2:57:31]
and I'm also pretty interested in uh
cash game Bots right now so I don't mean
uh using Bots to play in real games to
cheat with I'm talking about
just using bots in a laboratory setting
sort of to to study how they play and to

[2:57:45]
sort of to to study how they play and to
create a more accurate solver map
started doing stuff like this a couple
years ago and it was sort of the same
thing where like I had an initial idea
and I took it to a certain extent and

[2:58:01]
and I took it to a certain extent and
then a bunch of other people took that
idea and developed it further
and then showed me ways that they
expanded on my work and I had another
like oh [ __ ] moment like I've missed a
lot of stuff and now I'm going back and

[2:58:15]
lot of stuff and now I'm going back and
expanding on that further so those are
some of the things that I'm interested
in right now
how do you see the the future of Poker
I was already I'm generally your wizard
you know yeah I'm generally optimistic

[2:58:31]
you know yeah I'm generally optimistic
about it
uh
especially tournaments
I I think that cash games
are going to depend a little bit more on
U.S regulations

[2:58:46]
U.S regulations
and also regulations in Europe too I'm
not as familiar with that since I don't
live there but I know that there are a
lot of countries with like
pretty prohibitive tax rates on gambling
that are making things really difficult

[2:59:00]
that are making things really difficult
in the United States I think um
I'm not an expert on this either Phil
gal fund I think has the best content on
social media so I would suggest people
go watch his videos about the future of
Regulation and online poker but um I

[2:59:16]
Regulation and online poker but um I
think basically the key takeaway is that
like
a lot of stuff is going to hinge on
whether California legalizes online
poker because they're like they were
like 50 of the market online in the US
before Black Friday

[2:59:33]
um I think there's seven states in the
U.S now that have legalized it so it's
exciting I hope that these sites keep
opening up and the U.S states keep
um as far as like game Integrity I'm

[2:59:47]
um as far as like game Integrity I'm
pretty optimistic about that I don't
think that RTA and cheating is as big of
a problem as people generally make it
out to be and so it's kind of going to
just depend on legislation I think and

[3:00:02]
just depend on legislation I think and
um you know how many people are just
playing poker
so all factors that are outside of our
control or as a boat Community you think
we can contribute to it in a certain way
so it falls to the outcome that we want

[3:00:17]
I really don't know that's a good
question
I personally I don't think I'd really do
anything to influence
regulation or legislation

[3:00:30]
regulation or legislation
um
and I'm not sure how one would go about
doing that so I wouldn't want to say
that it's impossible though that you
know people could make a difference in
the politics of it all Phil Golfland for
president
yeah maybe that helps

[3:00:48]
yeah maybe that helps
um what would you like
the main takeaway from our conversation
today before our audience
obviously we touched on various topics

[3:01:04]
I think uh
than the mental health discussion that
we had in the beginning is really
important and to just circle back to
that and make sure that people don't uh
forget about that to

[3:01:16]
forget about that to
destigmatize that and take it more
seriously I think
it's probably the most important thing
uh that we discussed today and
um you know everything else
it it is just a job at the end of the

[3:01:30]
it it is just a job at the end of the
day if you even want to call poker a job
um so it's it's really not that
important
um in the grand scheme of things
and poker

[3:01:45]
and poker
if we're talking about the technical
side it's not just one thing there's no
shortcut I mean we just talked about
so many different things and Concepts
and ways to approach the game
hard work is obviously super important
but to not look for shortcuts I think is

[3:02:02]
but to not look for shortcuts I think is
really important just to expect that
it's going to be difficult and you're
going to have to outwork other people if
you want to succeed
all right wise words any final questions
from you Adam

[3:02:15]
from you Adam
no all good thank you very much for your
time Patrick very very insightful I'll
definitely listen back to this myself
and take a lot of notes so we appreciate
you spending the last three hours with
us
thanks for having me on
thanks a lot Mr Patrick Howard for

[3:02:30]
thanks a lot Mr Patrick Howard for
dropping your wisdom here on the
mechanics of Poker podcast thank you
very much Adam what are your main
takeaways of today's pod
yeah it was a great conversation Patrick
going very deep into his mental health
which I thought was very uh interesting

[3:02:45]
which I thought was very uh interesting
and it showed a lot of vulnerability
which I think a lot of players could
relate to and yeah some of the things
that came up there were the challenges
of being a poker player the isolation
the long night time hours the financial
pressure and the Springs you're under
and often as poker players we can

[3:03:01]
and often as poker players we can
struggle to experience our emotions and
what a feel so we'll suppress stuff
we'll distract ourselves and we'll find
Outlets to uh stop ourselves having a
deal with emotions and as we saw for
Patrick's story and I hear this again
with other players as well it often

[3:03:16]
with other players as well it often
comes out in other ways and often you
can suppress it for so long and then
there's a breaker point then there's a
point where you need to address it so I
yeah I think it was really good to bring
the conversation forward to give players
also some like understanding that you're
not alone on this journey you're also a

[3:03:30]
not alone on this journey you're also a
lot of players struggle with these
things and he has some really good tips
on first of all getting your lifestyle
back in in tandem sort of sleeping well
actually eyes and well you mentioned
some practical things like taking
therapy or on medication for him
personally when he went deep into his

[3:03:46]
personally when he went deep into his
mental health and then yeah just
basically trying to reach out to people
and have other perspectives on your
situation and realizing you're not
learning your journey uh see I think
that was really really powerful other
things we went into were cognitive
biases I found that part of the
conversation very fascinating myself in

[3:04:00]
conversation very fascinating myself in
terms of the things that players think
are strategic licks but actually come
from mental leaks this can be from
emotions cause and mental leaks or it
can be being too passive in nature which
leads you to strategically make a lot of
thoughts and areas you wouldn't and yeah
often these kind of devices come from

[3:04:16]
often these kind of devices come from
blind spots blind spots that I'm not
aware of and the brand taking shortcuts
so Patrick mentioned a book called uh
thinking in systems also thinking fast
and slow which is a great book to uh get
a kind of understand of how biases work
and build some Frameworks but yeah

[3:04:30]
and build some Frameworks but yeah
really really good stuff around how the
brain works and yeah that was a really
good conversation about the challenges
of being a poker player we went deep on
some areas and so the Dark Side of being
a poker player which sometimes we don't
really talk about so I think it was good
to bring that to the the four friends
how about yourself Renee what was some

[3:04:46]
how about yourself Renee what was some
of the the main takeaways for you yeah I
wrote that at some point I wrote down
few with with like an exclamation point
as well that we should not get lost in
distractions and we should be observing
why we're from what kind of emotions
we're distracting ourselves and how that

[3:05:00]
we're distracting ourselves and how that
Loop looks I think I also explained like
oh I feel in a certain way therefore I
start to do a certain thing and it's
very easy to just distract yourself with
alcohol very common uh kind of a bit of
a toxic look you drink too much
therefore you sleep less after a few

[3:05:15]
therefore you sleep less after a few
more stress therefore you need more
alcohol which is kind of a vicious cycle
uh what else alcohol for example for me
as well personally caffeine just
anything that makes me feel different
smoking porn whatever I over everything
that is like a distraction and that's

[3:05:30]
that is like a distraction and that's
like stimulates your brain and that
takes you away from how you actually
feel if you start to eliminate those and
really get in touch with how you feel I
think it's very important now this
doesn't mean that oh I don't feel
motivated today so I'm gonna lay on the
couch no you can feel motivated and
still do things it's not like you're

[3:05:45]
still do things it's not like you're
going to be a slave of your emotion but
it's it is important to use your
emotions as almost like a compass in a
certain way especially
certain emotions if they keep on coming
back it's probably a good idea to start
addressing those uh I also tried to

[3:06:00]
addressing those uh I also tried to
steer the conversation I was talking
about this with Adam infused so
insignificant when you talk about poker
after you've just talked about topics
that are very important like the mental
health but you know obviously we are a
book about this I know I'm personally
interested and I know a lot of listeners
are interested in as well we talk a lot

[3:06:15]
are interested in as well we talk a lot
about uh GTO and hand to note and the
Aus and how there's no one side or the
other we talked about how both are very
valuable in the process of strategy
creation we talked also a lot on the
focus on recreational players

[3:06:31]
focus on recreational players
recreational players they tend to have
huge loss rates compared to regulars so
your Roi how much you get back for the
amount you put in for studying is
usually way greater than if you study
other regulars for example it feels

[3:06:45]
other regulars for example it feels
intellectually less challenging and you
already think like well I already know
how to win against recreational players
but that's not the point you want to
maximize win even more and that's
usually a very good area where you can
gain a bigger Edge
another thing that we touched on was

[3:07:02]
another thing that we touched on was
about being smart about taking shots
like The Compound Effect of taking shots
is really huge and there's ways to take
shots more effectively or be smarter
about the shots that you take and we

[3:07:15]
about the shots that you take and we
gave I think a lot of good advice on
that as well so yeah great pot we're
gonna wrap it up I want to thank Patrick
