what's up my fellow poker enthusiasts
it's Renee aka the weko here and
together with my co-host Adam Carmichael
we present to you the mechanics of Poker
podcast in this podcast we deconstruct
high stakes poker players figuring out
what it is about them how they think
what they do that makes them so
successful with an extra focus on the
obstacles they faced and the skills they
had to develop to surpass them over the
years me and Adam have gained a lot of
experience in both reaching high stakes
poker ourselves and teaching other
players to do the same we have bundled
all this knowledge together in our
coaching program the mechanics of Poker
which is the most complete poker
coaching product on the market if you
want to have a chance to work with me
and Adam so you can get unstuck and make
more progress in your poker career go
over to mechanics of poker.com to apply
but without further Ado let's learn from
another high stakes players journey in
today's episode welcome back to the
mechanics of Poker podcast today we will
have a chat with high stakes poker
player Kion Kion mock mokri Kion worked
his way up playing online and live cash
games but got a big boost in bankroll
when he managed to chop the 10K scoop
main event which allowed him to settle
down at the highest Stakes permanently
he more recently also got involved maybe
that's also where you might have seen
his name in the live poker scene and not
without results he had a great trip to
the Bahamas at the start of the Year
Final Table in three events and hitting
100K mystery Bounty afterwards he also
Final Table to the Triton 250k and more
recently becoming fourth second and
finally first playing the high roads at
EBT Barcelona the thing that Kaya
mentioned that sets him apart from the
rest of the players is his lack of fear
and the ability to take risks which we
will dive deeper in during this
conversation
as always I'm joined with my co-host
co-mechanics of Poker coach Mr mindset
and performance Adam Carmichael Adam I'm
curious is being Fearless something you
either have or don't or is it trainable
in European
that's a good question I think how we
feel fear and respond to fear is
somewhat based on our character traits
and it's somewhat defiant however how we
perceive that fear and how we deal with
fear is very much trainable in my
opinion so you're very interested to
dive into Kanye's story today he's
someone who identifies as a Fearless
person who takes risks so we'll dive
into what he's been able to learn from
his own Pursuits and some lessons that
the audience can go away with in terms
of their own ability to take on more
risk so it's more your perspective and
how you label the fear that kind of
determines the action that you take
correct yeah I think everything's
malleable and the fear is almost like
how we feel in turning our body how we
perceive that by the mind will then
magnify or lessen that and how we deal
with that fear is based on that
interpretation of that and whether we
move into the fear or move away there's
still a massive Choice point there to to
work with so yeah be interesting to see
how Cayenne relates to this whether he
has fear at all maybe he's just one of
those guys who doesn't feel the fear
response therefore he's got nothing to
work with but most of us feel fear and
we need to figure out ways to step into
it very curious indeed before we start

let's get into today's episode all right
Kion
hello hello thank you for coming on the
pub man it's a pleasure it's a pleasure
and I I believe uh I first got familiar
with you a couple years ago I was doing
Twitch streaming on the 5000 Zoom
streets and I was regularly playing
against you I remember from what I
recall you were a player who would not
give up the pots without a fight
and I was curious like has this
aggressive style always been your
natural inclination towards playing the
game or is it something that you
learned through working your way up or
to maybe studying the game that this was
a good approach
yeah so I remember those times those
were good times it was like right before
covet or right after I'm not sure yeah I
remember coming into your stream
trolling and writing some comments and
things yeah actually recall yesterday
that is like my Mo like write things in
chat and have fun at the tables yeah no
I am
almost forgot the question yeah no you
know I've always been a guy who's like
learning by doing preferably playing by
against better players and the and I
found out like being a more aggressive
than like more passive is like the
better route to go because you learn a
lot of like things when you're being
aggressive you see where like people's
Tendencies are you see where they're
afraid of calling or Not Afraid but just
like you can use like a lot of bluff
spots where people overfold a lot and
like you can use that to your advantage
because you when you're in the same
situation you can fold more and like my
whole strategy on 500 Zoom was redlining
like basically I was losing
on Blue Line and winning on Redline
because people are just like
automatically playing like all the
faults and playing too tight you know
like because they knew they had some
recreational like pumped all the stack
after anyway like it was probably not
the best approach and I wouldn't do that
today but at that time right after covet
times it really seemed to work out very
well except for like against Bonk who
would overcome it David Jones because
these guys were aware that I was doing
this but all in all it was a strategy
that would work well at that point
like I wasn't doing very well at the 500
Zoom because people were just
overfolding for some reason and it
wouldn't stop
and you never had this quote quote
problem yourself that you were naturally
leaning towards because it's a it's a
general pool tendency to overfold and
under aggress but you seem to not
struggle with that was that like
something that ever since you started
playing poker came natural to you or did
you was it really like a strategical
adjustment like hey I believe you know
this is kind of what the pool's doing so
let me let me actually be very
aggressive
so the thing is I started playing at
poker like I would say
so I was playing as a recreational as a
student around 2015 like I was playing
like let's say weekly and I was a
student and I was playing very Splash
you know like live games you know we're
being aggressive like was like almost uh
you had to be like you were you had to
fight for parts and there was a lot of
freestyling and this and this and that
so I think after a while I just
understood like people's pair of money
and losing money just like became like a
thing I wanted to exploit as much as
possible because especially like deep in
tournaments you can see like people play
very differently when it comes to like
because a lot of players say that like
the money doesn't go to their head but
100 surely it doesn't because it even
does with me and I'm like maybe like not
that afraid of losing money but it still
like affects everyone like if you have a
big piece of yourself or you're playing
like a very big game that's very big to
you and so basically I'm just trying to
like
use like a strategic Advantage by like
finding out where people are weak and
not and just try to use that to my
advantage as much as possible maybe it
became like a big like uh we'll just say
like in general like in the 500 example
this is how it worked and this is how I
do it I could have maybe adjusted more
against other opponents but like yeah so
this just became like my way of playing
for many years like I would say from
2018 until
mid-2021 I was playing over aggressive
I'm probably still playing like a bit
too aggressive but like
it's way I can give up Bluffs now but at
that time I wouldn't give up Bluffs like
yeah you you you've added more Nuance
you you pumped enough in spots where
like I think this spot though maybe I
should stop punting here basically
yeah basically and you played a lot with
me so you understand like I'm gonna take
my spots and I'm gonna find Bluffs where
most people don't you know I'm just
gonna play but now I've been like
I've been working a lot on my games
Tim's covid but at during coven when I
was playing 500 Zoom it didn't help me
that much like using solvers that much
because people are just doing the same
they wouldn't like move on they would
just you had these uh typical regs I'm
not sure if I should name names but like
maybe for example if you remember that
guy he was just like never block and
just call too much okay so you know you
can just make a few adjustments that was
basically just overfolding and over
bluffing like for like I would say two
and a half years of my career
which is uh I would say is a good
strategy basically whenever people show
weakness you attack a lot and whenever
they show interest in the pot you're
like hey
yeah basically yeah yeah I actually
remember I don't know if you remember
but when I started streaming I had
various text various colors and people
were always trying to debate like what
the texts were and I remember you were
the purple yeah
listen if this guy sticks money in the
pods don't try to rationalize it too
much just be like this guy probably
shows up with something funky [ __ ] it I
mean
yeah I remember asking about this
perfect tag maybe like 10 times and you
would never tell me we're good exactly
but at some point people were like some
people made it sort of their job to kind
of figure out and they slowly start to
see patterns like hey this did this
second like a Kenyan guy and mokry guy
they all have like the same text it's
like okay yeah sancti has the same tag
the other guy has the same text like
okay yeah they have certain tendencies
that make me tag them a certain way yeah
that was the thing I remember I think it
was sanctity who had the same tag or
something there's some guy I really yeah
you were like you were you were a bit
you were offended like why the [ __ ]
yeah I was like baby yeah I'm not
expecting like a top top uh best friend
color but I'm like come on man yeah it
wasn't tagged on uh it wasn't like
tagged on ranking or anything it was
just like certain tendencies that would
lead me to attack a player a certain
color so that it's you know when I see
when I see blue when I see purple when I
see yellow there's a automatic sort of
train of thought that goes into my head
like oh this guy's purple and then it's
kind of an accumulated way of okay this
guy's purple so he probably you know
approaches the game in a certain way
I do the exact same thing like I have
certain tags on people who have like
their Tendencies which I think though
it's not like it's that way but it's
something I think and how they perceive
me as a player you know because I I I'm
very well aware of my image many people
don't think so but I'm very like well
aware of what people think about me you
know so when they think I over Bluff too
much I'm probably just gonna like
without them even realizing I'm just
gonna like adjust all the time you know
so
it's actually a very good style
especially if you play in a pool that's
overly passive you'll naturally be very
aggressive but then there's a couple
guys who approach the game a bit more
like you as well and they also fight
more footballs and if you can spot those
then your image actually can play in
your favor if you you know change some
things up in your strategy
yeah so especially in live poker you
notice you noticed very quickly Who's
Who and who's doing what and who's not
doing this and who's like talking to you
and who which way they're talking to you
know you can get a lot of information
I'm always friendly at the table trying
to talk to everybody you know but like
it's not like I do it for strategic
Reasons I'm just doing it to keep myself
like entertained and like try to have
fun you know if for me if it isn't fun
I'm not being I couldn't sit there for
like 12 hours playing day one of the
like 5K Main Event it would crush my
soul so if I can't have fun I'm probably
not gonna do it anymore either you know
yeah and I think especially also we
heard there's actually a lot throughout
various guests uh that we had done on
the part who said yeah especially
recreational players they're there to
have fun so part of your job is also to
have fun with them right if they don't
have funds like you said if if I don't
have fun I don't even bother so a lot of
players have the same mentality so then
if no one has fun at the table then
people stop showing up which is
obviously not great
thing though like I
private games all over my like up in my
career and like if everybody's drinking
and if everybody's straddling and you're
like one of the few Pros you know what
you have to do you follow the line you
just do the same thing because like if
you're there to sit in like ground like
grind out last EV of every single spot
it's
you know people are not interested in
playing with those types of people the
thing about me is I've always been able
to adjust to like make people like you
and be life at the table some people
just might actually not like having me
there at all you know because I can be I
can be like very like talkative and like
maybe it's annoying even you know I'm a
polarizing right if you put yourself out
there if you have a strong character
there there will always be people who
get who dislike that
yeah obviously and this you know this is
uh this is the thing like you can't be
liked by everybody and you gotta like
try to make it fun for you and for them
and try to make it enjoyable for
everybody you know that's the point of
Poker you like recreationals are not
coming there to try and win every pod
they're trying to have fun learn the
game you know and they think it's fun to
play with Pros for giving them like the
attention kind of in a like if you know
what I mean like it's not like you can
if they ask you about hands and what do
you have you can just show them and tell
them like they want to see those things
you know and I don't mind at all you
know this is this has been always my
like
I think best quality as a poker player
like
I I'm not that serious all the time it's
like when I'm playing online against the
best breaks I'm probably not going to do
the same but you know what I mean it's
like yeah you you you understand how to
read the environment and adjust to the
environment like a chameleon you know
you blend in nicely you you provide yeah
would like to see you provide you you
actually mentioned this as one of your
qualities that actually set you apart
you mentioned that from other players
which is being a nice guy and fun to be
around and to play with and you also
mentioned that you don't care or look
for small edges everywhere as that can
hurt you in the long run right like they
did something that you mentioned I'm
curious like how does that how has that
benefited in your career and how can pay
layers acquire these skills
so so the thing is it's like it's not
like I'm trying to do this this is just
how I am as a person you know I'm I've
always been like very including and just
like trying to be nice to everyone and
like you know just make it fun for
everyone because this is why we play
poker okay we play to make a living yes
but we also play started playing the
game because it was fun you know you
have to go back to the roots and if you
can't keep this same motivation about
something or like
do it the way you used to do it you're
going to get bored pretty quick you know
if everything is all about strategy and
just like exploiting your opponent for
0.1 BB you know it's just
I mean this is not what I especially in
live poker I'm talking specifically
about live poker now you know if you're
playing like very tough games yes you
have to compete and yes they're
strategic and you have to be like very
focused yes but I'm talking like sports
specifically about live games where
you're trying to have fun and the way
this has benefited me is like people
want me in their games you know because
okay everybody starts drinking everybody
starts straddling oh they want to change
the game to Five Card PLO or whatever
I'm always in you know
in the beginning I was torching money in
this game you know I was just torching
but I was winning in the No Limit game
so I was just like giving action on both
ways you know this is just to like
make it more fair you know like a fair
playground you know it's like
let's say a professional basketball
player is like
playing with one hand against a guy is
recreational if they're playing about
money basically you know what I mean
no yeah I I I get what you mean and I
can definitely see how this
definitely in the shorter might cost you
maybe something people in the long term
it will definitely gain you a lot of VP
but I think the main takeaway here is
that maybe we should stop thinking about
EV all the time and also think about
maybe the bigger picture that's kind of
the message that I think you're trying
to tell yes correct I'm trying I've
always been that guys trying to see the
bigger picture you know I see all of
these guys using like hours and hours in
solvers and I've always been like the
guy who's been like okay what is the
best way to learn it's like by doing
something in practice right okay you're
gonna lose a little bit of money in this
lineup for sure but imagine how much
you're going to learn you know this is
like the Philadelphia strategy of how he
learned poker back in the days I don't
know if you follow him on Twitter but he
said a lot of things about this he used
to battle like players he maybe knew was
better than him or at least put it up as
an advice because you learn a lot of
like
things maybe the solvers can't teach you
like where they deviate and where it's
good to deviate and where it is too good
to use like a basic knowledge of the
solver you know what I mean yeah it's
also very different if you see something
in a solver or you're being put in a
situation by someone right it has the
complete experience you see the hand you
sort of see what the solver does
and but you also have the experience of
like oh this is a pretty annoying
situation to be in or like oh this guy
owned me pretty hard here what's going
on so you have the full experience it's
like 4D instead of 2D yes correct and
then it's like okay uh solvers are good
for like
purpose of like understanding why it
doesn't like uh in the equivalent
equilibrium or whatever and then yeah of
course it's a great tool but I I see
like I don't know how many guys I've
talked to from like let's say Norway or
all over the world and they're just like
sitting there playing like 100 zoom and
they're like trying to implement like
deep solver strategies and you know
what's the most dangerous thing about
this is like they don't know how the
strategy actually works in fully they
tried to use one part of it there and
they're not sure to what do on turn and
rivers you know you know what I mean
yeah they they they just execute
something on the Flop or on the turn
without thinking about okay for example
a hand can take a certain line on the
flop because it has certain benefits on
how you then can play Turn River but if
they just copy the Flop and then on the
turn they butcher it then like okay well
if you're gonna do this on turn or river
then maybe maybe you should not play the
flop in this way because part of the
view of this flop play is what you do on
the river that's kind of what you're
saying yeah and instead of like using
simplified strategies and then learning
from that instead and see how people
react by so I don't know if you remember
like let's say 2020 early 2020 it was
like
people were using a lot of one-thirds
you know a lot like a lot nobody was
over betting flop no I was plotting the
Flop nobody was betting big and checking
it was like a lot of like from third
sizing I don't know you remember this
right yeah yeah yeah this was like a
very big thing and then once people
started realizing like they came back
big and check the problem has become
like many players just like that's big
with their entire range and said what
they don't understand is like you're
supposed to check sometimes this is what
makes this strategy good like again the
fact that you get in the check line yeah
yeah you know you have like this much
check and this much big that people just
tend to like oh I've learned this people
do this I'm gonna do this all the time
you know this is yeah
they learn a trick or two and they're
trying to be balanced but they're just
like not at all you know this is the
problem
yeah and especially like you should
always think about okay
what kind of consequence does my
strategy have to his range so for
example there's many strategies that can
be plus a v so let's say you do use a
strategy where you you open a lot for
for let's say you open a lot for members
and followed up with a lot of small
betting okay that means that it'll turn
River the range that we will face will
still be quite wide because you only
memorize free and you only met at small
on the Flop so being a bit more
aggressive on a later Street than
fighting for pots Bluff catching
bluffing it's going to be important
whereas if you open Forex and put every
flop then the range that you face on
Turner river is probably going to be a
bit more tighter so I would imagine less
significant overblocking so you could
use that strategy but then if you do
that your River fault should be higher
in the 4X pot then
on the meme race small bet then you
should obviously five more on the river
because this range is wider so this is
kind of like an example of consequence
of an earlier Street strategy
it can be good depending on how you play
the later Street correct it's not like
this strategy is better or this is
better or whatever it depends on like
your opponents and how well they adjust
and everything but this was what you
said there was basically my strategy
throughout 500 Zoom I was
I had 85 percent see bet on flop or
something something crazy and then I had
like I would say 66 continue on terms
for like 75 or over bets you know and
this was just like because their their
range was so wide when they called The
Flop one third and you would just like
win a lot of immediate and they would
more or less raised too much when they
had it and when they didn't have it you
could just like
yeah they were playing very capped on
Vlog most of the time you know some
players were not obviously some players
yeah some players were like hey this is
Kaya mokry Let's uh let's look a little
bit more you know but like again this is
like okay you might then donate some
money here and there but the correct
strategy versus a very aggressive
strategy like the one you're explaining
is very hard to execute because usually
if you would not locked in and solver it
says fault zero well nobody nobody folds
zero right no no yeah significantly over
Bluffs oh full zero yeah
still you see people folding so the the
correct counter exploit is not made
yes the thing is you still have to put
money in the pot you know people are
like they put their emotions through
their money you know it's like
it's still money you know they they see
like uh let's say when you're playing NL
10K you're losing a car if you lose a
stack you know it's like it's not small
money still have to put money in the pot
you know and that's the that's the thing
people are are trying to be as robotic
as possible but still there are emotions
like you see like the richest guys they
they tend to have like a very well
balanced thing like money control when
it comes to this leave their emotions
out but if you see a new guy just start
playing these things like you can Hammer
hard on this guy you know it's like the
new kid on the street and
let's see how comfortable he is when I
put him to a decision for a nice car
let's see let's see and then and then
the hero coach was like okay well this
guy this guy's earned my respect
yeah it's like it's like very polarized
in this thing either they're just gonna
call you down no matter what or they're
just gonna fold too much and play a bit
tighter you know what I mean it's like
it's very rarely in the middle but it's
like usually one or the other it's also
the thing like I know you also play uh
some heads up but in a ring game it's
also let's say for example I would play
in a game that's very big and maybe not
the most comfortable but I have to play
the game because I don't know let's say
there's a couple recreationals but then
you're also at the table then it's very
easy to also the guy and it's kind of
over aggressive [ __ ] it I'll just fold
and wait for my hand against the other
recreational player right
it's the easy way of living you know
it's it's like like people are
so the thing is like the human like for
humans mostly they like to live
comfortably you know everything is like
all about comfort and you know if you
know by like 100 certainty like if I
fall against this guy I'm gonna get his
stacked probably by the end of the night
they're still gonna do the book If you
do 100 but some sometimes you have the
ego thing like oh I'm so annoyed I'm I
don't want to get pushed around anymore
I just got to get them you know these
things matter I know people say they
don't mostly because most people won't
admit it but these things really do
matter like okay this guy Bluffs too
much now I'm done with it I'm gonna get
him you know
and it doesn't matter what Moki was
thinking in terms of oh I'm gonna put
into a decision or I did blah blah he's
just like oh this is probably frequency
call let me frequency call move on you
know that is a bit more Focus moving
where life is still very much uh
yes correct and when you're playing
online poker you're playing against
you're playing against top
0.1 players in the world probably even
less like
I would say most of the 200 Zoom ranks
are like
top 0.5 players in the world like maybe
even maybe 0.2 these guys are getting so
good all of them like they're getting
very good
so this is like then for example maybe
if you put them in a in a live
environment where there's more chaos
then maybe you know their strategies
fall apart because this was an
interesting point that actually I wanted
to touch on because the modern day trend
is more like okay poker is very complex
right and yeah the solution is let's
simplify the game tree let's simplify
everything so we can make it a bit more
aggressable where you are way more you
it feels like you Embrace way more this
complexity and kind of embrace the chaos
uh and play way more of a complex
strategy so I would just say how are you
able to execute a complex strategy and
what in your opinion are kind of the ups
and maybe also downsides of of this
approach
so the thing is when I'm playing online
let's say I'm playing like a
three-handed game 25 50 or whatever I'm
gonna start playing like as close to
good as I know you know like there are
certain things that I don't know there
are certain things other players don't
know you know I do use my time in
solvers I'm not like uh
complete freestyler but the
the comparison is like the online games
are very tough if you're playing against
very very very good players who have
been studying a lot who has you know
they've tried and they've played so many
hands you know they have the experience
so the difference is like I tried to
play as well as I can like closer to the
game tree when I'm playing online while
I'm playing live I'm trying to like okay
where is this guy is this guy is super
professional is this guy like a
mid-stakes ring you know it's like you
put them in like categories you know who
is this guy what is he gonna do how is
he gonna react how is he how does he
like uh see me do it does he think I'm
too aggressive does he think I'm too
tight or you know is he just kidding
around you know this this is the thing
you gotta like in life you gotta kind of
find out who's who and you have these
super serious guys live as well
especially in the high rollers these
guys are so good man they're just so
good and then you have to try to play as
good as possible but you know
I'm trying to compete and I've always
enjoyed it and uh I think by by doing
this
I'm learning like way quicker than most
people this has been like you you learn
way quicker you just you see what
they're doing and you adapt and you just
like oh maybe because the thing is I
tried to not criticize plays before I
kind of understand how they work you
know maybe this is something I could
implement or this is something I
shouldn't Implement you know this is so
it's like a lot of learning by doing and
basically I was battling David Jones and
nacho for a long while on 25 50 and 51
and you know I got crushed by David by
David Jones especially he just crushed
me like he really did he just destroyed
me in the 300 format he was just way
better than them and from the 500 Zoom
days he was still just way better than
the rest it was just always been very
good and
I think he has something on me and he
just knows like
how to adjust against me very well
especially him I would say
so would you say and then say this is
also a quality that you see in like
better players that they just you have a
certain game and like you said
everyone's game is flawed in a certain
way and maybe he understands the flaw in
your game that maybe you don't
understand and he capitalized on that
and that's kind of what sets better
players apart
yeah so the thing is
I have to say I played against I didn't
play that much against minus but I
played some and I played a lot with
David Johnson a lot and I would say
those two guys just like know how to
adapt very well you know there's like
and I play button clicker heads up too
and that guy the same thing like they
just know you know it played so many
hands and they just know how things work
and they've seen my I'm assuming they've
seen my player types so much they're
just like use like a very like
let's say General strategy like I would
do on fire on Zoom against me
I I would say I had more of those leaks
before
like maybe a year ago but since then
I've been just like trying to work a lot
on my game because I I was noticing I
was struggling a bit on the highest
Stakes so the last let's say six months
one year I've been working a lot on my
game and trying to like okay
if I really want to compete both online
and live I kind of gotta
step on your game in certain areas I was
getting lazy and entitled and like you
know I was getting very lazy I must say
I was getting very entitled I was
getting attention and I was you know and
yeah I made it now you know I'm here
yeah yeah that's the thing you know I
and the thing is like I I did very well
in a couple of tournaments which has
like boosted my
uh let's say financial situation a lot
which compared to many cash regs they
they just grinded it up like I grounded
it up too just like them honestly I
really did and then I got but I jumped
like through the stages quicker I would
say because of those like tournament
scores but you know I mean there is some
luck in this but like yeah if you play
enough tournaments you're gonna get like
the EV from that too
I mean it's also interesting that you
mentioned like okay when I play a tough
lineup online you try to play more like
like the solver game tree but that's
also because
the better your opponent is the the more
solver considerations become relevant
right and I feel like in your decision
making this is something that a lot of
players get wrong and this is something
that you do very well and I guess that's
also how you transition well between
online life the first thing you have to
ask yourself is oh who am I up against
because depending on the answers that
question your train of thoughts should
go either down One Direction or the
other if if you're indeed up like like
against a GTO whisket then by all means
follow the solver but
often that's not the case so then you
have to ask yourself more well I know
how Theory works like I said there is a
little value in that understanding and
solver and sending out Theory works but
then it's way more I understand how
Theory works this guy is screwing up
either too much to the left or the right
and I should now start adjusting right
that's kind of what you're what you're
explaining and something that you say
that maybe especially at the lower stake
Zoom boost people who are just following
the solver too much and not really
thinking about these type of things
yeah so Master dog has said this before
I remember watching some of his videos
that guy's an absolute troll by the way
let's see
Patrol but I I find it very amusing but
uh yeah so he said like
I remember him saying like Okay you can
try to play Australia that you don't
know how it works or you can try to
simplify against weaker opponents and
just like earn the most money in every
situation or the way you know is the
most money because more often I wouldn't
say more often than not but I mean say
if you're playing against very weak
players and those things you just like
simplify you know because they're
they're just gonna pray like very weak
compared to you and like yeah my point
is just like people are very like oh
solvers also this this that the blah
blah blah yes the solver is very
important I'm not saying it's not I'm
just saying like there are many
situations where you're just like
not doing the best thing and by not
doing the best thing and trying to play
like a server will mean also that you
forget to exploit you know like
exploiting is a big part of Poker still
you know even in 2023 it's a big part of
Poker yeah it's in my opinion it's kind
of the thought process that you go down
if you work a lot solvers your thought
process is often led by I have to now do
this or they say something what do I
have to do and then they think about
what would the solver do but the first
thing you have to take consideration
well what the [ __ ] what what kind of
range am I actually up against let's not
think about that what the [ __ ] does this
guy actually have and then actually what
to do well then come quite naturally
based on huh I think he's quite strong
here or I think it's quite weaker or huh
maybe I should just bet very big with
this hand in my vacuum because I'm
playing as a guy who's you know clearly
approaching the game different than a
solver
exactly you know it's just like I think
people are just trying to feed
Migos by like oh this album did this so
I'll do the same and then they go in and
the guy is like probably drunk on a
Saturday night playing 200 zoom and he's
yeah he's gonna call you down you know
and you're bluffing stuff
oh I played again no you did not you
know you didn't see yeah yeah you did
it's you're only isolated the piece of
the information in a puzzle that's way
bigger than the actual piece you focused
on which was well I have the best
unblockers I have the best blockers
let's go where the puzzle is a little
bit bigger
I mean yeah I mean
honestly like the best best players in
the world are the guys who like have a
very good 50 50 bounce of this you know
like I I've said this before like this
these guys when I talked about like
Davey and Linus and Barack as well is so
good like and for a long time I thought
he was like very tight but guys the kid
is just brilliant you know he's just
very smart and he understands these
things like and these guys understand
these things because they see like the
bigger picture did they think about
different things they take different
things in consideration at different
weights then you are taking in
consideration
exactly you know and if you're gonna
become like the best best player in the
world you gotta like use uh like it's
got to be finesse you know it's like
okay solver is one thing but what about
this you know people overhold here even
though the solver always calls you know
it's just like because they people think
they think they under blood fear and
they're using like these like General
thoughts and like how people perceive
the game
in their advantage you know and this is
what they're supposed to do they just
they're just like yeah like I said
seeing the bigger picture
generating more like that yeah and
generating more money and like more EV
in like yeah and honestly there's it's
super smart that's that's how it's
supposed to be I mean there is a there
is let's say for example you start and
at some point the solver can definitely
help boost your game but then there's a
phase beyond the solver sort of yes
which you have to reach which at some
point you have to just let go
not everybody can't remember what the
solver does 100 of the time it's not
possible it is literally impossible to
do play as a song even in chess these
guys like you have magnets like the best
player in the world like do you just
he confuses people you know in the
beginning because he just plays like
something they're like they're like
confused they don't know about this
because they studied probably something
else and then he just puts them out of
their comfort zone like putting people
out of their comfort zone is like where
you're gonna see them at their lowest
most of the time so then like Stefan is
like the magnets of Poker like oh dude
Stefan oh don't get me started on this
guy oh my God this guy just
I I mean I mean I don't know how many
times I play with this guy but every
time I'm done I needed an aspirin
all over the place the sky is just and I
played some heads up with this guy and
he's just all over the place man he just
has like 15 different moves but
honestly I would say the guy is pretty
smart he does that yes he just puts
people out of their like comfort zone
and just and he's been trying these
things for years you know he knows how
people react and how he's gonna counter
react you know
but yeah you know if you meet him in the
right wrong mood the guy is just the
Beast you know he's just gonna be like
playing very well and he's yeah like he
is like a super exploit but knows Theory
guy he's like yeah yeah he so so he he
was here then the theory helped him and
he went beyond but he went beyond beyond
yeah he's yeah that guy's I would almost
say crazy I don't know but I do not want
to live I mean the line between crazy
and Brilliant you know yeah yeah it's a
thin line yeah I think I saw a video of
one of these YouTube channels the other
day because like he showed a hand played
at 10 NL and then they were making fun
of but then but then he suddenly said
but actually this was a hand not played
a 10-0 but at 40K now and now suddenly
it became an interesting hit where I
said no you thought what the [ __ ] are
these guys just dunking around
and then was something amazing
no no I think it was
um either this uh two card confidence I
think or the uh the finding equilibrium
one of the two that make made like this
this comparison
I think the main thing was that the the
antenna you can see the same hand the
tenant was 40 KNL but the difference is
obviously the the reasoning or the
thoughts that went behind the hand
okay yeah so it's like it looks like
it's in the nail head yeah but he did a
great edit so definitely shout out uh
maybe I can put the link somewhere or
something I thought it was very well
done it's like suddenly the
transformation but this was actually at
40 KL but like it's quite interesting
like for example what Stefan doesn't
kind of Go full circle what we talked
about earlier if he if he used a certain
strategies that
make your range in a certain way that
you're no longer very much aware of what
the ranges are but he's perfectly aware
of what the ranges are and in the end if
you're very much aware of what the
ranges are you can make great decisions
so if you every time Maneuvers in a way
that he knows you're a range and his
range perfectly and you have no [ __ ]
clue what you're doing like I said you
need an aspirin uh the chances are quite
big that you will screw up and not him
because he knows
yeah I remember being at the Bahamas I
just like played some I think I just
made fourth in the like the 25k so I had
like a lot of stars balance you know and
then suddenly I still stay upon in the
10K Lobby headset and I've been
practicing my heads Up game for a long
time you know I've been babbling like
against the best this is how I've been
learning heads up this is by then I was
like okay you know what I'm gonna I'm
gonna place that phone a little bit you
know and we go railroad crazy man we
play for
10 hours straight I'm sitting there in
my on my MacBook like in at the Bahamas
playing Stefan and we're just writing
[ __ ] to each other on the chat and we're
just going back and forth and blah blah
blah
and then he just at the end he gets very
upset and just write something
so like the guy is just he just has 10
different moods like you know
I don't I don't know but he he's a super
funny character and I always enjoy
playing with him because you always have
to think you know it's not like this and
this and this and how I'm gonna
construct my rain and blah blah blah
it's like okay dude it's like you raise
the button he calls and the Flop is like
10 10 3 he just leads out one big blind
all of a sudden you can just leave that
one big one and you raise him and then
he insta clicks you back and you click
him and he clicks you you know it's just
like a freestyle show out of Dimensions
the guys and he makes it super fun to
play he's just like super humorous and
like yeah it's always fun to play with
him and even in six Max man it just
depends on which mood you get him you
know yeah so basically he has 10 10
different strategies and they're all
related to 10 different moods so he
wakes you off just puts his feet out of
the bed and like which mood am I in
today
and you don't and you know you can say a
lot of things about the guy but like all
of the strategies are like good like
it's not like
super just dust all over the place he's
just like he's really thinking you know
and he has already made up his mind kind
of he already knows what he's gonna do
and I think this comes from like he's
like an OG of the online streaks I would
say that yeah you have to learn this
there there's yeah he's definitely OG I
remember when I was uh maybe playing
High sexy I think he was just moving up
actually
yeah he's uh as I would say he is pretty
good yeah and and he's one of the like
you would say like it's not like Norm
you know yeah I think I think everyone
agrees that he's not the norm yes but he
is also one of the biggest winners on
six maps of all time I think if I'm not
mistaken is um yeah I think he's a
pretty intelligent guy let me just put
it like that yeah so unlike popular
advice which is usually nowadays no you
know you have to study population you
have to game select is you usually do
two very important things especially the
game selection one no you have online
poker stuff if you if you don't if
you're playing tough games you can't win
you clearly took a different advice uh a
different route right you said playing
against tough tough opponents you kind
of explain the benefits of that but in
order to jump in a game with Stefan
you need confidence right of course yeah
so
how does one gain the confidence to
decide to jump in those games
you know it's like all over my like
let's say low points and high points
it's always been all about like
competing and just trying to like evolve
like money comes and goes in a certain
way you can always make money this is
like the thing like gaining this
like getting
the confidence of playing like these
against these super good players is like
it comes from a way no it comes from a
place like okay what do I want do I want
to get better or do I want to like stay
in my Lane you know when do I want to
evolve when am I going to try you know
and if you don't try and fail you will
never get there you know it's like you
have to try and fail everybody's done it
I mean
if you look at the top 10 Pros in the
world right now they've probably tried
and failed many times you know you just
don't know it you think it's like been
all this it's probably been like all
around this too with them you know
and yeah you know I I was at some point
and I was like okay I think I can do it
and then I tried and
I failed miserably Maybe
I would say three four five times you
know even at the highest Stakes but then
I always took like okay I took a breath
and calmed down and I started over again
you know it's just like but at some
point you just started to stabilize
yourself you know you start at the end
you stabilize yourself you're like okay
this is what I what I did wrong that
time and now I'm not gonna do the same
mistake you know and you just learn from
every process you learn yeah so so it's
important the learn is important right
not not to just jump in not learn
anything jump in not learn anything
because this is not the way to approve
no it's like
I remember being like the guy who's like
everybody was like okay this guy's just
a punter blah blah blah I remember this
the these stages like at the highest
stage like people were thinking this
obviously and it was certainly true
because I was just doing like a lot of
minus EV things I was playing heads up
against button clicker flying llama you
know as like you know I was doing these
things but you know what this made me
good enough to beat other players now
you know and they would play me at the
same Stakes you understand what I mean
like okay I I gave away some EV but I
learned a [ __ ] ton and I got I got
friendly with them you know and they you
know and when you get friendly with
people they they tend to help you as
well and you try to help them and it's
like a two-way street yeah but you make
a relationship right relationships are
used
exactly and if you're being if you're
nice to people and they're nice to you
it's a friendship you know it's like uh
I would say that is a friendship and
maybe not like you're going to lunch
every day or every week but you know you
have a friendly environment and you have
good players and maybe they can learn
something from me instead also you know
like if we follow them like the the team
of what you what you've mentioned the
bigger picture in the end the quality of
your friendships kind of the qual
determined to a certain degree the
quality of your life and if you go very
big the end end goal is to have a good
life right so exactly you know and the
thing is if if we're both learning from
each other it's a quid pro quo and we're
both gaining something from each other
you know it this is a win-win people
have like and this is like a great thing
like having a good social network and
being liked and you know and having some
enemies too who knows you can't be liked
by everybody you know this is how how
the world works and you know it's the
thing is I think I've always been good
at like understanding what other people
do and implementing it myself you know I
I I don't I've never been a fan of books
I've never been a fan of like sitting in
the saw for five hours straight this is
not my thing like you know and if this
is not my thing I think
after a year or so I would be very bored
if I was sitting every day after session
two hours there three hours there you
know it's just gonna be too much for me
so instead of that I'm just like
chopping it down to like maybe half an
hour there half an hour there when I
have some spare time and
I talk poker with very good players you
know and hopefully they're learning
something for me too and maybe from the
live aspect I can learn them something
you know it it's a quick pro quo thing
man you know it's like
yeah this is also this is also how I see
the game like from learning against
the better players than me and mostly by
playing them
you know because most of the time
there's going to be one or two players
better or maybe not all of them you know
yeah so how much am I actually losing
here you know you know what I mean it's
like yeah especially if there's a big
spot at the table you're at least
guaranteed plus a fee and then you know
given if you lose some and then you can
learn against the other so you win
against him and you learn against the
other great situation and I'm losing now
you know maybe in a year I'm not losing
it against the same guy anymore you know
what I mean and that's because you're
playing in this game and I think often
especially the lower six I'm sure
there's a lot of players who listening
with quite some admiration because they
struggle themselves of trying to
accumulate the confidence to take
another step now usually what them
players do I would say they they feel
like a certain fear they try to prepare
away the fear or study away the fear
right gain more knowledge just to remove
that fear whereas you Embrace more to
fear you mentioned that I mean two
beliefs core beliefs that definitely
came back it's like abundance you said
you can always make money so losing the
money you have a clear belief listen
there's no scarcity there you can always
make money and you interpret failure as
an opportunity to learn and I would
always say you're interpreted it as a
necessity to learn I remember I think
there's a book I think I got this from a
book confidence Gap they say the Act of
confidence comes first the feeling comes
after people often wait that they feel
confident in terms to jump into the game
but it is actually through jumping in
the game that you gain the confidence to
play in the game so it's you can wait
all you want but in order to to kind of
acquire this level of confidence you
have to take that leap of faith and what
takes and what keeps players from taking
that leap of faith is then indeed fear
which you clearly overrided by uh the
two believes that I think I pointed out
the thing is okay let's say you're
giving away a little portion of money
you don't need to give away 400k you
know you can give away okay so
proportionally that we still have to
talk about what is Justified wonders
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know it's
like this is the mistake I've I did many
times like I I was like but then I
started learning okay maybe I take
smaller pieces in myself now like this
is something I've worked a lot on the
last year because in the beginning of
this year I made like um
super sick amount of money
I made like two I like crushed some
tournaments at the Bahamas and some cash
games in LA and then I was winning so
much and then when the High Roller
scenes start okay I asked I talked with
I remember talking with Adrian Mateos in
Vegas and I was like okay because I used
to play some terms I don't play much but
I played some you know and then I talked
to him like because we were playing cash
games every day like uh one two four
game okay at uh Vegas and then I asked
him like
what do you think I'm considering trying
to start like playing these like 25k
plus you know and he was like yeah you
should try they're not
they're very tough obviously but
at some point you're going to be able to
handle your own and yeah and that's what
I did I tried and in the beginning it
was very well but then Triton came you
know these and I started taking very big
pieces of myself like I had big exposure
and I went on like a huge downswing
let's say like now in the in the fall
now and then I just like okay what did I
learn okay you need to study this more
you need to learn 20 big blinds you need
to learn 15 big blinds you need to learn
25 big blinds you know you need to learn
some ICM you know all these things
because this is where the most of the EV
comes from you know learning these
things and so then I took this
three-month break after EBT Monaco more
or less two two and a half months and I
started learning like okay
very interesting I started playing some
tournaments on a Tuesday random Tuesday
just to like Implement what I've learned
and I screenshot some hands you know I
was always working on becoming better so
people have different sway different
ways of studying but I was always like I
want to learn how this works how this
works how this works you know and just
I'm always interested in learning I'm a
very curious man you know maybe not by
sitting in front of a computer watching
like how the same works every day but
like watching like YouTube reels like
YouTube highlights of how like good
players play like you know and you just
learn you learn a lot by like being
interested in like having this like
motivation you know so absolutely then
the way you look at the rails right you
don't look at that entertainment but you
look at it through a more Curious lens
that maybe yeah you can actually pick
something up that someone else just like
oh cool hand and that's it
because
any way you think about it like either
way
some players are gonna have like and I
mean everybody there are gonna have some
interesting things to say if you just
like strike them down like oh no this is
stupid this is stupid this is not how it
works you know they might have a good
point where you're just like too gonna
oh no I learned this so this must be
wrong you know you got to see it from
both sides you know because there might
be some truth in this and that so I've
always been like okay
even though I don't think this has got
it is a great player even I just still
listen I'm just trying to let him speak
and then make like uh okay and think
about a little bit okay maybe this isn't
that bad you know maybe this is actually
good you know because most of the time
player all players have some good things
to come with like they have like some
information you don't know anything
about
yeah to have a different perspective
that you can actually learn from exactly
you know and this is like being like
being like humble enough to like
understand like okay maybe I am better
than him or maybe he's better than me
that if you just listen and try to see
what they do because they must be doing
something right they're winning money at
poker you know I mean yeah so the
question is not instead of just being oh
he's so bad the question that more
becomes okay he approaches the poker he
approaches poker and awaited from my
perspective is not optimal however he is
winning a lot so probably he has a
certain perspective that I can learn
from that's kind of that Curiosity that
you pointed out that's that's the thing
and even when I talk to my friends I can
say oh this guy just made a huge bad
play you know I just tried to like I can
almost I'm always trolling them because
I'm trying to like see how they react to
when I tell this hand you know and then
I'm just like because I've obviously
been thinking about it for the last half
an hour and then this is like
then I'll start thinking on it when if
he says oh maybe it's not that bad maybe
I need to reevaluate you know yeah or
you can ask you can ask yourself like
when on the which circumstances is
displayed on the yeah on the which
assumptions is displayed good because
apparently at certain assumptions that
he made this play so then maybe in a
vacuum right now how the situation was
that play was not optimal but maybe on
the certain circumstances are the
assumptions display is actually very
good so instead of just butchering the
play you can say under which kind of
circumstance is this play actually very
good and can I actually use this
exactly you know and this is like a lot
of poker players have big egos myself
included like I would say like I would
say most of poker players like
especially like accomplished ones have
big egos this is how it wins because
they feel it they're getting attention
they're like oh you're so good blah blah
blah you understand like and it's gonna
feed your ego and this is just how it is
but if you just like sometimes take a
second and just think okay what because
you're not doing everything right if
you're doing everything right you would
win all the money like every time not
every time but you know what what I mean
you just feel like yeah of course your
mistakes are part of your win rate
basically exactly and then just like
we're all humans we're not robots and
you can study that solvers as much as
you want and it's a great great tool and
I use it myself for sure especially for
this ICM and this short stack game I've
been using it uh quite frequently in the
last two months
and you know you learn a lot of new
interesting things about how like how it
works you know if you just see a pattern
you see okay this hand does this maybe
then in certain different situation this
does this and you know it's like if you
just look at something and try to learn
what it means it's just yeah you you
understand you just it's hard to explain
no I've been playing poker for a long
time and you know what I mean probably
yeah yeah like you I think you have an
ability to to grasp on Concepts really
well and again to make it a bit more
holistic and look at it from the bigger
picture like you're not trying to study
how 953 small blind big man that 20 BB
Works no you're trying to understand how
does 20bb play different from 10 bb or
40 BB and what are like the main
Concepts like the main the main things
that change in my strategy and then
there are certain moments like oh 20 BB
plays different from 40 BB because of
these factors and then you apply these
factors in under the gun versus big
plant on Ace Jack 10 but also small band
versus big land then Olympus Four right
it does exactly it doesn't matter
no it's like you know how it is we've
been playing hundred big blinds plus
since yeah whatever you know and then
it's like 100 big blind poker is very
aggressive and you called Bluffs and
it's a cash game the more tournaments is
more about stack preservation and try to
make like good adjustments because
playing like the game three three like
when you have 10 big lines 20 because 30
big ones but it's very difficult and
with ICM you know it's like it's very
different you know so you try to make
more adjustments and simplify way more
because it's
yeah it's too big and it's too
complicated and it it changes too much
you know it changes a lot with ICM
without ICM close to the money you know
it's like it changes all the time so the
only the only thing you can do is like
like make it as easy as possible for
your brain because it's impossible to
consume all this information it is
impossible
you can say whatever you want but it's
impossible there's no man alive who will
ever be able to do this
and if there is someone doing this
they're most likely cheating
I would say so it's like you got to make
it as easy as your for yourself as
possible and try to understand the
concept instead of like trying to do
whatever the solver does every time you
know because in that case you might
blunder more than you do right and there
was a point where I was just trying to
like I was studying a lot and I was
trying to do what solver did every time
and I was just looking and I was like
man I [ __ ] this up I [ __ ] this up I
[ __ ] this up you know because I was
trying things I didn't understand the
concept I didn't understand anything
you know I was just looking at it I was
like oh yeah this is what it does I'm
gonna do this yeah so so so not study it
the the also it's very important when
you go into a study session to think
about okay what's my desired outcome
desired outcome is not to learn what to
do on this specific board the desired
outcome is to look for patterns and look
for Concepts that I can apply at 20 BB
yeah and just not 20 maybe 30 will be
fully exactly and then you might compare
like this for example instead of
studying a couple boards we might take
the same situation at 10 bb20 bb30b4
wvnc okay what are common trends that
change and what is the concept that I
can crash on that that I can just take
in consideration like normally I do this
but the 20 BB this concept for me is
more important so I'll do apps and it's
not going to be right all the time but
generally speaking you're going to be
yeah you're going to be better of doing
that than not
exactly and then you have the jump from
100 BB to 200 BB you know and you see if
we played a lot of live games you're
very used to playing like 200 VV 300 VV
you know you're very used to this and
then you have all of these guys who are
not used to this you know they don't
understand the concepts like
and understanding ranges and understand
how things work is way better for you
for your learning path I would say than
to actually just like be focused on what
it does all the time because people have
this like great tool but they use it in
like
in a very wrong manner I would say
they're trying to copy it instead of
understanding like the concept
because
some of like I've talked to some of like
the best players in both HUD sub and six
Max and they're saying like yeah we do
this but if you understand like the
concept of everything and where people
[ __ ] it up you do something completely
different yeah you just pound on it you
know and you find something like it
doesn't even need to be a big league
which is small leak in it might even be
a general leak like people have and they
just pound on it you know you just pound
pound Pound if people fall to see bets
too much it's not that bad to oversee it
you know it's yeah it's that easy
so that's again coming back like oh he
does this oh it is very bad under which
circumstance this is actually good well
if people are overfolding well and then
you can reflect is it actually the case
well maybe against me the central is not
played well because I don't overfold but
versus a general population I can see
why he makes this play again yeah like
an example how you can learn
and you can see some of the like the
absolute top top players in the world
like Adamo and lioness they're like two
of the most aggressive guys if you think
I'm aggressive they're just like all
over the place you know they're
aggressive in a different way they're
aggressive like it may be a a very
intelligent way where they know like oh
he's gonna overfold he's gonna do this
he's gonna react this he's gonna act
this way you know poker is very
aggressive
people have a hard time understanding
this poker is extremely aggressive and
that's how it's supposed to be at the
toughest like lineups on these things
people are going to be very aggressive
you're gonna have to fight for parts
they're never going to give you a
in most of the time not going to give
you a free chip for no reason at all
it's just you're gonna have to fight and
this is how it's supposed to be
you mentioned uh like in terms of the
the solvers that they then look at it
but they actually will do so the other
way around I know you're you're friendly
with uh with Magnus as well do you see
the same in chess for example how he
approaches chess they also consult the
machine is it kind of the same in chess
just out of curiosity I know there's a
little bit of a sideway but it was like
the thing I said like the thing is he's
like I would say
smartest guy I've ever met you know he's
just like all over the place very
intelligent you notice like when he sees
something and he does it like and he
just understands things very easily and
you know and the thing he I I've never
asked him about this because we don't
talk much about Chess we talk more about
other normal boy things to be honest not
about poker that much either but he's
like
the way I've understood it like he puts
people out of their comfort zone so it's
all about skill you know he reduces
variance this way this is a way for him
to reduce variance because he knows he's
the better player and there is some sort
of like variance in chess too like if
the clock is lower or whatever like
classic chess is like
you know what I mean like yeah so he
just tries to confuse people and take
him out of their comfort zone
because when they're both out of their
comfort zone he will be the better
player because you have to use your
thoughts and imaginations and Theory all
in a mix because if you have against
because some of these young guys are
being like they're studying Theory very
hard in chess too I would imagine you
know and if you put them in their Lane
they're probably going to be like equal
or maybe a little bit better a little
bit worse so this is variance you know
what I mean yeah I was having the big
day but if you put them out of their
comfort zone where they actually have to
like
they this is something they've not
studied
you know then you have to start to think
just yeah so you can have let's say for
example you have a default game tree and
then you can try to beat the other
person by out studying them in the
default game tree or you can just say
[ __ ] it I changed the game tree yes
from what I've from what I've understood
this is what he does
he does that's like he just yeah and
it's super smart it's very intelligent I
would say this is like
yeah it's like and it's this is like a
private game thing too in poker like if
you make the game like with a big ante
or like seven deuce or something you
have to start thinking stand-up game you
have to start thinking you put people
out of their comfort zone so like even
the biggest robots you're gonna have
shovels adapting because they're not
used to it you know they get an error
like error error what the [ __ ] is going
on why are people standing up and
sitting down exactly you know it's like
and this is like I don't really like
that in a live game you see some online
kids you're like okay let's see what
happens if I introduce this game this
game this game now see nothing yeah
exactly for me it's never been a problem
because I've always been like the guy
who adapts I adapt to things I see
things and I say okay this is how it is
now you either learn it or yeah it's
like
yeah it's like yeah survival of the
fitness thing you know it's like okay if
you can't adapt you're okay you're
[ __ ]
there has been times in my career where
I've played big big live games where
like
let's say it's not been very responsible
background management and it's like but
I never show them that you know I never
tell them okay this I've always been
there to fight and if I lose or win or
something at least always I learn
something you know
I always learned something and I know
it's a good spot for me to take even
though it didn't pan out this time
yeah and if you lose the money you can
always make it back exactly you know
it's like you don't have to lose all the
money but if you're just like are you
you need you need a little bit of money
left to make the money back exactly so
the best way to earn money is to have
money you know this is just always
where's them and
yeah I just think like taking some risks
when you're younger is like a very smart
thing to do and it's easy for me to say
man I live in Norway you know it's like
life is very comfortable here you know
it's like this is a big difference but
like I I'm not expecting a random guy
from Colombia to do the same and because
the money he has is like quite important
because yeah
I would say Rock Bottom looks different
than Norway than Rock Bottom in Colombia
exactly you know and
and I've always had good friends who've
always been like buying my action or
helping me when I've needed it you know
it's like this has always been a good
thing I've always been surrounded by
good people you know so I've never been
I've been at Rock Bottom myself too man
and even in Norway that sucks but you
know what every time it happened I
learned something and it was at younger
age mostly so it's like
it doesn't
it's not the end of the world
to go Buster when you're 22 23 you know
it's not it's not the end of the world
me this is not the way for everybody
some people are more disciplined and
more like but it also takes longer when
you do it this way you know most of the
time it takes longer if you don't get a
good thing if you're returning player if
you don't get a good thing you're just
gonna be struggling for a long time you
know
but it's also important to have a risk
reward premium you know it's like okay
how much am I gonna gain if I take this
risk how much am I going to lose you
know these things there are a lot of
variables and people have different
approaches but yes I took some more
risks when I was younger because I knew
like okay
if I didn't make it
at the beginning nobody everybody was
shattering this poker thing by Family by
friends you know everybody was like why
are you doing this Pokemon blah blah
blah why did you quit University blah
blah blah you know
but at the end like okay
if it if it doesn't pan out
I'm just like okay they were right and
I'm doing something else but if it does
work out that's a big [ __ ] you to
everybody you know
so it's like yeah okay so I made it what
are you gonna say now yeah risk reward
that was definitely uh was definitely
worth worth giving it a shot
yeah and then I looked at it like from a
very like okay I [ __ ] up this time we
go again
I [ __ ] up this time we go again you
know I'm not gonna let these people be
right
because this was like the biggest
motivation for me is like people were
like ah this poke blah blah blah but now
you see how people
look at me differently now because like
oh [ __ ] he actually made it it's
actually quite cool you know so the
whole motivation for me in the beginning
was this like I'm not gonna let these
people be right

further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode
Adam
leading up to the spot you know we
always go through like a little bit of
planning I said okay I'll I'll chat a
little bit in the beginning I'll give it
over to you quite quickly we're more
than an hour in because uh obviously the
conversation has been amazing so my
apologies for leaving you on the
sideline I will I will end up to you
with a little question that we're
talking about [ __ ] ups uh when in your
career do you remember one of your
career where you uh [ __ ] up and what
did you learn from it yeah so Rock
Bottom moment for me was probably what I
was shot taking 1K as upsetting goes and
I basically uh thought I'd break into
those levels quite quickly and the way
that format works is you have the best
players kind of guard the lobby you play
against them right battling and you try
to end their respect and if you in the
respect they will generally share their
lobbies with you so I was thinking all
right a few weeks maybe a few months
I'll earn my win and things got a bit
heated egos involved and months and
months and months went by with less and
less communication with these guys so
first it's like Skype calls like hey got
you guys like my game can I get in so to
speak and then months we're going by
where we're basically just having an
eagle battle and neither players wanted
to back down sideburned through most of
my role about 75 my bank robes just
burning through it like day after day
playing High rake I had seven over eight
right back at the time so I was getting
a good rate back deal I remember
thinking there is no light then the
tunnel it was like six months into
playing Rags every day and I was like I
need some light I need some hope that
maybe I can get in so I remember having
a few months from it was June till
August 2015 where I was like maybe I've
bitten off more than I can shoot maybe
I've went too far here and I need to
recalibrate so that time I had to really
do some analysis of my game and I kind
of take my Igor side stop the battling
for a few days and go right am I being
delusional here is this going to be end
well for me and then yeah during that
kind of analysis I realized I felt like
my game was strong enough I felt like I
was close to getting through there was
just like another leveling to get my
game too so that the players would give
me uh I could almost put too much
pressure on them that they had to let me
in so yeah next three months were like
just knuckle down really work hard but I
was getting a more and more financial
pressure I remember during this time
this was the first the first time since
I grew my bankroll that I had to start
into my lifestyle and I still go right I
don't stop spending money stopping up
for dinner so much stop putting the
lifestyle low expenses and yeah
basically it was the eight months of
playing basically the best guys in my
format almost every day so finally I got
into that that's probably two months
were really scary what I thought I could
go Brooke are you okay with that if I do
go broke what do I do I take a staking
deal for some friends and play it lower
can I live with that reality yes I can
okay let's go and like then go on with
this and kind of similar mindset to what
Cayenne has said throughout this podcast
kind of just trust yourself and go in
for it and sometimes it's going right
get knocked down get back up again get
knocked down get back up again so the
lesson I learned through that was
basically being resilient backing
yourself and keep going even when it
gets tough keep going I'm putting the
work in and over time nothing can last
forever so if you bang against the door
long enough at some point someone's
gonna answer you're gonna get into that
door so yeah learning resilience of that
time was definitely definitely a big
lesson so I want to get back to your
story Cayenne I've been listening very
patiently from the sides together your
career journey and the lessons you've
learned along the way I can see your
Fearless character someone who likes to
take a lot of risks but I want to go
back to the start of your career I think
we'll jump in at a good point where you
went pro so you can take us back when
you decide to take poker professionally
I know you're studying and playing a
little bit live around 2015 you
mentioned can you take us back to uh the
moment you decided to go pro and what
were your expectations going into pocket
okay so the thing is I was studying
economics and then that's what I was
talking about 2015 and then after a
while in this period I started like
winning a little bit I started like okay
maybe I can do this maybe I can't blah
blah blah and then I went back and forth
back and forth many times how are my
parents gonna react part of my friends
gonna react and all this and then it
came to I just got like almost like a
revelation I would say at the end of
maybe like mid end of 2016 like okay
uh summer is over everybody's going back
to school am I
you know
and then instead of going back to school
which I was supposed to because I
already signed up
I started playing live poker at these
games 16 hours a day
and I mean 16 17 hours a day every day
just playing playing playing playing
playing
and I went busto Maybe
I would say like three times during
those five months but I have I had some
very good friends there would always
like give me like a very small not like
a huge huge loan but like a loan again
so I could get back up because every
time this happened I would be very
motivated to get it back you know and
then I started working I got a job on
the side
it's like okay
so I got more stability not much but a
little bit but then I started like
taking very high variance routes like in
the beginning I was just going past the
back to like let's say a thousand us
because I was playing a one-two game
so I I did this a lot of time and this
when I after I would say my breakthrough
like kind of breakthrough was like maybe
2017 like mid 2017 when I started okay
now I have like 50k us
but then the partying came and then you
know the Degen lifestyle I was
surrounded by like very bad environment
I would say I was gaining a lot of
weight I was yeah I was not feeling very
well you go to like a zombie mode kind
of when you're playing this much because
I was playing
Non-Stop
16 hours a day if I wasn't working I was
doing playing this is the exactly what I
did I woke up at 6 P.M every day
between four and seven PM every day this
is just like and I was living with my
friend from Norway his name is
Christopher and like he was living with
me for five years and he would just say
he never saw me I didn't see my friends
for
I would say between 2016 until
beginning of 2018 I almost didn't see my
friends for like almost two years
birthday parties wouldn't show up
nothing which I wouldn't show up to
anything only thing I want to show up
for was Christmas
and I went back home to my family for
Christmas
and I
after Christmas Eve like the same day I
would go play
like I was like super hungry I wanted to
learn I just like every day I was just
learning something new I couldn't sleep
well I was thinking about program how
can I do this better like I was getting
obsessed
why some people like develop like
like degeneracy for money I was just
like developing like okay how can I get
better how can I do this yes I was
pounding hard with the bankroll and
everything but I was just like learning
in the process I like every Beatdown I
took was a great learning experience you
know and this is maybe what's different
from me to others like people might get
there were certain points in my career
like I was impressed but still I managed
to get something out of it you know I
wasn't living a good life I was
like playing every day so I think my
real breakthrough was like when I moved
to Oslo in 2018 I started playing this
five card PLO apps on the computer and
in the beginning it was like going very
bad like I was losing all of my net
worth again and uh I was a lot in London
learned living with there were some
Norwegians living there and I learned
poker with them and I started playing
amputees No Limit cash and five card
below so I had a big Spectrum you know
and I was winning in all formats so
after a while I started learning okay
maybe if I play a little bit of
everything and try to learn everything
and in software games I can build up my
net worth because I understood at some
point I need to have some money and
stability because in 2018 I was 24 you
know
so I was
yeah
uh and then I started playing I started
going to La at the Commerce I don't know
if you guys heard about the LA
conference it's like a huge No Limit
team they have six seven five ten games
running every day and 10 20. I went to
Commerce with 30k I remember this was
either late 2017 or late 2018 I'm not
sure or early 2018 I'm not sure but it
was in that time frame I went there with
30k
and I came back home three months later
with 130k so I made like 100k on 510 in
like two three months
so I finally had some money and then
after that I maybe went buster one or
two times more
until the end like
I would say right before covid started
like 2020 so I was just going back and
forth playing PLO apps playing online
cash I was losing on 500 Zoom like from
2018 until 2019 by learning just like by
playing I was losing a lot but I was
losing
and then I started learning okay why am
I losing what am I doing wrong
I need to go learn something and I've
always been alone wolf I've not been
like
I had study partners nothing like this
I've always been like learned by my own
I had some friends I was talking poker
with obviously but yeah
so I remember this is like when the
Breakthrough started for me I was
I went to
La in the beginning of 2020 for
so I was playing 500 Zoom there right
before then and I was becoming a winner
in the game like one BB Maybe 100.
so again I had like 50K
I went down there to play 5 10 and 10 20
when it was running but the problem with
that game was 10 20 40. so you had to
buy in like 5K
so at that point I was like okay I won
20K on 510 I'm gonna take a shot now I'm
just gonna go for it I ended up winning
like almost 200k on 10 24K and like in
the span of one month
because the game's just got super juicy
and then I had three almost 300K to my
name I would say
then I got invited to uh 100 200 game at
the Hawaiian Gardens which was a private
game
and I was pretty I was better than the
lineup for sure there was nothing but I
had a big ego thing here I I was like
I'm the best player uh I'm gonna win
against him blah blah blah and I sold I
remember selling 50 to uh three guys
I've met from the UK at that time in LA
because they came from Macau and they
were
uh they were like very financially
stable they had a lot of money and uh
Macau shut down because of kovid and
then they came to LA to play and then I
told them about this opportunity and
they bought 50 and I just got
immediately dusted like
I lost almost
75 of what I won from my own share back
to them like immediately after and then
kovit came
I came back to Norway with 60k I had to
go back and then I rented my basement at
my sister's place
and I decided okay it's now or never now
I just have to start because now like I
started a company I'm gonna pay my taxes
I'm gonna do everything by the law if I
buy the book because I'm officially a
professional with disabled
and then I started playing 500 Zoom
which the wacko knows a lot about
because we were playing infinite hands
against each other
I was playing
14 hours a day
every day I was paying four tables of
zoom and I would even mix in some two
five round tables and five ten
roundtables and I was just playing
playing
and I would say those six months I was
playing between 400 and 600 000 pants I
was
thanks so much and I began to win a lot
and I was steadily like staying at 5 10
now and grinding 500 in one side and
and yeah and just doing this and then
early 2021 I was making my jump to 10 20
and then I got knocked back down to 510.
then I decided to play some tournaments
because my good friend Espin and those
guys were playing
it was scoop 2021 I think it was at the
end I was decided okay I'll play a few
tournaments then I ended up dinking a 1K
for like second place for 70k
and then I was like okay [ __ ] it I'm
gonna sell 50 of my 10K scoop
and play the 1K Main and the whatever
and then I ended up chopping the 10K
scoop made for 800k
which was like huge Bank robust I just
got like 5x66 no maybe four of X is what
I had
and then after that I just like okay
now I have enough money because I have
to give it 50 away but I had enough
money and then I started playing 10 20
and some 25.50 I was getting slaughtered
at 25.50 again because every time I used
to jump up I always got slaughtered back
down to the steak I was at it was just
like it was getting very frustrating
and then I got into Bobby's room game at
Vegas because I'd say okay I'm going to
go to the WSOP I have 500k but first i'm
gonna take a Chick-fil-A again with this
insane win rate I just win 130k at La in
two weeks
so we had to go to Mexico first for
because we had to stay out of the Europe
for two weeks to get into the US for
some reason so he went to Mexico with
two friends
and then
I got to Bobby's room and I just got I
didn't sell one percent of my action and
I played 151 too or one two or whatever
it was and I just lost like immediately
like 400k
and just this is the closest yeah so I
haven't been busted in a long time like
I've had low liquid but uh
fortunately enough I've been smart
enough to have assets since that time
um yeah so this was like I would say
that was a very low point for me when I
finally like oh this is me now I'm gonna
make it and then you just and this is
like two years ago it was like I didn't
lose close to all my money I still had a
good portion but it was like I finally
had a big chunk of money and I just
ended up losing a lot of it right after
and then I started playing yeah sorry
sorry I'm I'm curious to dive into uh
how you perceive risk as I've been
listening along there's so many
opportunities where you've taken on like
a high risk option uh you've almost like
put your role on the line in high
various scenario and almost got like
slapped in the face or a bad result as a
result of that but it didn't detail you
if anything he was came back and took
another risk in another shot another
shot so I'm really curious to know how
you perceive risk and how you go about
taking risks you mentioned earlier you
need to have a risk to reward premium so
tell me through like how you're making
these decisions in your career as you're
going for these kind of big shots and
put another your role on the line you
know a lot of players would be like wow
I could never put myself in that
situation how are you able to take on
that risk and what was your kind of
framing of how you could deal with risk
so the thing is uh when I was playing
this game for the Bobby's room game
while I had a ton of money now I was
like okay I can go away from here with
like 2 million will go away from here
with 200k okay if I have 200k or I have
500 600k
what's really the difference but if I
have 2 million
you know it's like if you have 2 million
you have a lot of money you can start
taking that big of a risks anymore you
can just like stabilize your life buy an
apartment or two and just take it easy
and play 10 20 and have fun which is
like if you do this
this is way better for your life in
general
but the thing is would I really stop at
2 million this this is the thing though
you know I've always been not always but
in like the later years I've always been
like okay now I have this what do I do
with this
what do I do now I put this away I buy
something nice I buy an apartment I I
try to stabilize my life in case things
go to [ __ ] which which isn't like very
very low chance of now which it could
have been like like yeah I've been lucky
in my life I've been when I needed it
it's always like Came to Me Maybe it's
not like luck maybe it's just like the
termination of like I want to do it
maybe I don't know it's hard to say
really but yeah it's uh it's been a
journey like
it needs to be some risk I need to have
some like uh yeah I need to have some
skin in the game like I've always been
like that because I don't feel it's like
smart to like
try to be like the cautious guy because
you'll never yeah you might get
somewhere but it's you need to have like
feel like it's something it's burned
it's burning under your feet or you're
just like doing something to make your
life as good as possible yes sometimes
you'll get slapped in the face that's
just a part of life you know you can
either let them break you or just
continue
yeah it sounds like you have a very
investors mindset and although it can
seem Reckless at times when you take big
shots you're actually very calculated
and you're taking time to go I got this
money available if I get this outcome
from winning this will set my life up
this way and if it goes this way and
goes badly I can handle it so I'm
curious to know how you balance when
your risks don't pay off we could use
the Bobby's room example that'd be a
good one to dive into you or what do you
do the next day or during that time when
you take a risk you take a big shot you
spend years building your room to a
certain level you take a big shot with
it and you go back down to where you
were a few years previously how do you
deal with that what are some of the
things you've learned from that
experience that set you up to have
success going forward
first of all I take a break I don't play
because
my biggest issue has been mindset issues
like when I'm like losing a lot of money
in a short period of time I don't have
my head won't always stabilize it's
gotten way way better but before I
remember oh it was so bad I could
because if I was losing a lot in a
period I would just lose even more on
like
tilt like just losing my mind basically
just yeah I still have some
sometimes it happens but not in the same
way no but yeah I take a big break
I re-evaluate I regroup
I tried to study I tried to play lower
Stakes for like a small period of time
when I'm after the break
like because I'm Rusty and everything
even even Renee I was playing two five
with him like three weeks ago because
I've been like in uh two months break
I do the same every time when I'm taking
a long break I try to like
okay this is what I'm gonna do I gotta
reevaluate you know it's just like on
big downswings I've seen a lot of like
good people like just like lose all
their money because of one big downswing
because they just never group you know
and they go back on stake and then yeah
and the same Cycles happen over many
many times you know so I might I think
my trick is just to take a long break
focus on what what's good in my life and
just see like this is all because of
Poker like look I have a flashy new
apartment in Oslo I'm gonna buy my
second one in the six months I'm 29
years old and I'm like I have two
apartments in like one of the
most expensive cities in the world you
know it's like I just look at these
things I have I have a healthy family I
have a good family I have good friends
you know I try to like look at what's
good in my life just to recoup you know
just to spend some time with them and
just just be grateful you know just to
be grateful sometimes you gotta be
grateful and just like okay I had a
rocket period and then we fight again we
go again you know this is what we do you
mentioned that your mental game was one
of your biggest opponents what did you
have to do to work on your mental game
what are some of the specific things you
like to do to improve that
actually I must say
my ego was my biggest problem I had to
like I still have an ego for sure I
still have an ego but the the hardest
part for me was like losing when I felt
like I didn't deserve to lose you know
it's like I I would win in like toughest
games
like tough tough games I would win but
when I got to like very good and fun
games where I should be like I thought I
was like I'm gonna be a big winner in
this game I always got demolished you
know it's just like and I think that was
a way of mindset I was like going there
expecting to win you know and as a poker
player this is like the biggest trap
like going there expecting to win is
like a very big trap yes you can expect
against me we go in there to expect to
win is like a very cocky big ego thing
to do and this was this thing I used to
do now in my I would say like these last
two years I've been like a big lesson
for me many ways like I've been low on
liquid and been discs and this but I've
never been even close to bus though you
know and this is like and I can always
like look around look this is mine this
is me you know I have so much of this
because of Poker instead of being
ungrateful and expecting and like
demanding to win
you just like okay I didn't win today
maybe I'll win tomorrow maybe I'll win
next week who knows but you know what I
wouldn't have any anything of this if it
wasn't the problem you know you just got
to buy like sit down sometimes be
grateful and how many cool people I've
met you know it's just like a lot of
good things have came to my life since
it's like it's very hard to do when
you're like losing a lot and just like I
think this has been my biggest week it's
my ego maybe and it it like it
correlates with like the expectations of
winning and this but yeah and the mental
game yeah yeah so I'm curious to know
how you were able to address that let's
say you notice this kind of entitlements
when you're playing the softer games and
expecting to win now feels like that's
no longer an issue what do you have to
do to address that I'm guessing this was
a bit of a recurring problem for a while
what are some of the things that were
helpful for you in overcoming that part
of your ego
you know the the funny part is I I Gotta
Give a lot of honor to my sister my big
sister she was like
because she's the one who made me aware
of all this you know it's just like look
at everything you have it's because of
Poker
he's like look like just look around
what why are you stressing someone
because I was like very stressed and I
was very annoyed and I was
yeah and uh you know uh the way I
addressed this it was like okay
some this is poker it's variance It's
Gonna Hurt You It's Gonna slap you in
the face sometimes you can play your
best game you can make the best
decisions and you still won't win
but this is what I learned like
it's easy to say but it's actually
harder to comprehend than people would
imagine you know it's like
because it in other sports or like other
Games and Things variance is not a big
deal it's not a huge issue but in poker
like it is a big issue sometimes you're
just gonna you gotta lose lose and then
win is like
it's very hard to understand even though
I've been playing poker for such a long
period of time it's it's still hard for
the mind to like comprehend because
money is stability and stability is
comfortability and then and this is what
most people want you know and when this
gets shaky it does something with you it
it's hard to explain you got to be in
the situation but I'm assuming you you
had the same experience when you were
playing the stickman girls when you lost
75 you know it's just it does something
with you and you get knocked down at
either you can just like lay down or you
just gotta get back up and try again you
know this is all we can do
yeah I think it's something very Primal
how we link our resources money in
particular to survival needs so when
resources are threatened at any time it
almost takes on a primal nature we get
really activated in our physiology we
want to fight back we want to do
something to protect ourselves because
we don't want to go broke and lose this
valuable resource so to speak so uh yeah
I think with that when you throw a
variance into the equation there and it
almost excuse everything that's going on
so your results coming back aren't
accurate in the short term but you're
trying to make sense of it and then
something that's really valuable to use
going down and down and down and all of
a sudden the mind starts freaking out so
yeah I think there's so much to work on
in terms of your relationship with money
your relationship with winning your
relationship with losing and almost
everyone who gets into poker has these
issues at some points they have to come
to terms of the ego come to terms of
emotions so it's something for you this
talk with your sister and get more
gratitude into your life being
appreciative of what you're going
through I'm curious to know when you had
less in your life like let's say when
you hadn't achieved the success that you
currently have how did you maintain
confidence during these kind of failed
attempts that's colder when things were
going badly we were taking risks because
I don't know for you you're you're kind
of picking yourself up and going again
but I'm wondering like what are you
saying to yourself during these periods
to remain confident that you're able to
turn this around like now you've got a
track record you've got a lot of success
around you but in the early days how do
you keep your confidence to keep taking
risk again again and brush yourself off
so so this is the thing about me since
since I was a kid like I mean a young
kid I've I've always learned things like
very past you know I've never been like
a big homework guy but I just understand
things in like very quicker ways I find
shortcuts and this has always been like
my Mo since I was a little kid I was
Finding shortcuts and I've always gotten
better at games than most people or if
it was put like I just learned things
faster but this also makes me like very
entitled to things you know like I don't
work as much as on things you know it's
just it's like a gift and a curse thing
you know and this is the thing like
it's good in some ways and it's very bad
in some ways you know because you get
entitled to not do as much and then did
that am I answering your question now I
feel like I'm railroading it okay yeah
no so this level of entitlement has been
like my biggest biggest opponent because
I feel like okay I'm better than him I
can do this I don't need to do anything
you know
but I'm learning faster than him I don't
need to do anything but this is not true
you know because there are probably way
many more smarter people out there than
me many and people are learning way
faster than me and then and they're
working twice as hard so how am I gonna
stay
level in the competition
obviously I'm going to fall low down
like on the bar like because I'm not
doing anything and this is just I just
understood at some point like the last
like I said the last year year and a
half has been like a big
thing for me like this level of
entitlement has been going down yes I
was still I'm still struggling with it
sometimes but like
I've also understood like
you're not better than anyone you are
you are a person as well and if you're
gonna go around underestimating all of
your opponents and all the people around
you at some point you're gonna fall
you're just gonna and I think this was
the problem I had like mid 2019 until
end of 2020 like the level of
entitlement you know like I deserve this
I deserve I don't need to work for it I
deserve it I've had it way worse than
him when I was growing up I hadn't you
know it's just
you feel like you deserve something but
you actually don't you don't deserve
anything you know everybody life
everybody has had a bad time every life
sucked for many people you know it's I
don't deserve more than him him or him I
deserve what I work for and that you
know finally it took me a long time but
maybe it comes with the age I just
learned okay
this is your life you can choose to like
feel bad for yourself or you can
actually do something about it you know
I think it highlights something very
important of it's good to have
confidence yourself it's almost good to
have a little bit of an ego at times to
back yourself but that can quickly go
into overconfidence entitlements and
feel like you deserve something so as he
was speaking there I was writing down
growth mindsets you've got a growth
mindset you could think and learn get
better and you also uh almost like
identified yourself as someone who's
smart learns quickly quite talented so
you've got like kind of two things going
on which kind of come from each other
but they can also create problems if you
think you're talented and you're good at
something all of a sudden you expect to
win and when you're not winning you're
like well why not I'm a toddler kid I do
things well but if you're pale like a
mindset which I've as I've been
listening to speak the whole
conversation a lot of things learn by
doing always how to play good opponent
so I can learn from them it's all this
like this growth mindset around I learn
by doing whatever my current skill set
is it doesn't really matter because I
can get better by the act of doing this
and I pick things up quickly so I can
get better so yeah I think for you uh
your kind of confidence is coming from
your ability to learn
um it's high rates but also in tough
lineups and tough competition I think
some people who are maybe struggling to
apply this kind of concept for
themselves might not have that
confidence that they can learn in the
same way you can it feels like for you
uh put you against anyone almost in the
world you're like I'll definitely get
better I may not beat this guy exactly
but I'm gonna get pretty good at this
game so you back yourself so in terms of
what you do to learn you want to go
super specific but I'm curious to know
what helps you in learning because you
mentioned you you do learn by doing
you're not the guys into the solver
you're the guy who plays tough opponents
and you learn from them what do you
think allows you to uh extrapolate
Knowledge from good players where other
players may play the same games as you
uh but not learn at the same rate
so the thing is when people play better
players they're very focused on playing
their best you know I'm always focused
on playing my best as well that's not
what I'm saying I'm just saying I'm also
eager to find out what they're doing and
why they're doing it because in the
beginning when I was playing poker the
level of entitlement and everything oh
everybody was bad and this and that then
you know you just you're just hammering
on everybody but instead of doing that
now the later years I've been like okay
this guy is better than me so he's doing
something right you know it's just
I let go some of the entitlements and
some of like the ego issues I still have
it 100 I still do have it for sure but
instead of doing all these things I just
like okay
if some player thinks I'm bad like
whatever let them think it you know I'm
just trying to be the best as I can be
and like the best way I find it correct
look I'm using the solvers for my own as
well but in the spare time I'm also like
trying to see what people do I rail
games where you're playing super high
stakes and try to see okay why did you
do this and then I go check it through
oh it was actually pretty good you know
and this was not something I expected
and there boom I learned something you
know and this is I think my biggest
quality now is like trying to
like understand what other people do
maybe they're better or worse than me
you know it doesn't even it doesn't
matter that much but like if they're
doing something right I want to have it
in my strategy too I want to have it in
my Arsenal you know because the only
thing I can do is grow as much as
possible it's not like yeah and my fan
financial situation is like
very stable like I'm
right now I don't need to stress that
much about money I don't need to play
every day I I can choose when I play and
this this gives me like I'm feeling very
calm now which I wasn't like maybe
before you know yes I'm getting a lot of
curiosity when you're playing in tough
lineups in particular and the opposite
of what you were saying before in these
lineups you put your ego to one side and
you're like all right what can I learn
what are these guys doing what can I
Implement into our into my game it
reminds me of sports and how some people
are players in particular are very good
against the best competition the play
the a game and then they play like a
weak competition who they expected to
beat and they'll lose because they
almost like get complacent they drop
their standards and I must say nothing's
up to you but it sounds like you you
rise to the occasion against tough
players because you you don't care that
you're not necessarily winning in the
short term so I think this is quite a
hard thing for players to realize I'm
sure some people listening maybe a lot
of people listening will not be able to
put themselves in tough lineups when
they know they're the worst player but
for you it seems like you don't really
worry about that because you're like
right well I'll just learn Lords if
these guys are amazing let's get my pen
out get my notepad out time to learn so
for you do you feel fear in these
moments like let's say if you sit down
to play whether it's David Jones or
lioness do you feel fear when you sit
down the player are you just excited and
curious when you step into challenges
like this this this this must I say this
is one thing I must say this has been
one of my strengths I never give respect
to anybody like I don't I don't care who
you are like I've been playing with like
Philip Patrick Antonio's all of these
like top dog like big I never give them
respect I treat them as who they are and
I treat them as an opponent and if
they're a good person I'm willing to
talk to them and respect them in that
manner and then poker wise I I tend to
not have care and I just do what I think
is best look if I have to run a big
block I'm running it I don't care this
is I'm sure the whole Poke Community can
vouch on this like if I have to do
something I feel is right I will do it
no matter the money online what whatever
so now the the thing I do now is like I
don't put as much money in risk as
before which makes it I'm I'm either I'm
even more afraid of losing other
people's money than my own which is like
a weird mindset you know I've gotten
actually maybe not afraid but like oh
what is he gonna think is he gonna think
I [ __ ] up you know this is a bit like
yeah it's it's hard to say really
because it's hard to explain but uh yeah
I feel more worrisome about losing other
people's money than my own like this I
feel way worse about that you know if
you know I don't know if you can
correlate but or you understand but this
is this is the way I feel like I don't
have fear I would say I always do what I
think is right and for sure I'm probably
around 100 times a day who knows you
know but the best thing I can do is try
to give my best and be like as focused
as I can
and uh do well by people who either
invest or like have faith or whatever
you know and I try to do my best every
day and this is all I can do really you
know I we all have limitations
yeah I think a big thing for you as well
is you're kind of scorecard of winning
the losing isn't necessarily money
related it's not like did I win the
session it's am I learning am I getting
better so for you let's say you were
playing a tough lineup two really good
players and you were losing against
those I think your strategy was locking
behind but you felt like you were
learning even though you're kind of
costing yourself a video You're costing
yourself playing against these players
how would your mind friend that is a win
because I know a lot of players get
anchored to money they get anchored too
am I winning am I losing when they lose
they almost say can't see the lessons
they're learning they can't see because
they lost on the financial scorecards if
he isn't for you that wouldn't even be a
factor so uh how do you frame maybe
short-term bad results as a win long
term just by learning perform those
opponents so this is the thing I was
talking about earlier you remember I
told you I told you about like I was
losing on 500 zoom in the beginning but
then I started winning you know and
after I started winning I just said
before maybe I learned something by
playing all these hands okay I was
losing a little bit
but look at me now now I'm earning 10
times as much you know and at the end of
kovid I was winning six and a half maybe
100 on 500 Zoom which is like super sick
you know it's super good and then by
losing all that money in that learning
experience that made me like a big
winner
so I looked at like okay short term this
is what happens but long term okay so
short term I'm losing but if the future
Evie is going to get me like up there
isn't it really worth it to just like
give away something here and then after
like I said talk to Renee about like the
the big picture the big picture is like
very important for me it's like you know
I don't look at things in a vacuum like
it's like it's not like this it's like
this
um this has always been like my mindset
about everything like I always strive
for efficiency and like try to do as
like easy as possible for both me and
people around me you know I don't wanna
let's say
yeah I don't have a good example right
now but just like
like when I was doing my homework when I
was younger I would always like copy
like the things I found very boring
because I knew I wouldn't find the time
to do it myself so my
efficient way to do it I would just be
like copy or just ask a question and
then get the answer you know what I mean
it's like because if I knew some like I
knew my limitation was laziness
so I found a way to like
yeah compensate kind of you know it was
like a quid pro club they would do this
for me and I would do that for them you
know it's like I would almost change
like you know because I was always like
semi-good at some things and they were
like good at the boring things and it
would just change it was like in yeah it
was like a business approach you know
what I mean kind of leveraging your
skill sets and then finding yeah
shortcuts or efficiencies for maybe
things you're not good at not interested
in and you mentioned um the big picture
a few times I'm interested in how do you
keep a big picture or more importantly
what is the big picture for you and
where do you think other players maybe
get a bit short-sighted and don't see
the bigger picture this I've gotten
these questions from before like
actually my mother asked me this because
I always tell her about the big picture
as well and it's very hard to like
elaborate what I mean but like the big
picture is like
you started here your goal was here and
you tried to end up here you're like
this is like the picture you know and if
you have to go like through bumps on the
road this is just how it is you have you
start somewhere and the end line is here
you know you gotta find out where when
am I gonna be happy when is it over when
is it good for me when I'm a good when
am I in a good place and
the thing is for me if I look it back at
me for like five or six years ago you
know I just I would never imagine I
would be here right now you know it's
like it's very it's very hard to see
from down there
but when you're up there it's like
wow the thing is if I had to go through
that Journey again and I knew it was the
same I would do it for sure like it it
was just a part away becoming the person
I am today you know it was just a part
of my journey and I think what I mean
about the big picture is like
you just try to see the end like where
do I want to be how do I want to be as a
person
and did I reach my goal and no it wasn't
always the best it maybe it wasn't the
best way to do it but
would I be the same guy I am today if I
didn't
you know what I mean
yeah so it sounds like understand like
zooming out and looking at like the big
picture about what the ultimate end goal
is that I'm trying to achieve and then
as you're progressing towards that goal
checking in and realizing I'm making
progress towards that this is good even
the small progress is good checking in
to go right I've actually come a long
way over the last year two years remind
yourself of the journey that you've
already came on and then also uh give
yourself a little bit of credit for yes
I'm making progress I'm moving towards
this goal and almost like that's feed in
the system and remind yourself why
you're doing it as well things important
you're kind of your motives for going
down this path and then also on that
Journey realizing that you're growing as
a person you're becoming a better
version of yourself on this journey so I
think all these things kind of Encompass
the big picture which I think is a it's
such a good way to think because the big
picture should always override the short
term like if you've got your if the big
picture is on track and you can connect
with that short terms just like just
bumps in the road just ups and downs a
roller coaster goes into a dip before it
comes back up again you can override
that if the big picture is clear so has
there been any times in your career
where you were almost lost a bit of Hope
or you maybe got a little bit too uh
caught into the short terms and you had
to learn a lesson to get back in touch
with the the bigger picture
for sure like what I was talking about
like um so the thing I do now I'm
railroading a little bit just to get
back to the point after
um now I tend to like prioritize using
my time when I have time on social
things my friends family and everything
you know and before when I had the
short-sighted goal I want to have this
much money I want to do this and this
and this you know you just
you know you go into state of depression
almost you just like you focus on
nothing and like
yeah and the thing is you're not really
happy and if you if you reach your goal
and you're not even really happy was it
even worth it you know what I mean and
this is what I think I was doing like
when I didn't have so I was playing 16
hours a day and I I was putting in the
work man people think I was just laying
down on a beach somewhere I was putting
in real work like I I hear my friends
complaining about working uh seven and a
half hour job a day dude I was like I
didn't have a life nobody saw me and I
was just playing playing playing you
know and um
and I wasn't really happy you know I was
this is not why I started to play poker
I started to play poker because it was
interesting it was
complex it was like fun you know and the
thing is I think the last years I've
come like back the fun in it you know
and this is what keeps me motivated now
because if my motivation was all about
money like it was before
what would I do now I wouldn't I
wouldn't be happy because I have it now
you know it's like you're not happy
anymore and if you're not happy while
doing something you're supposed to like
how are you going to keep the motivation
up no then I'm gonna get back to
entitled I'm gonna give it back to this
and this and this you know it's like
and for me it was never it was never
about the money for me it was never
about the money the only reason I needed
the money was to take care of my future
family or my family and giving the
people I love the most everything they
needed you know because I'm not gonna
say I had a poor family but I never had
I couldn't just choose wherever I wanted
and get things I wanted like you
so I in this weird way I appreciate the
money but I don't appreciate the money
you know it's like for me it's like
always been better to give than to get
this has always been like my ammo just
see this one because for me I have
everything I need I don't I don't need
anything else but giving like
a gift to my mother or like doing
something good for a friend that might
not be in the situation he is or
something like this like it just makes
me very happy and overall and
and for me it's more important to be
happy
than to have a gazillion dollars this is
just
yeah I think it sounds like for you it
was really clear that you got the poker
for the fun and the enjoyments then a
certain parts of your career sometimes
you get too zoomed in on the success the
money attributes but that was never the
game that was never the goal that got
you into poker and the longer you focus
on that the more you get unhappy
miserable Your Life Starts sliding a bit
because you're too narrow with your
focus you've lost track of the big
picture of what you're doing so for you
it sounds like you've come full circle
up and down there's been a lot of
um turbulence in your journey let's call
it but you've come back to that where
you started that that's kind of fun the
enjoyment doing podcast because you
enjoy the game and you're curious and
it's a it's a fun thing to do so yeah I
think it's a real good story and a
really good life lessons for anyone
listening to uh remind themself of the
bigger picture for themselves we've all
got our own goals I'm guessing we all
want to be happy we all want to enjoy
our lives have fun as we're on the
journey but we all have achievements we
want to have as well so I remind
ourselves the bigger picture as we're
playing these small games of success of
money not getting too caught up in them
while still trying to optimize them for
a better life thing that's a great
lesson for the audience and you know
like just like a bonus thing like it's
way easier to do something well
and good and like earning more money if
you actually like and enjoy it you know
if you make it to something like you're
obligated to do I have to wake up every
day to do this this because in the
system we live in today you're very like
you have to do this this this this this
you know and for me I've always known
like
this is not for me I've always known
like I've forced myself into some things
like even to my like I didn't want to go
and started the economics degree I did
it because of like the peer pressure of
like the society you know it's just but
I knew something one day I don't need a
boss I Want To Be My Own Boss I want to
do this I want to have my freedom yes
people think I I'm lazy I don't do
enough but trust me in my periods of
time I work harder than I would say 99.9
of people you know but they just don't
see it with their own eyes they just but
that that's their belief and their I
don't really care what people think
about when it comes to this I just okay
but if you're working that hard why are
you not achieving the same level of
success you know what I mean it's just
like they're just trying to like feed
their own egos to life saying he's less
because he's doing that but but now this
is how it started but now everybody sees
like oh wow he's actually working hard
for this you know and this it's not
important for me what other people think
it's important for me with my family and
friends think because everybody's going
to have their own opinion everybody's
gonna say something and yeah this is
just how the world works man it's like a
lot of gossip and this and this and this
but what really really matters to me is
like the people around me yes I like all
people I'm not saying that but I'm just
like
yeah the level of like entitlement I
used to have maybe I I tend to see it
now in others too but it takes one to no
one you know what I mean it's like they
want to think they're better than you
because they have a normal job or based
on this and yeah you know what I mean
it's like you've probably been
encountered the same way before
um yeah I think for yourself as well
it's like other people put their own
kind of judgment onto you if you're
you've got this Freedom they're kind of
happy go lucky lifestyle people are like
well you can't have that like you're not
working hard enough you're not suffering
enough you're not grinding the same way
I am but behind the scenes you're you're
doing your own thing and you've like you
said you probably worked harder than a
lot of people in the past but also from
a place of enjoyment I think there's
like kind of sometimes we could give
timings for a barge of honor to kind of
working hard when in reality we
generally work our hardest when we want
to when we're curious when we love what
we're doing it's like is that really
work if you want to spend 10 hours a day
study important because you absolutely
love it is that really a work shift or
is it a player is it enjoyment so you
think yourself you give us nice
interplay between kind of work ethic but
also player and fun and enjoying it in
the kind of the merge the most merged to
the same thing now where you do because
you want to and fun and work as they
can't the same kind of same game
I wake up with a smile around
others okay I lost a [ __ ] ton of money
yesterday but I still wake up with a
smile and be like wait dude I just I
look around me and just I feel happy you
know I just I'm not
yeah before I wasn't but now I am like
because and it's not because of the
success or the money it's just because
I had a goal and I reached like I'm not
saying I reached my full goal but I
reached some parts of it and and I'm
still young you know I'm 29 you know
like many people use way longer time to
reach that level of success than like
people like us you know and then it's
fine I love to get some recognition for
it yes but what really matters for me
the most is like people around me like
oh wow
you're super sick at this congrats and
I'm super happy for you you know you're
just like genuinely happy because some
people might be jealous some people
might be this this the people who are
genuinely happy for you and have been
through all parts of the road with you
those are the people I appreciate the
most
you know it's not the guys who like
slander me because I started or whatever
you know it's that's what I appreciate
the most like yeah being happy and being
yeah just when I play I'm not like
feeling like it's job all day yes
sometimes it's super super boring yes
but which job isn't you know yeah I
think as well I guess remind yourself of
there's only Cinema relationships that
really matter to you it's your close
Circle to your family it's your
immediate friendship groups and everyone
else they have their opinions on what
you do but you don't really care about
them but if you really think about it
you don't care too much it sounds like
for you you've got a nice point where
you're happy with yourself you have to
feel around you are happy and they're
happy for you which is a rare thing in a
lot of circles and as you mentioned like
no matter what you do there's an element
of repetition getting good at data
actually there's a lot of fun in
repetition when you get really into the
weeds of something there's something
like the intricacies of learning
something at a high level of fun of
themselves so yeah

further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode
ready I want to ask you in terms of big
picture thinking I know you're you're
someone who likes to say why perspective
of Life overall how do you keep your
eyes on the bigger picture so to speak
in what is the bigger picture for you at
this stage of your career
well that's an interesting question Adam
uh I would say at the moment if we're
talking about in this specific moment
bigger picture it's more I look more
towards things outside of Poker if we're
talking in poker I kind of don't really
have something that I'm necessarily
going towards a more interested in yeah
things outside of Poker from a social
perspective uh soon to become a father
family this guy these kind of things uh
life experiences this this kind of stuff
that's more what my current bigger
picture is
yeah so to be honest I find it a bit
hard to to answer this question at this
exact moment if we talk about from a
career perspective obviously we're
always trying to yeah
improve our for example coaching skills
our poker skills but it's not the main
main focus at the moment maybe just
because like I said that I have some
things happening in my private life that
that draw all of my attention and then
probably after that I will have more
space to think about uh yeah where I
want to go with uh with my life but I
definitely think Cayenne gave a lot of I
think he gave like a little throughout
this two hours I hear like a master
class of
the uh like sort of a quantum physics
101 how to become successful I hear
every time abundance being not in a
state of lack focusing on the things
you're grateful for these are all like
one of the physics ways of of acquiring
success and I definitely feel like
if people had the idea of you that oh
this guy you know it's like blah blah
blah I would say
if they now hear how many shots you take
how many fills you take how many how
many times you put yourself out there on
the line I would say it's fair to say
that you've deserved the success that
that you now currently have because many
players who will be listening and who
maybe had that thought of you will be
like well did I put my money together
and just jump in a game where I was
pretty sure I wasn't Underdog no did I
took that risk where you said well I
can't win 2 million or I win two or I go
back to 200k what's the point I'm pretty
sure the majority did not take that risk
right so I think if you look at a high
risk High rewards the the classic you
deserve to budget to guy risky you got
high reward so yeah
that's uh yeah congrats to you yeah I
appreciate the kind words yeah like the
thing is like like I tried to say like
it's not all about the money it's just
all having some skin in the game being
confident and trying trying like
challenging yourself like because it's
very hard to stay motivated if you don't
challenge yourself you know it's like if
you're gonna stay in the same Lane long
enough for the time you're gonna get
bored it's gonna be like a automatic
robot
like a lifestyle where you can just have
a normal job instead it would be the
same like if you don't challenge
yourself and expand and try to like
different things like
I was praying no limit for many years
and then I started playing Five Star PLO
and I try to have a mix you know if just
to stay motivated and do things that are
different and try to yeah just try to
learn more all the time and I'm still
hungry you know and
at this fall when I was playing the
biggest like games all around and just
like playing like super it didn't give
me anything it didn't give me the
dopamine or it it didn't give me
anything but just like
it was super fun don't misunderstand it
was a lot of fun but when you lose and
you get knocked down knock down knock
down knock down
things are not that fun you need to have
like
you need to have something that always
builds you back up and then for me
struggling with motivation is when you
just feel like you're not good enough
and it it does something with your
confidence when you're losing a lot of
money it does something with you it's
wow I don't know how many folk players
I've talked to but they're just like wow
should I just give up or this and I've
never had that thought like maybe once
or twice throughout the seven years but
I've never been like should I just give
up or like this and this I've always
been like I know this is something I
want to do just pull it back together
take a break and
try to enjoy life in the same way as you
were talking about like sometimes you
need to focus on your life too because
if it's all about poker the whole time
you're gonna get crazy eventually you
know it's that's how it is yeah so how
does the
like reflecting again on the question of
data mask like what's the bigger picture
how does the big picture also change for
you because I feel like with I mean when
you grow right you my thoughts for sure
a certain thing was very important at a
certain stage of your life but then
later you find that something else is
important as you grow your perspectives
grow your experience grow so the big
picture keeps on changing the overall
big picture I think you use the word
happiness a lot right
yeah and what gives you happiness might
change so what you then focus on to
acquire happiness or what at that moment
gives you Joy changes so I feel like the
big big picture is always you know that
we live that we have nice experiences to
have a good day-to-day life be quote
happy even on a previous podcast someone
you uh labeled that as a fluffy word
happiness but let's just use it for it
yeah yeah the end goal the big picture
is always happiness but I feel like
they're more
the smaller goals is what kind of
experience or what can I put my time in
that could lead to a little mini
happiness that leads to the bigger
picture which is overall overall life
satisfaction let's let's call it that
way so we have happiness and then bigger
picture is the overall life satisfaction
how does that change based on obviously
three years ago what you considered to
be a useful experience for your bigger
pictures may be different than now
so I've always been a believer in
working hard like not always I'm always
gonna say always because I was a lazy
guy before but the thing is if I like
something I get super obsessed and I
like to work out it for me it's
enjoyment almost people will call it
work hard for me I enjoy the process
but the thing about me I've been
traveling so much and
uh I think I started traveling again now
beginning of August but then I was home
for three months and I my friends were
saying all along like I can't remember
the last time we were home for this long
you know and for me
I'm still gonna travel but the thing is
I'm I was so happy at home in our home
in Norway I love Norway man this is why
I don't move for tax reasons or whatever
people would say I I don't mind paying
it because I love them or I'm close to
my family friends you know and this
gives me happiness this is good for me
it's like it's a balance in life because
you're playing poker you're fighting
every day it's like very competitive and
then you get back to some stability you
know for me this is like a level of
balance which keeps me like it keeps my
foot on the ground and it's just it this
for me has happened with seeing my
friends and because these are friends
I've had for like 20 years you know it's
like and and when you're back home know
when you're traveling you're missing out
on birthday parties or my friends having
kids and this and my family going
through things you know it's like
for me this finding this balance has
always been difficult but in the
uh I remember after EPT Monaco I told
myself I'm gonna do less of the
traveling I'm gonna shorten the travels
I'm gonna focus more on what's good for
me I'm gonna
start working out more I'm gonna focus a
bit more on myself because I've been
giving so much of myself to Poker that
is the time to like
reevaluate try to reward yourself a
little bit and try to like get some
balance you know because yeah poker is
uh I love poker don't misunderstand it's
just
I also love myself yeah it can consume
you right at some point it can maybe at
some point you you spend so much time
in it that it kind of surpasses the
bigger picture cool exactly and then
there are some times where it's going to
be more intense than this and that but
yeah I do feel like you need to go
through a certain phase where basically
pokerist is The Big Short media picture
everything right yes you need to go
through that process you need to find
out how it is to grind because this is
the part of the learning process
everything you know it's it's everything
you did use remember if I could go back
10 years and see no let's say seven
years and see how stupid I was you know
it's just
it it probably wouldn't take it back
because I probably learned something and
probably made me to who I am today you
know I I couldn't see those things
before because when I was playing poker
I was by far the youngest you know
everybody's been playing for 15 10 years
you know I was I was always the youngest
I'm still kind of the youngest in the
High Roller scene but you know I'm I'm
feeling like I grew up in a certain way
where instead of like trying to show off
and trying to get gain some respect I
don't care too much about it I care more
about building friendships and I know
we're competitors at the poker table but
like being nice to people is not like a
yes some people will dislike my gimmicks
at the table you know I'm sitting there
trolling people in 100K where it's just
like nobody would ever do this like me
and Sam grafting having fun was just
like talking [ __ ] man fun wish I would
do the same in a 2K you know it's like
yeah you don't play it any different no
I tried to like for sure strategy-wise I
play way different but my table manners
will stay the same because I just enjoy
the social concept around it because if
everything gets too serious now my
motivation might slap up you know it's
like
especially with your experience right
you want to have fun actually when I was
in I actually was in Vegas this summer
and I saw what's her name is chess both
as the the streamer oh yeah and as she
was playing two five and then someone
says why is she playing two five and I
was like reflecting on the social aspect
of the game it was like a Friday night
nine o'clock she was playing two five
and I was playing 10 20 40. and I was
like if I would sit here from a fun
social respect perspective probably you
should sit at two five the way the 10 20
40 game is at the moment so I get it
right you know it's also it's yeah you
want some like the money the money
factor doesn't really matter for her
like she can play [ __ ] 200 400 500 1K
or something or to five but that's not
why why she's there
to the immediate irony of all this like
usually in there will be more serious
and more robotic behavior in lower game
than a super high game this is like
irony of the low game is very social
then like the medium and becomes a bit
like serious and then very high becomes
this is what we talked about earlier
yeah it's like a 10K now well
uh 500 now table life can look like
500 KML table life right exactly and
this is like the point like
okay I can sit there and grind my ass
off but for me this is not a thing I
want to do
for like a long period of time this is
this I've been through it all that I've
done it yeah and also I don't want it
that way would cost you way more energy
at least now you can the way you it's
also come to a more natural for you but
when there is a nice survival day we
also get more energy back right it's
like oh it's a more enjoyable experience
and okay [ __ ] it everyone had photos on
and uh uh yeah the time the time doesn't
pass by yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and uh
I I for sure use my headset too at the
poker tables when just like when there's
like a very serious point of the
tournament or the cash game where like
people are like this but at most of the
time I'm trying to like make the
experience both fun for me and for the
people around me because this is why we
all started playing because of the
complexity and fun it is it's like
social thing and like
this yeah it's easier to keep yourself
motivated and use less energy on it if
you're actually having fun yeah and then
you get the energy back you mentioned
that even you when you lose you get a
hit in confidence uh how does how does a
lack of confidence impact your game like
how does your game look different when
you are in low confidence and high
confidence that that you noticed I get
very self-critical like I become very
like am I really that good or is this my
entitlement and like because I've had
this like mental game problems with
before like very badly and then it I get
very self-critical can I really do this
and then there are points in my career I
just start feeling very bad for myself
but luckily I just like get out of it
fast you know it's like a very it's like
a one two day thing I just like feel bad
for myself I get like but luckily now
and then I just started thinking about
like I said what my sister told me was
like appreciate the things you have
around you just look just appreciate it
and just remember where it came from and
like you know this lesson helped me a
lot like
and she said like if you don't like it
anymore don't do it
yeah
and in terms of actual when you're
playing for example if you're low
confidence do you maybe not make the
bluff or fold a little bit more or do
you have no problem staying aggressive
so this is a thing that's very easy to
say which I can't say with 100
confidence but I would say it does
affect me a little bit yes of course I
would say I was not
I would not be a human if it didn't but
I I think in some sense it affects me
less
because I like like I said the money has
not always been the thing for me it's
like been like trying to really believe
what I do is the best
solution to the problem because if you
look at it like you have opponents you
have a problem and you're trying to
solve it
correct and then that's what I've I've
always been like I'm trying to find a
problem to solve okay maybe it didn't
pan out this time but in the long run
this is going to solve the problems way
more times than the other town you know
and this is the way I've been looking at
it so I think for sure it does affect me
well I I wouldn't be human if it didn't
but I think in some way maybe it affects
me less without I can't say that with
100 certainty but um
uh I would say like the most Financial
stable poker players would suffer less
with this problem because money is a
huge motivation for most people like
money does affect me a little bit I'm
not gonna say it doesn't because it does
for sure it does with everybody I just
think like these things affect me a
little bit less than maybe the general
population of Poker maybe I I don't know
maybe
yeah but like also like for example
because yes we're solving puzzles and
yes you're just trying to make the best
decision but then for example if I talk
from my experience you see the variables
but it's almost like when you're in low
confidence your first thought this sort
of right or you got the sort of right
but because of your low confidence you
don't trust it as much and then I can
suddenly think of something else or like
yeah intuitively I think this play is
good
but I'm not sure because you know I'm a
bit low confidence I would just do what
is quote quote normal it's kind of like
I would say there there's less there's
less creativity involved in my game if
I'm low confident then if I'm high
confident where I'm way more
trusting my gut and be like ah [ __ ] it I
know this is this is quite YOLO but hey
I feel like it's good let's do it yeah
that's the point like if you ask some of
my friends they'll like poker friends
they'll tell you I'm bipolars because
sometimes the two one let's say one two
three days four Afters after I can just
be like ah I'm just gonna grind it out
on 510 and do five and just chill out I
don't think I'm cut out for this and
then one week later they see me on 25 50
5100 again and just like hey what
happened to the grinder like ah I'm like
I [ __ ] it I think who was I kidding yeah
it's like I can get low confidence then
I'm like why am I kidding I'm way better
than this and this and this is like the
good thing about my entitlement maybe
like just maybe that's a good sign like
yeah it annoys me a little short while
and then I'll get back on my horse and
she's like this is where I belong I just
gotta
stabilize and just be prepared for
whatever happens you know it's just like
yeah I can be become a bit bipolar on
this I'm gonna admit it and my friends
will uh say the same thing I think I
think just the the nature of Poker kind
of who's out the bipolar tendencies in
people because of the swings right you
yeah you if you have just a normal
steady day to day
you don't have the ups and downs so your
bipolar character maybe comes out less
than in poker where you can suddenly get
a rush off winnings dopamine you feel
like a [ __ ] King and then the
opposite also happens so think naturally
we a poker players yeah they will show a
bit more of the bipolar tendencies that
I think everyone has to a certain degree
in inside of them I was also wondering
you mentioned that every time
you move up to the step you will get
slaughtered okay yeah and then pull back
down what in your if you if you if you
reflect which jump in Stakes was the
hardest for you and why was it so hard
and what were kind of some leaks in your
approach towards the game of poker that
you had to fix to establish yourself at
the next level
10 20 to 25.50 without a doubt it this
was just like impossible for me for some
reason
I was playing mostly the same opponents
but I was just getting slaughtered
and I found out like my biggest leak was
I was over bluffing against guys who
would over call
like this was like the biggest league
and I would continue to do it because in
my head it was the correct thing to do
because I I've been so used to it like
just hammering over people but then at
some point I realized like okay
these guys are gonna call me too much
and then what is the point like you
think it's good but maybe you should
re-evaluate and be like and this took me
like three or four times before it
happened like yeah it's just and uh
after a while after like a year I was
like okay maybe I'm doing it wrong maybe
I'm just like
I'll I'll go check and then I just
checked and I was like ah maybe I do
bluff this hand too much and it's like
oh I go check this over oh it's not that
you're not supposed to Bluff it that
much and then I became like okay if I'm
not supposed to Bluff it that much and
people over call me maybe I shouldn't
buff it at all you know this is like and
this is like what was it like hence that
people started showing up with so you
were like go and they would be call with
the hands you're like maybe they're
overcalling
there was I have one example of this
this happened after actually
um after I realized this but I was
playing 464 Daryl go on um 100 200 on
heads up on GG
and we've been playing some heads up
like and I think we're like pretty I
think I'm up a little bit in biased but
he's like winning the most money because
he's been crushing me on the bigger six
but then he was like
yeah there was this one hand where he
opened the button I called the big blind
and the Flop was like 10 9 deuce and I
had nine six and I went check call turn
was an ace
I wouldn't check anyone b75 and I made a
big raise with nice with like middle
pair which is like not a thing at all
but I thought like maybe he was just
like
yeah I was just trying to like make
because I felt like he was betting like
mergy with these types of hands like
this like yeah yeah the emerging merge
your hands if you fold some Equity
that's fine he sometimes calls worse
sometimes holds better yeah yeah I I I
can feel you man I can feel it yeah yeah
so I raised and he called and the river
was like an eight so like my bluff is
gonna be like Queen Jack and Jack eight
and seven eight right and
I ended up like thinking um okay I beat
jacket
I beat seven eight if he still has that
which is like sick merch let's let's get
it yeah and it was not like a merch now
I decided to make my middle pair into a
bluff on the turn this was like the
whole point I was making it I was doing
it because it's a fold on the turn you
can't call Paul is like the worst option
here
they ended up jamming and he went
through his timing and was like
and he had like 10 seconds left and he
ended up calling Kings
you know and then yeah so then I went to
check this I think you repelling or
something released the video of this
hand so the thing is like so I ended up
blocking this hand against the guy
which I still have this like because I
talked with him in Vietnam about this
and he was like yeah you've lost too
much he said I was like yeah I do it's
like yeah that's what I call and like my
my hand was not a race and his hand was
like a pure fold
correct exactly and that's what we're
discussing like
and I I just got like very self-aware
like maybe I'm just trying to outplay
people too much
and then this was like a syndrome I had
from before like I was trying to outplay
everybody every time instead of
especially people like kind of respected
like in their poker skill wise you know
it's not like I give them immediate
respect and fair after it's like yeah
just so I ended up like this hand was
just like oh dude I Bluff too much and
then I just quit the session and I was
like ah I I gotta work uh now I'm
falling back to the same trap like yeah
I'm trying to outplay everybody instead
of playing like the best form of Poker I
know
yeah and then out playing someone which
I guess then goes naturally sometimes
like I I I I usually say this to people
who maybe sometimes fight too much for
pots and especially versus opponents who
don't vote like I said usually I think
it's a good approach but then they
confuse sort of uh winning the pot with
making the plus V play because if you're
aggressive you're gonna win the
percentage-wise more often but it might
be that you're making a minus EV play
which is you know it's really weird
because winning the you you can make a
play that will never win you do pot
that's higher if either making the play
that might be you the pots a certain
percentage of the time yeah you're
winning you don't get the rewards you
know yeah red line but you're losing
more in Blue Line basically or yeah the
other way around yeah yeah exactly and
you mentioned Red Line blue line so I'm
sure you can you can uh relate to this
uh of course yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah no so this was like the big leak I
had like I was just trying to outplay
everybody like maybe people are
respected more or like hero called more
against them but
I think I've gotten way better at it and
it's just been like but it take it takes
some like self-exploring like you gotta
be
yeah it takes some self-exploring and it
hurts your ego to like realize and then
working on it it hurts because you've
been sticking to a system it's been
working for a long time and now you have
to like change it
you know what I mean and the ego can
definitely blind you in a spot like this
from the information because the ego
would just say wow that call with Kings
is so bad and it will stop the
reflective process yeah yeah
again it's like on the which
circumstances is King's a good call
reflect on it are these circumstances
actually present do I want to admit that
they are actually present and then you
look up maybe in the solver it's like
okay yes I will definitely be over
bluffing here so if if there's a spotter
over bluffing and someone makes a light
call I'm like yeah okay I got owned here
yeah that's uh exactly
two days after I realized like damn yeah
maybe I understand why I called now and
then because he's he had that perception
of me and it wasn't wrong at all it
wasn't wrong and then I talked to him
about it and then he was like yeah
but yeah he's like a fantastic player
also obviously he's uh
big time pressure all all throughout the
years yeah it's about time that he comes
on the pot in my opinion what do you
think
yeah maybe maybe I'll I'll shoot him a
text and say you're a decent guy
you are you nowadays also play a lot of
uh mpts right the High Roller especially
this year you've done very well
um if you had to chose choose between
cash games or entities which one would
you prefer and why would that have your
preference
I think I think cash games the
flexibility
the work whenever I want to situation I
wouldn't be forced to play during the
series and Sundays and I don't like to
be forced to do anything I I just don't
like the ultimatum thing is just like so
annoying I just don't like oh you have
to play this Sunday because or else you
can't play before next Sunday or you
have to play every day during the series
it feels very forced you know and that
one moves the fun out of it yeah and
that removes the fun out of it exactly
and then I try to play a mix of all the
things and then whenever I feel like it
I play and then yeah during the scoop I
played like maybe
two days or something
whereas I have friends who play every
day and just grind it out like
really hard workers obviously but then
they take vacation for like two months
you know yeah well I try to like keep it
a bit more stable instead and then yeah
so it's mainly from a lifestyle
perspective that you would say cash
games not necessarily from uh
uh interest in the strategy
so yeah it's like I don't know what do
you mean about strategy but it's like no
so like for example if you look at
the just purely playing a playing a
tournament towards playing cash games
like from uh how much it intrigues you
strategic oh oh oh oh oh that's what you
mean no the format how the format
intrigues you
no I actually do enjoy uh the strategy
of tournaments too I think it's very
interesting it's very complex and in the
beginning I was like trashing empathy
players but now I really have found like
a big respect for all of them there are
soldiers and they really wow they some
of them play really really well you know
before I was like wow I think they all
suck you know you know how cash game
players are you know that's how we do is
like yeah they all suck and we're way
better and well it's like a competition
thing but
and I was in to my surprise they're all
very very good especially in the higher
roller scene I was gonna say Obviously
in the higher on the scene for sure
right bigger feuds obviously attracts
also more semi Semi-Pro semi or more
recreational players yes and this is the
thing like I think the EV you gained
from playing tournaments is hot probably
higher I think instead of battling regs
on the highest Stakes on cash but also
like
you meet a lot of cool guys like many of
those guys who play tournaments are
really nice and smart and
cool guys like they really are and
everybody thinks it's so uptight and
blah blah blah but it really isn't they
really are talkative and friendly and
making friendly bets and talking about
random things and you know well
sometimes in like a 2550 game it might
get live it might get very boring and
robotic and everybody's like there to
play you know that was my general
impression from the limited amount of
time I played live obviously there are
some exceptions some guys are naturally
more social but I wouldn't say if I
would go there to have fun which was
actually definitely part of my
motivation to go uh that part was only a
little bit satisfied now it did help
because people would start talking to me
because they recognize me so I guess
that would that would be a conversation
started so I had more social interaction
than an other guy that maybe would sit
down at the poker tables but yeah that
was definitely uh from a life
perspective a bit disappointed
um yeah yeah understandable
I was curious what is the worst advice
you've ever been given or that you think
is popular advice given by the poker
community that you strongly disagree
with
this is a tough one
ah wow this is a very tough one
um
maybe being too strict with like
bankroll management is like
like trying to lock up way too much too
early
like being very like
let's say you're a beginning of your
poker career you win like 300K instead
of having your belief that you can
continue to rise up the stakes you just
like lock up 200 games and stay in your
lane
this is like this is something I would
say is like
a very bad advice in general instead of
like trying to
progressing and getting better and
better and trying to like
like yeah get get some respect and
confidence and trying to like
improve and make progress and these
things are very important for every
person because it's very easy to say
like this guy's a lock box and this
guy's a lock box but if you
if you just try I think it's going to
work out way many more times than it
isn't
like I think people are a bit too afraid
maybe
it's like
everybody doesn't have their they don't
need to have like their uh foot on the
gas the whole time like maybe I did a
bit too much but I feel like people are
very like
they're trying to like show off by
saying oh I don't do this because I'm
very strict with my money and I
I don't buy this because
I'm trying to take care of my money okay
but what is the point of earning a lot
of money
if you can't use it on things you like
if we gotten too responsible as a poker
player yeah it's like
I think the way it has become
is like people have seen like a lot of
players gone bust though and like just
you don't see them again and then
they get way too much over to the other
side kind of yeah because I definitely
think that you know for example I played
start to play poker what 13 years ago or
something some extra responsibility on
the average poker player was not a bad
idea but like like you're saying now
maybe we have now surpassed that point
to a certain degree that you know you
should only play on a table with a fish
you should own you should only move up
if you have 100 buys or something like
that or yeah yeah a bit more a bit more
cautious advice based on indeed all the
people that have uh that have lost
they've lost the battle I think it's
more about the fear of
people knowing you lost a lot of money
and they're the way they will look at
you kinda you know what I mean the
because
let's say money is like a social status
thing
you know let's say hypothetically yeah
but it for sure is and people will look
down on you
if you have like less money kind of and
I feel like in the at the poker table
people feel the same way
kinda you know and I I've tried to like
not talked about much much about money
and these things people are very curious
and then it's like a very personal thing
like my closest friend I tell them like
this I buy I'm gonna do this and this
and this is something else but like
I don't think it's anybody's business
I don't think it's like I don't think
it's cool
that people would ever do this I I mean
some of the guys that I respect like
I see a lot of like newcomers like
they similar of me but maybe a little
bit more responsible uh responsible
uh
these kids like are good kids like I see
from Norway like as I'm not gonna name
names now but I I talked to them
yesterday and then I I I'm gonna start a
study group with them and try to help
them achieve what they want and buy
action when they want to sell and this
is something I take pride in because I
want to help people
do the right thing like these are
younger kids you know and they're trying
very hard and I've I've been there and I
I wish I had the same type of person
that could help me when I was there you
know but I was always a lonely Lone Wolf
and then yes I for sure had some friends
who I talked poker with and they helped
me a lot that's not what I'm saying I'm
just saying like having like a kind of
good role model in poker is like it can
be very important for their progress and
if they do well I might do well buying
action you you know it's like a you
helped me you scratched my back I
scratch yours thing and and I enjoy the
process because I'm maybe I'm a bit
impacted like I'm I'm striving to be
very empathic or whatever but I that
those are the things I find like
enjoyable because
seeing people progress yeah I don't know
I I don't want to become like a coach on
full time but I feel like if I know them
well and they're Norwegian and they're
young and they're hungry it's like and I
can help them a bit that would be like
super awesome yeah I mean and how how
the coaching experiences for the coach
is very much dependent on the type of
student you have on so if you're just
taking on a bunch of students you will
have a lot more bad experience but if
you feel sort of intrinsically motivated
to help people who reached out probably
they have certain characteristics that
of people that you would like to help it
right review intrinsically the
motivation to try to help them out and
if you can share some of your knowledge
like you did today like I'm I'm sure
there's going to be so many people who
are going to listen to this and take
motivation from that so how does that
feel that you're motivating uh you know
the listeners in a strange way it feels
very good because I feel like if I can
help somebody become better that's
that's of course very nice it's like I
many people don't know these things that
I've said to you now so it's going to be
like a shocker for people who are here
the first time but it this the journey
wasn't always easy you know it's it's
been a struggle
it's been hard it's been tough It's been
mentally tough but you know what I'm
here today and it's like I think it's
Define me who am I who I'm who I am as a
person
and I I really enjoyed the process when
I think back of it it was like when I
was in the military the first three
months was living hell but when I think
back at it it was like wow it was
actually super fun you know
yeah a lot of a lot of these experience
that shape you in a certain way in
hindsight they're always they were
always worth it but in the moment
sometimes you feel like why the [ __ ] do
I keep putting myself in these kind of
positions exactly it's like what the
[ __ ]
or something this is just a waste of
time you know but at the end you just
like if you really want something and
you work hard and you push on you most
of the times you'll get there you know
it's like
but it's confidence is like super vital
if you feel like people around you are
bringing you down and these things and
then I mean sorry to say but most of the
times they shouldn't be in your life
it's just it's very bad for you as a
person support and confidence and like
love from the closest ones you have is
very important for every person
you know you need sometimes you need to
lean your head on the shoulder or
something just to like relax
because you're gonna get a lot of like
slaps in the face in the poker business
this is yeah and have and have someone
like for example you mentioned your
sister to tell you that everything is
going to be okay and look around you and
just change your perspective when you're
feeling down
yeah and my brother too like in the
beginning he was very skeptical but now
the last years he's been super
supportive and is showing it to my
nephews and nieces and they're all like
my whole family's super supportive
watching every time like these these
things they help they want to make me
better as well because I want to make
them proud of me yeah especially through
your niece his nephews you're sort of
not an example right so yeah so this is
just super cool and all my friends are
watching and then sending me pictures
and laughing and it's like super like
it's super cool I'm I must say it's like
I I don't like the attention too much on
this unless like I get the support like
it's like the support just makes it 10
times easier like yeah do I I mean to
have other people celebrate with you so
how was it because I know that very
recently you finally won your first
trophy right oh yeah I wrote if you
meant second fourth fifth third second
first finally yeah
dude it was such a relief I must say
dude if I had lost one more time I would
you know it does something with you
you're just like I need to win this
trophy I've said it in all I need to win
one of these Trophy and bring it back
and just like
it was something I had to do you know
this is why I started playing this you
get this trophy like just just show like
my family something this is something I
got like this is something I would
probably have for the next rest of my
life you know this is what I did like
this is some type of accomplishment it's
not about the money it's just like I was
a winner you know
for them I understand you don't have
that in cash games we should introduce
like quarterly leaderboards where cash
game players can win tour trophies what
do you think
medal or something that would be amazing
yeah but GG would probably be up for it
this is like a super I'm gonna get in
touch with Gigi straight away say okay
we need to start uh we need to start
introducing uh
guys get too little respect in today's
Community it's like all about the
tournaments but man some of these cash
game players like especially on the
highest tanks they're super super sickos
you know and they start playing
tournaments and just start crushing
they're just super good
in the past probably before your time
you used to have a side poker table
ratings and then you could win badges I
don't know if you ever heard of it but
it was kind of similar and you would you
would Chase like a certain badge like oh
I finally I finally have this badge now
on my profile and you it would really
give like some sort of motivation I
think actually stars as like a batch
that shows how many hands you have I
sometimes see like yeah I have on
purpose like I'm a 500 hand player you
know I have like the opposite but
sometimes you see guys 10 million hands
like what the [ __ ] yeah we can see with
the EPT title and everything yeah yeah
so so they're already thinking about
something like this and I definitely
think I think it's definitely good let's
say for example they could have like uh
the guy who had the highest aggression
Factor over the last quarter that guy
should also get rewarded you know so you
can yeah
I'm gonna make it a bit a bit more fun I
think for uh for us cash game players
because yeah in the end you don't you
don't get a trophy I mean I would love a
trophy to be honest cash game players
don't get enough recognition this is
just how it is it's just I mean it also
makes sense right I mean tournaments are
away easily here glamor fighting through
the market yeah yeah yeah then for
example if if you tell your your family
hey I'm on the final table and they can
actually look at it and some sort of
enjoyment but hey I'm playing in this
live cash game like nothing happens did
he win already no yeah they don't know
what's going on man they're just like
the funniest thing about me being on TV
they're just trying to coach me after
this is like the best part they're just
like oh why didn't you do this I was
like yeah but you can see the cards it's
kind of easier for you you know yeah
already it helps if you can see the cars
it doesn't give you a buyer's opinion oh
really
yes this is like but you know what the
support and everything is great and uh
my friends around me everything is it's
super cool and it's yeah I'm really
enjoying the moment yeah no it's like
the last year or something I've really
been enjoying myself and uh I feel like
I'm on a good path to like not just to
become a better poker player but also
like a better person for people around
me and you know it just
yeah I think character is a lot like
it's way more than poker you know if
you're like
a stable good person outside of the
poker table it might just help you calm
your nerves when you're playing you're
just at your A game way more frequently
than you usually would be
I mean it's also and this kind of what I
get from your story is when you have
your life in order and you feel great
and you go sit down at the poker table
and you can just enjoy it because you
don't need anything out of it you
already feel good about yourself that's
when good performance happens if you
need poker success in order to feel good
about yourself or something like that
then imagine how much is suddenly on the
line and this increases pressure
enormously and usually the more we are
in a state of lack oh like I really need
this the more frustration comes up and
the more actually the opposite will
actually happen so I listening to your
story I think this is definitely either
constantly or unconsciously a very good
uh strategy or or quality of yours Adam
I have a question for you as well we we
just touched on a little bit maybe poker
players have become too responsible in
your experience working with players do
they usually have to work on becoming
more responsible or are there some
people that kind of surpass it and like
listen you're being so responsible you
let's say for example you have very
rigid structure every day but you're
you're just miserable like there's
there's both ends of the spectrum I can
imagine
yeah I think as Cayenne touched on a lot
of players go one of two ways I say the
majority lack structure they lack a kind
of routine they lack being professional
and they're still learning how to
optimize their lifestyle so to speak
then you get the other guys who go with
all the other way and they're so rigid
saw
um by the minute and everything's in a
structure that they need to loosen up so
my kind of ways if you're the over a
structure person you just need to work
on create more flexibility learn um
almost a bit more relaxed but a lot of
players are still working on creating
that structure and I think sometimes
you've got to play with extremes I think
if you're someone that's the average
poker player is generally fairly young
let's say he's living by himself he's
got very little responsibilities he's
maybe came out of school or a job a
graduate and he's just been a free free
kind of guy now he sits down to play a
computer game that he likes and he's
getting money involved there's a lot to
figure out to create this this kind of
person this Avatar into a professional
version themselves so uh I think
sometimes you've got to go almost too
far I think Cayenne isn't mentioned as
well he's went rigid working too hard
grinding too hard and you've almost got
to play around with those variables and
push those to extreme sometimes to find
that kind of Middle Ground how do you
get the most out of yourself I think the
main thing is how do you create a kind
of workflow or a system for executing
your performance but also enjoying your
life so I think is that this kind of
interplay between the two so I think
it's a
it's a challenge for a lot of players I
think most players would be on the
on-destructure side but the ones who are
too structured you guys listen you know
who you are need to listen up uh see
I've got a question to ask because I
know a lot of these conversation's been
around learner lessons and you've been
someone who's been picking lessons from
all different areas of your life as
you've been growing so I'm curious to
know what's the most important lesson
that poker has taught you
wow oh that's a tough one yeah I mean
we're on the entitlement thing and I
think in the whole in my whole life I've
felt entitled I feel like deserving and
these things and I think maybe poker
taught me like
maybe you only deserve what you actually
work hard for and are passion for and
like you work for you you're not
entitled to more things than other
people like because it's very easy to
feel bad for yourself and feel like I
deserve this and this this like I talked
about earlier I think my biggest lessons
have been like
because he I had a tendency to be like a
bit like maybe
arrogant-ish I would say like I could be
like treating people differently like
this but like I think the thing it
taught me like treat people the same way
and like treat people the way you want
to be treated yourself I think I learned
that by loosening up my entitlement and
my ego a little bit and just trying to
be like
because you know at some point you're
just gonna be feel like you're way
better than everybody else and you're
gonna feel sorry this is like a circle
like a very bad Circle to get in and
in many years I would say like even
growing up I had this problem and I
think like
finally I'm moving a bit out of it yes
sometimes I have it still I think it's
like in a healthy way now it's hard to
explain but it's like it's definitely
days where I'm
back to normal again but I feel like
I've learned like
it's important
to be a good person as well as a good
poker player like it's like it has both
things like you shouldn't really reflect
on your achievements on other people
like just shove it in their face or like
showing people you have more money than
them or some these things have before
because I wanted to give a big [ __ ] you
to everybody who doubted me you know it
was like a I was kind of hurt my ego was
very hurt you know it's like and I think
I learned like
it's only important for what people you
care about and people around you think
and just everything else is noise kinda
but I think my entitlement my ego I
think everything has been
I've been slapped in the face so many
times I think I learned my lesson kind
of am I it yeah I think that's been my
biggest struggle in a lot of my life and
I think now I'm finally getting to a
better place I'm still working on it I'm
not uh it's all about progress not
Perfection and then that's what I try
every day to do like try to treat people
well and help people when I can and you
know just this is the stab actually
yeah I think that fits into your overall
Evolution as a person I think you
mentioned in the start the conversation
that you had a chip on your shoulder so
to speak when you started you wanted to
prove that I was wrong that was
motivating you I can't let them I can't
let them say I'm feeling I'm gonna show
them I'm gonna do it so this creates a
kind of fragile ego which is trying to
uh prove to others it almost tries to
protect itself with its own constructs
it's like I I'm gonna show other people
I deserve this I'm good enough and very
quickly you can create this kind of
entitlement expectations to
overcompensate for your yeah almost like
insecurity around that but as you've got
more fulfilled more successful you're
more extreme yourself you don't need the
external metrics you don't need to prove
to anybody you're much more happy in
yourself and as a result that naturally
that need for entitlement that needs for
expectations things go well is just
lowered and lower it's to the point now
where it's like it's just background
noise it's obviously still there some
degree as you mentioned I think it's
good to know that most successful people
in life generally have some form of ego
some form of high confidence some form
of I will back myself to get out of a
situation and beat competition doesn't
that's intertwined with a high level
competitor so you hold on to that but at
the same time it's balanced it's not a
nice place where it's not toxic so you
mentioned a few times Well building your
character I love this analogy I almost
think Life's a video game and we're all
11 about character so I'm interested to
know um what sort of character traits
you feel like you you've formed over the
years which you're most proud of
so I've always been like a joker and
having fun and just like
I've been
I've been basically I've been that all
my life and I think I was being very
irresponsible when I was younger I was
um very self-centered I think I was very
very self-centered
um I think also I was struggling to find
out when I should be serious and when I
should be not be serious and I think all
of these like bad traits have been
turned into good traits like I can be
the clown but I can also be serious when
it's needed
um yes I can be self-centered but I can
also show empathy and try to help people
around me you know it's like and the
irresponsibility like I have never had
to think about anybody else than myself
and my family but now I think like I try
to spend more time to try to like Focus
what people around me also needs from me
and vice versa and just like
yeah just to be good to people around me
and not be so self-centered because
there was a period of time I was
thinking about nothing else than poker I
was not showing up the birthday parties
I was not like you know I was just my
life was poker and now I think sometimes
I can just like
say okay
I'm gonna travel home a few days later
earlier instead I'm gonna play one
session less and I'm gonna prioritize
this because it means a lot to them that
I'm coming and these are my friends this
is my family you know it's like the all
these things have been like
very important for me like later years
and I think it's all about like growing
up and seeing like it's a perspective
thing like you know okay we have poker
and we have a lot I'm also supposed to
live I can't be just like the poker
player all all day all year you know and
I think these are like the traits like I
felt like my character has built all
over over the years I was like usually
very I'm still a bit lazy I'm not gonna
say but like I would have like a very
I'm not dirty but I would like it would
be not very clean and I would be very
lazy about these things but now I've
been like very important to like go work
out sometimes like just not not ever go
to the gym that would be like that's
what I used to do I would just play
instead and be yeah I don't know I just
feel like I've been growing a lot since
my last years and I was like
acting very immature I would say at uh
yeah I think the last
maybe like three years I've been like
maturing I think covid helped me a lot
when I had to like self-reflect a lot
and it wasn't a lot of social thing I
think covet helped me a lot and before
that I can be very immature I could be
very like
a bit arrogant and yeah very
self-centered and be like I'm better
than you and like you said fragile ego
and then
I wanted to prove myself and then now
that I see it's like these things are
all noises I'm just trying to feed my
own ego and then I tried to focus more
on the good things in my life and just
take care of those things because it's
way more important to have good things
around you than
money wealth and Status that's the way I
feel it at least I just yeah I think
it comes to a point where money won't
make you happy anymore it's just I'm not
saying I'm that rich and that's happened
or anything I'm just saying how much
money do you actually need you know how
much like uh
confidence loses do you need from people
how much recognition do you actually
need you know it's like
what you actually need is to have good
people around you and if you have good
people around you it's going to reflect
them when you play poker or doing your
job or other things you know these
things have like
light on me and like being like yeah
I've kind of yeah understood those
things more and more I'm I'm still like
like I said it's still progress It's not
Perfection I'm just trying to work on
these things and yeah I think that's
been good for me
yeah I think it's interesting as well
with you all these character traits when
like new character traits that you've
developed you've almost just like
fine-tuned the ones you've got I think
that's often the way like life works we
think that things are like good or bad
so for example like being self-centered
that's good for focusing yourself
studying hard putting yourself away and
learning stuff but if you push that too
far you become selfish you don't give
your time to other people or help people
also being serious can be great and
certain context but it could also be a
uh a negative you always mentioned being
the clown the fun guy to be around great
and sensitive situations but you can
push that too fast I think sometimes
like we mold our character and it's not
like black and white or this these
traits are good these are bads we become
a version of myself that allows us to
live the life we want and to fine-tune
when our character Traders come to uh
one-sided so to speak some clean out
balance between uh the character traits
so you mentioned self-reflection which I
was interested about you said you've
been able to self-reflect especially
during cover times what is yourself
reflection process look like how do you
uh go internal to look at how you're
acting and operating what some practices
that you've that's been useful for you
now so the thing is I had like uh during
covet I had like a big talk with people
around me and this this I was starting
to get very unhealthy my life was
yeah you could just notice I wasn't very
happy I was waking up at like 2 3 P.M
again and I'm being very late and so
after a while uh I moved back home for
like two months during covet because
there wasn't it wasn't that easy finding
an apartment in Oslo but then when I
moved to Oslo and during covet I started
working out while I was playing I was
playing a lot and working out like just
focusing on my mental health because
when you're unhealthy and generally I'm
happy it does something with your brain
that you don't sleep well you do bad
things and then you just go into like a
bad Circle and then you just make those
bad things even worse but I think like I
started like I lost a lot of weight and
I tried to like work out and I
everything reflected on my game after I
noticed like
they say like if you change your way
into a life where you're happy you will
also play better and be better and in
every aspect and then I think during
covet that's the time I was I was
getting a routine I was going to sleep
at 3am every night and waking up at 11
and I had this like perfect routine for
like a year and everything in my life
just got way better after it was just
yeah so I had a lot of time to suffer it
took some time to get there it was like
instantly when I moved in I had to do it
but
after some period it got way better and
then yeah
I started seeing girls and I started
being like social and I you know instead
of like just playing poker all the time
and just yeah
um yeah I think of it was that
interesting time where it hit the brakes
on life and we all had that time to go
out what are we doing with our lives how
am I how am I operating and we had a lot
more time by ourselves we couldn't
socialize couldn't go doors and we did
have more time with our own dogs so it
sounds like for you you're really um saw
some of the maybe problems you were
having with your lifestyle your mental
health overall and you realize your
lifestyle wasn't quite in alignment with
the person you wanted to be on your
goals so you spent more time working on
that creating good sleep habits eating
better going to the gym more and all of
a sudden you've got happier version and
perform a better yeah things are names
if you need to neglect our health and
almost like watch our health suffer a
little bit before we realize it's been a
second or health mental health physical
health is so important it drives
everything that we do our performance
our happiness our enjoyments is driven
by that so it sounds like you did a good
period of a Corvette to uh realign that
so you said earlier that you identified
yourself as a lone wolf which I think
you are the first guest we've had on the
show who would identify themselves as a
lone wolf what do you feel like has made
you uh show the poker path of learning
and studying Improvement obviously
you've had Partners somewhat by yourself
I know you're a social guy very friendly
why would you say you have been a long
wolf throughout your career
so
the thing is I've always had good
friends in poker but I would generally
not discuss that much with
players I I've had some friends uh that
was asking me to study and join the
study this this but during my time I was
like I have to do this by my own because
if I know how I am as a person I'm very
lazy so I'll just rely on what they do
and not not go through the process
myself I had to do it myself because
most of the time it's helpful let's say
two people go to the gym it's like very
common like two friends they go to the
gym together and help each other out I'm
like the complete opposite if I do that
I slack you know I know I am as a person
I start slacking I start like talking
instead I'm not like a lone wolf in a
form of like social way like with
friends or anything but like when I have
to do something I need to be very
focused on doing what's right for me you
know this is where I need to be
self-centered and doing what's best for
me you know and over the years it's
gotten better and it's been like okay
you do this I do this and we we see how
it gets we check results and we do this
and see how the hands are and we help
each other out but like during those
process years like I I was working on my
own I need to find out I need to find my
own way kinda because I was still young
I needed to like see how I am as a
person see how my public skills are and
then I could sometimes like very rarely
talk to friends about poker hands or
this and this but normally no I would
just um
uh most for my own just like yeah work
for myself and then experience I did a
lot of experimenting with like cool
lines and cool things to do and then
yeah this is yeah I don't know this is
just the way it's been better for me
it's a bit self-centered yes because but
that's what worked best for me you know
that's yeah I think it's understanding
that what how you learn how you get
better how you improve it sounds like
for yourself you're Germany associable
friendly guy but at the same context
where you actually like to learn and
study and go deep by yourself and really
think for yourself so uh for you you
could quickly see like if you had a
study partner or someone to learn with
yes there's some benefits of that but
also you like going deep internally by
yourself see I think it's a good
self-awareness to figure that out it's
quite pretty rare I think as an
attribute in terms of players being able
to have success with that approach most
players do almost hit a wall I know
you've got friends around you who um you
do talk strategy with some I'm sure
you're not like fully and Lone Wolf in
it but overall your approach has been
back yourself I've got the confidence to
figure things out I'm curious to know
like when you couldn't figure things out
let's say you're having a rough patch of
your career and you maybe uh you were
trying to figure out a strategy to beat
a game but it wasn't really how much
success how did you keep confidence
during that patch and did you uh during
those patches did you reach out to other
players to get some inputs to uh to give
yourself some insights no I'm too proud
so I would lose sleep instead so I would
lose sleep think about it for three more
hours and then fall asleep wake up one
hour later and do the same thing and
just annoy myself with it yeah I just
yeah it's like self pain inflicted was
like super stupid when I think of
adapter but it was just like
there are a very few amount of friends I
reached out to like
ESPN and preben and those guys like
Norwegian and the you walk him and those
guys
and 2000 kilo which the Renee knows and
then uh yeah I would talk some hands
with them and tell them about what how
things were going and these things but
most of the time I would be just like
this this is something I have to go
through by myself and um I think this is
the best way because I don't want to be
like taking advantage of them being
helpful and trying to work hard on this
you know I I would feel bad basically so
and uh yeah so I just decided like
this is something you need to do for
yourself you can take it as a matter you
can just lay down on the floor and cry
about it no
yeah it's obviously worked out well for
you you find a way to uh solve your own
problems to get yourself out of Dark
Horse to figure out the solutions to uh
anything that's keep me aware of the
year so yeah it wasn't easy and
sometimes I've gotten help don't
misunderstand for sure I've gotten help
but only from the friends I close
closest to me and that I trust with this
like things
um
and if it wasn't for them I probably
wouldn't be here right now and I'm fully
aware of that and I've always tried to
help them back and if they need anything
I would always like
you know it's like
you have your friends and then you have
your real friends like good good friends
and these type of friends are like the
guys I would always help and trust and
you know it's loyalty is a very big
thing for me so if I feel like this is
going both ways I I would like help them
in any manner I could this is basically
how I work yeah yeah it sounds like
you've got a close circle around you
people you trust rely on can help you
with your problems so I though we say
lone wolf it's more like your approach
to strategy whereas I'll figure things
out myself rather than yeah when it
comes to Poker yeah yeah most important
things yeah but overall you've got a
network around you that supports you
you've talked a lot about like how
important is it your friend's cheering
you on your family cheering you on so
you've got this nice Network in a
different way a lot of players we spoke
to have the network in the kind of Poker
Circle you've got more like a life a
life cycle around you supporting you
cheering you one which is it's helped
you all the way so uh yeah I want to be
respect for your time I know we're
approaching the three hour mark So final
question I have for you is what would
you like to be the main takeaway that
the audience goes away from this
conversation with
ask those questions uh the main takeaway
is to uh try to have
high level of self-belief and don't like
even though people around you try to
pull you down you're just like
forget about it try to be around good
people like you trust and they're
they're helpful and you can help them
and try to build the community we can
make you grow as a PR not only as a
player but as a person because if you're
not happy with yourself you probably
won't be playing your best game of poker
either and always try to be serious and
focused when you're doing it just like
when if you do something do it because
you like it not because of the money
because if you do it for the money you
probably will get bored of it or you
probably won't reach the goals
at all or as fast as you wanted to if
you if you really like it you should put
your heart and soul into it and um but
like it honestly it's not for everybody
it's it's it's tough business it's super
tough it's super competitive you play
with
I mean many of the poker players I've
met are like the smartest people I know
and these people are smart and they're
cool and they're nice and just yeah try
to be focused and um
be ready for a hell of a journey and
you'll get a lot of slaps in your face
for sure
this is just
uh maybe not all of you but most of you
will and then take it as a learning
experience and um yeah
that's it actually I don't know and try
to see the big picture
and yeah a future EV is the most
important thing
that was a great summer you did a very
good job of recapping the whole main
topics there so I yeah I'd like to thank
you for your time I know it's been a
long conversation today and it makes me
very inspirational for everyone
listening following on your journey it's
been far from a straight line to the top
you've overcome a lot of obstacles but
you've done it with a smile on your face
with happiness enthusiasm so uh yeah I'm
definitely listen back to this episode
myself and take some lessons so yeah
thank you for your time we appreciate it
and yeah see you soon it was very nice
talking to both of you and thank you for
having me on and uh yeah it was uh I
didn't felt like it went that fast three
hours already ah nice uh yeah I felt
like uh yeah it was very fun and uh now
I got my story out I'm probably gonna
get a lot of questions but
so that's it so I'll be ready to answer
them and thank you for having me on as I
said and it was really nice
that's a wrap thank you very much Kaya
mokri for sharing your wisdom I really
enjoyed this podcast Adam what were your
main takeaways
yeah it was a super fun episode today
and some of the things I wrote down were
around his wrist of rewards kind of we
calibrate stuff he's very much on the
philosophy of taping risks learn to
handle those put yourself in situations
over and over again and when I first got
in the conversation I thought there was
going to be an element of maybe
confirmation bias getting lucky with the
shot takes but reality was the opposite
it was almost like everything he tried
every risk he took almost backbited and
this didn't deviate him it didn't deter
him he just kept going for it because
he's very calculated knowing the
long-term EV of his decisions and he was
able to handle this so it got me
thinking as I was listening how do you
tolerate risk how do you deal with risk
and one element is a level of acceptance
of the risk of like when things go badly
can you accept the outcomes that come
with that and then the next thing is
have you got the right corporate
mechanisms and resources to handle it I
think for him it was very obviously did
and he's a very resilient person who uh
every time I tried to ask specifically
what would you do when you were losing
it was almost like oh well I just
brushed myself up off and get on with it
and just go again and go again as this
level of I we just keep going this I'll
show up over and over again which I
would call in a minute resilience either
you had that as a trait always he's
built that into his and a hard way as
he's went for his career another one
confidence always backs himself always
has this High belief in himself which he
mentioned as his his own take away for
the audience having high self-belief in
yourself even others around you are
telling you that you can't I think it's
a real real strong one another one would
be the growth mindset that he has and
always learning he mentioned every time
he plays tough opponents he doesn't
really care if he wins or loses he's let
alone he's there to get better he's dead
and proof uh rather make money in the
short term which I think is a real I
think I've heard this like from a number
of the guests like they've got this in
its ability to learn from players but
also uh to score the Dynamics of playing
uh I mean I'm here to learn not yet to
win the short term I think Sunny was
another guest that comes to minds and
then the big picture I thought was
really interesting just remind yourself
of what is the big picture what am I
doing this for and for him it's like the
the big journey of achievement stuff but
also to be happy to have fun and to
become a better version himself on the
journey so I think we went on a very
nice story arc we started off with kind
of the joke and fun side and then we we
understood exactly how we got to where
he was and the character traceability I
think it's a really nice overall podcast
episode hopefully a lot of a lot of good
nuggets for the audience to take away as
well how about yourself right now what
the main things your return
yeah the the confidence thing actually
actually I quoted myself I don't know
how narcissistic self-centered this is
but the act of confidence come first the
feeling comes after I wrote down which I
think I said not him that's what I said
maybe a little bit narcissistic but then
you also asked him like do you have any
fear going in and then he said no and
there were I think a couple of reasons
for that first of all the Trust In
himself right he backs himself he
focuses on his qualities instead of his
opponent's qualities and then when he
sees I think he meant to Ivy Antonio's
David Jones or whatever just read like
this and I'm playing against humans okay
they're gonna make mistakes as well but
I back myself I beg my strategy and if
reality turns out that actually my
strategy wasn't good enough so I lose
then it also doesn't matter because then
I will learn and with that new things
that I learned I will come back and
eventually I will be a winner so that's
kind of the cycle that he can keep on
going through and I'm sure there's a lot
of players who listens with admiration
and who have trouble overcoming this
fear so yeah fear is just going to be
part of it you have to kind of push
through it and yeah the only yeah the
only the only way together get through
fear is yeah right through it through
fear through it that makes a lot of
sense
um also he talked a lot about the value
of playing against better players
because better players will point you
out where you will have short comments
in your game and then if you reflect on
that they keep on putting you into spots
you can reflect on your own game he gave
I think the example of uh 464 where he
learned the lesson well if I'm over
bluffing and someone is over calling
maybe I shouldn't be over bluffing right
and he saw him calling with a hand that
should be a fault or at least if we just
follow the traditional solver but then
again he showed up with a bluff that
shouldn't be a bluff so who was right
well probably in this case Daryl is
right as he already said but it's the
ego that likes to point out what a bad
call with Kings and that you don't
reflect on your own player like well if
he goes with Kings under which kind of
circumstances there's a good call well
if I'm over bluffing Emma over bluffing
is then the question but that's a
question towards yourself which is often
a bit harder to do because the ego
doesn't really like that we also talked
a lot in the beginning as well about
when solvers applied and that the first
thing we have to ask ourselves yeah okay
which against who am I actually playing
because the more tough your opponent the
more the tree will start to look like
the solver because he's very studied and
I think he mentions when he plays
three-handed against David Jones Linus
obviously he will follow the solver uh
but if he then plays live versus we're
weaker opponents it's just a matter of
just figuring out what they have and
make vacuum decisions uh with your hand
we also actually touched a little bit on
how then learning changes especially the
necessity when you go play mtts because
there's so many variables the tree is so
complex you cannot be so nuanced and
again like the bigger picture having a
more holistic not what do I have to do
on this board in this specific situation
with this text size but no what are
General risks that I can use how tembv
plays how 20 BB plays how 30 BB plays
and then from there with that knowledge
kind of try to do what do you think is
correct based on the concepts that you
made for yourself in these situations
okay we cannot we cannot know everything
right poker is a game of mistakes so if
you make a little bit less mistakes on
your opponents you will have an action
therefore you will win nobody plays
perfect all right then we're kind of the
