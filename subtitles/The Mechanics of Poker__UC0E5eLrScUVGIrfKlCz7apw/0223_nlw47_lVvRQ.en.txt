we will be playing some serious Street
poker if you enjoy Street poker like
this video make sure to rate my hands in
the comments down below and let's get
into the first hand in which we get delt
pocket aces we Face a limp under the gun
from a recreational player and a
professional player who isolates the
recreational you would say Okay three
bet straightforward but I actually
decided to Flat call reason being that
the recreational is very aggressive and
has a shorter stack I think there is a
very good chance that he will now come
over the top and then the professional
will be stacking with a way lighter
range than if we would three bet
ourselves also with this spr I think
it's fine to let him in with a hand like
King 10 offit have him flop top pair and
go broke all right so villain
unfortunately decided to call instead of
reras what we would have liked to see
and the Flop is check 34 think easy
check recreational checks and we Face a
one3 B I think we have two options here
raising is definitely fine but my
modotto is always with recreationals you
want to give them an option in trying to
do something stupid so therefore I
decided to just call and unfortunately
villain only decides to call now the
turn is where things become interesting
from strategy perspective should we
continue our plan and give options to
the recreational to let him do something
stupid or should we now take the lead in
the hand I think I think actually
checking here is a pretty big mistake
because this way imposition professional
will play quotequote perfectly is going
to be pot controlling with hands like
King Jack and let this guy off the hook
if he has a hand like pocket sevens with
a diamond for example and he will just
be betting a hand a range that's versus
which Ace is obviously not a bluff
catcher but Ace is at least not very
happy okay and it's going to get checked
around quite often uh and we miss a lot
of value so I actually decided to lead
out myself making sure that it doesn't
get checked around making sure to
extract some value from the recreational
player we can actually argue sizing here
I think betting pot like usually you
don't really want to be betting too big
when the diamond completes in a spot
where both players can have a lot of
flushes so from a theoretical
perspective and I kind of saw this 10
and I didn't even consider I think
leading bigger but I actually think in
this situation this betting pot is
actually a fine strategy I think the
recreation will now stack us with quite
a lot of Jacka par plus draw combo draws
Etc and I think the the professional
player is going to play quite honest
versus This Bat where now if he maybe
calls comes over the top we're in quite
a dicey spot whereas if we just pot he
calls and the rec for example comes over
the top I think we have a pretty easy
fault and if he calls we probably could
block the river or check and reevaluate
the situation so I think potting is
better than blocking but I think
blocking is by far better than checking
the recreational ships all in now if the
professional does anything I
think it's going to be quite close let's
say it calls I probably call one check
fold River I think that's probably fine
if he comes over the top I think we just
have an easy fold uh he does just fold
so we don't have a tough decision I
think we now have a snap call obviously
with our pocket
aces and villain shows up actually we
run it twice
and villain shows up with king queen so
this is actually a great example of a
hand that we allowed in Pre flop and
actually we allowed in on the Flop as
well obviously he was drawing pretty
dead now he did Bing the best turn in
the deck and let's say we would have
checked and it would have gone check
check because he did fall so most likely
he was going to check right River would
have been a six we would have checked
and he would have bet and move probably
fold it but the main point is now by
Leading the turn we force him to pay
with the hand like this so This Is The
Moment guys to rape my hand is this pure
Wizardry or should we go back to the lab
and study more so we prevent making this
mistake in the future in the next hand
we have Ace queen off suit in the small
blind and we decide to Flat call you
guess it there's a recreational player
in the big blind flop comes Queen 97 we
could actually lead out here I think if
we have hand like king queen or queen
Jack I think leading is is perfectly
fine however with a screen I think I
prefer checking slightly more the
recreational checks and now the
professional checks as well turn is a
jack I think there's only one thing to
do here which is to bet our hand with a
recreational is who is in the pot who's
most likely going to overall here I
think in theory we might check our hand
again but I think the recreation is
going to overall I think he's going to
overrate hands like 98 he's going to
overrate hands like Queen do suited
going to overrate maybe a hand like Ace
Jack yeah I think betting is perfectly
fine also sizing I think is perfectly
fine he now decides to MIM raise us on
the turn and it is up to us now I'm not
too thrilled about the situation but I
think
folding is I don't want to say out of
the question because obviously King 10
108 are the nuts and when recreationals
make a MIM race like this it's usually a
bit on the stronger side but it's given
a random factor and the fact that we
only need to be good 19% of the time
time you know I think calling is fine
and kind of reevaluating the river but
most likely folding to a lot of action
okay because like I said I think there
is while he can have maybe a hand like
two pair maybe a hand like Queen 10 or
king queen I can definitely see this
playing this way some of the time as
well I do still think that a strait is
definitely in his range as well so we
call and our river is the eight of
Hearts which is pretty interesting his
two pairs now are significantly
decreased in value it's unlikely that
he's going to have a flush by the way he
played his hand if he had a flush draw
it could have been maybe one with the a
of hearts that he raced on the turn like
ace of hearts or something but obviously
that's reduced because we have the a of
Hearts if he did have a hand like pocket
sevens a straight came in and a flush
came in so that's obviously not great
for him so I actually decided to turn my
hand into a bluff and dunk B with kind
of the thought that on average I think
recreational players are a little bit
afraid of flushes and I think we have
enough money behind to put some pressure
on him right it's a nice nice little
overb here mainly mainly trying to put a
lot of pressure on like the two pair
region and maybe like pocket sevens now
obviously if he has King 10 you know or
if he already had 108 this is just
putting money on fire it's very
debatable whether you think this is a
great blade hand so let me know what you
think is this pure Wizardry or should we
go back to the lab are we just toring
money on fire he did decide to call he
did think about it for a little
while and he showed up with Queen 7 now
obviously if he calls Queen 7 this is
literally donating
369 uh 69 to my opponent because we want
him to fold this kind of hands if we're
going to be front jamming the river
right maybe wrong candidate recreational
player like there are certain
recreational players definitely the one
more nitty ones that are definitely
capable of folding I don't think I had
much information on this recreational
player if he is just very crazy I
definitely don't think we should do this
but I felt like I kind of got sucked in
on the turn and on the river I couldn't
really help myself but let me know what
you guys think in the comments down
below next hand we raise it up with Ace
Jack suited face a three bet from the
button and we decide to call flop is
356 and I decide to come out for a
little donkey donkey now this board in
general is going to favor the out of
position quite a lot because our range
when we call a three bet out of position
is very pocket pair heavy Deuces until
ninth for example which are very
incentivized to lead on this board the
button has more of an advantage on High
car boards because he will have hands
like king queen off King jack off a jack
off a stand off stuff that we on average
will not have okay now in a vacuum Ace
Jack of clubs I think is fine check
let's say ace Queen it's probably a hand
that would never lead and then Ace Jack
I figured with the clubs and the boards
being pretty favorable for us I decided
to go for it but I definitely wouldn't
have hated to check definitely one of
the first non-m made hands that I would
consider checking fin calls and we see a
turn now the turn is a seven I think
this only improves our initial range
Advantage four is now made a straight
Seven's now made a set eight and N now
turned extra Equity so in game I figured
that my strategy here would be to just
continue to B my range so that's kind of
what I did I fired out another small bat
just by putting a lot of pressure on the
overcard region like hands like Ace King
Ace queen king queen suited all that
type of stuff villain decides to call
and we now see River in the river is a
deuce which you know obviously an eight
and a nine would have been range
improving but there is a small chance
that I could have had Deuces I think if
I did call Deuces pre flop I would
probably all play always play it this
way so it's not a complete blank and now
we have to think about strategy I'm not
really sure how this spot is going to
look in theory but luckily chances are
that my opponent will also know how the
spot looks like in theory I figured in
game that you know we have threes fours
maybe like ace4 suited 54 suited 56
suited 6 s suited 5 six Sev maybe some 8
n suited however I think this is more
likely to be in his range and I figured
we just have a very good Blocker in
terms of with the Ace in terms of
blocking ace4 and pocket bis which I
think is going to be the primary hands
that he's going to be calling down that
I decided to just ship my stack in
leveraging the advantage that we have in
nutted hands in our range and just
putting a bunch of pressure on his
overpays like kings queens Jacks tens
stuff like that I think it's very hard
for us to be bluffing here if he thinks
about in terms of like some Equity hands
or hands that Mak sense obviously if we
turn the flush draw let's say we had
king queen Hearts it would not really be
the hand that I would ever blo so then I
would need to show up with something
complete bananas like this and it's
probably only suited which are going to
be let's say in this case three combos
if I decided to do the Diamonds the
hearts the clubs actually the hearts I
will give up the river so two combos so
it's very hard for me to be
significantly over bluffing here I F in
game so yeah let me know what you think
of this line comments down below is this
pure Wizardry or do we need to go back
to the lab now villain decided to make
the call pretty fast if I recall he
almost snap calleded me with 78 which I
think makes a lot of sense he's removing
a lot of my value with a seven six seven
suited U pocket sevens the eight You
could argue maybe like some 8 n suited
but like I said I don't really think I
would have that that often in my range
and he's unblocking a lot of the Bluffs
so I think actually his call is probably
standard if you think about from a
preference point of view which hand you
want to call with this definitely seem
better than a hand like pocket kings so
yeah I think he played his hand very
well the question is did I let me know
comments down below next hand we have
posted our blind accidentally I might uh
I might add but luckily we are not the
only one because the recreational player
also posted his blind he decided to
check and I decided to make a small race
from to 30 Euro tin out the field a
little bit and try to get heads up with
the recreational but the big blind calls
in general I think it's quite
interesting I think this is a spot where
I'm just going to be super wide so I
will be three betting super wide as well
if I'm in a big blind and the
recreational now calls as well flop is
Queen Queen six Spin and checks and the
recreational now leads out for 40 I
think all options here are fine and
debatable obviously there's still
someone left to act behind us that we
have to take in consideration I decided
to call I think it's a bit on the loose
side if someone is left to act and
obviously you know we don't have a great
hand obviously if I had King 7 of Spades
I would definitely fault if I had King
Jack I would probably call so King seven
is somewhere in the middle if he beted a
little bit smaller I would always call
etc etc big blind did go out of the way
which was probably our main concern I
just think that this B is full of [ __ ]
and I think just raising straight away
with King seven I think is also a fine
option now he bets 40 again which kind
of feels to me like he has a hand that
was worth 40 bucks on the flly and is
now still worth 40 bucks on the turn so
his hand strength has gotten reduced
hands that come up to me are hands like
pocket deces pocket 3 Pocket fours a six
or something along those lines obviously
he could also just be full of [ __ ] and
just be betting a random King High
random ace high some T Jack something
like that uh I think folding is out of
the question we only have to win 15.7%
of the time so I think calling bluffing
reverse and again re-evaluating if he
shows a lot of strength we can still
fold I decided to now throw out a race
straight away putting like some pressure
on these low pairs I think if he has
pocket threes you know it's uh it's not
easy life uh if he has 10 Jack he might
call and we sometimes win versus that
hand so and again I think he's just
taking like some control over the pot he
has shown weakness and this is kind of
the point where I start to attack that
Fillin calls and river is an eight and
villain now dunks out for half pot now
we ranged him initially on the turn on
something that was worth
€40 right in a 175 pot an eight is
definitely an option I do believe though
that recreationals if they have an eight
they might size a little bit bigger or
they might get tricky you can obviously
still have a queen some of the time this
is all very very very much possible
however I think it's just way more
likely that on the turn he picked up a
hand like 910 and now decides to Bluff
that or on the turn he was sticky with a
hand like 65
and now decides to Bluff that so I
decided to call I guess raising is an
option we could consider but then we
will be trying to Bluff him off an eight
and as we learned earlier in this video
trying to Bluff recreational players off
two pair plus type of holding so far has
not been very successful so I decided to
actually make the call let me know what
you guys think in the comments down
below how did we play this hand pure
Wizardry or should we go back to the lab
Vin now shows up in indeed with a a six
that he turned into a bluff but
unfortunately for us he also had the ace
to go with it and therefore he owned us
pretty hard and probably now laughing
his F off thinking that we are the fish
and I guess we might be the fish let me
know in the comments Down Below guys and
for the last hand of this review we will
be playing a three upot in position big
blind versus small blind with pocket kns
FL comes 5 six s and now my opponent
decides to lead out now we just talked
earlier about leading like these low
boards however I think this is
especially nice when we are the outpos
caller in like EP andp cutof situations
in blind versus blind though the small
blind call will have caller will have
more offsuit hands like ajck offsuit in
his range king queen off suit hands like
King 10 suited which we might not always
have in the other positions and we have
way more hands like King six offsuit
ace5 offsuit Queen Seven off suit so I
think range versus Range wise I think
we're way less incentivized to lead in
this scenario than if we would be
playing the scenario that I played
earlier with the a Jack now some leading
you know might still happen but I think
it's definitely reduced compared to the
other positions I decided to race I
think pocket NS is probably the nuts
here if we think about the overpar I
don't think he have t plus uh because he
would probably always forb bet that then
nines dominates eights in the best way
possible it has backup back of D versus
five sixes and sevens in case we were
beat so I think if I want to raise a
hand it's probably pocket NS ven decides
to call and the turn is a three and now
he decides to lead out again so we have
one dun B on the Flop and we have
another dunk B on the turn shout out to
this guy this guy is paying attention he
now leads very small though is basically
10% and usually at some point when they
go this small I just kind of think okay
what would I do if he checked well
probably pocket NES I think is just good
enough for a bet I think if he had I had
like five sixes or sevens good chances
that he would have come over the top on
the Flop so I think this bat is more
likely or his range is a bit more
weighted towards ace8 suited king9
suited flush draw sure he could have a
four like pocket Force definitely an
option uh maybe he has pocket eights
sometimes I think also definitely an
option but I do think actually that hand
should probably just stack straight away
on the Flop I decided to throw
throughout another race I'm still pretty
happy with my hand uh sizing wise we
could have maybe just ripped our
stacking outr away 800 and 600
definitely think the spr is small enough
there's there's like a lot of bad Rivers
for our hand like any overcard obviously
a heart a four that would not be great
so in hindsight I might have liked to
see myself Jam the turn here but I race
a little bit smaller obviously now we
prize him in with for example a flush
draw so yeah I think I would have liked
to see myself Jam in hindsight but I
didn't a race smaller feeling now Cold
River is a five and talking about some
serious Street poker he decided that you
know the opportunity now arised for him
to dunk bet all three streets he just
went for it now the five I don't think
changes anything in terms of the
equities this is not an equity improving
card for him you could say that he now
made some boats but a set is just worth
so much money already on the turn that I
don't really see him playing a set this
way that often so I thought in game it
was way more likely he had something
like ace8 suited busted flush draw now
obviously we don't beat any value I
guess there is some small chance that he
has like Ace five of Hearts but if he
has Ace five a Hearts you know then then
good for him so I decided to look him up
thinking that if he had a better hand
than me it would have been very likely
that on the Flop it would have gone in
or on the turn it would have gone in and
I don't really see how the five has
helped in so I decided to make the call
let me know what you guys think of this
hand pure Wizardry or do we need to go
back to the lab let me know in the
comments down below villain showed up
with the King 10 Hearts triple dunk bat
