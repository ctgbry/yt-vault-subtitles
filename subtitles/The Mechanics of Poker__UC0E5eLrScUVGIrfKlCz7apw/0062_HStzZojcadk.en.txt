do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a
free one hour demo hello hello hello
hello hello
my dear twitch friends so guys what
we're gonna do today is a little bit
different
as what i have in store for you hey the
title already says it a little bit right
so we got a
new format today because as you guys can
see what is this
well this is uh four tables
of the legends mikey boyfin
linuslove and stefan
battling it out if you guys want to see
a real high sex poker life
the thing is i cannot really plan when
someone is live i prefer to have my
sessions planned so what i did is i went
there recorded it
so we can watch it back in our own time
basically
and the idea is that we will just go
over it
and talk about spots as they come along
this way you can also directly ask me
questions and we can kind of
spar on why do you think this is a good
play
who's the fish in that game start us
with an interesting question
who is the fishing escape
i mean from what i understood shout out
to linus man lioness
from what i heard he didn't play six max
in the last two years
mainly focus on heads up but here you
can clearly see that line is really
understands the game okay because
basically in the end guys poker
is just range versus range interaction
given the board but what changes
compared to heads up in 300 that there's
a different range
right so the interaction on the flop
changes
let's say for example the percentage of
error or the percentage of gutters or
the percentage of pair where the range
advantages disadvantages they change
so you will probably need to get used to
that a little bit again but it does
understand that how range is connected
what kind of impact that will have on a
strategy
because it's not like because it's now
it's not heads up because it's
three-handed
that suddenly it's not poker anymore no
okay
the principles of poker day remain the
same just a game of equities and
we're trying to realize a lot of equity
and try to make sure that our opponents
don't realize
and we try to get a lot of money in with
our good hands so here there's an
open i would say on table two
six ace the board that probably in a lot
of your low sex games you got sea bed
range often definitely something that
you should be punishing
who has the best view kacha or jimmy
obviously gotcha
jimmy jimmy
jimmy i think he's also a player who got
lost a little bit in his own creativity
from time to time i remember i was there
was about the 300 game that uh we
reviewed
me poker glucan explode uh and it was
jimmy ross654 and linus
that was a game guys that was a firework
game
is mma top 10 6 max
in your time what do you mean in your
time when i was playing
it was definitely definitely top 10
so yeah it gets checked around and this
is something that uh
icon boyfriend should definitely be a
bit more careful on this texture
whereas i think a lot of players are not
that careful on that texture
and on table one i think we had an open
race from the small blind
what it looks like reacts a check flop a
check turn and
small bet on the river in general is a
good strategy
and we face a race
good candidate for mike bolton to be
doing this with could be a hand like 10
jack
the first fan that comes in my mind they
like that they're playing 150 big band
deep but he's still three bets to the
same sizing
i see boot 100 i personally increase my
three bet sizing here a little bit
he checks back this three seven eight
boards not a board that he should see
bad
at very high frequency maybe like 50-ish
percent
seven checks again definitely board that
stefan should now be
uh be looking to lead at a decent
frequency
probably a mix of sizings
or maybe say you could get away with
only betting small
that's that's probably also fine but
probably a mix
and he indeed goes for delay half pot
you could still do this with quite a
wide variety of hands for example you
could be checking back a7
and deciding to now bet it on the turn
because there's quite a lot of hence the
value from five
sixes ace jack ace ten high flush was
like king queen of spades or something
and obviously he could have turned a
nine but like i had like ace nine off
for example
actually i don't think that three bets
that's quite interesting to see
what he's gonna show up with
gonna go for the bet my best guess i
don't know let's
let's see what you guys think so he
checks back the flop delays the turn
for half pot and now bets like three
quarters ish on the river
what do you guys think linus has
i think he could still go a little bit
marginal like a7 off i think that's a
very
reasonable candidate
it could have just checked back
wind and suited but the thing in these
positions usually the three bedding
range of the big blind is going to be
a little bit more polarized
and i see queen 10 suited a hand being
called quite often
i would think it's more likely that he
[Music]
shows up with like a jacket deuce of
hearts as a bluff asus would indeed be
nice check back i do think actually that
that asus could probably check back
twice i think that's a valid option
kings could be an option
as i think i would probably prefer to
check back twice but then again there is
two flush draws
king jack off again i think it's a hand
that doesn't get three bad
i think it's more likely that he has a
seven and like
ten dose of hearts or something or
indeed uh
trapped aces or kings actually i haven't
seen his hands as well
so he indeed had like a uh a [ __ ]
type of hand
so where i said the tendu suited he
showed up with the queen six offsuit
which is gonna be a very low frequency
three bet
we see here on table two lioness
choosing to use a big bad strategy
on a standus definitely a spot where you
can use
multiple strategies for example you can
just decide to mimbed only
which i think is an okay strategy you
can decide to use the big bat
check and then when you play big bad
check actually on a stand deuce
probably you only have big bad no small
bets
he's thinking about it decides to follow
it through with a nice little pop bat
again
there's now some connectivity with five
four and
five four definitely a hand that fight
for off for example is definitely a hand
that mike
wolfing could have that linus doesn't
same with h4 off h3 off h5 off
though it's definitely an improving card
for mikey boyfin's range
and he knows that so he decides to throw
out a little razi
very interesting and this is usually in
general a good spot if you're
looking to apply pressure right look at
a spot
where villain or where you have hands in
your range that villain doesn't have
so in this case like i said the 5'4 then
good candidates me to maybe bluffing
with 3 5 35 suited
for example who's 5 suited
how much big blinds you will win lose in
these lineups
i have no clue no clue
definitely losing but how much
better to say okay we get a call from
linus
now the question is is maki boyfriend
going to follow through
with his boss i think a lot of his blogs
have
quote quote some showdown value
like it has a three like i said three
five
chicken song not incoming because he did
uh
he did actually decide to go for the bat
so definitely not a chicken song
and a snip call from a stem and he did
he showed up with the bluff with the
four
six of spades which i think he played
his hands
perfectly fine
so definitely not the chicken song but
more
and also like he has a low flush so
usually people like to give up flushes
or flush us on the river
main reason for this being if you can't
raise a turn
linus will call with a lot of flush
draws that he will now fold the river
but as we already concluded like what
are your other bluffs right
uh and also with the six and the four
it's not like you're blocking a lot of
flash draws
so lioness for example could still have
maybe like a lower type of postural
but actually don't think it lowered like
a king high flusher for example probably
doesn't barrel the turn
so then he would have a deck eight of
spades
which i think would just fold the turn
so actually i think linus
usually has an ace uh
and then the question from mike and
boyfriend is is lion is going to fold an
a's on the river well obviously now we
have two pairs so never folded here we
have a little four bat pot
queen nine three block
and a civil by stefan they're playing uh
effectively they were starting 170 big
lines deep
we face a little czech membranes which
is the preferred pto world sizing
which is a bigger scam genji getting
your best book i mean come on best poker
coaching
shout out to best poker coaching guys
what do you think what do you think best
poker actually thinks of what's going on
i i have to play this clip probably
he checks he either has something or not
i would just jam and if he has a 10
he'll call if not he'll fault it's as
easy as that
i would just jam here i think he is this
you're
damn [ __ ] god damn it
why do you do this [ __ ] all the time all
the
[ __ ] time i teach you don't do those
gay bets
why do you have to do it why
and he definitely doesn't agree with the
small bets
but okay okay we got a call so there's
action
actually i don't have any clips from jin
if anyone could give me a good uh clip
suggestion from ginz
much appreciated followed up with a
small bed here now by mikey
it's in general a decent turn
in terms of king 10 suited definitely in
mikey boyfriends range and probably not
in stefan's
kingdom off stefan is definitely not for
betting would be way too spewy
queen jack suited definitely a hand that
michael boffinger i guess could have
nines a hand that michael boffin could
have
obviously stephan still having the
advantage in sets
especially now with jax that one could
have hands but probably not
always this deep
and for mikey boyfriend to have here as
a bluff ace 10 suited i mean
i think that's a fine candidate i get a
call
queen pairing on the river
rebecca what are the best hands to check
with to be honest
uh they're quite deep now i don't
understand sure
on that on the big man's deep you do see
that if you connect you're just gonna do
quite a lot of check raising
quite mergy as well uh you'd be
surprised what kind of hands would want
to check raise in this spot
you would for example probably with
frequencies check raise hands like
pocket sevens
because the silver is [ __ ] crazy in
the head
actually i do know why that happens but
obviously guys we cannot we cannot
review everything huh
this is just a a warm maker
in dutch so let's see i mean the queen i
guess
is better for stefan stefan could
definitely have more better king queen
off
which i could both probably doesn't have
ace queen off in these positions i know
100 bb deep especially
that's true but some of the time i would
say deeper
as well mainly to deny equity
realization from let's say
and like 10 8 suited 10 seven suited
that mike and boyfriend would probably
the the the three bedding range of the
big blinds is a little bit more
concentrated in the middle and a little
bit more suited so or wearing hand like
ace queen off makes some sense
i would say from mike and boyfin
i mean kings and aces are obviously the
majority of stefan's range i would say
so it wouldn't really make sense to
check and like nines
so i would say you have a strong hand
you shouldn't be checking
and basically i don't think maki
boyfriend ever has a check already on
the river and i
also don't think you need one if he
checks he gives up
he jumps okay shout out yeah like i said
the the only bluff i would say that
makes a lot of sense
is in the diamonds bucking some queen 10
suited if he did decide to forbid
blocking some ace queen off
uh 9 10 suited nintendo diamonds for
example
is an option ace tree of hearts
could be an option but i would
again guys if you see this happening in
your limit i would definitely over fault
like
it's very hard to show up with bluffs
right
i do see quite a lot of value freeze
queen jack excluded intense student
actually general right four by pots is
very little combos
that one did decide to end up folding
okay yeah we don't really know what he
has so
is he a chicken i don't know i don't
know if he's a chicken
here we have the small bet i'm still
going for my initial read with pocket
knights
the turn is an eighth a good card from
mikey boyfin and
as we could see on the board 456 this
was going to happen quite often
therefore we check quite often on the
flop i'm from brazil
seven jamming eight four five yeah
exactly ace four i think ace four is a
very likely hand
i mean mikey boyfriend's most likely
range is a jack
and he will probably have to call some
of the jacks
like the lower ones we see small bed
small bed and another small bed
i like this bed a lot too this is really
really kind of sexy
really sexy oh we have pocket knights
[ __ ] it i sorry them
swear to god i have not seen this hand
but as mentioned i think if there's one
hand that you might want to bat his
pocket knife and he just showed up with
the pocket knights
and here check check flop that three
quarters phase race
interesting uh this is definitely a spot
where stefan
i think this sizing
i decided i think does make some sense
it's not like the ace is on the flop and
the king is on the turn
i think this sizing makes sense like he
raises
yeah makes up also makes sense we don't
really know what his hand is
lioness actually stabs the flopper on
the ace king 10 and gets a call
a lot of action we actually get a call
here
so stefan
showing that he has something and i
expect an overvet here from mike
boyfin he goes for pot actually in a
couple of spots where i would like to
over bet he decides to go for pot
but i think here pot does make sense
as i think he's still betting him like
ace jack
and stefon is still a little bit more
unkept but still fives and eights
be very reasonable so no reason to
go too big if you're mikey
now you know maybe give the guy give the
guy an option to bluff you now with five
exit clubs or something
stable in the tank in the first table
and he goes for the race
just as we said maybe give the guy some
room so
this is the reason why i think michael
boffin did doesn't go for the pot he
checked backflop
and fives and eights are no longer mikey
bulman's range whereas fives and eights
are definitely in the range of stefan
so therefore what i first thought like
okay that over bet i think here pot is
way better so i would have definitely
made a mistake here
and maybe overplayed my ace jack or ace
queen or maybe when you have ace jack
race queen
you kind of when you press over badge
you're like maybe a little bit too much
so you kind of scroll down towards spot
a poker ambition who is the best tuner
now zoom player and why is it
don't hate me 89 actually yeah we were
real actually real
don't ate me hate me 89 for a little bit
never saw her before but i had to
read at the end and then i saw her and
so hey really cool to see
a female poker player for once and
that's the same and she was really good
so shout out to her go give her a follow
don't hate me 89.
she's not in the hot tub guys maybe we
should make the bet with her
probably would make everyone way happier
than seeing me in a hot tub
but i guess this is also a bad
preconception right that you think a
female player
can be good so maybe that's not very
good of me
but i was pleasantly surprised he played
very well
so we get the race and like i said yeah
in terms of bluffer stay from
uh five eggs of clubs
eight exit clubs but i don't think eight
of clubs steps to turn so you would have
five exit clubs
see there's also some straights complete
so you could have four seven
of clubs you could have seven nine of
clubs
mikey in the tank yeah mikey probably
has
his jack kind of the lemma if you have
ace five
ace eight i think is definitely calling
is ac8 basically we can
we can chop the pod versus a8 as well
but yeah if you have ace five here
you're blocking fives but especially if
you have a club you're also blocking his
gloves
but yeah if you have ace jacket's queen
here ace queen doesn't think it's not
like they just see that's the flop so i
think ace 10 is jack
is jack i guess is the most likely
holding that he's not tanking with
and he calls it this jack and step over
the a6
sad that is a nasty [ __ ] river
how sick is that how sick is that
and this makes a lot of sense to bet
three quarters on the turn
then his race also makes a lot of sense
and his river check race also makes a
lot of sense
even though he was timing with i think
one of the few hands that he's going to
raise turn and
bet the river with that's not ace five
and ace eight
actually wait you beat ace five yeah if
he has ace eight
gg oh my god
admit it say it say it you have to say
it these guys seem to agree
with negranu that they like to make all
these sexy bets
and i use these clips quite often as
well because i also like to make all
these sexy beds if you also want to know
why you should make sexy bets i have a
whole [ __ ] chapter about sexy bats
actually it's not called sex
but in the mechanics of poke and
actually is also something that i
discussed quite briefly
quite deeply in the master class three
will pass out of position
now we face an overbend on the turn so
he kind of delayed his over bat
which is interesting i personally
don't size much bigger than three
quarters in a spot like this
but the board is quite dry
so i don't mind the thing is you are way
more likely
to always see that trees fives nines
whereas linus is a little bit more
unkept i would say
in terms of threes and five so therefore
you usually or i usually don't go too
big
but this is a spot that
you're gonna be checking back while i
love ace jack king jack i don't mind it
here
also you can definitely get a lot of
calls by anzac king queen five exit
clubs in general 5x i would say oh a
completing card with a diamond and a 3.
do you think eating a 3 is a little bit
optimistic if your line is
kind of depends on which 3 i guess
lines could definitely still have some
higher flushes where i don't think
staphon will have a lot of high flushes
let's see that spot
again uh just like we saw mike and
boyfriend do
with a stack he does recognize
that he has the advantage in terms of
ace jack
king jack but that advantage is not
worth more than pot
given the fact that there's a flush the
board is parrot and that linus can still
have five
how do you approach spot where
imposition can see that range
how do you approach the spot where in
position can see that range
that's check back etc three five nine
you can see that range for seventy
percent
i uh i am you know uh so dumb
that's why you played this one you
understand what you're saying
[Music]
what you're saying
so could you maybe further how you
approach
i don't really get it but is it life
you know we will get a fast interaction
so i would say stefan most likely hand
uh asia king jack
and terms of loss
king 10. with
diamond
back to the grind let's start the month
of june with some high-stakes sketch
