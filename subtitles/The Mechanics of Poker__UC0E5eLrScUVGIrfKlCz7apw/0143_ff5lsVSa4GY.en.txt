um
jam is probably a good option but i'm
gonna go for a small bath and
again
give
give the recreation an option i think
giving the recreational an option is
usually a good idea because
in general what they do with options is
significantly worse than
what a regular what a solver would do
with options
[Music]
hi there boys and girls welcome to this
very first live play and explain of 2022
we're going back to the roots got a
little bit tired of streaming but i
still wanted to provide you guys with
some high level playing content as well
so let's see
how we will do
pooh is looking
[Music]
quite
reggish with two guys that i don't know
deadline off i'm gonna three bet some of
the time not this time
faces c-bet
i think it's quite close
i think i'm going to call with a heart
i would have folded eight nine
and i think on the turn i'm just gonna
make a small bet
and i think we can go quite small here
if he has a hand that is nothing like
eight nine offsuit for example i think
you know
it's probably a
good spot and i think on the river
we don't have the best hand for an
overbet i would say
but i do think the board run out quite
good for an over bat so that's what
we'll do
i think he still has some hands that are
just always going to fault like king
queen with a heart for example or some
ace heights with a heart
but i think when the three rolls off
uh we can have pocket threes we can have
five six we can have is five
[ __ ] my pot boy [ __ ] my pot get
the [ __ ] out of my pot thank you very
much
so
based on the river i decided to use a
big sizing
i think normally 910 probably wants to
use a smaller sizing
because
in general
you want to pick a sizing for which you
block some of the hands that it is going
to call you with
so this way
your bluff basically becomes more
efficient
and if i over bet obviously he's going
to fold a hand like jack 10 and jack 9
for example so theoretically speaking i
think there we should uh we should
probably use a smaller sizing
but hey
if you feel like you know if you feel
like your part is going to default
yeah just uh
just press the over bet button and hope
you fought
okay
we're back to
we're back to wisdom here on the wacko
show king 8 is very good word for me i'm
just going to basically
that's very small and punish him the
queen 10 10 is actually a very bad board
for me
to have a backdoor flush draw and he
bets 20
so i think i'm still going to call
but
these these are boards that
think you're going to have to fold
wide all right if you look at his four
bet range basically
the worst hand that he has in his four
bed range maybe he is not suited or
something
here i get a raise with king eighties go
i'm gonna check the turn
he bets again
this is really a shitty spot
do you think we have to call
but again i'm not very happy about it he
could be merging me on the terminal like
ace king even though i actually don't
think that really has much emerging
effects i don't think i would ever fold
a better hand here with the king eight
he raises flop checks back
i'm going to check the river
and with ajak i'm going to
fold you know
i was getting quite a good price on the
turn almost directly drawing
assuming that you know
my outs
i think i think my turn is probably just
to fall because my outs aren't even
clean and here making it easy call and
he had king seven
which i don't think is a race on the
flop so actually i think my hand is
probably a fault on the turn because
let's have proof to a king because the
board is parrot obviously he then makes
king's fool and
i'm a sucker with my straight
king five
against sometimes or bad but not going
to it's king easy get it in
so yeah i'm honestly not sure i i do
think in general
when the four bet range
of your opponent connects that well like
on queen 10 10
uh
you should usually be careful so i think
from that perspective we should not have
called turn i think floppers in with the
back of flash draw i wouldn't be
surprised if without the background
flashers just to fold on the flop
i'm going to overcoat with the queen
then off with the recreational
recreationals
and actually i think i'm going to donkey
donkey dunk this flop and i think
actually one big blind will do so that's
what we're going for
with one caller
got two callers
yeah three callers no respect guys no
respect and i think on the turn i'm
going to split
my range and i think queen then still
wants to bet
two and a half big blind should do
at the fault we get a call
we'll get another call
river
i think it's actually very likely that
we still have the best hand so i'm gonna
go for a small bed again
probably uh will still get called by
worse than maybe this guy sometimes does
something funky
saying that he has the 10 8 the 10 8 but
i have the 10 my friend
he raises
and
he can have my money if he has it
he he was slow playing me all the way
he was slow playing me all the way
it was either that or
or he rivered something a rivering
something i think there is going to be
quite unlikely
i think there's recreationals there it's
just a
this can go either way i'm gonna start
with the check
the jacks here
i can actually also go either i'm gonna
start with an overpass versus
recreational the jack 9 easy call on the
turn this is not really a sizing he
should be using that often
usually then when that happens it's
quite transparent so he probably has a
weak jack
[Music]
to be a bit thin
here are the jacks
what is a good size in tibet
oh but under 25 again
but i like the way i played the queen 10
i think
i think i played that handball
king jack three four eight
raised from the cut-off so i'm to have
and like jack 10 off in my range
and it's not really important i'm going
to see that
as a crazy person if i had a club in my
hand i think this hand would make it in
my betting range
maybe this hand already makes it in my
betting range i'm not 100 sure
then on the turn
i definitely do think it makes it in my
betting range
we're gonna have to turn some some set
some of the time we can event like a
seven
eight nine eight ten
that we check back to flop with because
it's two tone
there's a threes in the fours which i
guess four's always open but threes
not necessarily
king queen
quite a good board for me
like to start off with a small bet here
i see some royal flush potential so
let's just go for that
any faults dude it was ten percent so
cheap
must be dutch
no it's not dutch
we do suited versus limp don't call
[Music]
don't actually bet the flop
we put the ace king
we have quite some
uh card to improve upon the king a ten
the three a five
he raises
and i was gonna say versus calling range
uh i think we
she'll do quite well
we can make him fall down like queen
nine straight away which is
a little bit beneficial obviously the
only downside is that he could not
sometimes race
now we're gonna get sucked in
as
we basically have direct odds
to call
or at least almost
we still sometimes win
i guess jack
that's unfortunate
he did gave us the correct price
cloven just like here
he's giving us a good price to draw some
let's try that drawing
we'll make a note on him though
afraid of flushes or gets to failure
it's a good note to have on on
recreationals is i would say it's a
general note on recreationals but it's
again good
to see it confirmed
recreationals often easily over bluff in
these kind of spots
not necessarily because they're so bluff
happy but because they forget the very
bed and if your value betting range
suddenly exists off
yeah very little cards then you need
just a couple of plots and you're
basically already over bluffing
it's five easy check
um
i don't think i'm going to check raise
this
we've had about back the flush draw or
something to go with my hand
this half bot
uh i think i'm actually just going to
fall straight away
the six is uh lousy out and even if i
hit my six and it's good then we have to
dodge a ten and a nine on the river
so
yeah
not too happy about it jack 8 faces
check back going to check again
it might have been to play
correctly
okay and i have to be careful what i say
he bets quite big
i think i can just get away with folding
jack eight
as i had like ten nine for example
it's a purple as an open ender there's
two flushers so i have purpose draws
i have overs to the uh
to the king
some ace heights with a draw but i think
jack 8 just
wants a check fold
but what i was saying first to check
back
people play different strategies in
check back i think it's one of the lines
where
people play least common
so
having a good idea
if if it's a villain that you play
against regularly to take a look at his
game to see how he constructs his
checkpack range and what that means
i think
can give you some
good information
is eight is close
i had a club or something with my hand
or at least uh
a flash card i would have probably bet
ace 9 would probably bet
now it goes check check check i think we
just have a bet
diamond should not really have improved
him
a club would have been worse
see we could have probably bet bigger
i think when the flush completes this is
of my size
i think if it reverses the blank i'm
going to split between
small and big
i think not just bending three quarters
is fine
tense facing the three bet from the
small blind i think we have a call
it's quite a good board for me i don't
think seven's an eight versus mp is
always going to three bet
okay so it does check
i'm going to bet this one's the time
rolled quite high so i'm going to start
off with the bet
you can call me with with pocket knights
can get some protection versus some over
cards
we check raises obviously i'm not very
happy but i think we call one
here with ace eight
and go for a check
it's a good turn
checks
i don't mind actually a small bet here
here i don't think he really checks much
stronger hands on the river
actually going to play a bit here with
the s8
like actually this was the same player
as before
he calls
and i think we check the river
and hit top set
yeah actually i don't think the term bet
is that great in these positions
in hindsight
she have a limp here he does this some
of the time
thinking nine
against his strategy i'm not really sure
what to do i think it's a bit too weak
this is his strategy to
[Music]
to iso
i feel like it's a bit too strong to
fault so yeah
then what's left is the limp
kings check back twice
and i think i'm going to bet the river
and k9 is false
he snaps that's not good news
i think he should just bet that
i think it's a
over check
because i'm gonna river like some king
queen i'm gonna have some king jack
so basically
and i mean i would have called with
kings anyway so he didn't really gain
much value in my opinion but i do think
he loses value
pocket kings
or a bet
so two term board so i'm not
gonna use a little bit more bigger bats
i'm gonna bet a little bit less in
general
squeezier with the ace queen
kind of a hard to go with my hand
i think i'm going to check
uh his is bluffs
okay that's a very bad river
um
like his bluffs on the the hands that
have air on the turn and we are gonna
have hands that have very little equity
versus my hand like king jack king 10
jack 10
so
i don't mind checking
and keeping those hands in basically
jack then draws to
four clean outs
and two very bad outs for him so there's
a scenario where jack then where
sometimes
i refer
a boat and he rips a straight
and i think just checking
and keeping my evi even on the heart
and if the reverse are blank just raise
i think there is mine
jacks checks checks
this is close
in terms of what i want to do versus
recreational
it's not really a gto
sizing that i just used
i think there's a recreation that's fine
so on the flop sizing-wise both
both smaller bets and bigger bets have
benefits bigger the benefits of bigger
bets if you're getting more money in
versus the range that calls now like ant
like pocket sevens
let's say for example two scare cards
would have rolled off then at least we
had a big bet on the flop downside of
big betting is that
he will do less funky [ __ ]
and
recreationals you know that's sometimes
a funky [ __ ]
and
i like
to usually play a strategy versus
recreational where
funky [ __ ] can happen
so
obviously
for example it's quite standard to
to size down there with for example
and like aces or kings
jack's a little bit less so in theory
but i think there's a recreational still
fine
king high
thinking high
it's close
i'm gonna peel
would have preferred to not have an 8
like king 5 or something because then he
basically has more air but i had like 8
10 off suits for example
i think that's okay
um
i think now
a graphic finance over bet having a king
okay i'm going to start off with a bet
i'm going to do various various
strategies on a board like 105.3 i'm
going to bet small sometimes i'm going
to bet
quote quote big sometimes i'm going to
check a lot i'm going to check crazy i'm
going to check call it's it's really a
port where
basically just play your hand
but in general i would recommend just
you know doing what your hand wants to
do
and then going from there but especially
on a board like that i think that's
that's just very important
do you want to make 2022
your greatest poker year ever
now i've done a webinar on how to do
that in our academy which we have made
available completely for free so go over
to pokerambition.com
and let me help you achieve your goals
not going to check raise sixes i think
if you start check raising middle pairs
it's always one with a set blocker so
five six seven six i think those are
okay-ish hands
here with the seven and i'm going to
start with over bet
the queen 9
and i think the river is just a check i
don't think our hand is strong enough
to
do anything else
let's start with that
the f5 does improve its range sort of
but i think about this
probably still a good sizing
we think he has some some autofilter on
the turn mainly jack then
we block a straight
correction we have a straight
we should not have 910
and i can have all the nine tens
so
definite spot where we're gonna do a lot
of jamming
because i don't think 910 wants to play
passive two streets
or at least passive just calling i don't
think
nighttime really wants to do
so should be good here
and i think jam is probably the only
sizing
we can have jack tents
so
it's not a spot where i think with
jamming we lack bluffs
i'm gonna call it bucket force
recreation small blind
eight nine
gonna be close for me hold this time
he checks
we have good force
as in
we blocked like some ace for suited for
what it's worth just gonna start it with
a bat but not not too happy about it
basically just hoping that he folds some
air
or maybe that he sometimes calls with
king high and checks it down
i think it's a spot where
you want to bet your lowest pairs first
let's set eight i would always check but
i think force is a
it's a fine check
and now on the river i strongly hope
that he checks but if he bats yeah
we're kind of in a
initiative spot and i don't think
there's much else we can do and then
just fold
give that spot
yeah i don't think there's much we can
do here actually i'm gonna go for the
over limp here again with the 4-8 really
funky this one but hey it's it's sort of
a suited connector in my brain with two
recreationals behind and him allowing us
the chance to get into the pot
i think this is kind of the way
should exploit him
um
i'm gonna three bet this hand
i'm tempted to peel but i'm gonna fold
here i went for the three bet i don't
think i'm gonna do much calling versus a
5x open
if this guy is still behind
so then i thinking queen of uh
it becomes three but the eight four was
yeah it was close we we could have
called we could have raised we could
have folded
you flop if you flip a coin with three
sides and just pick one it's probably
fine
this is a very shitty hand
i'm going to call because you have
possible recreation i'm not really sure
this guy is in a recreation on the big
blind
and i think this is a point i'm gonna
pick on
don't try this at home ladies and
gentlemen
then i was referring to the calling
with aids to suit it
do you know if i see if you see a hand
that is suited flop a straight flop
flush
gotta be in it gotta be in it
pocket sevens versus recreational gonna
start off with a one third but
part of my uh
let the guy do something funky strategy
he snapchat the river i think we just
have the best hand if he snapchats i
think with a nine he would have
considered it so i think he just has a
lower hand than mine like a three like a
four
pocket five spoke at sixes
we squeeze out some value
there's a 3x 910 off suit
not really sure
it's a recreational versus
it's a regular i think it's just a fault
i'm very tempted to make a little check
race
let's not let that spot get escalated if
i was already not even sure if i should
have defended
there was some wisdom right there
bring down easy call
you check now on the turn
and depending on sizing is you call on
the river
here
actually i'm going to call
this guy with queen 10 yet the nuts
calling here has some benefits and some
downsides
i think i think three better would have
been better
obviously you know
my mentality is usually i want to play
pots with the fish but we had this
limping guy overlimping
so we now let him in the pot as well
and
assuming that he also paced
sort of decent you know we let the guy
in
we probably don't really want
that um
i'm just gonna check again with this
exact combo blocking the ace king
blocking the bucking the king queens
and again part of my strategy is
try to get the recreation in a spot
where you can do something funky
like it doesn't like it doesn't like it
did now
or at least we don't know if this is
something funky
okay so now we have a call
actually tempted to call
i think he's still going to value bet
here with a fish my line is really weak
so if he has a king he's most likely
just value betting now versus the
recreational
so i don't lose value or at least that
was my thought process now let's see
oh wow
i was completely wrong how the [ __ ] do
you check that behind with a recreation
in the pot
he had king nine two pair
the wreck i was talking about and the
ice out king nine offsuit
okay
both players had two pair and we didn't
get the money in i'm gonna take
responsibility here and say that we
probably played our hand wrong
i'm gonna call her with the seven eight
suited
i can't call country but
i would just mix it up but the wreck
cannot check behind king nine
versus when there's a recreation in the
pot in my in my in my professional
opinion
and he did it really fast as well so
apparently we think different
i mean how many better hands do i have
eight with a heart i guess on the river
that's about it
can we face a jam
yeah there's a spot where i'm very
capped and he's still very uncapped
so it's a spot that it's quite good to
do jamming
obviously you can have the nut flush
you can have
boats you can have
straight but a straight i don't think he
will ever race
but that's at least already eliminated
don't if he always jams the nut flush so
he's basically i think he's going more
towards
boats
may bloss i think would be ace king
with a heart
maybe a queen
we don't block any plus but we also
don't block any value
i think i'm just going to fold
and with the ace deuce i made the small
bat and i'm gonna just check down and
hope to win
the reason i fall it is
he could still just call my race with a
queen or with the hands that i just
mentioned the ace king with a heart
it's not like that those hands are just
oh i only have one option and that's all
in
but hey it's uh i mean it's a tough spot
we're gonna be super capped there
gonna call a true bed here at pocket
knights
and
pops quite close
i think for his cutoff i'm gonna call
but
not very happy about it
it was king jack five i would have
folded but yeah it's close
i'm going to
make a little race here the five seven
and now i'm a bit [ __ ]
checks
okay that's a bit of a weird check
i decided to bet because i think he
could have checked behind i had like ace
jack ace 10. he was also thinking about
it on the turn
i think that could make sense obviously
he can also have king jack
obviously the benefit of checking is
that we can let's add jack queen i would
definitely check there
because obviously then we're blocking a
lot of the hero calls
yeah so he did had ace 10
that made a lot of sense he was thinking
about what to do on the turn he wanted
to turn this into a bluff
and i think if he had like complete
nothing like six seven suited he would
have checked the turn faster so based on
the fact that he checked
he
he's basically tank checked
based on that fact i think betting
ourselves is probably better and i don't
think we can bet very big because which
[ __ ] bluff are we supposed to have i
guess we can have five four five six i
should have probably bet slightly bigger
20 would have probably been better
i'm gonna check back and
snap out some bluffs
that's one street
and that's two streets
it got it got him
started with a big bet here with the
jack three
like the flush draw
three
i mean the goddess every turn aren't
that great
but it's a still finance to start
betting
and again it's a board just like a board
i think we had earlier blind versus
blind
like these 2 to 10 height disconnected
boards you can
there's many things you can do basically
turn the gutter could consider
don't mind in a bet here
i think it's a fine play
because we have some showdown value on
the river i think i had like ace 3
or a king high flush draw might call the
turn and check behind on the river
so
i think it's actually an okay spot to go
for a bed
okay jack 10
hmm
quite close
pretty close
and go to color on the river with king
checks
delay
is it going to check reason 8 i think so
if he doesn't check raising eight i
think i would prefer overbetting but i
think it's gonna check resin ace eight
on the river
his call again with queen jack
i think i might even raise the river
it's a bit dicey
checks we want to buff this
we want to bluff against these
and like against the same hand
i think if if he would have bet him
would have probably raised him
i think he's still bluffing a ton but i
don't really want to call and get bluff
by his high
so
i think a race there would have been
good
markup bgd no clue who that is
i think we've got to go
this is a very good river for me
as in if he had underpair now i know win
obviously also part of the reason why i
call because we have
some extra outs
did we need them no we didn't we had him
completely crushed he had king jack
[Music]
who's four i'm going to check behind the
spade version
so don't really want to get check raised
and if they got a turn we have an easy
bet
and use a bigger sizing but not too big
because
we could still have like some hands that
i don't have
on the river
you think we have to bluff this we don't
have it we have no diamonds we block ace
four ace deuce which to be his worst
asex that he decides to play this way
we just suited
because it's pretty
and i don't really mind
check raising descent
okay that's big
might check race
no i don't think it's fine
sizing wise actually i think we still
went a bit on the bigger side
it's a very good term for me
i'm going to pick
interesting river
who is he asking for
now it's literally i i think i'm just
gonna stop this is actually this is
actually [ __ ] unreal i think i'm just
gonna stop guys i don't think have you
ever seen anything like this in your
[ __ ] life what are you on about
are you kidding me this is disgusting
are you seeing this how do people win
what do you want me to do what do you
want me to do what the [ __ ] is going on
oh my god i'm done guys we're back in
the room
we're back in the room
not a great turn
i think the best thing to do now is
check
since the board is quite
wet
like i would much rather block this hand
if it was a rainbow board
gonna go for a check
and hope he doesn't have
king axe
spades or something that is not checking
behind king queen of spades king queen
of clubs i guess those would be the
hands that i lose most value against
and now i think i'm just raising all in
so yeah down the river you're going to
lose value against like i said a jack
but a jack is less likely because i have
a jack
and mainly the king high flusters that
check behind on the turn so there's a
couple combos but i do think he's now
gonna bluff maybe hand like pocket sixes
and obviously the main value that you're
now gaining is if if i would bet three
quarters he would just snap call me with
i don't know ace eight of clubs or
something
whereas now if i check he bets they say
the clubs and now i can raise a win so
that's basically where the value has to
come from now with king jack
plus the fact that i blocked the jack
so that reduces the amount of combos
that could hero call
but check behind if i check
pocket he says i was going to say the
chances of you getting a walk are
usually quite big when your vases
the chances of you getting a raise and a
three-bit in front of you are actually
quite small so
hashtag blessed
for that to happen
also people are way more likely to fold
you have two aces in your hand
unfortunately that's just how it works
when you have two aces
i'd love it to be different
it's going to be very hard for me to be
bluffing
here don't actually see any hands
that
have a bluff
and i think for this sizing
he will still have to raise his 10x and
now i can
unleash
the true strength of my hand
i also don't really think there is much
value in checking
i mean a hand that i guess could bluff
the river with if you check
like an ace high or something that
didn't barrel
because he's gonna have rivert
some king jacks some ace jacks
i think bin bad there is a good sizing
it's
bad it's probably the best flop you can
hope for
um
jam is probably a good option but i'm
gonna go for a small bat
and again
give
give the recreational an option i think
giving the recreational an option is
usually a good idea because
in general what they do with options is
significantly worse than what a regular
or what a solver would do with options
and that's why they are recreational
right
so if we just jam there basically we
i don't think we really allow him to
make much mistakes
that's what i'm trying to say
unless you think he just calls king jack
off then obviously
by jamming we definitely make him
make mistakes
termite kings is a bit close
aces i would definitely check but i
think with kings i'm just gonna borrow
yeah he's gonna fold a lot
especially when i also have a club in my
hand
but i think checking would be a bit too
too fancy
it's the dilemma of
checking loser's value versus his paris
his flush draws his ace queen
where checking gains value versus his
queen jack case then king queen
random hands that will fold
so then for example in that spot i had a
club
then if you have a club that kind of
reduces the downsides
okay start spotting i have an open ender
so far this guy is looking to be quite
aggressive so i'm going to go
interesting turn
check
keep in the random factor
offbot
really not happy here but i'm going to
call once more
that's not the bear the board that we
wanted to see
he mugs
that's good news
yeah pocket deuces okay okay aggressive
placer
bucket deuces let's start a little tree
bed skier with the jack four
why not
this one can go either way i'll do 50
50.
i think king jack
is going to be checking
but ace king king 10 i would definitely
bet but i think king jack
specifically probably wants to check
face is squeezing with the five six i
think i'm going to call the squeeze okay
he calls and i'm definitely going to
call the squeeze
but i would have caught the squeeze
regardless
bad river
for those reasons
come on don't do anything stupid
just call
e-flop
or timeout
it's the other option
it goes
hey guys we have potential
i am tempted to stroll a little betsky
but
we
i don't think
really minds we really might if we get
raised to be honest
it's not like we have such a great hand
that's what you got a good turn
unless he has aces obviously don't jinx
it wacko don't jinx it
don't jinx it
no ajax suited
give it to me baby
give me [ __ ] what the [ __ ]
two hundred percent that's a lot
obviously calling with trips is a very
bad river actually going to lead small i
think
i wasn't really sure in terms of sizing
if i wanted to go
20 or 10
i went 10 and he called me with
king queen
so definitely a hand that he would have
checked behind
