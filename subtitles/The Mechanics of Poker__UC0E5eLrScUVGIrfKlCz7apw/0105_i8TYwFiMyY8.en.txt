depends on the river though depends on
which river you got a river you're going
to river a queen we're definitely
calling of course
bluffed off the ace 9
it's a very unfortunate river for him

[Music]
welcome back to another episode of
little uh little table here
go for a little bit
get a call
what they call an excellent turn
actually in the
in the previous episode of the wacko
show i now check back a similar type of
hand as that i have now
actually goes for elite interesting
i now understand actually the spot a
little bit better than last time
i went into the lab
i figured it out for myself a little bit
more
in terms of not necessarily that you
then
know what to do but it's always
important that
you know if you're confused in some
spots or have certain thoughts that you
at least make up your mind like okay
this is how i'm going to play the spot
whether that is
correct or incorrect distributivity is
ten easy call
flop i see a royal flush drum
good luck have fun thank you we'll
we will probably have fun and we will
probably need luck given the lineups of
today
obviously not gonna fall the back the
royal flush draw
okay i am lucky
i am skillful okay at least
a flush draw not the royal but
you know
ain't bad i'm bad in bed
these barrels
i would actually not have mind betting
this hand if he would have checked but
obviously now we have an easy call again
ink on the river if he checks we're
going to bed
we could have rivered the jack
i don't think we have much bluffs on the
river it would mainly be this hand
don't think i'm gonna bluff ace queen
a screen is just good enough
to check
that then we have ace 10
ace five
and that's probably it
but if he finds a hero go i don't think
it's a great era car i think it's a spot
that definitely can get under bluffed
unless he thinks i'm peeling
sevens or something on the turn without
a spade
and now turning that into a bluff
okay he calls his jack i think it's a
bad call
okay unfortunate for us
[Music]
hey stan here
gonna play tricky
i'm probably gonna play it tricky all
the way actually
i hope he decides to try the fluffy
bluffy
hey pokebitch hello how can i get the
free webinar that i won
oh you should
be
getting
hey
if well if you gave me your email
then you should have got a coupon
you can basically just pick a webinar
and then uh
use that coupon in that webinar and then
you can get a webinar for free that's
kind of how it works
did you send me over your email
uh
i got all in here i'm gonna call against
the recreational
three better than twice in a row he was
like not having it guys not having it
a little color with 89 suited
good flop
the bats which i expect him to do quite
often
is it gone
great turn
obviously
checks now river is quite interesting i
think i'm gonna check again
queen jack
that's a hand i could have got got on
some value from
a trivet here with the pocket queens
okay flop
obviously would have preferred not to
see a king but it's not the end of the
world especially when you have queens
you're blocking quite a lot it's king x
if i'm gonna barrel the turn depends
on a deuce yes on the three yes and a
seven no
but i'll definitely go to check over
ah [ __ ]
i'm very happy about it but
i think one is definitely appropriate
depends on the river though depends on
which river you got a river you're gonna
river a queen
we're definitely calling of course
bluffed off the a's nine
it's a very unfortunate river for him
called forballet let me see andrew i
don't know who this guy is actually
it's going quite big as well
i don't think i would flat too much here
oh
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
oh yeah that's how we like it that's how
we like it that's how we like it that's
how we like it
that's not a good scenario for you my
friend oh my god seriously
ah are you joking
i mean come on
father god damn son of a [ __ ]
[ __ ] bastard son of a [ __ ] [ __ ]
why the [ __ ] [ __ ] sucking hell does
this happen every [ __ ] time
but at least i mean at least the last
one is in chop let's look at it from the
bright side
at least we chopped in the last one
but man man man man you have to be
joking i mean
and trying not to be negative but god
damn [ __ ] [ __ ] do you need some help
playing three bad putts out of position
well for that we have created our master
classes in which we dedicate one
coaching program to dive very deep into
a specific spot go over to the site
pokermission.com masterclasses and
eliminate those weaknesses we have quite
some
equity
as they say
i think you know we can just put a lot
of hands like
king 10 i wanted to say in the tough
spot
and i think on this river
i'm obviously firing gonna be very hard
for us to show up with bloss here
he had a little flush man that's quite
unfortunate
so we make the nut straight and he has a
flush
okay
can i even play in this game i mean what
the [ __ ] they find oh i mean what
i mean how can i even play in this game
it's like i just get cheated i mean hand
after hand after hand a little four bet
with the aces
should just get more premiums guys
life is so much easier with [ __ ]
premiums
a 799 flop
is very good for me i would say
as i can definitely have some 9x in my
forwarding range and i think he doesn't
really have much 9x in his calling range
i don't think i need to have
that much checkbox here
goes for check race
which is a good play
i think i'm just going to ship this am i
but i'd call them
very bad term
as it could have made eight
could have made him 10 jack but
obviously we're not going anywhere
he's pocket jacks
that's a cooler for him
ah thank you very much sir
thank you very much give it to me baby
give me [ __ ] what the [ __ ]
this is our time guys
this is our time
oh the trivia king jack students
it's not a great turn
when you have king jack suited
if he has a better hand then he has a
better hand
a really wacko what a great
a great explanation you gave there thank
you
[Music]
well that's not a great river now isn't
it
no it isn't mr wacko well said
oh [ __ ] i think i pressed the wrong
button
no
well
let's see maybe we dodged one
get squeezed with the ajax suited we're
gonna see a flop
that is a bad flop
as i will never have three sixes or
fives
okay checks well i'm gonna take my free
card not do anything funky
ah that's a good turn
probably should bet this turn
a deuce or seven basically makes us a
straight
then i think we're gonna chop quite
often
i don't think we have to bet very big
just gonna bet one third i think
i think that should do the job
making full days king
uh
yeah
okay
being a bearer is going to be quite
effective for
it's a challa ball from the netherlands
but he checks
uh
oh we check races
uh
i think i'm gonna check races
you would not really see you could see
that ace jack i guess
the thing is we have so many eight extra
hearts compared to these other other
guys
when he calls then we block ajax i think
it's probably a fine play
i think an ace is a good
blocker for what it's worth we're
unblocking blocks we have a three
uh what what flesh do you have my friend
i have the flush
i have the king deuce clubs
the king eight clubs the queen eight
clubs ten eight flops
nine eight clubs
seven eight clubs i have a lot of
flashes
how do you go away
how
so you see that the king high flasher on
the flop and then check the turn
it's [ __ ] ridiculous
karasundi you are going to be the victim
of my 7-3 bed my friend
that's a good flopper
seven dudes never lose
i just show them drunken style
that's so unfortunate
it's so unfortunate
how do you fall there i three met seven
dudes lava seven was there's any faults
one second i'll flop a set here and then
i'll check who won
how we do it guys that's how we do it 23
9 85
69 actually 44 that seems close
13 13 xc is closer than 44.
um
[Music]

poker guys it's [ __ ] [ __ ]
