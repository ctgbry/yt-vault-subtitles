[00:00]
pocket aces orb seki wrong timing my
friend
wrong timing can you just open gems
we're obviously calling let's go
ul you ow mr tech that's very unlucky

[00:16]
ul you ow mr tech that's very unlucky
and we ship in a nice little pot german
calls us with aces
and it's just money everywhere it's just
raining money the weather forecast today
is it's raining money guys

do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to

[00:45]
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo hello hello hello hello
hello
boys and girls
[Music]
how are you all today

[01:01]
welcome back to another weko show where
today
as mentioned there are a couple of
limitations and a couple of
complications but as mentioned
i had actually already been playing for

[01:15]
i had actually already been playing for
i think one half hour
um like a bit more of a normal grind was
playing like 1k 2k
now we are here uh but the problem
always with
normal tables is that sometimes you have
too much tables and sometimes there is

[01:31]
too much tables and sometimes there is
no action at all
zoom is a little bit more consistent so
you know
just gonna take it from here and see
what happens because the third one just
started
which is this one so three three tables
three tables i think is a good
it's a good one we have three tables and
a replayer i think that would work well

[01:54]
a replayer i think that would work well
here we make a straight
i'm sure what i'm gonna do i think

[02:00]
i'm sure what i'm gonna do i think
actually i'm going to check this one
maybe a little bit a little bit funky
but
i think actually that works well and
just playing to the random factor if he
checks again
we probably have the best hand so
actually i'm going to make a small value

[02:15]
actually i'm going to make a small value
but
sometimes he's going to call us with
like pocket force with the club but i
think it's way more likely he just has
to bear or something
or an ace to bear it's nine
here faces squeeze i'm going to make a
little gold form

[02:30]
little gold form
and getting the money in if necessary
necessary guys we also throw the rest of
the stack in no problem
[Music]
this board i'm gonna make a small c bet
i'm probably looking to barrel

[03:02]
interesting river
i think now the best action is probably

[03:16]
check
reevaluate the situation
i think jamming is a little bit thin so
you have pocket jacks
not really sure i would have checked i

[03:30]
not really sure i would have checked i
mean i started to stream so most
probably after clicking start stream
we're probably calling
uh because i think he could probably jam
ace king himself that's an option
and there are some bluffs that we can
think of uh
i mean if you if you look for bloss guys

[03:45]
i mean if you if you look for bloss guys
you will find it
uh because basically you could have
maybe end like five six suited h5 suited
like a six seven suited that he might
turn into a bluff
we do suit it playing 10 20 so
in general you can defend a little bit

[04:01]
in general you can defend a little bit
more as the rake
is a little bit less i would say have
you ever seen me full
3d suited on stream i don't think so
right
not gonna start this time

[04:15]
not gonna start this time
in a bad spot which is a good sizing on
this board mainly going to continue by
calling and i think three deuce is
fine hand to call
oh yeah baby and we're gonna

[04:30]
oh yeah baby and we're gonna
lead out small
building calls and i'm actually
going to lead out small again on the

[04:45]
going to lead out small again on the
river
and will unfold six seven queen
whatever little c bet

[05:07]
there's a five
interesting card actually gonna go for

[05:15]
interesting card actually gonna go for
the check
spot actually i'm gonna do quite some
checking quite a lot of checking quite
some checking is that is that a word
and they're going to do quite a lot of
checking
and the bats

[05:33]
don't mind ripping it in here i think
that's actually a fine play
would have preferred to have like 7 8
but i don't think this is that bad

[05:45]
but i don't think this is that bad
so let's just do that and then the snap
calls with
the very or decently top of his range
and this is obviously
the worst hand to face so i think that's
quite unlucky
i think if he has a hand like king queen
there for example uh
he's in a little bit of a tough spot

[06:01]
he's in a little bit of a tough spot
well we let's
let's just go back to flopping sets how
we usually do it here on the stream
right
it's in general way more profitable
business
but let's continue that business
actually just gonna race

[06:15]
actually just gonna race
versus the recreational
don't really want to have hope floki
being able to just draw with anything

[06:43]
definitely barreling would you say

[06:53]
and jamming the river as you might
imagine
when one holds a set

[07:09]
he's thinking about it guys come on man
pay
he has an ace ha thank you

[07:17]
he has an ace ha thank you
sir thank you sir
who your suckers think you're tripping
with yes i'm the boss
calling a 3-bit sometimes called

[07:30]
calling a 3-bit sometimes called
sometimes four bet
we rolled 33 which is on the passive the
passive side
physical on the flop we don't have the
king queen
pseudoblocker which is unfortunate but
hey
cannot have it on turn we don't have a

[07:47]
cannot have it on turn we don't have a
club so i think we should probably just
call once more
as you can have quintana clubs ace queen
a screen with a club

[08:05]
the spot where i'm just going to do
quite a lot of folding on the flop
and now my range is actually decently
strong
so he decides to go for one third which

[08:16]
so he decides to go for one third which
is quite interesting on this
spot definitely calling again

[08:34]
i think versus this sizing scheme i
think we have a call

[08:49]
i think he will bat queens himself for
for this
sizing what was the one third one turret
off pot
yeah i don't really think we can ever
fold queens and obviously you can still
have a bluff like

[09:00]
have a bluff like
ace five suited maybe if he was funky
with
poker bishop's favorite hand the five
four suited

[09:15]
oh we even have a sweat but he doesn't
hit so that's good
i'm gonna see right here on this table
we have quite a bad hand i think to be
barreling with
let's see what develops

[09:31]
i guess i'm gonna make another small bat
we made a little funky barrel here with
the jack-10 we don't really have much
but hey that doesn't really matter
because he folds guys
this is how we do it

[09:46]
well in the meantime guys we turned uh i
wanted to say turn the nuts but i don't
want to jinx it
here with the 5'4 gonna make a small bet
again
i think that's probably fine
[Music]

[10:00]
[Music]
when 2030 and the river unless
spade comes we're gonna review the true
strength of our hand
review it to mr nituma tree

[10:17]
review it to mr nituma tree
oh we're not very happy about this
situation
but i think we're definitely calling i
think a hand that he could be bluffing
with here is like for example i had like

[10:31]
with here is like for example i had like
pocket fives with the spade
the ace is quite interesting
as for example let's say you had a bluff
like ace queen with the ace of spades
it's now improved so i'm not really sure

[10:45]
it's now improved so i'm not really sure
if he's going to bluff it
so it's quite an interesting spot my
range also increased to like some 2
pairs ace king asus
he gems okay okay okay this is quite

[11:02]
he gems okay okay okay this is quite
interesting
right the nuts is probably check raising
on the flop
so if you check raise the nuts on the
flop most often he's basically not
saying he has a lower-ish flush

[11:17]
saying he has a lower-ish flush
which i think is very plausible
in terms of blobs yeah work mainly
looking at the ace queen with the ace of
spades for example
but he doesn't really have much offsuit

[11:30]
but he doesn't really have much offsuit
combinations in these positions so
that's quite dicey
i'm actually gonna lay this one down and
give the guy credit if he bluffed me
that's the problem you play against why

[11:45]
that's the problem you play against why
you play against his team poke ambition
guys
at this flop this flop is in general
quite good for me as i'll be raising
like some trashy hands in this region
and his checkout is a little bit more in
the medium region

[12:03]
and actually i also don't mind following
this up with a barrel
i think of sizing

[12:22]
all right we we have it guys
he says all right i'll i'll keep it
exciting he had the ace of spades

[12:31]
exciting he had the ace of spades
okay it's quite dicey we made actually a
little barrel
with the king 10 here
so he had the ace of spades so what was

[12:45]
so he had the ace of spades so what was
his other card guys what was his other
card
oh he actually leads the river now it is

[13:00]
oh he actually leads the river now it is
quite funky
this is very funky
hmm he says he has a six
horse or fives

[13:16]
but we also have quite a l6s this is
quite funky guys

[13:33]
i want to see it [ __ ] good force
[ __ ] it force so sometimes it's just
what you think it is
[ __ ] force that was a good call guys

[13:48]
[ __ ] force that was a good call guys
oh my god that's got to be the greatest
call
nice try though nice try gotta give
credit where credit is due i like it
when people try
and we flop a set but the people were we

[14:00]
and we flop a set but the people were we
were still we stayed hanging after the
after the raid
our flop set percentage usually on
stream is on on the
on the higher side this is one of these
good situations we didn't check raises
okay okay okay

[14:15]
we are still interested so let's
continue
we didn't know i actually barrels again
i think bottom set
i'm not going to race i'm still just
going to call
the bad river
i think i'm gonna bluff uh bluff

[14:32]
i think i'm gonna bluff uh bluff
that
not too big though offbot i think is
fine
okay we had a set over set and we only

[14:45]
okay we had a set over set and we only
managed to lose half
not even half for stack so i think
actually that's
quite a decent scenario i would say oh
no problem
getting some of that uh zoom on here
guys from finland usually when you see
finland
i'm more inclined to trap but let's go

[15:02]
i'm more inclined to trap but let's go
for it
let's just
finland calls it off with ace king
obviously perfectly standard we dodge
one

[15:15]
one
are we gonna dutch two yes so we dutch
two guys
we dutch two let's go
[Music]

[15:31]
what you gonna do what you gonna do when
otb
comes for you otb otb otv
makes a little four bets because he's
otp
i'm gonna go away and i'll give myself
the chicken song

[15:46]
the chicken song
[Music]
oh to be too good guys no no no i'm not
gonna [ __ ] around with oh there's a
c-bet here
10-4 probably a hand that's often
calling twice

[16:00]
now especially

[16:16]
blocks again
i think a race is not probably
appropriate

[16:30]
we have the dream river

[16:45]
i'm gonna decide to go for a little over
but a little bit thin ish
so we go from the check back with the
ace queen with over bet here with m4
and he tank tank tank tank tank folds

[17:00]
he checks i'm gonna check but we get
second return shout out to mrsak
a little ten percent i like it
don't think i'm gonna raise seven eight
actually i could actually raise seven

[17:15]
actually i could actually raise seven
eight probably not the end of the world
we raise seven eight
i think seven eight sets definitely
raising
a lower straight definitely not raising
but this could be okay

[17:32]
but this could be okay
not sure maybe only a set
or something like a set in a flush and
then bluffs
actually think that's more realistic but
not a great race
for the same reasons i was actually

[17:45]
for the same reasons i was actually
going to check back if he checks i think
that's the same reason i should not
raise the flop
but hey we cannot go back in time so we
should have maybe thought about that
true before we made the race
mr wacko
now i have no [ __ ] clue anymore

[18:00]
now i have no [ __ ] clue anymore
what's going on
have you ever caught up with fintan easy
with aces also malta no i've never
caught up with him
next up with zian type

[18:16]
and your man decides that he has a seven
actually i don't think that's the case
he just has a good hand so
i like split phases three video with ace

[18:31]
i like split phases three video with ace
four
going to call code actually also four
but some of the time
usually like the suited wheel aces i
think play well as four bets
when you get deeper but i don't think

[18:45]
when you get deeper but i don't think
i'm gonna do
a lot of forbidding here i'm not too
sure actually any any deep sex
specialists here
i do know whether we play deep stacked
or short sex that this is quite a damn
good hand
unblocks i'm definitely going to race
now

[19:03]
and checking down the h8 expecting to
win
or chop versus s8 as well
and then it falls okay guys we have a
retry
ever we tried to make the gto boys crowd

[19:16]
ever we tried to make the gto boys crowd
come on four bed seki
we want to make the gto boys proud
we're craving for that validation of the
gto community
who as soon as they see a stand are
trying to get their stack in

[19:37]
ah hey guys let's make the gto community
proud
and go for a little jam

[20:00]
i had a feeling he was going to fall oh
we call a little through it with the
pocket jacks and because we're streaming
and because i'm the wacom because this
is the wacko show we flop a set
a set ain't bad
a set in bed

[20:18]
oh you have quite a lot of jacks
let me go for a little bet here

[20:38]
and actually i think i'm going to go for
a little bed again on the river
let's see what jarman does

[20:48]
let's see what sec does we're more
interested in that huh jeremy
did go for the race as i sort of oh
trendy go for the perfect as well
okay we're going to rip in the jacks
we're going to call

[21:00]
we're going to call
the aces and here are the jacks yes we
now
uh have a tough decision
queen yeah
[ __ ] it asis warp seki wrong timing my

[21:15]
[ __ ] it asis warp seki wrong timing my
friend
wrong timing can you just open gems

[21:47]
trap me with the aces guys
trying to trap me with the bucket aces
how sick is that how sick is that
and here we also decided to check to him
twice
pretend like we have a tough decision
