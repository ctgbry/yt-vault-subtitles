[00:00]
go where is charlie i am lucky lucky
check seven suited damn two lifeguards
oh [ __ ]
that's good um yes
yes wait why did he i was a little bit

[00:16]
yes wait why did he i was a little bit
confused
because i said oh no hey thank you very
much sir
much appreciated

[00:30]
much appreciated
do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo yes yes yes the party is
on its way
how are you guys welcome back

[00:45]
how are you guys welcome back
to another wacko show there's a three
bed here this hand can
sometimes yeah sometimes
four bed actually four bed
okay the mood has been established
you can sometimes forbid okay before

[01:01]
you can sometimes forbid okay before
that
any calls
okay board for the four better
as soon as usually a kink rolls off then

[01:16]
as soon as usually a kink rolls off then
you have the
the the the ace king advantage i will
also forbade king queen off
some of the time here king jack off like
some k9 suited
king 7 suited maybe so i think this

[01:30]
king 7 suited maybe so i think this
board
hits my range quite well so let's just
start off with one bat
and go from there turn is quite
interesting
this is a quite interesting turn

[01:52]
i'm gonna mark this hand because i find
the turn the turn is interesting
you actually saw me considering like a
half pot bet

[02:03]
like i noticed turn definitely has quite
a lot of gems
it's an interesting turn

[02:21]
and we both have a straight okay
i prefer to play this hand right the
aces
the asus

[02:36]
the asus
river is quite interesting as well right
it's a spot where
it's very hard actually for us to have
bluffs

[02:48]
just gonna call this and usually get it
in on the turn there's not a lot of
turns that will really kill
killer action versus the king except
dave the eight of clubs

[03:09]
about small
a little bit tempted to just race

[03:27]
i'm gonna go for a very small race and

[03:30]
i'm gonna go for a very small race and
kind of focus on
getting action from a king this thing
with the small sizing here on the turn
he could have the king quite easily
the downside obviously is that he's
gonna fold his bluffs so a little three
right here with our favorite hand

[03:47]
right here with our favorite hand
brazier friends from the uk
estoy gordo
sounds a little bit polish or at least
eastern european

[04:03]
okay four bets let's
let's check it out
oh that's an open-ender

[04:16]
oh let's go i'm lucky i'm skillful i'm
still full
you gotta win this hand because he has
stopped there
and i make it straight he doesn't know
it yet
it's going to happen yeah my friend

[04:31]
it's going to happen yeah my friend
you're investing money in a pot that
you're not gonna
we haven't notified for suited jesus
it's raining hands
hallelujah it's raining hence

[04:48]
you are in a lot of trouble my friends
you're in a lot of trouble gonna make a
little small betty

[05:03]
am i yes i am
and here we have the nuts and we're
going to jam
the river we're going to jam the river

[05:15]
the river we're going to jam the river
i think it's just time to ship it and
ship it and go to bed
any [ __ ] jacks gg sir
here we decided not not to have a four
you know that's how it goes
but thank you very much sir much
appreciated

[05:33]
[Music]
i'm gonna make a small bit here with the
pocket sixes with a heart
i think on a turn we can definitely mix
a seven especially when the flush

[05:45]
a seven especially when the flush
completes doesn't necessarily already
want a bad bic
and we over limped with the four six as
you know it can flop straight
flushes don't really want to raise and
get three but
and here we make a flush we're probably
gonna proceed by doing a lot of small

[06:01]
gonna proceed by doing a lot of small
betting again i would say
so that's what we're going to do
[Music]
here kind of similar story i would say
so i'm just going to check

[06:16]
so i'm just going to check
goose core paid us off
versus that little bet and he called us
up with a jack
okay so the little bat was perfect
i like this bed a lot too this is really
really kind of sexy

[06:30]
really kind of sexy
i get three butts i think i'm just gonna
ship
girls with jax can we suck out
oh is it us against pokerstars or us
against cucio

[06:46]
resume okay oh that's always my friend
bad choice
that's how you lose money in life with
bad choices everybody over the jack 10
and in meanwhile we got a a rate thank

[07:00]
and in meanwhile we got a a rate thank
you mr weasel
for the for the rady
while we see that here with the jack ten
good luck today mate thank you very much

[07:15]
good luck today mate thank you very much
mr weasel
turn us a deuce
interesting turn

[07:30]
interesting turn
gonna bet again
actually i also don't mind just check
calling once
actually maybe that's a better strategy

[07:46]
not sure we have tents definitely nines
are having a jack
not really sure about river sizing

[08:00]
not really sure about river sizing
probably could have bettered bigger
i think i literally pressed all buttons
three quarters half pot one third
but i decided to go for the triple block

[08:19]
any triple calls down
thank you very much sir he had ace
five okay
much appreciated mate

[08:35]
king queen
go for a bet
but i often check i think that's one big

[08:45]
but i often check i think that's one big
blind
which not yeah
it raises some time don't
mind racing kind of depends on how often
in three bets we have an easy hand
we have a okay hand to call twice
believe it or not

[09:01]
believe it or not
versus basically everything he checks
and then we just check and hope to win
okay he gave up he gave up chicken song

[09:15]
okay he gave up he gave up chicken song
let's
[Music]
i'm go to check all here with the pocket
aces
what would you say it's gto correct full

[09:31]
what would you say it's gto correct full
to three bets
in 2050 i have like 56 and i feel it's
on the high side but i see you for more
than me
but you are the mega pro not me
reason no somewhere somewhere around
that is a fine full percentage i would

[09:45]
that is a fine full percentage i would
say
basic the barrel easy call
river eight that's interesting shouldn't
be
too much h for the sizing scheme that he
used in my opinion

[10:02]
gems think i'm going to go
we're blocking ace 8 which is an 8 that
he should always barrel twice with this
sizing we're blocking ace 4
or unblocking a hand with a 6 in it or

[10:16]
or unblocking a hand with a 6 in it or
something so yeah
not very happy but i'm just gonna call
down
and he blocked us with the six seven no
chicken song for him
but all the money for us you know people
are just trying to avoid the chicken
chicken song

[10:32]
chicken song
[Music]
here with the queens i'm going to
approach this spot
with a check

[10:47]
with a check
we have a nut that i do turn here with a
king
i'm gonna go for check again now we face
a little delay here
i'm going to be calling

[11:01]
i'm going to be calling
six seven when check two with a six i'm
probably going to check
here we face a bet on the river and i
think we have a call we're blocking
queen jack suited
i think there is a likely chance that he
could have already batted
tan jack suited maybe some of the time

[11:15]
tan jack suited maybe some of the time
on the flop so
i just hope here that he's trying to
block me off something with like a low
power or a random
classic suited or something
but he just has a jack okay

[11:30]
but he just has a jack okay
back to the bank because i'm checking
down what he said in the moment so i
need to pop it okay
i have a guy going all in uh let's go
where's charlie i am lucky lucky
check seven suited damn two lifeguards

[11:46]
check seven suited damn two lifeguards
oh [ __ ]
that's good um yes
yes wait why did he i was a little bit
confused because i said oh no
hey thank you very much sir much
appreciated

[12:00]
appreciated
where is my uh where is my uh first
let's solve for white we're going to
check back here with the
ace jacket diamonds

[12:19]
place it back here we don't have the
nuts nuts
i also don't really have a redraw if you
like just calling this hand i prefer way
more raising
a two pair type of holding or a set you

[12:33]
a two pair type of holding or a set you
would have that
here i think now if he checks we can
probably bet
our two pairs and i think we should be
now bluffing
some ants like queen seven

[12:47]
some ants like queen seven
queen eight i think this sizing is fine
and if we raise i think we have an easy
goal unless it goes all in
here we have a little over bet with six
seven off space we're gonna turn the

[13:00]
seven off space we're gonna turn the
five of spades
and then the fourth space on the river
and we're gonna make a little victory
dance that's what we're gonna do that is
not
the turn that we were looking for five
four definitely barreling i think
actually this is
it's not it's not the end of the world

[13:16]
it's not it's not the end of the world
hand to barrel
actually i think that's what we're gonna
do
a little bit funky but hey we are a
funky
player

[13:30]
he calls
this is in gto what we call a triple
barrel

[13:45]
but i'm going to chicken out oh yeah ace
deuce
chicken song for me guys
[Music]
i'm gonna go for a call would sometimes
check raise but reasonably low

[14:01]
check raise but reasonably low
number
so am i making a little blocky blocky
here

[14:18]
raises
i think there's not much else left to do

[14:30]
i think there's not much else left to do
than call
i think we're gonna re-raise this
interesting river you could also say

[14:45]
interesting river you could also say
raise a turn because you still have a
regional to like the super nuts but then
again he can have also
kington which is the super nuts
any chance we have the nuts obviously
we're calling
yeah this is actually one of these hands
that i was kind of hoping for

[15:01]
that i was kind of hoping for
it's a great it's a great candidate to
be bluffing with as you're blocking the
nuts kingdom suited and you're blocking
a7 suited
so shout out to mr big sealer for
throwing out the bluff
and shout out for us or slow playing

[15:16]
and shout out for us or slow playing
and making the money
very small

[15:31]
convincing vlog
hmm
i check

[15:45]
one big blind

[16:01]
let's put a small bed back to him now
let's see what he does
he calls
ha that was a good small bet on the
river guys we we earned the 10

[16:15]
river guys we we earned the 10
i would say because he would have
definitely checked this behind
so shout out to me guys shout out to me
this time
oh my god am i the best
admit it said say it you have to say it

[16:30]
admit it said say it you have to say it
gotta say it guys gotta say five six
student
obviously not folding as this is one of
our favorite hands
okay flop for a suited versus check race
i would just get it in

[16:45]
i would just get it in
now it pots
i think this hand just probably jams
it just has so much equity even versus
better hand and i can just get worse
hands to

[17:01]
hands to
a lot of better hands to fault i don't
think i'm gonna get a lot of action on
my hits
obviously we prefer to have a back door
but i think even with out the back door
it's jamming
is it jamming without the back door just
gonna go for it

[17:16]
actually i'm slowly gonna sit down
to close off as the session is coming to
an end
and so is my lower back
as i had an intensive workout

[17:32]
as i had an intensive workout
she posted a little clip of it on my in
on the instagram of pokemission if
you're curious go check that out
also delayed answered some of the
questions from the live q a
but yeah you can sign go over to the
site you can actually

[17:46]
site you can actually
watch a free 30 minutes demo i actually
also got some messages some people that
have re-watched the demo of the
mechanics and learned a lot so
hi great for you guys we got that
queen's hands
where we went for the little trappy
trappy trap trappy trappy and

[18:00]
trappy trap trappy trappy and
he actually also went for a little
trapper trapper trappy we
we gave ourselves a little chicken son
with the six seven
i think our bluff on the river should
just be 10 jack as i think he's not
folding a7
or his jack so i like my double barrel

[18:17]
or his jack so i like my double barrel
even though this hand is obviously
complete [ __ ]
i actually thought he would already fold
some
ace 4 h5 is deuce as doozy doesn't
really have much but i figured he would
already have folded some h45 another

[18:30]
already have folded some h45 another
river yeah he's gonna have ace 10 ace
jack
river some ace eights and then ace nine
or higher
yeah ace nine's probably not folding so
then we're kind of blocking
his faults with a6 a7 so that's why i
kind of gave up that hand
i think the turn barrel is fine

[18:47]
i think the turn barrel is fine
we did actually lose quite a lot of
medium pots
actually i don't think this one came on
stream where i threw back the
recreational check back and called twice
a river the queen four so got owned

[19:00]
a river the queen four so got owned
there
got owned quite hard
[Music]
we also had this one this one was also
versus recreational where
i'm trying to put a little bit more
pressure on those guys
but it'll flush i'm not really sure if
this is the correct spot to do so

[19:16]
this is the correct spot to do so
i'm gonna reevaluate that one later
this user goes right you have like a
a certain goal okay i want to maybe uh
do something a little bit more often
then you know that in that process

[19:30]
then you know that in that process
you're gonna sometimes make some errors
uh it's just the natural calibration
process uh as i'm sure
everyone can relate with

[19:45]
for the rest i think yeah for the rest i
think it was a fine session
god mainly got donated some stacks or at
least we had like the top of our range
and they decided to bluff so that's
always good
so thank you guys all for watching and
see you in the next stream on
