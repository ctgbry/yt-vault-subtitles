Adam feder has been competing in the
poker space for I think over 10 years
now what qualities or trades does one

[02:01]
now what qualities or trades does one
need to possess in order to reach this
level of
longevity I think the first one's got to
be a Love of the Game a real passion and
drive and curiosity to like the game and
want to get better at it you say the
same with pads who we spoke to on the on

[02:16]
same with pads who we spoke to on the on
this podcast as well about his longevity
I think the second one is probably the
ability to adapt and to always think
outside the box I think if you're going
have a long career at some point you
need to reinvent yourself and reinvent
your strategy I know of fed solvas into

[02:32]
your strategy I know of fed solvas into
his way studying has been a big thing as
well and then like a growth mindset
always be learning always be improving
and those in that next thing that next
thing that you want to work on and
strive towards so yeah that's just my
take on it hopefully feda will give us a

[02:45]

without further Ado let's start chatting
with fader holes all right feder welcome
to the Pod thanks for having me well
you've had an amazing career to put it
lightly and it's hard to know where to
begin with your story but I want to dive
in with 2014 which was kind of your

[04:00]
in with 2014 which was kind of your
breakthrough year at least on the
outside talk us through what changed
that year this was a year you got voted
play of the year on pocket 5es I'm
guessing this didn't just happen
overnight talk us through like back that
part of your career what was happening
in the buildup and what were some of the
changes you made going into the

[04:17]
changes you made going into the
2014 um I would say financially my uh
most meaningful year before that was
2013 where I basically went from zero
being broke not really knowing what to
do next and um I did a World trip I um I

[04:35]
do next and um I did a World trip I um I
think I probably went from yeah about
zero to a million in in that year before
and surprisingly the next year
financially didn't uh wasn't that big of

[04:45]
financially didn't uh wasn't that big of
a shift but was more in reputation
because I won the W coup
Main and um did decent online and so I
think the accumulation of uh of wins and
then also the the pocket fives

[05:00]
then also the the pocket fives
um theader board um I think I was number
one there for quite some time so I think
that kind of brought me on the the the
map for for other online players so it
was I would say 2013 was making the
money and then 2014 was people starting

[05:15]
money and then 2014 was people starting
to recognize my name and and me and then
with that comes you know interviews and
and I played live so people start to
approach me on the life table so um yeah
I think that was kind of my entry into
um into the high scene and and also

[05:30]
um into the high scene and and also
connecting more with with the
international
scene so when did everything start to
click for you so we said 2013 was
actually the year where a lot of the
success and financial success happened
when did things start to really start to
come together so obviously I'm guessing
you had a lot of success building up to

[05:45]
you had a lot of success building up to
that but when did you start to feel like
I've got a real big Edge in these games
and I'm one of the the best players in
MTS right now to be honest I I really
try to tell the story in a way that that
I experienced because I think it is very
easy to to give it now a different spin

[06:01]
easy to to give it now a different spin
you know it's very easy now to just
explain things in a way because nobody
was there and nobody really knows um but
to be honest it wasn't very fluid it
wasn't very obvious either I would say
um end of 2012 I put in quite some work

[06:19]
um end of 2012 I put in quite some work
to get better and I tried to connect
with a lot of players but I was staked
and played maybe $50 $60 average Buy in
I think there were players around me

[06:30]
I think there were players around me
that saw potential in me but in terms of
actual win rate on the tables I think it
was okay but not
outstanding and then I cannot tell you
what exactly happened to be honest I I
think between that time I think a really
big shift was if I could pick out one

[06:47]
big shift was if I could pick out one
thing it was just a mental state I was
in so in 2012 I would say it was
more uh it felt like the one thing
everything felt options and the one
thing I really like which was poker

[07:00]
thing I really like which was poker
didn't work so that felt
very um it was pretty depressing in the
sense of there's nothing really out
there for me and the one thing I like
it's also not working so just this this
feeling of uh no Outlook um and and then

[07:18]
feeling of uh no Outlook um and and then
I I think I made a good choice of of
doing a World trip and kind of stopping
to play grinding um grinding a lot and I
think that kind of took that back and

[07:30]
think that kind of took that back and
just gave me a different perspective and
then I think I had more uh more space
and and a better perspective to just
focus on a bit longer time scale and
just hey I'm in a decent space I have
enough money to live for the next eight
months or 12 months so I'm not under

[07:46]
months or 12 months so I'm not under
that much pressure I just got to keep
going and so I think having having fun
in other areas outside of life and kind
of seeing Oh there's I don't have to
succeed the next month I think that
really helped me to uh have just just
more less stress and I think out of that

[08:02]
more less stress and I think out of that
came just me playing better and then I
think once there was this click
where um I felt like oh actually I am I
I have an edge I talk to the right
people I have a good group of people and

[08:16]
people I have a good group of people and
I feel like I'm beating these games
there was not really that much beyond
that right if you played back then
average buy 50 you could maybe play 150
but you couldn't really play
300 so I moved up to

[08:31]
300 so I moved up to
play basically up to Sunday 500 and
super Tuesday were like the bigger games
back then and and I felt like I was a
winner in those and that just kind of
uh yeah that that sealed the deal but I

[08:47]
uh yeah that that sealed the deal but I
I think the really deciding thing is
obviously I ran a lot above dollar a and
and and doing well in the biggest bins I
I played or bought action in and um I
think that was probably the um the
differentiator so I Tred to like I think

[09:01]
differentiator so I Tred to like I think
I was a good winner I think I did some
things right but I I think also it's
just a lot of Randomness and and
everything
involved so you mentioned this shift in
your mental state and it sounded like it
came from this traveling around getting
more wider perspectives and almost like

[09:15]
more wider perspectives and almost like
taking that kind of pressure off
yourself that you had to play poker um
curious to know what your experience was
like when you came back to the tables
with this less pressure less stress on
you how did that impact your performance
dayto day and almost your enjoyment of
the gamees as well how did how did that

[09:31]
the gamees as well how did how did that
change I mean again in hindsight it's
always hard to say exactly how it was
back then because I I I really do think
one of the biggest differentiating
factors was I won a tournament then I
was out of makeup I quit the staking and

[09:48]
was out of makeup I quit the staking and
I think that enabled in a way for me to
just I had some money I maybe 10,000 or
8,000 so I think being at that point
where there was less pressure it's not
only mentor is also the the environment

[10:01]
only mentor is also the the environment
so I think those two things played
together where I had more mental
capacity because um because I could
remove myself from from just having
these thoughts but then also a few
things um went my way and I think then

[10:15]
things um went my way and I think then
kind of the combination of those two
things uh that that would without it I
think it would have been difficult to
get out of that
spiral so things were starting to come
together in terms of results external
success you got play of the year 14 you
won the w c main event for 1.3 million

[10:32]
won the w c main event for 1.3 million
2015 you also followed that up again
with po per the year on the surface it
sounds like almost everything is
clicking and everything's going in One
Direction in a linear F Wills wins
everything but in reality behind the
scenes that kind of wasn't what was
happening and I know you had a a bad

[10:46]
happening and I know you had a a bad
patch where externally you were getting
good results but actually you were in
bad staking deals or you were actually
not doing well profit wise so can you
explain that part of the game I'm sure
was 2014 or 2015 where you were actually
on a losing streak and you were losing
part of your bankr scoll um even though

[11:00]
part of your bankr scoll um even though
the outside it looked like you were
doing quite well yeah sure I think I
was I would guess maybe at somewhere
between 1.3 and 1.5 million in
2014 um I surprisingly I did a mistake
actually with my w CP main I I don't

[11:16]
actually with my w CP main I I don't
think I talked a lot about this but I I
actually did a mistake with my w coup
main event I swapped and I for we did a
swap for the entire series and I forgot
the swap on the last Sun day and um

[11:31]
the swap on the last Sun day and um
because it was for particular event so I
swapped with a few High six players and
then I sold some action and then when I
played the tournament a bit later I
realized oh wait I had the Swap and I
forgot about the swap so I think I I
sold like 30% or something and then I

[11:45]
sold like 30% or something and then I
swapped another 40 so I had way less
percent than I would normally take uh
action myself in in tournament like this
so um this one didn't make as big of a
difference as uh as people thought so I
think that was kind of the the start of
things were um was maybe at let's say

[12:03]
things were um was maybe at let's say
1.5 million and I started playing H
rollers not so long after so I think in
2015 I started playing H rollers and um
I think generally at that time it was

[12:15]
I think generally at that time it was
mostly you did not have that many
options to put in a lot of
buyin it was or a lot of dollars so you
had basically pretty condensed High
rulers but then there wasn't so much in
the middle there weren't that any 5Ks
there wasn't really any online action

[12:31]
there wasn't really any online action
between 1K or let's say 1K above it was
a few main events but that's about it
and so in terms of tournaments high
buyin this was a pretty big part of your
of your buyin so if you play 5Ks 10ks
25ks if you don't do well in those that

[12:46]
25ks if you don't do well in those that
can end up adding up to uh to lots of
dollars and um and so you can you can
cash something where you maybe have few
like I cashed I think 100K but obviously
I have less action there than in a 25k

[13:00]
I have less action there than in a 25k
so if you bust 6 25k bullets that hurts
more so it's like it's hard to the
outside to actually have an idea of how
much you're winning or losing and I
think the other the second point was
staking deals I had I wasn't very
experienced in it um at least in terms

[13:16]
experienced in it um at least in terms
of in terms of the organization aspect
so when things don't go so well when you
have someone like the accounting side of
things to make sure that when someone
tries to take advantage of you in a
position like this then to to check that
and to see it so I had two people who

[13:30]
and to see it so I had two people who
stole some money from me and um I think
that then all adds up where you lose
100K there you're down 80k there and
then outside people see oh you cash for
300K in Monte Carlo you cash for 300K
there which was three buyin and 100K so

[13:45]
there which was three buyin and 100K so
um I think I lost about 40 50% of my
bank roll um in 2015 up
until maybe September
October and that was about a 9 10 months
stretch where everyone thought I'm just

[14:02]
stretch where everyone thought I'm just
it's just going further and for me it
was like this and and there was also
this this tension in talking about it
this was actually the difficult part I I
was not so worried about losing the
money it was more everyone give whenever

[14:16]
money it was more everyone give whenever
I ran deep somewhere people like ah you
know again it's so annoying and for me
it was more like hey guys I'm down 500k
like it's not uh so so I think this this
this tension that was more for me than
than losing the

[14:31]
than losing the
money yeah so during that patch were you
having any sort of concerns worries so
you're playing a lot more high rollers
you're experiencing some bad variants
maybe for the first time in your career
and you said the money didn't really
affect you too much but how were you

[14:45]
affect you too much but how were you
deal with that from a mindset
perspective and what were some of the
things you were trying to figure out as
you were trying to yeah kind of embed
yourself in the high Stak scene I would
say I dealt with it pretty poorly uh in
the sense of I was
very hard on myself I I I think I did

[15:03]
very hard on myself I I I think I did
very well online and I think I had a
very good idea of how people play online
and and to be honest also back then it
was a very variance free game style I
mean I basically
played 32 22 12 just uh had like 13 BB

[15:21]
played 32 22 12 just uh had like 13 BB
per 100 win rate uh a lot of the win
rate came from people under defending
and uh under flatting and under three
batting and foring too much against

[15:30]
batting and foring too much against
three bets so a lot of the money I made
was basically variance free because it's
the average pot size where your print
money is like 6 bb or something so it's
just you just raise and win all the time

[15:45]
just you just raise and win all the time
and people just defend too little so uh
so even comparing it to day now where
you have to fight much harder and the
money you make is a lot in the deeper
nodes and in higher average pot size and
leads to more variant and and um so that

[16:01]
leads to more variant and and um so that
was a totally different game back then
it just really felt like you're you're
cruising um but in high rollers it's
it's it's low sample size you know you
have like you play there weren't that
many high rollers back then and and you
played 20 or 30 of those and I remember

[16:16]
played 20 or 30 of those and I remember
after 15 bullets I catched zero out of
the first 15 and I was just these guys
they you know they know exact they
always know what I have it it really
felt like when it was kind of this I I
um I just bust I played two hours and

[16:30]
um I just bust I played two hours and
busted like every time every time I
entered H roller and at some point I
thought like okay because these guys
don't play online a lot of them didn't
so uh Dan Smith maybe played a bit
online but the Germans like iGo
kov Phil gri like they played sometimes

[16:46]
kov Phil gri like they played sometimes
but barely so it was kind of a separate
pool I thought apparently these guys
just always know when I have it when I
Bluff and uh yeah that really got into
my head so that's when I started working
with with Elliot and and started taking

[17:02]
with with Elliot and and started taking
my mental game more
serious what was some of the main
obstacles you were experiencing with
your mental game in that period as you
mentioned there was this like almost
like these guys know what I've got these
guys are ahead of me and using that
small sample size to uh almost like

[17:17]
small sample size to uh almost like
overreact so what were the main things
you working with alate you came across
in terms of you need to step up your
your mindset
approach I mean definitely the first one
I think a lot of poker players
experience um I would I would say along

[17:31]
experience um I would I would say along
the lines of imposter syndrome so I
don't belong here I'm not good enough to
be here I would say the second one is
to not trust myself like I I really had
struggles

[17:45]
struggles
to believe in the things I'm
doing so online is this Arena and I I
really believed in the things I was
doing there and just felt like riding a
bicycle but then now this new Arena and

[18:00]
bicycle but then now this new Arena and
it's so different and I didn't really
believe in the things that because
sudden apparently they're not really
working so I was um questioning my
abilities and my actions way too much so
um that was the second big big part and
I think the third part was

[18:15]
I think the third part was
really also came out of a confidence
thing is is
really
um seeing them
for for I think I kind of put them on a
p pedestal subconsciously or like these

[18:32]
p pedestal subconsciously or like these
high players they amass millions of
caches I'm just a new guy I have to
prove myself like I don't belong to the
circle yet you know like and and just
make them human you know just uh they're
also players they also play online I can

[18:45]
also players they also play online I can
also look at their stats and how do I
feel
about you know playing against Dan Smith
online and then suddenly it's like H
yeah you know it's fine so why why is it
so different so um I think that that was
a third point just
um I I think I do belong there and and

[19:03]
um I I think I do belong there and and
believing that and working on and why I
don't believe that and then working
through these different situations I
think that helped a lot I love that how
to make them human and how to take it
back to a game Dynamic which you were
already doing very well with online it's

[19:16]
already doing very well with online it's
really interesting to hear about you
speaking about imposter syndrome because
it often feels like you're the kind of
guy who has high belief always you were
like this young 21y old 22y old kid and
you were jumping in the high stakes
games playing anyone and had a lot of
success fairly quickly but at the same
time like you were also struggling

[19:30]
time like you were also struggling
during those early days and I think some
people underestimate how much struggles
you have to go through to kind of get
those successes at the end so I'm I'm
wondering for you um how did you start
to work on the belief in yourself so you
mentioned you were lacking a little bit
of confidence at this time your results
weren't kind of backing it up what was

[19:46]
weren't kind of backing it up what was
some of the work you had to do on
yourself to to realize you belonged
there obviously results probably came
later but what was some of the work you
were doing to try to uh to build that
belief system that you could actually
get get success in these games it's it's
kind of silly but again I want to give
you the the the most truest

[20:01]
you the the the most truest
representation of what happened but I I
think I just really went in there with a
very simple strategy is to get to the
point where I believe they're
terrible so just just work
towards thinking that they suck as

[20:17]
towards thinking that they suck as
players and so my only goal was to just
find weaknesses and I think that's where
I spent so I was very attentive when I
played
um I tried I looked at all the hands I

[20:31]
um I tried I looked at all the hands I
played against them online I looked at
other hands they played against other
people online like or friends their
databases back then it wasn't so
sophisticated um just ask friends like
how what do you think how this guy plays

[20:45]
how what do you think how this guy plays
or what a weaknesses of him I watched
all the footage there is on YouTube of
how they
play until a point where I felt very on
a very simple level against everyone I
have a few things where I think that you
know this guy this this wrong or you
know these three points or this guy has

[21:00]
know these three points or this guy has
a leak there where you know he FS to
much to three bets um or he under C bets
this spot or you know he FS to much to
check raises and just like developing
these different uh weaknesses of players
and that really helped me to just feel
like whenever I play against someone I'm

[21:15]
like whenever I play against someone I'm
like okay you know this is this is this
guy and and that helped me even though
it didn't matter for 80% of the hands I
played against them which just helped me
to be like ah yeah I I know something
they're not that good at I like this
because it's very practical as well and

[21:31]
because it's very practical as well and
often when people think about having
belief they think they can just almost
like install it into their kind of hard
drive of thinking but in reality there's
a level of for you level of work
preparation and almost like a dedication
to your craft so that when you sit down
with these players you know you're

[21:45]
with these players you know you're
prepared to play you know how they play
their style as you mentioned trying to
find weaknesses and believe in
everyone's terrible but also like doing
the work like find leaks that you at
least give you confidence when you
played against these players that you
could actually not only play well
against them but actually beat these
guys so yeah I think often like the some

[22:01]
guys so yeah I think often like the some
of the missing pieces of like how do you
believe in yourself comes down to like
the work you need to do to instill in
yourself at that stage that I'm good
enough to belong here so for you was the
idea always to transition from online to
live or did that come naturally did you

[22:15]
live or did that come naturally did you
almost like complete the online game and
just kind of end up in live games or was
that always part of the trajectory for
you he I think I never really made plans
about this I started playing
live before or at the same time as I
played online so for me it was it was

[22:34]
played online so for me it was it was
always without a doubt but also without
planning the thing that I wanted to do
and that was clear to me that I that I
will do as part of my

[22:45]
will do as part of my
career your skill sets as a poker player
do you think they're more suited to
online or live especially this time they
say 2015 2016 when you're very much in
both worlds where where do you think
your skills were most suited clearly
life
what is about life that makes you most

[23:01]
what is about life that makes you most
suited to
that um I do think the holistic approach
I think I was one of the few players
that just tried to squeeze every
everything I mean even there were also a

[23:16]
everything I mean even there were also a
lot of subconscious things if you look
at my demeanor for example there's a lot
of things now that that people forget
about but um a pretty big edge of mine
came from uh people disliking me to some
extent for different reasons right like

[23:31]
extent for different reasons right like
feeling threatened or um of what they
see in me or the image they have of me
um that made them play terrible against
me and that's also I think that was also
part of the game where there were

[23:45]
part of the game where there were
certain players that just you know they
were um they just played their game they
played
solid but also nobody did anything crazy
against them ever because they they're
solid so why would you do something

[24:01]
solid so why would you do something
crazy against them right so the hands I
played in some of these tournaments you
cannot imagine like people pted it off
against me in ways it's because what I
did it was like yes I did have that
demeanor but I didn't play I did play a
few out of line hands and when I thought

[24:16]
few out of line hands and when I thought
there was an edge I went after it but I
didn't go out of line just to be out of
line so I think a lot of people went out
of line against me just to go out of
line to make a stand to to you know to
make a point to to punish me to outplay

[24:30]
make a point to to punish me to outplay
me
and I think it is much harder to have
your emotions in control than it is to
understand in which emotion the other
person is and I think that is I think
that is one of my biggest strengths and
when I had I believe a a pretty big

[24:46]
when I had I believe a a pretty big
technical Advantage I think there were
basically no players that were able to
uh yeah I think um keep
up when did you you notice players were
starting to take a dislike in but also

[25:01]
starting to take a dislike in but also
like a fear of you and start to play
back at you was that after your one drop
win or when was it when you was had
enough success that players are starting
to uh maybe deviate strategy against
you I mean I think one of the things
that it depends a lot on the on the

[25:15]
that it depends a lot on the on the
level uh on Lower Stakes or mid Stakes
it happened pretty quickly just from
already the the the online background
and and one big part I basically don't
do anymore today but also it was
different times in in 2015 or

[25:31]
different times in in 2015 or
14 life poker was very different there
were very few players who
took demeanor and and information as
serious as some I think way more players
do today so I I looked at people all the

[25:47]
do today so I I looked at people all the
time and that was for some very
uncomforting so you know if you say oh
this guy staring at me all the time I
was one of the very few players who did
that very intensively and um
and now a lot of players do it or a lot

[26:00]
and now a lot of players do it or a lot
of players are looking but back then it
wasn't so common so in in low and mid
six a lot of people were uncomfortable
playing against me and I would say in
high stakes it was um probably most
during the time from end of 2015 to the

[26:16]
during the time from end of 2015 to the
summer of 16
where the thing that's also um not that
nice about poker in some way of course
is someone wins someone loses right
that's kind of I think that's nice but
also thing that's not so nice is in the

[26:30]
also thing that's not so nice is in the
high six Community you could really tell
is when I was winning 20 million the
money has to come from
somewhere so uh it it felt like uh a
personalization as well of me being the
reason why others are not progressing in

[26:45]
reason why others are not progressing in
the career or not reaching the goals
they they want to reach so that was uh
you could you could feel that in in the
room you're the end boss who's blocking
off everyone else for making money in
their career
careers and that's the thing you know it

[27:00]
careers and that's the thing you know it
wasn't necessarily this it wasn't this
like oh wow this guy's just on a
different level you know it was more
this oh this guy is just so lucky and
that that's a diff you know it had a bit
of a
different uh when someone is lucky it's
much easier to dislike right it's more

[27:16]
much easier to dislike right it's more
they're just blessed and and I think
there was in the high six community at
least in that time it didn't feel so
much like oh this guy is just uh just on
a different level just better you know
it it didn't feel like the the OTB Red
Baron it just felt more like uh oh this

[27:30]
Baron it just felt more like uh oh this
guy this guy is good but he just runs
and and actually you have to see back
then a lot of people thought I was doing
a lot of mistakes yeah so a lot of them
thought that I'm way too aggressive I I
play way too loose um so you from their

[27:46]
play way too loose um so you from their
perspective it's more I make a lot of
mistakes you know I play way to lose and
uh they do certain things better and I'm
getting lucky and rewarded for you know
so so I think I think it it just was a
bit of a different

[28:00]
bit of a different
narrative how was this affecting you in
terms of how other people were
portraying you relative to how you
portrayed yourself so at this stage
you're having a lot of success quickly
maybe people aren't giving you the
respect and credit you probably feel
like you deserve how was that impacting
you did you have some sort of chip on
your shoulder did it make you more

[28:15]
your shoulder did it make you more
competitive or were you just calm and
just playing your normal game
I I mean a lot of it I didn't you know
it's things happen so fast it's it's so
few moments it's not like I'm exposed to
this all the time but of course it did

[28:32]
this all the time but of course it did
something with me of course it hurt me
at times and um I think the
the it's not necessarily um I think it's
the the relative also in the big picture
of how much is is that and how much

[28:46]
of how much is is that and how much
other things and I think when it really
bothered me was or when I really
struggled was when I also felt my my
personal group is falling apart where we
didn't swap because
um they the difference in markup of how

[29:01]
um they the difference in markup of how
I sold action and how they sold action
was was so big it just um was that was
difficult back then to to swap pieces Al
also they had much smaller bank roll so
they took smaller pieces and so it just
felt like my success you know it's just

[29:16]
felt like my success you know it's just
kind of My Success and not a shared
success or their success in in some way
of for and also when they're doing well
I had a big piece of them so I just felt
like things are going well for me and
not necessarily you know some were
struggling in some ways and so I I could

[29:31]
struggling in some ways and so I I could
also feel that there was some envy and
and there was some tension I think
that's what that's what I I really
struggled with when I felt like hey okay
you know it's on the outside but it's
also it's also on the inside and and and
the really big reason there was because

[29:46]
the really big reason there was because
we're seven eight nine guys and then we
play these 50 40 30 Runner Fields
so you know you play against each other
all the time you I I felt like some of
them didn't want to share strategy as
much anymore it wasn't as much talking

[30:01]
much anymore it wasn't as much talking
about poker anymore and um I think that
kind of uh yeah made us drift apart in
some way and so I just felt a bit lonely
I
think that must have been challenging
for you as you're having more and more
success you're not getting alienated but

[30:17]
success you're not getting alienated but
you're creating a little bit of divide
between people around you both your peer
group and the external environment as
well and yeah it feels like there's less
connection and less people want to uh
it's weird cuz you feel like when you're
having success everyone wants to come
along for the ride and you're kind of

[30:30]
along for the ride and you're kind of
having more people around you but for
you it's seem is a little bit Isola so
um how are you dealing with that because
I I can see it that almost having
success at some points you can almost
climb to so high up the mountain that
other people can't even relate to you
and your where you're at so for you how
are you dealing with the the struggles

[30:46]
are you dealing with the the struggles
with your peer group let's call it where
basic people AR want to swap with you or
to maybe chat strategy as much how are
you kind of internalizing and dealing
with that on a personal
level um I don't remember so well but I
I remember that it it was really um it

[31:01]
I remember that it it was really um it
was really a struggle for me and and I
think also one of the big reasons I I
quit poker after that because it just
didn't feel worth it right it's like
when you run bad you run bad doesn't
feel great but it also felt a bit okay
when I run really good it also doesn't
feel that great you know yeah I made a

[31:16]
feel that great you know yeah I made a
lot of money now and and but I think the
the things I interpreted into the good
outcome just didn't feel close to as
good as I as I as I envisioned so I
think um
this the part that it felt like it

[31:32]
this the part that it felt like it
couldn't go any
better and that is the outcome I think
that was the
final a very
clear realization of oh if it can't go
any better I know how it how it is when

[31:45]
any better I know how it how it is when
it's when it's really bad but if that's
how it is when it's the absolute best
like I feel there's not really a reason
for me to continue pushing and trying to
pursue anything
here and that Point did it feel like you
had completed the game on a high so to

[32:00]
had completed the game on a high so to
speak like you got to the the level you
wanted to or was the level of a little
bit of maybe didn't feel like what it
expected to when you got there how was
it feeling around that time when you
were thinking about quitting poker and
moving on to new things I mean massive
low I wouldn't describe it as as a high

[32:15]
low I wouldn't describe it as as a high
I I played way too much I had lots of
side bets on wsp and caches and
bracelets and performance because I
thought okay this would be a good
incentive to make make these smaller
tournaments more interesting for me but

[32:30]
tournaments more interesting for me but
it was it was terrible I played seven
weeks for probably 11 12 hours on
average so lots of 14 15 hour days and I
came home and it just felt yeah I just
felt very drained and um yeah it was
just clear to me that that's not uh

[32:47]
just clear to me that that's not uh
that's certainly not what I want to
continue doing and I think I just needed
some time to to reflect and
regroup why do you think you were
playing so much at this time was it just
like out of habit you're constantly more

[33:00]
like out of habit you're constantly more
opportunities are coming available
there's higher games you're just in that
flow of grinding a lot do you feel like
that just momentum kept building and
building why do you feel like you felt
you needed at this stage of your career
to grind all those hours and play so
much I believe it's a bit moving from

[33:16]
much I believe it's a bit moving from
the inside to the to the outside so when
I when I play poker or when I study
poker a lot of it is very much or came
very much from the inside I'm very uh I
I think a lot of my habits are built on

[33:31]
I think a lot of my habits are built on
on needing energy from the inside which
which can be difficult in times but I'm
when I'm curious about something or
passionate about something it can just
my machine can just go for a very long
time and and and I try to focus on doing

[33:45]
time and and and I try to focus on doing
things where I have that that inner
drive and not do things where I don't
have that so I think I I have I have had
and still do have in Parts a very high
energy for poker and and learning it

[34:00]
energy for poker and and learning it
just just out of just for because it's
so complex and so many new things you
can learn and and and also the journey
you go through as a human like in it on
how you think perceive something a
certain way and then you realize there's

[34:16]
certain way and then you realize there's
something more to it and just go through
that hundreds and and thousands of times
so um I think I got to a point where
this motivation or or why I did things
moved more into the outside of my

[34:31]
moved more into the outside of my
perception of being a professional poker
player but also what I believe is
expected of me um which is just playing
the highest stakes and playing all the

[34:45]
the highest stakes and playing all the
tournaments basically and having results
so it wasn't a very conscious process
but I think subconsciously that's I'm
one of the best now I have to play
everything and I have to succeed and I
think that's why I started to build
these more forcing environments right

[35:02]
these more forcing environments right
like side bets is the same thing is if I
bet 400k on caches and wcp tournaments
it's just forcing myself to uh to
operate in this environment and and I
think I didn't have the the foresight

[35:15]
think I didn't have the the foresight
yet to say hey maybe I need a break you
know maybe I need something else maybe
let me just kind of see how it goes I I
wasn't I was like pushing hard very very
hard and I think I pushed too much
that's very interesting seems like
somewhere along the way it went from
like internal drives to more of an

[35:31]
like internal drives to more of an
external perception of what's expected
of you obviously you're still driven for
for your own goals it was almost like
this is what I'm expected to do now I'm
at this level and like you said there
wasn't enough reflection at that time to
uh to really figure out what you wanted
to do what the next kind of chapter was

[35:45]
to do what the next kind of chapter was
so yeah I'm ke to pass over to reny now
because he's going to uh dive into your
transition out of Poker then transition
back into poker so over to You Ren to uh
to dive into F's next
stage yeah I want I wanted to I wanted
to touch on a couple things actually
that you guys talked about I thought the

[36:01]
that you guys talked about I thought the
part where I talked to Dan Coleman when
he was on this insane heater uh and it
sounded a bit like you experienced
something different yes of course you
were you know technically a good player
but like how much EV do you think there

[36:17]
but like how much EV do you think there
is in like that sort of Fear Factor I
remember I was talking to Dan he said
well if I open on average people just
fold more because I'm then com and I'm
on a heater and people are like well
let's stay out of this guy's way you
know there's one side yes you're
probably going to be in a very confident

[36:31]
probably going to be in a very confident
stage so you're going to play your A+
game most of the time and because of
your uh because of your image at the
table because of the run that you are
people are going to automatically be in
their SE game like part of it is already
mentally right you're mentioned I think
they already lost in their mind because
they said well there's nothing I can do

[36:46]
they said well there's nothing I can do
because fader is going to win anyway so
there's that part and that part how how
much impact do you think that had on
like your win rate do you think it like
literally doubled just because these
outside
factors I mean

[37:01]
factors I mean
I I I wouldn't say I wouldn't be able to
quantify the the impact but it was it
was massive I I I really do think also
in the Life aspect it was much easier to
figure out where people

[37:18]
figure out where people
are like I I'm thinking uh there's
certain things for example that I think
I can share at some point in time
because they're not valuable anymore but
there were certain reads I have on
people that were so massive and so clear

[37:33]
people that were so massive and so clear
that I had for such a long time that you
could
really I think they had an EV of 10 bb
or more against one particular player
and they were just life based had

[37:46]
and they were just life based had
basically nothing to do with with their
with their game and it's those are guys
I play against all the time so
sometimes uh and now it's much much less
I have
this almost not at all anymore because I

[38:00]
this almost not at all anymore because I
think when you uh back then it it just I
I think people had a certain perspective
but they were also more ignorant to
certain things it's like oh it's not
really possible like this type of
mindset um so especially the ones that
maybe where this isn't their drum suit

[38:15]
maybe where this isn't their drum suit
against those I I I think it can can be
two digit uh two digit win rates you're
just getting from uh either them uh
being in their own head or you seeing
something uh of them that uh they give

[38:31]
something uh of them that uh they give
away yeah the way you described it it
was it was like they were really stuck
in like a victim sort of amount of
victimhood I also think it was really
cool that you said in their perception
of me they felt I was making mistakes
for example you mentioned well according

[38:45]
for example you mentioned well according
to the way they see poker they think
it's right you're playing to lose but in
your perception is well I can play
almost any two cards because I have a
read on you so I'm going to make optimal
decision so actually what you were doing
was way more correct because you
possessed information information that

[39:00]
possessed information information that
they did not understand they figured
like oh opening this hand you know it's
not plus EV but you had multiple sources
of where the EV came from you know the
run the image the fear but also your
reads on theiron did you ever have the
urge or did your ego ever have the urge

[39:16]
urge or did your ego ever have the urge
to say Hey listen you guys all think I
suck but this is actually what's going
on you know I I I sometimes have that
that that that like you want to Almost
Say
eag like listen I'm gonna I'm gonna tell

[39:31]
eag like listen I'm gonna I'm gonna tell
you right now and then then they're like
oh
[ __ ] um I don't think I don't think I
had that that much because certain
people thought I was I I believe at that
time I I thought they thought I was much
better than I thought I was so it was a

[39:46]
better than I thought I was so it was a
bit more the opposite like certain
people you know put me on such a
pedestal like it wasn't all of them of
course right like certain other people
were like oh you know this guy's too
aggressive I was not so good like not it
wasn't like everyone said that but
certain people were like oh this guy is

[40:00]
certain people were like oh this guy is
just you know he's the best like he's
cry and I was like ah you know guys like
hold your horses I'm not sure like I I
also ran pretty good in some so it's
like but then when I try to quantify
things more I do think
that

[40:15]
that
um that there were certain things that
very particular things that just based
on on research and uh actually very
basic math funnily enough it was really
like sometimes I just you know it was
just um I I think I used uh often times

[40:33]
just um I I think I used uh often times
it was really just calculations Excel
sheets and card runnner EV and just like
you know estimating certain things and I
felt like that was actually really big
you know basically this idea of what
like let's just say a very simple thing

[40:45]
like let's just say a very simple thing
like one thing I was very crazy about
was what if I open ace5 off under the
gun for example right like what are what
are all the scenarios that can unfold
where in a game where basically almost
no one flatted right like don't like it
wasn't there was no flatting like you

[41:01]
wasn't there was no flatting like you
know like nobody flatted like under gun
plus two against on gun it was like
let's say 16 big blinds or whatever you
know it was either like you go all in or
you or you fold and then when someone
flatted it was like the one very obvious

[41:15]
flatted it was like the one very obvious
combo you like want to play but so so
oftentimes it was actually you know as
as easy as that is just saying okay if
this guy defends you know 32 % in a big
blind and I get three bet you know this
off my this guy and this off my this guy

[41:30]
off my this guy and this off my this guy
and this off my this guy you're just be
like oh wait a second like this is just
this is just printing so as long as no
one changes their strategy and start
doing you know three betting more or
defending a big BL more or like this is
just massive so I I I worked with a lot

[41:46]
just massive so I I I worked with a lot
of things like this and I felt like PE a
lot of people were didn't take this
exploit like that was the interesting
thing for me you know there were so few
people who started like I didn't get
three but significantly more than like
there were so there were I think a lot
of thought was H you know the guy's to

[42:01]
of thought was H you know the guy's to
lose I'm just going to I'm just going to
get him at some point you know he's he's
gonna he's gonna give it to me and I
think that was like there was a certain
time where I think that was the the
mindset of like you know these are the
charts this is right and I just started
like to deviate 10% above and and um I

[42:16]
like to deviate 10% above and and um I
think it was the correct exploit and I
think like it took one two two and a
half years uh results more people
implementing it and then suddenly I
think way more and the met the meta game

[42:30]
think way more and the met the meta game
switched to like ah actually yeah but e
but even if you know you're like you
look around the table maybe there's a
couple recreationals you're like yeah I
know fader is too lose here but hey is
feder feder is on a run probably I'll
just leave him alone and try to make

[42:45]
just leave him alone and try to make
money of of the guy next to me right but
also I think also because there was
never an explanation really I mean I did
let's say two three videos and one at
once or something but I think it was
very easy for people to give it
different reasons than the reasons I had

[43:03]
different reasons than the reasons I had
it wasn't this like because because you
didn't share these reasons that you're
sharing now of course that they were
only guessing why you would do that and
I guess they were quite close minded
back then like listen the chart says
don't open and you understood more like
where the EV why it's not an open in a

[43:16]
where the EV why it's not an open in a
chart and you were like well maybe the
scenarios that I face are actually
different so it could actually be an
open I mean the charts had no backup
anyway the charts were just some guys
that these are the charts there was no
yeah true true this also people were

[43:30]
yeah true true this also people were
very stuck at like listen this is how
the game is supposed to be played but
based on what I mean it was basically a
good
player like kind of based on experience
just telling you that's the chart that's
it there was nothing there was no there
was no solvers you could like basically

[43:46]
was no solvers you could like basically
what they did
was you work with HRC you go off the
shoving range and then you just kind of
like you know with 10 big blinds you
could say pretty well okay this is kind
of what you're supposed to do so then
okay with 20 big blinds that's kind of
what you're supposed to do but people

[44:00]
what you're supposed to do but people
didn't understand like of course like
nobody kind of knew like because how how
could you you know how how could you
know so uh I think making this more
practical um I think that was uh yeah

[44:17]
practical um I think that was uh yeah
from like 14 to 16 17 I think was a very
big advantage and um and then I think
when solvers came around a lot of the
the things that made it very obviously

[44:30]
the things that made it very obviously
printing um got fixed rather quickly
like with three betting ranges defending
Rangers defending against three bets the
this was like the basically this was my
money-making machine right it was
basically just a first node pre flop and
then post flop it was more like yeah I

[44:45]
then post flop it was more like yeah I
had maybe a good feeling but it was just
also just over
aggression um and I think that was the
that was a money-making machine back
then
yeah I could definitely relate when you
talked about basically your confidence

[45:01]
talked about basically your confidence
increasing when you are analyzing other
players like I think in during the same
period I was playing a lot three
four-handed High six catch games and it
was the same like before I would jump in
a game I would already have five points
that I know like listen this is where my
EV comes from I'm already guaranteed at

[45:16]
EV comes from I'm already guaranteed at
least the winner and then from there you
can just sit down like ah okay well at
least I'm guaranteed a winner because
when I me raise the button the guy's
folding 50% so let's start let's start
by there or like blind vers blind you
know you had like these Five Points like
okay at least I'm a winner that gives
you like a certain ease you know like

[45:31]
you like a certain ease you know like
listen we're settled and from there you
can just flow and play nice poker you
know and and Life's good so I could
really I could strongly relate and then
nowadays when people ask hey how how did
you do it I'm like dude you have to
realize that you know like I said I
could MIM raise but the guy was folding

[45:45]
could MIM raise but the guy was folding
50% yeah what do you want to do right
there were like so obvious leaks that
like it was it was so easy to make money
like the mentality or your approach
towards it can still be the same only
like you said you have to dig a little
bit deeper down the note like the

[46:00]
bit deeper down the note like the
exploits aren't that that easy anymore
right the low hanging fruit people fix
with with solvers because they're the
easiest thing to fix and then the later
the street becomes the more complicated
it is to yeah to to to play correct so I
would say the the Leakes as you also
mentioned bigger pot size later streets

[46:16]
mentioned bigger pot size later streets
that's nowadays when the Leakes are more
present uh compared to like earlier
streets so you you went in retirement it
almost felt like you you explained that
not feeling good about yourself in your
was like okay well if I retire then at

[46:30]
was like okay well if I retire then at
least these feelings will
stop is that was that kind of do am I
getting that
right like did did you go in retirement
to avoid the feelings that you were
feeling right what you mentioned with
your peer group The Envy the yeah this

[46:45]
your peer group The Envy the yeah this
basically this was the if this is if
this is the the best thing that can
happen in my career and this is how I
feel this is not how I want to
feel I wouldn't necessarily neily say to
avoid but it also felt a bit pointless
to repeat something that

[47:01]
to repeat something that
I've that I went through where I didn't
see another option right
like how how would it Go differently in
2017 right if I continue now so I didn't
see this oh let me make this adjustment
and then things you know maybe I so I

[47:16]
and then things you know maybe I so I
didn't see that path I didn't see the
path of P you know sitting down my my
poker group and say guys you know let's
do it differently let's let's you know
take this approach
so I think because I didn't see a path
there where if if I would have seen a

[47:33]
there where if if I would have seen a
path of like hey I feel much better
about playing poker I maybe would have
taken that um but I think that was the
that was the issue I I didn't really see
a path so um I don't think I I wanted to

[47:46]
a path so um I don't think I I wanted to
avoid it but yeah it was clear to me I
didn't want to repeat it and then it was
more okay let me just do something else
I don't see a path there um maybe I get
some different perspective if I pursue a
different

[48:00]
different
path so you then transitioned I believe
more into business investing I'm curious
how did that transition go for you I
know about like Prime mind I know about
poker code but I'm sure you've done more
projects as well which skills do you

[48:15]
projects as well which skills do you
think transitioned very well into the
business and investing space and which
skills I guess you had to learn through
experience prob
you I'm sure you made made a couple of
mistakes here and there that that you

[48:30]
mistakes here and there that that you
learned from I'm very curious to to
learn from that those as
well um I would say I was a newbie
with good potential and way too much

[48:45]
with good potential and way too much
Firepower
so that was really a big issue because
I'm extremely curious and I think my
curiosity it needs to be channeled in
the right environment right and so when

[49:00]
the right environment right and so when
I don't build that environment it's a
bit like kind of the environment that's
just
here if you let's say you know I'm 18
and I get passionate about trading and I
have no money and no means then like my
there's no way for me to like just trade

[49:17]
there's no way for me to like just trade
with something is now was like okay
where does it get channel is like maybe
I apply to like a trading company and
maybe I you know try to learn everything
I can and then during that process you
learn you get more experience you get
better you start trading a bit you get

[49:30]
better you start trading a bit you get
more experience and so on but there it
was now you have to imagine like okay
what if I transition into trading and I
have never done it and it's like this so
I had to
learn
to to set that environment or set that

[49:46]
to to set that environment or set that
frame properly for me for the level of
experience and expertise I'm at in a
totally new area that
is manyfold more complicated or or
complex and has way more factors and way

[50:01]
complex and has way more factors and way
more unknowns than the field of Poker
which is rather defined in comparison
and I was uh way over like way in over
my head so uh was a was a wild ride in
the beginning you you you mentioned in

[50:16]
the beginning you you you mentioned in
the in the questioner that we asked you
to fill out that you like YOLO instead
of planning ahe and you're a gambler at
heart instead of preferring playing safe
I
did do do these characteristic traits
how did they help you and how did they

[50:32]
how did they help you and how did they
prevent you from you know straight away
having the same success as you had in po
I I remember this question probably for
the first one
YOLO maybe isn't the right thing for
both of them it was very close like I

[50:45]
both of them it was very close like I
would say I'm very risk on I I do like
to take risk on things that I believe in
um but I'd say now after about eight
years and spending more time in
entrepreneurship and investing I would
say now in like from year six on I would

[51:01]
say now in like from year six on I would
say year six on I felt like there was a
shift where I was more composed like it
was much easier for me to say no it's
easier for me to to focus and reduce to
the things that matter it's easier for
me to to communicate with others I feel
I have more expertise to um to evaluate

[51:17]
I have more expertise to um to evaluate
things I have a clearer vision for where
to take and and and this feels like like
for me it feels like kind of
um natural now but also if I think about

[51:30]
um natural now but also if I think about
I mean six years is a crazy long time so
in that time it felt more like
overwhelmed all the time like um didn't
really have a clear you know Clear
Vision started things that I realized
later I actually you know that they grow

[51:46]
later I actually you know that they grow
too big or like I'm not able to handle
that responsibility Jugger too many
things at the same time constantly over
my capacity like those were just things
that like happen all the time I really
had to you know I I kind of started
things out of curiosity and excitement
ramped up then realized they kind of

[52:01]
ramped up then realized they kind of
just yeah they naturally evolve and grow
and then like you know it just started
to be too much and then I had to shrink
down and I feel in this shrinking
process of let me you know try to give
something away let me not try to do more
new things let me try to set this up in

[52:16]
new things let me try to set this up in
a good way let me you know learn
something like let me be more clear
communication
let when all those things come together
now I feel I'm more I I very strict with
doing new things um still curious but

[52:31]
doing new things um still curious but
channeling it better um I I feel I'm
much better at uh at at I'm much more
realistic also with products like if I
compare now to back then I feel like
when I look at a product like I'm much

[52:45]
when I look at a product like I'm much
more um you could say critical but just
challenging the things that are you know
someone comes with this great idea like
hey I'm going to build this thing you
know and then it's just going to grow
like this and and and uh for example if
it's in an area I don't have a lot of

[53:00]
it's in an area I don't have a lot of
expertise in there is not even a way for
me to get really excited about the
business because I cannot really
evaluate the business maybe about the
idea or the person but like I separate
this a bit more now as like hey I can't
you know I can't tell you whether that
business is you know has potential or is

[53:15]
business is you know has potential or is
a good idea I could ask people that I
think have a lot of experience or I
could um I could learn more about it
myself um but it sounds very exciting
how EX that you are you know to separate
these things more so I feel there's a
big box of things that happen in those

[53:30]
big box of things that happen in those
eight years and and I feel in a in a
much better place now I guess also try
to be less contagious to the passion and
curiosity of others right they come to
you with this great idea you just come
off like the biggest poker careers of
your life you're like yeah sure why not
invest here invest there you know this

[53:46]
invest here invest there you know this
what you learn in poker right wait we
have good poker players you have high Ro
so if I invest in you invest in you
invest in you then then I make even more
so that's probably the same mentality
you went into investing right people
just caped you like hey I have an
idea it's not only that you know it's

[54:01]
idea it's not only that you know it's
not that you know didn't feel only like
okay you know 15 people came with an
idea to me and I just invested but it's
also um like certain things I really
wanted to be involved and you know I
found really interesting but then it's
also what does it mean to be involved

[54:16]
also what does it mean to be involved
you know to just be more clear on that
like what's my role how much time I'm
going to spend on this how will I feel
about this in three months six months 12
months
all questions were back then it was just
more simple where like hey you know this
I like this energy I really like this

[54:31]
I like this energy I really like this
project I want to work on this I invest
some money I and it wasn't I wouldn't
say um I would I would probably say that
you know a handful of Investments were
just straight up terrible Investments

[54:46]
just straight up terrible Investments
but I wouldn't say the majority of money
I invested I I would say they were okay
not not fantastic maybe but also not
terrible so I also think then there is a
ton of variant and like maybe I would
talk differently now you know if one of
them would have blown up but um but I

[55:02]
them would have blown up but um but I
think really now more it's more I
feel way way better about the absolute
majority of my decisions even if the
outcome is a loss of funds and that I

[55:16]
outcome is a loss of funds and that I
think has changed if I look back there
were a lot more things where I did not
feel great about my decisions along the
way at some point with lots of those
decisions and that's that's different
now I guess it's also easier to become
more outcome oriented when you have less

[55:32]
more outcome oriented when you have less
idea of what your EV was in investment
like in poker if I know you know you're
a good player we have the data to back
it up I know my Roi I make an investment
and I lose it's yeah I made a good
investment but I guess in these other
areas they're like did I actually make a

[55:45]
areas they're like did I actually make a
good investment so I guess if things go
well you know you start to doubt
yourself a bit more than in
poker yeah maybe um
I mean I feel that a big part of it is
is very very random anyway but one one

[56:01]
is very very random anyway but one one
thing I always try to think back of is
how how do you feel about things where
you actually have an idea like if I look
at businesses now where I feel like I
have let's say the highest expertise
let's say someone comes with a poker
site now you know it's like hey I have
this you know idea for a new poker site

[56:15]
this you know idea for a new poker site
let's build it on the blockchain do you
want to invest it's like that's a you
know I have a very different perspective
on this topic and I think mostly it's
just easier to be excited about
something where you have very little
insights because you don't see the

[56:32]
insights because you don't see the
restraints you don't see the issues you
don't see the challenges and um and then
there's two people who don't see those
and then that's
problematic I mean also I think I feel
like in the beginning when you have no

[56:46]
like in the beginning when you have no
expertise you don't really know what you
say yes to right you just say yeah great
idea let's start but like you said you
don't even know what you're actually
going to be doing especially not in one
year two years what's what's what's
actual the thing that you say yes to and
with experience you kind of know what
you're saying yes to I had a very

[57:00]
you're saying yes to I had a very
similar experience when I tried to do
other things outside of Poker in the
beginning you know I'm just excited yeah
yes you say yes yes and then you know
you start and basically you're starting
to dig yourself in and at some point
there's also no way out right it's like
well and you keep on saying yes to
everything and you only get decked

[57:15]
everything and you only get decked
deeper deeper deeper deeper and at some
point like [ __ ] what did I say yes to so
nowadays you know some someone can come
to me with a great idea I'm like mhm but
my mind instead of go with with like the
passion that this person is sharing his
idea with my mind now goes more into
okay what does this actually mean for

[57:30]
okay what does this actually mean for
like my time the activities that I will
be doing so it's way easier to estimate
if this is actually something that I
want to say yes to you mentioned like
areas that you have expertise in I know
you you have poker code did you ever
consider maybe starting your own poker
site you mentioned poker site on the

[57:45]
site you mentioned poker site on the
blockchain fader hols poker I'm sure I'm
sure this IDE has came across across
your path right yeah hell no um I mean
let's I think a big problem is I think
when you run a poker
site uh a really big problem is

[58:03]
site uh a really big problem is
that
you you have a lot of very difficult
decisions and I think that a lot of
people from the outside they don't see
those very difficult

[58:15]
those very difficult
decisions and so um it is also not
really possible to educate people on
these very difficult decisions so now
now it just feels like you're this
lonely Warrior uh trying to build this
thing where

[58:31]
thing where
um you like take Phil galam I think
that's a great example right he did
exactly that like with exactly with that
passion with that Vision that's what he
did side for the poker players yeah yeah
I remember and then where is it you know

[58:47]
I remember and then where is it you know
he's probably that that's actually what
I we we had bring gny on on the previous
podcast he also started pokus I had that
I had actually that question written
down but we didn't get to it like you
know in my head like if Phil gin wasn't
able to do it with the passion that he

[59:01]
able to do it with the passion that he
had for poker the knowledge that he had
poker like I'm not touching that you
know but some people there's always some
people that that that do get into the
space I'm some surprised for example
let's say this is quite quite random but
let's say chewing gum you know sometime

[59:15]
let's say chewing gum you know sometime
tomorrow there might be a guy that's
like I'm gonna enter the chewing gum
Market I'm like why there there's like
what what is your competitive atch right
seems so so difficult it's the same with
the PO side people might you know you
need that certain passion I guess you
also need that
certain ignorance I guess may maybe you

[59:31]
certain ignorance I guess may maybe you
have too much experience now to start a
pokeride you have to be young and no I I
I mean I also think in terms of the
passion you need to have is if I I think
the thing I wanted to say is that the
really difficult challenges in that

[59:46]
really difficult challenges in that
regard are of a let's say a business
nature it's not necessarily a poker
challenge it's like a business challenge
you um you face a lot of very difficult
called um business challenges because if
you want to build poker the biggest

[1:00:02]
you want to build poker the biggest
issue around poker is the limitations
the
regulations and there come lots of very
difficult decisions and and the reason
why uh I wanted to make Phil's example
is because you know extremely high

[1:00:16]
is because you know extremely high
integrity very well funded very capable
guy um I think they built a good product
and and now you have
uh still you know with all these great
starting points you know you it is still

[1:00:31]
starting points you know you it is still
a very challenging
task and um and I think that is that is
a space where it's already a lot of
people competing I think it's not going
to be this thing where everyone's
thriving like I think it's just going to

[1:00:46]
thriving like I think it's just going to
get more and more and more competitive
and you just got to be uh very
competitive and very sharp in in the bit
business sense sense and that's that's
not really where I see myself in this uh
in this area like I don't see myself uh

[1:01:03]
in this area like I don't see myself uh
building a poker site ever
know yeah you like like I said you you
kind of know too much of the of the
problems it it can go wrong too often uh
what I wanted to ask as well do do you

[1:01:16]
what I wanted to ask as well do do you
think it's common because like a lot of
successful poker players you know at
some point they they find themselves in
a similar situation they want to switch
to other things do you think common that
poker players overestimate their skill
transitioning into into other

[1:01:32]
fields or what maybe maybe I should
frame like what what is something they
should be you know with your experience
what something they should be careful
care careful with like what kind of
skills translate well what kind of
skills you noticed maybe I mean I would

[1:01:47]
skills you noticed maybe I mean I would
say the biggest challenge at first is to
switch at all I think the the the
biggest challenge I see in my group of
friends is to actually make a proper
switch and to actually commit to
something I think a lot of them don't
switch because it's kind of a difficult

[1:02:01]
switch because it's kind of a difficult
field to switch out to both status wise
emotional um but also financially just
is this like thing that drags you in we
like oh but I could be making 200k year
poker why should I why should I it's

[1:02:16]
poker why should I why should I it's
it's like e beat trap like on one side
your identity is I'm a poker player so
that's something that you have to let go
of and then the EV trap they every time
compare well but my hour here now is X
and my hour there would be zero maybe if

[1:02:30]
and my hour there would be zero maybe if
they start with something so I feel like
I feel like it's a bit of an EV trap
that keeps players doing just keep on
doing the same thing
just it's what do you mean with that
it's just on the surface I mean it's
never really just the EV trap it's the

[1:02:46]
never really just the EV trap it's the
story you tell yourself that that is the
Trap you on the surface you're stuck in
but actually it's it's always deeper
emotionally around fear of failure or um
like any type of fear around being

[1:03:01]
like any type of fear around being
rejected or like I think it always has
to connect somewhere to some deeper
underlying fear U because the rationale
behind um if you don't invest the time
your poker hourly is going to go like

[1:03:15]
your poker hourly is going to go like
this and like other opportunities are
going to go like this I think that
rational everyone nobody really believes
that poker is a better thing for them
it's just easy to say like oh yeah right
now you know I make more money than this
than this so but that's I mean otherwise

[1:03:31]
than this so but that's I mean otherwise
you wouldn't be in the if you really
like poker and you really want to do
poker then you don't even ask yourself
that question that's actually a very
good point you you one business that did
uh or at least from the outside in
looking did Drive was poker code I

[1:03:46]
looking did Drive was poker code I
believe it started as if I remember
correctly it started as you made a
course with Matias right can you maybe
tell us a little bit about your
experience how that how that business
evolved yeah that's a good uh that's a
good example for business decisions like

[1:04:01]
good example for business decisions like
I I think often times in business you
have to struggle between um just
weighing a lot of different factors and
outcomes and um like I think poker code
is a good mini mini example for this
where I started with a course and the
course sold very well but I wasn't

[1:04:16]
course sold very well but I wasn't
entirely like I I set up with with this
idea there were um quite some courses
out there but I watched a few of them
and I them pretty dry and I felt like
it's not like the people that asked me a
lot about advice didn't I didn't really

[1:04:31]
lot about advice didn't I didn't really
feel like they would sit down now and
watch this um and also didn't like for a
lot of them I think it was too technical
like someone sitting in front of a
solver like just with a webcam and just
like clicking through different hands

[1:04:45]
like clicking through different hands
um and that was at least how I set out
with a mission of just kind of let let's
just break down more complex or
complicated Topics in poker to be just
understood by by anyone whether they're
higher level or or lower level but I

[1:05:01]
higher level or or lower level but I
wasn't I wasn't really happy with the
the result in terms of how people were
you know engaging with it let's say like
this so I think the audience was very
broad I mean I have basically people
from if you take I always take the skill
bar from like I basically have people

[1:05:16]
bar from like I basically have people
from you know one out of 10 to people
nine out of 10 and and I would say the
course now and H side is probably more
geared towards like 3 to
seven and eight and nine out of 10 were

[1:05:30]
seven and eight and nine out of 10 were
like hey you know I was expecting
something else and and uh it it it's
just
um the the way people engage with the
course I was not happy about it at all
so I saw how many people watched and and

[1:05:48]
so I saw how many people watched and and
uh how many videos they watched and I
was just very disappointed I was like
this is not what I thought about it at
all like I don't remember the exact
percentage but I think less than 20%
like actually started watching a
relevant amount of videos and um and

[1:06:01]
relevant amount of videos and um and
paid a crazy right it was like I think
effectively they paid a th Euros or
$1,000 dollar or something for it and
and and then I started to make more
content so I started to make free
webinars and and Matias did some free

[1:06:16]
webinars and and Matias did some free
webinars and there we so are actually we
have to like just kind of guide people a
bit more because a lot of them
especially when you're you know four out
of 10 you're not very structured and you
know don't really know what exactly you
want to do you don't really know where

[1:06:30]
want to do you don't really know where
exactly you want to go so I think that's
when it started to click a bit more
around um what I actually want to do
with it and I think this really has been
more of a a passion project just uh it's
it's never really a business I would

[1:06:46]
it's never really a business I would
have chosen for the uh financial side of
things but um the course would have been
it would have been no effort for me and
just sell the course and that's it but
switching the course into a subscription
model was financially a very bad

[1:07:00]
model was financially a very bad
decision and effort wise a crazy amount
of extra effort uh but nevertheless now
after three years I think now I'm very
happy with where we are because uh now I
feel it's a much much better product
that gives much much more value to the

[1:07:16]
that gives much much more value to the
people using it since it's really more
kind of a year-long
journey and um I'm very happy about the
content we produce um and it's more
geared towards yeah like um not really
like high stakes players but more um

[1:07:31]
like high stakes players but more um
people who are passionate about the game
and want to improve and um know the
rules and um play regularly but can also
be hobby players who just take the game
serious and want to compete or can be
blow a mid-stakes players um so um a

[1:07:46]
blow a mid-stakes players um so um a
pretty broad range but um yeah very
happy about about where we are now but
it took it took a lot of time and um
here we are for for for for the people
listening like oh wait only 20% of
people watch the watch fedo course well

[1:08:01]
people watch the watch fedo course well
must suck blah BL blah this is actually
very normal for for like people buying
people buy stuff like for example also
you mentioned like 1K our coaching
product or other coaching product as
well that even higher priced sometimes
there's just people man they buy it and

[1:08:15]
there's just people man they buy it and
they never even watch it they they don't
they don't even start this happens man
it's it's really weird and like if you
look at the amount of people that
actually completed now in program it's
it's a little bit higher because um we
do indeed just like you said we make
engagements we make live calls every

[1:08:30]
engagements we make live calls every
month stuff like that and also I think
what you've noticed if you make a course
probably when the course was ready is
it's like it's ready but I could go on
for forever right that's like my
experience as well with making course I
remember I was writing everything out
and then the the people that were

[1:08:45]
and then the the people that were
helping were like maybe you should just
produce one third of it already and then
add the rest later that's probably more
beneficial to everyone right and even up
until today I'm like yeah but it's not
really complete I need to add things
here add things there so then you change
the model like like you did subscription
or we add like sort of more interactive

[1:09:01]
or we add like sort of more interactive
coachings monthly or I have a spot where
I can just unleash my creativity and add
extra topics because also with your
experience you you now you have a way
better idea of what your community
actually needs right you went into it
making a course with like well this is

[1:09:15]
making a course with like well this is
probably what people need but then you
came to the conclusion oh wow people
actually struggle with this I kind of
thought that they would know that or I
didn't really realize that this was a
struggle that they had so I think it's
very good that you know it's good to be
flexible and change your business model

[1:09:30]
flexible and change your business model
here and there to kind of help the
people and to have a place where you can
add more content based on new struggles
that arise so I think uh I think you did
a good job there yeah I think the the
number one learning there
is for me what I would take I think very

[1:09:48]
is for me what I would take I think very
very dearly into my into my future and
and whatever I do in the future I think
that value doesn't equate Financial
outcome

[1:10:00]
outcome
so so if I compare what I believe the
value is we deliver to people right
now um it's it must be significant like
both on a subjetive like let's say on an
individual subjective basis if I ask

[1:10:15]
individual subjective basis if I ask
them like hey what do you think you know
this is given you what you think you
know you have got out of this um I would
say that people get sick significantly
weigh more out of it and we make less
money than selling a course and it's
more work so it's basically like you

[1:10:31]
more work so it's basically like you
make less money you have more work and
the only reason is because I I I feel
better about just people having a better
experience and that learning I think is
uh it's actually I think surprisingly

[1:10:46]
uh it's actually I think surprisingly
often the case that you have to make
this tradeoff or have to make this
decision whether you are conscious about
it or not yeah in in in this space you
mean no I think in in business in
general but I think I think it's also

[1:11:00]
general but I think I think it's also
easy to say let's say for example you're
an entrepreneur you broke and you know
then usually uh accumulating finances is
like the the primary objective like
obviously you're already in a good
financial position so I guess it's also
a bit easier to make to make a switch
like that

[1:11:15]
like that
right it is easier to make a switch like
that but I think it's a bit the
difference I I actually encounter this
decision very often in a variety of
different businesses because I think
often we're just not very aware of it um

[1:11:30]
often we're just not very aware of it um
we we're also used to it right as poker
players that's that's just the way our
our brain calculates we think in EV and
that's
it yeah but uh often it also comes down
to ethics right and it comes down to our
own values and it comes down to what we
want and and what we you know how we

[1:11:46]
want and and what we you know how we
perceive the world and how we want to
the where to work so I think this is a
is a very very deep topic actually and
and very uh
often much more than just the
technicalities in the end it's it's
about how you feel about your project

[1:12:01]
about how you feel about your project
right probably if you looked at maybe
only the course you are not feeling as
happy about it is if you look at poker
code now even though like I said like
you said it's financially less rewarding
and it cost you more time but at least
you have something that you're more
proud of and I guess that's more
important than you than yeah getting x%

[1:12:17]
important than you than yeah getting x%
financial gain of just having a course
and it's still and I think that's also a
point that and it still makes money and
I mean why why do I have to Milk The Cow
like it's it's just and it's something
that that that you like working on it

[1:12:31]
that that that you like working on it
probably gives you gives you a lot of
energy as well uh I know also actually
next to Poker coat to make a little jump
uh if I if I understood correct you have
another uh more more small coaching
program like a cfp I believe I saw on

[1:12:45]
program like a cfp I believe I saw on
your Twitter called soon what um what
does working in a CF in a cfp like I
guess a little bit bit more of a smaller
group give you that you don't really
have it poker coat why why did you start
decide to start another group next to

[1:13:00]
decide to start another group next to
Poker coat for coaching that is my
baby um also a good example like I don't
really care about the money I also
wouldn't really call it a cfp it's
interesting I realized now when you said
it technically it is one so um The

[1:13:17]
it technically it is one so um The
Players uh I work with they give a
percentage of their winnings but
it feels for me I mean for it's
definitely it's not like an irrelevant
number for me it feels more symbolism so

[1:13:30]
number for me it feels more symbolism so
for me it's really more that that that
kind of manages the balance in a way
like I I think if it would be free it
just brings a totally different Dynamic
than if they because I want them from
their perspective to also say is this
worth it for me you know is this worth

[1:13:46]
worth it for me you know is this worth
my time is this worth my money um and I
think it just kind of connects things
more and binds it more together but uh I
have I basically started where there's a
few people I started working with that
really more just supporting them because

[1:14:01]
really more just supporting them because
I I they were already playing mid high
stakes um I think one of them you know
feo
and um the other one his name is Curtis
nighter or Saul D online but they played

[1:14:17]
nighter or Saul D online but they played
tournaments so I think they they both
watched your watch your content um at
least they they told me told me about
you and um and they're both

[1:14:31]
like how do I describe that
better I I
see um or I saw the reason we started
was I just was very impressed by how
they work and and how they approach

[1:14:46]
they work and and how they approach
poker and it felt at this point where
you know they are surpassing me and I
and that was just a really nice feeling
of seeing that there is you know people
who are um who are in a position where
they're trying to make it and I can have

[1:15:00]
they're trying to make it and I can have
a positive impact on their Journey so I
just started to um support them here and
there and we started working a bit
closer together and then I also have uh
a few poker friends that are just
overall friends like Mario mosberg for

[1:15:15]
overall friends like Mario mosberg for
example um or Vu TM or um Rand Rita or
DD fast like there's a few few guys I I
work with and um I just did a group out
of that to just talk about poker and and

[1:15:32]
of that to just talk about poker and and
discuss and so Curtis and Manu I worked
a bit closer with and then
um I did grind House 3 about one and a
half years ago where I basically I rent
a house I for one and a half weeks and I

[1:15:47]
a house I for one and a half weeks and I
uh people apply and I coach them for for
a week um and we just spent basically
the whole time together and those are
mid-stakes players and out of those
there were a few guys that I knew from

[1:16:01]
there were a few guys that I knew from
before and I just had a really good
feeling when when we were there and that
was basically the the start of of soon
because I I felt like oh these guys I
can help a lot like they're now actually
where I can shape the trajectory of the

[1:16:15]
where I can shape the trajectory of the
career Without Really poker coaching to
be honest like for me it was really more
about poker will help but is really more
about how do you what's your trajectory
how do you how do you map out how do you
envision your career and and how do you

[1:16:30]
envision your career and and how do you
pursue this and um yeah that was the
start that's about 14 months ago now and
we are 10 people
now and I think it's
a like I think at least five of those

[1:16:46]
a like I think at least five of those
are I'm just going to absolutely murder
High six tournament so I'm going to I'm
super ex like for me it's like I feel
like a father you know I feel like I'm
so proud of them it's it's
incredible yeah you have a lot of
experienced uh coaching players maybe

[1:17:01]
experienced uh coaching players maybe
also to give like some poins to some of
the listeners what do you think are like
very common mistakes and leaks that
players have like that that you
encounter that kind of stops them from
reaching higher higher levels of
success yeah I feel it's always the same

[1:17:15]
success yeah I feel it's always the same
but always
different um like the number one thing
we we had really big struggles the first
nine months would
say and you mentioned it before is this
when you expect something that you
didn't even realize you expect because

[1:17:30]
didn't even realize you expect because
you thought it's so
clear and and I think that shows like
when you have an understanding of let's
say let's say we have an understanding
of playing high stakes and then we
reverse that into okay Rene you have an

[1:17:46]
reverse that into okay Rene you have an
understanding of playing High sticks I
have an understanding of playing High
sticks and then we describe a person we
believe
belongs onto High s and how does that
person work or what you know what's his
routine what what are his

[1:18:01]
routine what what are his
characteristics and uh and then you
compare to someone who's playing midak
and you're
like what is that person
doing and then when when they say I wna

[1:18:15]
doing and then when when they say I wna
I want to be the best you know I want to
play on high
stick then you're assuming that they
have that understanding
too because that's what I assumed is
like okay you know do you know what that

[1:18:30]
like okay you know do you know what that
means do do you know what it means to be
one of the best you know do you do you
know what it means how how to work how
much time like how how much
professionalism you have to show how
effective you have to work um and and

[1:18:46]
effective you have to work um and and
what you have to bring to the table and
I think that's where the first
discrepancy starts is expectation and
expectation management it's a very loose
sentence to throw around to I want to be
great you know I want to be the best I
want to I want to play highes it's a

[1:19:01]
want to I want to play highes it's a
very loose
sentence but when you talk when you look
at actions and when you look at what
people are actually doing I would say
that is the biggest struggle is actions
don't match the words so they basically
you confront them with

[1:19:17]
you confront them with
this I confront them with this
often um a common what is a common
response that that you get what's like
the first the first level of resistance
sentence that they throw at you
afterward there not really

[1:19:31]
afterward there not really
resistance there's some resistance but
there's not really resistance I think uh
because they they're
probably they take what I say pretty
serious so I think that is a very good
starting point but

[1:19:45]
starting point but
it's it's
um like
let I I think a big a really big point
is let's say you stand there right you
look at
something and I stand on the other side

[1:20:01]
something and I stand on the other side
or maybe even I stand on top and I see a
bit more and now the thing in the middle
let's say is working in a group or
having a group of people to work with or
exchange and now that person is looking
at that idea that concept and is like

[1:20:15]
at that idea that concept and is like
evaluating this idea is like yeah you
know working in a group is I have a few
buddies if I grind Sunday I post a hand
in there maybe they give some response
there's some value so they evaluate this
thing from this perspective I evaluate
it from this perspective and saying okay
if you work in a group and you're eight

[1:20:30]
if you work in a group and you're eight
people and eight people prepare content
and every person puts in three hours
into 30 minutes of content you have four
hours of content you share that content
within three hours of work you have uh
you you get three hours and 30 minutes
of other content of people who have put

[1:20:45]
of other content of people who have put
their time in there so three hours of
input and higher density of content you
know now like now suddenly if you do
this as a routine uh if I put in just
you know this amount of time if I take
this very seriously I can swap with
those guys I can study with those guys I

[1:21:01]
those guys I can study with those guys I
can dve with those guys I can learn with
them I can travel with them life book is
gonna be so basically I see this whole
package of like a group is probably one
of the most meaningful and most valuable
things you can have in poker if you find
people who are just you know willing to
commit and and can produce high quality

[1:21:16]
commit and and can produce high quality
output and they look at every we're like
H you know group is like you know it's
nice nice to have some people to chat
with but not really so you already have
such a big clash in the understanding of
what the value is so they're not willing

[1:21:32]
what the value is so they're not willing
to nobody nobody is like why should I
why should I you know proactively spend
four hours to prepare something because
it's not clear to you that everyone's
doing that right it's not this clear
thing where like yeah if I do that

[1:21:46]
thing where like yeah if I do that
because it's not a clear reaction you
you might do it nobody else does
something you're like why did I do that
so it's also I I guess their definition
right you say do you work do you work
with other players they say yes but work
with other players your definition of
work with other players you just

[1:22:00]
work with other players you just
described whereas their work with other
players is yeah I shared a hand history
on Sunday you know after I played this
tournament yeah or you know a lose
review or like and they work with
players that are you know much worse
than them and there's not really a
strong ethic and it's like very loose

[1:22:15]
strong ethic and it's like very loose
and you just hang out after grind and
like you know kind of this like a social
it's more a social event right it's more
like a social thing which is also
totally fine and and I think those
things are important too but I think in
terms of again if you if you're in this
mode of hey I want to be one of the best

[1:22:30]
mode of hey I want to be one of the best
you just uh you got to increase the
intensity of output to a degree where
you progress significantly faster than
other people in your in your competition
group and um I think we are at a point
now and that's why I'm very excited
because if I open this chord you know if

[1:22:45]
because if I open this chord you know if
I compare now now it feels more like
breathing to them where there's like you
know there's like it like even this week
you know there's just constantly stuff
today now and like one hour there's a
session like everyone's joining like

[1:23:00]
session like everyone's joining like
people are chatting all the time like
then different time zones someone does a
study session at 2 am someone else is
joining it's just like it just feels
like vibrant and something's happening
all the time and when you have that then
it's at that point it's like you
wouldn't even know you would never want

[1:23:15]
wouldn't even know you would never want
to go back so um I mean it's also I
think it's a good good actually pointer
for people listening to this pod I'm
sure there's many people that maybe
listened to all our episodes and they
probably like maybe have a check this
yeah I do that I do that but what does

[1:23:30]
yeah I do that I do that but what does
it actually mean they were like yeah
well I work with people yeah I do this I
do that but it's the quality with which
you do it that's going to determine the
outcome I think another very common
thing that I hear when you say oh well
you want to work get to high stakes then
you have to do this this and this and
then they say yeah but that's not

[1:23:46]
then they say yeah but that's not
necessary at my Stakes you know because
I'm playing low stakes or mid Stakes but
like but if you're not doing it now you
will also not do it later and the fact
that you're not doing it now means that
you're not getting to the high stakes
right so I think it's always a good
reflection that let's say for example

[1:24:00]
reflection that let's say for example
someone listening playing make lower
stakes and mid Stakes how would you
structure your week or how would you
prepare for a session if tomorrow you
would have to play against Fedor for
example and they might say like oh wow
no yeah if I play against fed tomorrow
you know then I might skip that
hamburger tonight you know I might eat
something healthy or I might do go to

[1:24:16]
something healthy or I might do go to
the gym you know because I want to feel
sharp well approach tomorrow like you
would play against fader that would be
that would I think be my advice you did
yeah go ahead yeah you because you asked
around I I mentioned one big thing I

[1:24:32]
around I I mentioned one big thing I
seeing people struggling or is is this
mismatch of actions and expectations and
I I would say that's probably the major
point because generally I would
say

[1:24:45]
say
uh people want to be successful for a
variety of different
reasons but in poker I believe
you need
to as intrinsically as possible just
want it more than the majority of things

[1:25:00]
want it more than the majority of things
in your life otherwise I would say it's
almost
impossible like I always make this
example I think it is very very very
important that you don't force
this because I've also worked with

[1:25:15]
this because I've also worked with
players who have lots of interest for
example
they love they have a variety of
different
hobbies and poker is one of those you
know like let's say out of the five
hobbies that they very you know they

[1:25:30]
hobbies that they very you know they
love biking they they they love uh
skydiving they they do this regular you
know like even like let's say they they
travel to do this and like and and and
then they love poker as well but you
know and you also have you have a
girlfriend and you have a strong Social

[1:25:45]
girlfriend and you have a strong Social
Circle and like lots of friends outside
you went to UNI and you you know like
your family's in Germany you also love
to visit visit your family and and then
I see poker more as a lifestyle
facilitator and that for me I don't I

[1:26:02]
facilitator and that for me I don't I
think you there's always something
negative connected with this because
there's always this element you know
it's just kind of like it's not the the
the whole deal like you don't try to
make I think that is such a great thing

[1:26:15]
make I think that is such a great thing
to use poker for like I think poker is
such a great thing to do 30 hours a week
or like 25 a week I think it's a great
thing now you can make 100K a year no
problem um you will never play tritons

[1:26:32]
problem um you will never play tritons
probably and you will probably never
play high stakes and you probably never
will make
250k but for you know five years it's a
great great thing to do especially if
you like it you can travel to a few

[1:26:46]
you like it you can travel to a few
places you know it it can be mentally
very challenging you can develop in
certain things and it just has to be
clear you got to move on at some point
and and um and also it's got to be clear
it's just never the full on thing but

[1:27:01]
it's just never the full on thing but
but I think that is a very important
realization that a lot of prayers
struggle with because it's very hard to
to accept that with yourself as like hey
you know this is this is kind of a My
Lifestyle profession then then then they
kind of never

[1:27:15]
kind of never
feel never feel satisfied I guess
because then they do spend the things in
their Hobbies then then they maybe feel
guilty ah but I should try to become
this great poker player and if they
would then kill all their hobbies and
focus on poker they also feel miserable
so it's very important I think what
you're pointing out is that you kind of

[1:27:31]
you're pointing out is that you kind of
know what's important to you and where
does poker fit in so is indeed poker
just a facilitator for the other things
that ort to you then that's great but
it's a problem when you do the other
things and you kind of feel guilty that
you should spend time on poker and
unfortunately I mean the reality of

[1:27:46]
unfortunately I mean the reality of
Poker is you're competing as other guys
and there's someone there you know
spending 24/7 on poker you know it's
very likely that he he is going to
outperform you actually another point
that I wanted to add you know like the
way you describe that you approach
sessions right some some players might

[1:28:01]
sessions right some some players might
listen or I guess the majority might
listen but like oh well but that's not
normal and they would look around well
you don't do that you don't do that well
if you do the thing you know that's
normal quote quote you will get the
results that's normal quote quote aka
the results of the majority and the
majority is not a high six poker player

[1:28:16]
majority is not a high six poker player
right so maybe you know doing things
different is probably a good idea if you
want to have different results than the
majority yes but then also it's not that
hard I also really I always try to say

[1:28:31]
hard I also really I always try to say
that because I understand like you have
to put a lot of effort into lining
yourself up let's say it like this like
to just get in a good routine but then
the actual doing I think is surprisingly
easy it is when it becomes normal right
because you don't think differently yeah

[1:28:46]
because you don't think differently yeah
but also just the the tasks at hand I
think are not as challenging as in other
areas for example I think it is often
rather rewarding tasks um
pretty pretty action based or pretty

[1:29:00]
pretty pretty action based or pretty
outcome based where something you learn
almost immediately helps you something
for what you're
doing um it's very practical like I
think people often forget that that it's
just actually a very very nice way to to

[1:29:16]
just actually a very very nice way to to
learn and practice something it's like I
I would say if you work let's say 15
hours on your game or 20 hours hour on
your game a week you're outperforming
the absolute vast majority and if you
put in those you know
like rather smart you know with like a

[1:29:30]
like rather smart you know with like a
high drive to improve the processes and
improve your learning process and find
good routines for yourself with a high
level of practical drilling rather fit
to to um to practical outcomes in in
your actual gameplay you'll make great

[1:29:45]
your actual gameplay you'll make great
strides of progress and it's not an it's
not an absurd amount of of time effort
um
but I think to get to that point
oftentimes people struggle a lot so
uh so yeah you need the right uh the

[1:30:00]
uh so yeah you need the right uh the
right

further Ado let's get back into more

[1:32:01]
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's
episode I wanted to uh ask you about 20
I think it was 2020 when you sort of
made your come comeback I mean you never
completely retired but you know when you

[1:32:15]
completely retired but you know when you
really wanted to dedicate yourself to
Poker
again what was different because I
remember you said that you quit because
you already reached the high success and
this is what it felt like and yeah going
forward was just a repeat of the same

[1:32:30]
forward was just a repeat of the same
and you weren't feeling that
great what did you change in your
approach coming in to make sure it
wasn't a repeat of your previous
experience um I mean it was rather
clearly uh circumstances of

[1:32:47]
clearly uh circumstances of
Corona so covid I was sitting at home
and games were
incredible and then the mixture of that
it was really that was really it and

[1:33:01]
it was really that was really it and
then my my partnership with G kind of
all it all came at the same time and
then I just was there and I was like oh
this is really exciting like high six
tournaments regularly I don't know that
one so uh I started playing 2ks 5Ks 10ks

[1:33:19]
one so uh I started playing 2ks 5Ks 10ks
there was one you know they were running
every day and I was just firing up I
think I had 50k buyin every day and I
was just like okay let's go this is
fun how did you how did the

[1:33:31]
fun how did you how did the
games change I mean you were never
completely out of it but I can imagine
that especially Sun these high six
tournaments on a regular basis you face
different opposition what were some of
the things that you noticed coming back
that people were doing differently and

[1:33:45]
that people were doing differently and
what were maybe some of the things that
you had trouble with that you had to
adapt your game a bit um so the first
thing that was very I was very cautious
I really went in there my idea was okay
I didn't really play poker for three
years these guys probably are on a

[1:34:01]
years these guys probably are on a
different different Universe now like
different different level these online
kids pass you know surpass me I'm just
just kind of see if I can hang in there
and then I played and I played and I
played and I was like wait wait a second

[1:34:16]
played and I was like wait wait a second
like some of these guys still play
terrible and and I think it was this mix
of
what felt
like you know a bit of a bit of this Gap
where some people I felt like were
really good you know like much much

[1:34:32]
really good you know like much much
better than when I used and I really
felt like I could pick a pool of 25
people I felt like wow these guys just
made big big progress what did they do
that make you that that made them stand
out to you like did they put you in

[1:34:45]
out to you like did they put you in
tough spots that you would normally not
get in or just much cleaner overall game
especially you know you have to you have
to see my my game back then again was
very was very
simple like coup tricks like I really

[1:35:01]
simple like coup tricks like I really
like my game in general like I think I'm
a you know I'm a smart guy but not I'm
not a genius so it was really more
pattern
recognition and let's say it was more I
had

[1:35:15]
had
a let's say 15 tricks right it was quite
quite a lot of them were pre flop
and then it's stuff like uh check
raising was back then a big a big
printing spot in basically almost all
nodes um raising in position like in

[1:35:31]
nodes um raising in position like in
certain type of spots um and then for
example stabbing and basically all kinds
of spots and certain
sizing um like basically that was it
right those was my then obviously there

[1:35:45]
right those was my then obviously there
were spots where I'm thinking and like
where maybe sometimes I'm calling over
calling or under calling like for
example certain betting patterns like
very simple right if they like if they
if it goes big big big it's much much
more likely to be a strong hand if it
goes like small big small it's much more

[1:36:02]
goes like small big small it's much more
likely to be as a weekend like these
type of things where ah okay so so my
game was actually more based on just
like a few things that were just making
money and then like kind of thinking in
between and now I felt like there were

[1:36:15]
between and now I felt like there were
certain players where they cleaned up
their preflop game they um they defended
correctly they found the right three
betting frequencies they um they played
much better C betting strategies um they
found the correct check raising

[1:36:30]
found the correct check raising
frequencies they you know found three
bets against check raises they defended
correctly against check ra you know no
Suddenly It's like a lot of these very
immediate they found check raises as an
open razor against an imposition flat

[1:36:45]
open razor against an imposition flat
you know stuff like this where this was
all the spots where you could just like
oh you know just see that 80% against uh
against an open Raise imposition because
everyone's just check folding 60% 70% 75
80 um
so it's just pretty pretty simple game

[1:37:02]
so it's just pretty pretty simple game
but when you now suddenly have to
actually yourself you know play a bit
cleaner game now you're forced into
developing and I think that's what I
encountered there is like um there was a
pool of 20 30 players where I'd say wow

[1:37:15]
pool of 20 30 players where I'd say wow
they they made big progress they're very
strong they cleaned up like let's say
the first you know the the major nodes
up until the Flop or or up until the
turn so after the Flop and then uh turn
was wild west but uh before that it felt

[1:37:31]
was wild west but uh before that it felt
like they're pretty strong and then the
rest really felt like uh still a lot of
people just didn't really know what's
going on so the the fields felt pretty
pretty weak how did you then go about um
upping your game to maybe match their

[1:37:46]
upping your game to maybe match their
level and try to go surpass them and how
did that look different than Maybe how
you would approach it back in 2013
2014 I mean just working way more with
solvers I think that's the the very
simple answer is uh just really trying

[1:38:01]
simple answer is uh just really trying
to clean up my game because that's
that's the hardest thing that's that's
the thing where um I think I could
only
um make big strides now if I actually
spend tons and tons of hours uh in

[1:38:18]
spend tons and tons of hours uh in
Practical drilling because there's so
many things that I I realiz this all the
time there's so many things that are
exploits that are so
practically fixed in my game that I need

[1:38:31]
practically fixed in my game that I need
to like get R because it's like also
when you play lots of tables it's just
like oh you know this is you just I'm
just so used to this playing hundreds of
thousands of hands with this kind of as
the default that I have to unwind the
default establish a new default and

[1:38:47]
default establish a new default and
understand that this is an exploit I
still can use but against way less of
the the population than it used to where
before it just used to be a 98% exploit
now it's like a 60% exploit and that's a
massive difference because against 98

[1:39:01]
massive difference because against 98
you don't care if the 2% you just do it
anyway and against 60 you you lose money
if you do it against everyone so I I
think that that is probably the hardest
uh so I had to clean up my game in in
tons of nodes where I was just overly

[1:39:15]
tons of nodes where I was just overly
aggressive where now the meta game
shifted more into people just being
super stick
so uh it's a whole different whole
different
game does that discourage you or is this
the type of composition competition that

[1:39:31]
the type of composition competition that
kind of fires you to put in the extra
hours uh it encourages me but the thing
that's a bit unfortunate is it's less
fun I think there's certain things to
make uh chips that are more fun than
others right um it's just not really

[1:39:47]
others right um it's just not really
let's say you play against a fish who's
just way too aggressive or way too C and
basically all lines it's just not really
fun because what you do is you wait for
good hands and you just get all the
money um so that's a bit how it

[1:40:01]
money um so that's a bit how it
feels um it is fun to find thin value
bets I think because that is really you
really need to use your brain to
structure your Rines in a way where you
can end up with uh more hands to bet for

[1:40:15]
can end up with uh more hands to bet for
Value in spots where people end up
polarized and
overall um but it's also very chall in
much more challenging than uh than just
putting on random aggression and um the
part where when I feel like people

[1:40:31]
part where when I feel like people
overcall me and I just have to reduce
bluffing
frequencies that's pretty that's pretty
boring like I enjoy this much less than
uh people over folding and and putting
because you just win more pots right
it's no yeah yeah I I get it right you

[1:40:45]
it's no yeah yeah I I get it right you
you you win more pot so yeah you're more
satisfied so it sounds like deviations
from the solver I guess you you can take
more pride in it yourself like ah I
could now just follow Theory you know
and then make money by me just playing
solidly but you take less ownership but

[1:41:00]
solidly but you take less ownership but
when you deviate from the solver like a
Tim Val betat and he calls you with a
hand that he shouldn't be calling that's
the moment where you're like you know
yeah I like the spraying versus spraying
um activity so when when that shows

[1:41:15]
um activity so when when that shows
results I that that feels very uh very
fulfilling so could you maybe clarify
because actually I saw that I wanted to
touch on this as well I saw in a in a
recent tweet of yours where you
mentioned um cherishing poker in is Pur
form mind versus mind and now you
mention brain versus brain yeah I mean

[1:41:32]
mention brain versus brain yeah I mean
we did talk on some topics and you I
think you kind of said like that is
brain versus brain but maybe I didn't
really follow what is brain versus brain
com and how is that different than for
example using Huds MDA solver

[1:41:45]
example using Huds MDA solver
strategies I
mean like the reason why why I say say
that because I think it's
um let's say if you give someone a chart
it just becomes a technical execution
right like if if he has the chart open

[1:42:02]
right like if if he has the chart open
at that point it's not even a memory
task if right like one thing is if
someone looks at a chart is like you
have toor screw
upot yeah and and I think that takes
away like it's for me poker is not
really about technical execution like

[1:42:16]
really about technical execution like
who who clicks who makes less mistakes
look at a chart and clicking that that
for me is not really the the nature of
the game and how I got to know it and
also how I cherish it um so that for me
should not exist like I think there

[1:42:30]
should not exist like I think there
should for me nothing where you look at
something and then just have to execute
that um that's the first part but then I
mean kind of the reduced part of that is
I just
think um

[1:42:45]
think um
like G gaining advantages that
that uh
where there's not a clear line what is
ethical and what is not or at least like
there's maybe a consensus of what what
is ethical and then a lot of people

[1:43:00]
is ethical and then a lot of people
don't do that I think that's also I
personally consider that cheating and
um and some things are not as defined
right like it's very difficult to say
what it because the word is defined but

[1:43:16]
what it because the word is defined but
where does it start and and where does
it end or what is it and what is it not
right yeah there will always be gray
space right so if I if I like my
personal opinion is if I analyze my
database that for me is okay so even if

[1:43:33]
database that for me is okay so even if
I help you analyze your database also
that for me would be okay so if you come
to me and you're like hey feder you know
I played 300,000 hands can you help me
uh find advantages against these players
I'm playing
against that for me is but if you if you

[1:43:47]
against that for me is but if you if you
have a Hut and then you know you took
notes and you uh it shows you you know
on every line you're playing like it it
shows you the thing that you prep like
that for me already is not something
that I would I would want I think Huds
in general are I personally think uh

[1:44:02]
in general are I personally think uh
simple Huds I think are fine but
anything Advanced I think should uh
rather not be part of the game in my
opinion I also believe that things
should be
enforced and uh now I'm more trying to
abstractly Define where I personally

[1:44:16]
abstractly Define where I personally
draw a line and that that doesn't
necessarily represent like what the
security measures of GG are now since
since my new role but um I I think en
forcibly it's probably the best to not
allow huts and then have some type of

[1:44:31]
allow huts and then have some type of
information built in the site I
personally think that is the easiest and
and smoothest solution um but in general
kind of what GG already does right you
have a h available with like basic stats
yeah and then can be discussed what
exactly should be there and so on and

[1:44:46]
exactly should be there and so on and
also in terms of checking your own
results I I really try to I think we
should focus Less on problems and things
that don't work well and really more on
how can we like there's certain things
that people push for that people want or
you know that are Ben official in some
way but I think often they come with

[1:45:01]
way but I think often they come with
things that are not really great um and
and I think we should focus on how can
we achieve the good things without the
bad things and I mean if the solution
was simple you know then we all would
agree and all sides would do the same
thing right so like in my opinion for

[1:45:16]
thing right so like in my opinion for
example um actually I think like H's
data they I think they actually kind of
cherish the Mind versus mind aspect of
Poker because I feel like if you work
for example if you would remove Huds and
have no information you're kind of
forced to fall back on playing solver

[1:45:31]
forced to fall back on playing solver
strategies like oh I'm I don't know who
these people are I don't know how they
play so what I'll do is I'll F fall back
on solver approved you know Baseline
strategies and then I'll execute for me
that kind of for example Anonymous games
I don't like I want to know who I'm up
against right do you do you maybe agree

[1:45:46]
against right do you do you maybe agree
with like Anonymous games being being
being not not the way forward because it
kind of forces that type of thing yeah I
really don't like Anonymous games for
multiple reasons um I think again in

[1:46:00]
multiple reasons um I think again in
terms of the player versus player
Dynamic I believe that takes something
away but also I think in terms of um
like the the fun of the game I think it
takes something away but also I think in
terms of security I think it makes
things uh much more complicated if you

[1:46:15]
things uh much more complicated if you
have Anonymous accounts I think it also
Spurs like this feeling of I don't know
who I'm playing against and um I think
it just makes it a bit more
um comfortable and personal if you know
if you know who you're up against um but

[1:46:30]
if you know who you're up against um but
back maybe to the topic of um of data
like I I think the the real problem
right and and I think that's what I also
want to focus on because if we if we try
to find like solutions that just address

[1:46:45]
to find like solutions that just address
everything you know in a like extremely
long term then then we miss out on the
things that in the short term are
problematic and that's what I try to
focus on as well uh is
to we should have these discussions
about the general topics and the

[1:47:02]
about the general topics and the
long-term Solutions but also about the
short-term Solutions and I think in in
terms of MDA and billions of hands being
used for data analysis I think the main
use case right now I would say is very
clearly net negative and very predatory

[1:47:17]
clearly net negative and very predatory
so the two main use cases I would say is
a on the one side um is that Stables um
and and I know particular ones who who
utilize that is that they just teach

[1:47:31]
utilize that is that they just teach
hundreds of players um on Mid Stakes
certain strategies and they just slave
away and click these type of strategies
and I think that's just very bad for the
economy of the game and a lot of them
have been removed already but still a
lot of them uh are playing because it's

[1:47:46]
lot of them uh are playing because it's
just very hard right to to uh you can
see certain strategies and I can
probably say okay there's a high
likelihood that's based on on MDA
analysis this type of group has done but
you haven't found the guy using a

[1:48:01]
you haven't found the guy using a
certain chart or like you have you know
you haven't caught so it's like already
there it begins right like based on what
do you want to exclude people and that's
when it becomes a really complicated
topic um because what is what is okay
and what's not okay but um I think in

[1:48:15]
and what's not okay but um I think in
terms of the the impact on the ecosystem
there I'm pretty firm that I don't think
that a good thing for the ecosystem I'm
not sure if
other like like like would you agree
like let's say for example if I would
come up with my strategy you know and I
start executing it it's not really a

[1:48:30]
start executing it it's not really a
problem but then when I when I when I
teach like 200 quotequote slaves of me
do this do this in every line and I put
200 accounts in the game then it becomes
a
problem I I believe so yeah no that that
that that I think makes sense but it

[1:48:45]
that that I think makes sense but it
doesn't really take because I for
example I do actually uh
um I do think actually the the whole
data approach it does definitely trigger
my curiosity coming up with strategy and
stuff I find that's very very cool but I
agree that it has this downside and that

[1:49:00]
agree that it has this downside and that
it's probably not good for the ecosystem
if we then put 200 quotequote robots in
the games right but there's a bit mod
trade right because let's say even on
your
level um I think also there's a very big
difference if you let's say you have

[1:49:17]
difference if you let's say you have
five opponents or 10 opponents you play
against all the time
I think there's a very big difference
whether um you have all hands this guy
has played the entire last year or
whether you have only the hands you have

[1:49:30]
whether you have only the hands you have
played no yeah I agree because the hands
you have played he also
has and I think that is like that for me
is the easiest way to just have a Level
Playing Field because that to me seems

[1:49:45]
Playing Field because that to me seems
like the logical thing of you have the
hands you have played he has the hands
he has played and and uh there was this
example being made that it's just like
other sports teams where you know you
can watch other games basically and then
you can see the results of other games I

[1:50:00]
you can see the results of other games I
see it a bit more like flying a drone
over uh over the training ground of
another team without him knowing right
like or having a spy in like that and
and this stuff has happened in the NFL
and NBA and NHL and like people and and

[1:50:18]
and NBA and NHL and like people and and
that's how I see it a bit more right so
I think it's more like in poker I see
the equivalent more as the information
that you should have access to is the
games you have played and then if you if
you watch someone else playing for me

[1:50:31]
you watch someone else playing for me
that's also fine you know you're not
going to be able to watch a million
hours of this guy playing but if you no
that makes sense you for for the people
maybe also tuning in like what fader is
referring to he was uh I think a couple
days ago right that you were uh you took

[1:50:45]
days ago right that you were uh you took
a position at GG at the security team uh
this is also I guess one of the reason
why why you brought up like uh the the
whole MDA question I think the the
original idea of the sites is indeed
like it's okay that you get these hands
right that that you play against people

[1:51:00]
right that that you play against people
that's generally I think most sites
would agree with that that's okay but
then the problem in the exists is if I
have suddenly have like 100,000 hands on
a guy that have that I've only played
5,000 hands with for example but then
the biggest problem is I guess in the

[1:51:15]
the biggest problem is I guess in the
reinforcement um yeah in the
reinforcement area because you know that
there's very likelihood that he has that
100,000 hands on you so are you going to
be the one playing that you don't have
that advantage while you think it's very
likely that your opponent does use that
advantage on you and then it becomes a

[1:51:30]
advantage on you and then it becomes a
game of like ah yeah listen I don't want
to be the one having the disadvantage so
then just everyone starts to use it and
then it becomes like quotequote level
player field but obviously it's only the
people who have access to this
information because it's not like as
easy as for example a GTO wizard to get
access to this type of information but

[1:51:47]
access to this type of information but
then using that information is actually
a skill like I can give someone the
information and someone else the
information but what they're going to do
with the information is not going to be
the same correct like and that's why I
think in in that regard um analysis of

[1:52:03]
think in in that regard um analysis of
data for me is do anything you want like
in your own you know in your chamber you
like with the data it's really more
about what data is available and what's
not and I'm personally pretty strong
against mind mind data of sites I think

[1:52:16]
against mind mind data of sites I think
it's just not a just not a good thing
for the EOS
and I think the the only kind of really
short-term argument I believe that is
being made is around detection of

[1:52:30]
being made is around detection of
cheaters um but I think that argument is
quite inflated in general like in in
some cases it's definitely true but in a
bigger scheme of things it's a very very
minor part of um security and it should

[1:52:45]
minor part of um security and it should
be and I think that's really more the
thing to address is that security should
be much better at detecting um these
more generic things that to detect um
because the subjective the subjective
stuff you can still right like if you
feel like you play against someone and

[1:53:00]
feel like you play against someone and
just feels weird you can still uh you
can still report things but the actual
data analysis on on mass scale for like
Bing or RTA and Analysis of or just the
general Ecology of the games and and
where things are um where there's maybe

[1:53:17]
where things are um where there's maybe
suspicious things happening um
I there's a lot of stuff happening
already but I think that quality has to
improve and and um yeah that's what I
what I'm spending my my time on in that
new world is that one of your

[1:53:30]
new world is that one of your
motivations also going into the security
security like because I feel like
players nowadays they feel like they
have to police the games ourselves or
the poker Community Players they feel
like they have to police the games
yourself because they have very little
trust in the security of like for

[1:53:45]
trust in the security of like for
example certain poker site is that one
of the motivations that you decide to
take on this role I mean there's not
many other possible motivations I mean
people will suspect uh Financial
motivations but I can tell you they're
not very not very meaningful
differentiator for for for this role

[1:54:03]
differentiator for for for this role
um I do believe that that's the best
possible impact I can have at the
company and that's the reason why I why
I wanted to do that as well so it wasn't

[1:54:17]
I wanted to do that as well so it wasn't
I wasn't forced in this position and
uh for me it's really more that's also
always behind the scenes uh the topic I
spent most of my time on before so
giving advice on certain topics but now
it's actually like constantly discussing

[1:54:31]
it's actually like constantly discussing
with the head of security and like being
involved more in cases and and I think
the biggest part is also relaying
certain information and pushing for
certain topics such as um you know if
they're because especially uh in high
six communities those things are rather

[1:54:46]
six communities those things are rather
transparent and and they're monitoring
the game games anyway so it's just it's
just rather easy and helpful to
communicate with those guys and um yeah
I think that's that's the role where I
think being that bridge um I can be

[1:55:01]
think being that bridge um I can be
pretty helpful in and then uh hopefully
over the year I think now it's it's a
lot of talk but I think over the year
we'll see how things progress and the
trust is low I understand um but I also

[1:55:15]
trust is low I understand um but I also
I am in the unique position to see both
sides or let's say lots more sides
mhm and I also want to say
that things are not as bad as people
think they are on in a lot of ways this
is also this is the Dilemma right as a

[1:55:31]
is also this is the Dilemma right as a
security team you can also obviously not
be too transparent because they show
exactly how you do fix it that people
can take advantage of that so it's very
it's it's trust has to be established
and I think you know from both sides um
yeah only with actions I guess trust

[1:55:45]
yeah only with actions I guess trust
gets
increased I I agree and I I yeah I think
it's also it will probably not go away
in a heartbeat you know I think people
will be suspicious and there's obviously
also quite some Echo Chambers where

[1:56:01]
also quite some Echo Chambers where
certain misinformation is being repeated
and being spread there's a lot of things
on Twitter where I I I would actually
say from a personal perspective the
hardest part is um the Public
Communication of for example people
posting on Twitter a lot of it is more

[1:56:15]
posting on Twitter a lot of it is more
in the let's say on the negative side or
on uh around topics where you would need
to discuss um and that's the hardest
part for me is to not engage uh in in
every discussion because then otherwise
I'd spend six hours a day on Twitter and

[1:56:31]
I'd spend six hours a day on Twitter and
also I feel a lot of this doesn't
doesn't lead to much but for example
what what I really would urge people
looking in from the outside is that um
there's always a second side to it and

[1:56:45]
there's always a second side to it and
there's also a lot of people who have
high
incentive uh for certain things that are
maybe not aligned with yours if someone
is making a post
about like something not being allowed

[1:57:00]
about like something not being allowed
or rake being too high or you know
anything maybe they have an incentive
maybe they have something to gain of
this not being the case of course I
would
been yeah but that's that's really
important I think to to to also see the
other side where I mean rake is

[1:57:15]
other side where I mean rake is
obviously a very complex and very
sensitive topic also it also feels like
you know you get thrown under the bus
for basically anything you say on this
topic um but I think just this because
this topic I I think U Nick Howard
posted about this I'm not I'm not sure

[1:57:30]
posted about this I'm not I'm not sure
if you've seen the Tweet but this is a
topic where um I mean of course he
doesn't want things to be less
transparent because his business is
based on uh
transparen yeah I mean transparency on

[1:57:45]
transparen yeah I mean transparency on
on data analysis right that's that's his
business as far as I understand it so so
of course he wants data to be available
um and and I understand that part and I
think and the second the second side of
things is uh what he presents I
personally think that there's quite some

[1:58:01]
personally think that there's quite some
stuff being left out so the the image
that I perceive of this message is if I
would read it as you know someone else
is like oh you know these games aren't
beatable it's like but then the counter
question why would someone play 1.2
million hands if he if he loses uh 2 BB

[1:58:17]
million hands if he if he loses uh 2 BB
per 100 right that seems why all these
smart guys playing millions of hands on
on the site uh with other sites as
options where n1k is not like it's not a
thing of you know an impossible thing to

[1:58:30]
thing of you know an impossible thing to
find volume on on other side so what
what what is the side offering you know
what are maybe the things that are not
included in this um and I think he kind
of he he did it intentional because of
course he knows that the effective rake
or like when we talk about rakeback or

[1:58:46]
or like when we talk about rakeback or
when we talk about leaderboards which is
also effective rakeback to some degree
when we talk about marketing being spent
on when we talk about the quality of the
pools or the level of the pools so when
we take all these things into
consideration it now becomes a much more
uh

[1:59:00]
uh
tricky uh net of different variables
it's very hard to satisfy everyone you
lower the rake you have less marketing
budget you track less good games people
complain oh the games were so much
better back then you know it's like it's
hard listen it's going to be very hard
to to satisfy everyone I think there's

[1:59:16]
to to satisfy everyone I think there's
also going to be a lot of people that
are just never going to be convinced
right you can fix the majority but they
will pick one case where it didn't
happen they will use their confirmation
by you see security
sucks like most likely from both sides

[1:59:30]
sucks like most likely from both sides
you know this gonna happen it's
a I'm in for a treat with this you're
INF treat like I said don't waste try
try to find uh people to discuss with I
guess communication from both find
certain players that are willing to

[1:59:45]
certain players that are willing to
represent the Poke Community as players
certain people like your yourself to
represent the sites and have a
discussion and have both teams
understand the perspectives like okay
your intention is that you would just
want to be as most profitable at the
poker tables as possible maybe that's

[2:00:00]
poker tables as possible maybe that's
not necessarily our main concern right
so let's try to talk in a way that we
understand each other's objectives and
see how we can you know uh yeah work
together in uh in harmony so to speak uh
Adam do you have any uh any any things

[2:00:17]
Adam do you have any uh any any things
that you would like to add to this
conversation I actually had a really
good question from my community when I
as I said I was going on a podcast with
you and one of them was if you had to
start from zero how would you approach
poker differently today to get back to
high stakes um let me think about this

[2:00:32]
high stakes um let me think about this
one I think this is a very common
question I think I've also answered it
multiple times already but it's a good
question
nevertheless I do believe that what I

[2:00:46]
nevertheless I do believe that what I
would do right now is kind of what I'm
doing
for soon so I would find a group of
people that I believe have the potential
to play high
stakes um I think this is a very

[2:01:01]
stakes um I think this is a very
subjective thing but I put a lot of
emphasis
on the quality of output they produce so
the thoughts they have the the way they
talk the way they communicate how they
produce content um how it feels to

[2:01:17]
produce content um how it feels to
disass with them that's very important
to me
I think we have a very high level of
discussion and and output in our group
and that's always been uh for me a very
important part so I would surround
myself with people who I feel like the
quality of the output they produce is

[2:01:30]
quality of the output they produce is
very high and they have a lot of
potential to um and and drive to achieve
the same that I want to
achieve um and then it would be very
rigorous with grinding like I personally
think that in the current in the current

[2:01:45]
think that in the current in the current
landscape I would probably
spend um
60% of my time with studying and 40% of
my time playing so I'd probably play two
days a week for me personally it will
probably be Thursday and

[2:02:00]
probably be Thursday and
Sunday um or one day a week only Sunday
depending on how I feel and then I'd
drill a lot of the other 60% I'd
probably
drill something between 50 and 80% of
the

[2:02:15]
the
time and uh I'd go extremely heavy on
sub 60 big
blinds um mostly sub 30 sub 40 big
blinds and

[2:02:31]
um and
then the
majority of the rest of the time so
let's say if I drill 50 60% of the time
the majority of the rest actually I
would spent with payouts my personal

[2:02:45]
would spent with payouts my personal
perception of the current tournament
landscape is that I think I think the
understanding of payouts and the impact
on the strategy is pretty
weak and the really funny thing and and
and this would probably be the only
thing that would make me very excited

[2:03:00]
thing that would make me very excited
about poker I think the number one thing
right now to get a significant Edge is
the solver outputs for payouts and the
impact on the game in my opinion
are very bad kind of like the ranges

[2:03:16]
are very bad kind of like the ranges
from the guy in 2014 poker
strategy and I do believe that the next
breakthrough in this regard will be
based on AI models calculating outputs
because I think that what you have to do

[2:03:30]
because I think that what you have to do
is you have to look at strings of dozens
and dozens of hands that happen one
after another that lead to the final
outcome which is placement in a
tournament and you have

[2:03:46]
tournament and you have
to look at that and not
the dollar value that the ICM model
allocates and I think that will be once
that starts to get better I think the

[2:04:00]
that starts to get better I think the
the outputs we're looking at currently
will shift a lot
again and I do think that right now the
meta game in my opinion is leaning more
towards I think people are slightly too
sticky on average and people are
slightly too aggressive on average in

[2:04:18]
slightly too aggressive on average in
some spots not all spots but in some
spots and that makes a leaning passive
approach like a let's say a a tight
tight aggressive approach in my opinion
to be the most profitable right

[2:04:31]
to be the most profitable right
now
and that if I and that in a Nota is my
if if I would go about it again right
now I would take all those things
together have a group be very diligent
with study drill a lot and then when I

[2:04:47]
with study drill a lot and then when I
have like those drills I would try to
become very sharp with like create a new
philosophy
around where I think the bias of the
current model is leaning and then to

[2:05:01]
current model is leaning and then to
kind of counterbalance that and uh and
that uh that would be my that would be
my Approach so so this new idea I think
is very important if you want to if you
want to make it to the Top If you don't
have any new ideas I think you're not

[2:05:16]
have any new ideas I think you're not
not really going to make it wow what a
great answer very well thought out and I
love how structured it was and even
quantifiable in terms of how you were
dedicating your time to certain things
so thank you for sharing that if someone
was going to take that and write it all
down and try to implement that towards

[2:05:31]
down and try to implement that towards
their own approach to Pok what would be
some of the mistakes or potential
misapplications that they would have to
uh be mindful of as they're trying to
try to progress uh they're going to
drill poor
stuff um this is something I cannot

[2:05:48]
stuff um this is something I cannot
really explain I think because it's it's
probably one of my biggest strengths and
one of the things I've often seen other
people struggle with is this where
should I put my

[2:06:00]
should I put my
attention
and um for me it's just I have this
buil-in sensor that I trained a lot is
is where my my my my attention is
leading to just the most interesting
things for me and often the most
interesting things also seem to hold the
the most value for me so I think kind of

[2:06:18]
the most value for me so I think kind of
training that nose is very important
like I get a I get a bad feeling when I
spend my time on something I think
doesn't help me
progress and that's something I've
observed a lot is people spending time

[2:06:30]
observed a lot is people spending time
on things I feel like they get nothing
out of just for example to make them
feel safe or to make them feel
comfortable or you know just like repeat
a thing that they know they're good at
already just to feel like they're good
at this thing and um for me it's a bit

[2:06:47]
at this thing and um for me it's a bit
the opposite I I always lean to the
things where like oh I'm bad at this let
me drill this I'm bad at this let me
drill this give me exposure to this you
know teach me this thing I I suck at
this like I think when you drill try to
lean to the things that are very like

[2:07:01]
lean to the things that are very like
one thing that really helped me I did a
I did a I did an Excel sheet where I try
to evaluate the value I can gain by the
times it happens or the impact it has on
a tournament for

[2:07:15]
a tournament for
example so 100 big blinds
um there's a certain point where I can
gain a lot of value and if for example I
play a lot of tritons from the start
then that value is much higher because I
play more of
this game more pre flop that spot

[2:07:32]
this game more pre flop that spot
happens more often so 100 BB and 200 BB
study is much more valuable to me but if
I late regge tournaments online and my
average big bind is 55 and I the only
time I play to on a big BL te is in the
500 Bounty builder then I'm like this

[2:07:47]
500 Bounty builder then I'm like this
has absolute zero value for me and I
because the one thing is like 150 times
more valuable than the other thing so
don't look at like seven different
things but just like you know become the
best like that that's one thing I often

[2:08:02]
best like that that's one thing I often
see is in the new generation is there
there's certain things that are for me
like you have to breathe them why
they're not as sharp they're not as
sharp with their four big blind they're
seven big blind there 10 big blind
ranges they're not as sharp with like 12

[2:08:16]
ranges they're not as sharp with like 12
big blind call versus resof stuff like
this where it's just math you know it's
just like pure just get in the lab and
just like and that for me is like if
you're a turnour player zero to 20 b
blinds that's probably just about a

[2:08:31]
blinds that's probably just about a
thousand hours if you want to be the
best you got to do these these thousand
hours spread across your 10,000 hour
career at some point so um that that
that would
be uh a few of the things where I think

[2:08:47]
be uh a few of the things where I think
people tend to
to tend to get
distracted I think people tend to not
dig really deep into where is the most
thing to
gain and uh I think they're not rigorous

[2:09:02]
gain and uh I think they're not rigorous
enough so if you if you want to look out
to not make mistakes then i' really uh
take some time for reflection to really
ask yourself is like where am I not
pushing
enough I love that find sh in the scale

[2:09:16]
enough I love that find sh in the scale
of where to put your attention as think
in the modern poker climate that is one
of the kind of super skills that many
players struggle with they get
interested in spots as you mentioned to
confirm if they play a correctly or just
to uh their curiosi just takes them down
a rabbit hole that isn't so important

[2:09:31]
a rabbit hole that isn't so important
but sounds like for you a lot of time is
always spent on find you what is the
most high value for you to do right now
that's going to help your game moving
forward so you mentioned like this kind
of Excel spreadsheet which I'm curious
about is kind of frequency and the value
of the spots how much time do you think
players should spend or yourself did you

[2:09:45]
players should spend or yourself did you
spend on kind of mapping out almost like
a curriculum of things you should do
because one thing I find players
struggle with is overwhelm they're like
oh there's just too much to work on and
rather than like getting going through
Lads of different stuff they actually
get paralyzed and they almost like don't
do much at all so how do they kind of
map out like say the next months or

[2:10:00]
map out like say the next months or
years of their career what they should
be working on what's high value and how
do they even like map out that kind of
structure for themselves and they learn
a path I think I probably spent about 20
hours my entire career mapping out stuff
I'm not a I'm not a mapper for me it's

[2:10:16]
I'm not a I'm not a mapper for me it's
uh I think it's it's very valuable spend
time on becoming proficient with tools I
think a big barrier for a lot of players
is they're not really familiar with
setting up server a p solver or running
Sims or how to run a proper Sim or the

[2:10:30]
Sims or how to run a proper Sim or the
different the different variables
because if you don't understand the
variables you also don't understand the
weaknesses and if you don't understand
the weaknesses you don't understand
where to create a new or generate a new
idea to to maybe also see what are other
people working with and where maybe is
the thing you can gain an advantage on

[2:10:46]
the thing you can gain an advantage on
um and in terms of
in terms of the paralyzation I think
it's
actually not that important
to um to have a conscious thought of how

[2:11:00]
to um to have a conscious thought of how
much stuff you need to do as if I have a
conscious thought of all the things I
could be doing at all times it's just
unnecessary weight for me it's like in
every area there are things I can
improve
on that's obvious statement if you if

[2:11:17]
on that's obvious statement if you if
you don't agree
and I mean yeah of course so I can
improve in short like at every stack
size in basically every node now it's
more the question of which node helps me

[2:11:30]
more the question of which node helps me
the most and so I try to really just
have more of a natural flow
to follow because it's not only we we
are not we're not machines right so what
I try to do is is where where does it
have the the highest stickiness and for

[2:11:46]
have the the highest stickiness and for
me the highest stickiness does it have
when I feel the pain when I actually
want to know the answer like I under
like
2021 under gun shoves 11 big blinds you
know I'm under gun plus two I have nines

[2:12:02]
know I'm under gun plus two I have nines
you know or I have and then it's like
okay I I have tens and it's like okay
nines is a fold is tens a call is it not
nine left like I look at but if I don't
feel that if I just run the Sim in HRC

[2:12:16]
feel that if I just run the Sim in HRC
without having this pay and like final
table like I sit there in agony thinking
like it's probably closed is it losing
is it winning that's where I feel like I
mark this hand and I run it later it's
going to be 10 times more sticky than if

[2:12:30]
going to be 10 times more sticky than if
I just run it blank so what I try to do
is when I have insecurity somewhere I
ask myself a question I try to tie that
question to to an to a learning to a
drill to an output so when I play a
session I feel like you know I write

[2:12:46]
session I feel like you know I write
down like ha you know in this session I
felt most unsure about uh check raising
single race po out of position you know
I often didn't know like should I check
call should I check raise with frequency
so I'm going to look at that and I'm
going to drill that and I'm going to
feel more safe in the next session I'm

[2:13:00]
feel more safe in the next session I'm
going to apply that you know and then
it's just a constant Loop of that I have
a I have a awareness of asking
myself where do I feel how good in these
different things so it comes out
of pain or insecurity or like you know

[2:13:15]
of pain or insecurity or like you know
some form of tension and then I can
release that attention by studying and
it empowers me to the next session
already have something that I can work
with so I just don't really try to plan
out stuff a lot yeah I'm seeing like a
nice like feedback loop of using the

[2:13:30]
nice like feedback loop of using the
pain to guide you taking the next step
solving that problem and then going on
to the of the next step and for you it
sounds like your ability to be quite
reflective you mentioned other players
not going deep enough is kind of one of
your super powers as well so I'm curious
to know like how do you um what sort of
questions do you ask yourself let's say

[2:13:45]
questions do you ask yourself let's say
you're in a spot and you're unsure how
to play your strategy what what be some
of the questions you would ask yourself
before you went away in study date would
it just simply be what the ranges are
how do I play my certain strategy here
or is there any specific reflection
questions you come back to when you're
trying to learn more yeah I think as a

[2:14:00]
trying to learn more yeah I think as a
disclaimer it's important to say like
that's I think a a very good way as well
because uh it when I I don't feel a lot
of pain and poker right now I don't have
a lot of this oh I have to look this up
so that's why I also I don't study a ton

[2:14:15]
so that's why I also I don't study a ton
right now and um I just dip into the
things that I find interesting when
someone in our group does a coaching
like I can take away a lot from that so
right now it's actually less like this
when I but when I get back to Triton
it's like every day I'm like oh you know

[2:14:30]
it's like every day I'm like oh you know
I got to look at I want to look at this
I want to look at that so I think it's
nice also to have something that you're
excited about like find games you're
excited about playing I think that's
very helpful if you don't have games
you're excited about you're not really
going to have this driver I wanted to
add that and um like when I when I

[2:14:45]
add that and um like when I when I
approach a new study topic I
I I would say the main question I asked
myself it's not such a question but I if
I formulate it would probably be what
what what is the main mechanic that's
underlying or what's the main Mech
mechanic of

[2:15:01]
mechanic of
Poker um so yeah that would probably be
the main question is is what's the main
mechanic going on here what are the what
are the drivers so very often I look at
aggregate reports of all boards and just

[2:15:17]
aggregate reports of all boards and just
filter by different things just really
try to
understand um let's say in position
singer race pot right beted
sizes and I just look and I'm like okay
what are the main mechanics what is what

[2:15:30]
what are the main mechanics what is what
are what are patterns I just literally
try to look for patterns and then I see
ah okay you know I feel the right is
high I I I I start to see in uh an
overbed sizing um it's like okay it's um
what what what is the what is the common

[2:15:46]
what what what is the what is the common
ground it's like ah 10 9x uh
98x um it has to be disconnect it has to
be connected but not too connected no
Nots possible so it's like now start to
formulate these different ideas that
come up by just looking at that and

[2:16:01]
come up by just looking at that and
then I try to always capture 100% as
much as possible so not just have to
like oh you know like this particular
idea but rather like okay you know
smaller sizings on these type of boards
large sizing only on this type of board

[2:16:16]
large sizing only on this type of board
and and then I have a few ideas already
for this particular spot that I can take
away that are practical that I take into
the drilling session and then in the
drilling session I can see how well that
I actually how well can I actually put
it in in

[2:16:30]
it in in
practice amazing so good and yeah I
think the question you start with often
leads very much into how much value you
will get from learning at a study
session if you go in there trying to
think what the Sol is or to see what
strategy is going to be shown on a
solver for example you're not going

[2:16:45]
solver for example you're not going
anywhere near deep enough compared to
your approach of really understanding
what's driving the strategy that's going
to lead to a very different way of
learning and studying so yeah I'm really
really glad you shared such a specific
uh method and I think sometimes players
who want to get better I get ass this a
lot from players who want to improve

[2:17:00]
lot from players who want to improve
they always on specifics like what does
like fed do what's the question he asked
how does he shorten his days and want to
get those kind of nuance details so yeah
really glad you were able to uh to share
that with the audience so I Qui want to
wrap this up and I just want to have a
quick look into your days now I know
right now you're less full-time poker in

[2:17:15]
right now you're less full-time poker in
kind of the grinder lifestyle but it
feels like you have a very Balanced Life
overall very holistic views from what
I've heard so yeah talk me for like how
you uh go about your days maybe a day in
the life of feda at the moment and what
are some of the main things that you
prioritize in terms of managing your
energy which I know is important for you

[2:17:31]
energy which I know is important for you
right now it's really really chill to be
honest as as chill as it's as it hasn't
been in a long time so um it's not easy
to give a a very concrete answer because
it's more I would say different blocks

[2:17:47]
it's more I would say different blocks
that recur in a week
so I have certain things I schedule for
within a week so I have a few weekly
calls um with poker code with a poker
code
team um I normally wake up around 9: and

[2:18:02]
team um I normally wake up around 9: and
go to bed
around 11 to 12 something like that um
the evening I now lately have been
working a bit more but normally I spend
the evening with my
girlfriend um I normally get lunch with

[2:18:17]
girlfriend um I normally get lunch with
a friend or my girlfriend um and dinner
as well so um in between that it's
mostly work actually so a mix work you
know I for example right now I'd say I
probably spend about two hours a day on

[2:18:31]
probably spend about two hours a day on
crypto um I have kind of my my private
portfolio that I'm somewhat actively
managing and um also rather simple there
nothing nothing too fancy of my nfts
that I look after a few trades I

[2:18:45]
that I look after a few trades I
sometimes make and then the rest is um
mostly staked so just checking that from
time to time and just staying up to date
and then um yeah poker code I mentioned
I have two people that I'm um advising

[2:19:02]
I have two people that I'm um advising
on on their company where I'm also
invested so those would be calls I have
coaching with Elliot for example I have
another type of therapy I'm doing I have
personal training that I'm doing um
sometimes sports or yoga so it's really

[2:19:15]
sometimes sports or yoga so it's really
you know just more like I meet friends
so it's more like building blocks that I
uh that I have going on but it's not
like a it's not a crazy filed thing
anymore I have probably five scheduled
or four scheduled calls a week and um do

[2:19:31]
or four scheduled calls a week and um do
Sports meet friends food
sleep the basics yeah as you talking
there you can see you're doing the
things that interest you that you're
passionate about that you want to put
your limited time and resources into and
it looks a lot different to your like

[2:19:45]
it looks a lot different to your like
high volume grind ideas but you're still
having a lot of output in the hours that
you're doing you also mention like
certain blocks like when you're doing
the Triton Series everything flips
around and you're full-time grinding
mode as well uh but yeah I think you're
at that point now where you're able to
balance your time in terms of things
that interest you the most going forward
or excite you you mentioned like always

[2:20:01]
or excite you you mentioned like always
kind of following interest um what are
the things that you see in the future
potentially uh sparken more of your
interest or what currently get you
excited in the morning or excited in
your days and that's a great question
um I I would say I'm in this phase right

[2:20:16]
um I I would say I'm in this phase right
now where two things at the same time on
the one side it's clear to me that I
want to I want to dedicate myself more
to One Singular thing if you can say so
more in the sense of there's something
particular I think about working on one

[2:20:31]
particular I think about working on one
thing where right now I'm working a lot
of different things and and for me it's
really fulfilling to right now there's
really something where I if I can
Empower other people that's really a
sensation that I have in very few other
things so I want to keep doing that

[2:20:47]
things so I want to keep doing that
um and I think I have a good good volume
of that in my life right now so I think
the next thing is really more something
more
uh more concrete uh creating myself

[2:21:01]
uh more concrete uh creating myself
again because last two three years I've
scaled that down a little bit to have
some time to then see
um to see what's next and um I I don't
know which area actually I'm I'm very
interested in in gaming as in games not

[2:21:17]
interested in in gaming as in games not
in gambling or poker more in actual
games um more from the how how do you
create a really fun or or learning
experience for people who play your game

[2:21:30]
experience for people who play your game
who just very excited about the game
you're playing uh the game you
created um that's something because I
love the creative side of it the
creation process but also like this that
it has to be something that people just
are you know like can play for thousands

[2:21:46]
are you know like can play for thousands
of hours
um that's a word I want to dive deeper
into or maybe kind of do an do a
internship at one of the bigger game
development companies um that's
something I'm I I want to try to get
into this year and then

[2:22:03]
into this year and then
uh spaces I'm very interested in
like real spaces how people interact
with them um like living houses real
estate that's something I've been doing

[2:22:16]
estate that's something I've been doing
quite some stuff in
and buying old things renovating them um
but also creating spaces where um people
meet and and connect so this is
definitely something I'm going to keep
doing uh keep diving in more and

[2:22:30]
doing uh keep diving in more and
checking if there's some particular
venue or area that I'm that I want to
spend more of my time
on and then uh beyond that to be honest
I don't really know and those are like
two areas I I know I've had uh quite

[2:22:45]
two areas I I know I've had uh quite
some positive experiences with already
um I'll definitely also keep an eyee on
the the crypto side of things and the AI
side of things but there there wasn't
anything um there wasn't anything yet
like a direction it's it's I'm not such

[2:23:01]
like a direction it's it's I'm not such
a technical guy as well I like uh I like
more the creative things and I like
products I like customer experience and
I like how people engage with stuff but
I I want it to be as human as possible
so this

[2:23:15]
so this
a so in short I I don't know it but I
have a few a few ideas yeah lots of
interest there and yeah I'm really
excited to hear where your story leads
you next I feel like you're someone who
goes with like what you're interested in
and you go deep eventually once you've
got that kind of next thing so yeah it

[2:23:31]
got that kind of next thing so yeah it
sounds like there's so many ideas in
your mind one that I wrote down
empowering others you mentioned as a big
one as a good theme and that kind of
create like a learning experience
through gam games super interesting to
see where that takes you over the next
years so yeah first all thank you for
your time today we really appreciate it

[2:23:45]
your time today we really appreciate it
final question from me would be uh what
would be the main takeaway you would
like our audience to go away from this
conversation
with I would say
that this is quite abstract but I really
think that it was one of the keys to my

[2:24:03]
think that it was one of the keys to my
career and
also to other people around me is to try
to
generate new
ideas I think especially in the solo
world it's very easy to just become

[2:24:19]
world it's very easy to just become
good but I do believe that a lot of
power and energy comes from having ideas
in the sense of taking something that's
there and then evolving evolving that

[2:24:31]
there and then evolving evolving that
what's
there mostly identifying a weakness
identifying a bias
identifying something where this is
not resilient enough and then taking

[2:24:46]
not resilient enough and then taking
that and making it slightly more
resilient because if you just take the
thing that's there and then try to
replicate it just doesn't have this this
unique Spin and I think out of this new
Direction this new idea that's when you
start to create new things and more

[2:25:02]
start to create new things and more
things and then suddenly you have a big
Advantage so um I think to train your
mind to identify those things and to
train your mind to to be brave to take
those steps and take those risks and

[2:25:17]
those steps and take those risks and
make those mistakes and then maybe be
called silly sometimes and maybe other
people think you you know you to this or
you to that but um I think all those
people who have been highly successful
have been called this or that at some

[2:25:32]
have been called this or that at some
point in their
career what a thought-provoking answer
that could take us on to another two
hours of podcast but we'll wrap it up
here thank you so much for your time F
we really respect your uh wisdom that
you've shared with us today so many
things that you went deep into and give

[2:25:46]
things that you went deep into and give
us really good answer so yeah we
appreciate your time and thank you for
sharing with us today cheers R Adam I
appreciate appreciate you was a great
interview all right thank you feder for
sharing all your wisdom that you've
accumulated on quite a long long poker

[2:26:00]
accumulated on quite a long long poker
career not only poker career business
career investment career you shared a
lot of knowledge thank you for that Adam
any main
takeaways yeah there was a lot of wisdom
shared today and I love F's holistic
approach to life overall but in terms of
getting better at poker I think he
shared a lot about his journey of how he

[2:26:16]
shared a lot about his journey of how he
got so good so quickly he mentioned
channeling his curiosity into to
learning improving getting better and he
mentioned like it not being forceful how
he spends a lot of time on getting in
alignment with who he wants to be going
forward so in the early part of his
career being one of the best pocket

[2:26:31]
career being one of the best pocket
players and then the actions he takes
actually went effortful throughout
interest out of enjoyments um then
another thing I talked about in
alignment with that was creating this
kind of super peer group and I think
there's a lot of a lot of kind of really
in-depth conversation around how
important it is to have a group of high

[2:26:46]
important it is to have a group of high
players around you or a group of players
who are high level thinkers who think
like you would challenge you and he put
a lot of his kind of success but also if
he had approach poker from from scratch
tomorrow creating that group around him
would be one of the first things he does

[2:27:00]
would be one of the first things he does
so I think it's really important to uh
as you as you mentioned I think you
speaking to at this point going deeper
into what it means to create a peer
group what it means to create a group
around you and he's very big on that
impac in his yeah overall success in
poker then I think a lot of stuff about

[2:27:15]
poker then I think a lot of stuff about
expectation management M and I think
this is really important for anyone
listening who mentions like they want to
be a high Stak poker player they want to
play the level above they want to have
certain success in life you've got to
really realize do your actions align
with that not in the future but today do

[2:27:30]
with that not in the future but today do
you currently live the life the identity
of that individual who can achieve those
things and I think a lot of time youve
got to be realistic with yourself so um
you mentioned like a lot of players
might have other commitments other
things going in their life and for them
maybe poker is to facilitate their
overall lifestyle and that's good that's

[2:27:45]
overall lifestyle and that's good that's
a good thing but but don't kid yourself
that you're going to be a high St player
or you're going to be the best in the
world because your actions don't align
with that maybe your circumstances are
capped but that that is just what it is
um and then another thing I wrote down
is his holistic approach to Poker and

[2:28:01]
is his holistic approach to Poker and
getting better and he mentioned like
squeezing everything out of strategy
squeezing every Last Detail out of the
game and you can see when fed's in
really into something like especially he
po career he's almost obsessive like he
just constantly thinks constantly wants

[2:28:16]
just constantly thinks constantly wants
to improve Pro and he's got this mindset
of always trying to do things better and
this leads him to do different things
generate new ideas and do things outside
the box to other players but he's trying
to squeeze every bit of information and
strategy and and the final thing I wrote
down was his belief in himself was built

[2:28:32]
down was his belief in himself was built
through repetition of basically work and
this this surprised me B because I
thought fed might have been somebody who
U just had that natural belief you come
across these guys who was super
confident in themselves and these back
themselves in situations but he
mentioned going to the live scene in

[2:28:46]
mentioned going to the live scene in
particular
and struggling with imposter syndrome
struggling with belief and he had to do
a lot of work on studying players and
improving their strategy and finding
leaks and weaknesses and players to
build the belief that he belonged there
and that he could basically beat the GU

[2:29:00]
and that he could basically beat the GU
so yeah I think it's really put together
piec together a lot of a lot of the
story of how why F has been so
successful in his career and why he's
been able to uh yeah rise so quickly I
think even now he's only 30 years old
which amazes me because it feels like
he's been around for like 20 years uh
but yeah he's had such success but his

[2:29:15]
but yeah he's had such success but his
approach is yeah very fine tuned and
yeah I think there's a lot of lessons to
take how about yourself R what did you
write
down I wrote down he gave a little bit
of wink right when he also mentioned
like focus on the mechanics mechanics
poker when he does poker studying like

[2:29:30]
poker when he does poker studying like
look at the drivers he mentioned looking
at aggregated reports and seeing where
switches are in strategies oh wait on
this board we bet very big on this board
we don't bet very big oh what was one of
the ristics I think he mentioned oh
there's no nuts available so there's no
straight on the board for example oh and

[2:29:46]
straight on the board for example oh and
basically from there he starts to look
at okay what's the driver behind it and
then he learns a concept and then he
starts drilling that concept right he
was very big on drilling basically
repetition so that game now becomes his
new default game right he said he has a
lot of bad habits and the only way that

[2:30:01]
lot of bad habits and the only way that
he can get those bad habits out of his
game is to put him repetition with his
new slash improved game s to speak and
that's kind of where drilling uh came in
He also mentioned this we have mentioned
before if we heard other players talk
about as well focus on high e situations

[2:30:16]
about as well focus on high e situations
when studying right like you also
mentioned the poker tree is so immense
that we have to kind of start narrowing
down okay what are really high in high
where where do we get high Roi on our
study time right and those are usually
frequent spots and spots that have high

[2:30:32]
frequent spots and spots that have high
impact on your EV so for example in
tournaments ICM I remember uh kco was
talking about that he also talked about
sing pre flop a lot kco because it was
very frequent fader mentioned also like
okay yeah you shouldn't be studying to

[2:30:45]
okay yeah you shouldn't be studying to
on a big BL deep if you only late rack
online tournaments right so you should
look at okay what's the most common
average stack sitze that I'm playing and
though it's probably the stack SI that
you're going to have to master so for
the people listening you can just go to
your tracker say average stack size

[2:31:00]
your tracker say average stack size
let's say you pick your last 100K H
average stch size and then you just put
in an Excel sheet okay I play this Tech
size the most that's when you have to do
that's where you have to do most of your
studying and then you use the less
frequent stack sizes you might run the
same board for for that stack size and

[2:31:15]
same board for for that stack size and
think about what changes you don't have
to learn a different stack size no you
just look at okay I'm very good at the
stack size that I play the most what
changes if I change the stack size so
then we're going to learn the impact of
what's a higher spr spr lower spr spr is
going to do with my strategy right same

[2:31:31]
going to do with my strategy right same
with texture certain sees are going to
occur more frequently than others so
spend your study time wisely in terms of
spots that are uh frequent He also
mentioned in terms of studying figure
out or observe what are the most most

[2:31:46]
out or observe what are the most most
common ways that people nowadays study
poker and find the weakness in that
right what is the weakness of people
studying a lot with solvers and try to
come up with more original and creative
ideas around how to approach strategy

[2:32:00]
ideas around how to approach strategy
which could exploit the weakness of how
people are currently um approaching
strategy so yeah this were a couple of
takeaways that I had I'm sure you know
