free one hour demo yes yes yes yes yes
hello hello hello
boys and girls how are you guys today
got the green tea got the dark chocolate
on point as always wow i three bet this
tan jack off
this is mr goose and he calls
a dry flop and
this hand i will start with a half pot
first europa principles are great draco
thanks for making those
available to the public no worries my
friend
something some things that i learned
over the years
nicole's interesting turn
interesting turn
very high barreling frequency here for
my spot for my shoes
and i don't think there's a lot that he
can do to be honest
you see ace jack clubs
this is a little bit thin on the river
feels like it maybe this is just a check
fold it's maybe just a little bit too
weak
i'm gonna check fold the river it's
considering betting again
which if silver probably does
maybe a little bit too thin let's add
queen jack ace jack for sure
queens for sure
maybe a little like i don't
i don't mind a small bed on the river
everybody is excited
i've got a four bed and we're gonna flop
something nice actually we haven't
let's start off with charlie just to get
lucky
and i will win for guys and we will win
let's go
that's a good flop that's a good flop
i ain't hating
not the greatest of turns
that's again we're going to be calling
again
and we're actually probably going to
call this down as i think
for example he could easily play a hand
like ace jack this way
um i think if he has had like queens or
tens or something he could
still be uh slow playing
so unless i was gonna say unless we get
a very
bad river we're gonna just call this
down this is definitely
is one of these bad rivers he checks i
think i'm just gonna check
and hope to win
oh wow i said that i jammed it in i just
don't think there's
if you look at our bluffs on the river
ace queen is a hand that i could have
on the river actually maybe this is a
little bit overdone
if i have all ace queens this can be
this is a little bit dicey
i thought maybe a kingdom suited makes a
straight
ninth makes it boat tense already is a
boat
king jack is a straight let me know what
you guys think
oh three of pocket aces
[Music]
there's mr arborra we face the forbid
i'm going to call
good flop
i mean a four deuce deuce would have
even been better but hey
yeah let's not be too picky
he checks i think it's a fine hand to
check
behind
so let's hope he being the queen
now he just it was just a cooler played
out
very slowly get a little bit of a bigger
bed here probably still raising though
having a spade
interesting turn while my phone alarm
goes up okay
it's not not necessarily necessary
uh interesting turn going to check i
think this is a spot actually i'm gonna
do quite some checking again
and look to check raise certain hands
it goes check check interesting river
i'm going to block this hand
pull looks small but okay for a monday
yeah it's an okay pool
it has a little bit of everything and we
got called here by two pair
on the river tribe at
the ace king
face a format we'll sometimes call this
and we'll do now
i'm going to call the flop
and checks here is quite interesting
decided to bet myself i'm gonna have
some bets
i think ace king should definitely be in
there oh here
we check he checks back flop and now we
raised very small in the turn
interesting play
i think we're just gonna call we make
three pair
going to draw a little race with the
three pair
oh he re-raises okay that is
that is uh that's interesting
he checks back flop raises turns small
and re-raises the river
the [ __ ] do you have man
pocket eights i guess
even though yeah that's quite unlikely
pocket service and pocket days were
quite unlikely given my hand
i'm gonna start with a bet i don't
really mind if you check raises here i
call
so i three by that mr matthew to get my
money back
but mr aborer came intervene
intervened i think i'm gonna erase this
uh not normally you don't really do a
lot of raises
in position but i think with this exact
hand on this exact board i can probably
can probably do it uh hey
aces well i think did we also have the
same hand versus our board
only than the other way around so it
seems quite fair actually let's try a
little trivia with the seven dudes guys
we oh the seven deuce is over but you
know we see a seven dudes
we get the opportunity why not just make
a little three but
why not just why not just
just do do something funky sometime
why not just do something
why not just make a big bet on this flop
huh why not
boom then we show the seven dudes can i
show
i cannot show
um
i just show them drunken style and i
think it's good for poker like bring
some fun enjoyment
that one was for the for the seven deuce
fans
the people who are here still waiting
from the time from time to time i'll
throw out a little seven deuce just to
satisfy the fans while machu makes quite
a big three bet here
round three versus machu
oh match you match you mate
match you this is not a great flop
if you bet it's big i'm probably just
already folding
i have a feeling match is going to suck
us in again oh he checks back actually
that's quite
good news i would say usually
i think actually we can get away with
one big bat versus matu
we block 10 9 suited once
match you mate don't do anything stupid
or anything crazy
damn oh oh [ __ ] metro is now starting to
chat
if they chat and jam you know what time
it is
metro are you watching the stream mate
give me a [ __ ] pop mate come on be
social
i know we're no longer a fellow
europeans but
might
should i call ace high
if you don't like money oh
he should have waited cheers match you
might
much appreciate it sir
bono board i'm gonna do quite some small
betting
actually i won't actually don't really
mind betting checking this hand
so why not why not just mix it up i got
that from mr sherdock you got to mix it
up guys
gotta just mix it up filling bats
think half a cup
would you actually raise it kind of
depends on his strategy right
if you're just batting too much paris i
think raises
perfectly fine nothing we're going to
check i don't think
we usually have like maybe perceived or
at least after
hand like nine stands or like some jack
ten suited jacqueline suited
i think check calling is probably good
bets again goes for a small sizing
i think all we can do is call especially
if you look at if you look ahead there's
quite a lot of nasty rivers still
if you would check race
but the downside is that this is gonna
happen quite often so let's see what he
had
oh hey
he had ace jack
okay i don't think he should bat that on
the flop don't think he should bet that
on the
turn
and maybe has played bluff the river i
don't know
uh
oh that's a good bet my friend that's a
good bad bum
let's get the money let's get the money
mr reason very sorry reason even
fellow duchy ella duchy let's get some
of the dutch money let's go
snap faults if i stick to my schedule
which
i should
we next week we'll stream maybe i'll
stream on monday again and then
make like a three monday wednesday and
friday
not sure yet to maybe double announce
that it's not anymore on monday
maybe i'll do that we'll see
and then we're going to say goodbye to
500 zoom in our road from 5.00 to 10k
guys and we're gonna play
some 1k some 1k and some 2k maybe
depends on which tables are running
this guy made a small raise and make a
small bat we could sometimes still have
a chop he could sometimes do something
random we could sometimes
improve but i'm not very happy
i don't really know what's going on here
uh
but i'll go for the random factor
and he indeed had the random factor so
thank you very much sir
