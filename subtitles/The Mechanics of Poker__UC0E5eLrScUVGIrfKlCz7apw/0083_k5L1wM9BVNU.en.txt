[00:31]
you don't miss out on any new promotions
what's up what's up what's up what's up
boys girls
anything in the middle
how are you all doing that's today guys
we have a little high-stakes reel there
was a 100 know game running the other

[00:46]
was a 100 know game running the other
day
and we are going to review it
the good thing about the no delay is
always
that you guys can ask me questions
directly so it's usually going to be a
little bit more informative

[01:00]
little bit more informative
and we're going to try to guess his hand
guess guess what everyone has and what
everyone is up to so this is the game
that we're dealing with we see uh
kuznetsov
if i'm not mistaking
that is a

[01:15]
that is a
true teller could be wrong you guys are
probably better in railing these games
than i do
i mean limitless obviously is quite
clear
then the other russian is
god

[01:32]
muniz muniz
yeah that makes more sense who is munis
so nikki nikki follows minus or the
kuznetsov
and then we have an austrian guy

[01:46]
and then we have an austrian guy
t deutsche weiler
and then that's nikita um probably
very little folding here from the small
blind

[02:00]
blind
especially when there's antis i think
limping is definitely a must
the bot king deuce four it's actually a
board
i'm gonna ask you guys
see that's frequency on this board
we're gonna see that a lot

[02:15]
we're gonna see that a lot
very little medium
let me see if you guys are awake
low frequency one
it says
medium nah and then someone else high
and then we have it

[02:30]
and then we have it
another medium 60 high a lot
all over the place medium
those are the four impacts the big blind
how
some

[02:45]
some
poke education today yes
yeah so definitely not high
probably gonna be low to medium
indeed because of the deuce and the four
and uh
a three a five or six

[03:01]
a three a five or six
an ace
that could come off
so we indeed see a check
definitely another range bet if you're
arranged betting um
and it has everything to do with like
let's say for example right now 63 off

[03:16]
let's say for example right now 63 off
suit
we probably don't limp and he probably
has so
yeah big blind tree
checks back most forex and dosage we
don't really limp forex and do zack so

[03:32]
same on the turn
blue divider is dot we just found out
so yeah basically all the straight and
two pair
to pairs type of holdings that we

[03:45]
to pairs type of holdings that we
probably don't have that the big blind
has are now on the table
that does come out betting now with one
which i do think is good because if
limitless would have had a six a three
or like a two pair he would have

[04:01]
or like a two pair he would have
probably bettered it by now so i think
limitless most likely holding
um
it's gonna be an ace high maybe like an
a7 off suit or something or like a queen
high or a jackey or just a one pair like

[04:15]
high or a jackey or just a one pair like
a jack deuce a jack four
so i think doing quite a lot of betting
here as out of position is a good
strategy
yeah like king most of our card
but foreign dues for the big blind
exactly

[04:38]
that's uh
basically what he's asking is what is
the best course you're playing cash
games actually wait wait wait wait wait

[04:46]
games actually wait wait wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait wait wait wait
is this a button open and a small blind
call
and is this a donkey donkey
i think we have a little donkey donkey

[05:01]
i think we have a little donkey donkey
hey
we have a little donkey donkey donkey
donkey donkey you [ __ ] donk you do it
again i remember in a video before i've
told you to not dunk why do you do that
why do you do that so dumb

[05:17]
why do you do that so dumb
and you see guys he takes it down
more dunks guys more dunks i'm really
struggling to pay douceus 99 when i'm
playing in game any advice for how to
play these hands you mean advice on
pocket pairs

[05:30]
pocket pairs
i got you the last tip i have for you is
on small pocket pairs
and these are hands that you can win
monster pods so when you get delta
pocket pair try to flop a set
play it smooth and win all the money

[05:45]
play it smooth and win all the money
could i know a culture they're asking
you questions 100 especially if you're
going for
great you can ask you you can answer
those questions
we have culture at the moderator for all
your bankroll related questions

[06:00]
get a squeeze this guy is definitely
here for action
get a check check

[06:15]
get a check check
so again i think it's a spot i mean he
has been generating quite some action
right and he just got bought check
raised so maybe he's like with his
middle with his medium hands and his
drawers he's like okay let me let let me
slow down for for a little bit let's say
he has eight ace

[06:30]
he has eight ace
ace eight of diamonds or something that
he's maybe like or like an ace jack he's
like you know what
hey i'll just check this time and uh you
know keep the pot a little bit under
control
i wouldn't mind then in general you know
versus recreationals

[06:45]
versus recreationals
uh starting with some checks and seeing
what happens is uh stephanie's strategy
that i like
weird bet
[Music]
it's a very small bet in holland we
would say this is a keto bed which is

[07:00]
would say this is a keto bed which is
basically a tickle betty also known as
an induction sizing i've heard somewhere
along this road
where are you induction sizing
it seems to be an induction size

[07:15]
it seems to be an induction size
where i think he thinks i would fall for
this with
one pair type holdings
coffee not biting man coffee not biting
oh coffee is biting he called
interesting bet i'm i'm really curious

[07:30]
interesting bet i'm i'm really curious
what the
what he's doing this with
i would say that if you have a strong
enough hand to open the batting you just
wanted that big given how the how the

[07:45]
wanted that big given how the how the
texture looks
so ori's value betting very thin but
like pocket dance or something
or like a7 suited
sort of trapping
or obviously he's

[08:00]
or obviously he's
kind of
milking
with like ace five of clubs
planning on firing the river
i don't know if that's is that such a
great idea
and i was thinking

[08:15]
and i was thinking
the [ __ ] does this guy have
i want to see i want to see all cards i
mean
coffee is very likely to fold right
if they had value their min raise that's
actually a very good point
i do know uh you know

[08:30]
i do know uh you know
when the recreations they throw at this
little meme race
and you stare at your odds
they're easily luring you in
and now they change positions oh we got
a gym

[08:45]
that's a very incredibly strong and
aggressive play
so yeah now i would imagine truth teller
doesn't have a decision because all ants
that would not have a decision i would
say that big on the turn
and he's very credibly wrapping a flush

[09:03]
but then again he could also just turn
over king 10 off suit with a diamond or
a style suit with a diamond or it's that
instead of in general
uh
but still i would say this is uh

[09:16]
but still i would say this is uh
[Music]
i would i would say it's it's a it's a
very bad guys what what do you guys
think
i would say true teller yeah like i said
i don't think he's gonna time and this
is yeah
i give him the credit for the value he

[09:31]
i give him the credit for the value he
did actually time quite a lot if he
would have raced faster would have gave
him more value the longer he thinks the
more i i would say a bluff is possible
to tell actually has a decision that's
that's quite interesting

[09:48]
which hand are you betting one turtle
internet now as a decision
and another part from mr coffee
true taylor getting completely

[10:01]
true taylor getting completely
murdered yeah cafe is making sure you
know the donkey dunk is a present
definitely an action game
true teller coffee round three

[10:16]
and by the way guys
shout out to high stakes poker stream on
twitch
for if you want to see more
high stakes rail games go over to their
twitch stream

[10:31]
how do you study echo solver and
something else
mainly solvers
actually i have uh i've recorded three
youtube videos a day all
where all videos where i analyzed

[10:48]
where i analyzed the hand that i played
on stream and i kind of also dive into
the solver
so show you a little bit more of my
analytical side also i have a little
vlog coming out yes yes yes yes yes

[11:01]
vlog coming out yes yes yes yes yes
but i also give a bit more of an update
and some insights
a jammer from watson with ajax offers
pocket trees of truth teller
what the [ __ ]

[11:23]
guys
hey
he did not listen to

[11:31]
he did not listen to gavin
he did not listen i don't think it's
gavin approved to get threes in pre-flop
the last tip i have for you is on small
pocket pairs and these are hands that
you can win
monster pods so when you get delta

[11:47]
monster pods so when you get delta
pocket pair try to flop a set
play it smooth and win all the money
[Music]
they have very deliberation so people
wait
there was the action eraser 2.2 a call

[12:00]
there was the action eraser 2.2 a call
2.2 that 200 big blinds deep you have
pocket threes
this is the time to flop the set and win
a big butt
no he squeezes against mr watson who
gets it in with asic off and somehow
we're flipping

[12:19]
he rolled in 99
this is beyond me

[12:32]
incredibly strong and aggressive play

[12:45]
what's going on
all right all right
give it to me baby
what the [ __ ]
do you want to have a better
understanding of what's going on in

[13:00]

[13:16]
and how to get more success in poker so
do you want over 30k dollar worth of
value go over to this site and join our
mechanics of poker program
so here we have a race
a three bet
and a four bet

[13:30]
and a four bet
this is an action game guys this is
definitely an action game
missing him in the high sex overviews
now this was actually the only game that
i could find on the on the channel where

[13:45]
i could find on the on the channel where
on the high stakes poker stream channel
shout out
but from what i've personally seen
there's been quite a
there's actually been quite some action

[14:00]
you saw it here first boys bucket threes
exactly
so five four three flop
should favor um
[Music]
shoot favorite munis quite quite hard i

[14:16]
shoot favorite munis quite quite hard i
don't think threes fours and fives are
always gonna three bet the race
they're not always gonna
call the four bats
so you should be good
have you seen stefan graf versus
limitless nope but stefan crushed him

[14:31]
limitless nope but stefan crushed him
right
call has to be better want to play deep
versus recreational that's why true
eevee not making tier b from squeeze i
completely agree
with mr zay
eight

[14:48]
oh
we have a hit and run
we have a little hit and run
but we still have a 543 flop
we have a small seabed this is actually

[15:04]
not
i mean actually it's a cold for our cold
forward pot yeah
one third seems quite quite fine

[15:17]
bomb hunting at its finest
end of game yeah actually i'm already
running out of footage that
very quickly i remember in some other uh

[15:32]
very quickly i remember in some other uh
in some other shows we would do like uh
30 minutes and i would waste at least
one half hour now we're at one hour and
16 minutes
in my head in my head it would have
lasted longer the footage

[15:45]
lasted longer the footage
i have to say
the dilemma here for that
what actually does that have to do

[16:01]
okay he goes actually for the gem
okay yeah so it's actually actually i'm
gonna
actually look what what this hands gonna
do

[16:16]
i'm opening i'm opening the wizard
let me see what was the action
oh
that's not very smart the changing to
the changing button

[16:30]
the changing button
to get full screen is also the f5 button
so if i press it
it refreshes basically
so it's a race
a race
a fold
a race
a fold
a call

[16:46]
a call
five four three
all in quite often
for that position small but yeah i was
already thinking small but not really a
thing though
but he went for the 18.5

[17:01]
but he went for the 18.5
what do we do yeah it's like tenths
actually folding
that's actually folding we jam
yeah it's probably gonna be like jacks
or something right

[17:15]
definitely probably the the main hand
nine nine
actually nine nine
nine nine as well like for example it
went race three bad i would just call
nines like you're 170 big plants deep

[17:31]
nines like you're 170 big plants deep
versus the two and a big blind deep fish
monster tanker okay
poor play by the russian yeah poor play
by the russians
we need more russians i want bring the

[17:46]
we need more russians i want bring the
russians on bring more russians on
i'm here to get them all
he's going to ship it so this is a very
long tank guys
he just opened gto wizard

[18:02]
and he does he timed out
now that's a very
very sad ending right a timeout here we
go not iron 2t versus limitless

[18:20]
okay pre-flop a little bit optimistic
call
where's limitless

[18:40]
check race
this is also a good end you know it's

[18:45]
this is also a good end you know it's
not a set but also a good hand to build
a part with i completely agree
we get a flop 3 bet
i mean i guess you're b by a screen
suited and pocket fives and that's
basically it the rest is like combo

[19:01]
basically it the rest is like combo
draws but then again you're behind of
combo draws
whatever is blast like probably he's
gonna reach into like sixes with a heart
you do deny some equity
like a standard clubs as jagger clubs

[19:16]
like a standard clubs as jagger clubs
that's aggressive play
i'm i'm i'm a little bit curious now
actually
let's uh let's put this one up on
let's put it up on the solve

[19:32]
let's put it up on the solve
because i'm uh i think it's a little bit
dubious
jubius dubious i mean preflop but was
all a little bit
um
okay so we're just gonna pretend like we

[19:45]
okay so we're just gonna pretend like we
have h4
how do we do that
then we make the flop
oscar flop it sounds of the it feels of
the mystic okay so we make it uh queen
five
four

[20:00]
that's what we're gonna make it queen
five four
queen
five four
what are the suits
queen five four yeah
check

[20:19]
the problem is that i'm the shortcut so
i do i shouldn't do it with the shortcut
but the shortcut to go through the
screen is f5 and if you're in the
browser
it's not very good huh so kind of a
range is bad for small let's go for the

[20:31]
range is bad for small let's go for the
small
ace four of hearts not check raising
okay but they go for the strong and
aggressive play
king queen suited never three betting
but they go for the strong and
aggressive play

[20:46]
ace four of hearts is not existent
but probably not calling so their role
the conclusion is guys
they rolled high
quite often
that is uh that is kind of the

[21:00]
that is uh that is kind of the
conclusion and then they managed to get
it in here with a3
so yeah very uh very aggressive place
from both sides
i mean at least like ace queen you know

[21:17]
they want to avoid thinking yeah
but i do understand it as well if you
have h3 here getting it in is never
gonna be bad whereas maybe if you're
gonna maneuver you might make bigger
mistakes

[21:31]
mistakes
so maybe in a solver the call is indeed
better but you know the room for error
also starts to increase a little bit now
