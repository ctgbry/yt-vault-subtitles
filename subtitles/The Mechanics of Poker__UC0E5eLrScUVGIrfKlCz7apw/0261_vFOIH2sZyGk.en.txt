&gt;&gt; Sure. Single respon

[00:48]
in this kind of non um rake games. I

[00:52]
in this kind of non um rake games. I

[00:52]
in this kind of non um rake games. I
think I decided to make a quarter C on

[00:55]
think I decided to make a quarter C on

[00:55]
think I decided to make a quarter C on
the flop

[00:56]
the flop

[00:56]
the flop
which I will do with the range one to

[01:00]
which I will do with the range one to

[01:00]
which I will do with the range one to
bet here. This is the strategy that I

[01:03]
bet here. This is the strategy that I

[01:03]
bet here. This is the strategy that I
have and I think this hand is really

[01:05]
have and I think this hand is really

[01:06]
have and I think this hand is really
really good for seating.

[01:08]
really good for seating.

[01:08]
really good for seating.
Not only because you have one heart and

[01:10]
Not only because you have one heart and

[01:10]
Not only because you have one heart and
one club because you're blocking some of

[01:12]
one club because you're blocking some of

one club because you're blocking some of
the floats that he will do with but also

[01:16]
the floats that he will do with but also

[01:16]
the floats that he will do with but also
because you have some back doors you're

[01:17]
because you have some back doors you're

[01:17]
because you have some back doors you're
making falls of better hands. So I think

[01:20]
making falls of better hands. So I think

[01:20]
making falls of better hands. So I think
it's like at least in my point of view

[01:23]
it's like at least in my point of view

[01:23]
it's like at least in my point of view
and a standard play and

[01:25]
and a standard play and

[01:25]
and a standard play and
&gt;&gt; would you like range se bet this board

[01:27]
&gt;&gt; would you like range se bet this board

[01:27]
&gt;&gt; would you like range se bet this board
or you're just see betting because with

[01:29]
or you're just see betting because with

&gt;&gt; I would say I won't see range because

[01:35]
&gt;&gt; I would say I won't see range because

[01:36]
&gt;&gt; I would say I won't see range because
the seven is not a really good car for

[01:38]
the seven is not a really good car for

[01:38]
the seven is not a really good car for
my range and also in non rake games I

[01:43]
my range and also in non rake games I

[01:43]
my range and also in non rake games I
think he might be defending too many 7x

[01:46]
think he might be defending too many 7x

[01:46]
think he might be defending too many 7x
offsuit that I don't open. So not cate

[01:50]
offsuit that I don't open. So not cate

[01:50]
offsuit that I don't open. So not cate
range at least against I would ra but

[01:54]
range at least against I would ra but

[01:54]
range at least against I would ra but
having a slightly high seed to the small

[01:58]
having a slightly high seed to the small

[01:58]
having a slightly high seed to the small
size I think is my strategy here.

[02:02]
size I think is my strategy here.

[02:02]
size I think is my strategy here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah it's a great great great candidate.

[02:05]
&gt;&gt; Yeah it's a great great great candidate.

a really good candidate to choose. But

[03:17]
a really good candidate to choose. But

a really good candidate to choose. But
if the opponent is just racing too much

if the opponent is just racing too much
wider, which I thought he was, I don't

[03:23]
wider, which I thought he was, I don't

mind having more private in my range if

he's just full of bluffs.

[03:30]
he's just full of bluffs.

[03:30]
he's just full of bluffs.
However, I would choose right now like

However, I would choose right now like
probably the queen x of spades. uh quite

[03:35]
probably the queen x of spades. uh quite

[03:35]
probably the queen x of spades. uh quite
better than my hand.

[03:37]
better than my hand.

[03:37]
better than my hand.
&gt;&gt; But I but I like your thinking. Like you

[03:39]
&gt;&gt; But I but I like your thinking. Like you

[03:39]
&gt;&gt; But I but I like your thinking. Like you
first you you profile your opponent. You

[03:41]
first you you profile your opponent. You

[03:41]
first you you profile your opponent. You
think he's overdoing it. Yeah. When you

[03:43]
think he's overdoing it. Yeah. When you

[03:43]
think he's overdoing it. Yeah. When you
think it's overdoing it, let's just uh

[03:45]
think it's overdoing it, let's just uh

[03:45]
think it's overdoing it, let's just uh
fire back, right? If you run like some

[03:46]
fire back, right? If you run like some

[03:46]
fire back, right? If you run like some
notes, obviously handistics are very

[03:48]
notes, obviously handistics are very

[03:48]
notes, obviously handistics are very
important, right? When the equilibrium

[03:50]
important, right? When the equilibrium

[03:50]
important, right? When the equilibrium
is close, but as soon as people get out

[03:52]
is close, but as soon as people get out

[03:52]
is close, but as soon as people get out
of line, you can also get out of line.

[03:54]
of line, you can also get out of line.

[03:54]
of line, you can also get out of line.
So yeah, I I I appreciate that you just

[03:56]
So yeah, I I I appreciate that you just

[03:56]
So yeah, I I I appreciate that you just
made a read in a moment and just decided

[03:58]
made a read in a moment and just decided

[03:58]
made a read in a moment and just decided
you're out of line, so I'm going to go

[04:00]
you're out of line, so I'm going to go

[04:00]
you're out of line, so I'm going to go
out of line. I like that. Uh he does

[04:02]
out of line. I like that. Uh he does

[04:02]
out of line. I like that. Uh he does
actually call.

[04:03]
actually call.

[04:03]
actually call.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So basically I would say

[04:07]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So basically I would say

[04:07]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So basically I would say
it's not a bad turn for my range because

[04:09]
it's not a bad turn for my range because

[04:09]
it's not a bad turn for my range because
he will have in my opinion more A9 that

[04:12]
he will have in my opinion more A9 that

[04:12]
he will have in my opinion more A9 that
I have. He has a an offshoot in the

[04:15]
I have. He has a an offshoot in the

[04:15]
I have. He has a an offshoot in the
range and I don't um and he is going to

[04:19]
range and I don't um and he is going to

[04:19]
range and I don't um and he is going to
be racing more A9 that I'm going to

[04:21]
be racing more A9 that I'm going to

[04:21]
be racing more A9 that I'm going to
three bet. So I think I have to I have

[04:25]
three bet. So I think I have to I have

[04:25]
three bet. So I think I have to I have
to be really careful on this turn by my

[04:28]
to be really careful on this turn by my

[04:28]
to be really careful on this turn by my
betting strategy. I probably need to

[04:30]
betting strategy. I probably need to

[04:30]
betting strategy. I probably need to
check a lot and bet quite big if

[04:34]
check a lot and bet quite big if

[04:34]
check a lot and bet quite big if
theoretically speaking. I think my only

[04:36]
theoretically speaking. I think my only

[04:36]
theoretically speaking. I think my only
side here will be like three quarters or

[04:38]
side here will be like three quarters or

[04:38]
side here will be like three quarters or
almost spot. And I think here I probably

[04:41]
almost spot. And I think here I probably

[04:41]
almost spot. And I think here I probably
made a mistake in game by checking this

[04:43]
made a mistake in game by checking this

[04:43]
made a mistake in game by checking this
hand. I think if I had a if I want to

[04:46]
hand. I think if I had a if I want to

[04:46]
hand. I think if I had a if I want to
have one bluff or few bluffs on this

[04:48]
have one bluff or few bluffs on this

[04:48]
have one bluff or few bluffs on this
spot, probably my hand is one of the

[04:50]
spot, probably my hand is one of the

[04:50]
spot, probably my hand is one of the
best ones. I have the queen of hearts

[04:53]
best ones. I have the queen of hearts

[04:53]
best ones. I have the queen of hearts
that might helps me bluff some rivers

[04:57]
that might helps me bluff some rivers

[04:57]
that might helps me bluff some rivers
and I block some 89 and I also have one

[05:00]
and I block some 89 and I also have one

[05:00]
and I block some 89 and I also have one
hand that cannot call the turn. However,

[05:04]
hand that cannot call the turn. However,

[05:04]
hand that cannot call the turn. However,
in game I thought he had no full equity

[05:06]
in game I thought he had no full equity

[05:06]
in game I thought he had no full equity
here because I think when he had some

[05:10]
here because I think when he had some

[05:10]
here because I think when he had some
bluffs on the flop I think by threeing

[05:13]
bluffs on the flop I think by threeing

[05:14]
bluffs on the flop I think by threeing
them my hand I make them fold. And here

[05:16]
them my hand I make them fold. And here

[05:16]
them my hand I make them fold. And here
I could maybe only get full pocket

[05:20]
I could maybe only get full pocket

[05:20]
I could maybe only get full pocket
fives, pocket six, sixes, pocket four

[05:22]
fives, pocket six, sixes, pocket four

[05:22]
fives, pocket six, sixes, pocket four
that raise the flop and call. I don't

[05:25]
that raise the flop and call. I don't

[05:25]
that raise the flop and call. I don't
think this guy was folding any 10 or any

[05:27]
think this guy was folding any 10 or any

[05:27]
think this guy was folding any 10 or any
jack and against a seven I almost draw

[05:30]
jack and against a seven I almost draw

[05:30]
jack and against a seven I almost draw
in dead. So I decide to just have no

[05:33]
in dead. So I decide to just have no

[05:33]
in dead. So I decide to just have no
bluffs here and check my hand. That was

[05:36]
bluffs here and check my hand. That was

[05:36]
bluffs here and check my hand. That was
my main process.

[05:38]
my main process.

[05:38]
my main process.
&gt;&gt; I like it. You gave both kind of the

[05:39]
&gt;&gt; I like it. You gave both kind of the

[05:39]
&gt;&gt; I like it. You gave both kind of the
theoretical and the more and a more

[05:41]
theoretical and the more and a more

[05:41]
theoretical and the more and a more
applicable exploitative type of

[05:43]
applicable exploitative type of

[05:43]
applicable exploitative type of
approach. Yeah, I I definitely agree.

[05:45]
approach. Yeah, I I definitely agree.

[05:45]
approach. Yeah, I I definitely agree.
Especially if he has a 10, it's probably

[05:47]
Especially if he has a 10, it's probably

[05:47]
Especially if he has a 10, it's probably
10 n 108. Definitely not folding.

[05:49]
10 n 108. Definitely not folding.

[05:49]
10 n 108. Definitely not folding.
&gt;&gt; So yeah, I think I think betting here

[05:50]
&gt;&gt; So yeah, I think I think betting here

[05:50]
&gt;&gt; So yeah, I think I think betting here
would be effective if he folds a hand

[05:53]
would be effective if he folds a hand

[05:53]
would be effective if he folds a hand
like queen jack or king jack, but he's

[05:56]
like queen jack or king jack, but he's

[05:56]
like queen jack or king jack, but he's
obviously not folding jack 10 or jack

[05:57]
obviously not folding jack 10 or jack

[05:57]
obviously not folding jack 10 or jack
nine or jack eight if he if he raised

[05:59]
nine or jack eight if he if he raised

[05:59]
nine or jack eight if he if he raised
that. Uh so yeah, I and probably jack

[06:04]
that. Uh so yeah, I and probably jack

[06:04]
that. Uh so yeah, I and probably jack
10, jack nine and stuff are probably a

[06:06]
10, jack nine and stuff are probably a

[06:06]
10, jack nine and stuff are probably a
higher race frequency. So yeah, I uh I

[06:09]
higher race frequency. So yeah, I uh I

[06:09]
higher race frequency. So yeah, I uh I
agree with your play. He you check in,

[06:11]
agree with your play. He you check in,

[06:11]
agree with your play. He you check in,
you get the free card

[06:13]
you get the free card

[06:13]
you get the free card
&gt;&gt; and we [ __ ] something. So that's good.

[06:16]
&gt;&gt; and we [ __ ] something. So that's good.

[06:16]
&gt;&gt; and we [ __ ] something. So that's good.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Basically, regarding the turn, I

[06:19]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Basically, regarding the turn, I

[06:19]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Basically, regarding the turn, I
think I have no equity because I think

[06:21]
think I have no equity because I think

[06:21]
think I have no equity because I think
in theory he he should fold any some

[06:24]
in theory he he should fold any some

[06:24]
in theory he he should fold any some
jackex and this guy or maybe the meta is

[06:27]
jackex and this guy or maybe the meta is

[06:27]
jackex and this guy or maybe the meta is
not folding too many. So that's why I

[06:28]
not folding too many. So that's why I

[06:28]
not folding too many. So that's why I
check and then the river. Yeah, I hit

[06:30]
check and then the river. Yeah, I hit

[06:30]
check and then the river. Yeah, I hit
the topper. I think my hand is almost

[06:33]
the topper. I think my hand is almost

[06:33]
the topper. I think my hand is almost
best here. I think his range is mostly

[06:36]
best here. I think his range is mostly

[06:36]
best here. I think his range is mostly
composed of 10x as you said previously

[06:39]
composed of 10x as you said previously

[06:39]
composed of 10x as you said previously
1089 and some jackex. So I think I have

[06:42]
1089 and some jackex. So I think I have

[06:42]
1089 and some jackex. So I think I have
a clear value on this river. The only

[06:44]
a clear value on this river. The only

[06:44]
a clear value on this river. The only
thing we have to think is the size. So

[06:48]
thing we have to think is the size. So

[06:48]
thing we have to think is the size. So
basically uh because I don't think uh

[06:51]
basically uh because I don't think uh

[06:51]
basically uh because I don't think uh
this opponent or maybe most of the

[06:53]
this opponent or maybe most of the

[06:53]
this opponent or maybe most of the
opponents that I play they will raise

[06:56]
opponents that I play they will raise

[06:56]
opponents that I play they will raise
too many jacks on the flop like jack

[06:58]
too many jacks on the flop like jack

[06:58]
too many jacks on the flop like jack
nine jack eight and I think it will be

[07:01]
nine jack eight and I think it will be

[07:01]
nine jack eight and I think it will be
more towards 10x. I think his rate his

[07:05]

[09:57]
strategy on the river as a race

[09:57]
strategy on the river as a race
I think using an eight or a nine is

[09:59]
I think using an eight or a nine is

[09:59]
I think using an eight or a nine is
better. So yeah, um I think I like his

[10:06]
better. So yeah, um I think I like his

[10:06]
better. So yeah, um I think I like his
races on the flop. If I was him, I will

[10:09]
races on the flop. If I was him, I will

[10:09]
races on the flop. If I was him, I will
just bet the turn because in my opinion,

[10:13]
just bet the turn because in my opinion,

[10:13]
just bet the turn because in my opinion,
um

[10:15]
um

[10:15]
um
me or all the players won't have the

[10:17]
me or all the players won't have the

me or all the players won't have the
range as protected as it should on the

[10:21]
range as protected as it should on the

[10:21]
range as protected as it should on the
turn. So you can bet small or even half

[10:25]
turn. So you can bet small or even half

[10:25]
turn. So you can bet small or even half
pot on the turn and probably value bet

[10:29]
pot on the turn and probably value bet

[10:29]
pot on the turn and probably value bet
against some 10x or just for example uh

[10:33]
against some 10x or just for example uh

probably I don't know what I will do in

[10:40]
probably I don't know what I will do in

[10:40]
probably I don't know what I will do in
on the turn but I won't call never or

[10:43]
on the turn but I won't call never or

[10:43]
on the turn but I won't call never or
maybe I'll double to raise or I just

[10:45]
maybe I'll double to raise or I just

[10:45]
maybe I'll double to raise or I just
fold and probably the last one. So yeah,

[10:48]
fold and probably the last one. So yeah,

[10:48]
fold and probably the last one. So yeah,
I think if I was him, I would just block

[10:51]
I think if I was him, I would just block

[10:51]
I think if I was him, I would just block
the turn. And then on the river,

[10:54]
the turn. And then on the river,

[10:54]
the turn. And then on the river,
I think this is magic. But uh I don't

[10:57]
I think this is magic. But uh I don't

[10:57]
I think this is magic. But uh I don't
know. You got to think I'm folding

[11:01]
know. You got to think I'm folding

[11:01]
know. You got to think I'm folding
almost 100% to bluff this hand.

[11:03]
almost 100% to bluff this hand.

[11:03]
almost 100% to bluff this hand.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And yeah, the king king is pretty

[11:05]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And yeah, the king king is pretty

[11:05]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And yeah, the king king is pretty
bad. I guess you want you to have pocket

could play this way or ace jack maybe.

[11:11]
could play this way or ace jack maybe.

[11:11]
could play this way or ace jack maybe.
So yeah, like you said, uh the 10 9 or

[11:13]
So yeah, like you said, uh the 10 9 or

[11:13]
So yeah, like you said, uh the 10 9 or
the 108 probably already enough

the 108 probably already enough
combatorically speaking, right? And

[11:17]
combatorically speaking, right? And

[11:17]
combatorically speaking, right? And
probably also just better candidates. So

[11:20]
probably also just better candidates. So

[11:20]
probably also just better candidates. So
uh yeah, nice hand. Next one.

[11:22]
uh yeah, nice hand. Next one.

[11:22]
uh yeah, nice hand. Next one.

&gt;&gt; You get a race three colors. Squeeze it
up.

[11:28]

we play a squeeze spot. Uh that has

[11:42]
we play a squeeze spot. Uh that has
almost 50 blinds on the flop. Yeah. So

[11:46]
almost 50 blinds on the flop. Yeah. So

[11:46]
almost 50 blinds on the flop. Yeah. So
kind of interesting one. Okay. Um I

[11:50]
kind of interesting one. Okay. Um I

kind of interesting one. Okay. Um I
remember playing that tan and thinking

[11:52]

remember playing that tan and thinking
that uh against three ranges I need to

[11:55]
that uh against three ranges I need to

[11:55]
that uh against three ranges I need to
be really careful about my bluffs here

[11:57]
be really careful about my bluffs here

[11:58]
be really careful about my bluffs here
because what are my values here when I

[12:01]
because what are my values here when I

[12:01]
because what are my values here when I
squeeze? Probably a hand like king queen

[12:04]
squeeze? Probably a hand like king queen

[12:04]
squeeze? Probably a hand like king queen
maybe it's not good enough to have three

[12:06]
maybe it's not good enough to have three

[12:06]
maybe it's not good enough to have three
threes of value against those ranges. So

[12:08]
threes of value against those ranges. So

[12:08]
threes of value against those ranges. So
if I'm betting ace king plus or

[12:11]
if I'm betting ace king plus or

[12:11]
if I'm betting ace king plus or
something like that, I got to be really

[12:13]
something like that, I got to be really

[12:13]
something like that, I got to be really
careful about how much bluff is I'm

[12:15]
careful about how much bluff is I'm

[12:15]
careful about how much bluff is I'm
choosing. So probably just bluffing with

[12:19]
choosing. So probably just bluffing with

[12:19]
choosing. So probably just bluffing with
queen jack or jack nine if I have it um

catcher in any spot. So I just thought

[12:41]
catcher in any spot. So I just thought

catcher in any spot. So I just thought
checking here with my hand

[12:43]
checking here with my hand

[12:44]
checking here with my hand
is the best move even though the board

[12:45]
is the best move even though the board

think Bentor is over bluffing this spot

[13:57]
think Bentor is over bluffing this spot

[13:57]
think Bentor is over bluffing this spot
massively on the flop because he's a guy

[14:00]
massively on the flop because he's a guy

[14:00]
massively on the flop because he's a guy
that likes to protect the ranges and he

[14:03]
that likes to protect the ranges and he

[14:03]
that likes to protect the ranges and he
even might trap here pocket sense. So I

[14:08]
