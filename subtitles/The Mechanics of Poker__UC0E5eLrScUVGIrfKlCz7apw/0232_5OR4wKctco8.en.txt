Um, I mean for sure the variance I think

[1:13:55]
Um, I mean for sure the variance I think
because uh some sometimes you can play

[1:13:57]
because uh some sometimes you can play

during those patches? You mentioned
playing a lot and studying a lot

[1:14:38]
playing a lot and studying a lot

Good question. I think that's the

[1:14:50]
Good question. I think that's the

[1:14:50]
Good question. I think that's the
hardest part of a swing. Um because

[1:14:53]
hardest part of a swing. Um because

[1:14:53]
hardest part of a swing. Um because
there is no way that you're ever going

[1:14:54]
there is no way that you're ever going

[1:14:54]
there is no way that you're ever going
to have the confidence level that you

[1:14:56]
to have the confidence level that you

[1:14:56]
to have the confidence level that you
normally have. You're always going to be

[1:14:58]
normally have. You're always going to be

[1:14:58]
normally have. You're always going to be
doubting yourself a little bit more. It

[1:15:00]
doubting yourself a little bit more. It

[1:15:00]
doubting yourself a little bit more. It
doesn't matter how good of a player you

[1:15:02]
doesn't matter how good of a player you

[1:15:02]
doesn't matter how good of a player you
are. I think I mean maybe there are

[1:15:04]
are. I think I mean maybe there are

[1:15:04]
are. I think I mean maybe there are
exceptions in this case. I I don't know,

[1:15:06]
exceptions in this case. I I don't know,

[1:15:06]
exceptions in this case. I I don't know,
but I would say that you almost never

[1:15:09]
but I would say that you almost never

[1:15:09]
but I would say that you almost never
have the confidence on the same level.

[1:15:11]
have the confidence on the same level.

[1:15:11]
have the confidence on the same level.
So yeah, it's it's it's a very hard

[1:15:13]
So yeah, it's it's it's a very hard

[1:15:13]
So yeah, it's it's it's a very hard
question and uh I don't have a clear

[1:15:15]
question and uh I don't have a clear

[1:15:16]
question and uh I don't have a clear
answer for this, but uh I just think

[1:15:18]
answer for this, but uh I just think

[1:15:18]
answer for this, but uh I just think
that doing the small basic stuff which

[1:15:20]
that doing the small basic stuff which

[1:15:20]
that doing the small basic stuff which
can increase your confidence a little

[1:15:22]
can increase your confidence a little

[1:15:22]
can increase your confidence a little

Yeah, I think it's just not having that
major drop off. Obviously, there's going

[1:15:29]
major drop off. Obviously, there's going

[1:15:29]

to be some deviations in confidence

[1:15:31]
to be some deviations in confidence

[1:15:31]
to be some deviations in confidence
relative to circumstances, but if you

jump to high stakes? Um I think it's

[1:16:02]
jump to high stakes? Um I think it's

[1:16:02]
jump to high stakes? Um I think it's
like I would say it's it's when there is

[1:16:05]
like I would say it's it's when there is

[1:16:05]
like I would say it's it's when there is
like on for example on a weekday when

[1:16:07]
like on for example on a weekday when

[1:16:07]
like on for example on a weekday when
there is no higher binds I would say

[1:16:09]
there is no higher binds I would say

there is no higher binds I would say
it's like the 500 1k uh ABI kind of uh

it's like the 500 1k uh ABI kind of uh
tournaments like at that point there is

[1:16:15]
tournaments like at that point there is

[1:16:15]
tournaments like at that point there is
not much much higher stuff like then

[1:16:17]
not much much higher stuff like then

[1:16:17]
not much much higher stuff like then
there is uh 5ks and 10ks on Sunday and

[1:16:20]
there is uh 5ks and 10ks on Sunday and

there is uh 5ks and 10ks on Sunday and
obviously this is like the these are the

[1:16:23]
obviously this is like the these are the

[1:16:23]
obviously this is like the these are the

[1:16:32]
from I guess the 500 1k daily. But I

[1:16:32]
from I guess the 500 1k daily. But I
would say that's like the that's when

What's your process for accepting

[1:17:51]
What's your process for accepting

[1:17:51]
What's your process for accepting
losses? I know it's easy to brush over

[1:17:53]
losses? I know it's easy to brush over

[1:17:53]
losses? I know it's easy to brush over
that and go, "Yeah, I accept that I lose

[1:17:55]
that and go, "Yeah, I accept that I lose

[1:17:55]
that and go, "Yeah, I accept that I lose
30k." But I think a lot of players

[1:17:56]
30k." But I think a lot of players

[1:17:56]
30k." But I think a lot of players
struggle with what it's like to actually

[1:17:58]
struggle with what it's like to actually

[1:17:58]
struggle with what it's like to actually
accept for you. What's that process look

[1:18:00]
accept for you. What's that process look

Um, I think like the the areas that you
struggle the most with and then

[2:14:46]

struggle the most with and then
obviously like the deeper the tournament

[2:14:48]
obviously like the deeper the tournament

[2:14:48]
obviously like the deeper the tournament
gets, the more your decisions are uh

[2:14:51]
gets, the more your decisions are uh

[2:14:51]
gets, the more your decisions are uh
going to net money or lose money. Uh, so

also me from time to time, but it's a

[2:41:37]
also me from time to time, but it's a

[2:41:37]
also me from time to time, but it's a
really big league to get into the state

[2:41:39]
really big league to get into the state

[2:41:39]
really big league to get into the state
where you don't mind busting a

like that. And if you do, then that
means something has gone wrong

[2:41:45]
means something has gone wrong

[2:41:45]
means something has gone wrong
somewhere. So, um yeah, I guess uh what

[2:41:49]
somewhere. So, um yeah, I guess uh what

[2:41:49]
somewhere. So, um yeah, I guess uh what
I'm trying to do is is actively try to

[2:41:52]
I'm trying to do is is actively try to

[2:41:52]
I'm trying to do is is actively try to
um kind of find the solutions of how I

[2:41:57]
um kind of find the solutions of how I

[2:41:57]
um kind of find the solutions of how I
uh figure out how it's not happening

[2:41:58]
uh figure out how it's not happening

[2:41:58]
uh figure out how it's not happening
during the session. And for me, most

[2:42:00]
during the session. And for me, most

[2:42:00]
during the session. And for me, most
important thing is sleep for sure. So if

[2:42:03]
important thing is sleep for sure. So if

[2:42:03]
important thing is sleep for sure. So if
I sleep badly then uh I know it's going

[2:42:06]
I sleep badly then uh I know it's going

[2:42:06]
I sleep badly then uh I know it's going
to happen just because I'm tired you

[2:42:08]
