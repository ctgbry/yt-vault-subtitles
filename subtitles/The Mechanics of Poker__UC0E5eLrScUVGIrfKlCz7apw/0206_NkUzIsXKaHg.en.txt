[00:00]
yeah let's get a bit vulnerable I guess
there's a lot of challenges that I
hadn't foreseen that came to the surface
after winning um that gave me both
anxiety and stress and all these
things turns out that uh what winning 10

[00:17]
things turns out that uh what winning 10
million is not uh just a matter of next
day it wires you to your bank account
and it's like all happy times
right yeah there yeah there was quite a
bit of issues I didn't get paid out for
six months because um IRS didn't accept

[00:31]
six months because um IRS didn't accept
my UK proof of residency and then there
was tax lawyers involved from Norway UK
and the US that process is still going
on but hopefully nearly finished so
there's been a lot of um yeah More Money

[00:47]
there's been a lot of um yeah More Money
More
Problems yeah I mean I don't want to sit
here and complain about it because it's
a good problem to have obviously but it
has added um stress and anxxiety to my
life that's for sure but yeah not going

[01:01]
life that's for sure but yeah not going
to complain I want to talk now about you
being a high performer so when I think
about Espin I think High performer very
um thinks a lot about the lifestyle
factors that go into performing at the
high level what are some of the things
you feel cultivate high performance for

[01:15]
you feel cultivate high performance for
yourself and you shown up as your best
self and does that differ in an online
environment compared to say a live
Series yeah so I think for me this is I
don't want to sound too repetitive but
but it all stems down to childhood

[01:30]
but it all stems down to childhood
insecurities and Egos and like how you
channel that
into um doing good things I think for me
at least like I think that's a big part
of my success and I also think it's a
big part of this resilience that we

[01:47]
big part of this resilience that we
spoke about before
where so my adult life has
been
pretty easy I would say very little
downswings in my adult life it's been

[02:00]
downswings in my adult life it's been
very uh like one big upswing for the
most part but my early life my childhood
and teenage years were maybe the
opposite I would say like I didn't have
like particularly easy childhood um and
I think maybe this has made me a bit

[02:18]
I think maybe this has made me a bit
more resilient
to what seems like minor problems later
in life where you start like
comparing
yeah some stuff that would affect PE if

[02:31]
yeah some stuff that would affect PE if
you've had like the easiest life ever
and you've never had any
trauma any like difficult situations or
whatever if you face minor stuff later
in life they're probably going to affect
you quite a bit right but if you started

[02:45]
you quite a bit right but if you started
off by having a lot of emotional trauma
a lot of difficult
situations um I was also like very like
during elementary school high school I
was like a little weird fat kid you know
like no social antennas very weird we

[03:00]
like no social antennas very weird we
anxious little kid and obviously not a
popular kid at school
um and I think that combined with like
not having the easiest time at home and
all of this I think it kind of creates

[03:15]
all of this I think it kind of creates
this resiliency later where if you run
into problems later in life you're
you're kind of just they kind of don't
hit you the same way I think um and I
think there's a lot of evidence if you
see like the

[03:31]
see like the
if you go back to the all
like people who Channel their
insecurities and childhood uh issues and
Egos and stuff into doing good things I
think there's quite a bit of evidence of

[03:45]
think there's quite a bit of evidence of
this like the people that were like the
jocks that were crushing it in high
school uh the popular guy who like got
all the girls who was like the captain
of the football team or whatever pickier
classic cliche scenario right um a lot

[04:00]
classic cliche scenario right um a lot
of these people maybe don't have the
same Drive later in life to prove
something while the Nerds the guys who
got picked on the little fat guys or the
guys who are like in the chess club or
whatever maybe they have a bit more
reason later in life to prove something

[04:16]
reason later in life to prove something
they want to make up for um they want to
prove to the jocks that were bullying
them in sixth grade you know that uh I'm
not this loser that you called me like
you know I think there's a lot to this
and um I think that's that has been like

[04:30]
and um I think that's that has been like
a big part of
my success in poker and in uh you
mentioned like high performance in terms
of like getting in better shape and all
of this like I mentioned I used to be
like very out of shape when I was
younger now I'm in like reasonable shape

[04:46]
younger now I'm in like reasonable shape
um and I think that's like also just
based because of this that I I got
picked on for being fat now I'm trying
to get in now I'm trying to have a
six-pack to prove them wrong you know
it's it's so yeah I came from not having

[05:00]
it's it's so yeah I came from not having
any money when I was younger now I'm
trying to make all the money I I used to
not uh like all of these things you know
it's so like if you do like some psycho
analysis or like self um if you look a
bit into the past it's sometimes kind of

[05:15]
bit into the past it's sometimes kind of
easy to figure out why we do certain
things it's like a lot of it just stems
from childhood stuff right and I think
that was a big part for me that
I'm channeling this childhood stuff into
into to my adult life and trying to use

[05:31]
into to my adult life and trying to use
it for something positive so yeah yeah
and I think that's the main thing like
that ability to channel it in the right
direction because other people would go
through similar experiences and it would
overwhelm them they might not build that
resilience as you've started to achieve

[05:45]
resilience as you've started to achieve
a lot of the things so like you said
you've you wanted the success you wanted
the U the good better body and lose the
weight you've started to like from the
outside at least like kind of prove
these things already what happens that
next level do you still feel like you
tap back into I still want to prove
something I know you mentioned going

[06:00]
something I know you mentioned going
back into uh the kind of high roller
scene to kind of still prove you weren't
a one hit wonder but on a on a deeper
level do you feel like your
transitioning your motives from having
to prove to other people while you're
doing stuff to a few more bit more
intrinsic because I feel like at some
point we can transition out of that we

[06:15]
point we can transition out of that we
can see our operating system we can see
what's Driven our past behaviors and how
we've utilize that as a fuel source we
go awesome it's got me to where I am but
then we can start think okay right now
I'm here now I'm at the where I want to
be I've proved everyone wrong all right
what do I want to do for me what's what
do I want what's my kind of goals have
you do you feel like your transition

[06:31]
you do you feel like your transition
into understanding what Espin wants and
what his goals are going
forward that's definitely the next step
of the journey I would say I'm
definitely not there yet I still have um
stuff that I'm dealing with
and yeah I don't know I'm

[06:47]
and yeah I don't know I'm
not yeah I'm not there yet for sure like
this year I my focus is going to be a
bit to try to land and to remove some
stress and anxiety from my life

[07:00]
stress and anxiety from my life
um like because before winning the main
event like as I said my adult life was
big upswing only I didn't have much
stress
anxiety uh I felt pretty resilient like
I think you mentioned like a lot of
people that face adversity it becomes

[07:17]
people that face adversity it becomes
overwhelming and for me it was
definitely that as well when I was
younger like in my teenage years this
was the reason I was playing all these
video games right like why I was in AER
rooth playing World of Warcraft 14 hours
today it wasn't because uh only because

[07:32]
today it wasn't because uh only because
I thought it was a great game it was of
course like my escape from the outside
outside world right I think this is very
common uh I'm very happy that I chose
video games as my Escape since there are
a lot of worse ways to do this I think

[07:46]
a lot of worse ways to do this I think
um but yeah now like later in life it's
been um like before winning the manent I
knew exactly what I was doing where I
was going what my goals were how I was

[08:00]
was going what my goals were how I was
going to reach them uh I was living in a
Grindhouse in London with uh some fellow
Norwegian Pros uh shout out to prbs
Jonas and Ben uh we were living in a
Grindhouse this was during covid this
was actually like the I would say the

[08:15]
was actually like the I would say the
most formative years of my poker career
because while the world was in shutdown
and for most people this was like a
pretty traumatic time or for a lot of
people right people lost their job it
was like not a great period for the

[08:31]
was like not a great period for the
world overall uh I would say for me it
was like for my poker career at least it
was a very good time um basically I was
forced to reduce my travel to
essentially zero we were locked in in

[08:47]
essentially zero we were locked in in
this house in London where we had
nothing else to do really than work out
study and play poker that was it um so
during the co years I I would say like I
was also like living with uh prbs as I

[09:02]
was also like living with uh prbs as I
mentioned who was like one of my Idols
in the MTT world he was like always like
the best uh MTT player from Norway and
living with him and getting to talk
poker strategy with him like uh every
day um study with him and like just be

[09:16]
day um study with him and like just be
surrounded and see how him and the other
guys I was living with as well who were
all like very hard workers very hard um
yeah they had like good mindsets for
becoming s successful you know they were
they were just like every day just study

[09:31]
they were just like every day just study
play do do the right thing you know very
motivational uh crew to live with um so
during those years I improved a lot and
it was
very how to say

[09:46]
very how to say
like I like during these years I just
loved it the process you know I love the
process I had no stress no anxiety very
easy uh I would say that after the main
event my life has kind of turned upside

[10:01]
event my life has kind of turned upside
down in that sense and I've had a lot
more stress and
anxiety after winning the main which I
don't want to call it like a negative
thing it's just part of it is just what
it is and it's natural I think um of
course I'm super happy um that I want to

[10:16]
course I'm super happy um that I want to
men about it did change me in some ways
where I'm just now starting
to trying to land a bit again you know
in terms of the these anxiety levels and

[10:30]
in terms of the these anxiety levels and
stress levels and
whatever yeah so interesting right so
for you like from the outside we can see
you won the main events and all these
opportunities become available and it
seems like the dream scenario that
everyone wants but at the same time you
can see how it just changes your whole

[10:45]
can see how it just changes your whole
kind of ecosystem of life where life is
so simple you want to grind house you
play poker now it's like what do I do my
money should I invest here should I
invest there should I play this highroll
event should I all the opportunities are
available that seem like good problems
let's just overload the mind cuz there's
no clear answer it's not only that you

[11:02]
no clear answer it's not only that you
have opportunities it's also uh when
something like this happens people want
stuff from you especially like it slowed
down a lot now of course but like the
first month the first six months after

[11:15]
first month the first six months after
winning the main there was a lot of
incoming right in terms of people who
wanted your attention for uh Media stuff
or investment stuff or people just want
people just asking you for money
straight up like I got so many messages

[11:30]
straight up like I got so many messages
from people just like hey I'm going
through a tough
time my kid is sick I lost my job this
that whatever it is uh here's my account
number can you please transfer me 1K 5K

[11:45]
number can you please transfer me 1K 5K
whatever there's a lot of stuff like
this and a lot of these messages
are probably scammers who just come up
with so stories and like ask for money
some of these stories are probably
people genuinely

[12:01]
people genuinely
struggling
um I found it really tough actually
to most of it I kind of just
ignored sometimes you get messages from
like I'm from a small City in Norway you

[12:15]
like I'm from a small City in Norway you
know like 23,000 people or something
live there and I got some messages
people asking from for money from people
in my hometown people that was like
common like I look on Facebook and like
we have six common friends you know like
my mom and my uncle and you know some

[12:32]
my mom and my uncle and you know some
some stuff like this and I'm like
[ __ ] I don't know like a lot of this
stuff as well is really really hard to
decide actually like
what's yeah I don't know there's a lot

[12:46]
what's yeah I don't know there's a lot
of challenges that I hadn't foreseen um
that yeah came to the surface after
winning um that gave me both anxiety and
stress and all these things
um yeah yeah I feel anxious now just

[13:01]
um yeah yeah I feel anxious now just
talking about it honestly it's uh yeah
it is what it is um the yeah you help
the people that you um feel like you
should help like family friends and
whatever and you can't help everyone you

[13:15]
whatever and you can't help everyone you
can't answer every message that you get
and you can't even read every message
that you get uh I stopped reading these
messages for a while because it was very
similar pattern right they had lost
everything they were in very bad situ
ation can you please transfer me money

[13:31]
ation can you please transfer me money
and if you every day like just turn
through these messages you're going to
go a bit crazy I think you're not going
to be able to be happy so
