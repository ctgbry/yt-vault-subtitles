you hit the like button and also don't

[00:45]
you hit the like button and also don't
forget to subscribe to my channel so you
don't miss any future videos now this
video was motivated after a conversation
with a few players on this topic and
we're talking about what separates the
high-stakes players often from the mid
stakes players all right and often the

[01:01]
stakes players all right and often the
differences in talents aren't that great
often these players are very talented
they've got good work ethic and often
the difference is their mindset and
their attitude the way they approach the
game from mindset perspective so i was

[01:15]
game from mindset perspective so i was
thinking about this for a while and one
of the things i've noticed from working
with both mid stakes and high stakes
players for the last three four years
now
is that the high stakes players
very often have less of an ego
all right that might sound
counterintuitive because you probably

[01:30]
counterintuitive because you probably
assume that if you reach high stakes
you're this massive eagle and you're a
phil hellmuth type character who wants
to beat everyone and show good you are
that's often not true it's very often
not what i've seen the case when i work
with high stakes guys on the flip side
midstakes guys have a big ego they've

[01:46]
midstakes guys have a big ego they've
always got something to prove they
always want to be the best they always
want to get one over and or get one over
you be competitive and beat you all
right so the high sticks guys so when
i'm talking about eagle eagles basically
i want to win and i want you to lose i
want my identity to be around being the

[02:02]
want my identity to be around being the
best and winning and also it's like
protective right so chris devite means
that you're worse than me i'm better
than you the eagle puts you up and puts
other people down all right so i feel
like the mid-sticks players generally
focus way more on these attributes they

[02:16]
focus way more on these attributes they
want to beat people
and beat them down whereas high stakes
guys on the flip side of having a big
ego
they generally are just very curious all
right there are curious people and they
want to learn all right so they put the
ego one side and they go wait wait a
second i've got a big ego that's gonna

[02:30]
second i've got a big ego that's gonna
shut my doorway to learn and get better
on the flip side they actually are
curious people they just want to learn
and get better whereas on the mistakes
guys are often less curious because
they've got this ego that's just like
well i'm better than you you're worse
than me or i'm going to show you how

[02:45]
than me or i'm going to show you how
good i am as a result that shuts down
opportunities to learn all right so
this
yeah it's all kind of wrapped around the
kind of ego narrative but i think like
the high stakes players often they've
proven to themselves they're a great
player they've often got
respect of their peers if the peers they

[03:01]
respect of their peers if the peers they
care about and they're more focused on
themselves and getting better so as a
result the high-stakes players are
always able to learn they're always
looking to learn from anyone all right
so if a high-stakes player a good ics
player is playing a bad opponent he

[03:15]
player is playing a bad opponent he
doesn't shut off and go all this guy's
awful i'm just going to destroy him he's
trying to think okay he might do some
things that are counter to what the high
stakes player is used to and isaac's
fair but oh that was interesting i
wonder what i can learn from that so the
best tactics players can learn from

[03:30]
best tactics players can learn from
anyone whereas the midsix guys almost
like label people there's like you're
good you're bad and they'll learn from
the good guys who they respect but they
won't know from the guys who are quote
unquote bad all right and i pitched this
myself when i was
playing mistakes in particular i would

[03:45]
playing mistakes in particular i would
label a lot of players as good and bad
if you are good okay that was a good
good move
i can possibly learn from that but if i
had labeled someone as bad it would be
like no matter what he did i wouldn't
respect it and as a result i'd miss out
on so many opportunities because they do
things that were really good against my

[04:01]
things that were really good against my
strategy and what i should have done is
but ah maybe i don't rate this player
overall but what he did there is that
working or is it not and remove yourself
like attach yourself from the the kind
of ego and the kind of personalization
you go was that move in isolation good

[04:15]
you go was that move in isolation good
or bad against me so even if you're
playing a fish like the worst player you
could possibly play you might do a check
call check all lead all in for double
pot which might be completely out of
sync with what you're used to and what's
normal be like wait a second could that
be good

[04:30]
be good
could that work under some context could
that be good against my range right now
and think about that and be really
curious about it i feel like the high
stakes guys are much better at that than
the mistakes guys like like i said
myself i can picture when i was playing
mistakes i was quite bad at this i was
always i was unable to learn from

[04:45]
always i was unable to learn from
players who i classed as bad in all
honesty i think a lot plays the same
they almost like shut down that
that curiosity when they don't think
somebody's good they're almost like
they've almost got like a tiering system
it's like okay these guys i'm better
than so i'm just gonna beat you down and
and get good results in you these guys

[05:00]
and get good results in you these guys
are really good so i can learn from them
there's some guys in between who i can
learn from especially the high guys and
the guys all these guys i'm above or
better than
you've got nothing to teach me i want
nothing to learn from you and that's you
miss out on so much all right you miss
out on so many opportunities to to
improve and get better all right so

[05:15]
improve and get better all right so
you've got to drop the ego you better go
kid this guy i meant to respect his game
but what can i live from and everyone
every spot every opportunity every play
you're up against this opportunity to
learn all right you can learn about how
to play against their style you can
learn you can learn new new things over
and over

[05:30]
and over
i think very often we just we class all
game as good like we're the benchmark if
they play like i play like i want to
play they're good the solids if they do
things that are out of line which i
wouldn't do
he's bad all right and i picture myself
and i was battling um i was about there

[05:45]
and i was battling um i was about there
this guy has himself
and i didn't read his game and he was
doing everything which was wrong in my
opinion and i remember playing him and
i wasn't getting a result he was beating
me for like 30 40 games and i could tell
my strategy wasn't doing well against
them and i was getting so frustrated

[06:01]
them and i was getting so frustrated
because in my head i was like this guy's
bad and because he's bad
i deserve to win not because i'm
exploiting him likes him doing the right
things but because he's doing things
wrong i just win by default all right
like i'm some g2 or bot list wins by
default in reality what was happening is

[06:15]
default in reality what was happening is
he was making a lot of mistakes but i
wasn't punishing them you know the
result his mistakes were actually doing
quite good all right he had like this
massive raisin strategy pre-flop huge c
bets and i wasn't putting the pressure
on the right areas as a result it was he
was getting away with it and he's
actually doing well against me it was

[06:31]
actually doing well against me it was
that i stopped him out okay his strategy
is not very good in terms of what i
think it should be but how do i exploit
it i started thinking i need to actually
do things against that and once i
actually stopped and i after the game
and reflected i was like actually some
of the things he was doing was actually
really good and the way i was playing

[06:46]
really good and the way i was playing
against him he was actually good at good
adaptation for him to really push some
of these extreme boundaries and do
things that i was classing as really bad
it was actually working quite well
against me and that got me opened my
eyes through winter seconds how many
other players do i do this against how
many times i shut myself off from

[07:00]
many times i shut myself off from
learning because i'm i've got an ego i
think they're bad and i'm good and as a
result like i'm not learning all right
so for yourself have a think which type
of players do you learn the most from do
you learn most from the bad players or
the guys who are really good
in fact for most players that it's easy

[07:15]
in fact for most players that it's easy
to live for the good players because
like oh yeah i respect this guy he's
almost like when i'm playing him it's
almost like i get a coaching session but
the bad guys i'm like i just label them
all right so watch yourself next time
you're playing watch yourself
shut off that curiosity watch yourself
watch yourself try to label somebody's
bad

[07:30]
bad
generally when it goes to showdown on
the river the showdown happens
watch what your mind is does your mind
go oh curious what did he have there how
did he play his hand that way was that a
good move or does your mind go
idiot that was stupid why did he do that
for oh my god this guy's bad do you go

[07:45]
for oh my god this guy's bad do you go
straight to the chat and start going
idiots why do that you're so bad all
right some people would go as far as
that to like kind of type in the chat to
to to run on it all right so you find
the high stakes players do this a lot
less obviously this is a stereotype
there's gonna be some heist these guys
who have got massive egos there's gonna

[08:00]
who have got massive egos there's gonna
be some mids guys who have completely no
ego but overall i've noticed like a good
enough trend line to to create this
video on it that overall the higher
stakes guys generally have less ego and
they're more curious more open to
learning and they treat every person as
someone to learn from
and their main objective is

[08:16]
and their main objective is
how do i improve and how do i get better
that's it so when you when you've got
those your frameworks how do i improve
and how do i get better you're asking
different questions so now when someone
does something you're like oh could this
be used to help me improve my game could

[08:30]
be used to help me improve my game could
that be good could i buy it
everything's this like
curiosity box of what can i learn what
can i get better on the flip side if
you've got a big ego and you're like i'm
awesome i'm good and i'm gonna crush
everybody
then all of a sudden like you're you're
shutting down opportunities to learn
because you're not looking for it you're
literally when somebody does something

[08:46]
literally when somebody does something
you don't agree with they don't like and
they get rewarded generally they get
rewarded for it that's when it really
annoys you you get pissed off because
they shouldn't be doing this and that's
a bad move and that was that's an idiot
way to play air now the results you
missed opportunities to learn all right
so if you're missing this guy

[09:01]
so if you're missing this guy
ask yourself how can you be more curious
how can you learn from different types
of players and what you'll find is the
worst player like the cards the worst
the players who you label as bad are not
good that you're generally shooting that
opportunity to learn from right it's all
coming from your ego and you wanted to
be right and you wanted to uh um yeah

[09:16]
be right and you wanted to uh um yeah
have the dominance over them all right
guys so uh going forward if you are
mistakes guy watch this observe it ask
yourself how you can be more curious how
you can do learning if you're a high
stakes guy let me know if this resonate
with you as well if you are someone who
you feel is always curious if you've

[09:30]
you feel is always curious if you've
actually noticed this trendline yourself
i've noticed this in dozens and dozens
of players now so i thought it would be
worth letting you guys know about it so
let me know if you guys agree on it and
