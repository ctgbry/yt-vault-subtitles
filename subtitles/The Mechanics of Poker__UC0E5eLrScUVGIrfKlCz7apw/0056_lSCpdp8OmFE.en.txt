[00:00]
i don't think batting small is really a
thing here on the blank yeah and he did
decide to go for an over bet again so we
have over bet over bed now a very strong
line taken by luke

[00:18]
do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a
free one hour demo hi there fellow
poker players and welcome back to
another video here at the poker ambition

[00:31]
another video here at the poker ambition
channel
in which today we are going to be
railing some high
stakes poker i was taking a look at a
couple of games
running at gg kind of preparing myself
for
when we move up again and i thought it

[00:45]
when we move up again and i thought it
would be a good idea to
kind of take you guys along while i reel
the game
as always if you like this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up
if you have any questions about hands
that were played or any suggestions for
the players that
played the hands that they played any

[01:02]
played the hands that they played any
suggestions for the players that played
the hand write them down below
any suggestions for me before i jump
into those games
also write them down below make sure
also to follow the channel as we will be
releasing more content like this very
soon

[01:15]
soon
and without further ado let's take a
look at who we have at the tables
i see mr limitless well known of course
i see hey rodriguez from mexico
limitless from macau in this case we
have the chinese
player wjhh888

[01:33]
player wjhh888
maybe he used to play on 88 but switch
to gg and i think this is the
recreational
uh at the table we have kevin pacquiao
luke
gillis guys that i know and we have a
constant tin

[01:45]
constant tin
which i don't really know looks like he
has a turkish flag if i'm not mistaking
h rodriguez i'm also not really sure who
that is
like i said i've just been starting to
follow these games a little bit
uh most familiar i would say with
luchilus and
uh and limitless so without further ado

[02:02]
uh and limitless so without further ado
guys let's see
the action that will develop
so in this first hand limitless opens
the
cutoff and luke defense in a big blind
limitless scene that's for our one-third

[02:16]
limitless scene that's for our one-third
sizing which i think is gonna be the
majority
uh of hands that are gonna get into the
sizing you could make an argument for
having a couple of big bets on this
board as well but i think just c bearing
quite a lot for one third sizing is fine

[02:30]
quite a lot for one third sizing is fine
luke is going to respond by calling
checks the turn don't think this is
eternal you should ever be leading and
now it's off to limitless
i think it's a spot that he's probably
going to
um not bad at a very high frequency

[02:46]
um not bad at a very high frequency
and i expect to see quite a lot of over
batch
not too big though i would say like a
slight over bet is probably the
preferred sizing
you could also make an argument for
adding in a small sizing and using a
split so i see some hands that might

[03:00]
split so i see some hands that might
benefit from
half bought three quarters and some
other hands that benefit from over bet
however i would say when we get into
earlier positions i think the
three-quarter sizing is or the only
sizing that we're gonna use
or it's gonna be less dominant than the

[03:15]
or it's gonna be less dominant than the
over bet
compared to let's say if we're on the
button i think on the button a split is
definitely a must
limitless checks back and now it's up to
luke in the big blind
on a river six again there's definitely
you think a difference how you play this

[03:30]
you think a difference how you play this
spot
if you're epmp cutoff compared to if
you're on the button on the button i
would like to see you do quite a lot of
blocking
uh when the rangers get tighter i think
we still do quite a lot of blocking but
a little bit less with weaker hands like

[03:45]
a little bit less with weaker hands like
a weak seven for example is a fine hand
to make a small bat now when you're
playing versus the button but it gets a
little bit dicey versus earlier
positions
um i think eights is a hand that luke
should definitely now be betting for a
small sizing same with nines
and there probably are a couple of hands

[04:01]
and there probably are a couple of hands
that just wanted to fire out one big bet
now
uh hand like king queen for example i
think it's a good hand to now but like
three quarters pot so probably again a
mix
i would say luke actually decides to
check

[04:15]
check
and now it's up to limitless so luke's
most likely holding right now is
probably something like a weak ish pair
maybe an ace jack high that he float the
flop with like ace jack with a diamond
for
example could also i like to bluff that

[04:31]
example could also i like to bluff that
hand so i think it's
more likely that luke probably has some
sort of showdom value
and my i think most likely is that he
probably has a pair
yeah just a one pair type of hand or a
hand that he
maybe wanted to check raise with let's

[04:46]
maybe wanted to check raise with let's
say a hand like seven
six would make maybe sense to go for a
check race
or obviously a five but i think a five
is a bit if you have like a naked five
let's say has ace five and diamonds i
think it's a bit more ace five of clubs
i think it's a bit more likely that

[05:00]
i think it's a bit more likely that
those hands would be just betting small
now it's up to limitless so yeah i said
like i said i think
luke has quite a lot of made hands here
and
not a lot of uh air if limbless would

[05:15]
not a lot of uh air if limbless would
not bat
which i think he is very plausible with
like the medium portion of his range
he could definitely be checking back
queen jack queen 10 type of holdings on
the turn
uh he's going to have jack's tents don't
think he has a lot of
very strong hands so i would not like to

[05:32]
very strong hands so i would not like to
see very big sizing
maybe like a half pot sizing here for
limitless i think would make sense
targeting a lot of the weaker hands that
i just discussed that luke has
limitless checks behind luke indeed

[05:46]
limitless checks behind luke indeed
shows up with a 7
as we kind of expected and limitless it
gave up
the jack tin

[06:00]
but off on the side i do understand his
give up like i said
ace jack or ace 10 maybe with the ace of
diamonds i think are very likely check
folds for
for luke so he's kind of blocking his
faults
um i think maybe he recognized that luke

[06:15]
um i think maybe he recognized that luke
in this spot probably
then has quite a lot of one pairs and
then it's just a matter of is he going
to fold those but like i said i don't
think it's
a great hand to be bluffing with okay
in the next hand we see luke mixing it

[06:31]
in the next hand we see luke mixing it
up with a little limpy limp olympia
under the gun
kevin completes in the small blind and
mr kunsan team decides to go for a check
it's checked around to luke luke
pets don't really know how his limping

[06:45]
pets don't really know how his limping
range will look
but it's definitely a very creative play
a creative strategy which i've seen
used before i've also used limping
strategies
in certain situations i think it
definitely is beneficial
but it depends on a lot of factors right

[07:02]
but it depends on a lot of factors right
so in general here now luke
you could say has sort of an advantage
uh
both players that have limped in
especially the big blind just has
so much air that if we bet small there's
really not much he can do

[07:16]
really not much he can do
especially also looking ahead if
broadway's come in
there's a chance that luke might have
limped a hand like king queen
and constantine if he's in the big
blinds and small but completes is way
more likely to raise ant like king queen

[07:30]
more likely to raise ant like king queen
so let's say for example
10 rolls off a queen or a king uh we get
into a situation where i think luke will
have the ranged advantage
that he can put quite a lot of pressure
on and actually the king does roll off
and this is i think one of those
situations if you look at constantine
for example he still hasn't had like six

[07:46]
for example he still hasn't had like six
deuce off suit
that is gonna be in quite some trouble
facing bats
luke actually decides to go for a quite
a hefty bet even
it's an overbet and now it's up to
constantine
who i think is now in quite

[08:02]
who i think is now in quite
a tough spot uh with
a very big part of his range so that's i
like the play
of luke i don't think we should only
have an over bed range here i think
this is definitely a spot where we
should be splitting but there's

[08:15]
should be splitting but there's
definitely certain hands that might
benefit
from an over bet
constantine goes in the tank and this is
a very tough spot obviously you want to
be defending like your hands like queen
nine ten all these hands that have a
purpose some potential

[08:30]
purpose some potential
it kind of also depends how wide you
think luke is but i don't think we have
to defend here with
uh like a naked six or a naked nine or
even a naked
jack so i would probably just defend if
i had a hand like 910 queen 9 jack 10
um maybe you turned king with king 10

[08:45]
um maybe you turned king with king 10
off suit or something like that
now it's up to luke so constantly didn't
he decide to call the river blanks
um so i think luke is definitely still
in the advantage in general and i would

[09:00]
in the advantage in general and i would
expect
to see another big bat if we do the site
too bad i don't think batting small is
really a thing here
on the blank yeah and he did decide to
go for an over bet again so we have over
bet over bed now a very strong line
taken by luke
and constantine is in some trouble

[09:17]
and constantine is in some trouble
and the problem here for constantine is
that he has a lot of hands
that are sort of similar in terms of
strength for bluff catching
for example you can have like 910 and
queen 9. they're both very similar same

[09:31]
queen 9. they're both very similar same
with jack 10 jack queen
both very similar would almost say king
10 is sort of the same
depending on how luke plays ace king or
king queen
um so i would say yeah if i have a king
i would call
and then like the other hands in the

[09:46]
and then like the other hands in the
middle region
um it really depends on your reader your
opponent if you want to play correct i
would say we have to call them with a
certain frequency
um this is actually probably a spot
where a solver would
call with a diamond as in positions look

[10:00]
call with a diamond as in positions look
most likely to give
up with a diamond so let's say we have
910 with the 10 of diamonds
it's more likely that a solver would
call that hand
whereas maybe in practice if people do
bluff a flush draw you don't want to
have a diamond in your hand

[10:16]
constantine goes in the tank and he
calls
with king nine which is two pair and
luke does show up with a better hand
in pocket jack so he made a little
chappy trapping limp on the gun
uh constantine i think yeah i think he
just has a call but as you can see he

[10:31]
just has a call but as you can see he
was even thinking about it with this
hand
uh maybe he thought his hands were
already a bluff catcher
i think that's a bit too pessimistic i
think if luke had a hand like king
knight himself
or had like jack 9 he could definitely
play it in a similar fashion

[10:46]
play it in a similar fashion
so i would say king nine is just a call
maybe he was debating if king 10 is a
better call
that would be the case if luke is really
polarizing if he thinks luke is really
polarizing towards king jack plus and a
straight then king 10 would be a better
call than king 9.

[11:01]
call than king 9.
[Music]
limitless opens the button kevin gets
out of the way
and constantine goes in for a 3-bet up
to
limitless who does make the call flops

[11:15]
limitless who does make the call flops
king 3 deuce
it's going to be a high c bet frequency
for constantine for a one-third sizing
that makes sense again there's maybe a
couple of hands that
you might want to implement a bigger
sizing but i don't think that's really
necessary
on this board yes it's gonna be just
such such a small frequency of hands

[11:32]
such such a small frequency of hands
that want to do this
turn is a queen and this is a um
this is a very good turn in general for
constantine
adds limitless will have quite a lot of
pairs that constantine won't have so
mainly the

[11:45]
mainly the
the fours the the fives the sixes
the sevenths and even the eights at some
frequency they make up for quite a lot
of combinations
um and they're all hands that uh
limitless will have that constantine
won't have also constantine will have
improved

[12:00]
improved
in the top region so i think this is a
spot where constantine can
put in quite a lot of pressure there's
not a lot of hands for consulting that i
think benefit from checking
jack's tenth nines would be like the
first hand that kind of pop up in my
head
a hand that is fine to give up is maybe

[12:16]
a hand that is fine to give up is maybe
hand like ace eight of spades
uh ace nine of spades if he decided to
three bet that but other than that i
would expect to see
quite a high bearing frequency from
constantine
do you want to better know how to
construct your turn barreling ranges in

[12:31]
construct your turn barreling ranges in
three web pots
i recently made a master class how to
play three web pods out of position so
go over to the side click on the master
class and
also there you can see a free 30-minute
demo
of what is inside the master class

[12:47]
of what is inside the master class
so constantine does indeed barrel a half
pot and this is a very tough spot for
limitless to defend um
in terms of paris i think if we have a
hand like

[13:00]
hand like
eights or sevens with a diamond
i think those would be pairs that we
could probably still defend
other than that we have a couple of
natural defense like if we floated ace
jack or ace ten on the flop
uh same way they had like 10 jack if
we've loaded that on flop i think h5

[13:15]
we've loaded that on flop i think h5
is for if we hadn't had like a street
suited i think it's still called four or
five suited probably still
call five six suited
probably still calling um and other than
that yeah like i said we just have a lot
of these pairs that we're not gonna fold

[13:30]
of these pairs that we're not gonna fold
uh we're just gonna continue with draws
and i would say queen x plus and then i
think seventh and eighths exactly with a
diamond would be maybe paris if we could
consider defending again
river 10 pot is now 28k and i was up to

[13:46]
river 10 pot is now 28k and i was up to
constantine
interesting run out um think ace jack
the benefits are quite divided i don't
think
limitless is always calling ace jack off
don't think constantine is always three
betting ace jack off
ajax suited i think are in both players

[14:02]
ajax suited i think are in both players
as rangers so
i think that kind of goes both ways same
with the hand like king queen
tense i think is not in either of the
ranges
king 10 suited could be both in range so
i think in general the 10 doesn't really

[14:15]
i think in general the 10 doesn't really
change much
uh constantine had already already had
the range advantage
uh in terms of ace king aces queens
kings so i think constantine is just
gonna
fire off quite often
and then for limitless there's again

[14:31]
and then for limitless there's again
not a lot that he can do i think he
should just call down with his king
um and then you have a couple of other
good bluff catchers which are going to
be
queen jack suited or ace queen probably
gonna get called with a certain
frequency

[14:47]
because it injects which is quite
interesting i think if he did have a
bluff he will probably follow through
unless he has like the worst type of
bluff which is ace five of diamonds i
guess
but then again ace five diamonds also
you could make an argument while we're

[15:00]
you could make an argument while we're
um we're blocking asia diamonds but i
think we're blocking way more folds in
ace a2 that
h9 suited so i think that's a fine give
up for constantine we're also back and
like five four suited
now it's up to limitless and i think
limitless is just going to
um bluff his air okay this is

[15:18]
um bluff his air okay this is
this makes a lot of sense i'm curious
what he would do with the hand like
sevens and eights because
there are maybe a little bit a couple of
benefits so let's say
constantine did re river had like a

[15:30]
constantine did re river had like a
stance suited to eject and suited we
might be able to block them off that
hand
but sevens and eights do have some sort
of value versus
uh versus draws that gave up so i
wouldn't mind checking back either
limitless now shifts it in when we have
a snap fold from constantine i think

[15:46]
a snap fold from constantine i think
this is a spot where people
don't really have too much hands if they
play the hand correctly
that are going to be now in a tough spot
facing a bet i think a lot of hands that
were in a tough spot facing a bet would
have probably bet themselves
so i think he just had to give up that

[16:02]
so i think he just had to give up that
yeah he didn't really have much of the
decision
if he would be thinking i think like i
said his most likely holding would be
a 10 or maybe a
turn or maybe a screen on the turn that
he decided to barrel that would be an

[16:15]
he decided to barrel that would be an
option as well
look opens from the cutoff the
recreational calls in the big
in a small blind check check
could actually be a spot where both

[16:31]
could actually be a spot where both
players could have some sort of a
leading range
up to luku i don't think he's gonna see
that all that often he does see that one
third sizing
the recreation will get out of the way
which i'm quite surprised usually in

[16:45]
which i'm quite surprised usually in
these low boards if you're a
recreational player
not actually not even if you're a
recreational player also if you're a
professional player
there's hands that there's quite a lot
of hands that have potential right any
any two over
some sort of potential and if you have a
lower card you have a gutter with it
or a pair so it's usually not really a

[17:02]
or a pair so it's usually not really a
board
that you expect a lot of fault equity on
if
you are loot
so limitless comes in for the call board
is quite
drawing so let's see what luke does he

[17:15]
drawing so let's see what luke does he
goes for a three-quarter issue
bet and now it's up to limitless
who didn't check raise the flop versus
one third which
i thought was interesting i think his
most likely holding is just a naked
eight or naked
five and make it a naked naked9 um

[17:32]
five and make it a naked naked9 um
i think a lot of his draws benefits from
track racing kind of depends also how he
sees
how he perceives luke's c betting range
here if he's going to see that a lot or
not
like i said i think it's an option for
limitless to maybe lead out with some

[17:46]
limitless to maybe lead out with some
straight draws
as we discussed in our dunk bedding
video if you haven't seen that one go
check that out
rivers and ace which is an interesting
card
i think it probably benefits limitless a

[18:01]
i think it probably benefits limitless a
little bit more as like i said i think
he could play a hand like
uh h8 h9 is 10 with a heart or something
this way
and i don't think lucas is gonna have a
lot of aces in his range
unless it's something with the ace of
hearts

[18:15]
hearts
um i think luke's most likely holding is
just having a strong hand an overpair
or he was trying to bluff limitless with
a hand like king jack king queen
luke decides to check and he actually

[18:30]
luke decides to check and he actually
shows up with the ace queen which i
actually think was unexpected i would
have actually expected him to check
and limitless shows up with the draw
that i think
he could decide to lead out himself on
the flop
and could check raise the flop as well

[18:46]
and could check raise the flop as well
if he doesn't lead out
i think both hands could have been
played differently
but at least you know looks like he's a
social guy
and he apologizes to limitless
