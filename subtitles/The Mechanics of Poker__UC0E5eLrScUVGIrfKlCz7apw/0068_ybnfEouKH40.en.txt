mechanics of poker
program also make sure to join our
discord channel and
sign up to our newsletter so you don't
miss out on any
new promotions pokerstars is still
trying to figure out if i'm
real flash or a gto but well you know
gto human being they told me that they
would have had it figured out this week
estimation 25th so that's when we can
start playing again
but i figured you know don't want to
leave you guys hanging with nothing
i do obviously know that i think these
kind of streams
certain people like this more but the
majority obviously
would like live streams i personally
like the mix up
like this has already been out the fifth
time ever review something i would have
also
i would have actually also preferred
playing but
we're gonna do one more uh replay
i've also been talking around for some
guest appearances which will
appear on the stream very soon as well i
like guest appearances on this kind of
concepts so that's i think
where we're kind of going combining live
play
with railing and then possible
guests i think that will have a nice
a nice vibe to it all right today guys
what we got in store is mr helmets mr
linus love as always align is not always
in the mix and mr dex
8088 we're gonna try to figure out what
these guys have and what they're up to
and why it's so good as always i see 2.5
axing which
you know the most used the most common
sizing in cash games three bed sizing
usually
11 and 12 from the big blind this is
something that we
see over and over and over we usually
see three acting from the small blind
and we usually see limping
and limping mainly because we're playing
higher stakes so rake is not really
relevant
same with small blind calling especially
lioness we see this doing
quite often limping small blind doing a
lot of calling
3 6 queen is a board that i think linus
is going to be checking at a decent
frequency
probably more checks than bats i would
say it starts off with a bat
okay so we can already eliminate certain
hands from his range the deuce rolls up
on the turn which is a
improving card for decks as linus
would probably not have limped a hand
like
what is now a straight 4-5 off suit
no probably not and dex could definitely
have four or five off so the same with
three dudes after the sticks do soft
windows off suit um so i would expect a
check from linus or a small bat
he goes indeed for the check now it is
actually interesting spot this is
actually a spot that i was
working on an hour ago in the master
class playing small versus big blind
i was focused on stingray spots but as i
will also explain
in the master class it's the philosophy
behind how to play small blind out of
position versus the big blind whether
you play limp pods sing right spots
it's very similar in the end all
all spots play similar from a certain
philosophy
but obviously range interactions text
sizes sprs they change and therefore we
have a different strategy
so here like i said if the deuce tree
offers indexes range and the four five
off which is the linuses range usually
that means
you're gonna slow down a little bit and
now
the amount of betting dex wants to do
is dependent on how often linus has
bet the flop with his air
he goes for a big bet which i think
given how i think lioness plays uh is a
fine strategy i think we could even
implement bigger bets uh i would say
if lioness place is bored correctly i
would say that on the turn i would
prefer
checking a bit more and increasing my
bet sizing
line is thinking about it as like like i
said i think he's not going to just
randomly bet this fluff with air
so he check folded a handy goodie check
folded seven eight
first hand that can pop up in my head a
hand that can bet the flop that can
sometimes turn
some gutters on a four and a five a nine
or in a pair
make a hand like eight ten fold on the
flop so
i think that's kind of the most likely
hint okay limp call king queen 9
interesting
should connect fairly well with linus's
limb calling range
linus one set yeah i also prefer three
four-handed
300 is my favorite then 400 then 500
10 600 no no actually oh 300 and then
maybe 600
400 yeah 300 600 400 500
that's i guess my my uh my preference in
that order
interesting spot here for linus i have
my
ideas about this spot that um
don't think i'm going to
share let's see what linus does
how he approaches this spot he doesn't
think about it it's interesting
i mean it's a very good board for linus
compared to dax
you just go for a check in the end seems
like he's thinking about if he should
bluff ace jack or nut or a s10 something
like that
or that or if he should value bad a
queen
now i think a queen i would say checks
faster so i will go for ace jack
and dex comes up with a off
part a little bit more it's a bit of a
weird
a weird bet i don't really know what's
going on but if i'm linus i would be
curious
it's interesting also right that linus
thought about it for so long before
checking this also i think
depending on what other tables he plays
if he's only playing these two tables i
think doesn't reveal something about the
strength of his hand like i said ace
jack
ace ten
or in general one ace high he decides
not to call
he's a little bit fishy guys whoa
what do you think dex has here so he he
raises the limp
seabeds flopped one third check check
nine uh he's saying basically he has end
like king five off
you know it could be one of these bit
more polarizing hands that he could
raise with preflop
ace nine suited yeah that's that's
definitely an option
but then again would you see that that
on the flop
like it doesn't really open much jack
9 for example jack 9 off suit is not a
hand that you're going to race the small
blinds
limp with all that often yeah
okay so i guess ace nine suited which
you could also check back
unless you have ace nine of hearts but
that's also not possible
is nine off i guess king five off
i don't know it smells a little bit
fishy do you want to have a better
understanding of what's going on in
these videos
in our mechanics of poker program we
focus on when and why certain strategy
generates highest ev and how to perform
more consistently at the poker tables
so you can get a deeper understanding of
how poker really works
and how to get more success in poker so

dollar worth of value go over to the

program
actually i used to already i've been
making master classes way before
pokemission even started
it's just the way i like teaching i
would definitely advocate this to others
as well if you're
trying to fix the leaks leaks in your
game or if you're trying to study
study in a way that you've that pretend
like you're going to have to share that
with other people so you have to teach
it so you have to be able to explain it
because
that's a form of learning that will
strengthen your knowledge
one of the reasons for example i started
coaching as well because i saw extra
benefits in terms of
also getting better myself okay we got a
betcha bat small sizing here from
helmets which
is a good strategy you know we like
we like the little batsa we like the
little beds just like negroni those very
unicorns i like this bed a lot too this
is really
really kind of sexy really kind of sexy
sexy sexy sexy sexy this is one of these
bats where you're like okay i bet this
good luck
linus line is not digging into
the hands he has to call with comes up
with a raise queen four of hearts for
linus
we will never know and this is something
that you will see quite often at higher
stakes you will see
higher aggression for lower sizings as
well with the raises as the bats
smaller first big brand right off but on
the flop
i expected to just to follow up for
another small sizing
over bet on this turn i don't know i i i
don't really feel it
people underestimate how either was it
online poker he was winning for his bet
on a poke
i have no clue about ivy's game so
that's gonna not gonna judge
they're quite a sick talent yeah that's
for sure i mean obviously the guy is
very talented at the game has a lot of
experience
lioness calls and here we have the over
bat what do you guys think of the over
bet jack five
jack jacks moment versus big blind the
ground is not probably near world class
and heads up and now after the match i
think
world class that i don't know but
i mean i i assume he learned quite a lot
so that's why i would now rate him
higher as way more online experience at
the moment
eight eight i'm calling it okay we have
one
we have one for pocket eights for for mr
helmets
it's interesting intuitively i feel like
this is a bit too much
but my natural bias is also that i lean
towards small sizes a bit too often in
spots where we can actually go a little
bit bigger
so taking that bias in consideration the
five pairs
which doesn't change much but it does
hey yeah if helmets would have had like
bucket deuces on the turn which i think
is actually a fine barrel
for that sizing then obviously is now
counterfeited
but it mainly reduces the number of full
houses linus has so let's say we had a
value hand
uh it's not less likely that linus has
something
to call you with basically i think i
think
we don't need to use big sizings here in
my opinion too too big of a sizing
but yeah i guess i guess a couple of
hands do want a bit big and then mainly
uh
jack so he goes right over bet again
he's really saying he has a jack or he's
blocking a jack
how can we block a jack again like 9 10
9 10 i think is a fine barrel on the
turn
910 doesn't depending on your suits it
doesn't really block
him having a five he doesn't block any
queen high skiing is highs and i block
some jackax
a six six plus is since is very loose
oh [ __ ] fights for lightest let's go
let's go let's go
and i don't i assume we don't get a tank
here it is just tanking his line is just
the pocket fives
and helmets the jack let's see depending
on the sizing we can see how polarized
he went
or at least in this hand he's thinking
about it
he's thinking about it it's it's it's
quite hard
like i see someone play saying 66 plus
if you put over bit over bad pressure
with six six plus i mean he still has
all jacks uh if you have two sixes
he would need to have he would need to
call you down with a lot of
ace six type of holdings if you want to
go overboard over between sixes
i know maybe solver does it but i would
say intuitively don't follow it
intuitively it feels like too much
pressure but apparently he did have
a tin each value hand blast for linus i
don't even know
uh uh where they started but i would say
actually a five doesn't really matter
because he never has
a five or pocket fives
i guess if you're a lioness you want to
block a jack like king queen or
something
for lightness
ace 10 versus pocket eights
damn
damn what the [ __ ]
okay so helmets did go
you know a little bit of the higher side
i know
i don't really like the tent if i'm in
line issues i think it blocks so much of
his
of his bluffs
what the [ __ ]
next level stuff guys [ __ ] it eights
align is bluffing there with the a7 guys
if anyone at your limit gems there you
have pocket dates please fold
that's that's some next level [ __ ]
that's some next level [ __ ] so for
a pot a little better on the flop which
is quite standard
and we got a call from helmuts so we can
already do
the doctor i think some hands from
helmut's range
say it's quite uh it's actually a spot
where you should
fast play um
pocket aces for example in general you
you
should fast play pocket aces way more
information people actually do
in theory yeah that is uh i personally
still would slow play aces
don't tell anyone we get a check call
check call
like i said helmuts i think was most
likely drawing
trapping or just having ace queen high
and it's now gonna come in bluff catch
world
decks should be bluffing hands that
don't have a heart
and i saw a snap also draw and the queen
having a queen or an ace is interesting
because that kind of depends on if he
calls ace queen or not if he sees ace
queen as a call or as a fault
if he sees it as a call then blocking
ace queen is good if cc has vault the
block a squid is not so good but
definitely don't have a heart
ah limp okay betty betty
over betty
actually you don't limb pots there's
less overbearing going on so let's see
yeah pot
snap call dex had no decision
interesting run out
like queen jack king 10 hence that dex
could be racing
against the limp and obviously lion is
still having
the ace x advantage which is very valid
on this board
i expect a big bet
quarters and a snap fold so uh
dex was probably drawing
dex needed chicken song for the check
folder on the turnout okay guys okay
guys you get what you want
[Music]
a little chicken song for the fans and
this guy is putting on the pressure
maximum pressure 8.8k down the middle
and basically saying yes queen 10
actually you could still also have
a set for example i think that's still
valid
as well then preferably kings or aces
no not kings or aces
jacks or nines because we want lioness
to call with ace queen ace 10
these type of holdings
but i don't think we will get a call oh
he's snap calls with king nine
so yes indeed has pocket aces this is a
very interesting call on the river
um why is this an interesting call on
the river
i'm gonna ask you guys
like asus i think is a great gem
actually actually no i don't think
like i said i would prefer to have a
different set but you know
now you're not doing it wrong if you go
for two for example i also go for three
quarters over but in a lot of spots but
there are some spots where i think pot
makes sense
uh this is then also certain hands
intuitively come into a pot because
you're like yeah too big for an over but
that's a small first three quarters
again and pot
intuitively makes the most sense shout
out to charlie carroll for playing
intuitive poker
they don't find the pop bets because
they're wrong at 7 50. yeah that's true
but i mean then you usually see a lot of
spots that some hands want the battery
quarters some answer ones go at
bet over butter yeah you can merge that
to pot but
what do you think is a losing player on
that game
i i don't know
i don't i don't know decks well enough
but i would just
go for a line as big as winner and the
other two they don't like money
and they just like the challenge doesn't
matter what sizes
you use that much more important is your
frequency in relation with
opponent frequency that's very true
was this tree bet no it was bad by bad
shelf do you want the 80 damage when you
jam
aces
i would have exactly so in general aces
like you're way more likely to shove
nines than pocket aces right i think
with pocket aces maybe
your value should come from betting a
little bit smaller
maybe making him bluff jam jack 10 for
example i think
that would be especially with these aces
especially having the ace of diamond i
think that's a more plausible line
but then again we do see lions actually
calling quite quickly with the king 9.
why is the king nine call so interesting
lions gave me money to be ending gay i
agree
i would really question these guys play
for real and not swap the losses and we
accepted just to start the game and paid
some casuals no that's definitely not
happening man
rich to care about money it was raised
one third spot turn
jam river cut-off versus big no what is
it button
hey oh wait actually though the hand
went completely different
it went iso oh
okay and does it actually doesn't really
change much
the the ranges remain quite equally it
would have been different if he would
have been around that race
so we gotta put it for the people who
are holding timing tails so let's replay
the hand
it's actually also gonna be the last
hand of the stream
to get ready for my dinner with the one
and only otb any questions guys
for mr odb you can ask me
i'll probably not ask him as he will
probably not answer them so yeah
make a it's
gonna be an interesting conversation so
yeah the limp call
the pot turn now this this
does it does change it does change
things a little bit
if you're in linus shoes in terms of
calling compared to if you would have
raised
the button or the cutoff
as the big blinds range is a little bit
more polarized so
there can be your random queen for
offsuit
sometimes so that does make the call
a little bit more feasible
but why in general is king nine a little
bit of a
funky call that was the question to the
