poker poker poker poker how did that
work again
german in the house
oh man i haven't played poke in a little
while
actually that's not true what's what is
a little wow
i mean what is a little wow
a week
who else has that if you don't play
poker for a week you feel like you
forgot everything
and maybe your week is a bit exaggerated
but uh
you get my point to get my point i'm
playing then two tables for now
let's see how that goes
[Music]
popping flush draws and getting there
seems like a good strategy
i think i'll definitely have some leads
here on this turn and definitely think
of some hands
it's definitely eternity should be pot
controlling on quite hard
this is a bit of a bad river
in terms of
my bluffs
i mean i do stuff maybe like queen
no that's a good first hand
that's a very good first hand that's how
we like to start sessions
i mean if we do have the queen
of diamonds and the nine for example i
think it's a fine hand to uh
to shove
shove to shove
a little donkey donkey
and also we have a 10 10 20 table
because
i'm going to be mixing here on the turn
i think queen nine
it's mine for a block again
it's close i think if i have k9
or ace nine would definitely start
building big this one's quite close
i can do two things here
i'm gonna go for the block
especially having the nine of clubs i
could also check call
i would much rather block a jack nine
and check off queen nine for example
but it's getting quite close and then
you know then the the diamond left me to
make the bat
let's try a little donkey why not
we're stretching it a little bit here
but
fine hand
this does not kind of suck
it's a very good card though for my
range
and i think if we check we probably
have a check fold
as this main blocks are going to come
from king x hands like king queen king
jack
and
as we all know i don't really like the
fault so that's why i was considering
betting
but you know you should not bet just to
avoid a certain line
i think the river is a clear check
i think king queen king jack is probably
gonna bet the turn
meaning that
the river is main blocks are going to be
probably ace heights like ace jack ace
queen is king
they had like five four so actually i
don't mind my hand as a hero call
every blocking head like king ten for
example hey wacko i started using gta
wizard because of you okay thank you
very much all of the two was wondering
what is your score of correct place in
the program and average ev loss you mean
when evaluating hands because i don't
evaluate full sessions i just only put
in my marked hands
you should ask
cg
i know he
puts his full sessions in there
i'm gonna call forward there with king
queen
poppy king
easy call
i'm gonna have to do quite a lot of
folding though
and definitely going to bed the turn i
think there are still plenty of hands to
get value from queens
worse king axe worst jackax
ambassador i'm just going to call
and
obviously just call down
but it's a very bad river
because i think a lot of his bluffs are
going to contain an ace
so yeah that's obviously not great
okay actually checks
probably not good news because i
expected if i'm uh
if i'm not bt you would probably bluff
so
yeah exactly that is quite [ __ ] up
okay guys we have
a table here
but i was probably gonna lose that hand
regardless
he checks because he has a jack to go
with his hand he would for example not
check if he would have revert a
different ace i guess
here i get three bet with the jack 10
i'm going to call
f6 obviously calling here flop a set set
ain't bad that's my motto i started with
a bet
five six
seven and nine i turn on the lower side
i'm just going to fold
now if i should jam
i think the thing kind of goes both ways
i'm gonna go for a fault do you want to
make 2022
your greatest poker year ever
now i've done a webinar on how to do
that in our academy which we have made
available completely for free so go over
to pokerambition.com
and let me help you achieve your goals
also mixing a caller with the ace deuce
it's a very good flop from my range
same here
so i'm just gonna bet
here i'm going to check fold the turn we
didn't turn any equity straight flush
came in
we block a lot of his turn faults which
are going to be eight highs
here with pocket threes i'm going to bet
big
this is a very bad turn
with the aces
i am going to check we are not blocking
any of the ace jack suited that's going
to make a huge difference in the 4 by
pot
just going to check for the ace deuce
and you should probably now turn some
hands into a bluff
especially asa i i have like the worst
hand ever
but then again it's just a very bad spot
in general i would say
he goes for a block
i think we're forced to call but i'm not
very happy about it
oh
rocket asus a new 510 table starts and
we get aces straight away that's good
we already made the guy warm
um i'm definitely going to bet the
reverse still i would say even though
king jack now did make a straight
it's close i'm still going to go for it
i'm going to check the aces with both
these suits specifically
he called him mocked he had to pair wow
what a flop what a flop
and we get a bet with the
pocket aces which is splendid splendid
stuff as they say in england go to call
you're going to check
i'm going to erase this
i'm going to definitely go in here let
me see
yeah i think that's okay
we had
here we have aces in a bomb bot with the
ace of spades i think i'm going to check
there's a recreational here
and i usually like
to check towards
the recreation on these kind of
scenarios
over here i'm going to jam the river
check again obviously with aces when the
temperatures
defaults okay okay okay very strong and
aggressive play
incredibly strong and aggressive play
should really stop
stop showing all these blossom stream
it's a weird spot when he calls but i
think we cannot really race
and here
there's the jared
we decided to potty gems
the weird spot i think we have to call
i'm not happy about it
okay as i said
i think without a spade we have to call
but exactly kings
and here now i think we have a check and
then
reevaluate the situation
and they had six three and five eight
that is why i like to check towards the
recreation on that spot so yeah i
definitely have some tips
be very conscious about
what your goals are in poker
for example i was sort of
unconsciously trying to prove that i
could beat
someone so for me this mainly happened
uh in three-handed games 400 games
like quitting and i was trying to beat
beat someone so as soon as that then
happened okay so i was playing a bad one
i was up a couple of binds
yeah basically my goal was achieved i
wasn't playing there for out let's say
for example you're just an ev grinder
you're like oh this is a very good 3 to
400 game making a lot of money
here and my goal is to make a lot of
money so obviously you know i continue
right that's quite uh
it's quite straightforward then you will
continue but since that was not really
my goal or at least unconsciously it
wasn't
i would then quit so realize like what
your goals are
i think it's very important
object and i'll start off with a bet
and then go and check all modis later
think
it's also bad again
rf is go
could you even do something funky
no i don't think so at this end
and i think we have an easy go on the
river
even though
you could make an argument
that
the 10 blocks more bluffs than it does
value
ace tank king 10
but i think not having a queen or a king
mainly a queen as you can see the ice
queen
too bad for us you rolled low
chicken song man guys come on little
chicken song here for uh for german i
didn't think
sad times did it come to this that i
have to play the ticket song for the
german
very sad
this is what poker is coming to guys
[Music]
this is what poker has become to play
chicken sound for the girl man that's a
saddle right
i can actually sometimes have the
tendency to slow play this
very sometimes
am i gonna do it now yeah [ __ ] it we're
gonna do it none of this is good but
some with top set i always have that
that urge especially when the board is
so
so dry like it is now
cuz you're gonna do it
again this is uh
as uh
as our good friend uh nick howe would
say i think it's a really unorthodox
unconventional way for him to play a set
okay but uh
mr howard
now this guy is river the king we're
gonna extract some value
definitely going to mark this hand
i sometimes have this i i tell myself i
shouldn't do
this kind of funky stuff but sometimes i
just cannot help myself
that is because you know
basically then usually what you should
do is off game you should say like to
overwrite
the need to play a hand too funky
because apparently
what you
how you perceive that spot in game is
different
okay guys we're going to win pocket
queens i seriously because queens are i
love yesterday everything with queens he
raised he had he brought no king races
we we're all in baby we're all in this
is it this is a big moment of truth this
is it
either we wing everything or we lose
everything but we come on baby there we
go tense is a good hand for us
no
no what the [ __ ] [ __ ]
the [ __ ] [ __ ]
i lost everything
the true outcome guys the true outcome
what is the true
outcome what is the true outcome
you know what they say lee
everybody loves a chop pot
