agree. Especially I think when the board

[03:58]

is paired, no club is always better. So

[04:00]
is paired, no club is always better. So

is paired, no club is always better. So
yeah, I think six is especially no club.

&gt;&gt; Are we finding a lead again? So I think

[04:08]
&gt;&gt; Are we finding a lead again? So I think

[04:08]
&gt;&gt; Are we finding a lead again? So I think
actually in theory you should have some

[04:09]
actually in theory you should have some

[04:10]
actually in theory you should have some
very small leads here. Let's say for

[04:11]
very small leads here. Let's say for

[04:11]
very small leads here. Let's say for
example you have an end like four or

[04:13]
example you have an end like four or

[04:13]
example you have an end like four or
five. I think you call and then lead 10%

[04:15]
five. I think you call and then lead 10%

[04:15]

make him fold out bluffs and then you do
the same with like a nine

[04:20]
the same with like a nine

[04:20]
the same with like a nine
&gt;&gt; cuz you he should probably raise like

like mergey type of stuff and you don't

want him to check back. So I think the

[04:29]
want him to check back. So I think the

[04:29]
want him to check back. So I think the
theory here there should be like a very

[04:31]
theory here there should be like a very

theory here there should be like a very
small lead

[04:32]
small lead

[04:32]

[04:35]
&gt;&gt; uh on the river for like your four five

[04:35]
&gt;&gt; uh on the river for like your four five
for example and then maybe and then you

[04:37]
for example and then maybe and then you

[04:37]
for example and then maybe and then you
probably add a nine. I don't think sixes

[04:39]
probably add a nine. I don't think sixes

[04:40]
probably add a nine. I don't think sixes

like if he's sitting there with king

like if he's sitting there with king

jack, he's just like, okay, fold. So he

[20:39]
jack, he's just like, okay, fold. So he

[20:39]
jack, he's just like, okay, fold. So he
calls. I'm kind of torn on what I want

[20:42]
calls. I'm kind of torn on what I want

[20:42]

to do. Like are we looking to shove

[20:45]
to do. Like are we looking to shove

[20:46]
to do. Like are we looking to shove
as a bluff because sometimes he'll fold

[20:49]
as a bluff because sometimes he'll fold

[20:49]
as a bluff because sometimes he'll fold
jacks or are we looking to check and

Ace jack, ace, queen, ace, king. I feel

Ace jack, ace, queen, ace, king. I feel
like you're the leading master, so you

[20:59]
like you're the leading master, so you

[21:00]
like you're the leading master, so you
should have a really good grasp of this.

should have a really good grasp of this.
Um,

[21:04]
Um,

[21:04]
Um,
again, my intuition would be that you

[21:07]
again, my intuition would be that you

[21:07]
again, my intuition would be that you
check that there is no no bluff shoving

[21:10]
check that there is no no bluff shoving

[21:10]
check that there is no no bluff shoving
the 67 and then he's going to shove and

[21:17]
you're probably going to call. That's

[21:20]
you're probably going to call. That's

[21:20]
you're probably going to call. That's
the way I' I'd script this hand. It has

Let's say I would have bet at 20%, then

[21:27]
Let's say I would have bet at 20%, then

[21:27]
Let's say I would have bet at 20%, then
check calling is a bit less of an

check calling is a bit less of an

&gt;&gt; Yeah. You're taking these spots where

[22:10]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You're taking these spots where

[22:10]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You're taking these spots where
you turn a pair into a bluff and you

[22:13]
you turn a pair into a bluff and you

[22:13]
you turn a pair into a bluff and you
know, you bet, you call the big raise.

[22:15]
know, you bet, you call the big raise.

[22:15]
know, you bet, you call the big raise.
So,

[22:17]
So,

[22:17]
So,
it's tough to find many bluff combos for

[22:20]
it's tough to find many bluff combos for

[22:20]
it's tough to find many bluff combos for
you unless you're turning a pair into a

you unless you're turning a pair into a

you unless you're turning a pair into a

&gt;&gt; he's going to call
ace jack, sevens, fives jacks, right?

[35:54]
ace jack, sevens, fives jacks, right?

[35:54]
ace jack, sevens, fives jacks, right?
Which is like

[35:56]
Which is like

[35:56]
Which is like
sometimes he's going to raise some of

[35:58]
sometimes he's going to raise some of

[35:58]
sometimes he's going to raise some of
those on a turn. So that's not too many

[36:00]
those on a turn. So that's not too many

[36:00]
those on a turn. So that's not too many
combos. There's one ace jack,

[36:04]
combos. There's one ace jack,

[36:04]

pushing a pre flop.

[36:10]

&gt;&gt; Yeah. And and some of those rays. So it

[36:13]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And and some of those rays. So it

[36:13]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And and some of those rays. So it
it feels like right you this feels kind

[36:16]
it feels like right you this feels kind

[36:16]
it feels like right you this feels kind
of close. If we're combo counting like

[36:18]
of close. If we're combo counting like

[36:18]
of close. If we're combo counting like
that, right? It's

[36:21]
that, right? It's

[36:21]
that, right? It's
cuz you need them to fold a bit more

[36:23]
cuz you need them to fold a bit more

[36:23]
cuz you need them to fold a bit more
than half the time. We found six folds.

[36:25]
than half the time. We found six folds.

[36:25]
than half the time. We found six folds.
We're going to find probably roughly six

[36:28]
We're going to find probably roughly six

[36:28]
We're going to find probably roughly six
calls. So this is it it feels like this

[36:32]
calls. So this is it it feels like this

[36:32]
calls. So this is it it feels like this
is slightly plus CV and then we just

[36:34]
is slightly plus CV and then we just

[36:34]
is slightly plus CV and then we just
need to compare it to checking at that

[36:36]
need to compare it to checking at that

[36:36]
need to compare it to checking at that
point

[41:28]
&gt;&gt; River. So, you now lose to every single

[41:28]
&gt;&gt; River. So, you now lose to every single
hand that we just mentioned. You lose to

[41:30]
hand that we just mentioned. You lose to

[41:30]
hand that we just mentioned. You lose to
10 nine, you lose to eights, you lose to

[41:32]
10 nine, you lose to eights, you lose to

[41:32]
10 nine, you lose to eights, you lose to
nines, you lose I guess no, you lose to

[41:36]
nines, you lose I guess no, you lose to

[41:36]
nines, you lose I guess no, you lose to
78, you lose to everything.

[41:39]
78, you lose to everything.

[41:39]
78, you lose to everything.
And so we're going to assume

[41:42]
And so we're going to assume

[41:42]
And so we're going to assume
that you decided to turn your hand into

[41:44]
that you decided to turn your hand into

[41:44]
that you decided to turn your hand into
a bluff. That's been the pattern so far.

[41:46]
a bluff. That's been the pattern so far.

[41:46]
a bluff. That's been the pattern so far.
The difference here is you actually do

[41:50]
The difference here is you actually do

[41:50]
The difference here is you actually do
have a bunch of unpaired bluffs to

[41:52]
have a bunch of unpaired bluffs to

[41:52]
have a bunch of unpaired bluffs to
choose from. You could have ace king,

[41:54]
choose from. You could have ace king,

[41:54]
choose from. You could have ace king,
ace queen, king queen. So you're not

[41:56]
ace queen, king queen. So you're not

[41:56]
ace queen, king queen. So you're not
actually supposed to dig this deep. So

[42:01]
actually supposed to dig this deep. So

[42:01]
actually supposed to dig this deep. So
I would say you check the river. Is that

[42:03]
I would say you check the river. Is that

[42:03]
I would say you check the river. Is that
correct?

[42:04]
correct?

[42:04]
correct?
&gt;&gt; Check.

[42:05]
&gt;&gt; Check.

[42:05]
&gt;&gt; Check.
And and now he's going to shab and

[42:08]
And and now he's going to shab and

[42:08]
And and now he's going to shab and
you're going to say, "Well, I lose to

[42:12]
you're going to say, "Well, I lose to

[42:12]
you're going to say, "Well, I lose to
nines. I lose to 10 nine. I lose to

[42:17]
nines. I lose to 10 nine. I lose to

[42:17]
nines. I lose to 10 nine. I lose to
pocket eights." If he decides to shove

[42:19]
pocket eights." If he decides to shove

[42:19]
pocket eights." If he decides to shove
back, I lose to all the flushes.

[42:23]
back, I lose to all the flushes.

[42:23]
back, I lose to all the flushes.
I only beat ace queen with a club and

[42:27]
I only beat ace queen with a club and

[42:27]
I only beat ace queen with a club and
king queen with a club. How many combos

[42:29]
king queen with a club. How many combos

[42:29]
king queen with a club. How many combos
is ace queen and king queen with a club?

[42:31]
is ace queen and king queen with a club?

[42:31]
is ace queen and king queen with a club?
That has to be like 18 or so. Maybe some

[42:35]
That has to be like 18 or so. Maybe some

[42:35]
That has to be like 18 or so. Maybe some
ace king. So like 18 combos. That That's

[42:37]
ace king. So like 18 combos. That That's

[42:38]
ace king. So like 18 combos. That That's
a lot of combos.

[42:39]
a lot of combos.

hands? I mean, we even had a 11 out of

[43:04]
hands? I mean, we even had a 11 out of

[43:04]
hands? I mean, we even had a 11 out of
10. That was next level.

[43:05]
10. That was next level.

[43:05]
10. That was next level.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I feel like the turn play is too

[43:08]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I feel like the turn play is too

[43:08]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I feel like the turn play is too
out there. Um I I could be very wrong,

[43:11]
out there. Um I I could be very wrong,

[43:11]
out there. Um I I could be very wrong,
but to me, when I see this turn, I'm

[43:13]
but to me, when I see this turn, I'm

[43:13]
but to me, when I see this turn, I'm
like, this turn is a bet, right? So, you

[43:16]
like, this turn is a bet, right? So, you

[43:16]
like, this turn is a bet, right? So, you
start out checking the flop. Center of

[43:19]
start out checking the flop. Center of

[43:19]
start out checking the flop. Center of
your flop checking range is like ace,

[43:20]
your flop checking range is like ace,

[43:20]
your flop checking range is like ace,
king, ace, queen. Uh those are the the

[43:24]
king, ace, queen. Uh those are the the

[43:24]
king, ace, queen. Uh those are the the
heavy sitting hands in there.

[43:27]
heavy sitting hands in there.

[43:27]
heavy sitting hands in there.
And then when they don't improve on the

[43:29]
And then when they don't improve on the

[43:29]
And then when they don't improve on the
turn, you're supposed to play very very

[43:31]
turn, you're supposed to play very very

[43:31]
turn, you're supposed to play very very
passively on the turn. So I I would

[43:35]
passively on the turn. So I I would

[43:35]
passively on the turn. So I I would
guess the sizing is too big. The hand

[43:38]
guess the sizing is too big. The hand

guess the sizing is too big. The hand
choice fits in terms of the like there's

[43:42]
choice fits in terms of the like there's

[43:42]
choice fits in terms of the like there's
a pattern recognition that fits, but

[43:44]
a pattern recognition that fits, but

[43:44]
a pattern recognition that fits, but
this isn't the the situation for being

[43:46]
this isn't the the situation for being

[43:46]
this isn't the the situation for being
so aggressive, right? Like it it's

[43:49]
so aggressive, right? Like it it's

[43:49]
so aggressive, right? Like it it's
you're you're taking a like a very sharp

you're pushing
you're pushing into too strong of a

you're pushing into too strong of a
range turn that big. The the turn favors

[44:11]
range turn that big. The the turn favors

[44:11]
range turn that big. The the turn favors
his range a bit too much for the play.

[44:13]
his range a bit too much for the play.

[44:13]
his range a bit too much for the play.
Yeah.

[44:13]
Yeah.

[44:13]
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Fair. If he shows a bluff, do I get

[44:16]
&gt;&gt; Fair. If he shows a bluff, do I get

[44:16]
&gt;&gt; Fair. If he shows a bluff, do I get
extra point? If he shows, as Owen said,

[44:19]
extra point? If he shows, as Owen said,

[44:19]
extra point? If he shows, as Owen said,
an illegal bluff, do I get extra points?

[44:21]
an illegal bluff, do I get extra points?

[44:21]
an illegal bluff, do I get extra points?
&gt;&gt; What would be an illegal bluff? Like a

[44:23]
&gt;&gt; What would be an illegal bluff? Like a

[44:23]
&gt;&gt; What would be an illegal bluff? Like a
six five of diamonds. Yeah, a hand that

[44:25]
six five of diamonds. Yeah, a hand that

[44:25]
six five of diamonds. Yeah, a hand that
he's not allowed to to bluff with.

[44:27]
he's not allowed to to bluff with.

[44:27]
he's not allowed to to bluff with.
&gt;&gt; Jesus, I just noticed he might call

[44:29]
&gt;&gt; Jesus, I just noticed he might call

[44:29]
&gt;&gt; Jesus, I just noticed he might call
fives, fours, threes, deuces on the

[44:31]
fives, fours, threes, deuces on the

[44:31]
fives, fours, threes, deuces on the
turn. We didn't even mention those.

[44:34]
turn. We didn't even mention those.

[44:34]
turn. We didn't even mention those.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if he if he shows up with fours

[44:36]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if he if he shows up with fours

[44:36]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if he if he shows up with fours
with a club, you get you get the points

with a club, you get you get the points

[44:38]
with a club, you get you get the points
back.

[44:39]
back.

[44:39]

&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's like he has extra bluffs

[44:40]
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's like he has extra bluffs

[44:40]
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's like he has extra bluffs
now. He actually had a bluff that he was

[44:42]
now. He actually had a bluff that he was

[44:42]
now. He actually had a bluff that he was
not supposed to have.

[44:43]
not supposed to have.

[44:43]
not supposed to have.
&gt;&gt; Why was he not supposed to have this

[44:45]
&gt;&gt; Why was he not supposed to have this

[44:45]
&gt;&gt; Why was he not supposed to have this
one?

[44:46]

&gt;&gt; This one or at least when I looked at
when I reviewed this hand, uh the queen

very big part of the strategy, but it

[44:57]
very big part of the strategy, but it

very big part of the strategy, but it
was it he he did consider it. Uh, and

[45:01]
was it he he did consider it. Uh, and

[45:01]
was it he he did consider it. Uh, and
this hand, uh, his hand plays fine and

[45:03]
this hand, uh, his hand plays fine and

[45:03]
this hand, uh, his hand plays fine and
should just check back river and win

[45:05]
should just check back river and win

[45:05]
should just check back river and win
versus a my ace queen and my king queen.

[45:07]
versus a my ace queen and my king queen.

Uh, so an overb bluff by his side.

[45:10]
Uh, so an overb bluff by his side.

[45:10]
Uh, so an overb bluff by his side.
&gt;&gt; And is your hand supposed to is that the

[45:12]
&gt;&gt; And is your hand supposed to is that the

[45:12]
&gt;&gt; And is your hand supposed to is that the
bet size for for the turn for you or is

[45:14]
bet size for for the turn for you or is

[45:14]
bet size for for the turn for you or is
it something smaller?

[45:17]
it something smaller?

[45:17]
it something smaller?
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I I no longer recall if I

[45:19]
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I I no longer recall if I

[45:19]
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I I no longer recall if I
then put it in this bet size and

[45:21]
then put it in this bet size and

[45:21]
then put it in this bet size and
therefore it beded or if it was that

[45:22]
therefore it beded or if it was that

therefore it beded or if it was that
that I don't recall. It was long time

[45:24]

ago that I uh that I saw that I reviewed

[45:26]

sizing it sprinkled it in there. 910

[45:31]
sizing it sprinkled it in there. 910

[45:31]
sizing it sprinkled it in there. 910
definitely better.

[45:32]
definitely better.

[45:32]
definitely better.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, it I think it fits the size.

[45:34]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, it I think it fits the size.

[45:34]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, it I think it fits the size.
Okay. So So I have to do this because I
