it's by exploiting basically you
understand how eevee is generated in
theory
and now you're gonna go from defensive
poker so you're trying to play
as unexploitable as possible gto so
basically if someone else deviates you
win
okay but now you're gonna go to how i
would call it offensive poker basically
you're gonna open your game up for
exploitation
you're gonna exploit your opponents if
they don't
re-exploit you you will have the
maximizing strategy
okay so it's exploitative but you're
optimizing versus that exploit

welcome fellow poker players to another
video here on the poker ambition channel
in which today we are going to be
discussing
how to go from 2bb to 8bb
a little bit of a different touch this
video okay we're not going to say check
raise more
see that more etc etc no we're going to
go
look at being a poker professional as a
whole so not only the playing but
also everything that goes around being a
professional poker player
okay it kind of all has to work at least
into
a certain level in order for you guys to
succeed in your poker career
now if you liked this video make sure to
remember to give it a thumbs up and
leave a comment down below
and without further ado let's get into
it so i named it going from 2bb
to 8bb and this was actually based
on a couple of questions that i got on
twitch
where i stream if you guys have never
followed a twitch stream
please come along to the waco show and
basically
they're asking well mr wacko what do you
think your current win rate is
okay this was me playing four hours a
week
having some fun at 500 zoom with the
twitch chat
and i said to them wow i don't know
probably around 2 bb
and then a session later someone asked
me what do you what winrate do you think
is possible
and i answered 8bp so
that means that there is a gap between
what i'm currently winning
and what i think it's possible to win at
these games so then i started to think
hey this is actually great content
to explain to you guys guys how i would
now close that gap
okay if you don't follow me guys
twitch.tv slash poker ambition the wacko
show
please come give a follow a stream uh go
go over to the twitch stream
and to the to the schedule and there you
can see
when i'll be live but without further
ado let's get into point one
which is quite obvious so how do we go
from zero to one basically how do we
you know become a non-losing player not
break even player well these are like
your fundamentals right
um so i call them like your cb game this
is kind of
for example when i started streaming i
hadn't played
in quite a while so basically the game
that showed up was gonna be my c game
like the absolute
bottom where i could fall back on
in general in order for you to start
winning at poker you're probably playing
at the right stake for your skill and
bankroll
it's quite obvious you have some decent
preflop ranges you have a certain
default understanding of how poker works
and then i mean
how do you generate ev you are probably
able to
translate how to generate mv into a
strategy that you can
execute so this is like your
interpretation of how poco works
and you probably have certain basics of
mental game performance
and management of your career now you
might be better in
some areas and you slack in others but
basically this
if you would count up these what it is
one two three four if you would count up
these five points it would have a
certain minimum which makes you a
winning player
very basic tend to go from one to two
eliminating distractions and stop
multitasking now obviously
if i would if i'm streaming twitch i'm
multitasking and i'm very distracted so
obviously that doesn't really contribute
to a high rim rate
but i see a lot of players they might
use skype discord whatever while playing
they have their cell phone inside
these are all attention killers okay
your brain can not multitask
all right you can maybe train it to
shift between
tasks faster but it's either focusing on
one tasks or the other
and the problem with this is as soon as
you switch a task or as soon as you get
distracted
as point 2 mentions it takes your brain
roughly
20 to 25 minutes in order to refocus so
to get back to the same level of focus
now if you know this it's very important
to
protect your focus and protect your
playing environment so you don't get
disturbed
okay another very important thing is to
get your mind in the right place
setting intention to focus and refocus
setting the intention to focus is quite
interesting and actually i have a point
i think a couple of bb's later
where i talk a little bit about how the
brain works
in involves how the brain works
when it comes down to playing poker but
i think especially setting the intention
to refocus so when you notice that your
mind is drifting off
some mindfulness here making the
commitment now that
you will spot that and refocus okay as
soon as you feel
a little bit rushed or as soon as you
feel a little bit impatient
that you start to observe those feelings
and have a point to come back to
okay for example i would say okay how
can i
increase my win rate at this table if i
feel like i'm zoning out because
um the challenge might not be big enough
or i
in general i'm just autopiloting and i
don't really feel engaged
all right so i have points that i have
the intention that i will refocus on
certain points in order to
re-engage myself into the session
another thing you can do is invest in
long-term concentration enhancing habits
meditation definitely has shown to
increase your focus because basically
you're training your muscle to get
better at refocusing
actually adam has a whole part on how to
do this and how to get better at this in
the mechanics of
poker so two to three bb okay we're
starting to
become an okay winner how do we get
further well we have to increase
our engagement and curiosity and this is
kind of the point that i touched on
about the brain
the brain goes on autopilot if it
identifies a repetitive task in order to
save energy
your brain is an energy consuming
machine
it knows that and you know your body and
your brain they communicate quite well
in order to save energy he sees okay
you're playing poker every day
and if you don't set new goals and are
not engaged you will start your brain
will start to recognize
poker's repetitive tasks and will go on
autopilot to save energy
now think about that one for a second so
the thing that's actually your work and
that you're trying to excel one your
brain
is associating as a repetitive desk and
therefore goes an autopilot
big mistake okay this is not what we
want the brain to do but
you know the brain thinks this is good
for us so how do we prevent that
that is by erasing our curiosity and
increasing our engagement
like setting certain intentions having
certain focus points that's why i think
it's always important to
work on certain strategy related topics
not necessarily
let's say for example you you have been
putting extra work into your big blind
check race ranges
okay so every time that spot comes up
you're like oh yeah this was that spot
probably everyone has noticed it right
after you've done strategy and you
recognize that spot at the table you
feel more engaged
and in general you're more engaged
because you've told your brain hey
we got some things that we have to look
out for so your brain is like okay so i
have to pay attention okay i will pay
attention
and the result of that is that obviously
that spot that you're studying
is going better but in general you'll be
more engaged because your brain is not
on autopilot
okay this is like a little hack here
flow triggers this is in general kind of
what brings you into the flow states for
the people that don't know a flow state
is basically that moment where you kind
of forget about time and you're just so
engaged and just
the whole world around you seems to fade
away and before you know it's only an
hour has passed by
and you played really good poker well
guys this is not a coincidence
you have certain flow triggers and i
think raising your curiosity and
engagement while playing is definitely
one of them and
in general this is very important in
like long-term motivation and long-term
engagement
knowing where you're going and why okay
so having a deep
driver in order to sort of always be
motivated
if we go to point three and four i've
added
game selection and networking and i
would like to start off with the first
point
that is if you are number six in the
world and you play a six-handed game
versus number one and five
you will lose guys so if your definition
of
success as a poker player is make the
most amount of money possible at the
tables
game selection is very important and
that's something to see players
just battle it out and you know this all
all the panzer if they're just very
competitive and they don't really care
about the money as much and their
definition of succeeding is trying to
beat those guys then by all means this
is very much in line with your goals
but for a lot of people who are maybe
less competitive or
they the money the money matters more to
them this is probably not a great
strategy
okay you have certain poker players that
might not be
as good theoretical okay i mean this
guy's number six in the world
he did create a quite a good job but
let's say number 500 in the world while
number 500 in the world plays against
you know
uh the number thousand and and down down
onwards
he's gonna make a lot of money so if you
can get
yourself into games where you're always
the best player at the table
preferably for as much money as you can
afford to lose that is probably a very
good way to make a lot of money playing
poker and some
this is kind of often forgot basically
and you have a lot of people that like
no the 500 zoom pool for example no you
know comfortable
i just sit down or i just click play i
don't have to
okay make a conscious commitment but i
usually find just that as an excuse it
will definitely
slow down your career depending on your
goals of course
knowing when not to play also i put it
here management basically i mean like
energy management
time management uh but take the 500 zoom
pool for example
if i would want to go from 2 8 b i would
definitely be more selective in when i
play the poo because
i think sometimes the poo offers me a 10
bb win rate and sometimes i definitely
break even depending on how the pool
looks
and i do see players grinding that stick
for a living and then i think
i think your game selection or your pool
selection in that case
it's not really spot on also know when
to play
it's also like it's an ego thing okay
you have to take
poker series you should you do this as a
career it's not just something
you know you're not just putting your
dick on a table and seeing who has the
biggest
you know you have to kind of surpass
that and surpass your ego
another good thing about networking and
actually the next slide i will go a
little bit further into networking
is that you will be the first to know
about opportunities in games and being
able to play in them okay if you're
for good networking skills you might get
invited into certain games
or you might get a tip because you know
you have a broad range of networks
people like you
they will give you a tip about some site
that you know it's a little bit
underground still but they can keep
get you in so i think it's a very
important and underrated skill
four and five i will get to the feedback
loop
and the feedback loop is something that
basically it stands for continuous
improvement
and basically if you can optimize the
feedback loop
you will become a better player and a
more consistent player
and your improvement will be continuous
that's why it's called continuous
improvement
very important here that you have a
growth mindset so
the way you look at obstacles any way
you look at mistakes
there are opportunities for growth so
you actually look at them and see what
you can learn from them in order to
improve
so the power of continuous improvement
that i've touched on
basically it's managing your poker
career
and becoming a more professional player
in general okay so less
being less of the gamer you know i feel
like playing poker oh it's a
bit i'm a bit tired now i feel like i
now go to bed everything is based on
feeling and not based on structure
and in general success is habitual so
actually i have the feedback loop
right here this is kind of what i came
up with
a little while ago i haven't really
redone it probably if i would take a new
look at it i could probably improve some
things
but basically it starts with your
preparation then you go into performance
then you're gonna evaluate the
performance so basically you have the
outcome
and the outcome you're going to evaluate
very important to not evaluate it on
dollars one okay this is a mindset flaw
but evaluated on how well you did on
certain focus points remember the
refocus that we set
how well did we do on refocusing okay
then you can monitor basically this is
more of a
a statistical thing for example how
often you manage to get your mind back
to the present moment
or the check raising example of did we
indeed increase our check raise
percentage okay this is a stat for
example that we can monitor
to see if we're actually executing what
we're trying to do
then you're going to analyze so you kind
of analyze for example your data or your
performance
and with those data you're gonna go or
with certain hands
you're gonna go and discuss with your
network that's why it's very important
to have a team around you which is
i'm going further in the next slide
you're gonna discuss certain hands or
certain data
with your peer group from that you will
get feedback
you will process that feedback in to
your strategy
then you will train your strategy
there's various ways to do that gto
trainer for example is
is is a way to do that and then
basically
you're gonna enter the loop again you're
gonna prepare
with the new knowledge you learn from
your knowledge you're gonna try to
perform again
you're then gonna evaluate how you did
etc etc i said the loop never continues
as soon as soon as you basically stop
the loop and you think like oh i'm not
good enough
that's the point where you go down okay
guys there's no stagnation
there's only forward or backwards and
it's up to you
if you go forward or backwards
especially in poker because the rest is
always trying to improve
so basically if you slack off the rest
will just surpass you
five and six evaluation and input
basically
at the evaluation point you can get very
good at that okay you have
solvers nowadays to evaluate how you did
in certain spots you can track
kpis which stands for key performance
indicators
like for example uh how did you do on
the big blind check race
the statistic that you could that that
you could monitor
okay you can set for example i often set
a goal if
if i see certain points of my game are
off i might say i might set a
statistical goal
and i might have a filter ready after
every session i will load in that filter
okay i'm in a big blind i could check
raise the flop how did i do in this spot
okay setting the intention and
evaluating it as long as you're not
tracking it as long as you're not trying
to evaluate it
you don't know if you're actually doing
it correctly it will be based on feeling
the bigger the dream the more important
the team
okay and i cannot emphasize this enough
i think eliot wrote a great quote
that sad high six players don't hang out
with each other because they're
high-tech players but they're high six
players because they hang out with each
other
think about that one for a second so
basically
you see this or same you're the average
of five of the five people you hang out
most with
it all comes down to the same thing guys
gathering yourself in the right team
for example in the feedback loop to
discuss and get better feedback
is very important i for example
if you look at my team it's a i mean
there are strat buddies students
some fellow coaches of poker ambition
made a little list here
explode can't be seven tunis knee two my
three elusive mark
flusu poker klutka bill lewinsky tinu
mulder
believe me guys if if i have a question
some of these guys will have
probably the best answer in the world so
i'm very confident
in my ability to be a poker coach and a
poker player
not necessarily because how i play today
but i have a lot of confidence in the
future as well because i'm not alone
okay all these guys are willing to help
me whenever i ask they're willing to
give me input whenever i want to ask
okay this is very important to invest
timing guys to get a network
six to seven mental game analyzing
self-sabotaging behaviors
basically at some point in your career
you will
encounter certain difficulties basically
you know you should do something but
you're not doing it
and sometimes it can be good to kind of
put that under the under the loop and
see
what's going on here and sometimes you
will see that it's something self
sabotaging meaning
that you think you want something but
actually in your head you have a certain
belief
that if you get there it will come to
the cost of something and then
you will show self-sabotaging behavior
another very important point is a
limiting belief
these kind of go hand in hand
for example if you don't believe that
you can learn from your mistakes
okay then why would you even start
looking at mistakes in the first place
all right same with if you have the
belief that you have to be
super intelligent in order to beat
high-sex poker
and you don't think you're very
intelligent then basically
you will never get to high-sex poker
because this belief will always be in
the way
why would you put in extra effort if you
believe that it's
iq that you need to play 2k or higher
for example
and your iq doesn't match that of
players who play 2k and higher why would
you even put in the extra work
consistency is everything and basically
mental game will
make you perform more consistently
because your confidence will be stabler
you will have less tilt you will show up
more consistently
and basically if you have a very solid b
game and that always shows up your down
swings will also get
less basically because you're performing
at a higher rim rate more consistently
so basically also you will need you will
need your mental game
less because you have less swings in
your game if that makes sense
mental game mistakes in game and i will
basically just as tilt
and mental game mistakes anything that
is that you would afterwards know
the right answer to but in game you did
something else is
a form of tilt or a mental game mistake
for example the majority of my mistakes
that i make
while playing often after i made the
made to play i already knew [ __ ] this
was not a good idea or afterwards i know
like um yeah this was indeed a mistake
then it's a mental game mistake not a
technical mistake so i can go to a
solver
and it will tell me something but yeah
it's something that i already knew i
have to then figure out okay what was i
thinking about in game in which order
in order of importance and how is that
different
than how i now look at the situation
what was the point that i've overrated
or underrated what was the point that i
forgot
okay then going back to the feedback
loop i can set that as an intention
or i can even train that way of thinking
by playing the hand
and out loud saying how i want to be
thinking about that hand putting that
also in my session intentions
this is how i want to think in this kind
of situations in this order of
importance
you could even visualize that i'm a big
fan of visualization before your session
so you can actually visualize yourself
being in that situation and thinking
about the right
things in the right order actually adam
carmichael has a big
part of visualization in the mechanics
of poker as well which i'm very excited
about
it's a very very very useful skill guys
and the last point because as you can
see we're reaching the abb
is exploitation so i'm
assuming that by now you have a very
solid
uh game you have a very solid feedback
loop you have a very solid team around
you basically you're unstoppable
so how do you get to that next level
well it's
by exploiting basically you understand
how eevee is generated in theory
and now you're gonna go from defensive
poker so you're trying to play as
unexploitable as possible gto
so basically if someone else deviates
you win okay
but now you're gonna go to how i would
call it offensive poker basically you're
gonna open your game up for exploitation
you're gonna exploit your opponents if
they don't re-exploit you you will have
the maximizing strategy
okay so it's exploitative but you're
optimizing versus that exploit
and this is kind of i think where the
next level comes in
because it's basically impossible for a
human to play gto we only try
to and i think playing a good exploitive
strategy is actually in
in our grasp we can actually do that
while playing good
gto exact gto is impossible so i think
you have a better
chance at succeeding if you obviously
understand gto you understand how eevee
works you understand
how poker works basically if you don't
yet i will explain you that in the
mechanics of poker
and then from there you're gonna go to
maximize your ev
and basically how do you do that is you
understand where your ev is going to
come from
based on all factors so gto generates ev
in a certain way it turns his equity
into ev
and he does that based on certain things
that are going to happen
now or later in the tree in practice
other things happen and that have
impact on your ev okay
so when you understand how ev is
generated you then also understand
how it's not generated based on certain
practical situations
so you will learn how to adjust
correctly and that's kind of when
the real high win rates start to get in
so now you know guys how to get from 2
to 8bp
if you need any help with that we have a
program the mechanics of poker which
basically gives you extra ways um
in order to increase your win rate
everything where you explained what to
do when to do it
how to do it all the other questions
that might remain go over to

see if it's something for you
if not i'm pretty sure there were a
