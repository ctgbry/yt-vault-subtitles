Um, no. So that was the first mixed game

[22:10]
Um, no. So that was the first mixed game

Um, no. So that was the first mixed game
that I had found and then sort of the

next couple of years I'd found some

[22:16]
next couple of years I'd found some

[22:16]
next couple of years I'd found some
more. So I think I

[22:19]
more. So I think I

[22:19]
more. So I think I
was 19 20 when I had found full tilt and

[22:24]
was 19 20 when I had found full tilt and

[22:24]
was 19 20 when I had found full tilt and
then kind of opened the scope of all the

[22:27]
then kind of opened the scope of all the

[22:27]
then kind of opened the scope of all the
mix games and everything there. So it

mix games and everything there. So it
was kind of eight game there. That was

Uh sort of trying to examine that and
that was tough for me that kind of

[24:12]
that was tough for me that kind of

[24:12]
that was tough for me that kind of
self-reflection and doubt. So

[24:15]
self-reflection and doubt. So

[24:15]
self-reflection and doubt. So
uh yeah, that was

[24:19]
uh yeah, that was

[24:19]
uh yeah, that was
um a tough period I guess before I kind

[24:23]
um a tough period I guess before I kind

[24:23]
um a tough period I guess before I kind
of transition to other things too.

What did this time of struggle teach you

[24:32]
What did this time of struggle teach you

[24:32]
What did this time of struggle teach you
that you think set you up for a long and

[24:35]
that you think set you up for a long and

[24:35]
that you think set you up for a long and
successful poker career?

[24:39]
Yeah, I think it taught

[24:43]
me to to actually focus on your leaks in

[24:47]
me to to actually focus on your leaks in

[24:47]
me to to actually focus on your leaks in
a way. Heads Up is just a game

[24:54]
where it's a like very it becomes

[24:56]
where it's a like very it becomes

[24:56]
where it's a like very it becomes
clearer what your leaks are in a way.

[24:59]
clearer what your leaks are in a way.

[24:59]
clearer what your leaks are in a way.
So, uh rather than sort

battered by repetition in those from the

[25:14]
battered by repetition in those from the

[25:14]
battered by repetition in those from the
number of hands you're playing. So

[25:16]
number of hands you're playing. So

[25:16]
number of hands you're playing. So
obviously heads up, you're just playing

[25:19]
obviously heads up, you're just playing

[25:19]
obviously heads up, you're just playing
so many more hands. You're putting into

[25:20]
so many more hands. You're putting into

[25:20]
so many more hands. You're putting into
put into more difficult spots

[25:25]
put into more difficult spots

[25:25]
put into more difficult spots
and it benefits your game more to focus

[25:29]
and it benefits your game more to focus

[25:29]
and it benefits your game more to focus
on those leaks to have those become

[25:32]
on those leaks to have those become

[25:32]
on those leaks to have those become
better rather than just kind of

[25:35]
better rather than just kind of

[25:35]
better rather than just kind of
uh focus on things you think you might

[25:38]
uh focus on things you think you might

[25:38]
uh focus on things you think you might
be good at and just like make your

[25:40]
be good at and just like make your

[25:40]
be good at and just like make your
strengths a tiny bit better rather than

[25:42]
strengths a tiny bit better rather than

[25:42]

like really trying to bring the worst

[25:43]
like really trying to bring the worst

[25:44]
like really trying to bring the worst
parts of your game up. and really trying

[25:46]
parts of your game up. and really trying

parts of your game up. and really trying
to focus on those and uh it

[25:51]
to focus on those and uh it

[25:51]
to focus on those and uh it
really tried to like I really try to be

[25:55]
really tried to like I really try to be

[25:55]
really tried to like I really try to be
realistic in those times about my

[25:57]
realistic in those times about my

[25:57]
realistic in those times about my
ability and where I'm kind of strong or

[26:00]
ability and where I'm kind of strong or

[26:00]
ability and where I'm kind of strong or
where I might not be. So like the the

[26:04]
where I might not be. So like the the

[26:04]
where I might not be. So like the the
self-awareness there I think that taught

[26:06]
self-awareness there I think that taught

[26:06]
self-awareness there I think that taught
me was really important.

[26:10]
me was really important.

[26:10]
me was really important.
um trying to be as self-aware as I can

[26:12]
um trying to be as self-aware as I can

[26:12]
um trying to be as self-aware as I can
and trying to examine where I think I

[26:15]
and trying to examine where I think I

[26:15]
and trying to examine where I think I
might uh not be good or you know even

[26:19]
might uh not be good or you know even

[26:19]
might uh not be good or you know even
for example in the heads up hierarchy as

[26:21]
for example in the heads up hierarchy as

[26:21]
for example in the heads up hierarchy as
it were that you sort of might know your

[26:22]
it were that you sort of might know your

[26:22]
it were that you sort of might know your
place if like you can beat all these

[26:24]
place if like you can beat all these

[26:24]
place if like you can beat all these
people but you can't beat this person um

[26:27]
people but you can't beat this person um

[26:27]
people but you can't beat this person um
then it's sort of important to not be

[26:31]
then it's sort of important to not be

[26:32]
then it's sort of important to not be
deluded in your ability thinking you can

[26:34]
deluded in your ability thinking you can

[26:34]
deluded in your ability thinking you can
beat this person and just play them when

[26:37]
beat this person and just play them when

[26:37]
beat this person and just play them when
you're losing money obviously. Uh

[26:40]
you're losing money obviously. Uh

[26:40]
you're losing money obviously. Uh
so that's also just an important thing

[26:44]
so that's also just an important thing

[26:44]
so that's also just an important thing
to kind of have your confidence in check

[26:47]
to kind of have your confidence in check

[26:47]
to kind of have your confidence in check
in a way uh and potentially keep your

[26:51]
in a way uh and potentially keep your

[26:51]
in a way uh and potentially keep your
ego out of it. Um so yeah, I think

[26:55]
ego out of it. Um so yeah, I think

[26:55]
ego out of it. Um so yeah, I think
trying to be realistic about my skill,

[26:57]
trying to be realistic about my skill,

[26:57]
trying to be realistic about my skill,
trying to kind of not be deluded about

[27:00]
trying to kind of not be deluded about

[27:00]
trying to kind of not be deluded about
things like that and be rational about

[27:02]
things like that and be rational about

[27:02]
things like that and be rational about
things and critically examine, those

[27:05]
things and critically examine, those

[27:05]
things and critically examine, those
were all important things I learned.

well is that people then see like, okay,

well is that people then see like, okay,
I'm in a down swing. They put it in the

[45:01]
I'm in a down swing. They put it in the

[45:02]
I'm in a down swing. They put it in the
variance calculator, right? They put

[45:03]
variance calculator, right? They put

[45:03]
variance calculator, right? They put
their win rate that they've observed.

[45:05]
their win rate that they've observed.

[45:05]
their win rate that they've observed.
They say, "Okay, I I have to grind this

[45:06]
They say, "Okay, I I have to grind this

[45:06]
They say, "Okay, I I have to grind this
out, so I have to just play 200k hands

[45:08]
out, so I have to just play 200k hands

out, so I have to just play 200k hands
and then I'll be out of it." Not

[45:09]
and then I'll be out of it." Not

and then I'll be out of it." Not
realizing that their current win rate is

[45:11]
realizing that their current win rate is

[45:11]
realizing that their current win rate is
no longer their actual win rate. So the

[45:12]
no longer their actual win rate. So the

[45:12]
no longer their actual win rate. So the
down swing will only last more. And it's

[45:14]
down swing will only last more. And it's

it's really uh usually when you ask him

it's really uh usually when you ask him
like what are you trying to do while I'm

like what are you trying to do while I'm

like what are you trying to do while I'm
trying to get out of it? Okay. So you

[45:20]
trying to get out of it? Okay. So you

[45:20]
trying to get out of it? Okay. So you
think now playing more in a compromised

[45:21]
think now playing more in a compromised

[45:21]
think now playing more in a compromised
state is going to get you out of it.

Usually the intention is good but

kind of correct. Yeah. I I was actually

[45:27]
kind of correct. Yeah. I I was actually

[45:27]
kind of correct. Yeah. I I was actually
going to say the same thing. I remember

[45:29]
going to say the same thing. I remember

[45:29]
going to say the same thing. I remember
during that time when I I felt like

[45:31]
during that time when I I felt like

[45:31]
during that time when I I felt like
obligated to play and I didn't

[45:32]
obligated to play and I didn't

[45:33]
obligated to play and I didn't
particularly want to actively be playing

[45:35]
particularly want to actively be playing

particularly want to actively be playing
because of the kind of that that mindset

[45:38]
because of the kind of that that mindset

[45:38]
because of the kind of that that mindset
that I think I I wasn't playing my a

[45:40]
that I think I I wasn't playing my a

[45:40]
that I think I I wasn't playing my a
game. I think it was likely that you

know my ROI was lower in general.

[45:47]
know my ROI was lower in general.

[45:47]
know my ROI was lower in general.
So what both variance is higher

[45:50]
So what both variance is higher

[45:50]
So what both variance is higher
essentially when your ROI is lower and

[45:52]
essentially when your ROI is lower and

[45:52]
essentially when your ROI is lower and
you're battling there but also just that

you're battling there but also just that

you're battling there but also just that
the win rate was lower and I wasn't

do a good job of not having the dollar

do a good job of not having the dollar
value best for each game, but like the

affair, but it also feels like you have

[51:47]
affair, but it also feels like you have

affair, but it also feels like you have
an ability to manage these better than

[51:49]
an ability to manage these better than

an ability to manage these better than
most people. Let's just put it that way.

[51:51]
most people. Let's just put it that way.

[51:51]
most people. Let's just put it that way.
Because even though you're you're

Because even though you're you're

Because even though you're you're
struggling, other players must be

[51:54]
struggling, other players must be

[51:54]
struggling, other players must be
struggling twice as much. Yeah, I'm

[51:55]
struggling twice as much. Yeah, I'm

[51:55]
struggling twice as much. Yeah, I'm
curious to know for you when you're

[51:57]
curious to know for you when you're

[51:57]
curious to know for you when you're
playing lots of different formats at the

playing lots of different formats at the

playing lots of different formats at the
same time. I'm just trying to relate to

[52:00]
same time. I'm just trying to relate to

[52:00]
same time. I'm just trying to relate to
that experience. It must be very

for different game types, different

buyins. How do you uh maybe simplify

[52:08]
buyins. How do you uh maybe simplify

your decision- making to allow yourself

your decision- making to allow yourself
to to play so many different formats

[52:11]
to to play so many different formats

[52:11]
to to play so many different formats
simultaneously?

[52:15]
Yeah, as as you said, it is a

[52:18]
Yeah, as as you said, it is a

[52:18]
Yeah, as as you said, it is a
simplification

[52:22]
where spots where there definitely is

where spots where there definitely is
going to be

going to be
um exploits available or certain things

um exploits available or certain things

[52:30]
um exploits available or certain things
that

[52:31]
that

that
are going to be higher EV decisions. if

[52:35]
are going to be higher EV decisions. if

are going to be higher EV decisions. if
I was like really locked in on one or

[52:37]
I was like really locked in on one or

I was like really locked in on one or
two tables. But realistically, if I'm a

unfortunately.

unfortunately.
So, I'd probably simplify just by

So, I'd probably simplify just by

likely reduces my ROI there. So, I I I

don't think it's a good thing really.

Yeah, but it must be a effective

Yeah, but it must be a effective

Yeah, but it must be a effective

Yeah.
Yeah. You're making a big sacrifice, a

during that. And if it doesn't help with

the grind, it probably gets put on the

[54:51]
the grind, it probably gets put on the

[54:51]
the grind, it probably gets put on the

back burner. If it feels like it
complements it, it sounds like for you

[54:54]
complements it, it sounds like for you

personally, you would you would keep it

grind and yeah, they want to optimize

their performance during it. What would

[55:03]
their performance during it. What would

[55:03]
their performance during it. What would
be your top three tips to increase their

[55:06]
be your top three tips to increase their

[55:06]
be your top three tips to increase their
results or just survive a series like

[55:08]
results or just survive a series like

[55:08]
results or just survive a series like
that? Okay.

[55:11]
that? Okay.

[55:11]
that? Okay.
Um I guess first thing would be the

[55:14]
Um I guess first thing would be the

[55:14]
Um I guess first thing would be the
assumption

[55:16]
assumption

[55:16]
assumption
that they won't move time zone I guess

[55:20]
that they won't move time zone I guess

[55:20]
that they won't move time zone I guess
for that. So let's say assuming that

[55:21]
for that. So let's say assuming that

[55:21]
for that. So let's say assuming that
they're going to play it from wherever

[55:24]
they're going to play it from wherever

[55:24]
they're going to play it from wherever
they normally play online. So,

[55:28]
they normally play online. So,

[55:28]
they normally play online. So,
uh, for me again, my main consideration,

[55:31]
uh, for me again, my main consideration,

[55:31]
uh, for me again, my main consideration,
like this series, for example, I

[55:35]
like this series, for example, I

[55:35]
like this series, for example, I
basically just decided I was going back

[55:37]
basically just decided I was going back

[55:37]
basically just decided I was going back
to Vancouver, even though it's on too

[55:38]
to Vancouver, even though it's on too

[55:38]
to Vancouver, even though it's on too
early of a time zone for me. Um, I would

[55:42]
early of a time zone for me. Um, I would

[55:42]
early of a time zone for me. Um, I would
prefer somewhere a bit more east of

[55:44]
prefer somewhere a bit more east of

[55:44]
prefer somewhere a bit more east of
there. So, I was debating that.

[55:47]
there. So, I was debating that.

[55:47]
there. So, I was debating that.
Um,

[55:49]
Um,

[55:49]
Um,
I go there also just because I like the

[55:53]
I go there also just because I like the

[55:53]
I go there also just because I like the
whole

[55:55]
whole

[55:55]
whole
uh environment basically kind of the the

[55:59]
uh environment basically kind of the the

[55:59]
uh environment basically kind of the the
atmosphere and I sort of curate it in a

[56:02]
atmosphere and I sort of curate it in a

[56:02]
atmosphere and I sort of curate it in a
way of like I'm planning to be focusing

[56:05]
way of like I'm planning to be focusing

[56:05]
way of like I'm planning to be focusing
on this series during that time but also

[56:07]
on this series during that time but also

[56:08]
on this series during that time but also
I'm like okay I know the things that I'm

[56:11]
I'm like okay I know the things that I'm

[56:11]
I'm like okay I know the things that I'm
going to do in the evenings roughly. I

[56:14]
going to do in the evenings roughly. I

[56:14]
going to do in the evenings roughly. I
could go to this gym. I can go to

[56:16]
could go to this gym. I can go to

[56:16]
could go to this gym. I can go to
whatever class, the yoga class,

[56:18]
whatever class, the yoga class,

[56:18]
whatever class, the yoga class,
something like this. That's going to be

[56:19]
something like this. That's going to be

[56:19]
something like this. That's going to be
nice for me in the evening. So, I

[56:24]
think one thing is just have the that

[56:28]
think one thing is just have the that

[56:28]
think one thing is just have the that
environment clearly

[56:31]
environment clearly

[56:31]
environment clearly
uh set up in a way, assuming that

[56:34]
uh set up in a way, assuming that

[56:34]
uh set up in a way, assuming that
they're going to play it from their

[56:35]
they're going to play it from their

[56:35]
they're going to play it from their
house. That's kind of what I was

[56:37]
house. That's kind of what I was

[56:37]
house. That's kind of what I was
thinking about. You probably know things

[56:38]
thinking about. You probably know things

[56:38]
thinking about. You probably know things
that are around your house um that you

[56:42]
that are around your house um that you

[56:42]
that are around your house um that you
can

[56:43]
can

[56:43]
can
do, but think about how it might

[56:46]
do, but think about how it might

[56:46]
do, but think about how it might
complement the grind or not and

[56:51]
complement the grind or not and

[56:51]
complement the grind or not and
how you best operate for those kind of

[56:55]
how you best operate for those kind of

[56:55]
how you best operate for those kind of
things

[56:56]
things

[56:56]
things
like before and after the grind. Is it

[56:59]
like before and after the grind. Is it

[56:59]
like before and after the grind. Is it
nice for you

[57:00]
nice for you

[57:00]
nice for you
to, you know, work out beforehand, after

[57:03]
to, you know, work out beforehand, after

[57:03]
to, you know, work out beforehand, after
it? How do you decompress after the

[57:06]
it? How do you decompress after the

[57:06]
it? How do you decompress after the
grind before sleep? So your schedules

[57:09]
grind before sleep? So your schedules

[57:09]
grind before sleep? So your schedules
for this is very important obviously

[57:11]
for this is very important obviously

[57:11]
for this is very important obviously
like sleep schedules is of course a big

[57:13]
like sleep schedules is of course a big

[57:13]
like sleep schedules is of course a big
thing.

[57:15]
thing.

[57:15]
thing.
So it's hard to give like clear advice

[57:18]
So it's hard to give like clear advice

[57:18]
So it's hard to give like clear advice
on that for if someone is living in X

[57:20]
on that for if someone is living in X

[57:20]
on that for if someone is living in X
place and they have this certain

[57:22]
place and they have this certain

[57:22]
place and they have this certain
schedules. Uh but thinking about all

[57:25]
schedules. Uh but thinking about all

[57:25]
schedules. Uh but thinking about all
those things the way you can optimize

[57:27]
those things the way you can optimize

[57:27]
those things the way you can optimize
that would probably be the the main

[57:29]
that would probably be the the main

[57:29]
that would probably be the the main
thing.

[57:31]
thing.

[57:31]
thing.
Um, other ways I guess

[57:35]
Um, other ways I guess

[57:35]
Um, other ways I guess
uh it sort of depends, you know, if

[57:38]
uh it sort of depends, you know, if

[57:38]
uh it sort of depends, you know, if
you're a full-time player or or

[57:40]
you're a full-time player or or

you're a full-time player or or
part-time how or you know, recreational

if you're looking at these. So, you can

[57:46]
if you're looking at these. So, you can

[57:46]
if you're looking at these. So, you can
maybe plan how your series is going to

[57:48]
maybe plan how your series is going to

[57:48]
maybe plan how your series is going to
look. You can look at the schedule,

[57:49]
look. You can look at the schedule,

[57:49]
look. You can look at the schedule,
think what the events that I want to

[57:51]
think what the events that I want to

[57:51]
think what the events that I want to
play. Are there events that I'm going to

[57:54]
play. Are there events that I'm going to

[57:54]
play. Are there events that I'm going to
prioritize? How much am I going to play

[57:57]
prioritize? How much am I going to play

[57:57]
prioritize? How much am I going to play
each day? Am I going to take any days

[58:00]
each day? Am I going to take any days

[58:00]
each day? Am I going to take any days
off? Things like

[58:02]
off? Things like

[58:02]
off? Things like
that. Um, so just to sort of plan and

[58:07]
that. Um, so just to sort of plan and

[58:07]
that. Um, so just to sort of plan and
envision how your weeks are going to

[58:09]
envision how your weeks are going to

[58:09]
envision how your weeks are going to
go. Then things like trying to make the

[58:14]
go. Then things like trying to make the

[58:14]
go. Then things like trying to make the
most of the 5 minute breaks. Try and

[58:18]
most of the 5 minute breaks. Try and

[58:18]
most of the 5 minute breaks. Try and
get, you know, meals sorted if you can

[58:21]
get, you know, meals sorted if you can

[58:21]
get, you know, meals sorted if you can
is a huge thing. How else are you going

[58:24]
is a huge thing. How else are you going

[58:24]
is a huge thing. How else are you going
to use them? Maybe are you going to have

[58:27]
to use them? Maybe are you going to have

[58:27]
to use them? Maybe are you going to have
little 4minute meditations packed in

[58:30]
little 4minute meditations packed in

[58:30]
little 4minute meditations packed in
something like this? Something that

[58:31]
something like this? Something that

[58:31]
something like this? Something that
you're going to be able

[58:33]
you're going to be able

[58:33]
you're going to be able
to

[58:34]
to

[58:34]
to
hopefully set you up better for each

[58:37]
hopefully set you up better for each

[58:37]
hopefully set you up better for each
next hour after this that 5 minute break

[58:39]
next hour after this that 5 minute break

[58:39]
next hour after this that 5 minute break
basically.

[58:41]
basically.

[58:41]
basically.
So these are I think quite important

[58:45]
So these are I think quite important

[58:45]
So these are I think quite important
that hopefully each person knows how

[58:49]
that hopefully each person knows how

that hopefully each person knows how
they work best in those environments so

they work best in those environments so

hard not to create a story around that.
And if you're not careful, expectations

[1:19:38]
And if you're not careful, expectations

that is setting you up for a fall

that is setting you up for a fall
because if you match that, you win. It's

because if you match that, you win. It's
like, yeah, I got the high that I

like, yeah, I got the high that I

[1:19:45]
like, yeah, I got the high that I
wanted, but anything below that feels

[1:19:47]
wanted, but anything below that feels

[1:19:47]
wanted, but anything below that feels
like a loss. So, you're creating this

[1:19:48]
like a loss. So, you're creating this

[1:19:48]
like a loss. So, you're creating this
kind of almost like moment where you're

[1:19:50]
kind of almost like moment where you're

[1:19:50]
kind of almost like moment where you're
going to drop from it most of the time.

a loss even though you might not you

[1:20:02]
a loss even though you might not you

a loss even though you might not you
might get a big score. So, I think that

[1:20:04]
might get a big score. So, I think that

[1:20:04]
might get a big score. So, I think that
is just watching it. As you mentioned,

[1:20:05]
is just watching it. As you mentioned,

[1:20:05]
is just watching it. As you mentioned,
try to be very careful not to get too

So it's it's trying to balance it in

[1:20:14]
So it's it's trying to balance it in

[1:20:14]
So it's it's trying to balance it in
real time because as soon as you get so

[1:20:16]
real time because as soon as you get so

[1:20:16]
real time because as soon as you get so
excited there will be a comedown. So as

[1:20:18]
excited there will be a comedown. So as

[1:20:18]
excited there will be a comedown. So as
soon as you allow the expectations to uh

think if I win how good I am. But often

[1:20:35]
think if I win how good I am. But often

[1:20:35]

it's on the negative side. How will they

[1:20:36]
it's on the negative side. How will they

Yeah, these things do generally remain

especially in different positions and

[2:13:29]
especially in different positions and

[2:13:29]
especially in different positions and
in tournaments, for example, you're

[2:13:33]
in tournaments, for example, you're

[2:13:33]
in tournaments, for example, you're
incentivized to deal the blinds. You're

obviously incentivized to accumulate

obviously incentivized to accumulate
chips. The blinds are going to go

[2:13:39]

up. you're trying to get chips from
winning the blinds. That's theoretically

[2:13:45]
winning the blinds. That's theoretically

[2:13:45]
winning the blinds. That's theoretically
the easiest way to win chips is if

games are even more incentivized to do

games are even more incentivized to do

[2:13:53]
games are even more incentivized to do
that actually because the blinds are

[2:13:55]
that actually because the blinds are

[2:13:55]
that actually because the blinds are
relatively doubled in that and they're

[2:13:59]
relatively doubled in that and they're

[2:13:59]
relatively doubled in that and they're
just relatively even more important. So

[2:14:02]
just relatively even more important. So

[2:14:02]
just relatively even more important. So
winning blinds that way is more

changes is there's no more public cards,

[2:26:13]
changes is there's no more public cards,

[2:26:14]
changes is there's no more public cards,
but you get all cards dealt to you.

but you get all cards dealt to you.

[2:26:16]
but you get all cards dealt to you.
Correct.

[2:26:18]
Correct.

[2:26:18]
Correct.
Correct. So start two down cards, one

Correct. So start two down cards, one
up. Everyone can see your up card. So

more information this way. This is

[2:26:27]
more information this way. This is

[2:26:27]
more information this way. This is
important to try and remember that

[2:26:29]
important to try and remember that

[2:26:29]
important to try and remember that
information. So if you're a beginner to

[2:26:31]
information. So if you're a beginner to

[2:26:31]
information. So if you're a beginner to
stud, then you want to try to remember

[2:26:34]
stud, then you want to try to remember

[2:26:34]
stud, then you want to try to remember
what other people's up cards are cuz

[2:26:35]
what other people's up cards are cuz

[2:26:36]
what other people's up cards are cuz
then you just have more information. You

[2:26:37]
then you just have more information. You

[2:26:37]
then you just have more information. You
know the seven of spades is there or you

[2:26:39]
know the seven of spades is there or you

[2:26:39]

know this person has their ace of clubs.

[2:26:42]
know this person has their ace of clubs.

[2:26:42]
know this person has their ace of clubs.
So it's less person less likely that

[2:26:45]
So it's less person less likely that

[2:26:45]
So it's less person less likely that
this other person has a pair of aces if

[2:26:47]
this other person has a pair of aces if

[2:26:48]
this other person has a pair of aces if
they're in the other seat. So this is

[2:26:51]
they're in the other seat. So this is

[2:26:51]
they're in the other seat. So this is
obviously going to be valuable to you.

[2:26:53]
obviously going to be valuable to you.

[2:26:53]
obviously going to be valuable to you.

you know it's very unlikely they've

[2:27:07]
you know it's very unlikely they've

[2:27:07]
you know it's very unlikely they've
paired their five.

[2:27:09]
paired their five.

[2:27:09]
paired their five.
So these kind of reasons where it's

So these kind of reasons where it's
important and

[2:27:13]
important and

[2:27:13]
important and
then yeah you get the next three cards

[2:27:17]
then yeah you get the next three cards

[2:27:17]
then yeah you get the next three cards
all up. So fourth, fifth and sixth as

[2:27:19]
all up. So fourth, fifth and sixth as

[2:27:19]
all up. So fourth, fifth and sixth as
you would call it up and then seventh is

[2:27:22]
you would call it up and then seventh is

[2:27:22]
you would call it up and then seventh is
face down. So to you uh personally and

[2:27:27]
face down. So to you uh personally and

[2:27:27]
face down. So to you uh personally and
then there are anties everybody anties

[2:27:31]
then there are anties everybody anties

[2:27:31]
then there are anties everybody anties
and there is uh what's called a bringin.

[2:27:35]
and there is uh what's called a bringin.

[2:27:35]
and there is uh what's called a bringin.
So it's the worst up card brings in

[2:27:40]
So it's the worst up card brings in

[2:27:40]
So it's the worst up card brings in
where the action is then going to start

[2:27:43]
where the action is then going to start

[2:27:43]
where the action is then going to start
from there. It's almost like a blind.

[2:27:44]
from there. It's almost like a blind.

[2:27:44]
from there. It's almost like a blind.
It's a forced bet. So in start

[2:27:49]
It's a forced bet. So in start

[2:27:49]
It's a forced bet. So in start
high the worst possible card is a deuce

[2:27:52]
high the worst possible card is a deuce

[2:27:52]
high the worst possible card is a deuce
of clubs. The suits also go in

[2:27:55]
of clubs. The suits also go in

[2:27:55]
of clubs. The suits also go in
alphabetical order where clubs is the

[2:27:57]
alphabetical order where clubs is the

[2:27:57]
alphabetical order where clubs is the
worst. So if someone else has a deuce of

[2:28:01]
worst. So if someone else has a deuce of

[2:28:01]
worst. So if someone else has a deuce of
spades, another person has a deuce of

[2:28:02]
spades, another person has a deuce of

[2:28:02]
spades, another person has a deuce of
clubs. The deuce of clubs is the bringin

[2:28:05]
clubs. The deuce of clubs is the bringin

[2:28:05]
clubs. The deuce of clubs is the bringin
and they're going to put in some amount.

[2:28:06]
and they're going to put in some amount.

[2:28:06]
and they're going to put in some amount.
Let's say it's two

[2:28:08]
Let's say it's two

[2:28:08]
Let's say it's two
anties of an amount and then action goes

[2:28:11]
anties of an amount and then action goes

[2:28:11]
anties of an amount and then action goes
from the person straight after the bring

[2:28:15]
from the person straight after the bring

[2:28:15]
from the person straight after the bring
in and it goes around in that same

clockwise order.

[2:28:20]
clockwise order.

So again, this is where positions are

it depends on people's up cards. So if

the bring in is a deuce then it is left

the bring in is a deuce then it is left
of the sorry left of the ring then it is

[2:28:51]
of the sorry left of the ring then it is

[2:28:51]
of the sorry left of the ring then it is
a deuce and then everybody else has uh

kings and queens then they could steal

[2:28:57]
kings and queens then they could steal

[2:28:57]
kings and queens then they could steal
very liberally. So you'd still probably

[2:28:59]
very liberally. So you'd still probably

[2:28:59]
very liberally. So you'd still probably
call it a steal in that regard, but it's

[2:29:02]
call it a steal in that regard, but it's

[2:29:02]
call it a steal in that regard, but it's
obviously like a very favorable board.

[2:29:03]
obviously like a very favorable board.

[2:29:04]
obviously like a very favorable board.
Same with start high. If the person

So that's kind of the bluffing. You're

none of them have ever played it before,

[2:40:44]
none of them have ever played it before,

none of them have ever played it before,
I think that would be great. Genuinely.

I think that would be great. Genuinely.
Uh even for me, I remember that was

well is also one of my best games where

[2:41:17]
uh less about bluffing there like it's

you're essentially deciding if you want

to draw to and have equity from the draw

[2:41:53]

gain in order to now essentially bluff.

[2:41:58]
gain in order to now essentially bluff.
And

[2:41:59]
And

[2:41:59]
And
then most typically bluffs are going to

[2:42:02]
then most typically bluffs are going to

[2:42:02]
then most typically bluffs are going to
come after you have drawn whether it's

player has drawn one on the third draw.

[2:42:11]
player has drawn one on the third draw.

[2:42:11]
player has drawn one on the third draw.
So it's triple draw their three draws

[2:42:13]
So it's triple draw their three draws

[2:42:13]
So it's triple draw their three draws

[3:07:29]
happy on that pursuit. So then you start
to balance it with do I feel happy? Am I

through of what you're trying to achieve
because that's that's kind of the the

[3:07:48]
because that's that's kind of the the

because that's that's kind of the the
nature of poker players trying to

[3:07:49]
nature of poker players trying to

to balance that with a a successful life

[3:07:52]
to balance that with a a successful life

[3:07:52]
to balance that with a a successful life
in terms of a happy life. So yeah, I

[3:07:54]
in terms of a happy life. So yeah, I

[3:07:54]
in terms of a happy life. So yeah, I
like that you came full circle and I

[3:07:55]
like that you came full circle and I

[3:07:55]
like that you came full circle and I
think I like was it was a rounded

[3:07:56]
think I like was it was a rounded

[3:07:56]
think I like was it was a rounded
answer. So I was going to say people's

[3:07:57]
answer. So I was going to say people's

[3:07:58]
answer. So I was going to say people's
goalposts move all the time for what

[3:07:59]
goalposts move all the time for what

[3:07:59]
goalposts move all the time for what
they want to achieve and what they might

[3:08:01]
they want to achieve and what they might

[3:08:01]
they want to achieve and what they might
deem successful. like they might have

[3:08:02]
deem successful. like they might have

[3:08:02]
deem successful. like they might have
achieved something and then still want

[3:08:05]
achieved something and then still want

[3:08:05]
achieved something and then still want
to achieve the next thing after they've

[3:08:07]
to achieve the next thing after they've

[3:08:07]
to achieve the next thing after they've
done that already and realize like that

[3:08:09]
done that already and realize like that

[3:08:09]
done that already and realize like that
didn't make them happy or they didn't

[3:08:12]
didn't make them happy or they didn't

[3:08:12]
didn't make them happy or they didn't
quantify that as success but they want

[3:08:13]
quantify that as success but they want

[3:08:13]
quantify that as success but they want
the next thing or like they're not

[3:08:15]
the next thing or like they're not

[3:08:15]
the next thing or like they're not
successful enough like these kind of

[3:08:16]
successful enough like these kind of

[3:08:16]
successful enough like these kind of
things. So it's important to be able to

[3:08:20]
things. So it's important to be able to

[3:08:20]
things. So it's important to be able to
recognize that how it shifts and when

[3:08:23]
recognize that how it shifts and when

[3:08:23]
recognize that how it shifts and when
that changes then happiness is probably

[3:08:26]
that changes then happiness is probably

[3:08:26]
that changes then happiness is probably
the kind of most important thing. Yeah.

[3:08:31]
the kind of most important thing. Yeah.

[3:08:31]
the kind of most important thing. Yeah.
Yeah, I think as well with that it's
