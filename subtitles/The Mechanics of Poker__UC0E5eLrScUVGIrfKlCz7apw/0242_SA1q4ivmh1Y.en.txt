If you're envisioning an ex person
watching a replay being like, "What the
hell is he doing? This is so bad."
Realistically, you're somehow able to be
at peace and accepting of people
thinking you're terrible. Then it's not
going to hold you back. Today, we will

[00:15]
going to hold you back. Today, we will
be chatting with mixed game specialist
Benny Glazer. Benny is a reigning
champion for most Scoop and W titles won
and has dominated the World Series of
Poker by winning five bracelets.
Thankfully for Scoop and WC, they have
the dedicated day off on Friday. I

[00:31]
the dedicated day off on Friday. I
absolutely always take that day off. I
think it would be borderline insanity
not to. I'm playing a final table and
it's 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. for me rather
than like 1 or 2 a.m. in Europe, for
example. So, I think that's important

[00:45]
example. So, I think that's important
for you. How do you make sure your focus
is where you want it to be for final
tables late in the grind? things that I
used to do that I think made it
something tougher for me. Post on social
media that I made a final table because
you know I want to be like this is you
know cool thing like support is nice but

[01:01]
know cool thing like support is nice but
I realized that even things surrounding
that probably adds things to me and to
my brain that it probably hinders me
especially like I might get messages
coming in about it and it's like a
distraction. Heads up. It's a tough game

[01:15]
distraction. Heads up. It's a tough game
and like you know you just you can't
hide. Definitely kind of made me
question my ability a lot in some
aspects. What do you actually do? Do you
have like a SOS [ __ ] Nothing worked.
What do I do? I have to perform in 5
minutes. Screaming is great if you have

[01:32]
minutes. Screaming is great if you have
the chance. Shout into a pillow if
there's someone for for 20 seconds is
beautiful way to get out some tilt if
you really want to.

ado, guys, enjoy this episode. Benny, I
was going over your uh Handm and
something actually stood out to me about

[02:15]
something actually stood out to me about
your recent results. I saw that on March
6th you final table 100k at Poker Go,
won a nice little 225K, but just one
month later you're in Brati Slava
playing a €250 and a 400 euro mixed game
event. You must really love this game.

[02:33]
event. You must really love this game.
Yeah, that was uh a bit of fun really.
Um, it wasn't exactly for the uh money
and EV that I went there really. That
was more kind of a social stop with

[02:46]
was more kind of a social stop with
friends. Um, but yeah, mixed games are
fun generally. I prefer them live and I
like supporting them. I thought that was
going to be a good environment to do
that. And yeah, it was nice to kind of

[03:01]
that. And yeah, it was nice to kind of
show my face there and support the
Norwegian guys as well. the big advocate
for mixed games. Uh so it's because I
guess in the bigger stops you're kind of
forced to play more no limit hold them
even though you prefer mixed games
simply because they don't offer enough

[03:15]
simply because they don't offer enough
mixed games. Yeah, absolutely. Like I I
definitely would rather play more mixed
games if I could or
probably only if I could if that's all
they offered. But yeah, sort of
subjected to have to play them as well.

[03:30]
subjected to have to play them as well.
what make poker such a great game and
what attracted you to it? So, initially
some of the things that attracted me to
it was just the mental challenge of it
where I'm trying to get better just both
as myself as a way of improving and

[03:47]
as myself as a way of improving and
essentially trying to just be better
than other people, trying to outsmart
them. uh the challenge of trying to work
that out, trying to work out how to be
better than someone at the game is

[04:01]
better than someone at the game is
something that attracted me to it, as
well as obviously the potential money
earning side of it. Um,
but in that way that it's just a a
pure outwitting someone else game that

[04:16]
pure outwitting someone else game that
it's just a cerebral game is what uh
attracted me to it and is what I think
makes it a great game.
you said the first thing you said that
it's like a challenge against yourself

[04:31]
it's like a challenge against yourself
whereas you know I often feel like a lot
of people need a
certain level of opposition to get like
into flow right to play well but you
know you were out there in Bratislava
playing a 250 event 400 event and now
you're also talking about you know the

[04:45]
you're also talking about you know the
challenge is actually against yourself
do you feel like you you you are able to
find your a a game purely from
challenging yourself or do you still
need like some sort of level of
competition to really get in the zone.

[05:01]
Yeah, good question. I I would say in
generally in Bratislava and the kind of
small ones I probably also playing my a
game. Um although there were like a
couple of like very skilled players who
who were in there still as well. Um that

[05:15]
who were in there still as well. Um that
still provided a challenge. For example,
who I got uh three-handed with is also
very good.
Um but yeah, I think my agame generally
would rise to when the competition is

[05:30]
would rise to when the competition is
best.
Um, at least I I think
so in general like I can maybe default
to a more theoretical kind of
fundamentally sound game rather than if

[05:47]
fundamentally sound game rather than if
you call like a game might be like in a
way of taking every possible kind of
edge finding every little exploit in a
way as well. So it depends how hard I
might be trying to do that too.

[06:02]
when you say uh your biggest opponent uh
actually I think it was a a Conor
McGregor quote actually that that said
like the biggest opponent is yourself.
Uh I'm pretty sure actually uh when you
play against Benny what is the biggest

[06:15]
play against Benny what is the biggest
challenge?
When you say you being me right as
opposed to the royal you. No. So like
you you said like the basically the if
we think about you know we obviously we

[06:30]
we think about you know we obviously we
have the opposition that we have to beat
but we also have to beat kind of the
game with ourselves right the game in
our mind. Uh so what's what's tough
about uh about the challenge Benny? So
uh to clarify you're kind of asking what

[06:45]
uh to clarify you're kind of asking what
my obstacles that I face about myself
like where I might be holding myself
back in a way.
Yeah,
tough questions. I would say uh these
days probably my answer is changed to

[07:00]
days probably my answer is changed to
what it would be in the past. I think in
a way one thing is my motivation and
hunger for poker playing isn't what it
it used to be. So it's a challenge for
me to kind of motivate myself to be

[07:17]
me to kind of motivate myself to be
getting out there to be studying as
well. So, it's a challenge for me to
just be studying as much as I should
probably. Um, so that's something that

[07:31]
probably. Um, so that's something that
holds me back. Like my motivation there,
uh,
probably holds me back from being as
good as I could be these days.
Um, something else that holds me back,

[07:47]
Um, something else that holds me back,
they're probably just still like certain
mental leaks I have. I think
uh in a
way maybe there are spots that I'm
trying to be too theoretically sound and

[08:03]
trying to be too theoretically sound and
not taking every exploit spot. For
example, so we were just talking about
there. Um,
if I have occasionally
[Music]

[08:15]
[Music]
uh insecurities of what people might
think sometimes. That's something that
held me back before where I didn't want
to look like an idiot in some ways. Um,
that's held me back in the past as well

[08:30]
that's held me back in the past as well
for my poker strategy in general like is
why I would maybe
default mortar theoretically sound plays
I think could objectively be seen as
good rather than like trying to take
every spot and worry about some like

[08:47]
every spot and worry about some like
giving me some strange face for whatever
I've done. So those are definitely a few
things that have helped me held me back
more in the past. Yeah.
Yeah. I definitely think the biggest
challenge we have if we think about uh

[09:01]
challenge we have if we think about uh
the greatest opponent being ourselves is
indeed like that inner dialogue, right?
I can actually I can definitely relate
to what you're saying that you almost
default to kind of making the play that
everyone agrees on is good because if
you do something else you basically say
to everyone you guys all suck you I know

[09:17]
to everyone you guys all suck you I know
it better. Uh so you you need you need a
certain level of confidence right your
your mojo has to be on in order to to
really roll with that. Um you said that
you know probably also part of the

[09:30]
you know probably also part of the
reason why you like mixed games is that
you like kind of the poker puzzle right?
You like to figure things out, try to
discover how things work, how certain
games work. Um, you also enjoy the
competitive aspect, beating people, like
you said, especially beating people for
money. When did you first discover that

[09:46]
money. When did you first discover that
part of yourself, like that you were so
competitive? Like, did the kids in uh
did did the kids in school learn that
their lunch money was not safe if Benny
was around? God. Yeah, I think that's
probably very young.

[10:01]
probably very young.
Um, trying to think. I was competitive
in a lot of ways.
Uh, actually, God, that reminds me. I I
used to play even some chess when I was
very young. I was probably like 10, 11.

[10:18]
very young. I was probably like 10, 11.
And then
I basically was the best in my class at
the time and then just stopped playing.
because of that it wasn't like another
challenge or competition. So I just

[10:32]
challenge or competition. So I just
stopped and like I wasn't that good at
it but it was just remember being
competitive in that way like it was just
a small class that was just something
that I randomly remembered. Um the other
thing was probably sports. I was most

[10:46]
thing was probably sports. I was most
competitive in. I used to do a lot of
sports uh various teams at school like
throughout
uh my school days from like uh 10 up
until 18 for example. I was in like the

[11:01]
until 18 for example. I was in like the
bon teams at my school and university
trying to compete uh a lot at those. And
yeah, I think probably just games in
general, board games, I would always
take I guess somewhat seriously or like

[11:15]
take I guess somewhat seriously or like
just be competitive at Yeah. You
probably Monopoly or whatever. Yeah.
Did you ever take that competition too
far? Maybe in a setting that wasn't
really appropriate, like, you know,
Monopoly. Monopoly with the family.

[11:30]
Monopoly. Monopoly with the family.
I would imagine I probably got into some
arguments in the family. It was some
kind of Monopoly type games here. uh
nothing stands out but yeah I could
imagine like there was some tensions
there. What is it about competition like

[11:47]
there. What is it about competition like
what does it bring out in you?
I I think there is the aspect of it I

[12:00]
I I think there is the aspect of it I
guess being against myself and
uh
potentially improving like seeing
improvement I enjoy. I find that to be
satisfying in general.
just seeing how you're improving and

[12:16]
just seeing how you're improving and
progressing and I think having some kind
of competitive hunger is better for that
in
general.
Um I I mean I guess I just also enjoy

[12:30]
Um I I mean I guess I just also enjoy
that aspect of winning frankly. Um I
think that's probably just been quite
natural to me. Um, it wasn't
necessarily something that I just like
seek to do, but I think it's always just
been quite natural to me.

[12:48]
been quite natural to me.
Um, so something else. I'm I'm sure
there's probably more to it than that. I
can't
really think right now. Um, but yeah,
maybe the kind of just friendly thing as

[13:00]
maybe the kind of just friendly thing as
well of like kind of victory against
friends or something as well. Yeah.
I think most uh most people can relate
to that one. Like when I was younger,
any any game if you can beat your
friends, it's nice to rub it in, you
know? It's uh f some friendly banter,

[13:17]
know? It's uh f some friendly banter,
right? Uh yeah, definitely definitely
makes games more enjoyable. You
mentioned already you play chess,
competitive in badminton. When did uh
poker first come on your radar?
So poker first was when I was about 14,

[13:33]
So poker first was when I was about 14,
15. Uh when I saw uh my dad playing some
online money and then I was interested
in like play money from there and

[13:46]
in like play money from there and
started on that trying to figure
out strategies and actually kind of
enjoying trying to figure out strategies
that I think could be
the I was going to say profitable but

[14:01]
the I was going to say profitable but
like
just useful more advanced things just
trying to work things out myself. Uh
that I found that to be more though like
my dad is sort of just kind of content

[14:16]
my dad is sort of just kind of content
playing whatever kind of just like
clicking buttons
without too much thought I guess and uh
yeah I was more intrigued by that whole
kind of cerebral aspect of it.

[14:30]
kind of cerebral aspect of it.
Do you recall any like first uh
strategic breakthroughs for yourself or
like hey this is this is this is
starting to look like something
there was probably one in particular I
was like trying to work out advanced
bluffs and I I remembered when I sort of

[14:45]
bluffs and I I remembered when I sort of
like found the check race like wow this
is a thing and like uh or even like
check call flop to check raise turn I
was like wow this is kind of the next
level more advanced kind of bluffs and
this is again when I'm like 15, I'd

[15:00]
this is again when I'm like 15, I'd
never spoken to anybody else about
poker. This is just like me thinking
about things to myself that I was just
like or uh like even a like a flop float
to to check to raise a turn somehow. I'm
like, "Yeah, this is kind of really

[15:15]
like, "Yeah, this is kind of really
getting in there." So, I think that was
probably the first sort of thing I
remember in my mind that I was getting
excited about. This is something I'm
actually like figuring out. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, like obviously you know when

[15:30]
Yeah. Yeah, like obviously you know when
you have no when you're not in the poker
world right you haven't consumed
anything many ideas that you have you
know might be based on nothing but on
the other side your mind is still very
open right you're not yet programmed
because I feel like a lot of the
learning that sometimes you have to do
is unlearn some bad habit that you had

[15:46]
is unlearn some bad habit that you had
so like the benefits in the beginning
said you're still so open-minded
actually you mentioned the float I I
recall actually very very early I was
not pro yet I had the same it's like ah
if there's an ASAP board and I call
people think I have an ace. So I would
just start floating ace high boards

[16:01]
just start floating ace high boards
because when I call they have an ace and
they give up and then I can bluff later
on. It's pretty advanced concept, right?
If we think about floating already when
you were 15 I was not 15 but like very
early maybe I was 20 or something you
know and later I would just call I

[16:15]
know and later I would just call I
remember if I would call lowboard I
would call call then people would put me
on a set because I called twice and then
I could rep later on. This is probably
one or two years later. Uh uh but yeah
it is fun how how uh having un

[16:31]
it is fun how how uh having un
unprogrammed mind right based on common
things that people think about program
and like the the kind of creative ideas
that you can come up with. Uh do you
still
labor yourself as like a a creative

[16:45]
labor yourself as like a a creative
mind? Do you try to preserve your
creativity in some sort of way?
In a way, I I would like to think so. I
I was remembering other like nonsense

[17:00]
I was remembering other like nonsense
things even when like I had started like
the earliest days of like real money
when I was 18 and it'll just be things
like you know if someone opens or like
three bets whatever you know you have
aces just literally go in like just go

[17:15]
aces just literally go in like just go
in for 100 plus and I was like this is
genius you know uh every time they three
and then you know they would never fold
queens or whatever and it was just like
happen all the time. And I remember
these kind of things just thinking about

[17:31]
these kind of things just thinking about
that where I was thinking at the time
like I was feeling creative about these
things and uh just working out these
kind of
strategies these days.

[17:45]
strategies these days.
Uh I think mostly no limit sadly.
Well, probably sadly I I generally
default to more kind of theoretical game
where there's not so much room for
creativity. I guess you can get into

[18:01]
creativity. I guess you can get into
like the no lock streets or whatever if
you'd like. Um,
but in a way that sort of made me sad
that it was more
about memorization for things more these

[18:17]
about memorization for things more these
days than just really kind of creativity
and really just using your your brain as
much as you can versus your opponent's
brain and not hoping they've seen
whatever charts that they remembered as
well.

[18:30]
well.
Um, so for no limit
especially
I don't think I am slash have been very
creative in the last years. Um, mix
games I think I still try to be

[18:46]
games I think I still try to be
creative. I think there's still like
some cool maneuverable spots and things
like that. Uh, especially in tournaments
that I've thought a lot about and I
think I do still have edges there in
certain ways.

[19:00]
certain ways.
Um, but I think maybe generally these
days I would have my creative outlets
maybe in somewhere outside of poker like
music or something.

[19:15]
music or something.
Is that because uh like the other games
compared to No Limit Hold them are less
solved and therefore there's more brain
solving, right? More the brain versus
brain aspect comes out more. Yeah, I
think so. That's sort of the main thing
that I think there's more room

[19:32]
that I think there's more room
for exploits generally and more also
kind of maneuverability in certain ways
as well. Um,
and you know things like the sort of
cool things you can do at shorter stack

[19:46]
cool things you can do at shorter stack
depths as well that lots of
people haven't necessarily thought about
too much as well. Um
but yeah the the people who are just
brain solving there I would like to
think I have decent edge in certain ways

[20:03]
think I have decent edge in certain ways
where I have thought or seen solves.
Yeah.
Your main uh your main expertise
nowadays is indeed like mixed games.
What what game did you start out poker
with and how did that evolve into a

[20:16]
with and how did that evolve into a
passion for the entire mixed game
selection?
I started with
uh Holden both limit and no limit.
So from

[20:33]
So from
uh yeah 15 or so that was all I had seen
and then by the way I I sort of took a
break when I was like 16 and 17 after
this. So, it wasn't until I was like 18

[20:46]
this. So, it wasn't until I was like 18
or so when I was sort of back
in playing a pub game or something or
playing with my housemates and things
like that. It's where
uh I started playing again. And then the
next game I found from there was uh PL8

[21:03]
next game I found from there was uh PL8
back when I was online probably 19. I
think that was one game that I found
really interesting. I thought that had a
lot of room for kind of maneuverability
and creativity in certain ways too. I

[21:17]
and creativity in certain ways too. I
think that's just in general a pretty
cool poker game.
Did you you mentioned you know you
playing with with friends pop 18. When
when did you decide to go pro? Mhm.

[21:32]
when did you decide to go pro? Mhm.
So, it was
probably I was about 23ish when I was uh
full-time pro, maybe 22. Um, but I was
sort of I
guess part-time pro, I guess around 21,

[21:48]
guess part-time pro, I guess around 21,
22.
So, it was quite a slow. Were there any
moments were there any moments like
after you decided, okay, I'm going to
play this for a living? I guess you were
playing PL 8 then as well. That's what

[22:01]
playing PL 8 then as well. That's what
the game that you decided on playing for
a living in in the beginning.
Um, no. So that was the first mixed game
that I had found and then sort of the
next couple of years I'd found some

[22:16]
next couple of years I'd found some
more. So I think I
was 19 20 when I had found full tilt and
then kind of opened the scope of all the
mix games and everything there. So it
was kind of eight game there. That was

[22:32]
was kind of eight game there. That was
the big thing at that time. So I was
interested in those and then yeah I
think 22
um mostly part-time in kind of like
heads up sit and goes things like that.
So I was playing like limit holdm heads

[22:46]
So I was playing like limit holdm heads
up 08 heads up a game heads up those
kind of things.
So you started playing uh heads up
sitting goes when you were playing for a
living. Were there any moments when you
questioned the decision of doing this

[23:00]
questioned the decision of doing this
for a living? Yeah, absolutely. Um
I I mean when I was still part-time, I'd
sort of still like left scope for myself
to be doing other things. I wasn't
really all in on it, but it was uh a lot

[23:19]
really all in on it, but it was uh a lot
of my time. And yeah, I remember times
in the heads up grind, but it was kind
of really rough. I definitely had some
like miserable times like the variance

[23:30]
like miserable times like the variance
there is just crazy and heads up is a
tough game and like you know you just
you can't hide in the heads up
and definitely kind of made me question
my ability a lot in some aspects where

[23:48]
my ability a lot in some aspects where
you know I'd had uh rough patches losing
streaks
where sort of makes me self-doubt and
question myself like am
I as good as

[24:01]
I as good as
I think is going to be profitable in
this game? Am I still being ex person?
Uh sort of trying to examine that and
that was tough for me that kind of
self-reflection and doubt. So

[24:15]
self-reflection and doubt. So
uh yeah, that was
um a tough period I guess before I kind
of transition to other things too.
What did this time of struggle teach you

[24:32]
What did this time of struggle teach you
that you think set you up for a long and
successful poker career?
Yeah, I think it taught
me to to actually focus on your leaks in

[24:47]
me to to actually focus on your leaks in
a way. Heads Up is just a game
where it's a like very it becomes
clearer what your leaks are in a way.
So, uh rather than sort

[25:03]
So, uh rather than sort
of hiding from your leaks or just sort
of pretending or hoping something
doesn't
exist, you're kind of going to be
battered by repetition in those from the
number of hands you're playing. So

[25:16]
number of hands you're playing. So
obviously heads up, you're just playing
so many more hands. You're putting into
put into more difficult spots
and it benefits your game more to focus
on those leaks to have those become

[25:32]
on those leaks to have those become
better rather than just kind of
uh focus on things you think you might
be good at and just like make your
strengths a tiny bit better rather than
like really trying to bring the worst
parts of your game up. and really trying

[25:46]
parts of your game up. and really trying
to focus on those and uh it
really tried to like I really try to be
realistic in those times about my
ability and where I'm kind of strong or

[26:00]
ability and where I'm kind of strong or
where I might not be. So like the the
self-awareness there I think that taught
me was really important.
um trying to be as self-aware as I can
and trying to examine where I think I

[26:15]
and trying to examine where I think I
might uh not be good or you know even
for example in the heads up hierarchy as
it were that you sort of might know your
place if like you can beat all these
people but you can't beat this person um
then it's sort of important to not be

[26:31]
then it's sort of important to not be
deluded in your ability thinking you can
beat this person and just play them when
you're losing money obviously. Uh
so that's also just an important thing
to kind of have your confidence in check

[26:47]
to kind of have your confidence in check
in a way uh and potentially keep your
ego out of it. Um so yeah, I think
trying to be realistic about my skill,
trying to kind of not be deluded about

[27:00]
trying to kind of not be deluded about
things like that and be rational about
things and critically examine, those
were all important things I learned.
In the beginning, uh, you were grinding
mainly online. Uh, but when AP came to

[27:15]
mainly online. Uh, but when AP came to
town, I saw your hand them up. You
started to dip your toes in those as
well with some some cashes, I think, in
the in the London EPs. I saw then in
2015, you got your first WSP bracelet in
the Duca 7 triple dough. Nowadays, you
seem to prefer live more than online.

[27:31]
seem to prefer live more than online.
Why is that? And how was the transition
from online to live for you?
Yeah. So firstly the
transition I think was was tough for me

[27:46]
transition I think was was tough for me
in some ways.
[Music]
Uh I I think particularly mixed games
like I had
taken a a break
from live games in a way

[28:02]
from live games in a way
uh since the kind
of pub days. So, you know, when I was
playing back in the pub leagues and and
it's all sort of fun and like the the

[28:17]
it's all sort of fun and like the the
atmosphere is obviously very different
to anything in like real competitive,
you know, it's it's self-def. felt like
these kind of things. Um it's very
different and then it was

[28:30]
different and then it was
probably years later I don't know when
maybe 23 or 24 so when
uh I really got back into live
properly. Um and

[28:45]
properly. Um and
then yeah that was quite a shift just
both basic things
like counting pot size you know these
kind of things that you just have to get
used to obviously
um that I definitely felt like a bit of

[29:03]
um that I definitely felt like a bit of
a fish at those times. uh even if I'm
you know I've been successful online I'm
still like taking some getting used to
online and sorry taking some getting
used to live and then these days yeah

[29:20]
used to live and then these days yeah
online doesn't appeal to me as much as
it used to sadly
um I do prefer the social aspect of it
these days and

[29:31]
these days and
uh I find online generally to be a kind
of a more insular
experience
and
less fulfilling in that way too. I did

[29:45]
less fulfilling in that way too. I did
used to enjoy it more, but it it sadly
doesn't appeal to me as much as it used
to unless sort of the the special series
I I'd care more about. But generally the
random tournaments uh not so much. as

[30:00]
random tournaments uh not so much. as
well as like it's just clearly gotten
tougher in like every way
and I think live games generally are
still thriving in most aspects. So
generally from an Eevee point of view uh

[30:17]
generally from an Eevee point of view uh
in terms of stakes of buyins as well and
skill there then I think they're
generally better spots.
the the first bracelet you won 2015 DA 7

[30:31]
the the first bracelet you won 2015 DA 7
triple draw. Did that uh confirm your
uh your your preference towards life?
You're like oh I can imagine that like
with you know the TV you hold the brace
the money in the table you know it's

[30:45]
the money in the table you know it's
it's it's the whole experience right
compared to online. Did that really make
you addicted to the live the life rush?
Yeah it did. That was quite a a kind of
breakthrough thing for me. I think uh it

[31:00]
breakthrough thing for me. I think uh it
was
both like both, you know, obviously it's
the the bankroll boost that I felt like
very good about and it was really like
the confidence that I got from it as
well. I think that that whole year

[31:18]
well. I think that that whole year
that obviously it's like one tournament
doesn't really mean much but uh it just
felt in my mind like it was quite
cementing to me to be sort of like this

[31:32]
cementing to me to be sort of like this
is you know my my full-time job now
basically it's like no okay
I'm more legitimacy in that way So, you
know, I had held World Series in high

[31:47]
know, I had held World Series in high
esteem and like prestige and it just
like felt like, okay, this is legitimate
in terms of like sort of arriving and
like belonging here in that way.
So yeah, that absolutely felt to me like

[32:00]
So yeah, that absolutely felt to me like
it was kind of a substantial time and
live obviously the yeah publicity as you
say it's it's a real attraction and it
feels a lot more just like legitimate in
terms of real world aspects than online.

[32:15]
terms of real world aspects than online.
Yeah.
You mentioned the big bankroll boost.
How like in general I think uh you
mentioned that you're a creative player.
Uh we talked about confidence in general
a big struggle and things for example

[32:30]
a big struggle and things for example
that I've seen coaching people. The
biggest bottlenecks always like finances
pressure. How did poker or your
experiences playing poker professionally
feel different after you had this bankro
boost? Did that relieve like some
stress? Were you able to enjoy the grind

[32:45]
stress? Were you able to enjoy the grind
more? I guess it relieved stress in the
way that I had now felt more
comfortable.
Um,
and the ability to just move up in
stakes. Like I was playing quite low

[33:00]
stakes. Like I was playing quite low
stakes online at the time relative to
that. Like really I was still probably
playing
like 48 limits and those are like
relatively low stakes. They're like
pretty tough stakes to make a living at,
frankly. Um, so to win my bracelet at

[33:19]
frankly. Um, so to win my bracelet at
that time was big. Like I was able to
move up in stakes. That was really nice.
And
um, sorry, what was the other part of

[33:31]
um, sorry, what was the other part of
your question
before? No, like if it's if it kind of
then set you free. You mentioned that in
the beginning, you know, you're still, I
guess, you were to a certain degree
dependent on how poker was doing to
finance your life, but kind of now that

[33:46]
finance your life, but kind of now that
it sounded like that score set you free
from that, so you could just purely
focus on, I don't know, enjoying the
game, the competitive aspect. You didn't
have to worry about the money anymore.
I guess I wouldn't say I wouldn't didn't

[34:00]
I guess I wouldn't say I wouldn't didn't
worry about the money anymore. I still
did. like it wasn't like it was a
million dollar score something
relatively speaking but it did
uh make my life better too at that time
in terms of like actual real world money

[34:15]
in terms of like actual real world money
it was still meaningful to me when I was
you know
uh basically living with my parents at
the time it was meaningful to me then uh
also I think it did feel like it was
nice

[34:31]
nice
for even like my parents to see that
legitimacy like okay you know he can
have this as his profession and his job
like this like both like he has the
potential to make money and like he's
probably actually good at it and he can

[34:46]
probably actually good at it and he can
like beat you know other world class
players in Vegas like these kind of
things so I think that was nice in a way
probably relieved a bit of pressure
there too as well that they just felt
more comfortable with that situation as
well I

[35:02]
Yeah, I remember showing my parents. I
think one of the first interviews that I
did. I was I went to a live stop in the
Netherlands. I was just known as an
uncle online kid, right? But in the
Netherlands, they didn't know who I was.
So, they dragged me in front of the
camera. That's when the first time I

[35:15]
camera. That's when the first time I
could show to my parents like look, they
interviewed me like, "Oh, they
interviewed you. Oh, they they must be a
big thing, right?" It's kind of the
similar where you get where where you're
on TV and you can say, "Look, I'm on
TV." And then your parents think, "Well,
then I guess you made it, right?" That's
kind of the the definition. Um, Adam,

[35:32]
kind of the the definition. Um, Adam,
like we already touched on it a little
bit.
Um, the pressure of, for example, the
need to prove your prove yourself or to
kind of validate that poker was a good

[35:45]
kind of validate that poker was a good
decision. Uh, same with the money
pressure. How do these kind of outside
factors influence someone's ability to
play poker and to enjoy poker? And how
do you think those two uh go hand in

[36:00]
do you think those two uh go hand in
hand?
Yeah, I think they play a huge role. If
you look at most poker players getting
into it, we're quite young generally
early 20s, maybe mid20s on average, and
you want to prove to yourself you can
make money. So the first thing is I can
do this. You've also got everyone around

[36:15]
do this. You've also got everyone around
you who thinks you've lost your mind.
Your family are like when you get a real
job. Most of us have graduated uni or
something then we go throw that away. So
you feel it. You feel the external
pressure from people around you. even if
it's not like every day or month to
month. You feel that people don't really

[36:30]
month. You feel that people don't really
know what I'm doing and I need to
validate that. So yeah, I feel like it's
it definitely puts a lot of performance
pressure on you. Some families are
environments will be more kind of toxic
in terms of the pressure they they feel.
Me personally, I just felt like I had to
prove to myself I could make it work.

[36:45]
prove to myself I could make it work.
And then I had to show over time to my
peer group in my family that I wasn't
losing my mind and I could hey look,
I've got this. Don't don't worry about
me. I'm I'm on the I'm on the right
path. So yeah, I feel like in terms of
performance, it has a big impact because
if you're trying to perform, but you're
worried about making money to pay the

[37:01]
worried about making money to pay the
bills, it's just a lot of pressure. It
makes you very attached to results. It
makes swings feel very personal and oh
my god, what I'm losing. Even if you
think you can handle the swings, if you
feel like your family can't deal with
it, you're just going to have to keep
that secret from them. Keep that secret
from the people around you. I know many

[37:16]
from the people around you. I know many
poker players who don't tell their
partners what they're winning and losing
because their partners can't deal with
the them losing and winning lots of
money. So yeah, I feel like there's a
lot that goes into it. Hopefully most
players get the point over time where
they can create a bit of stability. They

[37:30]
they can create a bit of stability. They
can potentially show people around them
over time that they're committed.
They're dedicated to it. I felt like for
me personally, the biggest thing wasn't
showing results. It was showing attitude
and dedication to what I did. And I
tried to show some results. I tried to
show graphs, tried to show my super late
breakback, which was guaranteed. None of

[37:46]
breakback, which was guaranteed. None of
that really worked. But over time,
they're like, "Oh, Adam, you seem like
you're really committed to this poker
thing. Feels like you've got it
covered." over time obviously this is a
four to five year thing to get respect
there but yeah I feel like also over
time you generally realize it doesn't
really matter your parents will not
understand your peer groups some of them

[38:01]
understand your peer groups some of them
will kind of get poked but not really
and then doing it for your own reasons
like kind of graduating through that
kind of trying to prove to other people
then hopefully get to a point where you
feel comfortable in yourself and then
everyone else gets with their own life
their own problems and they leave you to
it especially for you Benny I'm sure

[38:15]
it especially for you Benny I'm sure
you've been playing poker long enough
you get left alone now and there's no no
external pressures there See, I would
love to jump into a bit of more of a
modern day part of your story in terms
of 2024. I know you went on a big
downswing and it was a challenging
experience in terms of losing a big part
of your role. I want to know how you

[38:31]
of your role. I want to know how you
generally deal with down swings
obviously as a poker player especially
playing tournaments. One of the
challenges dealing with variance. Uh so
you personally how how have you dealt
with that in 2024 in particular? How do
you deal with that period for yourself?

[38:46]
you deal with that period for yourself?
Yeah. So, I think in the past there's
probably
been two different ways that I've
approached
it. And sometimes it's been more
effective than others, but that's

[39:00]
effective than others, but that's
probably larger results orientated. I
think the two mindsets I had was like I
want to just like grind through it. I
just want to kind of keep going and try
and
um either build confidence back up or

[39:16]
um either build confidence back up or
you know build some money up in a way uh
and you know still feel like I'm on the
right track. The other was just take
time off
um obviously like quite opposing uh

[39:31]
um obviously like quite opposing uh
paths. So I think it depends
how and depends when as well. So I
think like at that

[39:45]
think like at that
time I probably could have used some
time off frankly. I think that might
have been a better
uh path for me at that time.
But live stops are a thing like that

[40:02]
But live stops are a thing like that
schedule still happens.
So then for example there was the Irish
Open at that time and that was kind of
near the end of my downswing

[40:16]
near the end of my downswing
where if it was later on I would have
preferred that. I would have gone then
instead I would have just maybe taken
time off but like felt the kind of
obligation and ne necessity to go there
even though I wasn't necessarily in the

[40:31]
even though I wasn't necessarily in the
the greatest headsp space probably
um but I had thought you know good
tournaments there friends there that as
well so that was also kind of an
important thing for me sort of having

[40:45]
important thing for me sort of having
the hopeful social fun aspect of it that
would hopefully kind of put me in a
better headsp space.
Um, unfortunately it didn't work out
that time but again that's sort of
resultant in a sample of like 10 15

[41:01]
resultant in a sample of like 10 15
tournaments it's like quite meaningless.
Um,
but I
think if I would have had the space to
take time off then it probably would
have been better for me. Um, so the main

[41:19]
have been better for me. Um, so the main
way I would look
to deal with down swings is just
have better other better things going on
in my life really as well. I think
that's very important for me personally.

[41:31]
that's very important for me personally.
I think when there are other
uh skills or other like aspects that are
going well for me that I can look at and
sort of be happy with. I think that's an
important thing for me and not have

[41:46]
important thing for me and not have
poker be the main focus cuz if you know
poker is sort of your whole life and
that's not going well, it can feel
really really tough and very kind
of absorbing um in a in a in a tough

[42:02]
of absorbing um in a in a in a tough
way. So I look to try to have more
balance in those times. be like, "Oh, my
health is okay if I'm like back in the
gym at that time." If you're, you know,
let's say, hitting a PB or something.

[42:15]
let's say, hitting a PB or something.
So, other ways that you might be able to
get some feeling of satisfaction and
achievement that sometimes poker grants
you um other things there or, you know,
like, oh, I'm enjoying playing guitar.
I'm good at that. whatever it is, you

[42:30]
I'm good at that. whatever it is, you
can have other aspects as well as uh
social environments just to both have
fun and maybe take your mind off poker
as well. And then also the other way is
just probably study as well. Trying to

[42:46]
just probably study as well. Trying to
get kind of confidence back through that
way as well where you're kind
of both trying to fix your weaknesses
and being like, okay, I'm getting these
things right. I am still on the right

[43:00]
things right. I am still on the right
track. Getting kind of the confirmation
to get your confidence back up and sort
of like, yeah, okay, I'm I'm doing these
things right and having the knowledge
and confidence that, you know, in the
long term you're going to be winning.
It's going to, you know, happen for you

[43:16]
It's going to, you know, happen for you
in good ways hopefully. So, I think all
of those are different aspects that I
would to go. Yeah, I think you covered
all the potential paths you can take to
deal with downswing. The first was like
playing through it like volume your way
through it almost overcome variance by

[43:30]
through it almost overcome variance by
playing as you mentioned occasional live
stops that's the the only play because
there's no times to breaks then you
mentioned like the kind of taking breaks
from the game overall and getting your
life in order at least like feeling that
you're not just a poker player I know
for me the worst down swings were my
early days living in Thailand with

[43:45]
early days living in Thailand with
friends and all I did was play poker
study live breathe it in a down swing
felt like my heart had been ripped out
and it was so painful because nothing
else was going on in my life to kind of
balance it so yeah I I think having
other things going on allows you to
realize ah poker is going bad but this
is going well and I think the other

[44:01]
is going well and I think the other
avenue is regaining confidence through
studying that would always be my default
to try to gain confidence by studying
more at least increasing the ratio you
know kind of playing to study ratio
during down swings it's often very hard
to keep that confidence high when
results are slapping you in the face so

[44:15]
results are slapping you in the face so
yeah I think it's a it's good to know
like what works for you and you
mentioned for you time off works well
it's taking a break or the players might
be going harder in the lab trying to
find that balance there's no like right
or wrong no sweet spot for that works
for everyone, but trying to find that
optimal balance. I feel like probably
the worst is when you play through in a

[44:31]
the worst is when you play through in a
bad mindset and hope results will turn
around. I know I've many players who
this is their go-to and it's like I keep
playing, keep playing. It's like yeah,
you're playing dog [ __ ] and you keep
losing and it's not going to turn
around. You need to take a bit of time
off. So yeah, I feel there's a other
ones taking a bit of a break at least by

[44:45]
ones taking a bit of a break at least by
default. you can reevaluate, you can
clear your heads, you can improve your
game. Whereas just a blindly going
through, which I'm a stubborn guy, so I
can relate to the mindset, but you
better watch the warning signs when when
you take that too far. Yeah, absolutely.
Yeah. I I think the problem there as
well is that people then see like, okay,
I'm in a down swing. They put it in the

[45:01]
I'm in a down swing. They put it in the
variance calculator, right? They put
their win rate that they've observed.
They say, "Okay, I I have to grind this
out, so I have to just play 200k hands
and then I'll be out of it." Not
realizing that their current win rate is
no longer their actual win rate. So the
down swing will only last more. And it's
it's really uh usually when you ask him

[45:17]
it's really uh usually when you ask him
like what are you trying to do while I'm
trying to get out of it? Okay. So you
think now playing more in a compromised
state is going to get you out of it.
Usually the intention is good but
there's a flaw right that you have to
kind of correct. Yeah. I I was actually
going to say the same thing. I remember
during that time when I I felt like

[45:31]
during that time when I I felt like
obligated to play and I didn't
particularly want to actively be playing
because of the kind of that that mindset
that I think I I wasn't playing my a
game. I think it was likely that you
know my ROI was lower in general.

[45:47]
know my ROI was lower in general.
So what both variance is higher
essentially when your ROI is lower and
you're battling there but also just that
the win rate was lower and I wasn't
playing as well. It's going to have

[46:00]
playing as well. It's going to have
worse results than otherwise. And I
think I noticed that at that time I
think that was quite a serious thing
that I was like okay going to take a
pause. Okay. You've played a ridiculous
amount of scoops and W Coups. I think
2023 was your best year when you had a
record of seven wins. What makes you

[46:18]
record of seven wins. What makes you
suited to uh the kind of series grind?
And we'll go into for you personally how
you approach these and yeah, what
personally for you what you find was a
suit good fit for you? Yeah.
Uh funny funnily enough, I don't think I

[46:33]
Uh funny funnily enough, I don't think I
am necessarily super suited for a
serious grind. actually was the main
thing I was thinking about when you
asked that.
Um, so yeah, that W Coop and Scoop year,

[46:45]
Um, so yeah, that W Coop and Scoop year,
I
was playing in Vancouver and it's
generally on a very early schedule for
in Vancouver and it's earlier than I'd
like. Like I'm I'm not sort of a morning
person. I'm not like strict doing that.

[47:00]
person. I'm not like strict doing that.
So frankly, I I'm not such a series
grinder in that way. Like I really kind
of have to force myself and it's
difficult for me. And I think I don't

[47:15]
necessarily play the best that I can
like consistently in that environment
when it's sort of more forced and like
try
to be waking up like as early as I need
to in that time like cuz it's like a

[47:32]
to in that time like cuz it's like a
8:39 a.m. starts
essentially which for me is too early. I
would like to be able to take my time in
the morning, kind of wake my brain up
and that kind of stuff before I start a

[47:45]
and that kind of stuff before I start a
big grind.
Um,
and honestly, it feels quite limiting to
me in those environments as well. Uh,
I do it in Vancouver generally because I

[48:01]
I do it in Vancouver generally because I
like the aspect of being able to go
outside after a series, go see sunlight.
it's still light outside and I can
actually make use of that time being
outside and I can decompress after a
series uh after a day of the series and

[48:19]
series uh after a day of the series and
you know still do some activity
hopefully exercise something like that
but I still find it quite difficult to
be honest like each series day is pretty

[48:31]
be honest like each series day is pretty
intense there's a lot going on don't get
more than a 4m minute break throughout
the day for like 8 plus hours.
And in a way, I would like to have a
better answer for you and just be like,

[48:45]
better answer for you and just be like,
"Yeah, I I crush it and you know, this
is so easy for me. I do it in this this
this way." But honestly, that's it's
just a really hard thing like
objectively to just be 8 plus hours a
day multitabling everything with like no
longer than 4 minutes break. And like

[49:02]
longer than 4 minutes break. And like
after a day of that, it's like tough for
me to kind of let go of those days in a
way. You know, it'll normally take me a
good, let's say, couple of hours after

[49:15]
good, let's say, couple of hours after
the day of grinding finishes before I'm
kind of in a nicer, calmer headspace.
And I would say I'm good at, you know,
multitabling generally, but
uh well, in some ways, I'm sure I could

[49:33]
uh well, in some ways, I'm sure I could
be better organized in certain things,
like let's say getting my meal prep
sorted, like all of these kind of things
where I could make the most of my
breaks. But,
um, that's still, uh, something that I

[49:47]
um, that's still, uh, something that I
have room to improve on as well.
And
uh I mean obviously with playing
multiple games and playing everything I
think I have the ability

[50:02]
think I have the ability
to do well in kind of winning lots of
things, lots of tournaments, but at the
same time uh it probably takes some ROI
out of my game in certain aspects which

[50:17]
out of my game in certain aspects which
is
also not a great thing when I'm
playing eight nine tables of all
different games including like a $11 bed
2208 at the same time as a as a tough 2k

[50:31]
2208 at the same time as a as a tough 2k
no limit 1k no limit like definitely my
ROI is lower in the 1k no limit it's
where edge is already really tough in
those really small in those these days
they're very tough honestly 1k plus

[50:46]
they're very tough honestly 1k plus
cubes are very tough So, if I'm playing
all these other games and all these
other tables where all my focus is, then
realistically, I think my ROI is, you
know, down to maybe break even.

[51:02]
And I think I'd do a good job of
managing those overall, but
realistically, it's still tough. And in
terms of actually
dollar value, that's potentially

[51:18]
dollar value, that's potentially
not the best thing. So in a way, I maybe
do a good job of not having the dollar
value best for each game, but like the
overall wins as well is uh higher if I'm

[51:33]
overall wins as well is uh higher if I'm
going for overall like leaderboard
points or something like that.
So yeah, it sounds like these series are
a mental challenge, like a very grueling
affair, but it also feels like you have

[51:47]
affair, but it also feels like you have
an ability to manage these better than
most people. Let's just put it that way.
Because even though you're you're
struggling, other players must be
struggling twice as much. Yeah, I'm
curious to know for you when you're
playing lots of different formats at the
same time. I'm just trying to relate to

[52:00]
same time. I'm just trying to relate to
that experience. It must be very
challenging with different strategies
for different game types, different
buyins. How do you uh maybe simplify
your decision- making to allow yourself
to to play so many different formats
simultaneously?

[52:15]
Yeah, as as you said, it is a
simplification
where spots where there definitely is
going to be
um exploits available or certain things

[52:30]
um exploits available or certain things
that
are going to be higher EV decisions. if
I was like really locked in on one or
two tables. But realistically, if I'm a
tableabling, you can't really do that
unfortunately.

[52:46]
unfortunately.
So, I'd probably simplify just by
playing a kind of a more basic
theoretical strategy, sort of in a more
autopiloting way there, which as I said,
likely reduces my ROI there. So, I I I

[53:01]
likely reduces my ROI there. So, I I I
don't think it's a good thing really.
Yeah, but it must be a effective
baseline strategy as you mentioned. It's
like to optimize EV in this environment
feels it's not going to work. So you've

[53:15]
feels it's not going to work. So you've
got to find a workaround to go right, I
need to make decisions for eight hours
in different formats. I need to find a
way for my brain to actually do that. So
yeah, obviously it's probably
frustrating for you as a competitive guy
to uh to play below the standard you
could play on a low amount of tables,
but does feel like also survival of the

[53:31]
but does feel like also survival of the
fittest and trying to to cover the
strategy for that. Yeah. And I do try to
like really prioritize the series like
during that series. I'm like this is the
thing I'm focusing on for these three
and a half weeks. The rest of my life is

[53:45]
and a half weeks. The rest of my life is
essentially going to go on the the back
burner. So like this is going to be my
focus which you know I'm still doing
other things cuz that's part of the
series for me is important to have the
balance. It is helpful for me to have
the ability to go see friends after a

[54:01]
the ability to go see friends after a
day of grinding. Go, you know, do the
outside sport, whatever it is,
decompress in the gym, something like
that. I see that as in a way kind of
part of the grind or even like
a morning preparation or something like

[54:16]
a morning preparation or something like
it's cater to grinding is pretty much
going to be my focus for that time. But
I don't necessarily think
it's a great thing for like let's say
happiness EV during that time. You know,

[54:30]
happiness EV during that time. You know,
it's it's a really tough gruding thing
and yeah, like that is the focus going
to try to get back to other life after.
Yeah. You're making a big sacrifice, a

[54:45]
Yeah. You're making a big sacrifice, a
lot of trade-offs to optimize for poker
during that. And if it doesn't help with
the grind, it probably gets put on the
back burner. If it feels like it
complements it, it sounds like for you
personally, you would you would keep it
in there. So, imagine someone listening
who is getting ready to play a scooped
grind and yeah, they want to optimize

[55:02]
grind and yeah, they want to optimize
their performance during it. What would
be your top three tips to increase their
results or just survive a series like
that? Okay.
Um I guess first thing would be the
assumption

[55:16]
assumption
that they won't move time zone I guess
for that. So let's say assuming that
they're going to play it from wherever
they normally play online. So,
uh, for me again, my main consideration,

[55:31]
uh, for me again, my main consideration,
like this series, for example, I
basically just decided I was going back
to Vancouver, even though it's on too
early of a time zone for me. Um, I would
prefer somewhere a bit more east of
there. So, I was debating that.

[55:47]
there. So, I was debating that.
Um,
I go there also just because I like the
whole
uh environment basically kind of the the
atmosphere and I sort of curate it in a

[56:02]
atmosphere and I sort of curate it in a
way of like I'm planning to be focusing
on this series during that time but also
I'm like okay I know the things that I'm
going to do in the evenings roughly. I
could go to this gym. I can go to

[56:16]
could go to this gym. I can go to
whatever class, the yoga class,
something like this. That's going to be
nice for me in the evening. So, I
think one thing is just have the that
environment clearly

[56:31]
environment clearly
uh set up in a way, assuming that
they're going to play it from their
house. That's kind of what I was
thinking about. You probably know things
that are around your house um that you
can
do, but think about how it might

[56:46]
do, but think about how it might
complement the grind or not and
how you best operate for those kind of
things
like before and after the grind. Is it
nice for you

[57:00]
nice for you
to, you know, work out beforehand, after
it? How do you decompress after the
grind before sleep? So your schedules
for this is very important obviously
like sleep schedules is of course a big
thing.

[57:15]
thing.
So it's hard to give like clear advice
on that for if someone is living in X
place and they have this certain
schedules. Uh but thinking about all
those things the way you can optimize
that would probably be the the main
thing.

[57:31]
thing.
Um, other ways I guess
uh it sort of depends, you know, if
you're a full-time player or or
part-time how or you know, recreational
if you're looking at these. So, you can

[57:46]
if you're looking at these. So, you can
maybe plan how your series is going to
look. You can look at the schedule,
think what the events that I want to
play. Are there events that I'm going to
prioritize? How much am I going to play
each day? Am I going to take any days

[58:00]
each day? Am I going to take any days
off? Things like
that. Um, so just to sort of plan and
envision how your weeks are going to
go. Then things like trying to make the
most of the 5 minute breaks. Try and

[58:18]
most of the 5 minute breaks. Try and
get, you know, meals sorted if you can
is a huge thing. How else are you going
to use them? Maybe are you going to have
little 4minute meditations packed in

[58:30]
little 4minute meditations packed in
something like this? Something that
you're going to be able
to
hopefully set you up better for each
next hour after this that 5 minute break
basically.
So these are I think quite important

[58:45]
So these are I think quite important
that hopefully each person knows how
they work best in those environments so
they can think oh those four hands I'm
going to sorry those four minutes I'm
going to run hands that I had from that

[59:01]
going to run hands that I had from that
last
hour and
then they will not be on my mind for the
rest of the day. something like this. If
it's hard for you to kind of let go of
the last hour, that might help. Or if

[59:15]
the last hour, that might help. Or if
you just want to take your mind off
cocoa, go see the sunlight for 4
minutes, and then set yourself up for
the next hour. That's, you know,
perfectly great. So, obviously, it works
differently for each person.
Um, then there's like, are you going to

[59:31]
Um, then there's like, are you going to
study before the series? Are you going
to prepare how you're going to
work for the series? Again, can be for
each person. Some people might just want
to take their brain off poker for the

[59:47]
to take their brain off poker for the
series because that's what they're going
to do for those 3 and 1/2 weeks and
focus only on the playing. Others might
like to study and then feel like really
ready to go cuz they're feeling like
really switched on. So in that way of

[1:00:01]
really switched on. So in that way of
anticipating how you're going to be for
this series as well, I think is very
important in terms of both ability and
confidence and execution in all these
things because you're going to need to
be executing when you're on day seven

[1:00:18]
be executing when you're on day seven
and hour seven of the day and you're
going to be tired and trying to not
autopilot and what everything. So you
have to kind of be prepared

[1:00:31]
have to kind of be prepared
to be prepared to struggle in a way like
be prepared to be tired and having a
tough time. So if you have the study to
back it up then you will do better at

[1:00:45]
back it up then you will do better at
executing in those tough times. Right?
It's important and hopefully as well
also in the tough times where it's like
late in the day and
you're s you're playing for more money

[1:01:01]
you're s you're playing for more money
the final tables like these kind of
things where it's more important
obviously to be playing well hopefully
that you will still then you will still
be executing well. Um, if
there's some kind of ways that help

[1:01:16]
there's some kind of ways that help
you relax for, let's say, a final table
where you're able to feel confident,
then that's very important. Like knowing
where all the money is up top on final
tables, this is going to probably define

[1:01:31]
tables, this is going to probably define
your series in a lot of
cases. Um, yeah. So, those are the main
things as well as even like the
preparations before each day that you
might want to do. Are you going to want
to sleep until this time? Are you want

[1:01:45]
to sleep until this time? Are you want
to go Are you going to want to go
outside and see some fresh air, see some
friends, get exercise? Are you going to
want to prepare, meditate before a
session?
So, just focus on how you think you will

[1:02:00]
So, just focus on how you think you will
do best. It's a bit hard for me to say
because people are so different in those
aspects. So hopefully you know how you
optimally work in those kind of
environments. So yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, that was a master
class in what to consider to prepare

[1:02:17]
class in what to consider to prepare
yourself for a series. And what was
evident there is how much planning,
preparation, intentionality goes into
everything from environment to routine
to your evening wind down to when to
take breaks, what to do on your breaks,

[1:02:30]
take breaks, what to do on your breaks,
when to eat, what to eat, what schedule
I'm grinding, do I need days off, do I
need to grind before, study before or
not? So, as you mentioned, very
personal, but I think the questions you
went through and the kind of the main
things you put forward there, each
player needs to address them for
themselves and go, "Right, for me, how
do I make sure everything is set up for

[1:02:46]
do I make sure everything is set up for
me and my environments to make sure I
perform the best?" One thing I wanted to
ask for you is how do you approach days
off? I know there's like kind of mixed
views on these. And I hear players, some
just want to grind almost every day.
Some have the philosophy of I'll take a
set day off when the schedule's not as

[1:03:01]
set day off when the schedule's not as
busy and others have like I'll take a
day off as I need it kind of approach.
So for you personally you've done many
series. What is your approach to off
days?
Yeah. So thankfully for scoop and woop
they have the dedicated day off on

[1:03:15]
they have the dedicated day off on
Friday. I absolutely always take that
day off. I think it would be borderline
insanity not to really like I I can't be
grinding it literally every day, you
know? I need that kind of reset. You
know, if there was two days off a week,
I would probably be happy.

[1:03:32]
I would probably be happy.
Um, and then the question is how I take
that day off. And honestly, I mostly try
to listen to my body and how I'm
feeling.

[1:03:45]
feeling.
So, I would often have ideas of how I
would take that day off. like, okay, if
I'm feeling up for going to the gym,
great. If I'm not, okay, I'll give
myself a rest day. I'll allow myself to

[1:04:01]
myself a rest day. I'll allow myself to
kind of be tired if I want to. So if I'm
feeling like that, then I think it's
probably more important and valuable for
me
to actually like take care of myself and

[1:04:16]
to actually like take care of myself and
how I'm feeling
and allowing myself the space to kind of
be however I'm feeling. Like am I
wanting to have energy to go outdoors?

[1:04:31]
wanting to have energy to go outdoors?
Great. Um, even if I want to like study
for an hour and run hands that I've had
from the series so far, that's great. If
I'm not, then okay, I'll just give
myself a break. Um, normally I am

[1:04:45]
myself a break. Um, normally I am
generally like trying to see friends
that I normally haven't seen the rest of
the series so much. Same with like
trying to see some nature I think is a
really nice reset for me in general. I
think that's quite important for my

[1:05:01]
think that's quite important for my
headsp space and kind of peace of mind
where you are mostly kind of locked in
doors for a whole series. I think it's
nice to go outside even like go for a

[1:05:15]
nice to go outside even like go for a
hike in Vancouver if I have the energy
something like that to then kind of
reset my brain to like okay next day
we're locked in for another week. We're
going to have to be put through this
thing.
So whatever I think

[1:05:30]
So whatever I think
is going to set my mind and body best
for the following weeks is best. As well
as how I think I will have kind of
gotten over the past week of insanity
best. Like is it going to be study best?

[1:05:47]
best. Like is it going to be study best?
Is it going to be just do nothing? Uh
best. Uh oh. Sometimes I do something
like a float tank even where I just
literally turn your brain off for an
hour. Like something like that I think

[1:06:01]
hour. Like something like that I think
is quite nice as a relaxing way.
Yeah. So it sounds like you spend that
day really checking in with yourself and
figuring out what what do you need most
now for recovery to set yourself up for

[1:06:15]
now for recovery to set yourself up for
those next six days. So, it feels like
you've got a lot of different tools you
can use based on how you're feeling,
whether it's going to study, get
outdoors, or even flow. But, yeah, I
really like that that flexibility. I
think it takes a bit of self-awareness
to uh understand yourself well enough to
go, what do I need right now? Not push

[1:06:30]
go, what do I need right now? Not push
yourself too hard. Just really trying to
check in, listen to the body, and figure
out what's going to be uh that optimal
balance for recovery. So, I just want to
touch on one thing you mentioned
earlier, how late in sessions, final
tables, for example, that's often where
all the money's made. Yet, often that's
where focus is the most strained. you've

[1:06:46]
where focus is the most strained. you've
been playing long sessions, multiple
days in a row. And it's great if we just
go, "Right, focus. Let's turn it up to a
10. Let's go final table." But a lot of
players will be feeling fatigued. They
might struggle with the the long grinder
sessions. For you, how do you make sure
that what do you do personally to make

[1:07:00]
that what do you do personally to make
sure your focus is where you want it to
be for final tables late in the grinds?
Mhm. Um,
and it it touches a bit in with this.
Um, I was also going to add for the last
point as well that I think age is

[1:07:16]
point as well that I think age is
actually a factor too where I think I've
changed a bit um the older I've got.
Like sadly, I don't think I can just go
quite as hard as I I could 10 years ago
with like literally just just playing
every day. I think I do need to be

[1:07:32]
every day. I think I do need to be
listening to my body more these days and
knowing
how I work better to just not like kind
of burn myself out into the ground.
Uh sadly it's just having to accept that

[1:07:47]
Uh sadly it's just having to accept that
situation where age is a thing and
uh I don't have the energy in that way
that I used to with just being able to
have the ability to go 8 plus hours

[1:08:01]
have the ability to go 8 plus hours
every day and still like have the energy
to just like bang the next day.
Um and yeah, in terms of energy for like
the final
tables in a way,

[1:08:16]
tables in a way,
um is partly why I seek that kind of
time zone as well where I'm kind of
fortunate where if I'm playing a final
table and it's 4 or 5:00 p.m. for me

[1:08:30]
table and it's 4 or 5:00 p.m. for me
rather than like 1 or 2 a.m. uh in
Europe for example. So I think that's
important and it's where like hopefully
I still have some energy left in that

[1:08:46]
I still have some energy left in that
uh time of the grind uh because of where
it lies in my day.
Um in general honestly a main thing is

[1:09:00]
Um in general honestly a main thing is
just practice. It's sort of hard in a
way to kind of teach it, I think. Um I'm
I'm curious if you'll agree there
actually, but I think just experience is

[1:09:16]
actually, but I think just experience is
very
important
where you know if you've been there
before, it is just easier in a lot of
ways. you understand things that going
to be happening both with like a table
dynamic and strategy and will be

[1:09:31]
dynamic and strategy and will be
happening to how you will be feeling as
well.
Um so in in that way I'm sort of curious
if you think you're able to kind of
teach people that to if they are there

[1:09:45]
teach people that to if they are there
for the first time.
Yes. I think as you mentioned experience
plays a massive role both from in terms
of strategy being able to uh feel
confident in your strategy and also
getting the reps in like the reps of
long sessions focus like a muscle if

[1:10:01]
long sessions focus like a muscle if
you're focusing for long periods often
you get laid fatigued focally fatigued
you're still able to perform at a high
level in terms of teachability I think
let's say someone struggles with this
they haven't got the reps in they're
slightly inexperienced and they get to a
final table I think for them it's

[1:10:16]
final table I think for them it's
understanding how to regain focus so
rather than like expecting to be in an
optim optimal state the whole session.
They need to spot when their mind's
wondered. Give their mind anchor points
and really almost like put extra effort
in to stay in focus. Also understanding
their kind of arousal or activation.

[1:10:30]
their kind of arousal or activation.
Some players you can put them in a final
table environments and they kind of
switch on things are like ready to go.
Other players almost get overwhelmed
like things too much happen almost like
jittery because the pressure gets them
especially if they're quite
inexperienced. So you got to understand
your own temperaments what's going on

[1:10:45]
your own temperaments what's going on
internally and how to channel that into
performance. So obviously with
experience these things become quite
standardized almost like non-verbal say
oh yeah put me in a high environment I
can just put the reps in like your body
just takes over so to speak but when
you're more inexperienced you need to uh
yes be more mindful of what your

[1:11:00]
yes be more mindful of what your
tendencies are and how to redirect your
focus and calm yourself down if you need
to when you're going into it. But yeah I
think experience is uh in anything if we
look at how we learn we can get
information but real understanding can
only come from experience. So to
actually be able to perform under
pressure, you have to get reps in,

[1:11:15]
pressure, you have to get reps in,
perform under pressure consistently to
actually to master that. So yeah, I
think there's there's no shortcut.
There's there's things you can work on
to to bridge that gap. I think agree.
Yeah. I I was thinking about it cuz I
didn't feel like it's necessarily the
best advice to someone, especially if
they're a newcomer player to final

[1:11:33]
they're a newcomer player to final
tables is make more final tables. That's
how you get better at final tables. You
know, it's not necessarily the greatest
advice. Um, but I I was also thinking
then
about certain things that potentially

[1:11:45]
about certain things that potentially
help me over the years that I've
noticed. So overwhelm is like an
important thing for sure as well
where both like expectations in my mind

[1:12:00]
where both like expectations in my mind
can actually kind of hinder my
performance just because
of overwhelm and how I'm picturing
something.
And final tables are obviously
incredibly dynamic things. They can, you
know, change the whole dynamic in one

[1:12:15]
know, change the whole dynamic in one
hand. You can be chip leader and go to
seven of eight left. You have to be able
to just kind of recalibrate immediately
without resting
on the the change, you know, the the

[1:12:32]
on the the change, you know, the the
disappointment, how that's gone. You
have to be able to kind of maneuver each
change as best you can and recalibrate
and now move forward with how it's best
to maneuver from that point of view. And

[1:12:47]
to maneuver from that point of view. And
also the overwhelm in a way of even like
certain things that I used to do that I
think made it something tougher for me.
Like I would maybe post on social media

[1:13:00]
Like I would maybe post on social media
that I made a final table because you
know I want to be like this is you know
cool thing like support is nice this
kind of thing. But I realized that even
things surrounding that probably adds
things to me and to my brain that it

[1:13:16]
things to me and to my brain that it
probably hinders me in a way. Um
especially like I might get messages
coming in about it and it's like a
distraction just more extra things on my
brain
that sort of take me out of the moment

[1:13:32]
that sort of take me out of the moment
and it's difficult for me to probably
focus and just focus on my strategy as
much as I can when there's these kind of
things. So I started doing that less and
I think that's helpful. So, it's kind of

[1:13:47]
I think that's helpful. So, it's kind of
limiting external things like that that
might take focus away from you and might
lead to overwhelm and might just be a
detriment to your game. So, finding ways

[1:14:00]
detriment to your game. So, finding ways
that you're going to be most
comfortable, most relaxed and focused
there. Yeah. Best.
For you, was most of that overwhelm
feeling coming from external pressures,
external inputs, so to speak, in terms
of noise outside the system or was there

[1:14:16]
of noise outside the system or was there
also an internal overwhelm? Because
sometimes we can create our own
narrative, our own pressure. We can get
overwhelmed because we're overthinking
about the payoff structure. This guy's
really good and it can be completely
internal state. So for you, how would
you describe that? Absolutely. Yeah,

[1:14:31]
you describe that? Absolutely. Yeah,
it's a it's a good question and it's
something I've definitely thought about
a lot in the past.
Um, it's both. I think for me in
general,
um, I
think often my own expectations of

[1:14:46]
think often my own expectations of
things
might make things worse for me,
especially if it doesn't go to plan. So
if it's uh well I was going to say loss
but it's like I've come second or third

[1:15:01]
but it's like I've come second or third
in a tournament but I I still might be
very disappointed in the
scenario you know let's say
as first with half the chips
remaining with four left or whatever and

[1:15:15]
remaining with four left or whatever and
then you you kind of build up that
expectation in your mind.
um that is unhelpful to me in the past.
Like I've realized that as well as like
I would even build a possible
expectation or just have something in my

[1:15:31]
expectation or just have something in my
mind of
like imagining when
I'm posting it to the world and I'm
getting all the like praise and support
and all that kind of things that I'm
envisioning to be so nice and like I'm

[1:15:46]
envisioning to be so nice and like I'm
hoping to be the case of whatever like
winning another title and how nice
that's going to be. Like having that in
my mind I know I used to have and
probably that expectation

[1:16:01]
probably that expectation
makes things more costly for me when it
doesn't go to plan and can probably also
just just take some focus away from it
too when I'm just have that narrative.

[1:16:15]
too when I'm just have that narrative.
Um, as you said, like the word narrative
there, I think is quite spot on for me
when I just think about things related
to that. As well as like narratives,
when I'm thinking
like, oh, this replay is going to be

[1:16:30]
like, oh, this replay is going to be
broadcast, what are people going to
think when they see a play with cards
up? And that is like a narrative I still
have, unfortunately, that I think is
probably unhelpful to me in general.

[1:16:46]
probably unhelpful to me in general.
Um, so narratives like those I I kind of
try to get rid of just the sort of extra
voices and noise from
uh in a way it's myself, but it's like
I'm putting it I'm putting it onto other

[1:17:01]
I'm putting it I'm putting it onto other
people in a way like I'm I'm putting
other people's potential thoughts on
them that's happening in my head. So
just like those kind of imaginations
that I've had in the past uh yeah I

[1:17:17]
that I've had in the past uh yeah I
think hindering me and as well as like
myself when
it's
more if it doesn't go to plan. It's more
than just like the you haven't won the

[1:17:32]
than just like the you haven't won the
tournaments. It's not more than it's not
just like you've come second in a
tournament. It's like it's a loss of all
these other things essentially that I
have envisioned and expected

[1:17:45]
have envisioned and expected
and that is both worse afterwards and I
think during play as well for me. So
I've
learned
to get better at that. I think I
probably still have a bit of a way to

[1:18:00]
probably still have a bit of a way to
go. Um, but I think thinking about all
these
things even like beforehand and trying
to be at peace with them more is going
to have you being more at peace during
the game essentially and not have those

[1:18:16]
the game essentially and not have those
extra narratives and voices in your head
affecting your strategy. So if you
really think very deeply actually with
what you
think you are seeking in that way.

[1:18:32]
think you are seeking in that way.
So if you envision, oh, I'll get these
whatever nice feelings from when my
friend congratulates me on the win.

[1:18:45]
uh
to how can I put
it? Try to have those feelings first
either way
and not think of those as being
contingent on a
tournament. then it's going to be a lot

[1:19:03]
tournament. then it's going to be a lot
more peaceful experience for you so that
you're not then seeking it's not that
when you're playing and it's not a
potential loss of that then you're more
comfortable.

[1:19:15]
True. I hope that made sense. Yeah, I'm
glad you shared that and went into so
much depth there. And as you were
speaking there, I was almost saying like
the expectations being your inner
pressure that you're building on
yourself and expectations as a
tournament player is always tricky
because you guys play long grinds, you

[1:19:31]
because you guys play long grinds, you
get to final table, the payout structure
starts going up and up and up and it's
hard not to create a story around that.
And if you're not careful, expectations
start rising and rising. And the
expectations always the story narrative
that is setting you up for a fall
because if you match that, you win. It's
like, yeah, I got the high that I

[1:19:45]
like, yeah, I got the high that I
wanted, but anything below that feels
like a loss. So, you're creating this
kind of almost like moment where you're
going to drop from it most of the time.
Obviously, if you win, your expectations
gets satisfied, but most times you're
realizing your well, you're not
realizing, but you are setting yourself
up for a a fall. It's going to feel like

[1:20:00]
up for a a fall. It's going to feel like
a loss even though you might not you
might get a big score. So, I think that
is just watching it. As you mentioned,
try to be very careful not to get too
attached to the result part of it, not
get too excited. It's almost like I
could win, that would feel amazing,
could come last, it could also be good.
So it's it's trying to balance it in
real time because as soon as you get so

[1:20:16]
real time because as soon as you get so
excited there will be a comedown. So as
soon as you allow the expectations to uh
just run as a default as a story there
will be a payoff in terms of a negative
for that. And the second one was more
the outward pressures which were like
the judgments like worrying about what

[1:20:30]
the judgments like worrying about what
other people might think. This can be a
good thing in terms of what they might
think if I win how good I am. But often
it's on the negative side. How will they
feel about me? What will they think
about my player? Especially if you've
got televised events or big ones again.
And so it's like trying to uh watch that
narrative go on your mind and bring it
back to the moment. And it's hard

[1:20:45]
back to the moment. And it's hard
because we live in a world where we want
to do well and we want other people to
think we're good and do well as well. So
we live in this kind of dual world of
trying to achieve goals and also get
respect for that. But anytime those are
becoming to dominance very quickly
pressures rise and all of a sudden the

[1:21:00]
pressures rise and all of a sudden the
inner narratives the mind's just trying
to play poker and now it's fixated on
winning this tournament, doing good,
posting their graphs, it's like okay
I've lost sight of that. So I think we
all battle this to some degree.
Obviously playing tournaments is the the
ultimate manifestation of this, but I
think just watching it is a healthy
thing. Yeah, I think I was thinking like

[1:21:17]
thing. Yeah, I think I was thinking like
it depends how in depth to get to it on
a kind of therapeutic level, but it's
it's something that like I've I've
looked into and thought about quite a
lot. But yeah, for example, as you said,
like the expectations and judgments for

[1:21:32]
like the expectations and judgments for
what other people think. So if you're
feeling very
insecure during with that kind of
judgment, if you're actually at peace
with that potential judgment, then

[1:21:47]
with that potential judgment, then
there's nothing to be afraid of in that
way. Like there's nothing that's holding
you back.
So hypothetically, if you were
to look into that for yourself and think

[1:22:01]
to look into that for yourself and think
where is my fear there? What
is the judgment? Like what is the
negatives that are going to happen? What
is that going to say about myself or
what is that going to make me think

[1:22:15]
what is that going to make me think
about myself for X person to judge this?
If you're understanding that and
accepting of that and if you can feel at
peace with that then when you're playing
that's not going to be there right

[1:22:30]
that's not going to be there right
and it can happen in the same way with
the flip side with the happiness part of
it as well but I
think that was also quite a big thing
for me is trying to be at peace more

[1:22:45]
for me is trying to be at peace more
with all those kind of various potential
negative emotions whether it's going to
be even about myself something I'm
criticizing myself like if I make a
mistake then trying to not be hard on
myself then I'm not having

[1:23:01]
myself then I'm not having
the fear of making a mistake as well cuz
then I would know oh this is going to be
a negative thing I I don't want to have
that negative emotion from that as well
and same with judgment of if someone

[1:23:17]
and same with judgment of if someone
else is going to be critical of me
making a mistake. If you're envisioning
an ex person watching a replay being
like, "What the hell is he doing? This
is so bad." That like whilst you're
playing, if you have that in your mind
going along, then that's just going to

[1:23:30]
going along, then that's just going to
hold you back. If realistically, you're
somehow able to be at peace and
accepting of people thinking you're
terrible, then it's not going to hold
you back during or after as well. you're
not going to have the like turmoil going

[1:23:46]
not going to have the like turmoil going
on of like god I played so terrible all
these other people are going to think
you know so ideally if you're able to
have peace there it's much more uh
peaceful experience
yeah I love that cuz that's super

[1:24:00]
yeah I love that cuz that's super
practical I think one way to do it is to
uh almost like envision the worst case
scenario so the worst mistake you can
make how bad it can go and how it would
make you feel and the question is can I
be okay with that can I handle that kind
of worst case and very often the initial
action is no account because it feels

[1:24:15]
action is no account because it feels
badly but very quickly you say it's just
a feeling that you don't want to
experience. So if you can if you can
experience losing making big mistakes
having people judge you in ways that you
don't particularly like for your own
security but be okay with it all of a
sudden there's nothing to worry about.

[1:24:30]
sudden there's nothing to worry about.
So yeah I think there's there's two
philosophies I like. is I don't care. So
I'm not blah blah blah what they think.
But also like when it comes to other
people, there's another frame of like
nobody cares about you personally
because they've got so much things going
on themselves. And because we have a one
player experience mode of life, we feel

[1:24:45]
player experience mode of life, we feel
like we're really important to
everybody. So we feel like everyone's
watching us. Everyone's judging us, but
they've also got their one player view
and they don't really have time to
consider you. So everyone's going
through their own lives, living their
own problems, and we're not that
important to anyone. Maybe there's three
to five people who really care about
what you're up to. Hopefully they're
good friends. Uh but generally most

[1:25:01]
good friends. Uh but generally most
people just they'll see a bit of you and
move on. So once you realize I don't
need to care too much because random
people's views don't matter and on the
flip side they don't even care. They
probably not even watching as much as I
think. Ah okay all of this a narrative
in my mind that is creating a stress or
a pressure that is actually real. It

[1:25:16]
a pressure that is actually real. It
feels real. So yeah I think it's a a lot
to uh hopefully unpack for people
listening but there's a lot you can do
to combat both of those expectations the
judgments and even make mistakes as you
mentioned there. Yeah absolutely. So
Rene for you. Good. How do you deal with

[1:25:30]
Rene for you. Good. How do you deal with
your own inner narratives? What are some
of the the more dominant ones that
you've had to overcome?
H plenty actually. Um because I I was
trying I was I was thinking when I heard
you guys talking and especially

[1:25:45]
you guys talking and especially
throughout my career and I feel like
this is like the long-term fix, right?
You have to become aware. I think that's
literally what we started this conver
this podcast with, right? Awareness. you
have to become aware of the narrative
that's running in your head and start to
observe it and start to uh change the

[1:26:01]
observe it and start to uh change the
perspective. So let's say you know that
at certain points in your session
certain narratives often come up right
and then people what people try to do is
they try to fight them in that moment
but in the moment you have no chance
you're in a compromised state you're not
going to win so I wrote down actually

[1:26:16]
going to win so I wrote down actually
something about actually this was how
you approach a series right it was very
deliberate you also have to be
deliberate with what's going to happen
in your session so what are common
feelings that come up what are common
narrative that's come up and before you
play your session you should already
think about hm how will I or what's a

[1:26:32]
think about hm how will I or what's a
better narrative that when I spot this
narrative what's kind of the override
right and then you start practicing that
or in my case I would always visualize
that before I would go into sessions
like ah this situation will come up I
will start to feel like this I will
recognize the feeling this will be the
narrative new narrative or new

[1:26:46]
narrative new narrative or new
perspective and then you practice that
every session over and over but I always
found visualization to be very powerful
because then you can practice it before
you go into the session and then when
you're in the session you're like hey
I've trained this I know this hey I
spotted this and you can plays it. And

[1:27:01]
spotted this and you can plays it. And
the same with the
expectations when you when you don't
align the expectations and something
like I think Benny said you know you're
chip leading you're already thinking
about what you're going to do with the
win and then suddenly bum you're eight
it's like what the [ __ ] just happened
and your mind cannot catch up right

[1:27:16]
and your mind cannot catch up right
whereas if you went in with listen this
can all happen right let's say for
example I'm a cash game player so an
expectation alignment that I would say
is like listen in this session honestly
anything can happen I can lose six
buyins in the first half hour so when

[1:27:30]
buyins in the first half hour so when
that would happen, I would be like,
"Huh, yeah, well, we knew that this
could happen, right?" So then you don't
freak out. Whereas if you don't align
expectation, you're like, "Wait, what?
What the [ __ ] happening? I lost six
buyins. Oh my god, can I still play
poker?" Blah blah blah blah blah. So
it's one understanding the narrative and

[1:27:45]
it's one understanding the narrative and
then the other one preventing the
narrative from happening by aligning the
expectation. Uh so yeah, I think I think
uh there was a lot to unpack here.
Anything you would like to add to that,
Benny?
Yeah, absolutely. as as you said and

[1:28:01]
Yeah, absolutely. as as you said and
it's I think also just like anticipating
your potential concerns from that
like what does each thing really mean
for you?
Like is is six buyins just losing six

[1:28:16]
Like is is six buyins just losing six
buyins? Like is that just the money or
like what is that going to mean for you?
Like you said, oh no, I can't play
poker. Like obviously it's hyperbole,
but for most people that there's like
something in that. Like there's probably
like some kind of doubt like like [ __ ]

[1:28:31]
like some kind of doubt like like [ __ ]
am I just playing terrible this session?
Like what's happening? Like it's
probably hard for some people to just
like not have that narrative at all if
uh
they're not expecting it. So, or even

[1:28:45]
they're not expecting it. So, or even
like you might expect there's a possible
worst scenario, but you just you hope it
won't happen obviously, but there's like
still some holding back there. Like
whatever it is that
uh you have as a potential narrative as

[1:29:01]
uh you have as a potential narrative as
a result to look into there like does it
mean that it's a fear of oh you actually
can't play really or is it a fear of you
know whatever is happening for you that
day. So there's like all these things

[1:29:15]
day. So there's like all these things
that can yeah be tough. So that
self-awareness as we said is is a is a
tough thing to like really dive into.
And as you said like during a session
like you're really maybe drawing dead to
like really properly get it sometimes

[1:29:31]
like really properly get it sometimes
and you might have to do it afterwards
or even like before in preparation. But
yeah, understanding yourself uh and how
you work in those ways I think is pretty
important. Yeah.
Yeah, it's like you said, right? You can

[1:29:45]
Yeah, it's like you said, right? You can
you can take that trigger and that
feeling. You can go even further down
the rabbit hole, you know, and then you
probably end up somewhere in your
childhood. I don't know what what what
you can discover there, which is great,
you know, a long term definitely work on
it, but in the short term, you know, we
also need to find a solution, right? So,

[1:30:01]
also need to find a solution, right? So,
I'm always a big fan of go see, you
know, be curious towards your own
emotions that come up like, hey, this
triggered me. Hey, I feel like this.
What does this tell me? and follow it
down the rabbit hole. But in the same
time, you know, you got a session to
play tomorrow. So, let's also try to

[1:30:16]
play tomorrow. So, let's also try to
work on, you know, uh how we how we can
actually perform tomorrow. What do you
actually do? Do you have like a sort of
uh SOS [ __ ] Nothing is, you know,
nothing works. What do I do? I have to
perform in 5 minutes. Do you have like a
to go to? Like, do you do I think you

[1:30:31]
to go to? Like, do you do I think you
mentioned already meditation? Maybe you
do some some breathing exercises.
Anything anything that you would like to
go to? Jesus. Do I have an SOS? I don't
know about that. Um
I I hope ideally I never get to that

[1:30:47]
I I hope ideally I never get to that
state. Like
I don't really know the last time I was
I was trying to think of any kind of
experience like that to to fall back on
and use. I

[1:31:02]
think yeah, you sort of hope that you're
able to manage yourself well enough
during that session that you're you're
never going to get to that state. But I
I guess if I do, then yeah, probably

[1:31:15]
I guess if I do, then yeah, probably
meditation somehow is the
way. Screaming is great if you have the
chance. just like, you know, shout into
a pillow if there's someone for for 20
seconds is beautiful. A way to get out
some tilt if you really want to um and

[1:31:33]
some tilt if you really want to um and
have that time. Why not just like just
let out some energy is honestly like
really kind of powerful and and
liberating if you want to? Is that like

[1:31:45]
liberating if you want to? Is that like
you know it sounds funny but like it can
actually be a very nice therapeutic
thing if you want to do it and you're
not bothering somebody else if you're
just doing it in your uh bedroom or
whatever. Uh but yeah, probably just

[1:32:01]
whatever. Uh but yeah, probably just
some kind of
meditation or just clearing my mind and
pausing and and doing nothing for Yeah.
that time that I'm able to.
Yeah, I would I would say a combination

[1:32:16]
Yeah, I would I would say a combination
of those two would be ideal, right? You
let it all out and post probably, you
know, all the energy and then you sit
down and like take a couple of deep
breaths and just calm down and then you
can and then you're ready to go, right?
Uh but yeah, letting it out. Actually, I

[1:32:32]
Uh but yeah, letting it out. Actually, I
changed maybe in the last half year or
year. So, I kind of changed my
philosophy around that that you know, I
was always kind of trying to okay,
control, but just having moments where
you just let anger out is actually

[1:32:46]
you just let anger out is actually
great. Like I've always in my life tried
to sort of manage it, but then at some
point they were like, "No, no, no. Anger
is okay. You can just let it out." But I
guess I was conditioned that, you know,
you shouldn't express your anger or but
then they taught me like, "No, no, in a
controlled environment, you know, you

[1:33:00]
controlled environment, you know, you
put a bunch of pillows on your on your
bed and you just start smacking,
smacking and screaming." And I did that
for like a couple minutes like, "Wow,
this actually feels amazing." Yeah, it's
great. Absolutely. I would genuinely
encourage it. It's a lot of fun. And
yeah, as you said, like there's nothing

[1:33:16]
yeah, as you said, like there's nothing
wrong with letting anger out, assuming
whatever you're hitting isn't another
person. You know, the pillows aren't
going to do anything about it and not
going to hate you for it. It's Yeah, you
look like you're about to say something.

[1:33:30]
look like you're about to say something.
But but that's the thing, right? You're
you're way you're you're way less likely
to hit another person because like
hitting another person would be a
leakage of piled up anger, right?
Whereas if you just just like any other
routine thing that you do with either
your car or your bike or whatever a

[1:33:46]
your car or your bike or whatever a
routine let it out so it doesn't
accumulate to the fact that at some
point you know you break your mouse you
break someone's nose right
absolutely I think I'm sure I've done
that before like just like gone into my

[1:34:00]
that before like just like gone into my
car and just like shouted for 20 seconds
during a break honestly it's it's great
really freeing and as you said like
conditioning is a thing. I I can relate
to what you're saying there. I
understand that from like if you think
anger is a bad thing, but normally I

[1:34:17]
anger is a bad thing, but normally I
think most people think that of like
anger at somebody else as well. So
that's why they might have like the the
conditioning issue there. But genuinely
otherwise I think to yourself or however
it's very healthy and powerful to feel

[1:34:32]
it's very healthy and powerful to feel
it, embrace it even or let it out. Yeah.
I saw uh during the conversation that uh
you're wearing an aura ring which
basically tracks metrics in your body.
Um you before that talked about you guys

[1:34:48]
Um you before that talked about you guys
talked about when you take a break. Do
you use any of the data collected on
your aura to make decisions around your
grind or do you track any other things
to help you decide, you know, what you

[1:35:00]
to help you decide, you know, what you
should be doing the rest of your day or
like for example data that you can
gather around scoops and w coops to
prepare to approach it in a better way
next time?
And when you say next time, do you mean
for like a following series from that?

[1:35:18]
for like a following series from that?
For example, are there like certain
things you track? For example, we had a
couple of guests on the podcast. One
actually literally tracked how happy he
was playing poker and then in the end he
quit poker because he realized that,
hey, when I play poker, I'm less happy
than if I play poker. So that was kind

[1:35:31]
than if I play poker. So that was kind
of the conclusion of that. Or we had,
for example, uh we had a guy who tracked
his long sessions. I think every time
when he push sessions longer than he
should and he just came to a conclusion
at some point this and my game just

[1:35:45]
at some point this and my game just
deteriorates so so many that I'm just
going to put a hard stop on 4hour
sessions for example. Well I mean these
are great
realizations.
[Music]
Um, God, I mean, honestly, I probably

[1:36:01]
Um, God, I mean, honestly, I probably
also realized that generally I'm less
happy playing poker than when I am
otherwise as well. actually sort of
going on a I guess a a tangent there,
but especially I think for like an

[1:36:17]
but especially I think for like an
online series like when I talked about
how much of a sacrifice it is, I think
it definitely I'm less happy especially
like during the times of playing poke
and otherwise. But then again, if you
know, if I listen to that, I

[1:36:32]
know, if I listen to that, I
would have less money than I do, you
know. But I I think generally it's yeah
something that is real as well. But um
that's probably side point that's going

[1:36:45]
that's probably side point that's going
to also answer your other questions. Um
I mostly use it for
tracking my like health physical stuff
mostly like for workouts and energy
things like this.

[1:37:01]
things like this.
I would mostly try to listen to my body
in most ways. Like, oh, do I want to
have a workout today? If I do, how hard
do I want to go? Do I want to lift?

[1:37:15]
do I want to go? Do I want to lift?
Whatever. And then like also look at it
as additional uh data as you said and
that might kind of influence me like if
I'm on the fence of whether I want to go
and I look at my data and it's great

[1:37:31]
and I look at my data and it's great
then you know I might still go or I
might try to push myself more based on
that. Um but generally I try to mostly
listen to myself especially with poker
2. I think that this I I wouldn't really

[1:37:47]
2. I think that this I I wouldn't really
use based on wanting to play at all. I
think that's just for how I feel that
day. And generally like during this
series, I'm still just like forcing
myself to play even if I don't want to.

[1:38:01]
myself to play even if I don't want to.
It's sadly the case that I'm just like
feeling that obligation of like, okay,
it's scoop, you
know, it's once a year, twice a year if
you can't W, but it's like, okay, this
is it. This is what I'm doing for this

[1:38:16]
is it. This is what I'm doing for this
time. I'm going to force myself to grind
as an obligation.
And I think actually this might be the
first year where I might not take that
mindset quite as much because I've found

[1:38:31]
mindset quite as much because I've found
out in the past from this that it just
does make me probably less miserable
over that time and especially if I burn
out a bit more and especially like I
have the World Series straight after

[1:38:46]
have the World Series straight after
it's really brutal
and I have not taken a day off like I
took one day off from
scoop last year and woop like so maybe
one other during the series but I think

[1:39:01]
one other during the series but I think
this will be the first year where I
allow myself to take more than one day
off if I want to for my own happiness
and health really and actually also just
my poker game I think when I'm forcing
myself to play as we talked about it

[1:39:15]
myself to play as we talked about it
before forcing myself when I don't want
to I think I don't play quite as well.
It's also an additional thing where you
know your ROIs drop so it's less worth
it for you to play on those days too.
When is poker most enjoyable for you and

[1:39:32]
When is poker most enjoyable for you and
how can we maybe use this answer to to
reignite some of that that fire, right?
To make poker more fun. Yeah, I like it.
I think for me it's most fun

[1:39:45]
I think for me it's most fun
when I'm playing a format that I enjoy,
which is mostly mixed games. It's a kind
of semi-casual environment in a way and

[1:40:01]
of semi-casual environment in a way and
against friends that both I get along
well with but can also challenge me as
well. So realistically for me maybe the
most fun it's close but it's either the

[1:40:16]
most fun it's close but it's either the
the PGT mix game series or the World
Series.
So the PGT mixed game series for example
that just happened.
I know at least half the people in there

[1:40:32]
I know at least half the people in there
like the
uh well the biggest field actually got
140 something people so but it I know
most of the people there and it's you
know there's banter there's camaraderie

[1:40:47]
know there's banter there's camaraderie
there's some rivalry there's things that
are kind of you know it makes things
interesting and fun but it's just like a
very cool atmosphere Uh, it's sort of
laid-back in the way that, you know,
it's in the studio. They kind of take

[1:41:01]
it's in the studio. They kind of take
care of you in that way. It's
nice.
And I do also enjoy kind of the the the
deeper runs, like the final table runs
as well. like that's fun for me, but I

[1:41:16]
as well. like that's fun for me, but I
think
realistically I've sort of come to
accept that actually that's probably
just more stressful for me then it's
like it's like
cool but it's more stressful than it is

[1:41:30]
cool but it's more stressful than it is
fun
probably and it's more like I'm trying
to play my best. I'm trying to be very
clinical. All these kind of things where
like my approach is less casual. So,
it's more kind of
those earlier stage tables or in a cash

[1:41:47]
those earlier stage tables or in a cash
game as well, I think, as well. I don't
play cash games as much as I used to,
but they have that kind of more
laid-back casual atmosphere as well,
too.
And in a scenario, it's less like, you

[1:42:02]
And in a scenario, it's less like, you
know, you're trying to take people's
rent money or their their loss money in
a ruthless way, then it's just conducive
to more fun. Big shout out to our

let's continue chatting with
Benny. It took you uh 5 years to get to

[1:43:30]
Benny. It took you uh 5 years to get to
the stakes that you're playing today.
Looking back, what do you think you
could have done uh differently or better
to improve the speed of that journey?
Yeah, probably a few things. Um I mean I
was
playing like the limit games in my early

[1:43:51]
journey in a way they were just tough to
beat with the rake and being limit games
at low stakes. It's it was quite tough.

[1:44:03]
at low stakes. It's it was quite tough.
So some of the games I focused on
playing at those times was more
for reasons of interest and like trying
to get
better rather

[1:44:17]
better rather
than focusing
on potentially like moving up mistakes,
moving up my back hole as quick as I
could,
which is obviously not necessarily a bad
thing. like it just it made me a better

[1:44:30]
thing. like it just it made me a better
player, you know, so it made me more the
player I am today, but it probably held
me back in certain ways. Like it
definitely held me back in stakes for
for quite a while. Um where as I said it
was probably a few years of playing and

[1:44:46]
was probably a few years of playing and
I was still at
like 3648 limits for a
while
and was probably not as

[1:45:02]
and was probably not as
uh money minded about that as I could
have
been. And I think I also could have
sought out resource resources probably

[1:45:16]
sought out resource resources probably
better whether it's um like a community
at that time like eventually I got into
you know 2 plus two and things like that
I had a nicer community around me had
more friends and could discuss various

[1:45:30]
more friends and could discuss various
things like that and that was helpful
but earlier I I didn't so much I was
sort of playing a bit more myself when
the first couple of years at

[1:45:45]
the first couple of years at
least. And also I was
probably a nit in some bankroll ways as
well where I was probably too
conservative in

[1:46:03]
uh I mean in a reasonable way but in
like not shot taking necessarily and
like selling action in good spots like
the World Series. that probably was too
much of a knit uh for a couple of years

[1:46:19]
much of a knit uh for a couple of years
and could not have well did not have the
bank roll boost I necessarily could have
had I not been such a nit in selling and

[1:46:31]
had I not been such a nit in selling and
how did you overcome that like a lot of
people struggle with this like risk
aversion be being too nitty
yeah yeah so I was going to say it's
like the mental game thing for me
where for a while it was still tough for

[1:46:48]
where for a while it was still tough for
me to potentially lose like X money in a
day or in a tournament. And obviously
there is conditioning like for a while
you get used well sort of used to you

[1:47:02]
you get used well sort of used to you
know losing 10k in a day whatever or
however
much where it was tough because it's
like very clearly the real world amount
was feeling quite deeply instilled in me

[1:47:16]
was feeling quite deeply instilled in me
probably where I'm still equating it to
real world things. So,
uh, actually I remember having a
conversation with good friend of mine,
Dylan Lindy, probably like 9 years ago

[1:47:32]
Dylan Lindy, probably like 9 years ago
or something. So, this was like off this
after I'd won my my
bracelet, but I was I was still like
being quite a knit. And I was saying to
him how like online like I could be

[1:47:46]
him how like online like I could be
sitting here or sitting at these cash
stakes or something but like I would
still want to sell for them or same with
these tournaments like because I don't
feel comfortable losing like four
figures every day. And he just says to
me, you should

[1:48:01]
me, you should
be you should be playing
these you should be kind of comfortable
with losing this like you know you're
good enough it will like help you in
your these kind of things

[1:48:16]
and I think that helped me in a way. It
still felt difficult for me to a for a
while to tune it out from the real world
monetary value really. It

[1:48:31]
monetary value really. It
is a difficult thing and it's probably
quite a personal thing as well. It might
be difficult to just give general advice
for that. Um, for example,
like a lot of the friends that I had

[1:48:46]
like a lot of the friends that I had
around that time were not doing so well
financially,
like, you know, like college friends or
something like this where they're still
trying to work a a second job or

[1:49:00]
trying to work a a second job or
something like this that they're
struggling to see.
And that was like often like a grounding
thing for me in terms of real world
monetary value which in a way is a
positive in a way is a negative because

[1:49:15]
positive in a way is a negative because
when you're seeing poker buyins as that
it can just hold you back where you
think god I've lost 10k in a day you
kind of feel suffering for this because
of thinking about how much it can do in
the real world something like this as

[1:49:34]
and I would still have
that feeling. So, it's
just a way of conditioning experience
was a big thing for me just trying to

[1:49:45]
was a big thing for me just trying to
get through it. And obviously building a
bank roll
is an important thing. Uh it's just very
large thing.
I'm not wearing le, but it's it's a very

[1:50:00]
I'm not wearing le, but it's it's a very
important thing in terms of how you
might think
of your monetary losses or gains
essentially too as well. I felt more
confident losing or not losing more but

[1:50:16]
confident losing or not losing more but
playing higher stakes, playing for more
of myself
when my bank roll was doing
better and it's less going to affect my
life. Having the recognition that
realistically it's not going to affect
my life. If I lose this amount in a day,

[1:50:32]
my life. If I lose this amount in a day,
a week or five times this amount in a
week, it's not really going to
realistically affect my life. I think is
probably the biggest thing if you can
kind of try and feel into that as much
as you

[1:50:45]
as you
can. Feel if it's going to realistically
change your life. Are you still just
going to be playing the same amount of
poker? What is it going to change if
anything might inop your confidence?
Might you just drop a bit lower in
stakes? Also,

[1:51:01]
stakes? Also,
if you might play differently if you're
staked or at a certain stake is an
important thing as well, but that's
again quite an individual thing. I
think or I would like to think that I

[1:51:16]
think or I would like to think that I
always
play similarly in terms of ability for
however much I have of myself or what
the stakes are like within
reason. And that's also a very important

[1:51:30]
reason. And that's also a very important
thing to have that comfort to be able to
do that. Um and yeah, just having the
feeling of the cushion and the
comfortability in real world is uh
important if you can.

[1:51:47]
important if you can.
Yeah, remind me a bit of what Adam
actually said earlier in the
conversation about thinking about okay
what's like the worst thing that can
happen and feeling that and then
realizing that everything is still okay.
If it's not okay, then maybe, you know,

[1:52:00]
If it's not okay, then maybe, you know,
you should you should recalibrate how
much risk you're willing to take, right?
And and get to the level of risk where
like, okay, worst case scenario, I'm
still okay. Uh because it's indeed
usually we make it way worse in our head
uh than it what what it actually is. Uh
you mentioned that at some point you

[1:52:15]
you mentioned that at some point you
came across uh resources, you joined
community, you found or you found more
people, two plus two. Has there ever
been a a coach or like a study partner
who had a major impact on your game? And
if so, what is the most important lesson
uh that that person taught you?

[1:52:35]
Yeah, I mean there have
been lots of friends I've spoken to over
the years, particularly for mix game and

[1:52:45]
the years, particularly for mix game and
like throughout my career, we
uh kind of rose up at the same time. The
person I spoke most with is Adam
Owen. And he's a very successful,
talented UK player for anybody who might

[1:53:02]
talented UK player for anybody who might
not know him. Uh specific or especially
in mixed games, he's had outrageous net
limit results too in very huge scores.
Um, but things he taught me,

[1:53:17]
Um, but things he taught me,
especially when I was kind of rising up,
like we started becoming good friends
about 10 years
ago. Um, well, actually a bit longer.
So, a good year or so before my

[1:53:30]
So, a good year or so before my
bracelet. So, like about 11 years
ago. And really it was
his creativity and out the box thinking
and not being afraid to look like an
idiot. Like these were really important
concepts for me. Like I I would still

[1:53:47]
concepts for me. Like I I would still
often feel insecure about things and he
wouldn't care. And in a way I admire
that and always had done. And there were

[1:54:00]
that and always had done. And there were
various kind of things
that he was doing that or or thinking
about that
were non-standard in a way that were
very interesting. And uh his kind of uh

[1:54:19]
very interesting. And uh his kind of uh
a good friend as well at the time and
sort of mentor was Cal as well who's one
of the most non-standard poker players
of all time I think it's fair to say and

[1:54:30]
of all time I think it's fair to say and
he is a also a very creative uh
interesting player so he took a lot from
him
and there are lots of like strategies in
that way that helped to kind of broaden
my thinking and broaden my horizon of

[1:54:46]
my thinking and broaden my horizon of
even like experimentation in ways of not
being afraid to look like an idiot that
you can just actually like experiment
with things and if this works, if you
think it's good, you can keep doing it.

[1:55:00]
think it's good, you can keep doing it.
And that was also an important thing of
just like trying to get better, trying
to think out the box
creatively
and all those ways that that kind of
translated my scope throughout my career

[1:55:15]
translated my scope throughout my career
I think was very uh helpful and
impactful.
What would you say has been uh some of
the most out of the box strategies you
started to experiment with?

[1:55:33]
Maybe m may maybe one that actually did
make you look like an idiot.
Wow. Um or at least in hindsight you you
you felt that way.
Some of the things like have it even

[1:55:46]
Some of the things like have it even
like since like turned out to
be good at the time. I thought was
weird, but there's certain things
like it was like that long ago, like 9
years ago where I basically first

[1:56:00]
years ago where I basically first
discovered through him that like limping
in and RA tournaments is good and like
everyone else thought that was weird.
There's like three people in the world
who did that or something and everyone
else thought it was weird. I thought it

[1:56:15]
else thought it was weird. I thought it
was weird at the time. even like
infinite elite Raz players thought it
was weird at the time. Now more people
do it as a reasonable
strategy
and like that was one thing as an
example. Also even I would remember

[1:56:33]
like one or two kind of quite major
exploits there were like in uh like
heads up sitting goes like no limit
single draw for limping as well where he

[1:56:46]
single draw for limping as well where he
would limp like 100% of hands or like
something outrageous like that was
definitely like too much. She would take
things like to way extremes sometimes
like where it's just like too much. Like
this is clearly absurd. But in certain

[1:57:00]
this is clearly absurd. But in certain
scenarios, like I remember there was
just like one opponent that he would
just like regularly play and like
consistently do that absurd scenario. I
think it was something like limp 100% of
hands in no limit single draw sitting
goes where he was just destroying him

[1:57:16]
goes where he was just destroying him
with it. And
like it did just really make me think
like, huh, is like these like real
exploits that are just so absurd can
just like potentially be profitable if
you make them work for you in certain

[1:57:30]
you make them work for you in certain
ways and if you have the right scenario
like against the right opponents.
And I think like that has clearly since
turned out to not be an optimal strategy
um especially for single draw.

[1:57:47]
um especially for single draw.
Um, I think that's probably the most
outrageous one. Um, the
I mean there are other things like
limping in no limit tournaments
outrageously wide from like under the

[1:58:01]
outrageously wide from like under the
gun as well. That was back in the day. I
I remember like him and Cal just really
egregiously like limp. I I still
remember one
thing
in Cal in a World Series event. He's at

[1:58:15]
in Cal in a World Series event. He's at
the table over with me. We're in a
conversation and uh we're talking and
then it's his turn under the gun to act.
This was yeah again like 9 years ago and
it was and the deal is telling him it's
his turn and he's like thinking while

[1:58:30]
his turn and he's like thinking while
he's talking to me, he hasn't looked at
his cards. He's like, "Oh yeah, I'll
just like he limps blind. He's like, I
know I'm going to do this anyway, so
I'll just limp blind." like this is like
the outrageous kind of things that he
would just do that, you know, clearly we
now know is not optimal, but it still

[1:58:46]
now know is not optimal, but it still
just broadened my creative thinking in a
few ways. That was cool.
Yeah. And sometimes it's the over
adjustment and over application through
which you get immediate fe the most

[1:59:00]
which you get immediate fe the most
amount of feedback, right? So you can
kind of recalibrate your strategy.
Actually, I was always I throughout my
career, I did strategy a lot with one
guy and we both kind of had the opposite
opposite approaches. We get one thing,
he would be hyper to the other side. He
would apply it massively and then kind

[1:59:15]
would apply it massively and then kind
of recalibrate and I would start slowly
starting with the best spot and then we
would end up meeting in the middle
somewhere, right? We we would agree, but
to be fair, he get he would have
gathered more feedback. So, if you're if
you're okay with, you know, uh just, you
know, using your confidence and going

[1:59:30]
know, using your confidence and going
for it, why not? I think uh and it's
like you said it's not necessarily that
that that strategy itself maybe you
learn something you get into a situation
that then triggers you to think
different about a completely different
spot right that helps but in general
just the things that then open up wow if

[1:59:45]
just the things that then open up wow if
this is possible then what else is
possible right absolutely yeah so I I
think like trial by fire is a real thing
assuming it's in environments where you
can afford to get it wrong then I think

[2:00:00]
can afford to get it wrong then I think
it's absolutely absolutely important
assuming that you're able to take the
feedback that you get in appropriate
ways and actually be critical about that
feedback and analyze it and be like okay
maybe this isn't working rather than

[2:00:16]
maybe this isn't working rather than
think about it and think oh I should try
more just because it didn't work this
time you know so actually like being
aware about the results and feedback of
yeah experimenting right not not just
being stubborn and and trying to prove

[2:00:30]
being stubborn and and trying to prove
that you're Right. Mhm. Exactly. Yeah.
Um, you bounced, you know, across a wide
range of formats over your
career. What has been like the biggest
benefits and downsides of bouncing
around so many formats?

[2:00:47]
Yeah, good question. Uh, I think it
probably hurt my
profitability in certain ways
where I

[2:01:02]
think I probably just would have been
more profitable had I just focused on
like one or two specific things and just
become the best in the world at whatever
one or two things rather than, you know,

[2:01:16]
one or two things rather than, you know,
like whatever the 20th for the five
things where like there's clearly a drop
off in that
way.
And I think doing that in my career

[2:01:32]
And I think doing that in my career
probably didn't make me the most money
frankly for a
while. But like it depends what you're
looking for. I think it allowed me more
fun. I think variety is important. I

[2:01:49]
fun. I think variety is important. I
think had I specialized in one or two
things
probably might have been less fun for
me, especially if like those were no
limit holding tournaments. Like I just

[2:02:02]
limit holding tournaments. Like I just
generally find
those not very fun and and painful and
not as enjoyable as other things like
mixed.
So I think variety for me has been

[2:02:17]
So I think variety for me has been
important in terms of both not being
bored
and sort of being hungry in a way for
different things and even like learning
different things, looking at different
things. But I would say it also makes

[2:02:33]
things. But I would say it also makes
studying difficult in some ways where a
lot of the time I sort of honestly feel
like I I don't know what I'm going to
study today or this week. Like I could
just

[2:02:45]
just
try a whole bunch of different things.
So, it's not very structured in that
way, which probably makes it less good,
I would say, and obviously results in me
not being able to be quite as good at
one or two particular things that

[2:03:00]
one or two particular things that
everyone else is if that's all they're
studying. So
obviously I'm worse at Nim Holdm when I
have 10 games to study than if someone
is only studying no limit hold as well.

[2:03:15]
is only studying no limit hold as well.
So there's that. But I'd say it's also
just like broadened my horizons in terms
of my ability of what I want to play.
And there are obviously like other
profitable avenues too if I want. And

[2:03:31]
profitable avenues too if I want. And
um what's other three? I think it just
overall made me a better poker player
when I was initially learning. Just
learning new games and getting better at
other games in certain ways and thinking

[2:03:46]
other games in certain ways and thinking
about them probably made my other games
better in certain ways. I would like to
think like both thinking about a game in
kind of fundamental theoretical ways and
also potential like maneuverable

[2:04:02]
also potential like maneuverable
exploits that you might be able to
think, huh, I could maybe do this in
this other game as well. So, I think
that was also a cool aspect.
Yeah, I was going to say that. Did you
ever have like a big aha moment studying

[2:04:15]
ever have like a big aha moment studying
one game while you were but the aha
moment was actually for a completely
different game? It's like, "Oh, wait.
But if this is true in RAZ, then induce
to seven." Huh. How would that apply
there?
Or doesn't it work like that?

[2:04:31]
Or doesn't it work like that?
It works a little bit like that. I I
guess it depends. Um, some of
the aha moments I guess were mostly sort
of linked. For example, like if playing

[2:04:46]
of linked. For example, like if playing
heads up limit holdem and I was
understanding bore textures very well
and
uh thresholds of like the thinnest value
bets like these kind of things that

[2:05:00]
bets like these kind of things that
definitely helped my no limit
game where am I going to find like how
thin can I go for value and how vortex
is going to change how thin I can go for
value as well as just like hand reading
that definitely helped but obviously

[2:05:16]
that definitely helped but obviously
those games are like very strongly
linked.
Um, I think as far as like very
different games, I I don't know. There
there are maybe like some stud games
crossovers that have similar concepts
that I've thought about uh in the past.

[2:05:31]
that I've thought about uh in the past.
Like if you're trying to think where you
might find bluffs from in certain
scenarios where if you figure out one
in Raz, you might think, huh, how could
I also do that in start high? Like these

[2:05:46]
I also do that in start high? Like these
kind of things as well.
Uh, draw I think not so much. I think
that's often like a less intuitive game
in that
scenario in certain ways at least that

[2:06:00]
scenario in certain ways at least that
it might just take more draw experience
specifically in order to get better
there. Unfortunately, yeah, I I actually
Googled the definition of a specialist
and it says a person who concentrates
primarily on a particular subject or

[2:06:15]
primarily on a particular subject or
activity. Right. So that got me
thinking, can you actually be a mixed
game specialist or is that by definition
impossible since mixed game obviously
requires uh you to spread across many
formats? Yeah, fair question. I guess it

[2:06:32]
formats? Yeah, fair question. I guess it
depends on the individual for the answer
there. Um, it is sort of like a jack of
all trades thing, but I guess it's a
specialist specialist if you count mixed

[2:06:46]
specialist specialist if you count mixed
games as as one thing, then it's like,
okay, if that's the sole thing, but if
it's the plural, then I guess
technically no. Unless there are maybe
like a couple of games I would say I I

[2:07:00]
like a couple of games I would say I I
specialize in as stronger games, but I
could say prioritize mixed games or
whatever the the wording could be that
fits the the technical
definition in mixed games. Does the edge

[2:07:16]
definition in mixed games. Does the edge
come from mastering every format or
sucking the least in all formats? you
know, is it about uh minimizing your
weaknesses or is it about maximizing
your strengths given the fact that you

[2:07:30]
your strengths given the fact that you
know, you have so many formats to study?
Yeah, good question. I I think well it
sort of
depends how much you might suck, right?
Like
if you're so much lower than everybody

[2:07:48]
if you're so much lower than everybody
else, clearly there's going to be more
EV in bringing that back end up by a
lot. If a lot of your games are are
similar, then it might depend really.

[2:08:00]
similar, then it might depend really.
And
even you can potentially focus on
higher edge games like higher ROI
games in order
to improve your ROI in those games like

[2:08:16]
to improve your ROI in those games like
let's say probably there's more scope
for improvement and ROI in the big bet
games no limit pillow and single draw
than let's say stud. There's going to be
a lot of sort of mediocre to

[2:08:31]
a lot of sort of mediocre to
slightly weaker players making like
somewhat losing mistakes, but they're
not really costing you a ton of EV
maybe. And like the best stud players
maybe not like hugely making a lot more

[2:08:45]
maybe not like hugely making a lot more
EV than the good or mediocre stud
players. In comparison to other games, I
think it's more important to
be better. There's a larger edge in
those games between the best and someone
who's just like mediocre good in no

[2:09:01]
who's just like mediocre good in no
limit single draw and PLO. I think
there's a bigger difference there. So,
if you want to focus on those, I think
that would be more important as well. as
well
as not sucking to at least a baseline

[2:09:15]
as not sucking to at least a baseline
level, like having at least a reasonable
kind of baseline that you're going to
play relatively solid in in those games.
Uh I think it's a probably reasonable
approach and then depending on the event

[2:09:31]
approach and then depending on the event
or the table for how much you might want
to target your opponents in games in
that way to what you want to improve.
So if I got from that, basically it's
both. You try to suck suck less in the

[2:09:46]
both. You try to suck suck less in the
games where the room for edge I guess is
smaller and you try to maximize your
strengths in the games where there's
actually more to maximize on, more to
capitalize on.
I think so. Yeah, I think I

[2:10:01]
I think so. Yeah, I think I
think I think that's fair to say. I
would guess like as a general rule, I
would hope most people would agree with
that.
Yeah. I also I read that you are
naturally mathematically minded. Does it

[2:10:16]
naturally mathematically minded. Does it
help you in studying a wide range of
games?
I would hope so.
um

[2:10:31]
um
just the way of somehow
you naturally can analyze things
hopefully a bit more easier than
otherwise.
Um, I'd say it didn't make it easier for

[2:10:48]
Um, I'd say it didn't make it easier for
me to like study solver outputs though
and like finding huristics and patterns
I think is a different skill to that.

[2:11:00]
I think is a different skill to that.
So I think that still didn't come very
easily to me especially in no limit
holdem I had difficulty there
with studying those kind of solver
outputs
and finding reasons why like that was

[2:11:17]
and finding reasons why like that was
important for me like I think in order
for
execution to be good kind of across the
board and have transferable concepts it
was important for me to work out why
things are happening and I still

[2:11:31]
things are happening and I still
couldn't necessarily translate that from
a solver then that was still tough for
me for mold
especially for studying other games I
think probably did help me yeah in terms
of just more clearly seeing say a range

[2:11:47]
of just more clearly seeing say a range
verse range in pro cocoa tool something
like this just like percentages of how
that's going to work even in regards to
kind of like
uh pot odds you need or or something

[2:12:00]
uh pot odds you need or or something
like this.
How profitable of a jam range you can
have
in no limit 08 for example with the anti
structure and then maybe how you can
adjust that by somebody's calling range.

[2:12:16]
adjust that by somebody's calling range.
So I think those kind of things were
probably
helpful and looking at uh odds like that
uh I think
was reasonably straightforward for me.

[2:12:33]
Yeah. Over the years uh you've also
developed a passion for coaching. Uh our
audience loves to be taught same as me.
Uh, so I want to do a little mixed game

[2:12:45]
Uh, so I want to do a little mixed game
coaching session with you right here on
the pot. Now, every game is obviously
different. It's still poker. So, let's
maybe we should start off with the
common ground. Uh, so what do all poker
formats have in common? Maybe we can use
no limit, hold them to explain this

[2:13:01]
no limit, hold them to explain this
since that's what both me and probably
the audience is most familiar with. You
already mentioned, for example, you
mentioned range versus range, odds. You
know, these things I I assume remain the
same, right? I have limited knowledge
about all games. Okay. If you give me
four cards, I know a little bit, but

[2:13:15]
four cards, I know a little bit, but
after that, I'm lost.
Yeah, these things do generally remain
the same. There's still going to be a
range versus another range. And
especially in different positions and
in tournaments, for example, you're

[2:13:33]
in tournaments, for example, you're
incentivized to deal the blinds. You're
obviously incentivized to accumulate
chips. The blinds are going to go
up. you're trying to get chips from
winning the blinds. That's theoretically

[2:13:45]
winning the blinds. That's theoretically
the easiest way to win chips is if
everybody faults in that way. Uh limit
games are even more incentivized to do
that actually because the blinds are
relatively doubled in that and they're
just relatively even more important. So

[2:14:02]
just relatively even more important. So
winning blinds that way is more
important for you. a lesson there if you
want and even to the point of
where you might play more three bets in
limit in certain scenarios in order to

[2:14:17]
limit in certain scenarios in order to
try and knock the blinds out in order to
just try and win the pot versus the
other person. So in lim hold or 08 for
example then the button might be three

[2:14:30]
example then the button might be three
betting like almost all the hands versus
the cutter for example essentially just
trying to win the blinds and then if you
chop from there that's fine you've
chopped the blinds that's still a
profitable result and range versus range
still applies in all games let's say

[2:14:46]
still applies in all games let's say
stud games you can probably intuitively
think these kind of things where if
under the gun has opened he's probably
got a tighter range than if the person
master act opens, they're in the steel
position. So, those are kind of things

[2:15:02]
position. So, those are kind of things
that hopefully thinking poker players
can intuitit in some ways and transfer
to other games.
And as far as like just general poker
concepts go,

[2:15:16]
concepts go,
then you know your EV from things is
going to come from your value hands and
you're going to have essentially
your buffs, your offsets from those from
the value hands which you should work
around. Think about how you're going to

[2:15:31]
around. Think about how you're going to
have those in every scenario in every
game basically as well.
All right. Well, that's that's at least
the common ground. Now, as for uh let's
let's let's keep it to mistakes to

[2:15:45]
let's let's keep it to mistakes to
avoid, right? We would all like to be
excellent, but I don't think that's
realistic in the time frame that we
have. So, let's try to focus on sucking
less. Let's go like game by game and
give like some uh some tips. Okay, this
is very important in this game. Don't do
this to not screw up, right? Let's start

[2:16:02]
this to not screw up, right? Let's start
with that. You already touched a little
bit on limit. What changes if we get
dealt four cards compared to two cards,
for example, right? we switch to PLO.
What do we have to take in consideration
in order to not suck?

[2:16:15]
in order to not suck?
In order to not suck, well, PLO equities
run closer than in no limit. You get
four cards, more chances with more
cards, more things can
happen. Uh so then obviously more

[2:16:30]
happen. Uh so then obviously more
chances to make the nuts. The value
threshold of things are now going to go
down post swap. So, you know, the second
or third not flushed by the river on an
unpaired board might not be as valuable

[2:16:48]
unpaired board might not be as valuable
as no limit, might not be worth as much
as a pot bet in whatever scenario.
Similarly, the board has paired on the
river. Second or third not flush now,
not looking so great. Might not

[2:17:01]
not looking so great. Might not
necessarily be worth triple barrel,
whatever it is.
So these kind of things on a sort of
basic level to watch out for to think
of just yeah not making huge mistakes in

[2:17:18]
of just yeah not making huge mistakes in
that way. uh PLO tournaments, assuming
they have anties, is an important thing
cuz otherwise no anti-PLO tournaments.
Unfortunately, the answer is to play
kind of quite tragically tight in a lot

[2:17:31]
kind of quite tragically tight in a lot
of
scenarios. And
uh obviously at certain stack depth,
it's going to change. Higher stack
depths, it's more important to make the
nuts. Similar with no limit, like the
pots are going to get bigger. Yeah. More

[2:17:47]
pots are going to get bigger. Yeah. More
important to do this. uh in PLO don't
fold to three bets very often. Uh in
fact very rarely in a lot of
scenarios but obviously if you have

[2:18:02]
scenarios but obviously if you have
opponents that you think there are only
three betting aces you would rather call
hands that do better against aces than
worse. So you can hopefully intuit it
that something

[2:18:15]
that something
like ace king 73 or something with a
seven high suit sort of reasonable as
raw equity hand but against a three bet
versus opponent who's doing that with
probably only aces very bad hand

[2:18:31]
probably only aces very bad hand
probably just
fold you'd rather have the like 9865
double suited by a long way so in order
to also hopefully not make yourself

[2:18:45]
to also hopefully not make yourself
transparent. Try not to also only three
bet aces so you can hopefully try to see
these concepts from from both sides of
the spectrum as well to try to make
yourself tougher to play
against. I hope that covers What about
the fact that you know four cards in the

[2:19:02]
the fact that you know four cards in the
deck instead of two? Does that become
increasingly more important?
It in your decision making it does. um
you can think about how those other two
cards might interact with the boards in

[2:19:16]
cards might interact with the boards in
certain scenarios. So, if you want to
get into some further kind of in-depth
strategy where you might have uh a turn
spot or I mean I guess can even apply on

[2:19:30]
spot or I mean I guess can even apply on
every street but in a way where you
might sort of randomize a frequency in
no limit for if you're see betting
something half the time on the flop
turn. Now
on now in PLO you have other two cards

[2:19:46]
on now in PLO you have other two cards
that might help your decision in that
where if you have no relevant blockers
you might just turn that C bet to zero
and if you have helpful ones you might
just turn it to 100 and use those as
your potential randomizer if that's how

[2:20:00]
your potential randomizer if that's how
you want to do it. Also, the other thing
is card removal is more important where
if you're the button now and however
many five people have folded in front of
you, this is now more meaningful when
it's 20 cards that have folded in front

[2:20:16]
it's 20 cards that have folded in front
of you rather than just 10. So now your
button range is probably going to be
different when it's eight-handed then
versus when it's three-handed as well.
M yeah I think they call the bunching

[2:20:32]
M yeah I think they call the bunching
effect. Could be wrong here. Yeah. So
like it would like bunch I mean it's
already a thing in no limit holding but
yeah I can imagine PLO. Yeah. Mhm. Yeah.
Absolutely. So eighthanded tournament
your small blind first in it's not as

[2:20:46]
your small blind first in it's not as
great as that it initially looks. No not
really. I mean again without anti that's
yeah going to be tied up but none.
Well, what if we um let me see what's

[2:21:00]
Well, what if we um let me see what's
the next game? I guess we have Omar and
then we have the high low variant. I
guess this is the one that you were
playing mostly correct in the beginning
of your career. Omar 8 high low better.
Help me out there. Yes. Correct. Yes. Hy
low. Yeah. 08 is probably the easest

[2:21:17]
low. Yeah. 08 is probably the easest
shortand Omaha 8 is the eight or better.
And
uh just 08 is limit. If you say that if
you want you can say LO8 or FO8 but

[2:21:30]
you want you can say LO8 or FO8 but
generally is it automatically high low
or is that then a new variant? So so
eight is the eight or better means high
low. Okay. So to to clarify the low
element has to be five cards that are

[2:21:45]
element has to be five cards that are
eight or
better
unpaired. Hope that makes sense. So
every time it's eight or better then
it's hy low. There's generally not ever
a hyo that is different to eight or

[2:22:00]
a hyo that is different to eight or
better. Hy low as a format is basically
always that. Same with stud 8 for
example. Stud high low it's the same
thing. And yeah. So how does high low
how does how high low change things?

[2:22:16]
how does how high low change things?
A lot. There is often going to be a pop
that is
chopped and often you're going to want
to try to not have that
happen. Often either by trying to win

[2:22:30]
happen. Often either by trying to win
the pot at some point and making your
opponent fold or scooping. So showdowns
or not are going to become more
important in this game.
generally you're actually incentivized
to just try to get people to fold more

[2:22:46]
to just try to get people to fold more
often than not. So yeah, limit 08 was
what I played um a lot of in cash back
in the day just as a grind for like
Supernova for
example
and is yeah still one of my best games

[2:23:02]
and is yeah still one of my best games
these days
and the hyo
aspect trying to think how to sort of
basically say you often want to

[2:23:16]
basically say you often want to
have Hands that are going to be able to
win both sides of the pot generally. So
hands that have both some high and low
equity are best.
Otherwise, if you think your hand can

[2:23:30]
Otherwise, if you think your hand can
only win half of the pot, then in a way
you want to build that half of the pot
and have more people into the pot. So,
it can be a potentially creative game in
terms of how you can maneuver the action

[2:23:47]
terms of how you can maneuver the action
for how many people you want in the pot
based on the hand that you have and also
its interaction with the board. But that
applies both pre flop and post flop. So
if you have a stuce 34 for example in

[2:24:02]
if you have a stuce 34 for example in
the hijack and the lowjack has opened
you have very very good low hand it
might not necessarily have high
capability and also can just completely
brick the flop if it comes queen jack 9

[2:24:15]
brick the flop if it comes queen jack 9
then you can just flat call in that
scenario and then you either can let
more people into the pot and thus build
like the low part of it when you are
going to have a very good low hand or in
a way minimize your loss when it comes

[2:24:32]
a way minimize your loss when it comes
queen jack n and it's like okay I've
lost two big blinds I'm out and
similarly you can do that with high
hands as well if you want and you have
the king queen jack 10

[2:24:45]
the king queen jack 10
double similar kind of concepts going to
happen you can potentially flat that
it's not such a great hand necessarily
in this game um but hypothetically if
you were supposed to flat that or like
king king queen jack double something

[2:25:00]
king king queen jack double something
like this then if the board is 345 and
there are four people in there you can
just fold for one bet otherwise when it
does come high you can
uh curate the action in a way of letting

[2:25:16]
uh curate the action in a way of letting
more people in to win a higher uh a
larger pot that way functionally
yeah it seems very similar in in live
cash no limit told them if you play a
double board, it's kind of the same,
right? You either want to bluff the

[2:25:30]
right? You either want to bluff the
other guy off the chop or you want more
more money to chop it up. Absolutely.
Yeah. So, very similar. Yeah. Let's say
that there's a river scenario in three
ways and you have one locked up and not
on either not on the other then if you
bet pot then you either want two calls

[2:25:47]
bet pot then you either want two calls
or zero calls. It's kind of the thing.
And same with stud A2. It's the concept
of uh pushpull where you can kind of
either pull people into the poll or like
push them out if you want to try to get

[2:26:01]
push them out if you want to try to get
a heads up.
All right. Well, let's switch to I guess
start because that's also a hyo variant.
Uh I think the main thing that now
changes is there's no more public cards,
but you get all cards dealt to you.

[2:26:16]
but you get all cards dealt to you.
Correct. So start two down cards, one
up. Everyone can see your up card. So
more information this way. This is
important to try and remember that
information. So if you're a beginner to

[2:26:31]
information. So if you're a beginner to
stud, then you want to try to remember
what other people's up cards are cuz
then you just have more information. You
know the seven of spades is there or you
know this person has their ace of clubs.
So it's less person less likely that

[2:26:45]
So it's less person less likely that
this other person has a pair of aces if
they're in the other seat. So this is
obviously going to be valuable to you.
Same with in Raz. This is very
important. Like not the suits, but if
you just know the dead carter do 55 and

[2:27:01]
you just know the dead carter do 55 and
you're playing against someone else who
has a four up but then catches a five,
you know it's very unlikely they've
paired their five.
So these kind of reasons where it's
important and
then yeah you get the next three cards

[2:27:17]
then yeah you get the next three cards
all up. So fourth, fifth and sixth as
you would call it up and then seventh is
face down. So to you uh personally and
then there are anties everybody anties

[2:27:31]
then there are anties everybody anties
and there is uh what's called a bringin.
So it's the worst up card brings in
where the action is then going to start
from there. It's almost like a blind.
It's a forced bet. So in start

[2:27:49]
It's a forced bet. So in start
high the worst possible card is a deuce
of clubs. The suits also go in
alphabetical order where clubs is the
worst. So if someone else has a deuce of

[2:28:01]
worst. So if someone else has a deuce of
spades, another person has a deuce of
clubs. The deuce of clubs is the bringin
and they're going to put in some amount.
Let's say it's two
anties of an amount and then action goes
from the person straight after the bring

[2:28:15]
from the person straight after the bring
in and it goes around in that same
clockwise order.
So again, this is where positions are
important where under the gun is now to
the person to the right of the
bringin. his range is going to be a lot

[2:28:30]
bringin. his range is going to be a lot
tighter in pretty much every game
than if they're second last to act. But
it depends on people's up cards. So if
it's in Raz and the person left of right
the bring in is a deuce then it is left

[2:28:48]
the bring in is a deuce then it is left
of the sorry left of the ring then it is
a deuce and then everybody else has uh
kings and queens then they could steal
very liberally. So you'd still probably
call it a steal in that regard, but it's

[2:29:02]
call it a steal in that regard, but it's
obviously like a very favorable board.
Same with start high. If the person
under the gun has an ace and everyone
else has twos and threes, ace can also
steal very liberally as well. So yeah.

[2:29:15]
steal very liberally as well. So yeah.
So that's kind of the bluffing. You're
you're kind of representing your up
card. So basically, you know the up
card. So if you have good up cards, but
your down cards are [ __ ] Hey, they
don't know. And if they have shitty, but
if they have shitty up cards, well, it's
unlikely they have a hand. Can you then
also like from a bluffing aspect, let's

[2:29:30]
also like from a bluffing aspect, let's
say you have good upgards showing, but I
have bad up I have bad upging, but I
still show aggression, then I'm
basically representing that my down
cards are very bad. Or how does that
work? Is that kind of the bluffing
aspect? Yeah, absolutely. I mean,
hopefully most people can kind of figure

[2:29:45]
hopefully most people can kind of figure
that out that like obviously the the
bluffing aspect happens a lot where
people are representing something and
you can kind of have some discernment
for that. But remember this is a limit
game so it's kind of limited in how much

[2:30:02]
game so it's kind of limited in how much
the the bluffing can be done in a way
and you know on a river scenario in a
limit game you still want your
frequencies to be reasonable where if
the the player is getting 10 to one you
know they just call one in 10 times to

[2:30:16]
know they just call one in 10 times to
to have a profitable call. So if you're
bluffing half the time it's not great
like that on the river. So you would
ever play it in a in a non-limit format
because then I can see bluffing. You
know, you have shitty you have shitty
whole cards showing but you do put your
stack and it's like well you decide if

[2:30:31]
stack and it's like well you decide if
my other cards are better or not. Yes.
But it's it's pretty rare frankly. It's
probably not the best game. I've played
it like once maybe twice in my life like
uh it's been pot limit uh as well but

[2:30:48]
uh it's been pot limit uh as well but
it's almost never played as no limit any
of the games but I played it like pot
limit like once or twice and it's
definitely an interesting game but yeah
pretty

[2:31:00]
rare then I guess Ras is the next right
that's most similar that's kind of for
the people that always complain that
they run bad because now you should
shouldn't make a hand Right.
Yeah. But then again, Raz is probably
the game where people complain most

[2:31:15]
the game where people complain most
about actually kind of ironically in
that way because that's the game where
it's very run out
dependent. Like you can start with ace
deuce three in the hole. That's the best
possible three starting cards in Raz,

[2:31:31]
possible three starting cards in Raz,
but you can just run out the king, king,
queen, jack, and then you know you're
going to have a bad time. or even like
you're just gonna have to automatically
fold fifth or something if you catch
king king and your you know your
opponent's board is 345 you know so it's

[2:31:49]
opponent's board is 345 you know so it's
probably the one that's most s
susceptible to people moaning about
because of the boards cuz there's like
there's just nothing they can do they
just have to fold fifth or sixth
automatically because that's what the
dealer has dealt them you know it's yeah

[2:32:03]
dealer has dealt them you know it's yeah
so what's kind of the like on both ST
and res what is the skill
aspect. I'm trying to uh obviously I
understand that the skill but how can we

[2:32:15]
understand that the skill but how can we
leverage the skill aspect if we cannot
bluff people off our hands and is it
just like you said keeping track of
what's the card? So who can best
memorize and understand how the card
removal increases chances of someone
having hands and not having hands?

[2:32:30]
having hands and not having hands?
The memorization is a small aspect but
it's like relatively small in terms of
what the overall skill are. There are
various things that I think most like
thinking poker players are able to
translate to things like I mean as I

[2:32:48]
translate to things like I mean as I
said frequencies are going to be
important on rivers. So you can kind of
think about how you're going to play
Xhand in order for the river frequencies
to be most important.

[2:33:00]
to be most important.
But sure along the way you can have a
higher bluff frequency if
you're well you have more fold equity
and you're representing your boards. Uh
another thing is that should be
transferable hopefully is to not be

[2:33:16]
transferable hopefully is to not be
transparent in certain ways. So
hopefully you can think about how you
can balance certain scenarios as well
and how to be tougher to play against
and how you can

[2:33:31]
potentially dictate bets in order for
that to happen. Like you know there are
certain still creative plays like you
can wait until a later street before you
raise something like this. You can only

[2:33:45]
raise something like this. You can only
call on fourth but raise on fifth or
sixth just as an example there
where you might still have a hand. But
board reading in general is very
important. It's like hand reading in

[2:34:01]
important. It's like hand reading in
hold thinking about
ranges. You can think about B texture
how it might interact with a range.
someone else
instead is sort of similar where you're
trying to read their board. What is

[2:34:16]
trying to read their board. What is
their most likely whole cards or what
are their whole range of whole cards
based on all the action until now based
on their third range? Like if it's a a
two bet on third verse an open and

[2:34:31]
two bet on third verse an open and
they've reer raised then the range is
obviously going to be a lot more
condensed. Similar with like three
betting in no limit. It's a much
more well the range is going to be
structured in a certain way whereas you

[2:34:46]
structured in a certain way whereas you
know let's say they they flat plus one
verse under the gun. That's a more
specifically condensed range in certain
scenarios,
but it's a range that's going to be
shaped in certain ways. So, think given
that range and then how their board has

[2:35:01]
that range and then how their board has
run out, sort of their most likely range
of hands, how are you doing verse that
range? And then another important
concept is visibility and equity
realization where you can think about
that in no limit too where let's say

[2:35:17]
that in no limit too where let's say
you're big line verse under the gun and
it's a board that's very favorable for
the under the gun opener like you know
ace king jack and you've defended the
the jack deuce suited something like
this

[2:35:30]
this
where you might have correct price to to
call flop versus B50 or thing, but it's
it's not a great scenario without a
backdoor flush draw because your equity
equity realization on later streets is
obviously going to be very poor. So,

[2:35:46]
obviously going to be very poor. So,
think about
how how many scenarios you might have to
just essentially automatically fold on a
later street in a stud. So in Raz, let's
say you have kind of a close fifth call

[2:36:00]
say you have kind of a close fifth call
scenario. Think about are you going to
be able to realize the equity on sixth
or are you just going to have to
automatically fold on like 30% of the
deck which might just happen very easily
where the opponent's board is 3 4 5

[2:36:16]
where the opponent's board is 3 4 5
whatever. if they just catch a stew,
six, seven, you know, all these cards
that you're just gonna have to
automatically fold if your board is
three, like you have three, four, five,
whatever it is, and have pay.

[2:36:30]
whatever it is, and have pay.
So, these scenarios that
hopefully if you're kind of a deep
thinking poker player, you can think
about in certain ways to help you make
possibly be decisions.

[2:36:45]
Maybe al something important to add.
Actually, you you explained me this
prior prior to the podcast that even
though limit games, you know, there's
less betting volume, I guess, but you
did mention that in a 10 game mix, for
example, these games play way bigger,

[2:37:00]
example, these games play way bigger,
right? The blinds are way bigger. So,
investing that one big mo one one bet
more with bad accurate retention
actually is quite can be quite a big
proportion of your stack. Correct. Like
even like in in my head when I think
limit cash game but these limit bets

[2:37:15]
limit cash game but these limit bets
there actually can be every bet you
really have to think about because you
don't have so many bets. Correct.
Absolutely. Yeah. Especially on later
streets. So turns and rivers when it's a
big bet they're called the big bet
streets when they double versus the flop

[2:37:30]
streets when they double versus the flop
then they're absolutely more meaningful.
Yeah.
Great. I think the last two games,
correct me if I'm wrong, do have a
triple do but Doogie. Any quick insights
for players who never touched on these
formats.
Yeah. So there's also no limit single

[2:37:48]
Yeah. So there's also no limit single
draw is the other game of 10 game as
well.
Okay. I don't know if you which is Seems
like you didn't no clue. You know who
you is that the mafia poker. Mafia
poker.

[2:38:01]
poker.
Yeah. You know where it's like in the in
the past you have the gangster they have
five hands and they uh I think you're
thinking that's that's I call I call
that mafia poker I don't know what the
correct term high that you're thinking
of just five card draw yeah like a draw
game right you yeah you stand pat

[2:38:17]
game right you yeah you stand pat
yes so I think that the the mafia poker
is five card draw high where it's just
the best absolute five card hand where
you know royal flush is still best and
you have one draw street which by the

[2:38:31]
you have one draw street which by the
way is but that's not included. Correct.
Correct. No, it's included in the the
dealer's choice, but not in 10 game. But
I I also think it's it's a pretty good
game actually and it's it's a very tough

[2:38:45]
game actually and it's it's a very tough
game to to be good at. I think lots of
people play it badly honestly. Um but
that's like in in Scoop for example.
Yeah. In WQ. Yeah. I I think that that's
a game that's very hard to be balanced
in actually. Like that's one of the

[2:39:00]
in actually. Like that's one of the
toughest games in certain ways that you
kind of have to be thinking in-depthly
about that most people don't do because
they hardly ever play it. So I think
most people even like good poker players
are not very good at it frankly. So even

[2:39:15]
are not very good at it frankly. So even
sometimes like that's the game I call in
dealer's choice because I think most
people suck at it and don't play it
really. Uh but yeah, for the other
games, there's no limit single draw,
which is actually my favorite game. Uh
and that's due to 7 where you have one

[2:39:34]
and that's due to 7 where you have one
draw, single draw, and it's no limit
both before the draw and after it. So
because of that there's quite a lot of
room for maneuverability and some
creativity and things like that

[2:39:48]
creativity and things like that
where I think people who you know don't
think about it very deeply
uh there's a big edge to be had there
and I think it's a very creative game

[2:40:01]
and I think it's a very creative game
that can be intuitive for thinking poker
players. It's a game that has
classically been the case where if
you're good and then you suddenly like
try that for the first time, then you

[2:40:15]
try that for the first time, then you
can still have skills that translate to
it. You can still be thinking about it
in certain cool ways. Uh it's the game
that like multiple people had never
played it before at the World Series and
then played it for the first time and
won the bracelet in that event. That's

[2:40:30]
won the bracelet in that event. That's
happened multiple times. And so if we
want to if we want to rate like raw
poker IQ, we put all the Holden players
in in Duca 7 and see who's really
talented at poker pretty much. Yeah,
that's genuinely a great way. Like if
none of them have ever played it before,
I think that would be great. Genuinely.

[2:40:47]
I think that would be great. Genuinely.
Uh even for me, I remember that was
maybe like one of the first tournaments
I won. It was a free roll of like 4,000
because the first time first day I've
ever played that game. I I won the free
roll. I still remember on Stars like
infinite years ago that that I was super

[2:41:00]
infinite years ago that that I was super
happy with. Um so so that's yeah my
favorite game. I think it's a very good
game and uh yeah then triple draw as
well is also one of my best games where

[2:41:17]
uh less about bluffing there like it's
limit your bluffs essentially there it's
tough because most of them either you
have to give up equity of drawing so

[2:41:31]
have to give up equity of drawing so
that's something that's like potentially
tough
to get your head around as a new player
to that game. So,
you're that that's that's getting quite
advanced into the secrets. I don't know

[2:41:45]
advanced into the secrets. I don't know
how much I want to go into that. Um, but
you're essentially deciding if you want
to draw to and have equity from the draw
or give up the equity that you would
gain in order to now essentially bluff.
And
then most typically bluffs are going to

[2:42:02]
then most typically bluffs are going to
come after you have drawn whether it's
like a one verse one scenario where each
player has drawn one on the third draw.
So it's triple draw their three draws
and then bet after that. But again

[2:42:16]
and then bet after that. But again
there's a limited amount you can do when
it's limit. It is also played pot limit
and no limit sometimes but that's rarer.
Pot limit does play big. is in the
dealer's choice and that's also a very
tough game to to play and be balanced at

[2:42:32]
tough game to to play and be balanced at
like really tough to actually play it
well. But in the limit version, you kind
of have to have your frequencies
relatively in check to not be super
exploited. Yeah.

[2:42:45]
Any any other game we missed? Maybe any
game that you have personally sort of
invented that that you really like? Um I
was going to say I forgot about Boogie
actually. with your other question
there. Yeah. Yeah. That

[2:43:00]
there. Yeah. Yeah. That
is
again an interesting game that it's
again one of the games that's toughest
to be balanced in. In essence, it's
simple. So for those that don't know the
rules of Buggi, you want to try and get
four different suits. It's a full card

[2:43:15]
four different suits. It's a full card
game with three draws with the best
possible hand is ace 2, three, four. So,
it's a low ball game and they should all
ideally be different
suits. All the bedoogies rank backwards

[2:43:32]
suits. All the bedoogies rank backwards
in order where the worst possible bed is
going to be king, queen, jack, 10 of all
different suits. The next best hand
after that is a three card which is
going to be ace two three and a fourth

[2:43:45]
going to be ace two three and a fourth
card of the same suit or of a pair has
to be unpaired.
So, I hope that makes sense and can
hopefully illustrate why it might be
difficult to kind of be balanced in

[2:44:00]
difficult to kind of be balanced in
certain ways on later streets in terms
of how you're going to bet and raise and
how many you're going to draw in certain
ways. Uh, I think it's a cool game.
I sort of have come to like it a bit

[2:44:17]
I sort of have come to like it a bit
more than I used to. Partly because of
those tougher reasons of like trying to
figure it out. I used to just sort of
think, ah, this is a tough game
and sort of not try and actually be very

[2:44:32]
and sort of not try and actually be very
good at it because of that because I
just realized how it was tough. And then
more recently, I think I kind of leaned
into it a little bit more, which has
increased my uh enjoyment of it. And I

[2:44:45]
increased my uh enjoyment of it. And I
think I've got better at it recently
because of
that.
So, I would always encourage people to
try all of these games, by the way,
especially something like that. It's
very different poker game. Like that's
definitely not going to be something

[2:45:00]
definitely not going to be something
that anyone's used to or has any kind of
frame of reference for where like
obviously something like Limit Holdem to
No Limit Holdem is very close but Boogie
is probably just going to be feeling
like an alien game to most people. So

[2:45:15]
like an alien game to most people. So
generally I would recommend people start
with something like no limit single draw
where like some of the transferable
concepts are easier to bridge between
the two games and then hopefully dip
your feet into the dust 7 triple draw or
even Boogie um you know like Scoop

[2:45:34]
even Boogie um you know like Scoop
places like that where they have the
lowest buyins there are great places to
try for that like the $11 and $22 if you
just want to try for the first time. If
you don't like it, then fair enough. But

[2:45:46]
you don't like it, then fair enough. But
yeah, I think they're just very
interesting for a game point of view and
even just for your your poker mind,
hopefully. And is there anything that
I've invented? I don't think there's
there's some obscure games that we have

[2:46:02]
there's some obscure games that we have
played for sure. I not necessarily that
I've invented. We've had like there are
certain sort of more degenerate games
like even like flip games, things like
that where you know you might start with

[2:46:15]
that where you know you might start with
seven cards and you have uh a hold hand
an Omaha hand and then a one card hand
for example and you're running out
boards for each one and you're playing
like these kind of things. There's
uh a couple of common ones in

[2:46:30]
uh a couple of common ones in
particular. There's one that's been
quite
uh popular in places like Vegas the last
year and a bit was
uh Albert flips. Um which is that

[2:46:46]
uh Albert flips. Um which is that
concept the the flips. Albert flips
because a person called Albert
uh invented them. The reason I laughed
is because the more common slash
slightly insulting term for them was

[2:47:00]
slightly insulting term for them was
Lebanese flips because Albert's Lebanese
and but that's the more common name for
it for how it uh transpired. But yeah,
it's those kind of concepts in essence
and then there's uh one or two more

[2:47:16]
and then there's uh one or two more
concepts that are probably more
complicated and might not necessarily
need to get into, but that's like a fun
game where there's a little bit of skill
edge to be had and it's pretty fun. Like
there's a lot of swings and, you know,

[2:47:31]
there's a lot of swings and, you know,
still a lot of luck involved there. It's
a fun game.
Sounds I mean the the last time I played
in a in a home game, we were playing
with a mix of no limit holding players
and Omaha players. We were like, well,

[2:47:45]
and Omaha players. We were like, well,
which game do we play? Because it's
obviously not fair, you know, and then
we decided that we get tell three cards.
So, we're not two, not four. So, we went
in the middle. Uh, and but you can use
all three. So, we call it power hold.
So, it was good because none no one knew

[2:48:01]
So, it was good because none no one knew
what the hell that we were doing. And
basically on every flop, every flop
basically anyone could have quads
because you can have, for example, three
threes in your hand and there's a three
on the flop and the board might be king
king A3 rainbow. You're like, it's
pretty good, right? My top two pair, you

[2:48:16]
pretty good, right? My top two pair, you
know, or something like that. No quads.
It's obviously very hard to make, but
and we played it no limit as well. So,
we played we call it power holdm. I
don't know if it if if they already knew
it or but I I was I was at least under
the assumption that this was the first

[2:48:30]
the assumption that this was the first
time everyone was playing it. Um, which
is fun because then then no one no one
no one has a clue what they're doing.
Yeah, I've played that recently
actually. It was a side event at the WPT
in Cambodia. It's the first time I
played it. It's called Super Holdem.

[2:48:46]
played it. It's called Super Holdem.
Yeah, Super Holdm. Oh, we I thought it
was power hold. That looks Is it no
limit or are there any rules that I was
not playing? It was no limit. Yeah. So,
no, you you had it right. That was it is
no limit. three cards. And as you said,

[2:49:02]
no limit. three cards. And as you said,
it took us like a good 20 minutes at
least to work out how to be able to read
the board and how to be able to use like
all your cards. Like I would just forget
20 minutes. That's fast, man. I spent
the whole night trying to figure it out.

[2:49:16]
the whole night trying to figure it out.
But that it was Yeah, it was genuinely
really bad. Like people were misreading
hands and boards. like the the first
time like I saw a guy get it all in with
like 1083 all clubs and you know

[2:49:31]
like 1083 all clubs and you know
initially I was just thinking like he's
just a complete whale. What what the
hell is he doing? He's just trying to
gamble and then I'm like oh you're
actually like more likely to make the
flush not less likely to make the flush.
Whereas like if you had a tri suit in

[2:49:46]
Whereas like if you had a tri suit in
PLO or something you're less likely to
make it. And these kind of things as
well where I would just forget that
you're able to make quads as you had it
as well. And even that you can have two
pairs in very weird scenarios as well.

[2:50:01]
pairs in very weird scenarios as well.
Like the board can be king 83 and your
hand can be 558. Then you have two pair
that scenario.
And the reason I was uh putting my face

[2:50:16]
And the reason I was uh putting my face
in my hand a bit when you were saying
that is cuz I was remembering some of
the things in Cambodia. The guy who uh
actually finished fifth on final table.
So I I actually railed my friend. So I
like uh bubbled it. But a couple of my

[2:50:30]
like uh bubbled it. But a couple of my
friends made the final table and my
friend got heads up. So we were just
railing that just like it was a really
fun game to rail honestly. And the
person who bust in fifth, we only
realized just after the hand that he
mistakenly bust. He should have won the

[2:50:46]
mistakenly bust. He should have won the
hand, but nobody of the five people or
the dealer could read the board
probably. Yeah. And that that
was brutal to realize, but that just
kind Yeah. Yeah. So we we it was an

[2:51:02]
kind Yeah. Yeah. So we we it was an
unpaired board and we didn't realize
that he rivered runner boat and we just
thought that a straight was the winner.
So he got eliminated with a boat and my
other friend like after the hand railing

[2:51:15]
other friend like after the hand railing
with me he's like oh he keep he had a
boat didn't he have a boat like which is
like oh my god this is terrible we
realized too late. Yeah
yeah it's a it's a fun game. So what
what what have you found out about the
starting hand ranking? Do you want to

[2:51:30]
starting hand ranking? Do you want to
have like triple aces or do you prefer
like a ace king queen three hearts type
of scenario? I think triple
aces by far like I I think
all well I was going to say rolled in in

[2:51:45]
all well I was going to say rolled in in
stud if you have three cards that the
trips to start with you call them rolled
rolled up. So that was what I we were
calling them at the time. So yeah, I
think trip trip aces has to be the best
hand.
Uh yeah, three of a suit definitely goes

[2:52:02]
Uh yeah, three of a suit definitely goes
up in value a lot, but it still
matters. Funnily enough, I actually bust
that tournament with three cards ace
high suit versus my friends. Three cards
with an ace high suit in a different

[2:52:15]
with an ace high suit in a different
suit. I made an ace high flush. He made
a better ace high flush of a different
suit. So like that's how you think. Wow.
That game is
Yeah. So, yeah. So, you can both make a
different flush. It's like, I have a
flush. Yeah, I have a flush as well, but

[2:52:31]
flush. Yeah, I have a flush as well, but
the other two suits that are out there.
Exactly. Yeah. So, I I think it's
actually like Well, let's hope it gets
popularized. It was fun.
It was really fun to play and like even
the the hold guys that you know it was
like a $400 side event or something that

[2:52:46]
like a $400 side event or something that
they, you know, we could bust whatever
2K High Rollola was running on that day
and then like jumped into this and they
all said they absolutely should run this
like every night of the EP. They should
just have like a Turbo 500 or 1K

[2:53:00]
just have like a Turbo 500 or 1K
Superhog. Everyone would love it and
like genuinely I hope it gets introduced
as like a really fun game. Yeah.
Adam, any experience playing Super
Holdem?
No, but you guys have sold it very well.

[2:53:16]
No, but you guys have sold it very well.
I'm excited to uh to play to reel some
reel some friends into it to uh see how
long it takes them to figure it out. No,
it seems seem like a nice hybrid format
for for Ur and yeah, Benny, you've
played a lot of games, so I'm sure
you've played like similar games. But

[2:53:30]
you've played like similar games. But
yeah, it seems like a lot of fun. I
think anything that kind of levels the
playing field, drives a bit of action,
takes a little bit of figuring out, but
also yeah, there's a lot of strategy in
there as well. Seems like a a fun game.
So, yeah, interested to see how it
unfolds. All right, I want to take the
conversation a little bit into a

[2:53:46]
conversation a little bit into a
different direction and I want to do a
little rapid fire. So, rapid fire is
just going to ask you questions that
will be generally a very short answer
and you just say whatever first comes to
mind. All right. So, first question.
What is your most memorable bracelet

[2:54:00]
What is your most memorable bracelet
win?
Has to be my first, I think. Yeah. Just
the most special. Yeah.
What is the scoop or W coup win that
you've had that was the most
underwhelming? Just

[2:54:16]
underwhelming? Just
underwhelming. Um, it had to be one of
the lower ones where
um, it's probably in the middle of a of
a grind of a series where like I'd won a

[2:54:33]
$22 limit event. I'm trying to think.
Uh, where I'd
won like 9K. I I can't think of what the
event was. It was something like a $22

[2:54:46]
event was. It was something like a $22
where I I think I got first for like
between like 7 8K and it didn't get me
even for the day. Like I was still down
on the day and I was still annoyed even
though I'd won an event. I was like this
is not how winning an event should feel.
Yeah.

[2:55:01]
Yeah.
Feel exhausted at the end of a grind. Oh
my god. Didn't even get back. Yeah.
Who's the strongest mixed game player in
your opinion
of I don't know if
there's necessarily one in particular

[2:55:17]
there's necessarily one in particular
um but one of
the top ones I'd say probably Matt
Ashton this going to be a hard one for
you to answer because there's so many
formats but what is the most overrated

[2:55:32]
formats but what is the most overrated
poker concept for
O okay concept when you say concept in
terms of what
could be blockers it could be
rain I don't know any anything that

[2:55:45]
rain I don't know any anything that
comes to mind
um
h okay I I'll say one that's dulging a
bit I'd say in limit games keeping your

[2:56:00]
bit I'd say in limit games keeping your
range
together can be important but is
overrated in terms of how much it
actually matters because it's still a
limit game and it just doesn't matter
enough where you want to not be

[2:56:15]
enough where you want to not be
transparent but people can't actually
punish you
enough because of the limited nature.
So, it's still better than folding to
just be like transparent where you can't
get uh punished for it as much in limit

[2:56:32]
get uh punished for it as much in limit
even though people rarely do that.
Good answer. No limit
hold or D7. Which of those games teaches
you the most about life?

[2:56:46]
you the most about life?
I don't really know. Which have you
learned the most from? I guess
I I feel like it has to be no limit
holder,
but it's for various reasons that

[2:57:01]
but it's for various reasons that
probably not from like the game itself,
but like probably how I've learned the
game. I would
say like single draw probably has more
room for creativity that it's cool if
you want to think outside the box but

[2:57:18]
you want to think outside the box but
well I
mean not hold them these days I'm
finding a bit more robot robotic as I
said for me memorization so it's less
teaching about life but the way that I
learned the games where I've learned

[2:57:32]
learned the games where I've learned
what variance is through no limit hold
them tournaments you
I'm understanding more about variance.
resultsorientatedness from no limit like
very clearly throughout my like these

[2:57:46]
very clearly throughout my like these
kind of things. Trying to be more
logically minded. Trying to disregard
results in various ways all things that
are probably
quite easily illustrated in No Limit.
And there's just like such a depth and

[2:58:01]
And there's just like such a depth and
variety to them that there's a lot of
capabilities to it. Yeah.
What's the strangest thing you've
witnessed at a pocket table? My
goodness.

[2:58:16]
Could be an outfit. Someone bringing a
monkey. I always see guys in body with
snakes around the necks. I'm like, what
the hell's going on here? An outfit. I
don't know. There's so many things like
such a list. I don't know if I could

[2:58:31]
such a list. I don't know if I could
distill one. Outfits. I've played it in
uh full bear costume
twice like
with claws.
Uh

[2:58:45]
Uh
I I
I think it's it would probably be
something outlandish like people
really tilting in certain ways. I I
think it was adjacent to me at the World

[2:59:00]
think it was adjacent to me at the World
Series where it was the year where a guy
had
like taken off some of his clothes and
uh also I think that same guy like threw
a shoe his shoe at the dealer. I don't

[2:59:15]
a shoe his shoe at the dealer. I don't
think I saw that but I was witness to a
lot of that.
Um, oh god, even that, well, that's kind
of a a tragic answer, but probably the
most crazy thing was uh witnessing the

[2:59:31]
most crazy thing was uh witnessing the
uh panic of the what we thought was um
shooter in Vegas, the
stampede. That was probably the craziest
thing. And just while I I was just
sitting there playing in in hand and
everybody's absolutely losing their

[2:59:46]
everybody's absolutely losing their
mind. I think that has to probably take
the cake.
[Music]
It's funny. The last time I asked that
question, it was the same answer. So,
it's a small poker world. A lot of guys
in that room. Yeah, I remember. If poker

[3:00:01]
in that room. Yeah, I remember. If poker
disappeared tomorrow, what would you do?
Poker disappeared tomorrow. It would
definitely be something to do with music
where I would well

[3:00:17]
where I would well
actually you know what that cuz that
depends a lot on where I live. I would
probably go live somewhere that I really
like actually wanted to live and didn't
depend on like my poker travels for it

[3:00:32]
depend on like my poker travels for it
and poker regulations like didn't depend
on how much of a travel hub it is.
Didn't depend on time zone for scoops,
things like that. So, I'd want to live
somewhere that's going to have a nice
climate and I would just probably move

[3:00:47]
climate and I would just probably move
there and then I would actually have a
fixed place where I'm able to do things
in music that I would like where it's be
a guitar teacher, form a band, be work
in a studio, like these kind of things
I'd love to devote my time to in a nice

[3:01:01]
I'd love to devote my time to in a nice
comfortable environment.
Amazing. Anywhere come to mind?
I I don't know. Um there there are
places in Europe that I would but

[3:01:16]
places in Europe that I would but
because I haven't entertained them now
because of either like regulations or
time zone,
but weather is an
issue. So, um I would either like still
maybe travel during the winter.

[3:01:31]
maybe travel during the winter.
uh depends if I want to live
somewhere just during the summer or not.
So, I mean, there are so many places in
Europe that I would like to live cuz I
think are just great standards of
living. like Denmark or somewhere just

[3:01:47]
living. like Denmark or somewhere just
has a great standard of living, but
there's just too much grayness and rain
that it might be somewhere like uh
Portugal
or might be somewhere a bit more exotic

[3:02:00]
or might be somewhere a bit more exotic
that I would try like Costa Rica that
I've never tried to but would want to
look there
or get. There are certain places I would
like even like Bali for example is a
beautiful place or somewhere in Asia.

[3:02:15]
beautiful place or somewhere in Asia.
Yeah. I've been here 10 years now. It's
a nice place to be. But I think for you
feels like at some point you'll explore
where you want to go without the poker
restrictions, let's call it, or the
poker practicalities. And yeah, from

[3:02:30]
poker practicalities. And yeah, from
there, as you mentioned, the world will
open up in terms of where you can spend
your time. All right. Well, you passed
the rapid fire. We're going to now move
into some reflecting questions and just
looking back on some of the things
you've learned through your your long
career. So the first one is what is the

[3:02:45]
career. So the first one is what is the
most important lesson poker has taught
you that transfers into your everyday
life? These are really tough to just get
one thing out. I mean these are like
really just so many things. I don't know
how to kind of nar give us more. Yeah,
multiple is fine. One main thing is

[3:03:00]
multiple is fine. One main thing is
hopefully my decision
making and also probably just overall
the kind
of logical rational mind.
So generally trying to

[3:03:17]
So generally trying to
be as logical and rational as I can in a
lot of scenarios. Um,
and cocoa I would like to think has
helped with that in terms of things like

[3:03:31]
helped with that in terms of things like
you know you're trying to only focus on
the things that are within your control
trying to not focus on things outside of
your control. Trying to ignore that and
sort of consider that as noise or
whatever things that don't matter. So

[3:03:47]
whatever things that don't matter. So
trying to focus only on the decisions
that you can make and not necessarily on
the results if you couldn't have
predicted something. So trying

[3:04:00]
to make the decisions with the best
results that you had at the time and
then because of that be at peace with
that or I think I misqued that with the
best information that you had at the
time and then because of that how it was

[3:04:17]
time and then because of that how it was
at the time then sort of being at peace
with the results for whatever happens
and if you couldn't have predicted the
results but they did go end up badly
then trying to be at peace with that
because that was all you could do.

[3:04:31]
I like it. It's like rational plus
decisions and accepting probabilities to
some degree. Yeah. All right. What is
your definition of success or how has
your definition of success changed as
you've had more success in poker?

[3:04:49]
And do you mean in poker or just
generally in like
Generally though, I think poker might
cloud it, but I'm interested to see what

[3:05:00]
cloud it, but I'm interested to see what
comes to mind. Yeah. Yeah. I I was
largely think as a pocus perspective.
And that's kind of difficult cuz like
the main it's like metrics in poker
where it's either kind of how much money
you've made or

[3:05:16]
you've made or
your ability like your your relative
ability are probably the two main things
where different people value those
differently. That's subjective. Like
some people think you're the best poker

[3:05:31]
some people think you're the best poker
player because you've you've made the
money, you get into the best games,
whatever it is. Other people think
you're the best because you're the best
in terms of ability. So I think
that's subjective.

[3:05:46]
that's subjective.
Uh I think having a healthy balance of
those is good.
It's I should have probably strive more
for my career in terms of pro uh
profitability. That was probably
actually one thing I was going to say to

[3:06:01]
actually one thing I was going to say to
Rene's question earlier that I should
have done that more and try to get into
sketchier games or whatever like these
kind of things that I think were going
to be much more profitable for me and

[3:06:15]
to be much more profitable for me and
taking more risks in that regard rather
than just only trying to be better in
terms of ability. And I think like that
definitely would have made me more
money. And like if I would have traveled
to private games or if I would have just
moved to Vegas like 10 years ago, I'm

[3:06:31]
moved to Vegas like 10 years ago, I'm
sure that would have made me more money
if I would have just wanted to grind the
cash games there for example for a long
time, but wouldn't have made me so
happy. So you can even measure like
happiness as a metric for success too.

[3:06:46]
happiness as a metric for success too.
It all kind of balance in life.
So I probably would think that it's some
kind
of struggling of in between. I think
it's happiness

[3:07:00]
it's happiness
is one
of the main measurements of success
honestly.
Yeah. And like if something you've
achieved has like helped you be Yeah.
Yeah. It's interesting. It's almost like
the like a few components that go

[3:07:16]
the like a few components that go
together. Obviously a there's a striving
to achieve things. Generally we think
success is like achievement and we link
that very closely. But as soon as we
start having success we realize ah
that's that can't be it because like
I've got to feel good. I've got to be
happy on that pursuit. So then you start
to balance it with do I feel happy? Am I

[3:07:30]
to balance it with do I feel happy? Am I
achieving stuff? Am I growing? Do I feel
connected to the life I'm living and
there's like an interplay between like
the achievements you're seeking and the
happiness that you're you're living
underneath that. So yeah, I think it's I
always like to ask that question because
I feel like it's it unlocks like in your
own mind like what you're thinking
through of what you're trying to achieve

[3:07:46]
through of what you're trying to achieve
because that's that's kind of the the
nature of poker players trying to
achieve success, but then you're trying
to balance that with a a successful life
in terms of a happy life. So yeah, I
like that you came full circle and I
think I like was it was a rounded
answer. So I was going to say people's
goalposts move all the time for what
they want to achieve and what they might

[3:08:01]
they want to achieve and what they might
deem successful. like they might have
achieved something and then still want
to achieve the next thing after they've
done that already and realize like that
didn't make them happy or they didn't
quantify that as success but they want
the next thing or like they're not

[3:08:15]
the next thing or like they're not
successful enough like these kind of
things. So it's important to be able to
recognize that how it shifts and when
that changes then happiness is probably
the kind of most important thing. Yeah.

[3:08:31]
the kind of most important thing. Yeah.
Yeah, I think as well with that it's
understanding like the games we play and
when that game kind of fulfills its
need. Let's say the money game or
achievement game. There's a certain
point where the threshold you get to
gives you like most of the benefit. But
if you just keep playing that game for
more more more more there comes a point

[3:08:47]
more more more more there comes a point
where it's like okay well the game
showed you more is not going to do it
from the million to 10 million to 100
million probably isn't going to change
your life too much once your life's at a
certain point. So I think just being
understanding of the games you're
playing at certain periods and then

[3:09:00]
playing at certain periods and then
reflecting and go right right now based
on where I am what's the next game I
want to play out to that could seek and
overall I think happiness will be the
end route we end up at even though if we
don't we're coming from a different
angle I think if you're happy you live a
good life you've got a good family good
friends you feel every day you wake up
with a smile on your face it's very hard

[3:09:16]
with a smile on your face it's very hard
to argue that's not a successful life so
yeah even if you might have to tick a
few achievement boxes along the way I
think yeah coming to a happy place is
always going to be the end result
hopefully. All right. In your career,
which is which part of your career has
been the most enjoyable? You've had many

[3:09:31]
been the most enjoyable? You've had many
phases. You've played many formats live
online. Which part of your career did
you enjoy the most? Let's say I think it
was
probably from around the years of like
2016 onwards.

[3:09:46]
2016 onwards.
um for that probably a couple of years
where I was still feeling like decent
hunger and motivation for the game.
And that was kind of the year that I
like really kind of burst onto the scene

[3:10:01]
like really kind of burst onto the scene
a bit more fully established when I won
the two bracelets back to back. And then
it like really felt like that was
special like I've achieved something. I
kind
of belong here. I'm able to be in the
World Series. I played like my first 50k

[3:10:17]
World Series. I played like my first 50k
PPC that year. Like that's like really
exciting. It was still kind of fresh and
new enough where it's exciting. I'm
still like feeling motivated to do these
things because I'm like seeing this
progression. The kind of atmosphere

[3:10:30]
progression. The kind of atmosphere
around me is fun where uh you know
people are even like hyping me up or
being you know friendly like these kind
of things where it was just a really
cool environment and yeah I think that
carried on for some time. I think that

[3:10:45]
carried on for some time. I think that
was probably the most exciting and where
I felt like my ability and confidence
was very high at that time as well. So,
what motivates you to keep playing
poker? You've won the five bracelets.
You've got 20 plus scoop and W coup

[3:11:01]
You've got 20 plus scoop and W coup
trophies lying around. What drives you
still to keep putting the hours to
poker?
Yeah,
it's kind of a tough question for me
because I don't necessarily feel as
motivated as I used to.

[3:11:16]
motivated as I used to.
I wish I did, but yeah, the past
couple years, few years I haven't as
much as I'd like to.
Um, but these days I still enjoy aspects

[3:11:32]
Um, but these days I still enjoy aspects
of it like the competition.
I still enjoy kind
of testing my ability potentially still
being one of the best or seeing if I can
still be one of the best in certain

[3:11:45]
still be one of the best in certain
games in certain aspects and like the
achievements of it. I think I still
enjoy that like enjoy the kind
of exciting final table runs in the
tournament like these kind of things. uh

[3:12:01]
tournament like these kind of things. uh
you know those kind of exciting
atmospheres and even like the sort
of recognition still as well is honestly
a thing for me in terms of kind of

[3:12:15]
a thing for me in terms of kind of
validation from success is nice. Um I
don't seek that as much as I used to.
That used to be one of my kind of
driving factors as well as as for like
trying to really be uh one of the best

[3:12:31]
trying to really be uh one of the best
for recognition and for people's
opinions as well. That used to matter to
me more than I more than it does now.
Now I try and not let poker tournaments
rely on that so much and affect that so

[3:12:48]
rely on that so much and affect that so
much.
But overall, I think it still has like
those aspects that I
enjoy still around that

[3:13:02]
enjoy still around that
where whilst I'm still sort
of near the top of the game in that kind
of aspect around that until I, you know,
I'm going to get in my old age, it's

[3:13:15]
I'm going to get in my old age, it's
still kind of exciting to have those
aspects around it. We've had a long
conversation today about mixed formats,
your journey through poker. What would
you like the listeners to take away from
our conversation today? Yeah. Wow. I
hope a lot of things that they'll be

[3:13:30]
hope a lot of things that they'll be
able to take away both
uh some mixed games rules and strategies
and hopefully uh an encouragement to
play some mixed games and try them out
if they're uh new to them. Uh, as I

[3:13:47]
if they're uh new to them. Uh, as I
said, I'd always encourage everybody to
try them, both for fun and variety and
for hopefully uh expanding their poker
brain and way of thinking. Uh, I would

[3:14:01]
brain and way of thinking. Uh, I would
also hope that
um there are some kind of mental gain
things that they would be able to take
away on kind of potentially the more
serious side of whether

[3:14:16]
serious side of whether
it's being able to
accept things within yourself to be at
peace with. that would hopefully make
your poker play
uh more pleasant and cause you less

[3:14:32]
uh more pleasant and cause you less
suffering both during and after as well.
And as well as things like hopefully how
to play a scoop series and prepare for
that, these kind of things. Hopefully

[3:14:46]
that, these kind of things. Hopefully
there was some decent nuggets of advice
in there. Um, but really I I think some
of them the mental game type things are
probably more most important. Like a lot
of those took me a long time to learn.

[3:15:01]
of those took me a long time to learn.
So hopefully I've been able to pass on
some good things there that I wish I had
known earlier in my career. Well, thank
you for spending the last three hours
with us. You've definitely opened up our
eyes to mixed game formats and as you

[3:15:16]
eyes to mixed game formats and as you
mentioned shared a lot of valuable
lessons that you've learned over your
career. So, thank you so much for your
time and we appreciate you spending with
us.
Glad to hear it. Thanks for having me
on, guys. Take care. Thanks for
watching. What a great conversation that
was with Benny. Adam, main takeaways

[3:15:32]
was with Benny. Adam, main takeaways
from today's conversation. Yeah, we
touched on a lot of topics. One of the
ones I enjoyed was around the series
grinds. Benny's a bit of a legend of
grinding the scoops and the W coops. So,
I want to dive into his preparation, his

[3:15:45]
I want to dive into his preparation, his
advice for the tournament grinds. And it
very quickly became obvious how much he
approaches everything around
environment, routine very seriously.
When he does a series, his whole life is
basically a trade-off in terms of is it
going to help performance. He moves to

[3:16:01]
going to help performance. He moves to
Vancouver. He's on the same routine.
He's always he talk about his evening
routines. He talked about unwinding
during breaks. So I think for anyone
listening although his advice as he
mentioned was tailored to himself but
all the questions he was asking about

[3:16:15]
all the questions he was asking about
solving preparation solving lifestyle
solving environments are very
applicable. So I think anyone who's got
a series grinds coming up or are looking
to do them if you want to do it
professionally or do it to a high level
you got to really take performance and
lifestyle very seriously. So I think
Benny was a good example of how to do

[3:16:31]
Benny was a good example of how to do
that. I like the conversation we talked
about overwhelm and especially in final
table scenarios. We did a a good deep
dive into that and we kind of narrowed
it down into expectations. As a
tournament grinder, I work with a lot of
tournament players myself on mindsets
and very often expectations are a real

[3:16:47]
and very often expectations are a real
big hurdle. For most grinds, it's not as
monumental the big scores, but in
tournaments, you've got this pay
structure that just rise and rises. Come
to the final table, there could be
life-changing money on the line. So,
it's very hard sometimes to not let the

[3:17:00]
it's very hard sometimes to not let the
minds get attached to that narrative.
But we talked about being okay with
things not going your way, accepting
things more. And then we also talked
about judgment in terms of external
pressures. He mentioned for himself
overwhelm generally kicks in when he's
thinking about other people's opinions

[3:17:15]
thinking about other people's opinions
of him, wanting to look good, not make
mistakes. He mentioned even post on
social media that he's made a final
table and how that became a negative
because now he's got pressures and
standards up to hold up to. So I think
we did a good deep dive into the
experience of being a poker player
trying to get good results but also
trying to play your best and the

[3:17:31]
trying to play your best and the
challenge of that in a in a high stakes
environment. So yeah, I really liked his
way of breaking that down. I think he
was well re put some good examples of
how to work past those kind of
understand the triggers, understand the
responses and do that kind of work in
advance to reprogram that kind of
response so that you feel more

[3:17:46]
response so that you feel more
comfortable. Then he mentioned for
himself is the most beneficial thing is
experience and getting a lot of reps in.
So although that isn't the advice to a
up and cominging player, he did mention
that for him being in that situation
more frequently, being comfortable
playing those final tables after many

[3:18:00]
playing those final tables after many
many years has allowed him over time to
feel less pressure, less overwhelm.
Yeah, I think we did a a good deep dive
there. How about yourself Rene? What the
main takeaway is for you? I wrote down
don't be afraid to look like an idiot. I
think this was advice that he got from

[3:18:15]
think this was advice that he got from
from a buddy of him and it it was around
uh the we talked around experimenting
with strategy right and thinking out of
the box and what he couldn't really
point he didn't he gave a couple of

[3:18:30]
point he didn't he gave a couple of
examples but what happened there mo most
was just thinking about the
opportunities right it opened up his
mind so yeah experiment with different
strategies over apply and then
recalibrate to see what worked and get
that feedback, right? Don't just
stubbornly stick to that strategy. No,

[3:18:46]
stubbornly stick to that strategy. No,
you're you're trying to get feedback.
Um, we talked a lot obviously about
mixed games. I wrote down a couple of
things in limit games. It was very
important to get the blinds out, right?
That's what he said. For example, on the
button, you just only three bet, for
example, just to get the blinds up

[3:19:01]
example, just to get the blinds up
because, you know, you can often end up
chopping. Uh, so then it's better to
chop up the blinds with just two people
instead of with three or four. Uh at PLO
we talked about the fact that you know
you need a stronger absolute hand

[3:19:15]
you need a stronger absolute hand
because you know you now have four cards
equities run closer together. Uh he also
talked about the fact that you don't
really randomize in PLO. He said because
you have four cards so you have more
information about the deck. So often
your hand is being enforced by the other

[3:19:30]
your hand is being enforced by the other
two side cards and how they interact
with the board if you have good blockers
on blockers back whatever. Um then we
went to the high low format and there it
was very important to know what your
objective was if you were likely going
to win on chop. So with the low for

[3:19:46]
to win on chop. So with the low for
example you said you want to get as much
people in the pot and chop up that money
so there's more to chop up or you want
to bluff people off the chop uh or
obviously you want to scoop it but yeah
to scoop it you need both hands which is
a bit harder to do but that was the main
strategic involvement. He we also talked

[3:20:00]
strategic involvement. He we also talked
a little bit more about other games, but
we got to Dus 7 triple draw and that's
where he said that's the game where
talent shines through the most. So if
you if you would want to measure no
limit hold players purely on raw talent,
put them in that game without any prior

[3:20:16]
put them in that game without any prior
knowledge and see who who's able to
figure it out the fastest. We then also
talked about super hold. Great game.
Three whole cards. He mention he played
in Kabalia. I mention I played in a home
game with France. Great game. do watch
out for uh uh for four of a kind because

[3:20:31]
out for uh uh for four of a kind because
this didn't possible on any flop, right?
So yeah, in general, I think we we
chatted about a lot of things. He gave a
lot of great advice. Definitely you
learned a lot to learn from.
Um thank you guys. You made it all the

[3:20:45]
