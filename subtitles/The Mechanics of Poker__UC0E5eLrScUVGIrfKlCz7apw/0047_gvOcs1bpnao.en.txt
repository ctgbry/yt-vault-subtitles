[00:00]
so i decided to throw this hand into a
big bat which
i think is fine um gonna have maybe
already a better big on the turn
but as played i think the river is fine
and now it's that time where you just
cross your fingers and pray the guy
folds

[00:17]
folds

do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free

[00:30]
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo hi there my fellow poker
players and welcome back to another
video here at the poker ambitious
channel
in which today i'll be educating you
guys on flop
check raising a very important part of
the poker
tree now as always if you like this

[00:47]
tree now as always if you like this
video make sure
to give it a thumbs up and leave a
comment down below and without further
ado
let's get into some handy series where
we've check raised the flop
so the first hand we are in the small
one with 76 suited decided to choose a

[01:01]
one with 76 suited decided to choose a
variety of check race spots so i'm sure
everything
will be in there and here we actually
overcall the recreational calls in the
cutoff
we flop bottom pair and we face seabed
by the initial razor and venom folds and

[01:16]
by the initial razor and venom folds and
now we have a decision
now obviously this team is this video's
team's flop check raising so
you guys already kind of know what we're
gonna do we're actually going to check
raise the
flop and i think this is a very
interesting
type of flop check race usually what you

[01:31]
type of flop check race usually what you
can see
in these kind of spots it's okay to use
like bottom type of
paris as a bluff as it has
it's kind of a bluff with good equity
let's say for example if we have a hand
like king jack
which you could maybe also check race

[01:45]
which you could maybe also check race
the problem with king jack is
yes it has some equity uh but it's also
blocking
finland's faults right a hand that
vietnam could be folding uh on the flop
like i had like ace jack or king nine
or maybe if he calls that full set on
the turn um

[02:01]
the turn um
and seven six at least you know we're
blocking a set which is good
uh we have some backup equity with the
hearts like a few
two seven six of spades or seven six of
diamonds that would be
being a little bit loose but don't
really mind my player i also don't

[02:16]
really mind my player i also don't
really think we have to be afraid to get
three bet on the flop all that often
as our range is perceived quite
polarized i think we have sevens
and queen tenths suited basically or
like a combo draw
so i as you just heard

[02:31]
so i as you just heard
we don't have a lot of value combos so i
don't think we should go overboard but i
think seven six a heart is a fine
combination
and it goes turn is a deuce we don't
really improve
but i think it's a very important spot
to keep on firing
which we do we fire a nice little

[02:46]
which we do we fire a nice little
three-quarters
barrel we don't have to go too big to
set up stacks as it was already three
red pots
we check raised to 100 so i think the
sizing is fine
and we're kind of in the same scenario
right we're kind of wrapping uh
our queen 10 suited our pocket sevens

[03:00]
our queen 10 suited our pocket sevens
and maybe like a couple of very good
draws
the good thing i think about this
turnplay is that let's say if he did
see that a middle type of pair like a
10x
he will be now in a lot of trouble i
think if he has a better hand
like queens or tents he's quite likely

[03:16]
like queens or tents he's quite likely
actually to check the flop with the
recreational behind
so i think it's most likely holding is
going to be a draw
or like a top pair type of hand which
if you look at our range let's say for
example

[03:30]
example
obviously version 7's he's quite dead
first the combo draw he still has to
dodge
um and obviously our hand still has
equity so he's not in a very happy spot
i also don't think
getting check raised from the small
blind three-way in these kind of
positions
is a spot that naturally gets over

[03:45]
is a spot that naturally gets over
bluffed um
fitting calls so i think on this point
an attorney something's going to fold a
better hand he's actually something
that's going to call it worse i think
draws mainly like king jack uh club
draws i think they're
very inclined to call again so i
actually think we still have the best

[04:01]
actually think we still have the best
hand sometimes
so this is a very big benefit of check
raising this type of holdings
on the river it's up to us and i
don't think we it's quite close and it
kind of depends on what he does with his

[04:15]
kind of depends on what he does with his
10x on the flop and on the turn
if he decides to bat call a little bit
more of these type of hands like ace
tank king 10
then i think jamming the river is
plausible uh however i think we do have
some shot of value versus for example i
had like ace king
or i had like ace jack of clubs so i

[04:30]
or i had like ace jack of clubs so i
actually elected to
check and reevaluate i think if he jams
it's quite an interesting spot
as it's not really a spot where i think
people will go very thin for
value as our range is perceived to be
quite polarized so let's say for example
you do have a head like ace queen here
what are you trying to get value from

[04:46]
what are you trying to get value from
don't really see a lot of hands that can
play this way that can now call the
river
basically i have the exact hand versus
which you then could be value betting
if you didn't thought about it for a
little while he actually checked behind
with king check
which is actually a great result for us

[05:00]
which is actually a great result for us
uh let's say for example he if he would
decide to bluff his hands uh a lot of
the time that's already like eight
combinations if you look at
his value i think it would be kings and
aces mainly
so i think actually hero calling the
river here is actually a fine play

[05:15]
river here is actually a fine play
but hey we didn't need to invest in
another 655
and we scoop a nice little pot
the next hand we have six three suited
call from the big blind
and we face the seabed here on the king

[05:31]
and we face the seabed here on the king
queen six and we actually decided to
check race
this is actually a concept that comes
into play when ranges get a little bit
tighter
especially for epmp these are also
boards that you don't really have
a lot of

[05:45]
a lot of
potential draws that aren't uh able to
call
so let's say for example of course we
have a lot of potential draws as intend
jack ace jack ace 10
but they're also quite fine check calls
right um
a good check race candidate here could
maybe be a hand like
eight diamonds seven of uh

[06:03]
eight diamonds seven of uh
of clubs for example but we're not
really defending that that often in
these positions
so therefore you don't really have that
classic overcard with some backdoor
potential type of draws
and then usually these kind of hints can
hands can come in the mix

[06:16]
hands can come in the mix
um to keep your check race frequency up
so i decided to check race as you can
see sizing is a little bit bigger as
we're
representing a bit more of a polarized
range maybe two pairs
maybe have like king jack with a diamond
king 10 where the diamonds are

[06:30]
king 10 where the diamonds are
plausible candidates fitting calls and
here we kind of have the same benefit
rightly sometimes not bad folding i have
like rocket sevens pocket eights
he's sometimes bad calling with a draw
so this is usually the
the upside of check raising kind of
these mergy type of candidates

[06:46]
these mergy type of candidates
interesting turn now if the turn would
have been a club
the three of clubs i think barreling is
definitely the most possibly play
if the turn is a hard it's quite close
we could either check race or barrel
but i think i'm a diamond the best
player is to check

[07:01]
player is to check
there's just going to be a lot of bad
rivers for us
and i think going back to bat i mean on
the blank yes it's fine but
if you consider what are really blanks
basically a nine or higher isn't really
a blank
a diamond isn't really blank so that's

[07:15]
a diamond isn't really blank so that's
kind of the half the deck so looking
ahead i think
this is not really a great spot to
already throw a lot of money in the pot
i think we just want to dodge one card
and if we check let's say for example he
hasn't had like 10 nine hearts or
something
that's a hat that he can now start
bluffing

[07:30]
bluffing
that if you that would fall so i think
checking for those reasons becomes
superior so we're obviously check
calling
versus an eighth so we're going to check
check and i think now
uh our hand should just focus on trying
to get some value we touched the river
which we wanted

[07:45]
which we wanted
so i would like to see it's not that big
it's less likely that he has a bluff
as he would have either folded his bluff
after her decorates or better that on
the turn let's say he had a hand like
tan jack
so i think he's most likely holding here
is just for the same reason we're
both controlling the tournament six

[08:00]
both controlling the tournament six
three i think he could also still be
both controlling the turn with
uh one pair of hands so i think we
should now just get value from that
so i'd go for three-quarter sizing i
think we could even go bigger
don't wouldn't have mind for example on
over bat as i think he can easily have

[08:15]
over bat as i think he can easily have
hands like ace king for example
and unfolds
ace deuce defend the big blind little
bit of a loser defend but we're playing
higher stakes three-handed so the rake
is reduced

[08:30]
is reduced
and again we have a bottom pair type of
holding here which we decided to check
race uh
actually we're now playing versus the
button this becomes a little bit of a
loose-ish check race i would say as we
just have
very uh a lot of other potential
candidates so i think this is definitely

[08:45]
candidates so i think this is definitely
an overplayed
concept uh because for example here we
do have if you have ace dudes off we
also have ace four off with a diamond
for example
that would already be a way better
candidate uh not necessarily that the
evf check raising is higher
but we can also check call acedos and we

[09:01]
but we can also check call acedos and we
cannot really check call h4 or this the
evf check calling is less so therefore
check raising
i think is a plausible strategy getting
calls
turn is a nine very bad card we didn't
really improve
a lot of hands improved so i think we

[09:16]
a lot of hands improved so i think we
now just want to be checking
and probably just check folding then
checks behind
okay this is quite interesting
everywhere is the jack and it brings a
diamond
and i actually decided to go for a
little bluff here on the river

[09:30]
little bluff here on the river
uh i think it's hard to show up with a
lot of bloss like i said i already think
actually this is kind of an overplay
let's say for example we had ace deuce
with the ace of diamonds i think
then it's already a little bit better
then i think we should always bet the
turn in order to jam these type of

[09:46]
turn in order to jam these type of
rivers
now we do have to be careful though as
we're clearly made uh
made a little bit of an overplay here
with the ace deuce
um but i think the river is just very
hard for us to show up with bluffs
and if he just has a random one pair

[10:01]
and if he just has a random one pair
hand like a 10x or a king axe
or maybe even the same hand ace deuce i
think he
he has quite a tough time um finding a
call here
and i think we're quite plausible
representing um

[10:15]
representing um
maybe hands like king queen king jack
these type of holdings
for the goals she had a skin even at the
ace of diamonds could even consider
a race
yeah i mean nice end by him

[10:32]
yeah i mean nice end by him
h4 this is kind of
uh what i was talking about so let's say
we had ace deuce here
now we are in the playing against the
cutoff we probably won't defend ace
deuce

[10:45]
deuce
but then this was kind of the better
candidate that i just discussed
the back door straight with the back
door with an over and a back of flush
draw
usually in terms of type of hands that
you want to be check raising with these
are kind of the characteristics of a
hand
that you should be looking out for and

[11:00]
that you should be looking out for and
obviously the more you have them
so for example you're playing in a big
button spot for example you have a lot
of offset combinations so if you have a
lot of draws and these type of foldings
then usually all these hands become
frequencies and then when we go towards
tighter positions
you will have them less often so if you

[11:15]
you will have them less often so if you
do have a good candidate you can usually
check raise them at a higher frequency
okay so over back door i think it all
looks good fitting calls
turn is a four we do have the ace of
hearts and we're quite deep
i don't actually mind seeing us barrel

[11:30]
i don't actually mind seeing us barrel
this hand uh with the ace of hearts i
think
then if the river rolls off and hard i
think we're in quite a good
spot and we do actually see that we even
we're even setting up stacks we're
representing white uh we're basically
saying that we have
ace queen plus i would say um

[11:47]
ace queen plus i would say um
that's kind of the range that we're
representing and
there isn't enough connectivity in the
board for us to
maybe consider a different sizing so i
definitely like the sizing i think the
story that we're telling is quite good

[12:00]
story that we're telling is quite good
we could sometimes still get called by
worse but i don't think
that applies here all that often so now
basically the plan is
river uh river heart and bluff i don't
think this hand will ever bluff the
river
unimproved as we're blocking a lot of it

[12:15]
unimproved as we're blocking a lot of it
at fault with the ace of hearts right
so winning calls river and ace
quite a good river we do have the ace of
hearts so
basically let's say we would have had
another a2s but we

[12:30]
another a2s but we
would have had the deuce of hearts with
the asic clubs or something
i think jamming the river is definitely
good because he will have all the a6
hearts that he's calling colin calling
now though
we have the ace of hearts so there's a
little bit less hands we're going to

[12:45]
little bit less hands we're going to
to call us with um i actually decided to
check
it's a little bit of funk play
basically there's quite a lot of hands
that now
want to give up i guess let's say for
example i had and the king jack of
hearts is a very bad type of bluffing

[13:01]
hearts is a very bad type of bluffing
candidate
so i think if i would be bluffing here
it would probably be with a hand that
kind of blocks something so let's say i
had deuce three of hearts or something
or lose five of hearts
i think that would be a fine bluff but i
think and like king jack or ten jack or
king ten

[13:15]
king ten
they're quite poor bluffs on the river
if we have a heart with it
and i think a lot if we now jam
basically we need to get hero called by
hands that block bluffs so let's say he
has king queen
let's say he's queen jack these are kind
of the hands that didn't then should be

[13:30]
of the hands that didn't then should be
hero calling which
i don't think will happen all that often
whereas if we check i do think he can
be bluffing miss flush draws he could
blow fanta king jack then jack
so i thought in game that there was more
hands that could bluff us
so therefore i decided to check when he

[13:45]
so therefore i decided to check when he
checks behind 910 i think this hand for
example
would probably not call the river
actually could be not sure
kind of also depends on your opponent
right the more your opponent calls hero

[14:00]
right the more your opponent calls hero
calls the river obviously the more we
should jam
the lesser hero across the river the
more i think we should just check and
let him bluff
it's for suited three-bet from the small
blind
everything calls so now we're talking

[14:16]
everything calls so now we're talking
about like more of a check raising spot
as the initial razor
we checked with the ace four of diamonds
which i think
is okay fill in bats and we decided
actually to use our hand as a check race

[14:30]
actually to use our hand as a check race
um not really actually too big a fan of
of this play the problem is the board is
quite dry let's say he has
an a stand suited let's say he has
pocket jacks like some common draw he
can easily just rip it in
and then we have to fold this hand which
is quite a waste let's say we had h4 of

[14:46]
is quite a waste let's say we had h4 of
clubs or something i think the blade is
fine
um but then again then i would maybe
also be a little bit more inclined to
just bet the flop so it is
like the hand that i would maybe prefer
to check race probably doesn't really
play this way so that's kind of a
dilemma

[15:02]
fill in calls and the turn is a 10 i
think this is a
quite a high frequency check spot for us
we check
fill in bats and now we actually went
for the double check race so we have
some flop check races going on some turn

[15:15]
some flop check races going on some turn
check races going on
and basically what we're doing here
we're kind of using our set blocker so
that's like that he has force
basically i think if he has eight he's
obviously going to call and then we're
literally
dead so that's not very good same with
the 10 but we're blocking ace and suited
which i think is a fine hand to have and

[15:32]
which i think is a fine hand to have and
the thing is if he has a bluff right
let's say he has ant like six seven
suited it's two overs and an open ender
same way they had like jack queen suited
so basically this is a spot where his
bluffs will have quite a lot of equity
um and i also think we lack a lot of

[15:46]
um and i also think we lack a lot of
blocks so i also actually think this
line gets quite a lot of credit
um and there's i mean there's already
quite a lot of money in the middle we're
risking like 4k for 4k
so i think our return investment is
quite good but
it's a little bit of a funky hand okay

[16:01]
it's a little bit of a funky hand okay
but yeah i don't necessarily hate the
flop check race obviously the more
villain stabs and the more steps hence
like five
sixes sevens and maybe even nines the
better it gets

[16:21]
ace deuce defend the big blind nice
little gutter
check race it's a fine hand to
double barrel at least because we have

[16:30]
double barrel at least because we have
the ace of spades basically combo wise
if we have the ace of spades
finland will have all the eight acts
with the backdrops that he's at least
going to call the flop
uh and probably fold the term so i like
to check race with the ace of spades i
think that's a good candidate to just
always check race

[16:45]
always check race
and bad turn we turn
something that is on the bottom of our
connectivity so not the greatest
greatest of turns we check
putting checks behind where was the
queen

[17:01]
queen
and we bet the river and i think in
general check race check bats should be
a very big part of your arsenal
when you're check raising especially
from the big blind uh there's quite a
lot of hands that we could be checking
with that check check raising the
flopway that now want to check the turn

[17:15]
flopway that now want to check the turn
because they didn't improve mainly let's
say for example you have queen unsuited
or had like queen tan
maybe even king queen could be ants that
check raised with a certain frequency
i also think a lot of our other bluffs
that we decide to
check right on the flop kind of improve
on the turn so also

[17:30]
on the turn so also
again i think in terms of looking for
blossom our side it's quite hard to show
up with a lot of bluffs
h3 would have just barreled the turn so
i think we're wrapping a queen here
quite valid i would say
maybe even a hand like a jack that wants

[17:46]
maybe even a hand like a jack that wants
to check the turn because the turn
becomes a little bit connected uh don't
necessarily want to blow up the pot
so i think actually we're wrapping quite
a nice hand here
and then unfolds

[18:01]
and then unfolds
queen five suited defend the big blind
flop and draw
decide to go for a check race these kind
of draws are usually quite good if you
look ahead
uh a king a ten and eight is a great
card then we pick up a combo draw
so i like to check raise the queen of

[18:16]
so i like to check raise the queen of
diamonds here
hidden are actually three bets the flop
okay
basically saying listen you only have
threes i think you actually check
nine off how jack then off is probably
in here 2k

[18:30]
in here 2k
it's a little bit loose but yeah
probably in there
that he probably actually doesn't have
so not really sure what the check race
means but we call
turn is now a card that kind of
completes the draws
and we talked about it in some other
tongue betting videos
that i'm gonna now little throw out a

[18:46]
that i'm gonna now little throw out a
little donkey donkey and that's because
basically on the flop he says this and i
have an
advantage in terms of over pair and he
wants to kind of leverage that advantage
by three betting the flop
uh i don't think people threw at a lot
of
draws in position and this is mainly

[19:01]
draws in position and this is mainly
because let's say for example i do
do have a value hand like jack nine or
pocket trees and three bets he gives me
the opportunity to come over the top
and then has to fold this draw right and
in general you don't really want to be
putting your hands in situations where
you're going to bat fold the draw

[19:15]
you're going to bat fold the draw
it's not really a great spot to be in
so i think that in terms of 108 in terms
of flushes i now turn the advantage
leading me to do betting
filling calls we in the river we get
even more diamonds we didn't need all
these diamonds
but hey now that we're here we have to

[19:31]
but hey now that we're here we have to
do something and i think betting again
is probably the
correct strategy i decided to go for a
little bat it's now going to be very
hard for us to have a bluff i think our
bluff
on the turn could have been a hand like
king 10 of spades king queen of spades

[19:45]
king 10 of spades king queen of spades
well they have not reverted top pair you
could make an argument that that
actually is not really a strong hand to
should now still always bluff but i
don't think we have a lot of at least
natural bluffs
so i think sizing down a little bit in
these kind of spots hoping
to get called a little bit lighter is

[20:00]
to get called a little bit lighter is
probably a good idea
about vinyl folds
a3 suited little lint pods oh no another
limb pot with limp coal
filling bats and we check raise the flop

[20:16]
filling bats and we check raise the flop
again kind of an
over background straight draw usually
like you see that with the wheel
um that having a wheel draw is actually
quite valuable the good thing about
having a wheel draw here as well is
let's say we do turn our wheel draw

[20:30]
let's say we do turn our wheel draw
video will have some hands that he is
always following the turn with mainly
810 suited 9 10 suited king 10 suited
type of hands that we're not really
blocking
and if he does have queens kings we
still over over with the ace
and obviously we turn some activity with
the wheel so this is the perfect turn

[20:46]
the wheel so this is the perfect turn
and i think this turnbed will already
get quite a lot of credit
don't want to go too big i think we want
to still be able to bat a hand like ace
jack
so i think our value range here now is
deuces sevens jack 7 suited
ace jack okay and i think ace three

[21:02]
ace jack okay and i think ace three
is a fine hand to add in in his range
so i expect villain to know to have
floated the flop for example with a hand
like king queen
suited or k-10 suited he would have
floated the flop with his gutters that
he's not all gonna fault

[21:15]
he's not all gonna fault
so when he calls i think he is quite
strong
um or he turned like hearts with king
and a heart
or he just has a jack or better
river is now an eighth which doesn't
improve us at all but i do think it can

[21:30]
improve us at all but i do think it can
improve our perceived range
which basically if you look at the more
natural draws
their hands may be like eight ten eight
nine ten nine
um one eight now makes it pair quite a
high pair as well second pair so i think
an eight is
maybe checking now so nine ten got there

[21:46]
maybe checking now so nine ten got there
so i think actually we now have a fine
hand to gem
we're blocking aces we're blocking ace
jack which are
quite absolute strong hands and fitness
range we're unfortunately not blocking
let's say for example we have a deuce
then at least we will be maybe blocking
like pocket deuces

[22:00]
like pocket deuces
um but i think just looking again in
terms of how the board round out
uh our hand which blocks some of his uh
potential calls i think we have a fine
hand to jam
so this is also something for you guys

[22:15]
so this is also something for you guys
to take in consideration right if the
board just blanks out
you have a lot of potential bluffs when
these gutters miss right and as soon as
a card like this comes in
you will have less perceived bluffs like
what do you put people on when they
check raise back
often a lot of draw so usually when

[22:31]
often a lot of draw so usually when
draws then complete
it's good that you have check raise some
hands on the flop that could actually
block when the draw comes in that don't
actually improve
your specific hand so in this case uh
the little wheel asus with a check raise
here on the flop i think are a good
candidate
if the turn is an eight okay then i

[22:46]
if the turn is an eight okay then i
think we should just have shot down with
h3 okay but if the turn is a four
we have the green flag to barrel denver
in the river is eight i think it's a
fine candidate
to jam
villain unfortunately the eighth we

[23:00]
villain unfortunately the eighth we
thought was very good
uh as it were up our bluffing uh as it
were up our fault equity but villain
actually
revert to pair so that's quite bad news
for us
so we face a race here on the button we
call it eight nine
low board we decided to go for a little

[23:16]
low board we decided to go for a little
check race it's a hand
that can get some value needs some
protection
so i think this is a fine play the stack
size is a little bit
near for it uh it's
not considered a good thing let's say

[23:30]
not considered a good thing let's say
he's shorter let's say he only has 10
big blinds 15 big blinds and i think
this is fine
maybe even 20 big blinds if he's very
deep then i think this is fine as well
but when the stacks get a little bit
around this size it's maybe i could
reconsider my play
but you know it's not the end of the

[23:47]
but you know it's not the end of the
world defending calls
turn is is six and i check
i have a great i have a pretty good hand
we got some value on the flop we got
some protection
uh if we now bat any races we have to
call it off i'm not

[24:00]
call it off i'm not
too thrilled about it so i decided to
check and take it a little bit easy
feeling better now i think we have an
easy call you could also consider now
raising the turn
um again a little bit more of a
protection play against like a hand like
10 jack for example

[24:16]
10 jack for example
i don't think he's really bad calling a
lot with worse but then again we do have
like some backup equity here with the
eight
uh so it can be the end of the world but
i decided to call
river now is the eighth which now then
jack did get there so that's kind of
kind of trouble i actually decided to go

[24:32]
kind of trouble i actually decided to go
for a little donkey donkey for the
people who haven't seen the donk betting
video
go back to that so you can kind of get a
better idea of
spots that i would like dunk but again
if you look at my check race range check
all turn it's going to be connecting a
lot in this region

[24:46]
lot in this region
so i think yes he might have the 10 jack
and i might not have the 10 jack this is
also why we might not jam and only bet
small
but we do improve to quite a lot of i
don't know let's say end like 910
where i had like 6 10 suited

[25:02]
where i had like 6 10 suited
and a lot of two pairs so therefore i
think using a small sizing is good he
will have a lot of top pairs
with k9 a lot over paris and that
i don't think he's betting that could
maybe sometimes call so i like my small
bet here

[25:15]
bet here
but it actually just calls with the
seven five well obviously if he's
betting these type of hands
uh i think this is more of a deeper
stack concept i don't think he should be
betting these hands all that often on
the turn
as then i could do a way more check
raising so if it
has a very high step after check raise i

[25:32]
has a very high step after check raise i
think my hand
is definitely a good candidate to check
raise again
seven then suited also three bets some
of the time
low board killing bats i decide to check

[25:46]
low board killing bats i decide to check
raise i think this is actually a fine
candidate for a check race with two
overs back doors
also if the five comes in then there's a
straight on the board
and we have like a very good hand to be
bluffing with
um an eight and nine there's just a lot
of good cards that can improve

[26:01]
of good cards that can improve
our hands our range so yeah i think it's
a fine check raising candidate
turn eight definitely one of these cards
i decided to go for a little bit
i think if you look at the board if
video does a lot of one third t betting
uh it is definitely a spot that i'm

[26:15]
uh it is definitely a spot that i'm
going to be check raising quite a lot
and also quite linear
and i think on the turn is good to have
a split in terms of your betting range
between big bad small bat let's say for
example i've had like pocket fives or
check raise their hand like ace four
or six seven i think they still want to

[26:31]
or six seven i think they still want to
be betting but not for a very big sizing
so i'd like to actually have a small
sizing here
fitting calls the river is a queen
so i think on this river a lot of our
thinner value bets on the turn are
probably now just gonna check like i'm

[26:46]
probably now just gonna check like i'm
not gonna value but again with pocket
fives or with a six
so i think those hands now become checks
and we're gonna
kind of with some hands now really
review the strength of our hand so i
think
uh just checking or maybe using a big
bad is probably a good strategy

[27:01]
bad is probably a good strategy
so i decided to throw this hand into a
big bat which
i think is fine gonna have maybe already
a better big on the turn
but as played i think the river is fine
and now it's that time where you just
cross your fingers and pray the guy
folds

[27:15]
folds
but he doesn't and he had a set well
that's quite unfortunate for
us he's obviously not folding a set
a little lint pot okay

[27:32]
a little lint pot okay
check for the bats and we decided to go
for the check race this is like more of
a check raise as initial razor in blind
versus blind
this should actually be a very big part
of your flop
betting strategy especially when boards
get a little bit lower

[27:45]
get a little bit lower
so jack high but maybe when the boards
get even lower
i think doing a lot of checking a lot of
check raising is a good strategy
fitting calls turn is a king definitely
a spot where we should be betting
but go for three quarter it's it's

[28:01]
but go for three quarter it's it's
probably okay it wouldn't have
actually mined to go a little bit bigger
i think that has some benefits here
filling calls river is an eighth now it
becomes quite close in terms of what to
do
obviously he's improving to eight do we

[28:15]
obviously he's improving to eight do we
want to check and let it maybe bluff end
like 910
or do we want to bet ourselves and get
called by a worse jack
it's quite close i would say that
with let's say for example at like jack
queen i think just checking calling

[28:31]
queen i think just checking calling
river is fine as we're chopping versus
any jack
i think this is also a fine spot that
let's say for example we did check razer
iv
which we actually concluded in these
right information we should probably not
do but if we did it i think that
becomes a good check call and i think
this hand can probably still value that

[28:46]
this hand can probably still value that
so it does actually still value bet
itself if in the races it's quite
interesting then he basically says an
8 then kind of determining factor is how
import
how aggressive is your opponent he is a
primo quite an aggressive guy so i might
have i might have sneaked out a little

[29:00]
have i might have sneaked out a little
bad call here
but vinnie just calls and he has a worse
jack which he's going to have quite
often rightly better to flop
and eight sometimes checks the flop he
called the turn and eight sometimes
holds the turn
so i think a jack or a draw is a very
big part of vinnie's range

[29:15]
big part of vinnie's range
even though we also have a jack
ace king face an open a call a call
i squeeze the recreational calls
and fellow poker mission coach shout out
miss explode calls as well

[29:32]
miss explode calls as well
a2s jack two-tone we check the
recreational bats out
vin unfolds and now it's up to us and we
check raced
um this is quite a fancy play and i
think this is a concept that i kind of

[29:45]
think this is a concept that i kind of
wanted to
take with you guys usually in lower xpr
situations if you have a skin
it's usually a fine hand actually to get
it in with in this case we're blocking
like some of his stronger hands in terms
of ace jack
and king jack so that's likely and
that's extra benefit is let's say he

[30:01]
that's extra benefit is let's say he
does have
a hand like pocket seven or something
that he decided to bet maybe not
sometimes faults
but one of the biggest benefits is one
we never get bluffed
because basically if he has a bluffy now
it's a fault

[30:15]
we can make him bad fold like some
equity let's say he stabbed
a hand like five
six of spades okay it's just two life
cards
it's kind of handling with the point uh
that i made earlier
but the most important point is that

[30:31]
but the most important point is that
he's something's going to bad call you
with words so in this case he had a
flush draw
and on this board there's quite a lot of
draws right 910 suited queen 10 suited
like queen 10 suited if he bad calls
that or bad folds that doesn't really
matter it's both
a fine result for our hand right so

[30:47]
a fine result for our hand right so
try to find some of these spots where
the spr is quite low
uh you are the air where you can put
some pressure with a skin
the um in this case having no heart
is probably fine as the recreation will

[31:00]
is probably fine as the recreation will
have quite a lot of king i flush draws
queen flush jaws asap flush draws that
he's going to call you with
okay so it's almost you could say almost
a value
check jam so i hope you guys learned
something from this
video about how to maybe construct your

[31:15]
video about how to maybe construct your
flop check raising
strategies a little bit better what kind
of cards to barrel
what kind of to look out for in terms of
do we want the bats or do we want to
maybe check and
choose some bluffs when do we want to
continue our aggression thinking of the
h3 here

[31:30]
h3 here
in these also in the street hot spots
like this last hand here
i think it's a good example to up your
aggression using check raising
strategies
now i wish you guys a lot of luck
with check raising go study the check
raise line it's a very important line

[31:45]
raise line it's a very important line
and i'm gonna see you guys in the next
video where i'm actually going to be
discussing
check raising turns i hope you guys
