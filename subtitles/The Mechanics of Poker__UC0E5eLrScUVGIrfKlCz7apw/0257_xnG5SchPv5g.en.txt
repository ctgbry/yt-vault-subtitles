Previously on the podcast, we have
interviewed five of the top competitors
from the Cash Cam World Championship
across three episodes. Now, the players
are giving us an exclusive breakdown of
some of the craziest hands that they
have played during the challenge. In
this video, Venator shows why he was

[00:17]
this video, Venator shows why he was
considered to be one of the most
aggressive players in the field. Across
five hands, we will see what many call
the bluff of the championship. Several
other extremely creative bluffs. And for
the final hands, it's guest versus

[00:31]
the final hands, it's guest versus
guest. Sherry Sweet versus Venator get
involved in a 400B three bet pot. Who
got the better? We'll find out. We open
fives under the gun. Okay, get a call.
This flop, I think I would generally

[00:45]
This flop, I think I would generally
play something like half for check. Um,
we'll see what I do in game here. I go
with half
is five. Pocket fives check.
Ever want to get funky with this hand or

[01:00]
Ever want to get funky with this hand or
I don't think it's the best turn barrel
blocking 57 ace5
um type of hands seems to block folds.
Yeah, would maybe want to bet more with
a heart blocking combo draws.

[01:15]
a heart blocking combo draws.
&gt;&gt; We check. This is where things get
interesting. We have a blocky.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I remember in game he actually
like sort of snap blocked the river like
within
five or 10 seconds. So to me,

[01:30]
five or 10 seconds. So to me,
um, I felt like he
very often just has a rivered six or,
uh, a nine because if he has a or
potentially a bluff, if he has a
stronger hand than that, I think he

[01:45]
stronger hand than that, I think he
would want to consider,
uh, the way to get the most money as
possible in in the pot. And so that
would either be by check raise or maybe
over betting himself or maybe maybe even
going for block three bet. But he would
need more than five five or 10 seconds

[02:02]
need more than five five or 10 seconds
to evaluate all those I thought with a
very strong hand. So I went for raise
with this hand
um against his rivered 6x. He somewhat
quickly went for the three bet.

[02:15]
quickly went for the three bet.
&gt;&gt; So how do you how do you now interpret
that? Do you feel like, oh, well, may
maybe my initial read was correct or you
stick to your read?
&gt;&gt; I was pretty confident in my initial
read because in in these river spots,
the snap blocks
are are so rarely nutted hands. Um, so

[02:32]
are are so rarely nutted hands. Um, so
after seeing this, I was still pretty
confident in my read that he's going to
have a lot of rivered 6x, maybe some 9x.
And then a lot of those hands are going
to look like pretty appealing bet three
bet bluffs. like if he has 67 62 65

[02:47]
bet bluffs. like if he has 67 62 65
um even something like 95 97 maybe just
decides to do this. So yeah, I blocked
the nuts here and was pretty sure he's
bluffing rivered 6x so I just shipped it

[03:00]
bluffing rivered 6x so I just shipped it
in. Not really repping much at all on my
end, but if if you think they only have
a bluff, then I think you can just go
ahead and put it in. I was going to say
I think I think I heard Owen commenting
on the hand and like the first thing he

[03:15]
on the hand and like the first thing he
said is what is he repping though like
but in your analysis it's just very
you're very decided on well he doesn't
have it who cares what I have.
&gt;&gt; Yeah I mean his his value here is like
he he check calls against half on the

[03:30]
he he check calls against half on the
flop. Um the sets almost always raise.
He can he can turn some king nine, but
um I don't even know if it if it goes in
this size. And then he can have some

[03:45]
this size. And then he can have some
pocket sixes. But again, like it's just
so hard to put these in the snap block
on river. Yeah, especially like when
eight tableabling or something. It's
just I felt like too big of a timing
tell on river.
&gt;&gt; He folded and he did have the 67, right?

[04:00]
&gt;&gt; He folded and he did have the 67, right?
If I'm correct.
I'm not sure what he had.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I'm pretty I'm pretty sure he
had the 67 because
&gt;&gt; from what I understood
you you didn't submit this hand for hand
of the week, but to gay for you, he

[04:15]
of the week, but to gay for you, he
submitted the head for you. He said this
guy deserved the head of the week. Uh
and he had 67, I'm pretty sure. So, your
read was uh spot on.
&gt;&gt; After this hand, I had to make a note
not to bluff against this guy for a
while.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a that indeed seems like a

[04:30]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a that indeed seems like a
good idea. We're in uh we're in anti
territory now. We have ace queen off in
a small blind.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, here I just mix three bet and
call. I think I tend to mainly call.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, especially the deep stack here.
Not go too crazy with the ace queen off.

[04:45]
Not go too crazy with the ace queen off.
We check. We face a pot bet.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So already on flop. Um
you know, he's starting to polarize to
something like ace jack plus maybe ace
10 plus and bluffs. Um, so yeah, clear
call with ace queen, but yeah, not not

[05:01]
call with ace queen, but yeah, not not
super thrilled.
&gt;&gt; Five 2x.
What's your thoughts here? This is uh I
think this is right the real first real
decision point.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, 2x here is a bit over 2. It's 200%

[05:15]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, 2x here is a bit over 2. It's 200%
leaving like
120% river or so. Yeah, my hand already
is a bluff catcher run turn. Maybe he
can have ace queen as well in this size,
but it's already a bluff catcher. I
could see some ace queen

[05:31]
could see some ace queen
folding in theory on turn. Maybe maybe
with the queen of diamonds more often.
Um but yeah, I had a note that this
player is quite aggressive and um I
thought I could potentially even even
chop with some of his ace queen at this

[05:45]
chop with some of his ace queen at this
point, so don't think I could fold just
yet. Yeah, I think I think the the
chopping always when when you can think
of a chop, it's always, you know, little
in extra incentive to throw the money.
In terms of the five turn, any any
concerns here in terms of uh like

[06:01]
concerns here in terms of uh like
obviously his I guess his primary bluffs
could have improved. Think like pocket
threes. So, I guess the bluffing range
would have a bit more equity. I don't
think his hand would normally bluff.
don't really think think it's going to

[06:16]
don't really think think it's going to
be more like threes and fours.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree. I I think he wants some
lower cards to bluff here or maybe some
like queen of diamonds jack for diamond
rivers. Um but yeah, the five is a brick

[06:31]
rivers. Um but yeah, the five is a brick
for his value range at least. Like he
shouldn't have ace five. He could maybe
have like fives with a diamond. But
yeah, he should have threes threes and
fours a lot. I agree. Yeah, I think like
this five is pretty interesting because
let's say for example on a six threes
and fours, you know, should still be

[06:45]
and fours, you know, should still be
part of the barreling range, but I feel
like people just always find them on a
five.
&gt;&gt; So you could say, okay, now they're
always doing it. But in the same time,
it did also give them more equity. So
the barreling range now contains more
equity than for example on a six. So I
find that always interesting debate.

[07:00]
find that always interesting debate.
Okay, what's better, the five turn or
the six turn? Like on one side he will
now always barrel his threes and fours.
We're pretty sure of that. But they also
now have more equity, which is a reason
why they barreled more. Should we call?
River is a king.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

[07:15]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Um, so I went for a very small lead
here, 10%. Uh, just with the hands you
mentioned in in mind, the threes and
fours. Um, the king on the king river. I
don't really arrive unpaired ever or
really with a hand worse than than

[07:31]
really with a hand worse than than
threes or fours. Um, it's not like I
river much if any king X, but it's more
just my range lacking air or close to
air with pocket threes and fours and and
his range having some of those hands.

[07:46]
his range having some of those hands.
So, it allows me to squeak out a tiny
bit of value with a hand like this
against his under pairs. It sort of puts
his threes and fours in a tough spot.
Um, and maybe lets me get the occasional
cheap bluff through with something like

[08:01]
cheap bluff through with something like
queen jack of diamonds or something.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I like your fault process here.
We face a gem.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, at this point, I clearly have
a bluff catcher. His value range, I
think, is just full houses. I mean,
maybe if he's going super thin, he can

[08:17]
maybe if he's going super thin, he can
also have ace queen, but I would think
it's just full houses only. Um, so he
should have four combos, ace king, uh,
three combos, pocket twos, and maybe

[08:32]
three combos, pocket twos, and maybe
give him one and a half pocket fives.
Um, so it's just a very narrow value
range and I think it's it's too tempting
when he gets to river with a hand like,
you know, jack 10, uh, queen jack um,

[08:47]
you know, jack 10, uh, queen jack um,
type hands to just surrender or call uh,
folding to one/10enth pot um, is very
hard psychologically. So I feel like in
these spots, people tend to just send it
when they when they get to river with

[09:01]
when they when they get to river with
jackai or queen eye and the value range
is quite narrow. So I just pressed call.
&gt;&gt; So confirmed he got induced
&gt;&gt; maybe. I mean I wasn't wasn't thrilled
about the spot at all but happened to
&gt;&gt; make the call and he indeed shows up

[09:15]
&gt;&gt; make the call and he indeed shows up
with the jack 10 and you uh scoop a nice
little pot. Well played. Next hand we
have jack eight suited on the button.
Stefan opens
button white anti-game two and a halfx.

[09:30]
button white anti-game two and a halfx.
&gt;&gt; What can we what's kind of your strategy
here? Yeah, an empty. I think I'm going
to V up like Jack seven suited plus and
just mix three bets and calls with with
this hand. We're very deep as well. And
I wanted to get in there against Stefan.
So, I probably just three bet this one

[09:46]
So, I probably just three bet this one
every time.
&gt;&gt; Wanted to get in there versus Stefan. I
like it. You got a call.
&gt;&gt; I went with range quarter this flop. Um
I'm not sure at 200. Maybe maybe a
bigger sizing is appropriate. um he

[10:00]
bigger sizing is appropriate. um he
should be flatting some queens and jacks
at 200.
So he's not super unprotected on this
board, but one good thing is with anti
is I can have king 10 off and he can't.
Um so I think I think range betting is

[10:15]
Um so I think I think range betting is
fine for a quarter.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I feel like if if it's quote
quote not a range bet, it's not
necessarily that if you do range bet now
suddenly Stephan can go crazy, right?
Like you have some of these boards where
you really cannot range bet because he
just connects too well and then there's
some boards that you could possibly

[10:31]
some boards that you could possibly
range bet but it's actually not really
preferred but it's more because yeah the
EV EV of checking and inducing something
just different but this board yeah I
don't really see anything going wrong if
you range bet for example.
&gt;&gt; So he makes the call

[10:45]
&gt;&gt; So he makes the call
&gt;&gt; turn the ace no donk something that you
take in consideration here I guess maybe
sometimes
&gt;&gt; I mean Stefan has dons everywhere. Hey,
he has dunks everywhere.
&gt;&gt; So, yeah, you never know. But I don't
think any dunks in theory would make

[11:00]
think any dunks in theory would make
sense. Um, and then my end, I didn't
barrel. I thought blocks too many folds
with the king jacks and jack 10s and
potentially jack nine. So, um, yeah, I
just went with Jack. I think it would be
better to barrel like sixes or something

[11:16]
better to barrel like sixes or something
like that.
&gt;&gt; I agree.
&gt;&gt; Or king X
&gt;&gt; river seven. You get the discount overb.
So not 300 but the discount 200 295.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I thought here Stefan could be

[11:32]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I thought here Stefan could be
going as thin as any a sucks. He likes
to go very thin in this sort of line. So
assuming he's taking like hands like
ace8 suited, ace9 suited, ace 10 suited,

[11:48]
ace8 suited, ace9 suited, ace 10 suited,
um ace5 suited. Um there are actually
quite a few
targets to get folds from if I jam here.
And um I would check the turn with a

[12:01]
And um I would check the turn with a
decent chunk of my full houses. Um the
ones that block too much of his
continuing range. His most common full
houseses will be ace queen and ace jack.
Um I think he he will have ace jack off
and ante. The solver bluff here will

[12:18]
and ante. The solver bluff here will
probably be queen jack just blocking
even more full houses, but I thought um
I thought my line would get a ton of
credibility from Stefon. He he hadn't
been hero calling many rivers at all

[12:31]
been hero calling many rivers at all
against me surprisingly at this point.
So yeah, I just went for it with the
jack. um removing some of the ace jacks
and and and hoping that my read was
right that he's he's going much too thin
in this overbud size.

[12:45]
in this overbud size.
&gt;&gt; So now the question is how fast did he
fold it? Because if he snap folded, he
probably didn't have an ace.
&gt;&gt; I think he tanked a little bit and
folded. Um so yeah,
&gt;&gt; possibly confirming your read.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, could could have been a hand like
ace8, ace9, but who knows? Are you

[13:01]
ace8, ace9, but who knows? Are you
grinding hard, studying solvers,
reviewing hands, but still not getting
those results that you know you're
capable of? You're putting in the time
and effort, but without clear direction,
that effort does not pay off. That is
why I created the Mechanics Leakbuster

Join the mechanics league buster program
using the link down below and looking
forward to seeing you guys in there. I
have this hand. This was this one was

[14:47]
have this hand. This was this one was
actually sent in by Kik. Yeah, this open
with empty seems marginal.
Yeah, probably okayish. Definitely from
cutoff. Definitely not from lowjack, but
from hijack potentially. I range bet 1B.

[15:02]
from hijack potentially. I range bet 1B.
&gt;&gt; He calls. So, a lot of hearts out there.
And we have two green cards. What's your
plan?
&gt;&gt; I think my hand is a decent bet. You
just want to unblock the 5x and 7x.
Those are the main folds and also some

[15:15]
Those are the main folds and also some
queen X. When he doesn't check raise
flop, it's going to remove a decent
chunk of his ace of hearts combos. And
I'm range betting flop, so I still have
all of them. And I think I want to play
a a polar turn strategy just around the
nuts.

[15:30]
nuts.
&gt;&gt; So that means we're going to go big.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I would think so. But okay,
&gt;&gt; so that's
&gt;&gt; go very big. So this is I guess I guess
you mainly want to go this big because
of your read that if he just has ace of
heart ax the majority of people would

[15:47]
heart ax the majority of people would
just be like oh you face a mimb I can
just check race right here compared to
solver who would want to have enough
balanced a six of hearts in the check
call line to basically prevent this from
happening
&gt;&gt; right yeah I mean I think people will

[16:01]
&gt;&gt; right yeah I mean I think people will
definitely call naked ace of heart
attacks some to men bet but it is very
tempting to check raise um on flop and
yeah, I just sort of thought that this
was this was the turn strategy, but it

[16:15]
was this was the turn strategy, but it
could be wrong this deep. Maybe maybe
you can't polarize turn this much. I'm
not quite sure. Um but it really depends
on your uh yeah on on that read that you
mentioned, right? Obviously, if we
remove the A6 of hearts from his range,

[16:30]
remove the A6 of hearts from his range,
the Yeah. the bigger we're going to go.
So,
&gt;&gt; he does now make the call.
Um, how do you then interpreted this?
Right. We we went very big. Uh, maybe
also is there something in in timing
here? How fast someone calls? Will you
take that in consideration? You

[16:45]
take that in consideration? You
mentioned timing a lot.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I can't quite remember his
timing in game, but here I would I would
definitely be paying attention. I mean,
any that's not the knots is going to
have to think for quite some time. So,
any sort of call on the faster side

[17:02]
any sort of call on the faster side
would be quite scary. Um, but I think in
the spot at least people will will
realize that and not um not like snap
call or something with the nuts. So
&gt;&gt; yeah, this is maybe also a good tip for

[17:15]
&gt;&gt; yeah, this is maybe also a good tip for
the audience or how I like to approach
it. I look at the situation and based on
how difficult I think the situation is
for your range. That's basically what I
depend my timing on. So if I just think,
oh, this does spot for my range, I try
to, you know, take take longer and if

[17:31]
to, you know, take take longer and if
it's just is an easy spot for my range,
I'm usually just going to make a fast
decision. So we get the call.
&gt;&gt; River is the biggest brick in the deck.
How how strong how strong are you still
from your read? He doesn't have the ace

[17:45]
from your read? He doesn't have the ace
of hearts after he calls the turn. Uh
definitely, you know, not positive, but
um yeah, he arrives to the river with
sets and then 10 of hearts, jack of
hearts, ace of hearts, and some two

[18:01]
hearts, ace of hearts, and some two
pairs potentially. Um so there there's
still a huge chunk of his range that's
going to be bluff catching against
allin. And you know, I unblock all the
folds. I have a a ton of ace of hearts

[18:15]
folds. I have a a ton of ace of hearts
combos that are worth all in here. So
yeah, this time I just went for it and
and hoped to fade the snap call. I also
feel like because people
if you think about spots where people
naturally find bluffs, it's usually

[18:31]
naturally find bluffs, it's usually
blockers to the knots, right? So let's
say there was only three hearts, people
will find a bluff with the ace of
hearts, for example. But I do feel like
also tripling off here because it should
be around unblockers and not blockers
due to kind of the nature of the spot. I

[18:47]
due to kind of the nature of the spot. I
feel like you're a bit protected on
average, right? People will find this
less bluffy because there is not really
the good bluff for you is a bit harder
to find if that makes sense. So from

[19:00]
to find if that makes sense. So from
that perspective, I definitely I
definitely really like it. It's quite a
quite a big bet. He ended up calling
with probably one of the hands you were
targeting to fold. I I would assume.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I think I think his hand

[19:16]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I think I think his hand
is a pretty reasonable call. I mean,
it's definitely better to call with two
hearts compared to just one. Um like if
he has Jack of Spades, 10 of hearts,
that would be a much worse call, just
blocking more bluffs. Um but yeah, hats

[19:32]
blocking more bluffs. Um but yeah, hats
off to him for for a good call. I think
probably
&gt;&gt; do not bluff note.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I mean this is one of the
hands where you just put it in and if
you see this then you you have to make
some adjustments but yeah I think

[19:46]
some adjustments but yeah I think
reasonable hand from him. Not sure about
my line. You know, the four flushes are
always kind of hard for me, but
&gt;&gt; yeah, they are hard.
&gt;&gt; But but I feel like if you would just
grab data of of the world of poker and

[20:00]
grab data of of the world of poker and
you would say bet over bet 3x spot on a
board like that, I think an average
bluff frequency,
I don't know. I would guess lower than
15% probably. So I I feel I feel like
you're you're probably quite pro

[20:15]
you're you're probably quite pro
protected here. I don't know how how
your image was rolling at this time, but
uh
&gt;&gt; yeah, probably not.
&gt;&gt; I take that in consideration. I think on
average when I see someone go triple
here, like I call the turn with the set
hoping to improve because I feel like he

[20:30]
hoping to improve because I feel like he
has to not flush uh and when they jam I
step that fold,
&gt;&gt; right? I think there are even some
players who might just fold the turn
with his hand. But yeah, it's um it
seems pretty
&gt;&gt; that's actually I would Yeah, actually
that's actually a good point because

[20:46]
that's actually a good point because
uh yeah, I would much rather call like
especially for the size, right? I would
much rather call king seven or king
queen or
&gt;&gt; something improve against the nuts.
Maybe there already he took in
consideration the fact that he has two
hearts instead of one, right? What you
already mentioned, it's better to have

[21:01]
already mentioned, it's better to have
this.
&gt;&gt; Oh, this guy got me good here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; off to Cherry for this hunt.
&gt;&gt; So, button opens. We threw it from the
small blinds on the bigger side. We're a
bit deep brace for suit. Seems standard
so far. Get a call.

[21:15]
so far. Get a call.
&gt;&gt; 547.
Um we're almost 200 blinds deep to
start. So have to be even more passive
on this board than normal. Three low
cards connected and and flush draw. I
won't have the sets very high frequency

[21:31]
won't have the sets very high frequency
at all. Maybe have a little bit of 68
suited, but yeah, just just not a great
board for me at all. gonna do a ton of
checking.
&gt;&gt; He steps small.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think
&gt;&gt; very often.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I expect a small stab a lot um

[21:46]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I expect a small stab a lot um
from in position here with range and
then I think my hands only call maybe
some trace amount of raising. But
&gt;&gt; what what would your uh raising strategy
here look like this deep on a board that
is favorable? I feel like like a lot of

[22:01]
is favorable? I feel like like a lot of
players they see, okay, favorable board,
so they kind of go in defensive mode,
but would you still like roughly top of
your head? Would you still reach like
what type of frequency you think here in
raising? And what would your sizing be?
&gt;&gt; Um, I think all of the over pairs can

[22:16]
&gt;&gt; Um, I think all of the over pairs can
mix some amount of raising and calling.
Same with the flush draws. Same with,
you know, hands like 67, 56. Um, even a
hand like king eight of spades or
something. Um, I'm not sure of exact

[22:32]
something. Um, I'm not sure of exact
frequency. 200 blinds deep. Maybe
something like 20%ish.
But yeah, I think you you have to be
more cautious, but still you can check
raise a hand like queens, you know, to
like 150 175ish.

[22:47]
like 150 175ish.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sizing sizing here is pretty
interesting as well. Like I was I was
thinking that I feel like I'm winging it
here. I don't know. I feel like either
125 or like 200 something along those
lines. I can see benefits in like but

[23:00]
lines. I can see benefits in like but
maybe the board's a little bit too scary
and we're maybe a little bit too deep.
Yeah. The question is do you overplay it
if you go like 200? Obviously you would
prefer to create like a a smaller SPR,
right? So that basically you can end you
can end the hand, but usually if that's

[23:16]
can end the hand, but usually if that's
no longer an option because you're
either too deep or the board is just too
good for him. Yeah. Then the strategy
can switch to like something smaller.
So, I'm actually not really sure what
would be nicer. But this hand, I think,
yeah, we we don't really do anything
else than call. I would imagine guess

[23:31]
else than call. I would imagine guess
&gt;&gt; turn jack I think is
probably better for him. Um I don't
check call the flop with much jackex at
all. Just diamonds or like ace jack with
the diamonds maybe. Um maybe some jack

[23:48]
the diamonds maybe. Um maybe some jack
eight suited. But yeah, Jack seems quite
good for him. A lot of his buffs improve
and I don't improve very often.
&gt;&gt; Phase this was this 60%.
Yeah. So here I need to be folding all

[24:02]
Yeah. So here I need to be folding all
of my
unpaired hands obviously all of the ace
queens and ace kings with a diamonds.
King queen with a diamond. Ace 10
spades.
Um all of those sorts of hands. This

[24:16]
Um all of those sorts of hands. This
hand seems quite indifferent on turn. It
removes some of his value and shouldn't
block too many bluffs and can also
improve against his value. And I think
generally this spot is overbarreled by
in position um in this sort of texture.

[24:33]
in position um in this sort of texture.
But yeah, don't feel too strongly either
way on the turn. I could see just just
pitching it being better.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if like flop I think we can expect
a high stabbing frequency, right? And
the jack I think again indeed we can we

[24:46]
the jack I think again indeed we can we
can again expect quite a high frequency.
So if your hand is already closed, I
wouldn't mind leaning a bit more to
call. So I like I like I like your call
here. River is another jack, which I
guess is good news. We now win against

[25:00]
guess is good news. We now win against
54 and we face jam.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So again, um not a very fun spot.
If we think about my range that arrives
to river, I didn't check raise flop or
turn. So a lot of over pairs will be

[25:15]
turn. So a lot of over pairs will be
removed. I still will have some um aces
will probably be the main trap. I could
have some trace amount of sevens and
then I can have
a little sprinkle of jackax

[25:30]
a little sprinkle of jackax
here and there, but you know I I don't
have a ton of good hands in this node
and for value he has
all of the sets, all of the jackacks
and then yeah, I mean if if he's a great
player like seems he was he um he can go

[25:46]
player like seems he was he um he can go
as thin as maybe A7 um or pocket eights.
Um, just realizing that I'm going to
have hands like 56, 76, ace five, ace4,
um, king 7, 78,

[26:01]
um, king 7, 78,
ace, queen of diamonds, ace, king of
diamonds. Um, so there's quite a bit to
target with a hand like eights. And I'm
going to have hands that kind of look
like good bluff catchers like ace5 and

[26:15]
like good bluff catchers like ace5 and
ace4 and 56 and 76. though. I don't
really see him bluffing with the ace of
hearts unless it's like ace 3, ace two
of hearts potentially. But I would think
those aren't the best turn barrels. Not
sure. But yeah, I think I have to end up
calling some hands like this or else I

[26:31]
calling some hands like this or else I
just don't hit the calling frequency on
the river. So I I decided to call this
time.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like your thoughts here. We
talked we talked this earlier, right,
about uh about uh not over overweing on

[26:45]
about uh about uh not over overweing on
blockers. However, this is a three bet
pot. We're in a bet by bet line. We
don't probably don't play with that many
combos.
&gt;&gt; Uh, right. Then I do think it starts to
matter if you have probably the best on
blockers and
&gt;&gt; arguably one of the better blockers,
right? Blocking pocket fives and on a

[27:01]
right? Blocking pocket fives and on a
board where
people can find the bluffs, right? You
showed Pacificity. It's a low board like
it's easy to find king queen on both
streets for example. Just throwing it
out there or like
&gt;&gt; random queen 10. Would you uh would you

[27:16]
&gt;&gt; random queen 10. Would you uh would you
maybe call this hand over like something
like pocket nines?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. I mean, I think pocket
nines is maybe the worst bluff catcher
you could get here with just um you
know, removing all the 10 nine and 8 n

[27:31]
know, removing all the 10 nine and 8 n
combos and even something like queen
nine could just barrel it off here. So
yeah, I think nines would would remove a
shitload of bluffs. But yeah, like you
said, blockers I think are are typically

[27:45]
said, blockers I think are are typically
not important, but this this spot gets
kind of narrow on river, so I think
they're important to consider.
&gt;&gt; He you did flick in the call and he
decided to show with pocket eights.
Would have been would have been an
interesting hand if if you folded nines

[28:00]
interesting hand if if you folded nines
and he showed
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a merge. I mean, it's a merge
almost on Rover. He he folds me off
nines and tens potentially and gets
called by ace5, ace4. So yeah, a great
find from Sherry. Realistically, who
value jams eight? Nobody, right? So, I

[28:15]
value jams eight? Nobody, right? So, I
think like logically he's just going to
think I'd rather call ace5 than nines.
And um yeah,
&gt;&gt; yeah, great great hand. I think I think
I completely agree with your hand. Uh
curious for the thoughts of Sherry's
pocket eights. Maybe he just thought

[28:31]
pocket eights. Maybe he just thought
that going thin for value versus you or
indeed there was some merging going on.
if there was some mering going on uh
this next level stuff you need to find
it find it in your a game I don't think
uh it's very frequent that people find

[28:45]
uh it's very frequent that people find
it I would definitely have played your
hand the same so uh yeah I want to thank
you man for sharing uh for sharing
wisdom and uh all these great hands that
you played sure the honest learn a lot
in general uh thank you a lot for coming
on and sharing your story definitely
think you're one of the tougher players

[29:00]
think you're one of the tougher players
in the challenge
