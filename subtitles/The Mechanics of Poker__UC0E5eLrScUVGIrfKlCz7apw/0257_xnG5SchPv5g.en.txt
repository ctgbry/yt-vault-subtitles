a heart blocking combo draws.

[01:15]
a heart blocking combo draws.

&gt;&gt; We check. This is where things get

[01:17]
&gt;&gt; We check. This is where things get

[01:17]
&gt;&gt; We check. This is where things get
interesting. We have a blocky.

[01:18]
interesting. We have a blocky.

[01:18]
interesting. We have a blocky.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I remember in game he actually

[01:21]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I remember in game he actually

[01:22]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I remember in game he actually
like sort of snap blocked the river like

[01:24]
like sort of snap blocked the river like

[01:24]
like sort of snap blocked the river like
within

[01:26]
within

[01:26]
within
five or 10 seconds. So to me,

[01:30]
five or 10 seconds. So to me,

[01:30]
five or 10 seconds. So to me,
um, I felt like he

[01:32]
um, I felt like he

[01:32]
um, I felt like he
very often just has a rivered six or,

[01:38]
very often just has a rivered six or,

[01:38]
very often just has a rivered six or,
uh, a nine because if he has a or

[01:42]
uh, a nine because if he has a or

[01:42]
uh, a nine because if he has a or
potentially a bluff, if he has a

[01:43]
potentially a bluff, if he has a

[01:44]
potentially a bluff, if he has a
stronger hand than that, I think he

[01:45]
stronger hand than that, I think he

[01:45]
stronger hand than that, I think he
would want to consider,

[01:47]
would want to consider,

[01:48]
would want to consider,
uh, the way to get the most money as

[01:49]
uh, the way to get the most money as

[01:49]
uh, the way to get the most money as
possible in in the pot. And so that

[01:51]
possible in in the pot. And so that

[01:51]
possible in in the pot. And so that
would either be by check raise or maybe

[01:54]
would either be by check raise or maybe

[01:54]
would either be by check raise or maybe
over betting himself or maybe maybe even

[01:57]
over betting himself or maybe maybe even

[01:57]
over betting himself or maybe maybe even
going for block three bet. But he would

[01:59]
going for block three bet. But he would

[01:59]
going for block three bet. But he would
need more than five five or 10 seconds

[02:02]
need more than five five or 10 seconds

[02:02]
need more than five five or 10 seconds
to evaluate all those I thought with a

[02:04]
to evaluate all those I thought with a

[02:04]
to evaluate all those I thought with a
very strong hand. So I went for raise

[02:06]
very strong hand. So I went for raise

[02:06]
very strong hand. So I went for raise
with this hand

[02:08]
with this hand

[02:08]
with this hand

maybe my initial read was correct or you
stick to your read?

&gt;&gt; I was pretty confident in my initial

[02:23]
&gt;&gt; I was pretty confident in my initial

read because in in these river spots,
the snap blocks

[02:27]
the snap blocks

[02:27]
the snap blocks
are are so rarely nutted hands. Um, so

[02:32]
are are so rarely nutted hands. Um, so

[02:32]
are are so rarely nutted hands. Um, so
after seeing this, I was still pretty

[02:33]
after seeing this, I was still pretty

[02:33]
after seeing this, I was still pretty
confident in my read that he's going to

[02:36]
confident in my read that he's going to

[02:36]
confident in my read that he's going to
have a lot of rivered 6x, maybe some 9x.

[02:38]
have a lot of rivered 6x, maybe some 9x.

[02:38]
have a lot of rivered 6x, maybe some 9x.
And then a lot of those hands are going

bluffing rivered 6x so I just shipped it

[03:00]
bluffing rivered 6x so I just shipped it

[03:00]
bluffing rivered 6x so I just shipped it
in. Not really repping much at all on my

[03:03]
in. Not really repping much at all on my

end, but if if you think they only have

[03:07]
end, but if if you think they only have

[03:07]
end, but if if you think they only have
a bluff, then I think you can just go

[03:09]
a bluff, then I think you can just go

[03:09]
a bluff, then I think you can just go
ahead and put it in. I was going to say

[03:11]
ahead and put it in. I was going to say

[03:11]
ahead and put it in. I was going to say
I think I think I heard Owen commenting

[03:13]
I think I think I heard Owen commenting

[03:14]
I think I think I heard Owen commenting
on the hand and like the first thing he

[03:15]
on the hand and like the first thing he

[03:15]
on the hand and like the first thing he
said is what is he repping though like

[03:17]
said is what is he repping though like

[03:17]
said is what is he repping though like
but in your analysis it's just very

[03:20]
but in your analysis it's just very

[03:20]
but in your analysis it's just very
you're very decided on well he doesn't

[03:22]
you're very decided on well he doesn't

[03:22]
you're very decided on well he doesn't
have it who cares what I have.

[03:25]
have it who cares what I have.

[03:25]
have it who cares what I have.
&gt;&gt; Yeah I mean his his value here is like

[03:28]
&gt;&gt; Yeah I mean his his value here is like

[03:28]
&gt;&gt; Yeah I mean his his value here is like
he he check calls against half on the

[03:30]
he he check calls against half on the

[03:30]
he he check calls against half on the
flop. Um the sets almost always raise.

[03:35]
flop. Um the sets almost always raise.

[03:35]
flop. Um the sets almost always raise.
He can he can turn some king nine, but

[03:39]
He can he can turn some king nine, but

[03:40]
He can he can turn some king nine, but

[03:43]
um I don't even know if it if it goes in

[03:43]
um I don't even know if it if it goes in
this size. And then he can have some

[03:45]
this size. And then he can have some

[03:45]
this size. And then he can have some
pocket sixes. But again, like it's just

[03:47]
pocket sixes. But again, like it's just

[03:47]
pocket sixes. But again, like it's just
so hard to put these in the snap block

[03:50]
so hard to put these in the snap block

[03:50]
so hard to put these in the snap block

120% river or so. Yeah, my hand already

[05:22]
120% river or so. Yeah, my hand already
is a bluff catcher run turn. Maybe he

[05:24]
is a bluff catcher run turn. Maybe he

[05:24]
is a bluff catcher run turn. Maybe he
can have ace queen as well in this size,

[05:26]
can have ace queen as well in this size,

[05:26]
can have ace queen as well in this size,
but it's already a bluff catcher. I

[05:28]
but it's already a bluff catcher. I

[05:28]
but it's already a bluff catcher. I
could see some ace queen

[05:31]
could see some ace queen

[05:31]
could see some ace queen

folding in theory on turn. Maybe maybe
with the queen of diamonds more often.

[05:36]
with the queen of diamonds more often.

[05:36]
with the queen of diamonds more often.
Um but yeah, I had a note that this

[05:39]
Um but yeah, I had a note that this

[05:39]
Um but yeah, I had a note that this
player is quite aggressive and um I

[05:41]
player is quite aggressive and um I

[05:42]
player is quite aggressive and um I
thought I could potentially even even

concerns here in terms of uh like

[06:01]

concerns here in terms of uh like
obviously his I guess his primary bluffs

[06:05]
obviously his I guess his primary bluffs

[06:05]
obviously his I guess his primary bluffs
could have improved. Think like pocket

[06:07]
could have improved. Think like pocket

[06:07]
could have improved. Think like pocket
threes. So, I guess the bluffing range

[06:09]
threes. So, I guess the bluffing range

[06:09]
threes. So, I guess the bluffing range
would have a bit more equity. I don't

[06:11]
would have a bit more equity. I don't

[06:11]
would have a bit more equity. I don't
think his hand would normally bluff.

[06:14]
think his hand would normally bluff.

[06:14]
think his hand would normally bluff.
don't really think think it's going to

[06:16]
don't really think think it's going to

[06:16]
don't really think think it's going to
be more like threes and fours.

[06:18]
be more like threes and fours.

[06:18]
be more like threes and fours.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree. I I think he wants some

[06:21]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree. I I think he wants some

[06:21]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree. I I think he wants some
lower cards to bluff here or maybe some

[06:24]
lower cards to bluff here or maybe some

[06:24]
lower cards to bluff here or maybe some
like queen of diamonds jack for diamond

[06:27]
like queen of diamonds jack for diamond

[06:27]
like queen of diamonds jack for diamond
rivers. Um but yeah, the five is a brick

[06:31]
rivers. Um but yeah, the five is a brick

[06:31]
rivers. Um but yeah, the five is a brick
for his value range at least. Like he

[06:33]
for his value range at least. Like he

[06:33]
for his value range at least. Like he
shouldn't have ace five. He could maybe

[06:35]
shouldn't have ace five. He could maybe

[06:35]
shouldn't have ace five. He could maybe
have like fives with a diamond. But

[06:36]
have like fives with a diamond. But

[06:36]
have like fives with a diamond. But
yeah, he should have threes threes and

[06:38]
yeah, he should have threes threes and

[06:38]
yeah, he should have threes threes and
fours a lot. I agree. Yeah, I think like

[06:40]
fours a lot. I agree. Yeah, I think like

[06:40]
fours a lot. I agree. Yeah, I think like
this five is pretty interesting because

[06:42]
this five is pretty interesting because

[06:42]
this five is pretty interesting because
let's say for example on a six threes

[06:43]
let's say for example on a six threes

[06:44]
let's say for example on a six threes
and fours, you know, should still be

[06:45]
and fours, you know, should still be

[06:45]
and fours, you know, should still be
part of the barreling range, but I feel

[06:47]
part of the barreling range, but I feel

[06:47]
part of the barreling range, but I feel
like people just always find them on a

[06:49]
like people just always find them on a

[06:49]
like people just always find them on a
five.

[06:50]
five.

[06:50]
five.
&gt;&gt; So you could say, okay, now they're

[06:51]
&gt;&gt; So you could say, okay, now they're

[06:51]
&gt;&gt; So you could say, okay, now they're
always doing it. But in the same time,

[06:53]
always doing it. But in the same time,

[06:53]
always doing it. But in the same time,
it did also give them more equity. So

[06:54]
it did also give them more equity. So

[06:54]
it did also give them more equity. So
the barreling range now contains more

[06:56]
the barreling range now contains more

[06:56]
the barreling range now contains more
equity than for example on a six. So I

[06:58]
equity than for example on a six. So I

[06:58]
equity than for example on a six. So I
find that always interesting debate.

[07:00]
find that always interesting debate.

[07:00]
find that always interesting debate.
Okay, what's better, the five turn or

[07:01]
Okay, what's better, the five turn or

[07:01]
Okay, what's better, the five turn or
the six turn? Like on one side he will

[07:03]
the six turn? Like on one side he will

[07:03]
the six turn? Like on one side he will
now always barrel his threes and fours.

[07:05]
now always barrel his threes and fours.

[07:05]
now always barrel his threes and fours.
We're pretty sure of that. But they also

[07:06]
We're pretty sure of that. But they also

[07:06]
We're pretty sure of that. But they also
now have more equity, which is a reason

[07:08]
now have more equity, which is a reason

[07:08]
now have more equity, which is a reason
why they barreled more. Should we call?

[07:11]
why they barreled more. Should we call?

[07:11]
why they barreled more. Should we call?

So, it allows me to squeak out a tiny

[07:48]
So, it allows me to squeak out a tiny

[07:48]
So, it allows me to squeak out a tiny
bit of value with a hand like this

[07:50]
bit of value with a hand like this

[07:50]
bit of value with a hand like this
against his under pairs. It sort of puts

[07:52]
against his under pairs. It sort of puts

[07:52]
against his under pairs. It sort of puts
his threes and fours in a tough spot.

[07:55]
his threes and fours in a tough spot.

[07:55]
his threes and fours in a tough spot.
Um, and maybe lets me get the occasional

[07:58]
Um, and maybe lets me get the occasional

cheap bluff through with something like

[08:01]
cheap bluff through with something like

[08:01]
cheap bluff through with something like
queen jack of diamonds or something.

[08:02]
queen jack of diamonds or something.

[08:02]
queen jack of diamonds or something.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I like your fault process here.

[08:05]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I like your fault process here.

[08:05]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I like your fault process here.
We face a gem.

[08:06]
We face a gem.

[08:06]
We face a gem.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, at this point, I clearly have

[08:08]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, at this point, I clearly have

[08:08]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, at this point, I clearly have
a bluff catcher. His value range, I

[08:12]
a bluff catcher. His value range, I

[08:12]
a bluff catcher. His value range, I
think, is just full houses. I mean,

[08:14]
think, is just full houses. I mean,

[08:14]
think, is just full houses. I mean,
maybe if he's going super thin, he can

[08:17]
maybe if he's going super thin, he can

[08:17]
maybe if he's going super thin, he can
also have ace queen, but I would think

[08:19]
also have ace queen, but I would think

[08:20]
also have ace queen, but I would think
it's just full houses only. Um, so he

[08:25]
it's just full houses only. Um, so he

[08:25]
it's just full houses only. Um, so he
should have four combos, ace king, uh,

[08:29]
should have four combos, ace king, uh,

[08:29]
should have four combos, ace king, uh,
three combos, pocket twos, and maybe

[08:32]
three combos, pocket twos, and maybe

[08:32]
three combos, pocket twos, and maybe
give him one and a half pocket fives.

[08:34]
give him one and a half pocket fives.

[08:34]
give him one and a half pocket fives.
Um, so it's just a very narrow value

[08:36]
Um, so it's just a very narrow value

[08:36]
Um, so it's just a very narrow value
range and I think it's it's too tempting

[08:39]
range and I think it's it's too tempting

[08:39]
range and I think it's it's too tempting

Um so I think I think range betting is

[10:15]
Um so I think I think range betting is

Um so I think I think range betting is
fine for a quarter.

Like you have some of these boards where

you really cannot range bet because he

with the king jacks and jack 10s and

with the king jacks and jack 10s and

with the king jacks and jack 10s and
potentially jack nine. So, um, yeah, I

[11:12]
potentially jack nine. So, um, yeah, I

potentially jack nine. So, um, yeah, I
just went with Jack. I think it would be

[11:14]
just went with Jack. I think it would be

better to barrel like sixes or something
like that.

[11:17]
like that.

[11:17]
like that.
&gt;&gt; I agree.

So not 300 but the discount 200 295.

[11:27]
So not 300 but the discount 200 295.

[11:27]
So not 300 but the discount 200 295.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I thought here Stefan could be

[11:32]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I thought here Stefan could be

&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I thought here Stefan could be
going as thin as any a sucks. He likes

going as thin as any a sucks. He likes

ace8 suited, ace9 suited, ace 10 suited,

[11:48]
ace8 suited, ace9 suited, ace 10 suited,

[11:48]
ace8 suited, ace9 suited, ace 10 suited,
um ace5 suited. Um there are actually

[11:51]
um ace5 suited. Um there are actually

um ace5 suited. Um there are actually
quite a few

And um I would check the turn with a

[12:01]
And um I would check the turn with a

[12:01]
And um I would check the turn with a
decent chunk of my full houses. Um the

[12:04]
decent chunk of my full houses. Um the

[12:04]
decent chunk of my full houses. Um the
ones that block too much of his

[12:05]
ones that block too much of his

ones that block too much of his
continuing range. His most common full

[12:09]
continuing range. His most common full

houseses will be ace queen and ace jack.

[12:12]
houseses will be ace queen and ace jack.

[12:12]

Um I think he he will have ace jack off

[12:14]
Um I think he he will have ace jack off

Um I think he he will have ace jack off
and ante. The solver bluff here will

[12:18]
and ante. The solver bluff here will

[12:18]
and ante. The solver bluff here will
probably be queen jack just blocking

[12:21]
probably be queen jack just blocking

[12:21]
probably be queen jack just blocking
even more full houses, but I thought um

[12:25]
even more full houses, but I thought um

[12:25]
even more full houses, but I thought um
I thought my line would get a ton of

So yeah, I just went for it with the

[12:36]
So yeah, I just went for it with the

[12:36]
So yeah, I just went for it with the
jack. um removing some of the ace jacks

[12:38]

and and and hoping that my read was

[12:41]
and and and hoping that my read was

and and and hoping that my read was
right that he's he's going much too thin

[12:42]
right that he's he's going much too thin

right that he's he's going much too thin
in this overbud size.

[12:45]
in this overbud size.

[12:45]
in this overbud size.
&gt;&gt; So now the question is how fast did he

[12:46]
&gt;&gt; So now the question is how fast did he

[12:46]
&gt;&gt; So now the question is how fast did he
fold it? Because if he snap folded, he

[12:48]
fold it? Because if he snap folded, he

[12:48]
fold it? Because if he snap folded, he
probably didn't have an ace.

[12:50]
probably didn't have an ace.

[12:50]

[19:19]
is a pretty reasonable call. I mean,

[19:20]
is a pretty reasonable call. I mean,
it's definitely better to call with two

[19:21]
it's definitely better to call with two

[19:21]
it's definitely better to call with two
hearts compared to just one. Um like if

[19:23]
hearts compared to just one. Um like if

[19:24]
hearts compared to just one. Um like if
he has Jack of Spades, 10 of hearts,

[19:26]
he has Jack of Spades, 10 of hearts,

[19:26]
he has Jack of Spades, 10 of hearts,
that would be a much worse call, just

[19:28]
that would be a much worse call, just

[19:28]
that would be a much worse call, just
blocking more bluffs. Um but yeah, hats

[19:32]
blocking more bluffs. Um but yeah, hats

[19:32]
blocking more bluffs. Um but yeah, hats
off to him for for a good call. I think

[19:35]
off to him for for a good call. I think

[19:35]
off to him for for a good call. I think
probably

[19:35]
probably

[19:35]
probably
&gt;&gt; do not bluff note.

[19:37]
&gt;&gt; do not bluff note.

[19:37]
&gt;&gt; do not bluff note.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I mean this is one of the

[19:39]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I mean this is one of the

[19:39]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I mean this is one of the
hands where you just put it in and if

[19:41]
hands where you just put it in and if

[19:41]
hands where you just put it in and if
you see this then you you have to make

[19:43]
you see this then you you have to make

[19:43]
you see this then you you have to make
some adjustments but yeah I think

[19:46]
some adjustments but yeah I think

[19:46]
some adjustments but yeah I think
reasonable hand from him. Not sure about

[19:48]
reasonable hand from him. Not sure about

[19:48]
reasonable hand from him. Not sure about
my line. You know, the four flushes are

[19:50]
my line. You know, the four flushes are

[19:50]
my line. You know, the four flushes are
always kind of hard for me, but

[19:53]
always kind of hard for me, but

[19:53]
always kind of hard for me, but
&gt;&gt; yeah, they are hard.

[19:55]
&gt;&gt; yeah, they are hard.

[19:55]
&gt;&gt; yeah, they are hard.
&gt;&gt; But but I feel like if you would just

[19:57]
&gt;&gt; But but I feel like if you would just

[19:58]
&gt;&gt; But but I feel like if you would just
grab data of of the world of poker and

you would say bet over bet 3x spot on a

you would say bet over bet 3x spot on a
board like that, I think an average

here look like this deep on a board that

Yeah. So here I need to be folding all

[24:02]
Yeah. So here I need to be folding all

[24:02]
Yeah. So here I need to be folding all
of my

[24:04]
of my

[24:04]
of my
unpaired hands obviously all of the ace

[24:06]

Um all of those sorts of hands. This

[24:16]
Um all of those sorts of hands. This

removes some of his value and shouldn't

removes some of his value and shouldn't
block too many bluffs and can also

[24:24]
block too many bluffs and can also

block too many bluffs and can also

way on the turn. I could see just just

&gt;&gt; Yeah, if like flop I think we can expect

[24:41]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if like flop I think we can expect

[24:41]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, if like flop I think we can expect
a high stabbing frequency, right? And

[24:43]
a high stabbing frequency, right? And

[24:43]
a high stabbing frequency, right? And
the jack I think again indeed we can we

[24:46]
the jack I think again indeed we can we

[24:46]
the jack I think again indeed we can we
can again expect quite a high frequency.

[24:48]
can again expect quite a high frequency.

wouldn't mind leaning a bit more to

54 and we face jam.

[25:03]
54 and we face jam.

[25:03]
54 and we face jam.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So again, um not a very fun spot.

[25:07]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So again, um not a very fun spot.

[25:07]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So again, um not a very fun spot.
If we think about my range that arrives

[25:09]
If we think about my range that arrives

If we think about my range that arrives
to river, I didn't check raise flop or

[25:12]
to river, I didn't check raise flop or

to river, I didn't check raise flop or
turn. So a lot of over pairs will be

[25:15]
turn. So a lot of over pairs will be

[25:15]

removed. I still will have some um aces

[25:18]
removed. I still will have some um aces

[25:18]

will probably be the main trap. I could

[25:21]
