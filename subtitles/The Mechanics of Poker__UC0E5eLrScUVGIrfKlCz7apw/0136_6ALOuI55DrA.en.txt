much
student

[01:45]
student
thinking about trying winimax nl10 five
max has massive differences to six max i
mean under the gun is one of your least
profitable positions and that one is
gone so yeah
great stuff
leave it here we also rolled very very

[02:00]
leave it here we also rolled very very
high here with the 5 8.
that's not our turn
yeah i thought you know we're blocking
five for pseudo blocking five four eight
suited we can turn a deuce a three a six
is seven
not bad not

[02:21]
should bad do something here but i'm
lost
chicken song for me

[02:31]
[Music]
oh pocket aces
come to me
and fly
american airlines

[02:46]
american airlines
come fly come fly away
five six nine it's a good flop after him
with the fives and the sixes and the
sevens and the eights
somebody checks

[03:04]
so we're throwing out some good beats
today guys
are you the anandapaki he asks of course
i am zaan and pokkam

[03:15]
i am zaan and pokkam
what did you think
and i think aces i'm just gonna call
well that's a very splendid turn now is
it
i think my favorite poker player of all
time is mbr402
shout out to mbr

[03:45]
the dance that you make we have pocket
aces and the guys barreling into you
very tough spot of course
to be honest it is a tough spot with
with quite uh some hands in our range
but i'm gonna call one more time
that uh 10 is very good if he did have

[04:02]
that uh 10 is very good if he did have
if he was bluffing like a hand like
queen jack
i think uh
few's quite inclined to uh
barrel through
but i think
the most likely scenario is he has a set

[04:17]
the most likely scenario is he has a set
i have a highest set
you know it's life
it's life
sometimes you are the highest sets
sometimes the other guy is a lower set
you know it's just
ah it's just how poker works

[04:31]
ah it's just how poker works
you knew also we got a little bump up
action
on table five yes i introduced the table
five
there we are
yep top pair straight away
to play with mr ermey who's probably a

[04:46]
to play with mr ermey who's probably a
fish
[Music]
what did i miss
[Music]

[05:06]
hello ben hello ben i'm gonna check this
one
[Music]

[05:31]
and now we're gonna unleash the fire
oh he also unleashes the fire god damn
it
yeah
still not falling buddy

[05:46]
if you have better you have better it's
kind of how it goes
here i was wishing for the bum pods
now i get what i deserve

[06:10]
didn't want to go too fast didn't want
to scare off the other guy
and we make a boat but so does he

[06:16]
and we make a boat but so does he
and we chop the pot you know what they
say lee everybody loves a chop pop open
up a little seven deuce seven dudes
never lose
that's not entirely true but hey

[06:39]
it's very cheaper
let's see let's see what develops

[06:47]
now why don't
there if there oh if there was just one
green card
if there was just one green card out
there it would have definitely sticked
around
okay

[07:00]
okay
check okay oh that's a deuce that's good
check again check again
or bad like two big blinds
that's too much
seven

[07:16]
seven
so you want to make 2022
your greatest poker year ever
now i've done a webinar on how to do
that in our academy which we have made
available completely for free so go over

[07:31]
available completely for free so go over
to pokerambition.com
and let me help you achieve your goals
what monitor did you get i don't know
what monitor but it's
you know it's like a tv
huge

[07:54]
uh no what do we do here
probably should probably draw the
barrel's key some of the time

[08:00]
barrel's key some of the time
gonna barrel and heart an eight a jack a
king and an ace
oh
i forgot a four but i forgot to tell her
i was also got a barrel of four you're
gonna bare for weko yes i'm gonna barrel
four

[08:15]
four
that's our roll
and now
now but now now i'm gonna draw the
biggest bet

[08:33]
i think that sounds reasonable
what do you guys think
does that sound reasonable

[08:45]
meow f pocket aces
which is generally good news
however it was a squeeze spot so tens
and queens
are definitely still uh
yeah
decent hands in this range the good

[09:01]
decent hands in this range the good
thing is we have
a heart and a
bait so basically you can have ace queen
of clubs ace queen
of diamonds erases okay that's
interesting

[09:15]
i think i proceed by calling when i have
this hand
very interesting turn should probably
lead
should i lead
i feel like i should lead

[09:33]
yes

[09:50]
he calls

[10:19]
i add the ice cream
oh we should have shipped it in i think
we should probably get called by like
four and a half combo yeah guys we want

[10:31]
four and a half combo yeah guys we want
a one dollar blast thank you 888
love it
now that's a good flop
trips

[10:46]
trips
so yeah we perfect to get called by like
i think four and a half combos or
something
so yeah that's eight screen suited that
were two
king jack of spades one

[11:04]
yeah
that's kind of where where where i get
lost right
that was kind of the problem of it

[11:27]
gonna ship it in sometimes you know what

[11:30]
gonna ship it in sometimes you know what
time it is
it's time to
i think it's just time to ship it in and
go to bed
exactly definitely think that if he has
a screen race king no spade is just
gonna fold now so yeah that's uh
it's quite good

[11:46]
it's quite good
this guy been playing uh i think every
hand
and i think i'm gonna

[12:02]
and i think i'm gonna
check this river
and here i'm gonna
membranes assume he's just gonna stack
up with anything

[12:30]
i guessed out to save himself three
three bucks
very far
let's see if we can kill him now

[12:51]
nope not yet
now he's not yet the time
he lives to fight another day oh but now

[13:01]
he lives to fight another day oh but now
you got a name with king deus off versus
jax that's not good
it's not good
yeah that's not good

[13:18]
fatality flawless victory introducing
the flat call again
i'm gonna play uh
i'm gonna play some of these small
pocket press we'll give you guys some

[13:31]
pocket press we'll give you guys some
some advice the last tip i have for you
is on small pocket pairs
and these are hands that you can win
monster pods so when you get delta
pocket pair try to flop a set
play it smooth and win all the money

[13:45]
play it smooth and win all the money
[Music]
we have no set
yet
we still turn some [ __ ]

[14:05]
there's a check race we just fold
i would definitely continue sixes for
example
i don't think threes i'm gonna continue

[14:20]
as you might have
alluded to when mentioning that you know
how the other position plays when the
back the fly's gone he does shove a
small frequency in position as
three-fourth as the most common size in

[14:31]
three-fourth as the most common size in
wizard
now yeah obviously we still will have
shelves
which is then reserved obviously forever
flush or a great blocker to the call
range
and then probably that's i know we
probably barrel

[14:46]
probably barrel
jack 9 off suit the jack of spades some
of the time in order to have gems
so it's the three the three quarters
yeah
in game i was going for a half pot

[15:01]
in game i was going for a half pot
i did pop the turn maybe uh maybe wizard
went three quarters
i think it's a mix there on the turn
between like slight over battery
quarters so i went just for a pot bed
because the sbi is a bit weird to bet

[15:15]
because the sbi is a bit weird to bet
three quarters
so i wanted to go half pot
then i also thought yeah
let's say he has a jack with ace of
spades
or ace them with ace of maybe he just
reblushed me you know so it's like yeah
[ __ ] it i i check i give up

[15:31]
[ __ ] it i i check i give up
that was kind of my conclusion this is
all something i explained in that
webinar often then people wait
for when they feel more confident right
or they go work on their game because i
feel like ah if i would just work more
on my game then i don't have to be

[15:45]
on my game then i don't have to be
afraid right so then they get stuck into
wanting to improve approvals never ready
then i give this great that great advice
which is the act
of confidence comes first
so showing courage
doing it despite the fear

[16:01]
doing it despite the fear
and the feeling comes after
bucket force i'm gonna check ship this
on the turn

[16:15]
too bad i have a spade
we should probably do this some of the
time at 98
i think it's a fine play
defaults very spicy
very spicy play this is this is getting

[16:31]
very spicy play this is this is getting
spicy this is getting spicy this is
spicy as [ __ ] spice
spice
so instead of
being paralyzed by fear
taking that step

[16:46]
taking that step
okay
and you will see once you start playing
you get like also it doesn't moving off
i don't think there is a single player

[17:00]
i don't think there is a single player
out there
that was comfortable the first couple of
sessions that he played at his highest
stake it's completely normal
but yeah how does that feeling go away
by actually playing
especially if you're a perfectionist is

[17:15]
especially if you're a perfectionist is
quite difficult because you're not gonna
bring your a game now if you like this
