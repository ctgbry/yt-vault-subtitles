[Music]

[01:16]
[Music]
welcome back to another episode of the
mechanics of Poker podcast happy to
announce that today gonna be talking to
Ben Heath when he plays high rollers
mtt's mainly life Ben Heath was actually

[01:32]
mtt's mainly life Ben Heath was actually
one of the fastest risers five to six
years he took him to reach the High
Roller level so that's a very fast Riser
and today he's agreed to come on our
podcast in order to share his wisdom in
the hope that you will learn something

[01:46]
the hope that you will learn something
in order to make more progress in your
poker career as well Adam anything that
you're particularly curious for to learn
about Ben
yeah well he plays the super high
rollers and these guys are a different
breed generally they have a different

[02:01]
breed generally they have a different
relationship with risk they built their
mindset in a different way where they're
playing for houses and cars every
tournament and they're unaffected by the
large money swings that come with that
see I'm gonna be intrigued to know what
kind of mindsets kind of routines our
approaches he went through to yeah kind

[02:16]
approaches he went through to yeah kind
of build a mindset that's able to deal
with the validity that comes with
playing those super high rollers
yeah I think for a lot of us listening
and for me as well I would think it's
the first thing that will probably come
in mind is a bit scary right what if you

[02:30]
in mind is a bit scary right what if you
lose right yeah you can lose a lot so
yeah they have a different Association I
guess with losing and taking risk in
general that I'm very curious to
um yeah to discover through this
conversation before we start I would

[02:45]
conversation before we start I would
like to give a big shout out to our

mechanics but without further Ado let's
start today's episode with Ben Heat
welcome Mr Ben Heath to the pot very
excited for our conversation today

[03:45]
excited for our conversation today
oh yeah me too thanks for having me on
you just got a back from the PCA in the
Bahamas I think uh poker players are
probably one of the few people that go
to Bahamas come back on 10th right which
I guess is is a good sign because that

[04:00]
I guess is is a good sign because that
meant you were spending a lot of time
playing in the poker tournaments how did
it go for you uh yeah it was fine I
ended up down small in the end uh still
kind of recovering coming back this way
is always tough for jet lag
yeah I can imagine uh jet lag is a big

[04:17]
yeah I can imagine uh jet lag is a big
issue it's like eight hour time
difference or something
uh especially 76 so
uh not too bad but I think just like the
combination of it was 13 days in a row
of playing so you're kind of sleep

[04:31]
of playing so you're kind of sleep
deprived anyway and then
you know this is the tough way to come
for me jet lag wise so
do you before you go do you already kind
of get accustomed to the time schedule
beforehand like you know oh the
tournaments are going to be between

[04:45]
tournaments are going to be between
these times I'm going to try to be at my
Peak so before I go I already kind of
shift my my sleeping schedule do you do
you do something like that uh a little
yeah I mean this year I just went out
three days early
and going out that way is not too hard

[05:01]
and going out that way is not too hard
especially because like
you like the weather's so nice there
that you can get out in the morning and
get in the Sun and I think that helps
you adjust to the time zone a lot
quicker than coming back this way and it
being winter

[05:15]
being winter
um that makes sense so like just having
and I think it's the easier way to go
that way to go uh that way anyway so
three days was enough for me I felt fine
by the time I was playing but yeah if I
was gonna show up the day before then I
would adjust my sleep schedules at home

[05:31]
would adjust my sleep schedules at home
it's interesting that you mentioned you
ended up down a little bit because I I
knew that you were going to PCA and then
I checked before we had the looked up
Hannah mop I saw three caches I was like
okay great success second place uh but
it's so it's interesting like if

[05:45]
it's so it's interesting like if
obviously if you look at for example a
hand a mob of certain players you see
okay all-time winnings I don't know how
many millions uh but obviously it
doesn't give
how can I say like a true reflection of
how it actually went do you sometimes or

[06:00]
how it actually went do you sometimes or
do you feel like players sometimes
struggle with it looks like they made
Millions but maybe in the same time they
will break even due to I don't know the
biggest being that they had they only
had a part of their a piece of
themselves
uh

[06:16]
I don't know if I would say struggle
with it I know I've had times where
people who aren't in poker
assume that you have a lot more money
than you do because if you Google
someone in poker one of the first thing
that comes up is send them up so someone

[06:30]
that comes up is send them up so someone
might be like oh you've
150 million when yeah you haven't I mean
I think like cash for like 700 000 maybe
in Bahamas
but you know there were 200ks there was
the 250k
and then I was in the 50ks four times

[06:46]
and then I was in the 50ks four times
and then 25k so I was in for around 700.
yeah exactly
that's indeed yeah struggles maybe not
not the correct word but I remember I
think it was
I think I heard fader talk about this

[07:00]
I think I heard fader talk about this
when he went on in the same run and then
he felt like uh he he couldn't complain
right he was feeling a bit [ __ ] because
he was down but to the outside what are
you complaining about you went on the
biggest heater of your life or something
but he said yeah from the outside
looking in it may seem like that but it

[07:16]
looking in it may seem like that but it
was actually not the case
yeah I mean I think
that does happen a lot especially at
these like these trips these at the
moment
uh a lot of the high stakes games have
become unlimited re-entry

[07:31]
become unlimited re-entry
so
I think it was the same in
in Cyprus last year at Triton I got uh I
chopped a 50k
um I think for maybe like 500k or

[07:45]
um I think for maybe like 500k or
something
but again it's there was you know
multiple 25ks multiple and then there
was a 50k I think 250k is a 75k and 100K
and they're all unlimited re-entry
so

[08:00]
so
people see it like oh congrats you
dropped to an event
you know a good trip but you could have
been in for 800 and shot one for 500. uh
I think that's happening even more so
these days with these unlimited
re-entries because no one sees people
people might just be like Oh you mean

[08:15]
people might just be like Oh you mean
cash with 100K it's like yeah I was in
for four though so main cash in for like
160.
isn't it
like so it's not like the poker news
reporter comes to you what are you gonna
do with the money that you made like oh
yeah to be fair you know how much I

[08:31]
yeah to be fair you know how much I
actually made this maybe a little bit
different uh I'm sure I'm sure our
listeners uh will are aspiring to play
high rollers in tropical destinations as
well uh I'm sure your story that we're
gonna cover today will I hope Inspire

[08:46]
gonna cover today will I hope Inspire
and maybe we can teach some lessons to
make it more likely for that to happen
right that's kind of the goal we have
with this podcast you first got into
touch with poker I think when you were
16 so that's what 14 years ago for you I

[09:01]
16 so that's what 14 years ago for you I
think you're 30 years old now uh What
attracted you towards the game and what
made you take the game more serious the
years to follow compared to like the
guys that you started playing poker with
uh

[09:16]
uh
yeah I can't remember exactly when I
started I think it was around 16 it was
in like high school college time
um
I'd always like games like I played a
bit chess when I was younger uh a bunch
of like

[09:31]
of like
online strategy games
um and I also kind of like gambling when
I was younger uh not that I could do
much but like scratch cards or whatever
always interested me

[09:45]
always interested me
um
so I think when some friends were
playing I
wanted to try it out
but it would just be like
you know we're 16 so we couldn't play
online and there's a limit to how much
you can go around someone's house with

[10:01]
you can go around someone's house with
eight people and play uh when it's you
know your parents house so
uh we didn't play that much it was maybe
like once a month
um
and then
when I went to University

[10:16]
when I went to University
I was playing online then because I was
18 at the time and but didn't really
have much time like I wanted to play
more but I think my
my University was like 27 hours a week

[10:30]
my University was like 27 hours a week
of contact hours and then another 20 to
25 of self-study
so again I didn't really have much time
I would just play maybe like
five to seven hours a week of setting
those to make some money uh

[10:47]
those to make some money uh
so just like University expenses uh so
you didn't need a job next to your
University basically you could fund your
expenses which you know if you're a
student usually aren't that high you
could you could pay for that through

[11:00]
could you could pay for that through
playing City goes online
yeah well I mean I got a university loan
so I really didn't have much expenses in
terms of like my accommodation and my
tuition was
covered by the loan
um and my parents helped me out as well

[11:17]
um and my parents helped me out as well
and then like I uh so I had just like if
I wanted to spend extra
um
you know I mean when you're at
University of your accommodation and

[11:30]
University of your accommodation and
tuition is covered by the loan there's
really not much that's it right
so yeah I I just did yeah so yeah so I
was just doing that and uh my University
was quite like quite a few poke players

[11:45]
was quite like quite a few poke players
uh
came out of my University
um and it was like I asked
I spoke to my
future about it you have like a private
tutor who manages like

[12:01]
tutor who manages like
eight people uh and
he had known
I think he had had like another four
people in the five years before me who
had gone on to play pokercraft
University so it was actually like a
little more common than I thought at the

[12:15]
little more common than I thought at the
time so it was quite easy to imagine
doing it in the future
hmm do you did you know personally any
of them or was it just like hey so I've
heard that through after uni people have
you know pursued playing poker

[12:30]
you know pursued playing poker
professionally so I guess this is
something you can actually do it kind of
opened your mind up for the
possibilities that did this was actually
a thing
yeah I didn't know them I mean I knew
there I was told their names at the time
but I didn't know them personally but

[12:45]
but I didn't know them personally but
yeah I mean
at the time we I was kind of being told
in my degree that
too common the most common routes I
think were going into banking or finance
and going into teaching those were like

[13:00]
and going into teaching those were like
the two parts that were most often
pursued
and
then a few students and my tutor
kind of made it clear to me that poker

[13:15]
kind of made it clear to me that poker
was an option as well where you know
beforehand I kind of saw it as more of a
hobby I knew they were professional
players because when I was playing at 16
like we all knew there were
professional players and would watch
people on Full Tilt and stuff but I
didn't it didn't feel like it was much

[13:31]
didn't it didn't feel like it was much
of an option I didn't really see the
route to get there uh so it definitely
helped kind of at least put it in my
head that that was an option
um
to clarify for the people listening you
started mathematics it's not like every
school would sort of say like yeah sure

[13:46]
school would sort of say like yeah sure
poker is a is a good career path but I
can definitely see the association
between mathematics was it uh the movie
21 wasn't it also like uh mathematics
students that went to that went with
their professor professor to Vegas to uh

[14:01]
their professor professor to Vegas to uh
to make him a lot of money in blackjack
yeah yeah okay so guys if you want a
route towards poker or Blackjack I guess
mathematics school is is is a great
place to start I was curious like

[14:16]
place to start I was curious like
throughout the spirit when you started
16 and when you start to play a bit more
serious sitting goes throughout
University that was like the first time
that you realized that poker was
actually a skill game and that you had
very much control based on the
strategies that you've implemented

[14:32]
strategies that you've implemented
uh
I mean I think I I always
thought it was a skill game just because
that's how I was introduced to it I was
just introduced to it as another
strategy game
uh and you know from the race start

[14:46]
uh and you know from the race start
like I said we saw people on Full Tilt
and sponsored pros and
that was kind of instantly in my head
that if there are Pros it's a skill game
uh
which you know because you don't have
like professional blackjack players that

[15:03]
like professional blackjack players that
aren't cheating or like manipulating
something oh yeah that makes sense I I
guess the question is more the amount of
skill involved compared to luck like for
me personally for example in the

[15:16]
me personally for example in the
beginning obviously I thought okay well
I'm in control you know I do these moves
and then I started to pick up oh this is
actually something I do I would
Implement a strategy and would actually
see it working and then as I implemented
more strategies and saw it actually you
know the things were actually happening

[15:30]
know the things were actually happening
the way I wanted to that's when I
started to understand like oh wow
there's actually quite a lot of depth
into this game in terms of skill wise
yeah okay I I think maybe that came for
me after University because I still
wasn't very good at University I was
just playing like
some low State sitting goes that weren't

[15:47]
some low State sitting goes that weren't
very tough
and
I was still
I think had like limited
understanding and like
intuitive ability a lot of deeper parts

[16:01]
intuitive ability a lot of deeper parts
of the game
and I think it was like not until I
started playing full-time that maybe I
realized how how much control you do
have or like how little luck can be
involved in the long run once you really

[16:15]
involved in the long run once you really
know what's going on
you also mentioned uh you're playing
strategy games and in general I think
you mentioned that you're a very
competitive person I mean you have to be
right you play The High Roller scene I
think probably the people that uh that
play those tournaments are probably some

[16:30]
play those tournaments are probably some
of the most competitive people in poker
um
how does competing
at the highest level make you feel and
where did you develop this
um this relationship with being very

[16:45]
um this relationship with being very
competitive that's
uh
I think I was just always naturally like
that I remember when I was when I was
young whether it was with other people
or myself like if I played a game on my

[17:01]
or myself like if I played a game on my
own
I would kind of
uh
get semi-obsessed with it until I'd got
you know until I completed the game
uh
so

[17:15]
so
I don't know whether that is
so you know I don't know very clear
memories of when I was like one to ten
so I don't know if it's something that
came from something or whether I just
was naturally like that but
the memories I do have I was just always

[17:30]
the memories I do have I was just always
like that with games like if I played a
game I wanted to play it
all the time and be very good at it and
if I didn't like it enough to do that I
didn't really want to play it much
like I would still play you know I would

[17:45]
like I would still play you know I would
play like Monopoly with friends and
stuff and you know I'm not super
competitive at those because
I'm not trying to be and it doesn't
really bother me if I lose it's
something I'm not trying it
does this competitiveness sometimes get

[18:01]
does this competitiveness sometimes get
in the way you play a fun game with
friends family uh you maybe take it a
little bit too competitive
uh yeah I don't actually find that too
much I think that like if I'm not if
it's just a game for fun and I'm not

[18:16]
it's just a game for fun and I'm not
trying to learn the game and improve it
then I don't really mind if I lose as
much uh I'm still somewhat competitive I
think like most people are you want to
win rather than lose a lot but it
doesn't bother me like poker does

[18:31]
doesn't bother me like poker does
yeah you cannot just turn off the
analytical part of your brain right
let's say you go play a game and you
play with people who are just you know
they play games for fun but you
immediately see sort of you have an
overview okay this is probably the
correct strategy you implement this

[18:45]
correct strategy you implement this
strategy and then you win it's like you
you cannot just say okay I'm just gonna
sort of relax enjoy and not play the
correct strategy yeah I said it's really
weird
yeah I definitely have that
uh that that actually makes a lot of
sense it's interesting that you said uh

[19:02]
sense it's interesting that you said uh
not only the the competitive nature in
terms of competing versus other players
but you also said you were very
interested in a game where you're just
competing against yourself
uh
yeah I guess competing against myself in
terms of I used to play I think it was

[19:17]
terms of I used to play I think it was
like Rome Total War
so you're not playing against any you
can play against other people I think
but there's also just a setting where
you just play against the computer
and

[19:31]
and
everything's preset based on the
difficulty level you choose
and then
you so yeah you're playing against
yourself in the way of you're trying to
improve on your past performance
is there a difference in terms of how

[19:46]
is there a difference in terms of how
you handle loss compared to if you would
lose against a computer or if you would
lose to a fellow human being
do you take it a bit more personal
uh
it's a good question I mean I think most

[20:02]
it's a good question I mean I think most
a lot of the games that I played like if
you're playing
yeah I mean I think I would take it
slightly worse against humans if it's in
person maybe because you just have that

[20:15]
person maybe because you just have that
thing of like it feels a bit closer but
a lot of the games I played even against
people with it's like
like now if I play chess online or
something
it's not completely clear that you're
playing at someone else not a computer
because it's like there behind the
computer screen so in those things then

[20:31]
computer screen so in those things then
like in those online games it would be
similar because whether you're playing
against the computer or a person
it's not that obvious who's controlling
it and it's more like if you make a
mistake it's annoying and it doesn't

[20:45]
mistake it's annoying and it doesn't
really matter whether you made it
against a computer a person
yeah it makes a lot of sense I can
relate to that I I we used to play a lot
of FIFA when I was younger and there's
definitely a big difference in terms of
like playing against computer or playing
against a friend who's sitting next to
me who would also rub it to my face if I

[21:01]
me who would also rub it to my face if I
would lose or if I would make a mistake
or if I would make a try to make a play
that feels like seriously you try to
make that play how bad are you you know
you get you you get you get very
triggered
um I'm curious also like a mathematics
degree how did that help you in your

[21:18]
degree how did that help you in your
poker career how did you
apply the things that you learned
through uni how did you apply that to
Poker

[21:30]
uh
I think I mean a lot of
a lot of what you do at University isn't
that applicable in for in like everyday
poker because it's a lot of uh

[21:46]
poker because it's a lot of uh
I think I buy my third year I was doing
a lot of analysis and group Theory and
those are just not things you need like
most of the time when you're playing
poker it can just be simple like
adding or like working out products
uh

[22:01]
uh
I think
it was helpful in some extent like
the my degree was a lot of uh you have
to do a lot of proofs so it's a lot of
like
being

[22:15]
being given a theory and having to
prove it from
like
from the ground up and it might just be
like a two or three page proof and I
remember the first year I would struggle
a lot with missing something so you have

[22:30]
a lot with missing something so you have
to kind of a lot of things would need
separating so it's like you prove it for
real numbers you prove it for imaginary
numbers and you prove it for zero in
that
and then like those three together is
the entire proof and

[22:46]
the entire proof and
my first year when I hadn't really had
much experience with that in college
it was very easy to miss something just
like
suddenly realized at the end that the
method you're using doesn't work for the
zero case

[23:00]
zero case
and I I think that kind of mindset is
helpful in poker of
while going into the to like each micro
thing keeping an idea of the macro
picture and making sure that like your

[23:15]
picture and making sure that like your
logic lines up for every part
um because I think that's like quite a
common mistake in poker is
zeroing in on something and being like
whether it's Theory or like a live read
like oh you know this doesn't really
make sense and then you completely

[23:30]
make sense and then you completely
forget something else like a previous
Street or some other part of information
that overrides that uh so I think that
was quite helpful in terms of
thought process and like decision making
um
and then I think some stuff as well just

[23:45]
and then I think some stuff as well just
you know we did a lot of work on
probabilities and
I remember being told some stuff about
how bad the human brain is uh
interpreting or like

[24:00]
interpreting or like
our intuition isn't built
to estimate well like uh
tail cases of probabilities
[Music]
um
and I think some stuff like that is
quite helpful for

[24:16]
quite helpful for
dealing with downswings or upswings
um
and yeah I guess just other other parts
of Pokemon I think there was a lot of
somewhat relevant stuff but it's not
like I'm sitting and using the like

[24:31]
like I'm sitting and using the like
course that I did in University to solve
poker stuff
no yeah I I I can imagine but it does
indeed sound like especially in your
thought process and I also indeed in
understanding the variance understanding

[24:46]
understanding the variance understanding
the variants of numbers uh stuff like
that I think has definitely benefited
you I usually say when people people ask
like oh yeah math you have to be very
good I'm perfectly very very very bad at
math so I always say listen math is a

[25:00]
math so I always say listen math is a
bit overrated but you would make the
argument is is math and poker a bit
overrated or am I missing something
because you obviously look at the memory
from a way more mathematical approach
whereas I look at things way maybe
intuitively I am actually good at math

[25:15]
intuitively I am actually good at math
uh but not rationally or from a universe
if you put me in a mathematics
University I would suck very badly but
maybe the math that is required in poker
intuitively I do well
I don't know
yeah I mean I think
it's quite hard for me to say I guess

[25:31]
it's quite hard for me to say I guess
whether it's operation or not like I'm
not actually sure look I I know most
people view it
like you need to be good at maths but I
think a lot of it is like working out
portals so I don't think you need to be
incredible at maths
um I think

[25:47]
um I think
then also like products at some point or
at least maybe I'm talking from uh this
is purely personally like I'm not
sitting at the table actively working
out products it it goes way more
intuitively I know approximately how

[26:00]
intuitively I know approximately how
much else I have it's not like I'm
counting right yeah
uh yeah I mean I think there's some more
in-depth stuff like that that it helps
to be quicker
um
also requires more mathematics than cash

[26:16]
also requires more mathematics than cash
games
yeah I think so
yeah well I mean I think I think cash
games especially if you're just playing
like 100 big Zoom online or something is
so repetitive that a lot of the
decisions are
you know once you've let them

[26:30]
you know once you've let them
it's not that hard because people follow
similar sizing schemes so it's just like
you're facing like b33 B70 or B150 a lot
and like and then you're like you have a
similar stack of most times as well

[26:45]
similar stack of most times as well
um yeah that actually makes a lot of
sense because I sometimes
forget the odds in four bed pots so
maybe that makes sense because it's less
common the spr is very shallow the bets
are very small and then I sometimes over
fold because like the amount that you

[27:01]
fold because like the amount that you
have to defend in the four butt versus
all these like 20 20 type of bets is is
very big but maybe there the fact that
I'm not consciously working out the math
is actually costing me whereas in
tournaments you probably have more of

[27:15]
tournaments you probably have more of
these situations where your math is
constantly being activated
yeah I mean I think with the changing
Stacks that does happen a lot in
tournaments because you can be playing
you're often playing variable stack
sizes so it's like someone opens off 30

[27:30]
sizes so it's like someone opens off 30
and you have a hundred
with the other guy
so
it's
yeah it is a lot more active I think in
your thinking in terms of when you're
doing like pre-flop sizes or Flop sizes

[27:46]
doing like pre-flop sizes or Flop sizes
there's two different Stacks involves
you do have to be a lot more aware of
what's going on it's not as kind of
routine as 100 bits cash where
everything's the same like in 100 base
cache you know you see a lot of people
online that just have their
open sizes for anything that's not the
button they're open size for the button

[28:01]
button they're open size for the button
and then they just have like imposition
format and out of position four-bit and
those stay like relatively similar
uh so even in format pots where you're
not in them as much you're still
probably just facing the same sizes a
lot
yeah yeah that actually makes a lot of

[28:15]
yeah yeah that actually makes a lot of
sense when I play a tournament it's
never online it's only live which is
happens on occasion but that's actually
something that like my brain is being
put to the test I have to calculate
every time also I have to calculate how
much shits people have people have
various chips yeah it's so tiring for my

[28:31]
various chips yeah it's so tiring for my
brain personally I get very confused
quite easily I've the amount of times
that I've just made blunders based on
the fact that I thought had more or less
someone else had more less oh this
happens to me so often uh but hey that's
why I'm I guess a fun player in live

[28:46]
why I'm I guess a fun player in live
tournaments
um you mentioned the role models right
you had some role models in terms of
other students that studied mathematics
went into poker you also saw that it was
possible as a profession because you saw
guys gambling high stakes and Full Tilt

[29:01]
guys gambling high stakes and Full Tilt
any uh
any any um role model that really stood
out back then in the food field games
that you were like I want to be like him
I we had someone on the Pod mentioned
there and then he would try to play like
there and it cost him a lot of money

[29:16]
there and it cost him a lot of money
uh yeah I don't
I remember specifically having
any one person I know that like as I
progressed through University I just was

[29:30]
had it more in my mind that that would
be a good option uh
like especially I you know I went to
some interviews with banks and like
didn't really feel like that was what I
wanted to do

[29:45]
wanted to do
so I think both things were
like I was enjoying Pokemon and
the other options were looking less
attractive so as a concept I was had
like wrong yeah not a specific role
model I just was like oh the people who

[30:01]
model I just was like oh the people who
are Pros I would like to be a pro but
not one person
um I think if anything like
there was uh I think it was Rupert Elder
I think that was his name uh and he he

[30:15]
I think that was his name uh and he he
graduated a few years before me
um
and
played poker pretty high stakes for a
while and then I think he moved on to
other stuff
um
and if anything I I was more

[30:32]
and if anything I I was more
I messaged him like after University
just asking for any advice on getting
started and if anything it was people
like that that I looked up to a bit more
just because it was a lot more relatable
like you see da and it's just more
tangible I didn't really know anything
about his story just hearing someone

[30:46]
about his story just hearing someone
that had my same tutor as me and at the
same University
and did a very similar course to me
three years before and was now playing
high stakes it's like a lot more
relatable
what were your expectations starting out

[31:00]
what were your expectations starting out
right you said it's a good option what
made poker a good option did you see the
the financial side or did you see the
competitive side did you just really
like the game like you went to Banks you
fought okay those were not great options
what made poker a good option

[31:16]
what made poker a good option
uh
I mean I think the main thing was that
it
didn't really feel like a job so you
know people are like oh these are the
three jobs you can go for and to me two

[31:30]
three jobs you can go for and to me two
of them really felt like a job where
it's like something I don't really want
to do but they give you money for doing
it
and then the third option was like oh
you can play the game that you're
already obsessed with and kind of

[31:46]
already obsessed with and kind of
addicted to
and want to do all the time anyway and
then we'll like also maybe give you
money for that if you're good at it so I
was like okay well I'm off being offered
you know to pursue three jobs and one
doesn't really sound like a job to me so

[32:00]
doesn't really sound like a job to me so
I think that was the main attractive
thing of you know I also liked having
even a University at the time
it was very high
hours that were
needed for the course but you still have

[32:16]
needed for the course but you still have
some sort of time Freedom like I got to
choose those hours
uh and if I didn't want to go to a
lecture I could just not go and there
was no
repercussions for that you just not go
you get the notes of a friend and it's
fine

[32:30]
fine
so you know and the
uh
things I was looking into would
definitely take that away and I really
liked having freedom of time
and didn't really want to go into I know

[32:46]
and didn't really want to go into I know
that like
I had friends that did end up going into
banking shelves University and I know
like the first few years especially are
really demanding
um so I think
poker just offered

[33:01]
poker just offered
quite a
something different and something that I
really wanted to do so I felt like I
could always fall back and do the other
things which may have not been true I
know that actually it's much harder to
get certain jobs if you take you know a

[33:16]
get certain jobs if you take you know a
few years after University they want
people just coming out of the University
but uh at the time I just felt you know
if this goes wrong I can do something
else but it's worth giving it a go
it makes sense take the job that doesn't
feel like a job right yeah

[33:30]
feel like a job right yeah
it makes a lot of sense Adam
uh in the in the foothill days did you
have any of the guys that you looked up
to they were like oh I'm gonna be like
that guy or was it more like Ben someone
close in your environment in your
environment that kind of walked a

[33:45]
environment that kind of walked a
similar path than you that made it a bit
more tangible and realistic
I still love watching the live high
stakes poker games with dwan Ivy
Antonius but like Ben says like there's
an element of it where it just didn't
feel realistic like for myself I mean it
was entertainment I was like wow these

[34:00]
was entertainment I was like wow these
guys are playing for hundreds of
thousands millions and that's got me
interest in the game as a curiosity for
the the removal factor for myself and
then just seemed like sore thick the
grass that I didn't I was a fan of the
game rather than anything but in terms
of enjoying program I loved I watched

[34:15]
of enjoying program I loved I watched
probably every season the Fire Sticks
poker me and my friends used to watch it
and play home games
um a university so that definitely got
me interested in the game and the
Strategic side of it uh but I took a lot
longer to get like kind of role models
that were more relatable who I could get
learned from more directly

[34:30]
learned from more directly
um so yeah Ben for yourself I'm curious
to know when you've graduated from
University so it sounds like you were
almost ancient to play more poker during
University it didn't quite get around to
it because of the study demands when
you've graduated obviously you mentioned
the three options by teaching and

[34:45]
the three options by teaching and
finance and then the third one kind of
big book when you decided you're going
to go down the poker path how did you
approach that did you decide you're
going to give yourself x amount of time
to go all in with it was it more of a
casual thing toaster like Kiowa the
initial steps into you becoming a pro
poker player began

[35:01]
poker player began
yeah I mean
I think after I think I left University
in 2014
and
I
spoke to my parents about it and they

[35:16]
spoke to my parents about it and they
were supportive and we kind of all
agreed that there should be some sort of
time limit because
it is still
a
you know it's a game which games
themselves can be addictive when there's

[35:30]
themselves can be addictive when there's
no gambling involved
and then it's gambling which is very
addictive
so you have two things that like
can have a lot of bias and it's very
easy to convince yourself that you're
good or that it's going well when it's

[35:46]
good or that it's going well when it's
not
so we kind of agreed that I would do it
for two years
and I think the aim was
to
[Music]
be not necessarily have made but be on

[36:01]
be not necessarily have made but be on
track
if because I was like thinking about
playing cash games or selling those or
something with a bit less variance than
I do now or a lot less experience
uh the aim was to be on track to be
making 30 000 a year
by that by the end of that second year

[36:16]
by that by the end of that second year
and if I wasn't I would
go and do something else and if I was
then I could continue
uh so kind of started out with that
with yeah with that process in mind

[36:31]
with yeah with that process in mind
um
and yeah just started kind of playing
more
straight away well I took
I had the summer after University uh
where I took like some time off and just

[36:45]
where I took like some time off and just
played for fun but then after that
started trying to play a bit more
I love this I love you graduated
University and you sit down with your
parents and have a very strategic career
path and podcast I popped up for two
years I can picture or just imagine
myself trying this I would get gonna

[37:00]
myself trying this I would get gonna
laughed out the living room very quickly
and told to apply for jobs without same
night but I really like how your first
of all you've thought of the problems
like the gambling aspect The Addictive
aspects and then you've got clear
metrics of let's give this a go I think
any time you take A New Path it's an

[37:15]
any time you take A New Path it's an
experiment and I really like that your
parents supported this because I know a
lot of people listening well the parents
will understand I know my parents to
this day still don't understand how
pocket works but it's good that your
parents give you kind of some room and
flexibility to go after a Pursuit that
you were clearly interested in so in
terms of these metrics so you're

[37:30]
terms of these metrics so you're
basically working towards hopefully
being on track to make 30 000 by the end
of a second yeah were your parents
checking in with you throughout that
process and how do you take off on that
Pursuit what were the kind of initial
kind of strategies to try and make that
money
uh

[37:45]
uh I mean they they weren't checking in
in terms of you know I didn't have to
report to them they were checking in
just because I have a close relationship
with my parents so I was talking to them
about it uh I think in terms of them
being supportive yeah I was very lucky
because I know a lot of friends whose

[38:01]
because I know a lot of friends whose
parents were either
completely apathetic or
in some cases the complete opposite of
supportive you know up to some people's
parents almost trying to forbid it

[38:15]
parents almost trying to forbid it
so I was lucky with that but my parents
kind of said you know you
uh
I did my degree I focused on that
and I got the grades in it at a tough
degree at a tough University and they
said you know you've you've done that

[38:31]
said you know you've you've done that
and now you're 21. it's not really our
place anymore to have
any saying that like they recommended
University because they thought it was a
good idea and when you know you have to
choose when you're 17 so you're still
not fully

[38:45]
not fully
an adult and it makes sense I think to
have a lot of your parents input at that
point and listen to people's advice
once you've done that and you're 21
they're like you know you have this
degree you can do whatever you want with

[39:00]
degree you can do whatever you want with
it and we'll support that but you're an
adult now we can't
it's not a place to tell you that we
think
a different job is better
um
you know up until the point where they
said if you do it for two years and you
make no money or lose money

[39:17]
make no money or lose money
then again we can't
make you do anything but we would
suggest that maybe this isn't the way to
go
uh in terms of how I started I guess
yeah it was pretty slow it start at the

[39:31]
yeah it was pretty slow it start at the
start I was just playing the same games
I had at University and slightly higher
uh and doing like fine not amazing
um and then got quite lucky I think so I
joined a Skype group that was uh

[39:48]
joined a Skype group that was uh
from our University of like people who
were in the same position like either
just graduated or at the University or
coming to the university
and Charlie Carroll was in it

[40:02]
and Charlie Carroll was in it
um and
he
just won the Sunday million I think
and he was about to go to the university
so
I think after a year off so he was like

[40:16]
I think after a year off so he was like
I think he's two years younger than me
[Music]
um
and
he said
I'm going to Amsterdam to celebrate this
anybody in this group who wants to come

[40:31]
anybody in this group who wants to come
you're welcome to come
and
at the time
uh I was
just playing poker and not really doing

[40:45]
just playing poker and not really doing
anything and I was like okay sure I'll
go meet some local people
uh
and then yeah we got on very well there
and ended up renting like a flat for six
months in London about three weeks after
that trip

[41:02]
that trip
and you know he was already doing quite
well he was already playing
like five ten online and had just won
the Sunday million
so that's where things started improving
a lot and I was like quite lucky to find

[41:17]
a lot and I was like quite lucky to find
someone
it was naturally
more intuitive at it than me I think now
and even then like I understood poker
well when someone
explains some things to me but there

[41:31]
explains some things to me but there
were things I was definitely getting
stuck at on my own
um and even now I find it a lot easier
now with the solvers like the solver era
for me is just a
place
that makes more sense to how my brain

[41:46]
that makes more sense to how my brain
thinks about the game
at the time there was a lot more kind of
tuition and intuition and like leveling
and
I was less good at that I think
so
things started improving a lot faster

[42:01]
things started improving a lot faster
when I had uh Charlie helping with
uh
yeah with how I played
yeah how long were you live with Charlie
and what were some of the kind of
progressions you made in that time span

[42:15]
progressions you made in that time span
um
we lived in
I don't remember exactly the timeline
but we rented that flat in London for
six months which I think was would have
been about like nine months after I left
University
and then

[42:31]
and then
I can't remember maybe I went home for a
couple of months and then we rented a
flat in Cambridge after that for six
months but ended up giving that one up
because I think we rented it for six
months and we're in the flat for about
five weeks because we started traveling
to some of the live stuff

[42:45]
to some of the live stuff
so we realized that you know there
wasn't much point in paying for this
place we were never at uh
uh yeah I think it's hard to say with
like progress at the time because it was
a lot of ups and downs where you know I
was playing

[43:01]
was playing
five cent Ten Cent Zoom maybe at the
time when I met Charlie and
by the end of the six months I was like
shot taking 102 like uh sorry one two
Zoom so 200 right now

[43:16]
Zoom so 200 right now
but
I'm not sure even when I look back I
never really stopped a stake to see
whether I was like winning
and like I didn't ever do a six months
ago I'm gonna grind this steak and just
make money

[43:30]
make money
uh Charlie was very aggressive with
moving up and I just did the same so it
was kind of whenever I have 20 buy-ins
for the next stake I move up
and then if I lose two or three I move
back down so it's hard to say even now
like you know I was short taking 200 but

[43:47]
like you know I was short taking 200 but
it could have just been a good run I'm
not sure like which stake I should have
actually been at
um but yeah at the time I think we both
enjoyed doing that because it felt

[44:00]
enjoyed doing that because it felt
it's almost like a free roll at that
time I'm just like okay I have two years
to try this and
we're having fun playing so
we just like win some money lose some
money and just like keep playing trying
to get better but it was basically what

[44:16]
to get better but it was basically what
we did I think for those six months it
was just a mix of playing online
uh online Zoom online tournaments and
then we rented a flat near the Grosvenor
like the the Vic in London
so

[44:31]
so
obviously because like when you're
playing small stake Zoom you can play
like 10 cent 25 cent Zoom but you can
beat one three live so it's like a
pretty good way to make some money as
well to play the live cash games so uh
yeah so I guess

[44:47]
yeah so I guess
progress wise I don't know about
steaks I would say I was probably
beating 100 and out at the end of the
six months
um but it was more just kind of learning
how
to think about the game more

[45:02]
to think about the game more
um
yeah yeah the stage of sounds like
you've got very aggressive bankroll
management you're enjoying the game
you're learning and you're busy is going
as high as you can in a short span of
time to see where your Killer level is
without really stopping to check what

[45:16]
without really stopping to check what
your current win rate is or exactly
where you should be in terms of like
playing lives it sounds like around this
time a little bit moving to close to a
casino and you potentially started
playing more live around that time I
think you mentioned that you were only
in your apartment or flat for five weeks

[45:30]
in your apartment or flat for five weeks
of the six months to some of you like
when you start transitioning to live and
how about you sort of uh judge in which
games were most profitable in terms of
your online grind compared to the live
sessions you are playing
uh

[45:45]
I'm not sure about yeah again like the
exact timelines I'm not sure I guess I
could check Hendon or something I know
that
uh the first few because I was still
playing a lot smaller than Charlie the
first few trips we went on was just
Charlie winning satellites to ebts and

[46:01]
Charlie winning satellites to ebts and
then me just like going along and
sharing the room and playing some of the
smaller stake stuff
uh
I can't vouch for him but for me and I
think for both of us it wasn't quite as

[46:15]
think for both of us it wasn't quite as
like
calculated us now like now when I look
at stuff I'm trying to work out how much
I make per hour and day on the trips
like which are the best trips to go to
if I only want to travel four or five
months a year which ones I should skip

[46:30]
months a year which ones I should skip
uh
and you know that's kind of a
combination of what works best for my
personal life and then which ones I earn
more and you know how much I'm willing
to give up
uh at the time I honestly think it was

[46:45]
uh at the time I honestly think it was
a lot more just kind of fun you know
because it's still like I said it didn't
really feel like a job so it's just like
oh we play online when we feel like
we've been in the house for too many
days in a row we go and play live
when

[47:01]
when
one of us wins a package to an EBT
we
go and like you know I think Charlie won
the first one to San Remo and it wasn't
really like oh is this more profitable
than staying here it was just like oh we
can go to Italy and play poker where

[47:15]
can go to Italy and play poker where
we've like never traveled for poker
before that sounds great
uh it wasn't really like is my hourly
higher there than here uh it was just
like let's go and have a holiday in
Italy with some poker involved
yeah just go on the Vlog enjoying the

[47:30]
yeah just go on the Vlog enjoying the
experience of playing poker being able
to travel I know it's like seeing where
it leads you there's no like clear kind
of part of that stage it's just
enjoyment based curiosity and wherever
the satellites would take you so to
speak would be the next gonna livestock
so let's get back from the PCA right
recently but there was a time earlier in

[47:46]
recently but there was a time earlier in
your career where you ended up almost
going broke or losing most of your role
in The Bahamas so sorry first of all how
you ended up there in your career and
what can unfolded for you to uh got a
bit of a downswing when you're there
uh

[48:00]
uh
I think it was the same thing I think
Charlie won a package and I went
uh
with him and
I
can't remember the exact timing but I

[48:16]
can't remember the exact timing but I
had like 20K I think
and
obviously they were just expenses
uh you know like flights there aren't
cheap uh food there is not cheap
and then just like the online stuff

[48:30]
and then just like the online stuff
we're just like very aggressive with
bankroll stuff so
I was
entering tournaments sometimes and like
keeping pieces of myself where I maybe
had 15 lions for that level when it's

[48:46]
had 15 lions for that level when it's
like a 800 person appointment
uh because we kind of just had the thing
of
I was making money
in like live cash in London and was
making money online in cash

[49:01]
making money online in cash
and was just like oh I'll just enter
this tournament with 15 buttons
if I win great that speeds things up and
I have more money if I lose I'll just go
back to what I was doing at home which
I'm enjoying so like

[49:16]
I'm enjoying so like
it didn't really matter that much to me
so I think it basically was just that I
just went
play a bunch of tournaments I wasn't
rolled for
lost them all
and came back with
little to no money
and then

[49:30]
and then
just went yeah I mean nothing nothing
really changed it's like just went back
to playing the same games online but
with less money
uh at the time it didn't matter it was
just like
there wasn't much I I think it I think

[49:45]
there wasn't much I I think it I think
at this point I was back to living with
my parents like we'd given up the flat
in Cambridge
and I went back to my parents house was
like lucky that they had a place that I
could stay so you know took the pressure
off
why a lot of people would have I've read
issues

[50:01]
issues
so my living expenses were like very low
and yeah I was like lucky enough to be
in a situation where I could do that and
just go and
lose my role and then come and know I or

[50:16]
lose my role and then come and know I or
not know but hope I could make it back
in some of the games I think that's the
nice thing about Poco is once you get to
a certain level
there are games you can just move down
to and make a lot of money especially if
you're at a time like that where you're
willing to just play 60 hours a week

[50:32]
willing to just play 60 hours a week
you know if you're
if you're at the lowest Stakes that's
not true but if you're 100 or 200 now
you can move down to one below Play 60

[50:45]
you can move down to one below Play 60
hours a week and make decent money
um so I think that took a lot of
pressure off and it was still just
a learning thing and
you know with the opportunity to think
something

[51:00]
something
yeah I think it's very interesting that
you had this very relaxed relationship
with your role obviously like you said
you're young you can build it back you
had online games which you could grind
and make a profits at the same time I'm
guessing you'd put a decent amount of
work into building Your Role to 20K and

[51:15]
work into building Your Role to 20K and
it's probably not nice to go to a nice
trip to the Bahamas and come back with
most of your role gone it takes quite a
bit of humbleness to just go about the
grinding not not worry about it and just
get on with rebuilding Your Role so in
terms of like you mentioned in the
questionnaire we sent you uh that you're
a little bit of a gambler at heart we

[51:31]
a little bit of a gambler at heart we
can see like with your bankroll
management you've been like quite
aggressive it's your taken one of the
ways you feel like being aggressive with
your bankroll has helped you I'm
guessing like little mistakes in one of
them there's been any times where you're
aggressive Banker management or risk
taken overall has come back to bite you

[51:45]
taken overall has come back to bite you
so to speak
uh
yeah I mean I think
I was probably slightly
less aggressive at the start but Charlie

[52:00]
less aggressive at the start but Charlie
was very aggressive and we were kind of
learning poker together me from like he
was teaching me a lot and then we were
going on these trips together and
I was just
doing the same as him in terms of just

[52:16]
doing the same as him in terms of just
being that aggressive uh
[Music]
I think I'm almost more aggressive in
gambling
outside of Poker in terms of Investments
I am kind of more willing to fire big on

[52:31]
I am kind of more willing to fire big on
than poker sometimes uh especially
now maybe just because I know so I know
more about proper now and know how it
can go
um
I think

[52:47]
I don't know if I ever had any really
bad experiences with with taking too
much I mean
overall I would say it was much more of
a positive than a negative in the end
not endorsing or saying like I recommend

[53:01]
not endorsing or saying like I recommend
it for everyone just in my personal
experience in hindsight I think it was
positive because things ended well
and I think it was a very quick way to
learn certain things like if you want to
play the high stakes games you have to

[53:16]
play the high stakes games you have to
be okay with losing money because
even if you're not
uh like now if when I play the 250ks
it's not all my money like if I lose I
don't lose 250 of my own money but
you're still losing 250k of yours and

[53:30]
you're still losing 250k of yours and
someone else's money and it's like a
house and you have to be
detached
a certain extent from losing money
otherwise you just couldn't perform well
in those games and I think
having that very Sweeney start where I
lost all of my money multiple times

[53:47]
lost all of my money multiple times
helped develop that quite quickly which
I think you need to play the higher
Stakes
uh
I think
maybe the only time that I really felt
it a bit too much was in Barcelona one

[54:01]
it a bit too much was in Barcelona one
year when I had 100K at this point and I
think I lost 50k in the first five days
uh uh where I think I lost 35k in the
50k tournament with like myself and

[54:16]
50k tournament with like myself and
swaps where I just swap with two people
and we all fired three times
so even though like I only had
you know
15 of myself and
seven and a half percent of them or
something but we all just buy it

[54:32]
something but we all just buy it
multiple times and all go crushed and
you know it's looking back it's
questionable whether I should have even
been playing those Stakes at that time
and then I lost the main event and a
side event and was just like wait I had
100K now I have 55 days later and I

[54:46]
100K now I have 55 days later and I
still have six days of Poker left to
play uh that was I think the only time
where I felt
a little like
physically worried about losing a lot I
think at the beginning

[55:01]
think at the beginning
you know I got to like five or six K
before and lost it all I got to 20K and
lost it all but I'd always been like oh
that's not really enough money to
uh
play the games I want to so at some
point I need to build it any more anyway

[55:15]
point I need to build it any more anyway
so I might as well take a shot and then
see but 100K was enough to do a lot of
things with impog and outside of Poker
and losing half of it and knowing that
the rest might be lost in the next five
days was not that fun
okay in hindsight I think it was like a

[55:32]
okay in hindsight I think it was like a
good thing because you need to learn
that
you you need to like learn where the
limit is to know
where you can push it and where you
can't
yeah so two follow-up questions from the
Barcelona periods what were some of the
things you did to overcome that kind of

[55:46]
things you did to overcome that kind of
that feeling you had when you last
weekly care and obviously it led some
guessing some soul searching to do of
what am I doing here potentially losing
oil and then how did that change your
behaviors going forward did it leave did
you have to uh lower your kind of risk
exposure the short term amid Tim you

[56:01]
exposure the short term amid Tim you
have to refer some things that changed
as a result of that
uh
yeah I mean I don't think I had any of
the like what am I doing here or why am
I playing it was kind of obvious to me
what had happened because most of the

[56:15]
what had happened because most of the
Lost was from a 50k where I was like I
might not even be winning in it if I am
it's like two or three percent because
I'm one of the I was like still shot
taking those Stakes I'm like best case
I'm not
I'm one of the worst regs in the game

[56:30]
I'm one of the worst regs in the game
and I'll be making very low return why
have I lost 35k chasing two percent
returns when there's like soft two five
and soft one case
so it changed my Approach slightly in
terms of just realizing

[56:46]
you know that even though I want to take
higher States and was used to doing that
online
that those were really high stakes and
you can just get crushed
for a lot of money not like you know
playing 200 Zuma moving up to 500 Zoom

[57:00]
playing 200 Zuma moving up to 500 Zoom
you can just kind of quit after two
buy-ins and you just lost 1K this was
kind of the first time I was like oh I
could actually just go and lose my whole
100K if I'm just like being an idiot
chasing these
really low returns so I think it changed
my Approach slightly in terms of if I

[57:15]
my Approach slightly in terms of if I
wanted to take stuff
uh
not swap a bunch if I
because I you know I would be short
taking up for like experience and
thinking I was winning
so but it still wasn't because I

[57:31]
so but it still wasn't because I
couldn't swap with the best people in
the games either it's like I wasn't uh
I don't think it was the best place to
get a good return of my money and I
didn't need to just fire that much into
it if I wanted a short take I could just

[57:46]
it if I wanted a short take I could just
take a small part of my piece of myself
and
so
but also just stop short taking those
things quite as much at the time
um and then yeah just like Play Just
carried on playing you know the softer

[58:00]
carried on playing you know the softer
stuff just save my money for the mains
where I think I was making
decent Roi and live cash which was like
at the time still just very soft on the
ebts then
um
so yeah like change my Approach slightly

[58:16]
so yeah like change my Approach slightly
in that but I don't think I ever had
like you know should I be playing poker
I was really aware that I thought I
should be playing Poco just not that
poker at that time
yeah so I was like putting your hand at
a hot stove you know Burns you don't

[58:30]
a hot stove you know Burns you don't
need any more lessons from that it's
like that that was a bad idea I
shouldn't have done that yeah it sounds
like it helped you get your risk taking
nature into more of the almost like
creative system safety rails around it
I've been a bit more realistic with how
much risk you can take on in the short
term that's not Reckless it's almost
like that aristic taken Avenue you

[58:46]
like that aristic taken Avenue you
almost need to balance it was so thin so
it doesn't go over the edge it sounds
like this experience helped you to find
oh wait wait a second I don't need to
take these super high variants uh lower
EV spots when there's other spots
available uh yeah maybe don't risk all
my role in one kind of trip so yeah it

[59:01]
my role in one kind of trip so yeah it
sounds like it created a little bit of a
balancer for you so I'm interested to
know what you mentioned you were like
playing the high rollers being detached
different results so I'm curious to know
how someone becomes the touch from
results so that's the open to 50K and
back in those days are you playing the
250k in these days how does one begin to

[59:19]
250k in these days how does one begin to
remove their mind from thinking about
the monetary value all right because
it's very I know for yourself you
probably it's very very easy to think oh
yeah it's detached from results but from
listeners watching they'll be like well
if I sat down at 50K by regardless if

[59:30]
if I sat down at 50K by regardless if
it's my money or someone else's or a mix
of both there's a lot of money on the
line that's really hard for the mind not
to gravitate towards that so for
yourself when you naturally quite good
at separating the strategy game from the
financial bargain or was there some kind
of is there anything you do to uh allow

[59:45]
of is there anything you do to uh allow
yourself to uh not be attached to the
monetary values of the the big high
quality player
I mean I think at the beginning I
actually wasn't good at it I I don't
really know what the Baseline is or what
the average
person has with respect to that but I

[1:00:00]
person has with respect to that but I
was I remember being not good at Zoom I
remember always like playing Forte was a
zoom and just kind of like losing a
three-bed pot and checking my balance
like you know like seeing how the
session is going all the time when I
would never do that now and it shouldn't
matter

[1:00:15]
matter
uh
I think a lot of it for me was just
experience just it just happens so much
that you just kind of
gradually get used to it like you know

[1:00:31]
gradually get used to it like you know
when I was first playing
five cents 10 cents Zoom if I lost ten
dollars I would be really annoyed but
then like when you're playing
100 I know losing ten dollars doesn't
annoy you anymore and I think that just
like happens naturally throughout the

[1:00:45]
like happens naturally throughout the
stakes and then once you've been at a
certain state for long enough you just
know it that's how it works
um with the biggest stuff
I think
playing it a lot helps
um you're generally around a lot of

[1:01:00]
um you're generally around a lot of
people who also view it the same way
it's just like you're playing
tough people and losing is part of it
um
you know everyone or most people treat
it like that and then
for me
like selling action when

[1:01:18]
like selling action when
I do for the big games
having people who also treat it like
that as investors because there are some
investors that I sold to in the past
who

[1:01:30]
who
actually I I mean I've had some bad
experiences but not as many but I've had
friends who have like played a bad hand
in games and then been asked for the
money back from the investors
because and it was usually from like
people they didn't know that well people
selling on Facebook or

[1:01:46]
selling on Facebook or
you know people who aren't like poker
Pros themselves Maybe
and people like oh I invested in you
because I thought you were good but you
like you played this like bad hand in my
view can I have my money back because I
was like
I didn't want to invest in you if you

[1:02:00]
I didn't want to invest in you if you
play like that
uh and I think obviously like that's the
extreme but the other extreme is having
people who really don't care and who are
just like
I think you're gonna poke her that
doesn't mean you won't make mistakes and

[1:02:16]
doesn't mean you won't make mistakes and
you can either lose because of luck or
you can lose because you made a mistake
and that's just how poker is and I don't
care so like here's the money and I'm
never gonna
talk to you about it again
um so I think for the like higher Stakes
that helps as well because that really

[1:02:31]
that helps as well because that really
takes the pressure off where you don't
feel like oh If I Lose I'm gonna have to
you know explain to this person why I
lost or explain to this person that like
sorry but you know I don't have the
money for you and you know I'm sorry if
that's a big deal for you

[1:02:46]
that's a big deal for you
yes I've got a few things there from
that one was the exporter itself playing
the games more frequently almost like
building a tolerance for playing certain
games all of a sudden it becomes the
norm so to speak obviously I'm guessing
some of the high rollers and the super
high rollers it's hard to build enough

[1:03:00]
high rollers it's hard to build enough
of a sample and some of those sticks to
kind of get that feeling but over time
like exposing yourself to with the same
stimulus in terms of buy-in or whatever
time you get used to it becomes like
normalized so to speak and the second
thing you mentioned was that I can
invest as mindsets where most of people
go around are similar in terms of their

[1:03:16]
go around are similar in terms of their
they treat each buying as Investments
then you've got other people buying
action it will also investing in your
career or your your tournaments and
again they treat it like uh yeah an
investment sort of mindset so they know
all the risk involved and they're not
expecting like returns you've got this
around other people who are also uh yeah

[1:03:31]
around other people who are also uh yeah
similar minded and then you've got other
people from the outside who might be
investing who are basically uh allowing
you to uh just play poker without the
pressure I'm interested to know if you
have a different scorecards that you
keep track of because I'm thinking if
someone's trying to touch themselves on
results it's quite hard when the results

[1:03:46]
results it's quite hard when the results
are very big so Excel let's say you're
only going to play a handful of 100ks or
250ks in a year and let's say you have a
good way to lose all those they're going
bad variants in those games if the
scorecard was just Financial there's a
very good chance that you could be yeah

[1:04:00]
very good chance that you could be yeah
losing that yeah so to speak so I'm
wondering for yourself like when you do
play the higher volumes overall when you
play in your career do you have a
different scorecard something that you
judge your Performance Based on which
isn't
um a monetary metric or a results metric
uh

[1:04:15]
uh
yeah I mean it is hard to not have the
money thing at all because that is you
know the kind of
first thing you see in your results and
if you just never won you would have to
stop playing
um
other than that

[1:04:34]
I mean you and you do have to look at
that because there are certain things
where you know you need to know
which games you're playing what you
think your Roi is and how many games
you're playing and what your wins and
losses are because there is a certain

[1:04:45]
losses are because there is a certain
point where maybe you're
like
losing so much over a certain amount of
games that you're likely just not
winning in those you do you know you
can't just say
like the aim is to be detached

[1:05:00]
like the aim is to be detached
for money in the sense that emotionally
you don't want to be thinking about the
money when you're playing but you can't
detach and just never look at it because
that is what tells you whether you're
winning or not
um
the other things I think is just kind of
generally have a feel maybe for how I'm

[1:05:15]
generally have a feel maybe for how I'm
playing and if I'm getting better in
terms of when you review just like how
many big mistakes you make
um
and then
I guess people you play with as well
like you know

[1:05:30]
like you know
people that you can swap with maybe
change
uh
people who will invest in you the markup
you offered
for games or like how easy it is to sell
you know ahead times in the past where

[1:05:46]
you know ahead times in the past where
when I was first playing high rollers
and you're like I wanted to sell action
and you're selling like five percent of
the time to some people who
maybe know you or maybe just want like a
little sweat even if they don't know
much about your Pokemon

[1:06:01]
much about your Pokemon
and then
I've had you know and it was like hard
where you're kind of thinking okay I
want to keep 20 of myself and I've now
sold
12 people between 1 and 10 and that's
like
quite tough so you you know maybe

[1:06:16]
quite tough so you you know maybe
sometimes you didn't sell enough and you
couldn't play and then I've had times
where
once I had got a lot better I wanted to
play 100k
and
have been offered like 350 of the action
into your like then having to choose who

[1:06:31]
into your like then having to choose who
you sell it to
uh
and
some of the people that
I sell to are like
also players so I think there are like
various things like that in how I think

[1:06:46]
various things like that in how I think
I'm playing and how other people think
I'm playing there is quite a good
metric to go off even though it's I mean
maybe metrics the wrong word it's not
like measurable in any sense
um

[1:07:00]
um
but yeah I think just like feeling like
I'm improving
um
is
how I judge most of my kind of how I
feel about my poker progress
yeah yeah I think that's quite a lot of
data points that you're using there

[1:07:15]
data points that you're using there
rather than just results like I said to
some degree the results are always the
end goal of what matters and you can't
switch off from that from According to
perspective but the emotional side I
think is a more important variable how
do you almost like keep confidence
during bad patches and results are not
going your way so you have a lot of

[1:07:30]
going your way so you have a lot of
different data points whether it's how
you feel about the games it's other
people around you having confidence in
your game you know the selection to
people who trust your game see I think
those things help to build confidence
let's say uh you want to buy a drone and
let's say uh you didn't have those data

[1:07:45]
let's say uh you didn't have those data
points to look back on let's say you
played a bad tournament so to speak it
was lots of mistakes and the money
values were going in the whole sort of
speaking on a diamond swing how do you
feel like you would deal with that
emotionally is anything anything you
would go to or if you were a bit worried
about your performance in some of the
higher games is there anything you would

[1:08:00]
higher games is there anything you would
do to kind of get yourself out of that
situation
uh yeah I think I think it was 2018 was
very bad for me in terms of
money and
at the end of the year I just didn't
think I was playing well I was like

[1:08:16]
think I was playing well I was like
playing the high stakes more regularly
and kind of
it's hard to say because I haven't been
playing them as much so I was still like
more attached to the results but
I felt like maybe I shouldn't be playing

[1:08:31]
I felt like maybe I shouldn't be playing
those games or wasn't as good as I
thought I was wasn't as high up in the
games I thought and could feel that like
I lost a lot of money and played some
hands I was like okay this wasn't
like when I reviewed them it was like
this is too many mistakes compared to I

[1:08:45]
this is too many mistakes compared to I
think what other people are doing in
those games
uh
so I just took three months off playing
and just studying six days a week
oh
and just didn't go on any live stops I
think I did like February March
April of that year and then

[1:09:03]
yeah I mean I must be getting the date
strong
or maybe but uh I could check on hinder
maybe but um that was before Vegas 2019

[1:09:15]
maybe but um that was before Vegas 2019
so yeah it would have been a few months
at the start of that year
um and I think that like that is
for me all I can really do in those
situations emotionally it's nice to give
yourself a break because losing and

[1:09:31]
yourself a break because losing and
feeling like you're making mistakes is
getting stressful to lose money
and then for me it's more stressful than
the money to be making mistakes and
stuff because I'm just competitive and
didn't want to be not playing well
so it's nice to give your brain a reset

[1:09:47]
so it's nice to give your brain a reset
because I think there's just a only a
certain amount of that stress you can
take before you just burn out
emotionally
and then
you know at the end of the day if you're
not playing well
or you think you're not
a big enough winner in your games to

[1:10:02]
a big enough winner in your games to
make it worth it like the time and the
gambling
the only like long-term solution is get
better so
I was just like either I can keep
playing and postponing they're getting

[1:10:15]
playing and postponing they're getting
better or do it really slowly and
probably have more pain or I can just go
away hopefully turn my like two percent
ROI into six percent or something and
then come back when it's six rather than
trying to grind it from like two to six
whilst playing

[1:10:30]
whilst playing
uh so I think like if I had the same now
that's
I would just do the same stuff I mean
in between now if I have a trip I don't
think I play that well on
I just go home and

[1:10:46]
I just go home and
study more hours than usual
um
yeah perfect this was it this was the
skill I was looking for because I knew
you must have something in place that
balances the kind of playing the high
rollers taking a lot of risk that when
things don't go well and you feel a

[1:11:01]
things don't go well and you feel a
little bit out of your depth or your
game doesn't feel quite a shot because
you wanted to be there must be something
you fall back on to get you through
those patches that's very adaptive and
for you it's this kind of remove
yourself from the games in that example
you spend three months studying and I
like the kind of Simplicity of just get

[1:11:16]
like the kind of Simplicity of just get
better I just gotta get better and I
really I can tell for myself you've got
a good intuitive feel at least you trust
your feels and in those moments rather
than the lose I'm sure the losing was
paintball Rose more like you felt that
you were making more mistakes than you
should have been and that created the
pain points in their pain points LED you

[1:11:31]
pain points in their pain points LED you
to go right I need to study more I need
to work on my game I'm gonna stop
playing those games for a periods and
come back a better version myself and
that's the key ingredient where it's
almost like if I'm not good enough now
I'll get better and come back again so
it's like this ability to uh navigate
your space in terms of it's not an

[1:11:46]
your space in terms of it's not an
absolute like I said the games are too
tough for that period of the world wins
but then you just got better and I think
that's the yeah the kind of key
ingredient that allows you to keep
coming back and playing these high
stakes when other players might crumble
and results won't go on their way
all right I was just gonna say quickly I

[1:12:02]
all right I was just gonna say quickly I
think like switching
maybe like short term
like short
term past experiences
to

[1:12:17]
uh
to be put like fully in the past quickly
is very useful in those just like if you
were losing even if it was for an
extended period of time and you were
losing for six months
it's very hard to put that behind you

[1:12:31]
it's very hard to put that behind you
uh or for me it used to be a lot harder
but I think seeing things is just like
okay that happened in the past and now
like the only thing I have to choose is
then future year
uh and like separating those very

[1:12:46]
uh and like separating those very
quickly it's being like okay yeah maybe
I shouldn't have been playing those
games the last six months
do I want to play them the next six
months and what do I have to do to make
that not a bad decision and then like
forget about the six months where you
shouldn't have done and just been like
hey that was a mistake I made in the
past and I just

[1:13:00]
past and I just
can be like a different person now
how do you move on quickly in those
scenarios because I don't understand how
that skills that is at the same time I
know a lot of people struggle with the
story narrative let's say about six
months that six months creates a little

[1:13:15]
months that six months creates a little
bit of a repetitive story of why they do
this it's going badly is things going to
turn around how do you like almost like
draw a line and cut that story off and
be very present oriented in future
oriented is there anything any skills
you've developed to help you or kind of
seek forward rather than looking back
uh

[1:13:31]
uh
I guess it would just be the same that I
said before just like changing habits if
you feel like
you know you're losing and you don't
want to be just do something different I
guess so that you don't feel like you're
doing the same thing because I think

[1:13:45]
doing the same thing because I think
that's the for me that's the scary thing
with the gambling where
you know there's no one to stop you in
poco there's no person who's gonna come
and be like hey you lost half your role
like stop like maybe you have friends

[1:14:00]
like stop like maybe you have friends
that do that but a lot of people don't
or maybe you don't want to tell people
and it's scary knowing that like if you
carry on the same you could just lose
everything
uh so I think
I don't know about other people but for
me that is one of the

[1:14:15]
me that is one of the
worries in those situations
so I would just do that and just okay
I'm losing I'm just gonna
change my habits completely so I don't
feel like I'm in the same narrative like
I'm gonna
study really hard and then come back and
play slightly lower games or take

[1:14:32]
play slightly lower games or take
slightly bigger pieces until I feel
confident again
uh
and
yeah I think the same thing like in the
past
if I was if I had habits on trips that I

[1:14:48]
if I was if I had habits on trips that I
thought weren't helping and
you know at some point you just say okay
I'm not gonna do that anymore and I
think that helps me personally move on
quite quickly because as soon as you cut

[1:15:00]
quite quickly because as soon as you cut
that thing out that you think was
negatively affecting you
you feel different quite quickly you
feel like oh I'm not I'm not doing the
same thing so it's but this is like a
different
set now it's not like a continuation of
the same sample it's just like those

[1:15:15]
the same sample it's just like those
thousand games were I was doing that and
like these next thousand games I'm going
to do something different so it's like a
new slate
I love that it's like create a new
identity it's almost like the old
version of me like these habits and was
getting these results he's gone now and
this new version of me he shows up this

[1:15:30]
this new version of me he shows up this
way it's very action orientated it's
almost like taking back control in that
moment and just go right well what can I
do to change my path from here and then
not getting caught up in the old
narratives I think that's such a huge
huge skill set that you've developed or
always able to have to be able to create

[1:15:45]
always able to have to be able to create
a new version of yourself just by change
your habits change now you're showing up
where I think a lot of people struggle
because they hold on to their old
patterns in terms of the habits but also
the stories they tell themselves they
create a narrative that's six months
that you've just easily moved on from
someone else is telling myself that
story for oh yeah two years three years

[1:16:00]
story for oh yeah two years three years
that six months becomes a four-year
narrative whereas for you you can
quickly see wait a second if I keep
acting the way it was then maybe that's
true but if I change the way I'm showing
up I study harder I level up myself I'm
gonna get different outcomes so I can
just draw a lion and massage so to speak

[1:16:15]
just draw a lion and massage so to speak
and going forwards I'm going to be a
different get a different results going
forward so yeah really really healthy I
think it's a huge mindset

[1:18:17]
in your poker career but for now without
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode
all right ready for yourself do you are
you able to uh lead bad results in the
past and create a positive perspective
going forward or do you struggle with

[1:18:30]
going forward or do you struggle with
any periods of bad results
actually I can really relate to what Ben
says and especially the last point that
you touched on right like okay you maybe
were doing certain things this is like I
think the positive thing that you get

[1:18:45]
think the positive thing that you get
from learning from mistakes let's say
you see that you made some punts here
and there right you don't feel
exceptionally great about it but if you
understand why you did it's like ah I'm
clearly playing from like a wrong frame
of mind these things that I just did for
example were unnecessary I understand

[1:19:00]
example were unnecessary I understand
the flawed reasoning behind it because
you know uh if I thought for myself
personally actually because I'm going
through something very similar at the
moment where I feel like I'm
trying to force things a little bit too
much I'm trying to I think that's how

[1:19:15]
much I'm trying to I think that's how
out of my analysis it came and trying to
use poker as showing a way that I can be
great okay or that I can be something
Superior and then I start to make all
kind of fancy plays okay that's kind of
the origin so if I let me see looking
back at my database and see that I made

[1:19:31]
back at my database and see that I made
all of the mistakes that are simply
unnecessary I make plays that are
completely unnecessary uh and I
understand the origin I can easily be
like okay that was
not it's kind of almost like that you
sort of detach yourself from yourself
you see like okay that was a version of

[1:19:45]
you see like okay that was a version of
me that was in the wrong state of mind
or as you said that had a wrong
strategical approach I now know that I
understand that I'm gonna try to change
certain habits so that I'm in a better
state of playing so I prevent making
these mistakes right or maybe there was
a flaw in how I approach things
strategically or how I fought about the

[1:20:01]
strategically or how I fought about the
scenario if I now change that it almost
looks like indeed it's a it's sort of a
clean slate form so why would I get the
same results if I know why those results
were coming that way because I did
something wrong and if I'm doing
everything in my power to in the future

[1:20:16]
everything in my power to in the future
change those things then I can be
naturally positive or I can feel excited
and positive about the road going
forward and I think throughout your
poker career you constantly reinvent
yourself in those ways right and usually

[1:20:32]
yourself in those ways right and usually
through downswings right this is like
the silver lining of downswings uh
something is extremely interesting that
he pointed uh that band pointed out as
well well I thought it was interesting
about going broke well usually people
are afraid of going broke right and

[1:20:45]
are afraid of going broke right and
losing everything well you in the
beginning went broke multiple times and
realized that you were still okay right
you could make it back so I guess then
if the fear that a lot of people have is
going broke and you went broke and you
felt fine quote quote uh then like worst

[1:21:00]
felt fine quote quote uh then like worst
case never gone broke it's not so scary
anymore so then I guess you're more
willing to take on risk and I love the
way you talked about how it was almost a
free roll and in my in my playlist
there's one song that sometimes comes up
I don't know I haven't done Shuffle and

[1:21:16]
I don't know I haven't done Shuffle and
it's a playlist at least on Spotify and
in that song like I usually don't like
to listen to uh songs where people talk
but in the song there's only a guy that
says what if you feel and then the other
guy says well what if you don't what if
you fly and that's what kind of that's

[1:21:32]
you fly and that's what kind of that's
what I have to think about it's like the
aggressive approach is like a free row
approach like many people like oh no but
if I do this I can lose everything I can
go broke I can fill but you have a very
positive outlook on things well what if
I don't feel you know what if I fly what

[1:21:46]
I don't feel you know what if I fly what
what if I what if I can make this shot
work right then I can suddenly play X
the steak
right it's very that positive outlook
that I think uh
uh is is really really beneficial for
you also confidence is something that I

[1:22:02]
you also confidence is something that I
mean there's a lot of confidence in you
because worst case scenario you can
handle which is going broke you know
that past results don't always equal
future results right because you are in
control you you know that you have the
capability to in this case study your

[1:22:16]
capability to in this case study your
game uh come up with better strategies
and know that different results uh will
come going forward right you have a lot
of that confidence where do you think
that comes from is that purely from your
your ability or
I mean I think

[1:22:32]
I mean I think
just to like clarify with the with the
thing of going broke I was obviously in
a lucky situation where I didn't have
rent to pay uh when I was living with my
parents which some people don't have and
then like broke for me it would be a
different broke someone else because my

[1:22:46]
different broke someone else because my
Baseline expenses are really low uh it
was also at a time where I thought I was
winning at
100 Zoom
so
growing broke was more of like a it

[1:23:02]
growing broke was more of like a it
wasn't ever gonna it didn't ever feel
like it was going to be a permanent
State because I'm like well I know I can
win at 50 Zoom and you can win
15 an hour or something and I'm willing
to work 60 hours a week

[1:23:15]
to work 60 hours a week
and if you're going to work 60 hours a
week you're going to get better and
likely increase that hourly so
it was just like I will go broke for a
short period of time
for the week after I lose these
tournaments but then I will earn enough
to pay

[1:23:31]
to pay
like the you know rent and food and
stuff so I think some of the confidence
was just
knowing that I could beat a game
consistently that would give me enough
money to live
um you know if I was
just starting with poker and was short

[1:23:47]
just starting with poker and was short
taking tournaments and didn't know I
could consistently beat a stake then I
would have to be a lot more cautious
about going broke because
you know that is actually a really
negative outcome where
maybe then you have to stop playing or

[1:24:01]
maybe then you have to stop playing or
maybe it has effects on your life
outside of Poker
so I think obviously like the skill the
skill that has your skill has to be
aligned with the shots that you're
taking obviously right you're not taking
shots in games that you're simply a

[1:24:16]
shots in games that you're simply a
losing player or you're not taking shots
while you are a losing player because
that outcome will always be losing yeah
so it's very important for the listeners
to to indeed take this in consideration

[1:24:30]
to to indeed take this in consideration
right that's kind of I think the point
that that you're making that people
don't get this the wrong way so I think
that's a good uh that's a good thing to
align uh you also mentioned because you
were playing
mainly
uh online cash games when you were

[1:24:46]
uh online cash games when you were
living with Charlie and you guys went
out
to take and you ended up taking very big
shots in live tournaments so this is in
a different format you went from cash
games to tournaments and you went from
the thing that you were used at that
moment online uh to live

[1:25:00]
moment online uh to live
did any did you have any struggles
transitioning from the cash to the
entities or from the online to the live
I mean we were actually playing all four
like I would play
Zoom
in the apartment and then I would play

[1:25:16]
in the apartment and then I would play
Saturdays and Sundays we play
tournaments
and then we'd also play Live cash in the
week in the evenings
at the casino and then we play Live
tournaments traveling like we we were
just playing poker all the time
so it was just like okay Saturdays and

[1:25:31]
so it was just like okay Saturdays and
Sundays are good for tournaments maybe
Thursdays
you know the weekdays are fine just for
Zoom because you can play anytime you
want and then 5 p.m onwards is good for
live cash games because that's when the

[1:25:45]
live cash games because that's when the
casinos get busier so and then yeah when
we could go on the trips we would so we
were just playing all four formats or
like all four main Holdem formats uh
uh I don't
do that anymore and actually don't

[1:26:00]
do that anymore and actually don't
recommend that as well like it people
like coach now I generally say like pick
one I pick one and play that one and you
know you can play online and live of
tournaments or cash but I don't
generally recommend the mixing of
tournaments and cash because

[1:26:17]
tournaments and cash because
I think it's just more competitive these
days and depending on I mean if you're
playing for fun and you're not that
worried about your yearly earnings then
in short like do both if you know that
keeps you entertained and means you're

[1:26:30]
keeps you entertained and means you're
willing to put in more hours and you
don't really care about maximizing your
hourly then go for it I think if you are
looking to play high stakes then you
just need to pick one like
it's at some point people are just very
good and mostly no no completely but

[1:26:49]
good and mostly no no completely but
most of the people are dedicating their
time to one and you will have to compete
against those people if you want to play
the high stakes and you won't do it
playing three days a week of each
yeah you're playing against specialist
right when you reach the higher Stakes

[1:27:01]
right when you reach the higher Stakes
whereas maybe back then there were maybe
many people like you there were maybe
less specialists in the field everyone
was just playing poker and hopping games
I mean I used to do exactly the same
played live play some online clicked the
tournament click the city go click the
cash game yeah

[1:27:16]
cash game yeah
it was it was very Broad and I guess
yeah because of the level of play you're
more allowed to do so was it also
like some approaches to Poker I guess
offer more
natural

[1:27:32]
natural
or it's easier if you have a certain
approach to Poker to transition games
between cash games and tournaments you
also mentioned through I think it was a
mathematic University that you had a
more holistic approach you also
mentioned Charlie being very intuitively

[1:27:46]
mentioned Charlie being very intuitively
good at poker
um
were there was there also a point there
at how he thought to Poker or at least
how he helped you with your poker game
to understand it at a deeper level more
intuitive level that transitioning
between games was a bit easier for you

[1:28:00]
between games was a bit easier for you
or was it purely the the level of play
that made you able to transition in
between games
uh
yeah I mean I think the way that Charlie
thought about poker

[1:28:15]
thought about poker
did make it easier than if I'd learned
some really mechanical approach to one
game
um or some repetitive thing like where
people are just trying to memorize
certain strategies
uh

[1:28:30]
uh
Charlie was much more kind of
it's like higher thought in but maybe
like not much repetitive stuff just like
what do I want to get the person to do
in this exact hand and that was like

[1:28:47]
in this exact hand and that was like
equally relevant to you know tournaments
and cash but there was definitely just
I don't think it was an easy transition
and when I look back I think I was
playing
cash not as well as

[1:29:00]
cash not as well as
anywhere near as well as I could have
been and tournaments not as whether they
could have been because there was just
way too much crossover where you're just
playing like anti-games and no
anti-games like deep stack and short
stack and like stuff just gets you get
like wires crossed stuff like you don't

[1:29:15]
like wires crossed stuff like you don't
specialize in enough
uh
you know I think you see that a lot even
these days when you see cash players
come and play tournaments and you
suddenly put them at 20 bigs
like you were saying with four bad pots
you know like sizes are small and

[1:29:31]
you know like sizes are small and
like there are just Concepts that not
don't exist but are very different to
100 big blind poker
and if you haven't spent a lot of time
playing it you won't have any population
reads on that you won't know

[1:29:46]
reads on that you won't know
like you kind of it's hard to
intuitively grasp like you said how much
to defend versus the small sizes and you
know
if you're jumping between them there's
stuff you're gonna
Miss so I don't even know looking back
whether

[1:30:00]
whether I was successfully transitioning
between the two uh
you know I think over time I got better
at both
but the
the time in my career when I've
progressed the most

[1:30:16]
progressed the most
and
played the higher Stakes has been the
last few years which has been you know
more
or like a kind of single focus on mtts
and you know now I don't play online

[1:30:31]
and you know now I don't play online
and I
almost never play cash like if there are
cash games running sometimes in a live
stop and I
have a few days off I will but like
it's almost never these days so it's

[1:30:45]
it's almost never these days so it's
just playing kind of
uh these small Fields high stakes live
mtts and I think that has been
uh
a kind of different level of progress

[1:31:00]
a kind of different level of progress
for me
what has made you focus mainly on life
instead of playing online why why do you
prefer the live environment the live
stops instead of online
uh I mean I think like I said I I'm I do

[1:31:16]
uh I mean I think like I said I I'm I do
enjoy the gambling
and
online they're like weren't that many
when I was playing before
there weren't that many days where you
could actually get a lot of money on

[1:31:30]
could actually get a lot of money on
in online mtts
you know like a you I was just playing
poker stars a lot and like how much
money can you get on the table in a
random Wednesday
then

[1:31:45]
then
uh so yeah I also had that because I I
feel like I play my best and like really
want to play when there is a lot of
money on the line and if I played lower
Stakes I just like
wouldn't always try my hardest which I
didn't like

[1:32:01]
didn't like
um so you need a certain buy-in sort of
stress in order to kind of make you feel
awake like I can I can imagine a lot of
people would kind of have the opposite
right if you in their comfort zone maybe
in a lower buy-in and they feel like
they can play better and when they would

[1:32:15]
they can play better and when they would
go play a high roll it's just too much
press pressure and they actually their
game kind of crumbles so you kind of
experience the opposite
uh to some extent yeah I mean I don't
really want to play online for like 10
hours in a row for Stakes that don't

[1:32:32]
hours in a row for Stakes that don't
affect me that much
and
uh
also sometimes like the

[1:32:46]
I like the competition like I like
playing against
mostly very tough people so I'm also
like not as much of a fan of the bigger
field stuff
um so I mean sometimes it's a bit
frustrating if you like go and study

[1:33:02]
frustrating if you like go and study
good theory stuff and then you're
playing a bunch of lines that
uh very different
um
I I mean I do enjoy that but I think

[1:33:15]
I I mean I do enjoy that but I think
I would prefer to play more against
tough opponents like I find it just a
bit more
stimulating in terms of the actual game
you ever get intimidated by uh by Top
Field stuff tables or the the better the

[1:33:31]
Field stuff tables or the the better the
opponents the more it puts you in the
zone
uh
I mean
I think a little just in terms of just
there's a lot of money on the line you
know so I don't really want to go and
play a 250k if it's just like

[1:33:46]
play a 250k if it's just like
uh
you know if it's just like Stevie
Makita
um Adamo like
I I would like to play against them and
it's enjoyable but I don't want to go

[1:34:01]
it's enjoyable but I don't want to go
and play Just against those three and
put 250k there because it's a lot of
money
uh so I guess
I don't know yeah I don't think it's
like intimidation more just

[1:34:16]
like intimidation more just
not wanting to gamble for huge amounts
of money for people that are better than
me uh
but you know I I do like playing against
those in the like the Triton
Invitational recently the 200k they did
in Cyprus where the first day is split

[1:34:32]
in Cyprus where the first day is split
so you only play against Pros on the
first day and the businessmen only play
against each other
oh cool I didn't know they did it this
way like I had an amazing like I really
enjoyed that first day because
it's a little weird where there's some

[1:34:46]
it's a little weird where there's some
kind of
you know
weird ICM stuff where you only have a
single re-entry and you do want to make
it to the part of field part of the
drawing where you're not just playing
Pros
um so there is you know it's not like a

[1:35:03]
um so there is you know it's not like a
normal tournament structure and there
are adjustments but
because it's single entry and there's
only eight levels or something you are
effectively just playing
normal day one poker against

[1:35:16]
normal day one poker against
tables of mostly just top pros and that
was
well but while still having the comfort
of knowing you are winning a lot in the
field because it's one pro to one
businessman

[1:35:31]
businessman
so that's kind of like The Best of Both
Worlds where you're like I know I'm
winning in this game
but I get to play this table that is
very tough and play like try and play
very good poker and get put to the test
a lot and like that was one of the days

[1:35:46]
a lot and like that was one of the days
I've had the most fun in a while playing
poker
in the last few years
it's very interesting again it has like
I think if you put me on the table
obviously I'm I'm really skilled but
let's say
a cash game table of some of the best

[1:36:04]
I guess it's the same right if you
increase the money I would feel less
confident if it's at the money budget
that I'm comfortable with I would also
enjoy myself
uh so so I can indeed relate to that how

[1:36:15]
uh so so I can indeed relate to that how
did the obviously you had certain ideas
right you already mentioned ICM wise
obviously busting
uh is a bit more costly as you know that
basically the EV on day two when they
mix the tables is going to be higher uh
or at least that's how I assume it's got

[1:36:31]
or at least that's how I assume it's got
It's going to work how did you notice it
changed the game you had probably have
certain ideas about strategies going in
right oh wait this actually changed the
game how in practice did you see the
game changing because of the way they

[1:36:45]
game changing because of the way they
set this up
I mean I think slightly less
than maybe you'd expect because firstly
single entry so it's not like a freeze
out where you know it's single entry
over eight levels where I think we
started
to

[1:37:00]
to
can't remember but somewhere between 204
200 and 400 big Lanes deep you start
so you're starting very deep and you
play eight levels where
your
I can't remember but the last level of

[1:37:15]
I can't remember but the last level of
the day is between like 50 and 80 big
blinds so
you're playing 200 hands of 75 to 300
big blind poker it's not
like it you're that
likely to fire two anyway

[1:37:30]
likely to fire two anyway
so
and then you know
there are some people I think that have
different views on that because
if you

[1:37:46]
if you make chips in that you also have
more often that you get to play for
longer when the fields join because you
just have a bigger stack
so why I think there is ICM there were
definitely differing viewpoints and you

[1:38:00]
definitely differing viewpoints and you
do have to be careful of you don't know
who in the field has those views and you
don't want to just like get run over by
someone who's playing
crazy or like someone who's trying to
take advantage of the fact that people
are trying to yeah exactly let's go

[1:38:17]
are trying to yeah exactly let's go
through my mind like if if everyone
wants to make day two then obviously
you're going to play hyper aggressive
right but yeah it's it's indeed yeah
it's interesting so then you go try to
look out for okay obviously you have a
very good idea of what uh what what the

[1:38:32]
very good idea of what uh what what the
theory Baseline would be for certain
hands certain place uh so if you see
certain showdowns that you would say
okay this is this guy's clearly pushing
it this is over the line you could make
an assumption that this is his approach
which you could use that information to

[1:38:46]
which you could use that information to
to lighten up a little bit in the past
in the future
yeah I mean I think there were just
not huge adjustments because I think
anytime if you make a really big
adjustment like that on day one where
you're like oh I'm just not gonna three

[1:39:01]
you're like oh I'm just not gonna three
bet like you're playing as people who
are good enough and aware enough to
notice that and then you're strategy
just loses so much GB that you don't
actually gain what you want to uh
so and then yeah I think because it's
single re-entry and so the the average

[1:39:17]
single re-entry and so the the average
bullets isn't that high anyway so I
don't think they were like
huge changes and then it's also just
really hard for me to
for me to see because you're playing 200

[1:39:32]
for me to see because you're playing 200
hands and most of them not on Stream So
and even if they are on stream I can't
tell I'm like okay so I saw this guy get
Jack Knight suited once and it's going
to be 53 about 50 cool and he called
like that doesn't yeah doesn't say

[1:39:45]
like that doesn't yeah doesn't say
anything it doesn't tell me that he
would so like some people you've got to
feel because I want two people that day
you're like
he hasn't three bad today but
yeah but even that you know yeah you can
tell it's like it's like 200 hats you're
like yeah exactly how how do you deal

[1:40:01]
like yeah exactly how how do you deal
with that like in live poker where
obviously in in the High Roller Fields
it's a bit different because you play
you build up sample against people and
that's probably also something that you
find very enjoying right that you can
actually play against the same players

[1:40:15]
actually play against the same players
you can develop strategies uh but how do
you do that with unknowns I think a lot
of people give a lot of emphasis oh I
played three orbits this guy hasn't
played a hand and now he raised must be
Aces right
but how do you deal with the fact that
it's you have less information does that

[1:40:30]
it's you have less information does that
just revert your strategy way more
towards uh GTO I guess
yeah I mean I think that you can still
have some reads like especially if you
play online you might there's a lot of
people to play online and you can have
reads where you have more hands from

[1:40:46]
reads where you have more hands from
them from those games
uh if it's someone you don't play you
can either go by like just
population rates
uh generally most of the people I play
against are the same people and I'm

[1:41:02]
against are the same people and I'm
playing more hands against them if I
play like uh 10K or 25k that's a lot
bigger like the ones in PCA I think the
25k's had 180 people or something so and
then the massive one had a thousand
people

[1:41:17]
you know you just kind of have to
I mean hopefully you would have some
notes if you don't you can
just like making education guess of
Maybe by their Hender mobile results

[1:41:31]
Maybe by their Hender mobile results
like how you think they'll play uh or
you can just play just try and play good
poker against people I think that like
it's much more dangerous
to do like what what you said I have had

[1:41:45]
to do like what what you said I have had
there's been quite a few people that
I've coached to play live
do say that where
this guy had in three bet for an hour
I'm just like aren't you playing 22
hands an hour like
he they might

[1:42:01]
he they might
they might not have v-pipped for an hour
and I don't I don't care
you know online if you so if you play if
you sit down at zoom and you just see
like zero zero zero out 22 hands
you you just instantly say Okay 22 hands

[1:42:17]
you you just instantly say Okay 22 hands
I just don't care about those stats
until it's 2 000 hands or something
right just like you just don't even look
at the HUD stats until they're
over a couple of thousand hands
uh you can look at some maybe like the
button open or under the gun open where

[1:42:32]
button open or under the gun open where
you know it starts to be more reliable
early on
but yeah live four hours playing when
someone doesn't tell you anything and I
think it's way more dangerous to say to
make like big exploits based on four
hours of play

[1:42:46]
hours of play
uh at least on things that you haven't
seen you know saying like the lack of
free bet or lack of opening doesn't mean
much if you actually saw a showdown
and it's like he opened this hand he's

[1:43:00]
and it's like he opened this hand he's
definitely not meant to
or they went with it and he was
definitely just supposed to give it up
yeah then like those you can make
exploits pretty quickly on live because
some people are just way off
um you know you have that all the time I

[1:43:15]
um you know you have that all the time I
think in Vegas it's quite common where
I think a World Series last year I
opened the button and some guy like
folded A6 off face up to me in the big
blind
and he's just like thank you where he's

[1:43:32]
and he's just like thank you where he's
just like oh like Ace rag showing like
oh I didn't fold a good hand and like in
his head this just isn't a good hand
and you know then you could be like oh I
just opened 100 abundance now yeah it's
the play that you use you you that you
would make with a deuce offsuit and you

[1:43:46]
would make with a deuce offsuit and you
do it for the same reason yeah
uh yeah so it's not very smart of the
big plan
so like those things you can make huge
adjustments but yeah I would definitely
avoid doing this kind of I haven't seen
this guy three bet today so I'm gonna

[1:44:01]
this guy three bet today so I'm gonna
assume it's Aces
I wanted to revert a little bit back to
the storyline after uh two went broke
and you spend at the five five to six
years I think it took you between that
period to actually establish yourself at
the high road of scene

[1:44:17]
the high road of scene
um in these five six years
what drove you to to get towards the
High Roller scene and to get it to stake
what was like the why uh behind every
day showing up and you know putting in

[1:44:31]
day showing up and you know putting in
the work and also how has your why
changed throughout your career
uh
I think for most of my career I just
showed up because I enjoy it
like I just want to play and I want to

[1:44:46]
like I just want to play and I want to
get better so there's not it doesn't
really feel like I am choosing to
show up and it's just like that's my
natural I like games I really like this
game
and

[1:45:02]
and
uh you know it's done a lot for me in
terms of providing an income as well
and
I don't really know what you know a lot
of the years there was just no
alternative I didn't want to do anything
else so it wasn't really I didn't even

[1:45:16]
else so it wasn't really I didn't even
have a name or always to it wasn't like
I was just thinking oh I want to be able
to play 50k so I'm gonna aim for that it
was just I want to play poker and I want
to play the higher Stakes that I can
play at my ability so I will get better

[1:45:30]
play at my ability so I will get better
because I'm competitive and want to get
better I'm going to play because I want
to play every day and
if that means that in a year's time I
get to play a 50k because I think that's
my level and I have the bankroll for it
then
so be it but I don't think I actually

[1:45:46]
so be it but I don't think I actually
had that much of a kind of aim of you
know I'm going to sit down and work
until I can get to that level you're
very process Focus you're just like
listen I'm gonna put in the day every
day because I enjoy playing poker
playing pokers what I do and then you
evaluate situations oh apparently I have

[1:46:01]
evaluate situations oh apparently I have
this much money now where I'm at this
skill level so now I can actually play
this game
yeah yeah I think it was probably even
less thought than that it wasn't even it
was just like
you know what am I going to do today
play poker like I just want to like okay

[1:46:16]
play poker like I just want to like okay
I'm curious walk us through a day in the
life of uh 25 year old Ben
week in the Life month in the life I
mean it can be all the same basically if
you just play poker every day by the way
you wake up you yeah 25 I'm just trying

[1:46:31]
you wake up you yeah 25 I'm just trying
to think
you're playing online or live
cash MPT we're still mixing it up mostly
live then still mixing I think
uh
mostly mtts mostly live uh I didn't I I

[1:46:47]
mostly mtts mostly live uh I didn't I I
didn't like the online thing for a long
time because of the schedule in Europe I
really don't I really didn't like the
thing of
only really playing Sundays and
sometimes like Thursdays because

[1:47:00]
sometimes like Thursdays because
those were the bigger days and then it
just but then going till 4am and that's
not the time I wanted to be up until the
other nights
uh so I think that was like the main
driver of me stopping online you know if
I lived in Canada I would probably still

[1:47:16]
I lived in Canada I would probably still
be playing online more
uh because it wouldn't unless with
you know my like now when I go out for
dinner with friends or I go to the gym
in the morning with friends
it's normal time schedules because a lot

[1:47:31]
it's normal time schedules because a lot
of my friends have different jobs
so if I was living in Canada and could
play
10 a.m to 10 p.m it wouldn't mess that
up uh
so yeah I think that was one of the
bigger reasons I stopped online so I

[1:47:46]
bigger reasons I stopped online so I
think in like 2015 I was already mainly
just playing live and was traveling a
lot I think I think I was traveling like
seven to ten months a year depending on
the year because I mean there was just
so many poker stops like if you were

[1:48:00]
so many poker stops like if you were
playing
different if you were happy to play all
Stakes
you could just go and play games all the
time
like now it's a bit harder if I want to
play
uh by her estate stuff

[1:48:16]
uh by her estate stuff
there are just there's just a limit of
how many stops there are that have those
games
um but at the time I could just kind of
Happily travel 10 months a year
and just always be playing so I think it
was more that it was just like sometimes

[1:48:30]
was more that it was just like sometimes
be home hang out with parents and
friends and play Zoom
or online tournaments every day
and then
then travel and I guess the only real
time off would be like sometimes taking
time before or after trips like after

[1:48:45]
time before or after trips like after
the Aussie Millions would take
you know we got to to be in Australia
two or three times I went
um and sometimes like I think before
around Bahamas I used to go to New York

[1:49:00]
around Bahamas I used to go to New York
for a few days see friends and then like
make Miami on the way home
um so like other than those times off it
was just
I was either on a poke trip or a home in
plant poker
yeah I can definitely relate to choosing

[1:49:15]
yeah I can definitely relate to choosing
I guess you could say choosing a little
bit of Life EV right you don't want to
have a weird schedule that kind of
screws up your social life for example I
for a long time I played nine to five
like office jobs yeah and that was just
that was just what I wanted to do and
even if there was a big will or

[1:49:30]
even if there was a big will or
something at five o'clock I was like
well it's five o'clock work days over
did that bye bye see you next day right
yeah yeah you have to figure out what
works for you right did you ever maybe
consider you said if you would live in
Canada or maybe Mexico or something you

[1:49:46]
Canada or maybe Mexico or something you
could do that have you ever considered
uh moving there to play more online
poker maybe especially when the buying
start to increase over the years
uh
not particularly I think I just enjoyed
it less anyway I liked online cash but I

[1:50:02]
it less anyway I liked online cash but I
wasn't a huge fan of online tournaments
I agree with this one actually and I
liked
I liked the traveling and that was like
you know I was traveling like I said

[1:50:16]
you know I was traveling like I said
like seven to ten months a year and that
was enough poker so I didn't
really have that many times where I was
looking for how can I play more I was
just enjoying what I was doing uh and
then
I think since

[1:50:31]
I think since
over the last maybe four or five years
where things have been a lot more but at
the time when I first started poker it
was studying was just talking hands it
just like
talk to Charlie and be like hey you
think this hand was good or bad like

[1:50:45]
think this hand was good or bad like
like you know there was much more
limited study and it's like okay watch
you run it once video and hope the guy
you're watching is
telling you the right stuff they might
not be like they're winning in their
games they still might
tell you the wrong things I mean I watch
I watch stuff these days to keep up with

[1:51:02]
I watch stuff these days to keep up with
everything
and I watched a coaching video the other
day like uh you know YouTube
free coaching thing
and
they were saying some stuff about a spot

[1:51:17]
they were saying some stuff about a spot
that I think was completely wrong but
you know if you're watching the video
how are you how do you know like how
would you
no and I think like I know now but you
can't tell and at the time that was your

[1:51:30]
can't tell and at the time that was your
only option
now
there's the last like four or five years
I've been doing my study mostly with
solvers
and you know you're still doing it with
friends but there's a lot more focus on
solvers and

[1:51:46]
solvers and
for at least certain parts of Poker you
have more reliable outputs
so
since that's happened I've kind of
enjoyed the not being such a full
schedule anyway like I travel five
months a year and then I

[1:52:00]
months a year and then I
study the time off which is like nice as
well so the only thing I've ever had
that point of needing more poker to play
uh that makes a lot of sense I'm curious
in terms of grinding a life schedule uh
how has

[1:52:15]
how has
your I guess professionality evolve then
over those years you mentioned in the
passive voice more you go with the flow
oh uh San Remo okay well poker trip
later on you start to plan more like
your hours and I'm also curious in terms

[1:52:30]
your hours and I'm also curious in terms
of expenses like in the beginning I can
imagine you know you're you're attracted
to flashy things uh later in your career
it remained the same or you became more
conscious about okay I want to achieve a
certain hourly therefore I need to pick
these stops therefore I need to keep my

[1:52:45]
these stops therefore I need to keep my
expenses or this budget is there
anything like that going on or was it
always just go with the flow basically
up until now or did you evolve
um throughout the years and how you plan
those things
like buying tickets earlier for example
yeah I mean I think it's definitely

[1:53:01]
yeah I mean I think it's definitely
changed if anything
it's
maybe gone the the opposite the way you
were suggesting in terms of
when I was first starting I had to buy
tickets really early because I hadn't I
didn't have any money like when I first

[1:53:15]
didn't have any money like when I first
went I think the first time I went to
Bahamas I had like a 3K roll or
something and I got a flight from
LA to London for 120 with Norwegian
and you know like four months in advance
or something and I had to do that

[1:53:31]
or something and I had to do that
because I was going to Bahamas and had a
3K role and I wanted money to play the
game so I couldn't spend like 1K on the
flights
now I am studying so much and the games
have

[1:53:45]
have
like I think my you know my hourly is a
lot higher than it was then the trips
are worth a lot more and I think my
study time and personal time at home I
value a lot higher
and
I will kind of value convenience over

[1:54:02]
I will kind of value convenience over
budgeting so like if I have to spend
more
to be able to book a flight later when I
know which one I want
I will do that
uh same in terms of like long trips if
I'm going in the direction like you know

[1:54:17]
I'm going in the direction like you know
this one coming up I fly from Paris on
the 27th
to Vietnam
arrive on the 28th and play on the first
and I don't need to on the way back
because I on the way back I'm not coming

[1:54:31]
because I on the way back I'm not coming
back to play games but from Paris to
Vietnam I'm flying business because I
think it's worth it to
sleep when I have to play the next day
and it's a 17 hour travel day so I think
if anything it's kind of gone the other
way in terms of I'm almost willing to

[1:54:45]
way in terms of I'm almost willing to
spend more on stuff now just because I
think it's
the value is there to do it
uh in terms of the hourly and choosing
trips
I don't

[1:55:00]
I don't
at the moment there's some of that but I
think they really are limited you know
for the games I want to play there's
only kind of
four or five months of trips a year so I
typically just play them all because
otherwise I mean I don't play them or I

[1:55:16]
otherwise I mean I don't play them or I
don't always go to I think there's a few
like recently before Bahamas there was
Pokemon Go stuff in Vegas
um and I didn't really want to do that
so you know I won't play 100 of
everything but I typically just play
every EBT
every Triton stop and then

[1:55:33]
every Triton stop and then
Vegas in summer
uh so I don't have to kind of work out
my you know hourly or how much the trips
are worth as much because I'm pretty
much just going to play them
uh I have had to do more planning

[1:55:46]
uh I have had to do more planning
over the last few years like I
started seeing someone just before
covert
and we got married
four months ago five months ago uh in

[1:56:00]
four months ago five months ago uh in
September
thank you uh
so now we do a little more planning in
terms of
you know
I'm not going to Vegas for the whole
seven weeks because
that's a long time to be a part and we

[1:56:16]
that's a long time to be a part and we
don't want to do that so now there's
some like personal life planning
um
but
yeah other than that
uh
yeah I mean I think it's changed over

[1:56:32]
yeah I mean I think it's changed over
the years but it's still roughly similar
in terms of I go and play what I want to
play and that happens to be fewer things
these days
but it is still the same in terms of
when there are games in Vegas if I don't

[1:56:45]
when there are games in Vegas if I don't
feel like going to Vegas and being jet
lagged I just don't go
and if that means giving up EV fine
yeah but so you you got yourself in a
situation where you can just give up EV
right and I think actually this was I

[1:57:00]
right and I think actually this was I
was listening to another conversation
you had with someone else and I think
you mentioned uh it was something about
in this period right 25 year old Ben
you're just grinding your ass off also
for like future event future sort of
Freedom right what you had to do with

[1:57:15]
Freedom right what you had to do with
your time back then uh well not much
right so let's just focus on poker so
right now for example in the future
maybe if you have family life you would
like to spend more time and you got
yourself in a position where you can
choose to play poker if you want to but

[1:57:30]
choose to play poker if you want to but
you don't have to which of them
recommend people in their 20s basically
grind their ass off to have this future
Freedom do you think that has gains a
lot of Life EV
I think

[1:57:46]
yeah I mean it's hard I know there's
been some discussion about this recently
with
uh I think a few people have gone back
and forth about how much you should
enjoy your 20s versus work I mean it's

[1:58:00]
enjoy your 20s versus work I mean it's
quite funny at the time because I
remember
thinking and saying at the time that oh
one day hopefully I will get married and
I may want more time and freedom then to
be with her and I don't and now I'm
single and I want to play poker so

[1:58:15]
single and I want to play poker so
I just want to like earn money to give
me that freedom then and it's like has
actually worked out that way and now I
have the option to do that uh
at the time
I

[1:58:32]
uh
I was like going through some like
tough personal stuff when I was in my
first years of Poker
and poker also I think offered me like a

[1:58:47]
and poker also I think offered me like a
nice distraction from that in terms of
sometimes when I was just
by myself with my thoughts I wasn't very
happy at the time
and poker was quite a like I was I was
happy when I played poker it was like

[1:59:00]
happy when I played poker it was like
very you know if you're four tabling
Zoom I would just be thinking about that
and while I would not
like in hindsight I would have told
myself hey like get therapy like it
doesn't just go away by playing poker
over it but at the time

[1:59:15]
over it but at the time
I didn't really know these things didn't
know how to deal with it and that was
like a way that I dealt with it at the
time whether that was good or bad
um
so at the time it just made sense to me
I was like look you know I'm not that
happy right now and when I'm just doing

[1:59:31]
happy right now and when I'm just doing
other stuff that's not poker I'm not
even enjoying it that much because I'm
kind of sad
so if I can
make a bunch of money for some like time
in the future I won't be sad
that seems like a good option again like
no no endorsing that yeah I know it

[1:59:47]
no no endorsing that yeah I know it
should have got therapy instead but it
was very convenient for your situation I
I guess the thing is if
if putting yourself always in poker and
if that means grinding six seven days a
week if that actually makes you very
unhappy while doing it obviously maybe

[2:00:02]
unhappy while doing it obviously maybe
you should reconsider how much time
you're spending and maybe you should
balance it out a little bit more but
overall I would say I agree I actually
always had a different mindset
reflecting on it I think there were
definitely some some flaws in there I

[2:00:15]
definitely some some flaws in there I
saw a lot of people around me having the
same mindset right like oh I'm gonna
work my ass off now to play 16 hours a
16 hour days grind six days a week
because you know I can My Views higher
now I need to make all my money now and
I always looked at that maybe a little
bit I'm like

[2:00:31]
bit I'm like
I guess it was a bit I don't know I I
never really understood it because I
always said like yeah it's not like if
poker's over you're not gonna do
anything uh that was always kind of My
Philosophy but now in hindsight I
understand more ah it's the yes you can
still do things but you do it because

[2:00:45]
still do things but you do it because
you want to not because you have to and
that was kind of the part that I missed
I think in hindsight also looking back I
had a little bit uh bad associations
around making money which kind of
prevented me from focusing more on
making money now that my EV was at its

[2:01:00]
making money now that my EV was at its
highest for example when I was basically
at the peak of the peak of my career
highest earning potential I decided to
focus on coaching instead which you know
from a very EV driven perspective in the
way people would would look at poker
normally that was not a great decision I

[2:01:15]
normally that was not a great decision I
had my reasons for that hindsight
looking again I think there were
definitely some flaws in it but so I I
would say as long as it doesn't make you
completely unhappy no no wait as long as
it doesn't make you unhappy you
shouldn't uh you should definitely go
for it right when you have the chance so

[2:01:31]
for it right when you have the chance so
that later in life you don't have to at
least make the decisions because you
have to financially do something right I
think I think that's in general I would
say good advice
yeah I mean I think there's some balance
there in terms of you know it's

[2:01:45]
there in terms of you know it's
there's no
it's you know if you're 35 or 40 or
whatever age when maybe you would like
to slow down a bit it's like it it
doesn't matter if you're still working
you still like poker that's fine and you

[2:02:01]
you still like poker that's fine and you
don't need to
give up 100 of your 20s never have any
fun or do anything else because you want
to not work at all when you're 40. uh
like I think there should be some
balance and you enjoyed yourself right

[2:02:16]
balance and you enjoyed yourself right
while traveling you enjoy traveling so
it was a it was yeah yeah that's what
made it together like uh yeah I mean at
the time I loved it and I didn't want to
do
anything else most days
uh and I think like some of the things

[2:02:30]
uh and I think like some of the things
maybe I would have liked to do but were
hard to do in terms of
like
maybe I would have liked to do
you know five days after a trip
uh doing certain things or going to like

[2:02:48]
uh doing certain things or going to like
music festivals and summer and I still
did some of those things but some of
them were hard just because I had kind
of I wasn't in a group of people that
were doing that and I just chose
like oh if I want to do those things

[2:03:00]
like oh if I want to do those things
regularly
it might mean being
like changing my routine like you can't
just suddenly you can't go from being
like 99
work and then the one percent suddenly
do really fun things because you haven't

[2:03:15]
do really fun things because you haven't
planned them in the time you know you're
you were mostly working
so sometimes the kind of time off was a
little
less fun maybe because
I was in that work mode and was

[2:03:30]
I was in that work mode and was
friends of people who were also doing
that uh
we still did
you know
a bunch of
stuff when we could uh
and I mean there was a lot of variety in

[2:03:45]
and I mean there was a lot of variety in
your lifestyle traveling various
locations meeting various people yeah
it's not like if you play online on you
know in your basement and you lock
yourself up for six for six years have
no interaction with people that's that's
obviously a little bit different I would
say no I found it a lot hard like when

[2:04:01]
say no I found it a lot hard like when
we lived in London even just playing
four days online in a row I would find
tougher and like want to go out and do
stuff in London but yeah I mean
traveling to casinos and playing
you kind of feel like you're like on
holiday all the time you're yeah you're

[2:04:16]
holiday all the time you're yeah you're
meeting new people I think it was good
for me confidence-wise I was quite shy
in like school and University and it was
quite good just like meeting a lot of
new people
uh and so yeah I mean I for me I didn't
really feel that much like I was missing

[2:04:30]
really feel that much like I was missing
anything and still don't actually I
don't really feel like I missed out on
anything that's I would just go back and
do it the same
um and
even now like
yeah I'm in a position now where I can
skip trips but I work on poker pretty

[2:04:48]
skip trips but I work on poker pretty
much every day of the year
and so it's not like I've like got to
this point and now I can like finally
take time off poker like I still just
don't want to
so you know maybe in the future if I

[2:05:00]
so you know maybe in the future if I
decide not to play poker at one point I
will really appreciate not
having to do anything
for money and can do
something like a job that's not paid if
I want to
but you know I'm still not at the point

[2:05:15]
but you know I'm still not at the point
where I'm like oh I gave up my 20s but
at least now I don't have to play poker
like at the moment I'm still yeah
exactly but that is the thing right you
you have you have choice
yeah yeah and you were you worked
yourself you worked hard to get yourself
in a position where you can choose I

[2:05:31]
in a position where you can choose I
think that's that's very valuable advice
and then people should reflect on what
working hard means for them yeah and you
know if if they value uh if you value if
they value this equally you and being
able to choose like I think a lot of

[2:05:45]
able to choose like I think a lot of
people kind of maybe frame it as being
able to choose to not play poker and
maybe that is the way you know there are
some people who come into poker that I
speak to who are already looking for a
way out they're like oh I want to use
poker to earn money to do this

[2:06:00]
poker to earn money to do this
but even if you want to be a poker
player
uh
I'm lucky now in terms of
being able to
take six months a year to study at home
is also like a massive privilege because

[2:06:15]
is also like a massive privilege because
a lot of people are like no I can't do
that I need to play I need to come back
from the church and play online to pay
life expenses
so you know it doesn't have to be like
oh I've given myself the opportunity to
do this thing outside of Poker I've also
given myself the opportunity to spend

[2:06:31]
given myself the opportunity to spend
more time studying which I like
just as much as playing and you know now
get to do that and not be like oh
I'm not earning money this month because
I'm not traveling
I've heard you mentioned throughout the

[2:06:46]
I've heard you mentioned throughout the
conversation studying a lot you also
talked about how studying has evolved
using solvers you also mentioned you
went on
like a little bit of uh
three month stretch where you studied
for six seven days basically I guess I'm

[2:07:01]
for six seven days basically I guess I'm
gonna ask you the question what do you
do if you study the game for three
months six seven days a week are you
just kind of rebuilding your game from
stretch how does that look
uh I mean at the time I was kind of

[2:07:15]
uh I mean at the time I was kind of
yeah I guess rebuilding from scratch in
terms of I hadn't done a ton of silver
work and was learning this new way to
think about
situations and really learning how the
solvers work
um

[2:07:31]
um
and
you know
it's compared to playing I find the
studying
very tough like it's very tiring and I
can't do
I can't study eight hours a day whereas
I can play eight hours a day

[2:07:47]
um so you know when I say six to seven
days a week I don't mean six seven days
a week ten hours a day like playing like
when I was playing online I might just I
just mean like four hours a day and then
I was cycling a lot swimming a lot and
climbing and you know

[2:08:02]
climbing and you know
sitting like my parents and
uh watching Final tables and stuff
um but like the actual hard studying was
you know a few hours a day
um but yeah it was

[2:08:16]
um but yeah it was
at that point those three months it was
kind of like rebuilding some things from
scratch in terms of how you think how I
thought about poker uh
because you know I'd never learned it
from the solver like we didn't have

[2:08:30]
from the solver like we didn't have
solvers when I first started and you
know suddenly we did and
there are certain things where the
computer thinks very differently to
humans about poker and learning that was
you know it takes quite a lot of time

[2:08:45]
you know it takes quite a lot of time
because you have to
recalibrate and realize where you're
like oh this makes a ton of sense to me
this is how poker works this is how I'm
going to play this situation and then
the computer's like no that's not how
poker works and that's not how you
should play the situation
and you have to realize that the thing

[2:09:02]
and you have to realize that the thing
you thought you understood was just like
a narrative you told yourself about how
you or someone else had told you the
game worked
and they were guessing
and you know some of that just got
completely eradicated and you have to be

[2:09:16]
completely eradicated and you have to be
like oh actually
uh you know there's a lot more to learn
here so
uh yeah it was just kind of a lot of
time
what was the the the
like the biggest aha moment you had in

[2:09:32]
like the biggest aha moment you had in
those in those perish period
uh
it's a good question actually I'm not
I'm not actually off the top of my head

[2:09:45]
I'm not actually off the top of my head
I can't really think of a single one I
mean it's just so much like the whole
just
conceptually how different
poker is when you look at it from that
way to how people did 10 years ago
I mean not everyone you know when you

[2:10:00]
I mean not everyone you know when you
look back there were some people
who kind of knew what was going on but
99.9 of the field I think
thoughts about Poco Ray definitely to
the computer so I'd only I didn't really
have one thing where I'm like oh this is
crazy it was more like all of this is

[2:10:15]
crazy
all of it looks crazy but for example
before that
so now I'm actually curious because you
know there was always some debate I
remember when I was doing twitching I
had a clip of Charlie saying [ __ ] GTO
GTO it's not the way to go and then I

[2:10:30]
GTO it's not the way to go and then I
also saw actually YouTube videos of GTO
guys reviewing Charlie's play and
thought process and actually he was very
GTO he wasn't saying that he was playing
GTO but his
a lot of his thought process in terms of
thinking what you're trying to achieve
this is something a solver is trying to

[2:10:45]
this is something a solver is trying to
achieve something right with certain
strategy that they use and Charlie was
also trying to achieve certain things
two questions then actually I don't
think I asked you what was like the main
aha moment that you got from uh when you
started with Charlie
and how close to to GTO how much

[2:11:02]
and how close to to GTO how much
similarities did did the way Charlie
approached poker and the solvers
approach poker how much similarities uh
did you find
this is I think I think a question that
our audience will will like to hear

[2:11:16]
our audience will will like to hear
I think the main thing
with him that I realized that like I was
not intuitively doing was just like the
aggression levels
I think a lot of the top guys are just
at some point in their career pushed it
with aggression

[2:11:31]
with aggression
to wanting to win every pop and a lot of
them probably went too far at points
against certain people
but I think that's
how you learn where the lines are is
like most of the top guys have at some
point pushed it too far and naturally I

[2:11:47]
point pushed it too far and naturally I
was a lot tighter
um
so I think that that was like
something that I
felt a big difference with Charlie
uh he was a bit more optimistic in terms

[2:12:00]
uh he was a bit more optimistic in terms
of good things happening yeah uh
in terms of like
yeah I mean
the like GTO version not GTO stuff

[2:12:16]
the like GTO version not GTO stuff
I think I mean it's very hard to
to say I think a lot of people who are
you know you get people who are very
naturally good at poker and like you
said they might be saying oh like I

[2:12:30]
said they might be saying oh like I
don't play GTO but they maybe are in
terms of yeah they're not they're not
like they haven't studied that but maybe
they're closer to that than they think
and it might just be from a thing of you
know solvers
are like playing against each other and

[2:12:46]
are like playing against each other and
iterating down to a solution where
neither of them can improve
and maybe someone who's just like oh I
don't play GTO is kind of doing the
full exploit line and just knowing quite

[2:13:01]
full exploit line and just knowing quite
well about the like having very good
assumptions about the other players
level so the solver will be like I need
to defend
from this strategy that might happen
and maybe like someone who is doing the

[2:13:15]
and maybe like someone who is doing the
like [ __ ] GTO approach might be like
intuitively I would know that against
someone I think is a top player but
against this guy I don't need to worry
about that so I'm just not going to do
that
so and then you know some people frame

[2:13:31]
so and then you know some people frame
that as like not playing GTO
but
your
you're not playing against the computer
so like you don't need to so in a sense
you are you're just node locking kind of
thing yeah yeah uh

[2:13:48]
thing yeah yeah uh
but you can only you can only node lock
efficiency if you understand poker and
that's what you kind of said about the
intuitive yeah
yeah
uh
so

[2:14:00]
so
I don't know I think that like
I don't know in some ways I think that
like both parts of that argument are
usually closer than they come across
yeah exactly they kind of hate on each
other but if they would just talk about
the similarities that they have hug each

[2:14:16]
the similarities that they have hug each
other you know spread Spread spread more
love between the worlds they would
actually see that they have a lot of
things in common
I mean you kind of naturally hear from
the more polarizing sides anyway right
because a lot of the people you hear
from have YouTube channels or coaching
things and it's a very good point things

[2:14:32]
things and it's a very good point things
these days like
clicks get money and they're like
the polarizing thing like towards being
polarizing exactly if you just talk to
someone who like doesn't have a coaching

[2:14:45]
someone who like doesn't have a coaching
site or doesn't have a YouTube channel
you probably hear a much more middle
response because you know you you hear
that word you hear us people say like oh
like the top tournament guys play this
way and it's like no we don't

[2:15:00]
way and it's like no we don't
and like you know and you hear it from
people who don't play our games it's
like you don't know how we
we play and maybe we disagree with that
but people just say yeah there's a lot
of assumptions on that area for you to
say whatever you're usually the same in

[2:15:15]
say whatever you're usually the same in
high six cash like oh or like you know
the fact that everyone is GTO and
there's no more room but you know if you
look at uh I say sketch games as well
nobody plays perfect they not everyone
agrees on strategical approaches there's

[2:15:30]
agrees on strategical approaches there's
obviously there's also many strategical
approaches you can still take that would
still be you know good strategies and
you know a lot of people still don't
agree and that's why poker you know
still they're still so much room uh yeah
I mean that happens a lot with the high

[2:15:45]
I mean that happens a lot with the high
State scash guys right where you hear
people who are like low to mid Stakes
say oh like this guy is just like GTO
robot and then when you watch some of
those really top guys play you're like
they are
they're almost like they they can play

[2:16:01]
they're almost like they they can play
that way but they are off in like almost
every spot because they're
trying to be and I think it's like they
get claimed as like the GTO robots by
people who don't know enough about
Theory to spot whether they're actually

[2:16:16]
Theory to spot whether they're actually
they're just like oh he took some sick
line it's probably GTO I don't
understand it's like no it's not
it's just so I I think that happens a
lot but but yeah I mean it's you know
the most vocal people at the moment

[2:16:30]
the most vocal people at the moment
generally I think just have incentives
for forgetting reactions so you just
naturally always hear about that and the
people that are going to give you the
really like well thought out moderated
responses or like more moderate

[2:16:45]
responses or like more moderate
and not the ones that are online saying
it and don't have an incentive to be
online saying it so
that's a very good point I think the the
non I think a big difference what the
non-gto guys try to say is that they

[2:17:01]
non-gto guys try to say is that they
don't put a lot of emphasis on a lot of
things that are important to the solver
because the solver knows both strategies
uh so they don't see the the necessity
to defend a certain part of their range
or defend or play the range in a certain

[2:17:15]
or defend or play the range in a certain
way because else something can happen in
the future uh that I would completely
agree with it's often there's a lot of
things in the solver that are just not
very important in real life but in terms
of then how they play certain like I
would say hand placement and bed sizing

[2:17:30]
would say hand placement and bed sizing
in terms of what they're trying to
achieve by putting a hint in a certain
sizing or a hand in a certain line
that's where intuitive players are very
similar to solvers because they just
very much understand what pushing a hand
into a certain direction early on in the
street with a certain sizing or a

[2:17:46]
street with a certain sizing or a
checking or betting what that hence
trying to achieve and I think that's
something that both solver players both
solvers and intuitive players they know
very well personally actually before I
started coaching I was using very and I

[2:18:01]
started coaching I was using very and I
saw this with players around me as well
we were using very little solvers
actually I was starting to use solvers
mainly actually when I was doing
coaching because I thought it was a good
tool to explain
what how I thought that things would
work obviously throughout the process

[2:18:15]
work obviously throughout the process
while explaining things to to other
players and using solvers I saw a lot of
things like okay apparently here I was
wrong right so the software did me a lot
of things but a lot of the concepts like
I said especially a hand Choice
placement bed sizing in terms of what
you're trying to accomplish a lot of the

[2:18:30]
you're trying to accomplish a lot of the
things were actually very similar uh
you mentioned obviously you know
throughout the studying and with solvers
you improved a lot you already mentioned
uh you or this that's how I understood
it you thought you were not as good as
for example Stevie mikida a demo I think

[2:18:46]
for example Stevie mikida a demo I think
you you mentioned these three names
what makes them
so
in your eyes may be superior to the
field
uh

[2:19:00]
uh
not them specifically but what do like
the better players or the players who
you see as the top dogs in the high road
is what do you think do they do better
or what makes someone
stand out

[2:19:16]
I mean I think I think it's pretty hard
to say in terms of I think some of this
stuff people just have different natural
talent and ability levels so
you will you know it's very unlikely
that people have the exact same level

[2:19:30]
that people have the exact same level
and once you get to a certain stake
where everyone's putting in really hard
work
you might just revert to having the
Talent come back out like I think at Mid
Stakes you can kind of outwork a lot of
people who are maybe more talented than

[2:19:45]
people who are maybe more talented than
you because if someone's putting in
eight hours a week of study and thinks
that's enough and they're better than
you naturally but you want to put in 25
hours a week studying and you most like
unless you're you know what much worse
than them you're gonna outperform them

[2:20:00]
than them you're gonna outperform them
once you get to the higher Stakes where
everyone's pretty good naturally and
you're all putting in
60 hours a week of play and study and
there's not really much more hours you
can put in
you know there's some like efficiency
stuff with how you study your resources

[2:20:16]
stuff with how you study your resources
and like how you spend your time
um
but
you know if everyone's doing pretty
similar levels of that it might just
come down again to

[2:20:31]
come down again to
who is naturally better
uh some of it I also think is time spent
in the game like you know you see
some of the online cash guys that did
really well
six seven years ago and came up really

[2:20:46]
six seven years ago and came up really
fast you know it turned out in the end
that some of them were just the first
people to access solvers
and I think that that has also been one
of the things that has created a bit
less turnover like when I first started

[2:21:00]
less turnover like when I first started
playing you saw a lot more kind of 20 21
year olds coming up
and crushing and these days I think the
Ohio State's pool is generally older
and you don't see quite as many new
people because I think it's just hard
a lot you know

[2:21:15]
a lot you know
there is changing
there's still stuff changing with
certain things but
you know
Pirates over has had pretty good outputs
for
just
like heads up

[2:21:30]
like heads up
poker for a while
and
how easy is it for you to catch up as a
21 year old with a 30 year old who's
been studying the solvers for seven
years
you know there's just like too much
experience there so some of it I think
is that in terms of

[2:21:46]
is that in terms of
you know
Maybe
I I think I've been using the service
for like five years now maybe sometimes
I play against someone who's been using
them for eight and sometimes the
difference might just be that it's like
an extra extra three years uh of

[2:22:04]
an extra extra three years uh of
you know we're both trying to play the
same way and they've got three years
more behind them of doing that some I
think is just like natural ability like
you see something like this you know
like
uh

[2:22:16]
uh
I think
there's just yeah some people that still
play multiple games like short deck cash
and mtts and they're just very very good
intuitively uh
poker and getting these Concepts right

[2:22:31]
poker and getting these Concepts right
and
it's hard to like pinpoint exactly what
makes them crush the games but yeah
again I guess it's the same as I was
saying before maybe it's just like a
natural Liberty there just
uh you know takes less

[2:22:47]
uh you know takes less
effort for them to understand things and
nail the concepts and so like if you
both put the same work in they will just
be slightly better
um but yeah I mean it's hard to say
because I've had points in my career

[2:23:01]
because I've had points in my career
where I've thought that you know like
uh
you know I I remember thinking before
like oh the top
50 in the world
are all talented at poker they all work

[2:23:18]
are all talented at poker they all work
a lot and I work a lot and I think I'm
less talented and I'm maybe a hundredth
and I don't think I can ever get into
the top 50 because like where like where
does that come from if they're already

[2:23:31]
does that come from if they're already
working as hard as me and they're and I
think they're naturally better than me
how would I get into the top 50 and
now uh
I would think that I am in the top 50.
and was if that's true was wrong at that

[2:23:48]
and was if that's true was wrong at that
point so it's also hard for me to say in
terms of
you know maybe some of that stuff will
change and people overtake each other
and
[Music]
it's quite hard to see I guess without

[2:24:02]
it's quite hard to see I guess without
because a lot of the people you play
against you don't
you don't have full information you
don't know what resources they have
uh you don't know
how much they study you don't know how
much they play you don't know actually

[2:24:15]
much they play you don't know actually
what their results are so there's a lot
of
like
it's quite hard to actually
see everything that's going on and
see what you know make someone better or

[2:24:30]
see what you know make someone better or
worse out and if they are better or
yeah
you think are like you know there might
be someone in your pool that you're like
oh he's better than me and I'm better
than that guy and maybe it's the other
way around like yeah
maybe the other guy's better than you

[2:24:46]
maybe the other guy's better than you
and you're better than the other guy
like you don't really it's it's so
biased also based on like short-term
experience I've had multiple like study
sessions with virus players and then you
see your hands against player I'm like
wow that guy is like the worst the worst
player in the pool whenever someone else
is like oh he always puts me in a tough

[2:25:01]
is like oh he always puts me in a tough
spot just because of a short-term run of
sample you know he managed to get every
time get into spots and obviously
especially if you fault you don't see
his cards so on a short-term sample
everyone can have or even on a big even
in a long-term but actually if I look at

[2:25:16]
in a long-term but actually if I look at
online cash and if you would ask 10
players to make a top ten there would be
different players uh maybe they will
agree on like you know certain guys
always being in that list but then it
varies and that's just based on
short-term experience with the player a

[2:25:30]
short-term experience with the player a
player that just can also be that his
playing style kind of naturally placed
good against your playing style that
probably also has something to do
there's like a natural match up there uh
when you talk about yeah I was going to
say as well like the thing that you said
that you were going through with the

[2:25:46]
that you were going through with the
kind of fancy play Syndrome I think it's
really easy for a lot of people to mix
up playing tough with playing well like
there are people that can put you in a
lot of spots where it's like oh this guy
check raises the river against me a lot
and it makes me
and like it's a tough spot and it might

[2:26:02]
and like it's a tough spot and it might
just be like he's
torching money by not having a high
enough bet frequency on the river which
means he doesn't get to Bluff just
because he wants to find the fancy check
raises so I think you get a lot of that
as well where someone's like this guy's
tough to play against and it's like yeah

[2:26:15]
tough to play against and it's like yeah
he's not winning though he's just like
annoying to play against because he
keeps trying to find these weird lines
that you've never been in but yeah it's
not doing it well you're just
yeah that's a very good point because
you see that also because sometimes uh
players are very tough to play against

[2:26:30]
players are very tough to play against
and they they look very tough but then
in the end in the end they're not
winning and you see a guy who's who will
never basically put you in a tough spot
to place quite straightforward and he's
in the end the biggest winner you also
obviously have the flip side a guy who's
very straightforward and is also the
biggest loser and a guy who's very

[2:26:46]
biggest loser and a guy who's very
creative and aggressive and who's also
the biggest winner so obviously within
this there's there's there's there's
good and bad but I do think it's uh it's
indeed a very interesting point thing to
point out that it can also be let's say
you're naturally a bit more risk-averse
a bit more passive and a bit more foldy

[2:27:01]
a bit more passive and a bit more foldy
and you play against a guy who's over
regressive like these two playing Styles
will naturally mean that you will get
run over uh uh by that player I was
curious what you meant with you said
obviously there's a lot of talented
players
what what what do you mean with that

[2:27:16]
what what what do you mean with that
what kind of Talent OR predisposition do
you think the top have
uh

[2:27:30]
I think maybe just
yeah I mean it's really hard to pinpoint
or describe what it would be just like a
natural intuition for how games work and
like where the equilibriums land

[2:27:47]
like where the equilibriums land
um and then maybe of how
easy it is to be off of that as well
like you get some people that are very
in tune with
you know how many value combos there are

[2:28:02]
you know how many value combos there are
how many Bluff combos there are and how
easy it is to be over or under one of
those and can like really quickly switch
from like make strategies to Pure
and
there are some people who are like less

[2:28:15]
there are some people who are like less
intuitive with that and have to study
the spot to get it and you know over a
career that can make a big difference if
say that spot comes up a similar spot
comes up like
like six times a year just so and one

[2:28:32]
like six times a year just so and one
person will
get it right five times after studying
the first one and one person will just
get it right all six because intuitively
they're just like they nail it the first
time you know that is a big difference
in your yearly
so I think there's some people like that

[2:28:46]
so I think there's some people like that
where they're just
intuitively very good at these
these things and then
think different games as well you know
you see a lot of people that are quite
high level of either strategy games as
well and I would I think there's like

[2:29:02]
well and I would I think there's like
some crossover in how your thought
process should uh you know can improve
if you're
if you've got very good at another game
um
yeah I'm not sure exactly whether

[2:29:16]
yeah I'm not sure exactly whether
there's like
specific qualities
other than that
um
and I and I do think actually that these
days while there are
certain things I think that like work

[2:29:30]
certain things I think that like work
ethic has a big
part of it and a bigger part than I
first thought I used to think that like
Talent was a lot more involved and I
think it is still but in actually
separating people at certain levels
um

[2:29:46]
um
I think work ethic has a huge impact and
I think actually that's one of the main
things like when you asked me from
University what helped me in my math
course I think the main thing that
helped me was just the work ethic that I
had to do 55 hours a week of hard

[2:30:00]
had to do 55 hours a week of hard
thinking work and
was out of now like willing to
do hours studying where maybe I don't
understand a spot and rather than just
being like Oh I think I know what's
going on I'll be like no I'm gonna

[2:30:16]
going on I'll be like no I'm gonna
put the hard work in until I do
understand what's going on whereas maybe
before University I would just be like
oh that's a lot of that's a lot of
thinking
I'll just kind of like half understand
the spot and now let's go and check this

[2:30:30]
the spot and now let's go and check this
other hand I played
[Music]
I think that that actually has like a
yeah just has a very big impact on on
results at every level I think whichever
Stakes you play

[2:30:45]
Stakes you play
the
you know it's the thing you have most
control over too just finding out how to
do
how to make yourself do the tough work
because they're you know it's it's easy
to work right you can you can be like oh
I had

[2:31:01]
I had
20 hands I don't think I played well I'm
gonna run 20 Sims which might take you
an hour to set them up if you're doing
it yourself
and then I'm gonna let them run for two
hours so you feel like semi-productive
because you're
waiting for those things to run and then

[2:31:17]
waiting for those things to run and then
you check them and you're like oh okay
these ones are bad those were mistakes
but you know maybe that's five hours
work but like did you
did you learn much like maybe not
uh so I think learning or getting

[2:31:31]
uh so I think learning or getting
yourself in habits to make yourself do
good work
is
probably the thing that most people I
think are high stakes have in common
rather than there being some random I

[2:31:45]
rather than there being some random I
mean there might be other things and
they're much harder to pinpoint because
I can't just you know I it's not like
I've
done like questionnaires of every high
stakes player I mean like oh they all
have this thing in common but I think
one thing one thing they do have in
common I think is

[2:32:00]
common I think is
is that like
not just how many hours do you study but
like is your study good study because
I've definitely worked with people and
Coach people where I'm like okay you
know tell me how you would study on your

[2:32:15]
know tell me how you would study on your
own for three hours and you look at it
and you're like you're getting like 20
minutes of of useful stuff out of this
three hours and that's not
you know then it doesn't really matter
if you're studying 20 hours a week
you're not going to compete with people
who are doing 15 hours of good study

[2:32:31]
who are doing 15 hours of good study
okay so if I understood correctly Talent
obviously helps but the last talented
are not drawing that because with good
work ethic we can compensate
uh you also mentioned efficiency a
couple times

[2:32:45]
couple times
and you now mentioned someone can study
for three hours but only 20 minutes was
effectively now I'm sure you know a lot
of player a lot of people that are
listening to this podcast in general are
very motivated for poker especially
after this conversation they're extra
motivated you know they might have to
work ethic but they miss the as you said

[2:33:02]
work ethic but they miss the as you said
good work they are not efficient
how what is a tip you would have for our
audience to study the game more
effectively or more efficiently right
they have this motivation where should

[2:33:15]
they have this motivation where should
they put their time in and how should
they approach it
I I think I would guess that for a lot
of people it's kind of In Plain Sight
where it's easy to
when you have a job like poker to be

[2:33:32]
when you have a job like poker to be
like I have a job I like which means I
don't have to do stuff I don't like
and like you might not say it explicitly
like that but in your head you're like
oh I lucked out I have a job that I like
which means I do stuff I like every day

[2:33:45]
which means I do stuff I like every day
when it then comes to a thing where
you're like here's a concept that I
don't understand that lost me a lot of
money so I have like this negative
emotional reaction to reviewing the hand
because I don't want to acknowledge or
think about this like bad mistake I made

[2:34:00]
think about this like bad mistake I made
and then on top of that once you've
decided to acknowledge it you then have
to do the hard work of hard study where
your brain is going to be confused and
you might look at a SIM for an hour and
still not get it and have to run more

[2:34:15]
still not get it and have to run more
and
I think you know having a job or a hobby
that you like doesn't mean you like
every aspect of it
and if you want to play at a high level
there will be parts that you don't want

[2:34:31]
there will be parts that you don't want
to do and it's almost just like being
willing to do them like I think a lot of
people like when I was saying the
example of someone doing three hours
work and only 20 minutes being good I
don't think it's it's not like
necessarily needing to do something
different like they might have the Sims

[2:34:45]
different like they might have the Sims
there but maybe they're just like
only doing the easy bits they're just
like oh like check how
my hand should have played like oh it
was bet no check okay got it wrong
whereas like
you have the Sim you like there's more

[2:35:01]
you have the Sim you like there's more
to learn from it
uh
and
I think a big
thing that makes people not do that is
just like
avoidance of hard work which I think is
like a very natural human thing right

[2:35:15]
like a very natural human thing right
our brains are wired to take the easy
group
uh you know we just like
take the route of least resistance right
I mean I don't know I don't know much
about that psychologically but I'm

[2:35:31]
about that psychologically but I'm
pretty sure I have somewhere in my head
that we are wired that way to just
uh take the easier option when we're
given two options
So Adam
Adam's a performance coach

[2:35:45]
Adam's a performance coach
yes but honestly it's from like an
energy consumption points the brain's
trying to weigh up how much energy will
be consumed by each activity if there's
an easy option that it was less energy
it was a hard option that means more
energy consumption from a survival
mechanism we don't want to expend energy
on things that ours needed importance so

[2:36:02]
on things that ours needed importance so
we're going to choose the default easy
option when given the chance so yeah
it's uh the main main reason then what
overrates the survival mechanism is that
like a strong enough drive to get for
example to the high rotors

[2:36:17]
no just just in general like when people
face like basically their brain or the
way their brain is functioned in order
to save energy in this case it works
against them trying to get to a higher
level what would then override that part

[2:36:31]
level what would then override that part
of the brain is it like okay strong
enough why like I don't settle for for
this or is it like they they've got
comfortable with doing hard stuff I
guess it's a trainable thing right
yeah I'd say there's two main things
first of all importance if it's theme is

[2:36:45]
first of all importance if it's theme is
important for you towards your goals in
meaningful you will generally go towards
it or interest interest like curiosity
if you have some sort of thing that the
brand wants to know answers then you can
those will override that kind of
survival mechanism to go for easy also
like then sort of out trained repetition

[2:37:01]
like then sort of out trained repetition
if doing the hard things almost use that
kind of point where you see yourself
going to deviate towards the easy
options and go ah something could be
happening here where I'm trying to go
for the easy option I'm gonna go for the
hard option because I know there's more
to be gained there so this habitual
nature they've turned on the hard things

[2:37:15]
nature they've turned on the hard things
interest and importance I think would be
the three to get those together most
likely you'll do do the whole things
most most often
actually it reminds me a lot of your
answer Ben reminds me a lot of what you
met Bros that when we were talking about
solvers I think two episodes ago he also

[2:37:31]
solvers I think two episodes ago he also
said when you look at for example I
think he gave a barreling range in
position he said it's very easy to
ignore the low frequency combos right
you see like oh yeah these gutters you
know they're betting 80 of the time oh
yeah this draw yeah I'm doing this and

[2:37:46]
yeah this draw yeah I'm doing this and
then they completely ignore the
the YOLO 54 anti-blocker has nothing uh
hand in there right but it's only in
there like 20 together with the six four
twenty percent but a lot if you just
miss all these combos they add up to a

[2:38:00]
miss all these combos they add up to a
lot in the end right but I think this
was something that uh that that you met
bro set which is I think very similar to
the point that you're making
yeah and I I think that happens a lot
because people
you often review

[2:38:16]
you often review
hands that you think were close
so you can completely miss something
like if you
in a spot like that
maybe you
you know

[2:38:30]
you know
check five four in a spot where it's
just meant to be a low frequency event
but you might not even flag it online
because you're just like oh I'm like
king king queen six I don't Barrel seven
five
so like I pure checked it and I don't

[2:38:46]
so like I pure checked it and I don't
even flag it because it might like
you're just like oh I just like maybe
you're used to barreling equity and you
didn't have equity and you're just like
oh okay that that doesn't need flagging
so you know there are some things where

[2:39:01]
so you know there are some things where
I I think this happens a lot actually
with
uh
you know it's like I'm sure you've had
it too when you coach people
you can ask them for hands

[2:39:16]
you can ask them for hands
like you can say okay send me some hands
and they'll send you hands and it will
be a lot of these big pots like oh this
big three bed Pond the river like what
do you think this guy has and it's like
then if you ask them for a hand history
you'll just see stuff like that where

[2:39:31]
you'll just see stuff like that where
you're like oh I've never seen you
borrow one of these hats that are all
meant to be around like 40 like why have
you never sent me one and they're like
oh I
don't know I just thought that was like
a clear check in my head so you know in

[2:39:48]
a clear check in my head so you know in
that sense as well unless you're doing
the kind of hard work of looking at the
whole spot which can be tiring
you might not you just might miss some
things because you don't even know what
to study you don't even know what you're
looking for whereas like you know if

[2:40:01]
looking for whereas like you know if
you're
if you're like oh I had the nut flush
drawer and top hair like was I meant to
check raise or not like
you know just looking at the Sim and
then just being like Oh yeah check rate
is good like you don't learn much you're

[2:40:15]
is good like you don't learn much you're
just like
yeah okay like a very clear
value combo was so crazy for value and
then you just like close the Sim again
and leave and like you didn't learn
anything you just like confirm that you
played the hand well so what would be

[2:40:30]
played the hand well so what would be
like the correct what would be the next
step
I think just looking at the the whole
spot like
just like okay that was a check raise
are there any of the check crazes that I
wouldn't have found
yeah so don't play Don't maybe you could

[2:40:45]
yeah so don't play Don't maybe you could
use because actually that's that's
interesting because I don't necessarily
mark
that's not maybe it's 50 50 that I Mark
hints that I want to review but often I
Mark spots that I want to review I might
have even just pulled it my particular

[2:41:00]
have even just pulled it my particular
hand but I'm just interested in how this
spot plays or like what kind of sizing
sort of thing or my mind goes like hey I
have this hand is a full but what if I
had a hand that's similar but you know
it looks like it but what if I had a
little bit better a little bit worse
what do I do with those hands and those

[2:41:15]
what do I do with those hands and those
are kind of the hands that I would
attack that I think what you're saying a
lot of people would miss whereas they're
only tagging their specific hand
yeah I mean I think I probably am like
50 50 of tagging specific hands but most
of the spots that I know when I'm

[2:41:32]
of the spots that I know when I'm
playing live is just like
I had a hand there's no close here but I
don't know where the line is like I
don't know what the Fringe combo is yeah
exactly uh so it might just be like Oh
I'm I know I'm like six or seven Pips
too high but am I six or seven

[2:41:46]
too high but am I six or seven
that's interesting like some of the to
get back to a point that we talked about
in terms of intuitive GTO uh as you said
some of the French combos like this is
also like certain hands you need to have
in certain ranges in GTO world because

[2:42:00]
in certain ranges in GTO world because
both players know the way the ranges are
set up in order to have sufficient
Bluffs on later Street bloody blah this
is something that I think where GTO
intuitive Camp might disagree on it's
like what do you mean it's a seven High
that's nothing just check go for bet

[2:42:15]
that's nothing just check go for bet
check bet or something
where you could like in some points
actually you can make the arguments is
it really necessary obviously in certain
things it's just you know it has very
good heuristics of what of why you
should do it but in other points when
it's again driven purely off oh I need
to add this combo because else on you

[2:42:31]
to add this combo because else on you
know these completing cards here in the
top I have insufficient Bluffs which you
know my father would suffer because the
outer position is not calling but then
the intuitive guy that's more grounded
in reality says what does it matter he's
still going to call he's not got a hero
fault he's two pair right so do we

[2:42:46]
fault he's two pair right so do we
really need to add this French Bluff on
the turn in order to have these Bluffs
on the river that's I guess where you
know I thought it was an interesting
point where you could say that the GTO
model would do something simply because
it knows both players strategies right

[2:43:02]
it knows both players strategies right
um yeah I I think that's the common
thing that said although I think that
some of those some of those points are
just like
misunderstood
or maybe like misrepresented by some
people where

[2:43:17]
people where
you know people like okay
maybe it's the hard work thing of like
oh I don't need to Barrel
you know seven five on king king queen
six because you know it's for some like

[2:43:31]
six because you know it's for some like
reason that the solver's doing I don't
completely understand or want to
understand and it's playing against the
solver which I'm not but a lot of those
times when you get the like
you know Ace run out or something
and

[2:43:45]
and
then your hand becomes a good bluff
those ones are often the ones that are
actually under defended by the field
because the population are used playing
as a population that also aren't finding
those Bluffs so sometimes like they're
kind of hard to find silver plays

[2:44:01]
kind of hard to find silver plays
actually make more against people
because of how the like where the
population has settled on
so I think sometimes like the the
argument that the people give against
that stuff is actually
wrong and maybe they're actually arguing

[2:44:16]
wrong and maybe they're actually arguing
without realizing for the Counterpoint
yeah that's a very that that's indeed a
very good point
but it's always good indeed to reflect
on why a certain combo is for example
being slow played that the intuitive

[2:44:30]
being slow played that the intuitive
player wouldn't slow play would just say
well you know I've I have I have to pair
the board looks a bit dry let's let's
let's let's build a pot right uh or
indeed like with with the more French
type of combos uh yeah yeah there's
definitely points where the intuitive

[2:44:45]
definitely points where the intuitive
players are right and you know but and
then you're uh with adding in like some
French combos in spots where your
perceived range is going to improve a
lot based on how the pool construct this
range the intuitive player will get
counter because intuitively he will say
well this is a spot that doesn't get

[2:45:01]
well this is a spot that doesn't get
Bluff because you know all the perceived
plus complete and then here is Ben with
the five seven
yeah I mean I think it's
and I I think that like the
you know sometimes people don't give
both sides enough credit people are just

[2:45:17]
both sides enough credit people are just
too polarized in terms of the intuitive
players are like oh these guys never
deviate where it's like most of the
people studying GTO are aware that
they're not playing a computer
I think also that people people then are
so infested in in their belief that

[2:45:32]
so infested in in their belief that
they only I think this is maybe true for
polarization in general but they throw
even more weight behind it when you
start to question it because and I guess
the more way to then throw behind it the
harder it becomes to admit because then

[2:45:45]
harder it becomes to admit because then
you would have to admit that you are
maybe approaching something soft
optimally not only now but have been in
the last few years so that would make
agreeing or at least opening up to the
idea uh very scary from like I guess an
ego perspective which would only make

[2:46:00]
ego perspective which would only make
them go in protection mode even more and
start to defend their own point and only
throw in more oil on the fire right
which usually happens with this
polarizing points they would just stop
and actually listen to each other and
start to think about points that they
actually agree on then they would
actually have a relevant discussion not

[2:46:16]
actually have a relevant discussion not
good for the algorithm though as you
pointed out which I thought was a very
good comment you mentioned coaching uh
I was I was curious like let's say for
example I joined uh I I open a coach you
go with you you already mentioned like
you would probably look at okay well

[2:46:31]
you would probably look at okay well
here's three hours how would you spend
those three hours most efficiently sort
of like the let's say the three first
lessons you would give to a student that
you think are very important
I would just bet like the first three
sessions

[2:46:45]
sessions
I mean I
I coach like not many people these days
uh you know my own work is just a lot of
my hours
uh and then the people I do coaches just
generally very

[2:47:00]
generally very
person specific so
the
uh you know if it was from live poker
often the first session
I would just ask someone to send me
before the session
hands from every stage of the tournament

[2:47:16]
hands from every stage of the tournament
uh and I would ask them to do it in the
way that we said we do it of like spot
ways so kind of you know I open this
hand but I'm not sure what the opens are
and like this is where I think the line
is
uh and then some final table stuff like

[2:47:32]
uh and then some final table stuff like
approaching the final table
you know three bear pods like everything
with some kind of conceptual thoughts of
how they think spots work
and then
I can actually go from from there I

[2:47:46]
I can actually go from from there I
don't have like a kind of first based
recessions because it's you know people
come with such different ideas about
poker and such different levels
that people just need very different
things so it's usually kind of giving me
as much information as you can about how

[2:48:01]
as much information as you can about how
you currently play and think about poker
and then
I will go through
what I think is highest priority and
highest hourly for you to start on uh
and often it's just like fundamental
stuff like you get a surprising amount

[2:48:16]
stuff like you get a surprising amount
of people who
uh you know just don't actually know
some pre-flop stuff or
drops and it's like you know how how
much do you just like go heads up hijab
first big blind and people are like oh
I've never really like looked at that

[2:48:32]
I've never really like looked at that
much
or
you know I've looked at the seabed
frequency but nothing past that so like
I don't know what happens when I get
check raised enough and like you know
there's a lot of stuff obviously if you
get higher level people it's going to be

[2:48:46]
get higher level people it's going to be
different to that but
uh
you know the first thing is just making
sure all the fundamentals are in place
of like are you playing pre-flop well
and are you playing kind of single
raised heads-up Parts well
um but yeah it would just be

[2:49:03]
send me some sample of every
part of a tournament and
you know from there I can get an idea of
how someone's playing and whether

[2:49:16]
how someone's playing and whether
they're
you know and then you just like pick the
spots where they're really touching you
if they're just like oh you know I
thought it was really close I folded Ace
10 off here and
you know it was like uh 20 continue I'm
like yeah I'm not gonna I'm not gonna

[2:49:30]
like yeah I'm not gonna I'm not gonna
coach yeah yeah I'm not gonna coach you
on like that should have been a 20
continue
but but if people are open folding A6
off suit versus a button open of Ben
Heath
that's probably a point where like okay
buddy we we need to talk

[2:49:45]
buddy we we need to talk
I mean you do see a lot of that stuff if
people are moving from cash to
tournaments you know like you get people
who move from cash to tournaments and
they're like oh I heard aunties make you
wider so I play like one bit wider and
it's like yeah aunties
a little more though no rake no aunties

[2:50:01]
a little more though no rake no aunties
uh significantly widens up the widens up
the ranges uh yeah
common
um
throughout your coaching coaching career
what do you what do you say is the most
common leak you you encounter

[2:50:19]
um
honestly I think it is just like
pre-flop stuff I think it's just
like because of how common all the
pre-flop stuff are there's
yeah

[2:50:32]
yeah
I mean I guess because it's most common
like it's hard there are other things
that come up but different people have
different things but yeah in mtts
it's quite easy just to be like torching

[2:50:45]
it's quite easy just to be like torching
off more money than you think and it's
very hard to come back from like you
know it doesn't matter how good your
turn strategy is if you're missing 0.3
big lines in a single hand pre-flop
because you're playing way too tight or
way too loose like

[2:51:01]
way too loose like
you know you're kind of done unless
you're playing really really soft fields
um but like if you're playing good games
uh sorry like tough games
and you are getting pretty flop spots
massively wrong you just like don't come

[2:51:16]
massively wrong you just like don't come
back from that and
I think a surprising amount of people
probably just haven't put enough time in
especially to some of the like tougher
pre-flop spots
I mean there's a lot you know in
tournaments there's a lot of pre-foughts

[2:51:31]
tournaments there's a lot of pre-foughts
because you know in if you're playing
like Zoom at 100 big blinds you're like
oh okay
I'm gonna it's like a high rate so I'm
gonna play raise only
and you know you don't really need I

[2:51:45]
and you know you don't really need I
mean I haven't played cash in a while
but I think like
you're fine just playing a razor only
Strat in the like Zoom higher rate games
uh
and it's like yeah okay there are some
changes between 100 200 and 300 but
they're pretty easy to learn and most of

[2:52:01]
they're pretty easy to learn and most of
your time is just spent playing 100
beats and if you want you can just
always play 100 base tournaments is that
okay we're gonna start at 250 bags
and
then
in six hours time you might have six
picks like learn the small blind strap

[2:52:17]
picks like learn the small blind strap
for everything in between
and then that's like one position
yeah no it's it's it's so huge I
wouldn't even know what to start I think
I heard was it K rap yeah K rap in a
podcast he talked about he I think he

[2:52:31]
podcast he talked about he I think he
used to always play heads up cash games
and then he suddenly had to study online
uh or tournaments so he noticed very
quickly that his study approach needed
an upgrade and because in cash heads up
you can be very specific like in all

[2:52:46]
you can be very specific like in all
lines you can study really down to down
to like that you were missing a 10
something he would probably have studied
it and has some cash but then if you
start to do that with entities yeah
basically before you went through all
Spots You're Dead that's that that

[2:53:00]
Spots You're Dead that's that that
that's that doesn't really seem like uh
a great strategy yeah

[2:55:02]
in your poker career but for now without
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode
um
Adam
I'm curious
a player that comes to you what are like

[2:55:15]
a player that comes to you what are like
usually the first three lessons that you
have to teach them in order to perform
better and what are like the most common
leaks you see students have who approach
you
yeah I say similar to Ben in terms of I
don't have a this is the first lesson

[2:55:30]
don't have a this is the first lesson
we're going to go through it's generally
solving problems as the players come to
me with them the most common problem
across the mindset spectrum is
attachment to results and players
struggling with varians children with
Down swings children to show up you're

[2:55:45]
Down swings children to show up you're
about spells struggling with emotions
that come up with self-doubt frustration
and being able to show up consistently
during bad spells I think that's the
most common one second most common one
is probably around
um kind of productivity and how to get

[2:56:00]
um kind of productivity and how to get
the most of themselves consistently I
have a group of players I coach each
week and the recurring theme that comes
up most weeks is around the things they
weren't consistent of with but that's
consistent with grinding consistent with
study habits consistent with their
meditation or other habits around the
grains but finding ways to consistently

[2:56:16]
grains but finding ways to consistently
show up so those are the main problems
that players can come in with but yeah a
mixed bag in terms of how I approach
those and also yeah I try to make my
coaching very one-on-one it's always
listening exercise the first part of the
coaches listen to the problems trying to
figure out where they're going wrong and

[2:56:31]
figure out where they're going wrong and
then try to come with Solutions on a
case-by-case basis so yeah based on well
I'll take away from this is your mindset
Ben I know obviously mindful of you at
the time here but um for yourself I know
I you've obviously built a very strong
mindset for poker so I'm curious to know

[2:56:45]
mindset for poker so I'm curious to know
how you've been able to do that I know
you reached out to Elliot raw I met the
game coaching so I'm curious to know
when that was and what made you reach
out Elliot to start building or working
on your mindset
uh
yeah I

[2:57:01]
yeah I
go to when would I have been I mean it
was I would guess five or six years ago
uh and uh
the time it was actually the

[2:57:15]
the time it was actually the
like for a personal life stuff I was not
that happy at the time and one or two of
my close friends were recommending
therapy
and I hadn't really wanted to do it and
who's like looked into it at one point
but then
uh

[2:57:30]
uh spoke to two people in London and
they were like oh we only do it in
person
and I was traveling all the time so that
wasn't a good option and kind of used
that as an excuse to not do it and then
thought someone recommended earlier and

[2:57:46]
thought someone recommended earlier and
I thought oh this should be a good like
in between
[Music]
in terms of its not therapy but like
it's helpful with poker
and he actually
uh because you know he does
uh he's like hypnotherapists

[2:58:03]
uh he's like hypnotherapists
and
he does
a lot of like if you're having issues at
the table it's often from something off
uh and we ended up I think doing most of

[2:58:16]
uh and we ended up I think doing most of
our sessions like not about poker at all
they were about
personal
stuff from the past like
most of the sessions
so

[2:58:30]
so
that I mean he helped me an incredible
amount
life-wise and that obviously translates
to poker in terms of being happier and
more confident off the tables and
getting rid of these big issues that are
causing like anxiety or unhapp
unhappiness make you perform better

[2:58:48]
unhappiness make you perform better
um
but
yeah I think for a lot of
um for my actual like
working at poker I

[2:59:01]
working at poker I
didn't I I didn't have
[Music]
um
yeah I didn't have like
someone in that sense for for most of it

[2:59:15]
someone in that sense for for most of it
um
I actually just started working with
someone a little recently
um well like this week
um we had our first session
for
just some like you said like habit stuff

[2:59:31]
just some like you said like habit stuff
of consistency with
sleep and stuff so I'll see how
see how that goes I'm feeling positive
about it at the moment but um yeah I
think in the past it was a lot of my own
stuff and like the work ethic which I

[2:59:46]
stuff and like the work ethic which I
think is the important part came from
University and College of just being
like you know
kind of had the habit of putting hard
work in
um
and then I think just talking to people

[3:00:01]
and then I think just talking to people
like a lot of people
that I play with
are kind of always looking out for
habits and stuff and you know so you
speak to people in here
different things

[3:00:15]
different things
um
I think I think that's maybe progressed
more in poker over the last five or six
years of you know before it used to be
just more like gambling and
we just show up and play and if we're
tired who cares and
you know

[3:00:30]
you know
if we were drinking who cares and I
think these days people are a bit more
focused on the off-table stuff that can
make a difference
um
so yeah well I think I've been buying
with that stuff
[Music]

[3:00:45]
[Music]
um
I think there's definitely like always
room for improvement with that stuff
which is you know partly why I started
uh
yeah looking recently for for more
things to improve on that front
yeah so sounds like the sessions were

[3:01:01]
yeah so sounds like the sessions were
Elliot in particular we're looking at
some of the kind of past events in your
life that we're creating a little bit of
a sadness or negative emotions I think
you mentioned earlier that a lot of the
time you were playing poker to escape
some of those villains so so to speak

[3:01:15]
some of those villains so so to speak
even though it wasn't necessarily uh
affecting your performance directly
maybe not in the short term there was
still some underlying issues that you
needed to do some work and resolve and
then the podcast it sounds like speaking
with other players has been very
beneficial for you in terms of great
approaches dealing with variants also
obviously yourself from mathematic

[3:01:31]
obviously yourself from mathematic
backgrounds you've talked about having
like kind of good Frameworks for
understanding numbers variants and you
know to uh maybe emotionally deal with
some of the challenges being a poker
player I know like one of the challenges
of Poker is you feel like you're the
only person going for the problems and

[3:01:45]
only person going for the problems and
then when you speak with the players
regularly like you do yourself you
realize ah other players are going
through very similar problems I'm the
only person of self-doubt I don't know
personalize these frustrations it's
anxiety these everyone else is
navigating similar problems and then you
around successful players like you are
you you guys oh there's a lot of us like

[3:02:01]
you you guys oh there's a lot of us like
good club strategies good habits good
ways of showing up that allow us to deal
with this very volatile Pocket World I
think if you try and solve all those
things alone you end up like just not
going crazy but you end up like all the
problems get compounded because you
think like you're so isolated from stuff
but once you're speaking with players

[3:02:15]
but once you're speaking with players
regularly uh whether it's a coach or
whether it's just break other players
you can get a lot of insights into uh
how to deal with all the problems so I'm
curious to know for you in terms of
habits that have been most beneficial
work ethic obviously is a very
um a kind of current going through this
conversation but in terms of habits you
do regularly that allow you to form your

[3:02:31]
do regularly that allow you to form your
best because it's a basis what are some
of the things you you value or do
uh
I mean I think one of the things I
changed over the last few years was uh
not no drinking on trips
which

[3:02:45]
which
I was like
had some issues with drinking when I was
younger and
uh
during like those times of the first
years when I wasn't very happy he was
drinking a lot
uh and then

[3:03:00]
uh and then
even when I kind of got a hold of it a
bit more I was still we still just drink
on the trips kind of to relax and just
out of habit and recently I have kind of
been more aware of the effect it has in
my sleep
and just kind of have

[3:03:15]
and just kind of have
uh
you know every now and then well if I
slip up or maybe if I have a day off
when I feel like even for the most part
now I do like four days before every
trip and then

[3:03:33]
um the whole trip until the last night I
just won't have any alcohol
uh and I feel like that's had quite a
bit effect and just
you know the trips are exhausting and
hard to recover anyway so not then

[3:03:46]
hard to recover anyway so not then
putting that extra burden of yourself of
alcohol ruining
your sleep uh has been very helpful
um
food I think has been very helpful as
well I'm much more mindful these days of

[3:04:01]
well I'm much more mindful these days of
like I pack I just like pack good food
with me uh it's hard at some of the
stops because I'm vegan like some of the
stops don't have great food options for
me so I'm kind of forced to but also
just means I eat healthier like I'll

[3:04:15]
just means I eat healthier like I'll
take
some
food
you know uh and go a day early and like
make sure I can get to a supermarket and
I
most of the time if I can get Apartments
not hotels so I can cook

[3:04:31]
um and I think having that is like
because sometimes you just get these
terrible food options or trips and if
you're just ending up eating badly you
just end up really sluggish and just
like not feeling great by day four of a
day over like an 11 day trip

[3:04:45]
day over like an 11 day trip
uh
so I think that's very helpful
um
and then I think like a warm-up routine
I I used to one of the things I like
about staying in apartments actually I
think I used to stay in the venue a lot

[3:05:02]
had a thing where I would just like wake
up at 11 40 grab a coffee and be playing
by 12.
and you haven't really had any time to
know whether you're even thinking well
that day these days I try and wake up

[3:05:16]
that day these days I try and wake up
like at least two hours before the games
and then do something either study poker
a bit or just play something like chess
and just be like before I play today
am I awake like am I play am I thinking
well because you can sometimes see like

[3:05:30]
well because you can sometimes see like
sometimes you wake up you didn't sleep
great you played chess
and you're like I'm not gonna play poker
12 of this is how I'm playing chess like
uh or you know you wake up and you
play poker against the trainer or you

[3:05:45]
play poker against the trainer or you
study poker and you're like barely
looking at the Sim and
you know I think those days
maybe at the start of my career looking
back if I tested myself there would have
been a lot of those days but now I kind

[3:06:00]
been a lot of those days but now I kind
of try and make sure I get to sleep by a
certain time not just stay up and do
things you know it's very easy like at
home sometimes if you want to stay up
and watch a film till 4am or something
it's very easy to and you don't get that
punished for it the next day maybe you
just don't study as much
uh so like not doing that stuff on trips

[3:06:17]
uh so like not doing that stuff on trips
just being like hey I got home it's 12
30. I need to be asleep by two
to wake up at 10. and the game start at
12 30.
uh so I think having that more just like

[3:06:32]
uh
maybe I mean I mean maybe it's just all
around like intention of just going to
the trips with the intention to perform
well whereas it used to be a bit more
like oh it's a holiday and like I'm
gonna go and play some poker
and have some fun playing poker whereas

[3:06:46]
and have some fun playing poker whereas
these days it's like no you know I get
five months a year of these trips
the games are big and I want to play
well and like doing the things that you
know will make you play well which are
just different for every person it's not
like I can you know I think there's some
general stuff like

[3:07:00]
general stuff like
not drinking a lot and trying to get
sleep I don't think is going to be
something that's like that argued about
whether those are good for most people
but you know there are some things that
I do that other people like some people
I know really like the hotels and find

[3:07:16]
I know really like the hotels and find
that convenient and you know I like
having an apartment and being able to
cook myself
uh but I think all of it for certain
people is just
matching your intention with
your aim I guess because some people you
speak to it's like what's your aim in

[3:07:31]
speak to it's like what's your aim in
poker and they're like oh I would like
to be top 50 in the world at some point
and then you're like okay what are you
like these trips where maybe there's
five ebts a year where you get to play
the higher Stakes like what do you do on

[3:07:46]
the higher Stakes like what do you do on
them and they're like oh I like you know
go out with friends
four out of the ten nights and you're
like okay this like these two things
don't really align
uh like something's
something's missing or has gone wrong at
some point so

[3:08:01]
some point so
yeah I think it's like different things
that work for me but I would guess the
the thing that would link it for
everyone is just
you know showing up and just making sure

[3:08:15]
you know showing up and just making sure
your actions are
for the most part aligned with what you
want to get out of it
I like that great advice and I like the
intentionality creates the kind of
actions you take from that so the
intention is to play your best podcast
very quickly you start looking at

[3:08:32]
very quickly you start looking at
lifestyle factors that impact out you
look at sleep you look at diet you look
at War routines because you know they're
gonna make you feel better and perform
better on average and just imagine
alcohol and sleep
I've been trying my sleep with the whip
tracker which is a wearable device

[3:08:45]
tracker which is a wearable device
there's aura rings as well very similar
I've got four years of data and it's
just quite black and white for me at
this stage that alcohol affects
personally my recovery way more than any
other variable more than late at night
screen time anything else like almost
like I think every drink cost me four

[3:09:00]
like I think every drink cost me four
percent recovery on average so it
compounds quite quickly and it's here
for myself now I'm very mindful of when
I drink if I need to perform anything
currency I need to be sharp I need to do
good gym sessions our girl's just a
no-go on those environments because like
I said the intention is I know that it

[3:09:15]
I said the intention is I know that it
cost me so much in recovery am I willing
to pay that price and once you've got
that kind of intentionality very clear
and you know the data like from the
alcohol does come at a cost in terms of
recovery and how I feel almost anxiety
and a lot of stuff for the brain if you
guys want to go deep on alcohol and the

[3:09:30]
guys want to go deep on alcohol and the
brand there's a great podcast by Andrew
huberman he's like three hours on
alcohol and its effects on brand
performance and everything if you want
to scare yourself from drinking when
you're trying to perform cognitively but
I think it's good to link those together
and then it comes back quite clear okay
create rules for yourself now you do

[3:09:45]
create rules for yourself now you do
five trips in the air it comes in quite
a clear boundary you're going all right
drinking doesn't align with these trips
I can still drink with friends I still
do it other times but on these trips it
doesn't meet the attention and yeah I
think that's a really really good thing
to get alignments obviously if other
players are going to have a good time or
to socialize or it's one of their trips

[3:10:02]
to socialize or it's one of their trips
away of the year like it was early for
you and Charlie then fair enough that
maybe you can create different rules but
having clear intention then creating
rules around that so in terms of an edge
your lifestyle gives you let's say um
you're optimizing everything let's say
you're sleeping well you're eating well

[3:10:15]
you're sleeping well you're eating well
you're feeling well rested you're doing
good warm routines how much do you think
that impacts you in a positive aware
when you play and you feel like most
players in the high stakes games are
doing that these days or do you feel
like there's Edge to be had in the
competition from optimizing your own

[3:10:30]
competition from optimizing your own
lifestyle
uh
I think most most players at the high
stakes are doing that to some extent
just because it is tough and everyone's
aware that we're playing low Edge games
for a lot of money so

[3:10:47]
for a lot of money so
it's not like you can just like show up
and not
play your best
uh because you know the other people are
I think there's some people to less
extent like some people I know just play
very well when they're tired and

[3:11:02]
very well when they're tired and
they
maybe are slightly less worried about
this but uh
I think people these days are very
focused on like they know
which environments and which mindset

[3:11:17]
which environments and which mindset
they play well in and people are aware
that they need to put an effort into
being in that mindset when they play
yeah I think it's becoming more and more
clear at the higher levels in particular
it's very similar to sport these days

[3:11:30]
it's very similar to sport these days
where optimizing everything around
performance so you personally can
perform at your best in that environment
um it's becoming more more of a common
theme from from my interpretation Sophia
I want to write an example let's say
you're playing a day or two of a 50k or
100K and you wake up in the morning and

[3:11:46]
100K and you wake up in the morning and
they say you do your morning routine and
you start doing some play some chess and
I'll give you guys oh my mind is just
not working today and this is just gonna
be a tough day what do you do in that
time season hour before you need to be
the casino what would you do in our
window if you had to uh yeah busy your

[3:12:01]
window if you had to uh yeah busy your
mind wasn't working that moment to get
yourself ready to play
uh
I mean usually some exercise exercise
generally helps me feel slightly sharper
uh and then

[3:12:16]
uh and then
and then just some study like study of
hard spots so like I have spots noted
that I got wrong or misunderstood and
maybe just like review some of those so
you can see okay like another time I was

[3:12:33]
you can see okay like another time I was
tired I thought about poker this way
this is how it actually works like
remind myself to be slower and not do
the
you know I think when you're very tired
or not thinking that well your brain
goes to the intuitive like response

[3:12:46]
goes to the intuitive like response
and it's it's quite helpful sometimes to
look back at previous times where you
were playing
from intuition and got it wrong and just
remind yourself like
slow down this is not
it doesn't always lead to a good outcome

[3:13:01]
it doesn't always lead to a good outcome
like this is a time in the past where
you did that and this was the solution
uh so just kind of I mean I think that's
you know a big step of a big part of it
is that acknowledgment if you go and you

[3:13:15]
is that acknowledgment if you go and you
don't know that you're not gonna play
well or you don't realize how tired you
are it's harder once you've said all
right like you've identified oh I'm not
thinking that clearly today you're at
least aware and can be like okay make my
decisions a bit slower

[3:13:31]
decisions a bit slower
uh
you know maybe don't if you're like
you know maybe there's some lines
sometimes you take where you're like
this is a really tough line for both
people but I think I'm gonna perform
slightly better in this really tough

[3:13:46]
slightly better in this really tough
line than them
maybe don't do that this day because
maybe you won't perform slightly better
in that tough line than them or in your
in your b game so I think like you know
being aware that you're not
at your best is like a big step to

[3:14:01]
at your best is like a big step to
avoiding anything like that anyway
um but yeah I mean you know there is
kind of a limit to once you realize
you're not thinking that well and you
have an hour you're kind of in it and
that is
at that point you're like you know
that's where

[3:14:16]
that's where
you would hope they would have you know
that's what you're trying to avoid with
all the preparation right and like what
the stuff that you work on like that's
what you're trying to help people avoid
it's waking up and feeling that way
um once you're there you're a little

[3:14:30]
um once you're there you're a little
Scrooge in in some ways but yeah I think
being aware of it is a big is a big step
to
avoid yeah like you said terrible
outcomes yeah like you said obviously
prevention's the the main em but I'm
sure everyone finds himself in those
moments where they having a bad night's

[3:14:46]
moments where they having a bad night's
sleep for whatever reason they do feel
tired and it's time to perform you know
I like you the whole process you went
through was really really good because
first of all like you said you did went
for a process going through chess
originally then some hard spots and you
realize wait I'm tired and I'm not
thinking very clearly you then went to

[3:15:00]
thinking very clearly you then went to
increased activation in the body so you
exercise to get some blood flow going
get some adrenaline so too if your
physiology is a bit feeling a bit tired
you're almost like activating yourself
with exercise to get the body going you
then went through some tough spots where
you normally wouldn't be thinking when

[3:15:15]
you normally wouldn't be thinking when
you didn't think clearly you made
mistakes and you challenge yourself to
uh think hard in those spots again
almost like force and activation of the
mind so even though you're limited in
those moments like the process you went
through was really good because you give
yourself the best chance to get yourself
going against the body feeling better

[3:15:30]
going against the body feeling better
and also to get the Mind activated and
then you went to the casino always okay
I did all those things I still don't
feel fully rested I need to be very
mindful of what lines I'm taking game I
need to not take like super difficult
spots if I can avoid them maybe play a
bit slower and with that information

[3:15:45]
bit slower and with that information
you're doing lots of different things
where if someone didn't do that like you
said the old you made us walk up in the
morning not realize you're tired grab
the coffee you're playing at 12 o'clock
and you haven't realized all those
things that yeah maybe could have been
prevented if you yeah prepared better so
I think even though you're limited I

[3:16:00]
I think even though you're limited I
think that preparation process you
described there was really high level
and I think other players you know
McDonald's have a lot of success as well
all right Kristoff ready for yourself
you got any final questions and I've
been going quite quite a while so any
other questions you got to ask for Ben

[3:16:15]
other questions you got to ask for Ben
no um I think I've asked most of what I
wanted to ask I mean
we're having a great conversation I
could continue on for hours but they
need to be respectful of Ben's time as
well uh Ben
what about you would you have any final

[3:16:31]
what about you would you have any final
things that you would like to share with
our audience I remember we always ask
people like what are the goal and you
you mentioned that if you could help
some of the players educate some of the
players or you know motivate some of the
players listening uh that would be great

[3:16:46]
players listening uh that would be great
any any final words for them anything
that you would like to share
all right I think the I think the stuff
that I feel like is most valuable we
actually we actually covered uh
I mean yeah I guess to

[3:17:02]
I mean yeah I guess to
reiterate I think it is the the work
thing like putting in
the hard work is where
is where the returns are where you know
maybe everyone does the first 80 of the

[3:17:16]
maybe everyone does the first 80 of the
work
and
then like
how much of the last 20 you do
is what differentiates a lot of people
and the last 20 is the the toughest but

[3:17:32]
and the last 20 is the the toughest but
it's like outside returns
so you know maybe like 10 of the last 20
gets you the same as the first 80 in
terms of performance versus the field
uh
and

[3:17:45]
and
yeah I mean for me I feel like that's
the most important thing to focus on and
it's also the thing that we have most
control over so it feels like you know a
good thing to focus on
uh considering how much of Poker is not
in our control

[3:18:02]
going forward what is your uh what is
your plan in poker
uh
but now kind of carry on carry on with
this I've got you know Paris in six days

[3:18:16]
this I've got you know Paris in six days
and then Vietnam straight after and then
I think six weeks off before Monte Carlo
so it's just kind of the same routine
you know going uh they're kind of really
putting us through it now if Bahamas was
a long tough trip
then you know as Paris and then a

[3:18:31]
then you know as Paris and then a
17-hour travel day
straight into games two days later
and then yeah and then we get some
downtime before before summer so at the
moment for me and like
the next two just three years maybe or

[3:18:46]
the next two just three years maybe or
you know at least the next year or two
the the aim is kind of just
do what I'm doing at the moment I'm
enjoying the games I'm playing and
enjoying studying for them so
uh

[3:19:01]
uh
yeah there's no not like a huge aim of
where to get to or what to change just
uh
yeah yeah I mean you cannot really go
higher you cannot really go against
tougher opponents so

[3:19:15]
tougher opponents so
yeah that then it's always interesting
because I can imagine a lot get crushed
yeah exactly but like a lot of time you
know in your career probably also when
you were lower you look up right you
have something to work towards and then
sometimes when you actually get there
there's like what next but you don't
really have like what next you're happy

[3:19:31]
really have like what next you're happy
with the life that you're currently
living on a on a day-to-day basis that's
kind of what drives you forward or or
maybe I should rephrase this to a
question what keeps what what keeps you
motivated to keep on working on your
game and staying on top because usually

[3:19:45]
game and staying on top because usually
to get to the top is is sort of easier
you get driven and it's nicer than
staying on top
uh yeah I mean I think the the what's
next is not

[3:20:01]
completely true
like what you're saying of like you know
there's nothing to look up to I think I
just say in the sense of
okay like I can play against
the
top guys now in a year they will be

[3:20:17]
top guys now in a year they will be
better can I play in those games
right now I couldn't play no like I can
compete now in the games I'm playing at
if I
didn't play free like if I played at my
current level and you just fast

[3:20:30]
current level and you just fast
forwarded everyone and
to how good they'll be in a year
I would probably lose in those games
and I kind of see that as the what's
next like interesting so you're kind of
motivated by the future
yeah I mean it's going to be different

[3:20:45]
yeah I mean it's going to be different
games in the future everyone's working
hard it people are improving so much
year to year like
can I compete in those games you know
you don't you don't know uh just like
before when you know you were playing
10ks and you don't know whether you'll

[3:21:01]
10ks and you don't know whether you'll
be able to beat 25k's it's like
am I still going to be able to perform
in a year's time at the new level that
people are playing at
[Music]
reflectively speaking like if you look

[3:21:16]
reflectively speaking like if you look
at the head one year from now what do
you think is the main area that needs
improving
that you're gonna work on in the next in
the next year
or so in order to be ready for the games
from a year from now

[3:21:31]
I mean I think
I don't know if it's split as much as
maybe some people say in terms of uh
again maybe some of that is the more
like polarized you know coaching site

[3:21:46]
like polarized you know coaching site
YouTube stuff of like this is the area
like you need to work on I think a lot
of the time it's just like your own
mistakes you know they're just like
go through your I will just go through
my mistakes of the trip and just be like
okay where did I lose the most dollar EV

[3:22:01]
okay where did I lose the most dollar EV
in terms of
how much are these mistakes worth and
how often did I make them at health and
do they come up and fix those and like I
don't know what they'll be in a year for
me but I don't think it's
you know necessarily as easy as like

[3:22:17]
you know necessarily as easy as like
uh
you know
I need to study this whole area I think
people are generally like very good at
poker these days and most areas are
getting pretty high level and you just
need to
address your weakest parts

[3:22:32]
address your weakest parts
no that makes a lot of sense right you
study based you basically you already
looked at the whole game Tree in a
certain way you have a very strong
Baseline now it's just optimizing where
apparently uh returning mistakes keep on

[3:22:47]
apparently uh returning mistakes keep on
occurring brush up that spot and that's
like I said right now it's slow
slow slow slow progress a little fix
here a little fix there a little fix
there there is no more uh one big aha

[3:23:01]
there there is no more uh one big aha
revolutionary strategy that's gonna give
you three percent extra Roi yeah
all right well then if Adam Adam do you
have any final questions
nope all good uh great conversation
thank you very much for your time Ben

[3:23:15]
thank you very much for your time Ben
really appreciate it I think the
audience are going to gain a lot from
this one so yeah thanks for sharing this
conversation yeah thanks for having me
it's been it's been fun thank you a lot
Ben for sharing your story and your
wisdom with our audience great
conversation Adam what were your main

[3:23:32]
conversation Adam what were your main
takeaways from our conversation we had
with Ben
the first takeaway came from early in
the conversation when he was talking
about his mathematics degree and he told
me the concept of going deeper and he
talked about University they had to
write proofs which are kind of had a

[3:23:46]
write proofs which are kind of had a
concept that he had to prove that was
correct and then he had to do three kind
of different
examples of hypothesis to prove a kind
of theory and basically the lesson he
learned from that was always go deeper
don't miss details I think these apply
this very well to Poco in terms of

[3:24:00]
this very well to Poco in terms of
looking at how strategies work on a
deeper level and they kind of zoomed out
big picture the ability to go deeper but
also like holistically see how a
strategy Works overall next thing I
think was really important from him was
his ability to take risk I think a lot
of people watching this might not relate

[3:24:15]
of people watching this might not relate
to his ability to uh almost go for it in
terms of
um high risk tolerance especially
earning his career going broke not
getting affected and also I think he's
learned how to not use that risk
tolerance in the right way he had that
Barcelona experience where he lost
Harvey's role and he realized oh wait a

[3:24:31]
Harvey's role and he realized oh wait a
second I can't be Reckless with taking
risks I'm gonna take uh risks it's been
a follower when it matters but I also
account yeah go too far without with
those risks or I'm going to lose on my
role so anyone who has a kind of risk
um taking backgrounds you need to find a

[3:24:47]
um taking backgrounds you need to find a
way to balance that so that you don't
want to take unnecessary risks that
brings me to the next one which is
self-awareness
I was thinking for a while to get to the
point where he said when things were
going badly that he would take a break
and I wanted to get to some sort of
thing that he did because I knew if

[3:25:01]
thing that he did because I knew if
someone's taking risks there put
themselves in volatile situations more
frequently than most people so they need
a cope mechanism to deal with things
going wrong here's one was to step away
from what he was doing and to learn work
hard and study the game so for him I

[3:25:15]
hard and study the game so for him I
think it took three months away from
player one time to redo his strategy and
to get better and this kind of mindset
was if I'm not good enough now no
worries I'll just get better I'll just
improve and get better so he was able to
take himself aware and improve which
takes me to the final point which was
what we ended on and if this is work

[3:25:32]
what we ended on and if this is work
ethic the ability to outwork people all
to put in the hard work and he said
everyone does the first items it's the
last 20 that are the toughest and that
most people aren't willing to do so this
comes back to the 80 20 principles where

[3:25:45]
comes back to the 80 20 principles where
the first 80 of kind of Rewards or
progress gets made in the first 20 of
efforts do you think of a curve it goes
up really steeply at the start and then
around the kind of 20 mark it levels off
and then from there it's generally a
very slow progression it's like

[3:26:01]
very slow progression it's like
incremental returns so it's hard work
it's solver work it's going deep on
strategies but this when you're at a
high level this is the path where most
people aren't willing to go on a
consistent with and be able to put that
hard work in to get those incremental
Improvement zones yeah I think if you

[3:26:15]
Improvement zones yeah I think if you
guys anyone who listens to this
conversation you'll definitely pick up
on the tone of being able to do the hard
things being up to the things that other
people aren't willing to do in terms of
looking deeply at strategies and yeah
doing the hard kind of solver database
analysis that gets them ahead I think

[3:26:30]
analysis that gets them ahead I think
when you're talking about the guys who
can play the super high rollers like Ben
you've got to be the kind of exception
who's willing to go deep with other
people aren't and yeah I think that's
definitely been a kind of principle of
his I think maybe it's a trailer first
being a hard working but it sounds like

[3:26:45]
being a hard working but it sounds like
definitely through University he kind of
fine-tuned that skill and I'm almost
sure I threw polka he's learned to
develop the work like epic needed to
succeed like at a high higher level so
if you guys are lack of work ethic in
the short term it's definitely a
trainable Trend that you can get better
at and yeah you can definitely learn to

[3:27:02]
at and yeah you can definitely learn to
increase your right but how about
yourself right now what are some of the
main takeaways you've wrote down
I mean yeah he talked about work ethic
and work hard but it's mainly also
working efficient right I mean in those
periods where you kind of isolated
himself to study he said I wasn't

[3:27:15]
himself to study he said I wasn't
studying eight hours a day like that
won't be efficient so he was taking more
time off I think he mentioned he was
doing cycling uh climbing and doing
studying so he was also like basically
listening himself from a situation so
also so he didn't burn out I think he
mentioned this as well right to kind of

[3:27:31]
mentioned this as well right to kind of
uh control uh control controls energy
and his emotions so I think the
efficiency that was kind of my main
takeaway it's very easy to say I work
hard I work hard I grind hard but is it
really efficient he also talked about uh

[3:27:45]
really efficient he also talked about uh
in terms of efficiency you talked okay
if you have a certain goal or if you
wanna I think he mentioned if you want
to be the top 50 are your habits in line
with becoming to that top 50 right so
maybe you know just working your ass off
but not in an efficient way or maybe

[3:28:00]
but not in an efficient way or maybe
doing what the rest is doing and I think
they also mentioned that yeah if you
don't change you will get what you had
before and it's the same as you do what
everything does you will get what
everything had everyone has so sometimes
you also have to do things differently
and I think he's a good example of that

[3:28:15]
and I think he's a good example of that
in the example that you gave he's
willing to go to to put in that little
bit extra where the majority stops right
that's how you become exceptionally good
I indeed also thought it was interesting
how his relationship with risk but I
think also like his confidence in

[3:28:30]
think also like his confidence in
in making it in the end I think we
didn't touch on that much but he has a
very positive belief in the future and
that's also helped him be able to take
more risk I lost also like the free
romanticity that well you know if I

[3:28:45]
romanticity that well you know if I
think this life is good if I don't I
just make it back so if you have the
skill that was an important thing that
he mentioned if you have the skill and
if you have a high win rate at your
current game it's okay to take
aggressive shots because you know you'll
be able to just uh make it back and then

[3:29:00]
be able to just uh make it back and then
also like the compound effect of shots
going and well also if you do like some
mathematical models I'm no I'm not a
math guy but I I have done these kind of
things and the benefits of shot taking
off assuming that you're winning in the
game and like I said assuming that
you're winning in the game that you fall

[3:29:15]
you're winning in the game that you fall
back on so you can always make it back
it's always a good idea to take
aggressive shots right I think this is
also it helped him the fact that people
are always afraid of course to fail now
he failed many times in the beginning
even went broke and he realized that

[3:29:30]
even went broke and he realized that
even then he was okay so then if worst
case scenario you still feel fine then
worst case scenario is not that scary
anymore I think I believe this is a
stoic principle right that sometimes
voluntarily they put themselves in the
position where they sort of lose
everything just so that they know well
actually I lost everything

[3:29:47]
actually I lost everything
sort of right they faked it maybe for a
month just so they don't know that even
then life is still fine because often we
worry about losing things that are
actually not really that important if we
would actually take it away yes you know
it will not be the most pleasant

[3:30:00]
it will not be the most pleasant
experience but you know in the end we
will still do fine okay uh a little
technical part that I wrote down
pre-flop and entity is very important I
personally play cash games but I can
imagine that in mtts like it's it's uh

[3:30:15]
imagine that in mtts like it's it's uh
very important I think that was also
kind of the most common leaky saw with
students surprisingly it was like
actually it's just pretty Rob stuff so
maybe it's not the most sexy stuff and
that's why people kind of skip it
uh but I guess for empty deep players
losing out there or for cash game

[3:30:30]
losing out there or for cash game
players who are playing more amputees
definitely something to not neglect and
the last part that I wrote down was
future EV he mentioned that uh in your
20s if you have cold quote nothing
better to do you know and it doesn't
make you unhappy grind as hard as you

[3:30:45]
make you unhappy grind as hard as you
can so that you're in a position in life
later uh that you could take time off if
you would want to right that was a very
important point for example that I
missed in my 20s uh I was always like
yeah but I'm not gonna do nothing anyway
so why to hurry uh but obviously that is

[3:31:01]
so why to hurry uh but obviously that is
the difference luckily what I like what
I do I like what I like I do what I like
to do so it's not a problem but let's
say if any point uh I would not want to
be doing it unless I financially I
haven't set myself up because I've

[3:31:15]
haven't set myself up because I've
grinded my ass off uh then I might have
to continue even though I don't want to
so that would not be a great position so
I would definitely take that advice
don't burn yourself out don't don't
sacrifice everything don't live an
unhappy life uh find find a balance

[3:31:32]
unhappy life uh find find a balance
that's worked for you all right these
were our takeaways we have some more
guests lined up for you guys in the
upcoming weeks months that we're very
excited for I thought this conversation
was great so I want to thank bank again

[3:31:45]
was great so I want to thank bank again
Ben again and I want to thank Adam my
co-host for providing us with all his
knowledge again today I want to thank
the audience for tuning in again good
luck at the poker tables and I will see
you guys in the next
