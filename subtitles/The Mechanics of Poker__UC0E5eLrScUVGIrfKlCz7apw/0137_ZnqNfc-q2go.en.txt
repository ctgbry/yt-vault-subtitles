what's up guys
welcome to another episode
of the wacko show

[00:30]
of the wacko show
oh you got some playing cards with the
jared man
cannot refuse playing some card with the
jared man of course huh
jared man papa shus and gvl star

[00:46]
jared man papa shus and gvl star
that's what we call a lineup guys some
10 20 with gvl star jaredman and
papashash
i mean it doesn't get much better than
this i would say
i mean there's still a seat open

[01:02]
i mean there's still a seat open
let's see who joins that one well mr
german that the size of three vet
and we have a pretty looking hand so
obviously we're gonna be in

[01:15]
close versus half pot i would say
pew versus one third fold versus three
quarters
it checks

[01:30]
i don't mind a step skip with this ends
all the time
but i think
we have much other hands
they're better for stabbing like queen

[01:45]
they're better for stabbing like queen
and two that king nine suited
say i would have the spades
i wouldn't mind
i would not mind

[02:02]
checks again i think now we're gonna go
and check down mode i think the only
street you might consider betting is the
flop
i think days now we're just going to
check down
loose versus ace jack

[02:20]
could consider bluffing the river but i
think like i said the only street that
i think gets bad at a decent frequency
is probably flop obviously very
favorable

[02:30]
favorable
so i like my play there
don't think i'm gonna do too much
betting
he should probably do quite a lot of
leading especially if they then don't do
uh
or you know if he doesn't lead enough

[02:46]
or you know if he doesn't lead enough
the time
then
we should not be betting a whole lot
when checked on the turn and just check
behind a lot but i think exactly the 96
combo should be good or bad

[03:01]
here
we face i think we're gonna race
regardless
facing block
um
i still think we're going to race

[03:21]
trying to think of sizing
small sizing
i think a big sizing is fine

[03:36]
hey they tripped this morning when i was
playing
it's never nice

[03:45]
definitely going to continue betting
here probably going to mix small sizing
big sizing and i think sevens is the
finance to put in my small sizing
erases
i
think we have a call

[04:02]
actually to be fair sevens would have
actually maybe one of the hands that we
could have checked but
let's play it
i think i'm just going to call

[04:15]
interesting river
89 got there he checks
i think i'm going to make a little
knitty check here
especially with a 7
because like his turn blocks are gonna
contain a seven

[04:31]
contain a seven
so i don't think there's much value to
be gained yeah we touched the bullet
there
we touched the bullet there

[04:45]
as we would have lost more money

[05:01]
easy bet

[05:15]
is

[05:46]
river probably going to block with this
hand
i would say
and would definitely bat call

[06:01]
and would definitely bat call
king jack with a spade king queen with a
spade i'm gonna at fault i think this
one
let me think about that

[06:21]
should probably still call this some of
the time 95 square height number
you could have a screen with a spade so
space kind of go both ways

[06:32]
i'm gonna go for the call this time do
you want to make 2022
your greatest poker year ever
now i've done a webinar on how to do
that in our academy which we have made
available completely for free so go over

[06:48]
available completely for free so go over
to pokerambition.com
and let me help you achieve your goals
let's try it again guys let's try it
again
yeah dude

[07:02]
yeah dude
not this time

[07:20]
fold

[07:38]
okay
this is quite a good board for me
actually
not the end of the world

[07:51]
let's make a little sip
any fault
show to cart

[08:02]
in the face show them drunken style and
i think it's good for poker like bring
some fun enjoyment let's do it again
i think we can get it twice in a row
future okay i just gotta do it again

[08:21]
i did i did i did show it
seven
eight nine
ten jack straight

[08:31]
ten jack straight
yes it's a straight
that's a straight
let go what you do with the straight
check rays

[08:47]
unless he doesn't bite

[09:09]
i also play some 300 on acr but it's on
a non-bump-up table why would you do
that
why would you do that

[09:17]
why would you do that
why would you play a non-bump-up table
if you can play a bump-up table
this is what we call a very bad river
so i'm going to sneak out a bit though i
think
i don't think there's a lot of

[09:31]
i don't think there's a lot of
value to be gained in checking
i think it just falls on the person of
the turn
but we're entering quite thin territory
let me make this very clear

[09:49]
make a little donkey donkey
on the 259.

[10:02]
there's a raise i'm going to call here
with the pocket dates with the club
sixes actually would be better
i got sixes then eight

[10:16]
there's an interesting turn
let's see what force
should probably lead this some of the

[10:31]
should probably lead this some of the
time
half of the time seems fine
obviously would have preferred to have
pocket force with a club which i would

[10:45]
pocket force with a club which i would
probably play in a similar way same with
pakistan's
pocket sixes
that's a very interesting river
and should probably block again this
some of the time

[11:01]
all this dunking all this dunking you
[ __ ] dunk you do it again i remember
in a video before i've told you to not
dunk why do you do that why do you do

[11:16]
dunk why do you do that why do you do
this very bad run out for the german
oh but he did actually found the color
pocket queen shout out to the german
guys i'm going to jam for this sizing

[11:34]
and yes queens
which was way less likelier as i have a
screen
and we chop it up

[11:48]
would sometimes call sometimes jam
rolled high some
let's go for a gem that time

[12:10]
tree
should be quite a blank

[12:15]
i'm gonna go for over again
here we have a lot of action with aces
which is good

[12:36]
just gonna rip it in

[12:50]
thinking about it that's not good
as in then he is actually considering
foldering which we don't want of course
oh really wacko you don't want him

[13:00]
oh really wacko you don't want him
default we have aces really

[13:17]
he's thinking about it
and he's calling it up with king jack
off suit
that's what he was thinking about

[13:30]
that's what he was thinking about
the [ __ ]
son i would tell you this much son i
would never have put more 3000 with two
tons oh here we go i was gonna say
and here pocket sixes we trapped all the
way
and now it's time to ship it in

[13:53]
so he was thinking show me that beat the
wacko or maybe he just wanted to make it
to youtube well you made it to youtube

[14:00]
to youtube well you made it to youtube
son
congrats mr cozy
mate from the uk mate
we put this guy to the test
we opened got three way and we checked
three times

[14:23]
actually
fortunately he didn't bite
sad face but hey

[14:32]
sad face but hey
mr cozy here calling it off with the
king jack let's make it on by a hero
has to be said gotta give credit where
credit this jew
i think the five sticks are hard i think

[14:45]
i think the five sticks are hard i think
he should probably just see that but
actually he opened 3.5 so i thought
definitely going to race here
so i thought he should probably

[15:04]
uh
see that five and six is small but then
again he did open 3.5x so maybe actually
that's not true
here i think we have an easy fold

[15:16]
here i think we have an easy fold
where's this line
um
i also have our favorite hand here so
obviously three betting
actually we could have called as well
we check out here with the queen jack
suddenly we have a lot of action so
we're gonna dump this table

[15:33]
i'm gonna open bucket kings
choke choke choke choke choke yes

[15:46]
king queen he choked it
he choked it chicken song for him and
the money for us
[Music]

[16:01]
your middle c bat ski with the 5 6
suited
okay i would not have uh
it's a spot where we
could implement some

[16:18]
some small bats
shall we do it
i'm gonna do it
it's very gonna be very rare i think

[16:49]
now we're gonna use the jam and hope
strategy
i think ace five is a fine hero call for
him that's at least one hand that we're
blocking
oh what do you what hey

[17:01]
oh what do you what hey
he was actually thinking about it what
