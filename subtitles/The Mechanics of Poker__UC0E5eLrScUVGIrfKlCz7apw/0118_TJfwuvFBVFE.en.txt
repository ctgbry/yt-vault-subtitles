like this with that being said let's
dive into today's video what's up guys
by the end of this video you're gonna
know why you level yourself into bad
poker players now sure you've all been
there when you're in a river spot and
you're going back and forth between do i
call do i fold a part of you wants to do
it folds but then you hover over and you
click the call button just before you
click it or just as you're clicking it
you realize ah
should have folded
should have folded in hindsight you
realize it was a bad play so in this
video you're going to learn what happens
in those moments what what causes this
kind of
malfunction misfire of the brain and
more importantly how we can cope better
in these situations going forward all
right so
the first thing you need to understand
the first thing i want to put forward to
you guys
is that the mind can be in different
modes all right so the way i like to
explain it is we have two
minds that are particularly useful for
program one is the training mindset the
trainer mindset is analytical it's a
problem solver it likes to uh critique
things um it likes to uh yeah basically
solve problems analyze and use
scientific data and numbers to
solve stuff all right so i call it a
trainer mindset because this is perfect
when you're in the lab all right you're
studying poker then we have what i call
the performance mindset all right so the
second mode would be the performance
mindset and this one is very empty your
mind is very empty it is intuitive it's
creative it's go with the floor it's
accepted and it's calm all right so it's
more less thinking and more just going
with your kind of good feels all right
and i would argue strongly that if you
want to perform pocket at a very high
level you need to turn on the
performance mindset and get very good at
using your intuition and your your
judgments in the moment the analytical
mindset is much better at the away from
port tables all right so when you study
and learn the game you want that
function all right so first of all you
can bring two more to the analytical
modes so today we're gonna call it the
analytical modes and the intuitive mode
all right just to make it very clear
what we're talking about now the good
news is
when you're in the intuitive mode
leveling's done there's no leveling in
the intuitive mode game over all right
when you're going with your intuition
that's it that's all you need to do you
have solved the problem at the core root
level all right there's no overthinking
there's no level in you you've made the
right decision based on what you're
thinking in that moment all right so all
well and good thank you adam for solving
the problem so we're going to see when
your intuitive mods problem solved
however
very often we end up in the analytical
mode all right so the minds being
analytical and thinking all right so uh
we're going to address how to uh solve
the problem when the mind is already
starting to analyze all right so let's
say you're analyzing what is the next
thing that we need to be aware of the
next factor the next thing that comes
into play is your emotional state all
right you might wonder why why does my
emotional state
impact my logic should i'm using my
analytical minds why are my emotions
important and they're important because
your emotions impact you on every level
all right your emotions impact the
decision making process all right so
they intertwined you can't separate them
how you feel emotionally impacts how you
think all right and we're generally
making decisions based on what will feel
right all right even when you're using
logic we're based in it on how it feels
all right so our emotional state impacts
our decision making at a core level all
right so some emotional states you could
be going through uh it could be you
could be bored you could be frustrated
you could be angry or you could be alert
and energized all right so if you think
about those states
they don't affect your decision making
right if you're bored compared to angry
you're going to be thinking pretty
different right so this emotional state
is going to impact
how you play your hands all right so
we're going to get to the river and like
how we play spots and how we make
decisions but i want to give you guys
the framework all right we need to go
back go back a few steps and understand
the mechanisms what's happening in the
mind before we can actually solve the
problem all right so
right now we've got the emotional state
is impacting um your decisions and
understanding which emotional state
you're in all right from your emotional
state you then put on this big filter
all right you have a fill lab all right
and for today we're going to call it the
aggressive filter
and the passive delay all right and this
is happening subconsciously all right so
let's say um if i'm angry
i might subconsciously have an
aggressive filter or i don't say a
camera lens aggressive filter so
everything i see is through an
aggressive lens when i have the
aggressive filler on i want to call or i
want to raise all right it's simple i
want to be make aggressive lines as a
poker player all right so
when you're frustrated angry annoyed
often players will have a default
they'll have this aggressive butler
running in the background without even
realizing it's a subconscious program
should probably put it here for
subconscious all right so we've got this
aggressive filter on on the flip side we
can also have a pacifier and the passive
filter wants to fold all right so that's
germany when you're bored you're
disengaged you're not feeling like
taking risks maybe on a down swing you
you feel like your risk tolerance is
lower so now you're putting on this
pacifier all right you may be going well
how does this play out and
why why they need to know this stuff all
right so it's really important because
this is impacting how you think and what
decisions you make we feel like we're
making logical assessments of situations
but very often we've got filters running
that impacts how we actually make the
decision at the end so let's use an
example let's see here we've got
let's say we're in the analytical mode
we have a
frustrated state because we're not
things aren't going that well today and
our filter is aggressive filler all
right so you've got the aggressive fill
there over the top now when you have the
aggressive filter that impacts the
questions you ask yourself all right so
the aggressive filler
generally wants to call and wants to
raise as i said before so you're looking
for reasons to call you're looking for
reasons to be aggressive you don't want
to fault you don't want to be pushed
around you're sick of getting losing
you're sick of getting having to fall
and be pushed around so you ask yourself
questions say it's a river spot
you ask your questions like
what are these bluffs
what can i beat
what what have i seen this guy do before
so you ask a question that frames the
situation and then you're gonna get the
answer you're looking for so when you're
in the aggressive mode you ask questions
that generally
edge you towards the decision you want
to make all right so you're almost like
pre-biased
disposed to want to call i want to raise
in these moments so you ask the question
what's he bluffing what's he what what
can i beat and once he asks those
questions guess what the mind goes well
it could be bluffing this this this this
this and this you can be that he's bluff
this time and this time now you might
say oh awesome all right
well guess i should call in or should i
raise that and you might in that mode
all right so you've asked yourself a
question and as a result the decision
comes back call raise all right so
although it felt like a logical process
and you might analyze him because he had
a strong filter on there
you actually were biased towards a
certain action all right so in the
moment you might hit the call button but
then as soon as you hit it you realize
oh wait a second
i've been up i'm in an hour of freedom
of mine here it's got all these value
hands your mind just opens up sometimes
people have this moment where they click
the button i used to have this sometimes
just i'm clicking this i'm like actually
is that is that true oh or you
click it and then instant regret you're
like oh of course he's got the nuts
because the other nuts that makes
perfect sense you know he's never
bluffing there and you see that moment
all right so uh
and on the flip side we have the other
filler right so the pacifier so let's
see uh
your
inaudible mod and your
board your board or you're yeah you see
you're disconnected you just disengage
from the games you're playing and you're
in passive mode now a spot comes down on
the river and it's a big pot maybe the
opponent double parts
best the river over over all the bed
jams it and you've got a bluff catch in
hand
and your thought that says
i don't want to get in a big pot
i don't want to make a mistake i don't
want it i don't know what he's got here
he must have it so the question you then
ask yourself is
what is value hands what what can't i
beat
what what what's these nutty combos and
as soon as you ask that the mango was
he's got this little combo there's no
combo there's not a combo
you can't be this you can't be that you
can't be that boom are you all right
yeah fold all right and you made that
full button all right so uh what i'm
trying to show you guys here is that the
mind is very complex and it's in these
different levels all right so if we look
at it from the from the outside we've
got the mods all right so if when the
intuitive modes or the analytical modes
very quickly we're going to be able to
make good decisions because we're not
going to be overthinking stuff if we're
in the analytical modes from there
branches your emotional state all right
there's loads emotional states from
angry frustrated annoyed happy calm
whatever all right that emotional state
will then impact a subconscious filter
that you're running all right it's a
picture for yourself when you've made
some bad decisions what filter was
running for you often if a player is the
one that's most noticeable is the
aggressive villa all right in generally
emotions like frustration and anger have
a big impact on your decision making all
right so you're gonna be frustrated
you're gonna be angry or you just feel a
bit annoyed that things aren't going
your way you then have a tendency or
something a lot of players do have a
tendency to want to play aggressive in
those moments to fight back to want to
call and if you look at that and you
stop what you'll see is in those moments
you'll ask yourself very leading
questions what is he bluffing what can i
beat what what's my range look like here
and how can i manipulate the situation
so to make myself call and then you'll
make the decision that is already
pre-decided that you basically want to
call arrays all right so what's
interesting here is first of all
we've got many like kind of punch of
attack all right many points to kind of
fix the problem first of all is to uh
get good at using your intuition all
right i'm much better at not
overthinking and building confidence
obviously
as a poker player as you're moving the
mistakes you're improving depending on
where you are you're out on your journey
sometimes the mind's gonna be very
active all right it's really hard to
switch it off and you're going to use a
lot of analytical thinking in as you
play it all right so let's say you are
analyzing you you can't get your
intuition that often at the moment then
we need to look at your emotional state
all right and understand that certain
emotional states are going to cause you
to use these different form of kind of
biases all right so if you're angry if
you're frustrated you might want to you
might be turning on the aggressive
filter all right so what you want to do
here is you want to counter it you want
to counter your default filter
with the invis all right so let me
explain this so let's say you're in the
aggressive mode you're feeling angry and
you're using your aggressive filter and
you're asking yourself the question
what are his blobs
you instantly want to counter that with
what are his value hands all right you
want to create another argument so the
mind doesn't go down one side all right
it doesn't go one into one kind of chain
of thought now obviously in this process
you are going to go back and forth but
the main thing is in in this kind of
leveling process you want to have
accurate representation as best as
possible you want to have a kind of
neutral the pros and cons pros and cons
list you want all the cons you don't
want all the pros you want to really be
able to logically think about the
situation correctly so ask yourself when
you see yourself asking for his bluffs
instantly count now with one of his
value hands you know the flip side if
you're in the passive frame of mind and
you see yourself asking yourself um
what was his value hands ask yourself
what is bluffs right so counter it to go
for the inverse of the might if what the
kind of the let's see it all right this
happens the philosophically subconscious
but watch yourself when you're asking
yourself questions and pay attention all
right so it's not to be a bit of a
scientist in your own life after
watching this video
pay attention how your emotional states
turn on these filters and have a look at
what questions you ask yourself and how
that misleads you
now i had a call with a coaching client
yesterday and he was saying he
fights this battle all right this battle
between his intuition and his analytical
minds he says i want to use my intuition
but then i also want to use my
analytical minds to figure out what i'm
doing and then use the best decision all
right and he was trying to ask me which
one do i use which would go with my
intuition all my analytical minds and
how can i stop myself using my a little
combined
and my kind of solution to this was
basically if you're using your intuition
you go with it straight away all right
so intuition's a quick quick process you
feel it you think about it you go all
right as soon as you stop that process
and go oh i feel like i should fall but
let me check with the analytical minds
that puts it up into this prefrontal
cortex the conscious part of your mind
that starts analyzing it as soon as
analytical mind takes over you can't
just go back to your intuition all right
and the reason for this is the
analytical mind is very logical and very
data-driven whereas intuition is very
field-based and when it comes to like a
kind of a discussion in the
prefrontal cortex and the logic about
the minds
intuition loses intuition's got no no
arguments all right so the other command
goes ah intuition push that aside i know
better all right so if you see yourself
doing this and you you have a good
feeling that should be a call or a fold
and you see yourself second-guessing
yourself and thinking it this is what's
happening you have an intuitive feeling
to go with you ignore that in the short
term to give yourself more time to think
then as soon as i think it takes over
you can't go back with that good feeling
all right and now you're going to use
your logic to decide
all right so that's what happens when
you level yourself hopefully i'll give
you a little tool to use there to watch
it so from this video on pay attention
to what mode you're in first of all
analytical modes or intuitive modes you
can intuitive mode game over you win if
you're in the um analytical mode pay
attention to your your state of mind
your emotional state if you're in a
heightened emotional state you may be
more aggressive pay attention to your
default tendencies if you're in a lower
emotional state like board you may be
more passive states and then watch how
the mind uses those filters to ask very
leading questions all right when you see
your mind doing that counter it with the
opposite if you see yourself asking one
of these bluffs ask yourself what is
value hands and vice versa all right so
this is really fundamental because we
don't realize how illogical we are at
times we think we're making logical
decisions when in reality the brain's
using a really really strong filter and
a bias we feel like calling because
we're in that aggressive mode so we call
all right and i want you guys to have a
better framework and bill to tackle this
at the root level so if that was helpful
drop a comment below to let me know how
the analytical mind causes problems for
you maybe share a hand or a spot where
you overthought it and as a result i
made a mistake and i'd love to know your
insights on that all right guys thanks
