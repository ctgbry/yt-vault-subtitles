if you make a mistake in poker it can be
a technical mistake because you like
technical knowledge
usually then even after you play the
hand you know you're not sure
or it's like oh i think i played his
hand fine but mental mistakes kind of
happen when
directly after the hand you already know
ah [ __ ] why why did i do that then you
clearly missed something
and that's what you have to analyze how
do you do that

fans and welcome back to another video
here at the poker ambition channel
in which today i'm going to be reviewing
a hand that i played on stream where we
made
very nitty nitty nitty hero fold for
which we played the chicken song for
ourselves
and i'm going to make a small analysis
to
kind of see if the hero fault was
correct that's one
and if not kind of try to figure out
why or where in my thought process i
went wrong that made me made a wrong
hero full
and as always guys if you like this
video give it a thumbs up leave a
comment down below and
follow the channel and without further
ado let's get into the hand
so here we have the hand we
are streaming on the waco show for
people who have never been to a weka
show it's live on twitch
and we flopped and we flopped
as i just stated in french sorry french
people
don't mean this in a bad way i just like
saying
when i have two pair i just like saying
de pere yeah it's just a thing
thing that we have what you gonna do
what you gonna do when you have to pair
i'm gonna call
and you know it's usually poker is quite
easy when you don't have a hand because
it's just like
do i blow for do i not bluff but when
you have a good answer do i slow play do
i check race
do i do this so we decided to go for the
check call
okay it's go again and turn you can
still be
value betting worse in terms of maybe
ace queen
maybe some a stance suited
so yeah as i just said he's going to
turn i don't think check raising
is going to be a thing we started to
handle a little bit deeper which
is important uh as this was also i think
one of the reasons why i was leaning
towards a
fold on the river people are now like
what the [ __ ] wacko did you fall to bear
i've seen you stationed quite hard yeah
i know i don't know what's happening
either i was in a very nitty mood
so let's see what happens so i think
also if you get check race maybe at 100
bb i think it's a fine check race
you know you can make him fall like i
don't know i had like
10 9 or something but it's only a gutter
um
you know you can now get maximum value
out of ace 10 a screen maybe get caught
by a flush draw
so i would say 100 bb i don't mind the
checkers on the turn
easy call not sure if
he's gonna value bad ace queen on the
river though so that's gonna be
interesting
so this i think is the first interesting
spot you hear me say i don't think he's
going to value that ace queen on the
river so i'm clearly looking okay
he's still gonna bat um do i have a
bluff catcher is he still betting worse
so this is like the first the first
point where you can see my thought
process going i'm already not that happy
with the spot
he goes in the tank and eventually
shoves for 126
pot
i am not happy as you can clearly see
this is not really a spot that gets
bluffed all that often
so the first birth point was i don't
think he's value betting as queen
anymore second point is i don't think
this is a spot that gets blood very
often
for multiple reasons
jack space check you can clearly see i'm
not playing
i'm not playing gto here as we have a
very good blocker to
obviously his value bats that's
significantly reduced
um and we're not really blocking his
main blocks which like i said are
probably gonna have to be
a frequency through that preflop like
108 off suit or something
jack suit do you have ace queen
i'm actually going to make a very neat
default i'm not really feeding this one
i am not really feeding this one
so the weka wasn't really feeding this
one and now obviously the question is
well how can we figure out what was
indeed the correct play
first step is always let's look what is
gto just to confirm i don't think it's
ever going to be a fault but
let's just look at what gto is supposed
to do
so here we have the sim let's start off
with the root
it's kind of my call range small band
versus a big blind three bet
with something maybe four bet these
hands that's why it's at a frequency
same with these holdings i would
sometimes forbade
we check and this is his strategy
you can see actually we're not see
betting as the big blind
at a very high frequency it's around 50
actually the sizing that you use is
actually also not the preferred gto
sizing but if you would use this sizing
this is kind of what the strategy should
look like
and we can see in terms of bluffs the
big blank in general
three bet a little bit more of a
polarized range than for example if you
would play color versus
mp okay then bluffs usually are kind of
in the region of like some trashy aces
some trashy kings
some middling hands like these that have
okay
ish playability post flop and like some
suited hands like
10 10 x jack x 9 x that
are not so good as like 8 6
because a6 just it does very well as
calling so it usually goes like one step
to the right for a bit more trashy hands
and then obviously we have the value
region and in this region like some
people prefer to three by these hands
some people don't
so usually i like to work with
frequencies same with the bluffs like
i'll just give i think like 35 percent
frequency to all of these hands so that
we don't get into a post-op scenario
where
for example if i always give him 10 off
or never give him 10 and off
which in this example for example would
be quite a relevant difference
that will really screw up the tree right
so approximately
18 percent extreme bet which i think is
reasonably gto
so he starts up with a bat and in gto we
are mainly calling h3 so
on the flop we played quote quote
correct versus
the correct strategy we call
turn is the king of clubs i actually i
seemed the hand already at a deeper
stack size and i made the sim only use
the sizing that our
villain would be using for example again
the one third and now the three quarters
i don't think it's the
preferred bad size scheme in gto
probably we would see bigger here and
after half potting maybe like a big bet
on the turn
but after one third i think if we're now
in this scenario we would definitely
prefer to bad pot
so let's see what kind of hands he
should be picking
and let's see if that's relevant you
should actually sometimes strap aces
trap king jack this you know
aces i guess could be happening i think
if people trap aces unless they decide
that they're just going to arrange the
bet
they probably trapped the flop though
king jack i see most likely people are
barreling
um h3 offsuit actually is the hand
that's in there and this is actually a
little spoiler alert one of the hands
that i didn't consider
when evaluating the hand same for the
king jack i was clearly
i thought that i was in a bluff catch
scenario in a spot that i didn't think
would get bluffed enough
if we look also at hands we see like
some seven six
in the mix which is completely nothing
okay this is actually also something
that i considered in game that i thought
a lot of his blood should come from a
lot of
yeah the yolo the yolo bluffs like the
seven
six and again you know i don't think
your average opponent
finds uh finds the seven six all that
often
logical bluffs for for for the turn for
villain would be indeed like the queen
and after 10 and of the 108.10 seven off
type of holdings
probably often with a club as you can
see the club is the dominant barreling
hand as we can jam a little bit more
rivers and we block like some folds so
we have direct fault equity a little bit
more often
so he bets we are always calling
never raising as i suggested i don't
think we will do much raising on this
turn
and calls and remember is a deuce
actually a deuce is not a blank
okay as four or five suited now makes it
straight and this
is going to be the strategy of
imposition so he's going to be jamming
for
around 100 big blinds because like i
said we're a little bit deeper
he's never betting a screen so that
estimation was indeed correct
his bluff should now mainly come from
the
10 9 10 8 and 7. the problem though is
that
we usually only barrel them with a club
and people usually like to give up clubs
on the river
so if people are not aware
of this they might if they only barrel
clubs on the turns of the tenant and off
the queen enough to clean it off with a
club
and don't fall bluff clubs on the river
they will end up having no bluffs
basically this is a problem
combinatorically narrows his value range
of taunton um
could create a bluffing imbalance if
he's not very careful
we can see the five four being in there
again the five sixty six seven and seven
eight are gonna be bluffs at the highest
frequency
also the ten five to ten four this
probably has something to do with the
fact that it's uh
uh probably that we are always calling
h5
due to blocking a straight for example
ace five is four yeah these are
dominated
are our primary calls in terms of ace
x so blocking our calls would make
the bluff work a little bit more often
that's why 10 4 and then 5 are so
dominant
and we can now see that
ace 4 a3 so actually h4 is making around
2bb a little bit less
and a3 the two pair is actually making
around
okay so apparently the suits are quite
important nothing in practice this
really matters all that much so let's
say the average
we made around 4bb on a call so i would
say actually the call
maybe some people are now like oh
actually i expected us to make way more
so you can see actually already in gto
to call
you know it is a call but it's not like
we have
uh um oh actually king jack the two pair
is actually a very bad call
it doesn't really make much his queen
also doesn't really make much yeah it's
not it's not an ace jack where we make
uh
40 bb okay so the goal is already
marginal ish
another very easy way i like to
just evaluate a river call is to use
a program like equilab or poker ranger
which is this program over here
i already put it in our hands i put it
in
bluffing combinations and i put it in
the board and
it's as simple as on the river i'm gonna
i'm gonna cheat now
he's uh he's betting over the pot we
need 36
equity to call and in this estimation i
have around 38
equity so you could say that then we
have to call
and i gave him king jack i let him
sometimes check the flop with kings
and again like i said the blast has to
kind of come from these hands so it's
also very dicey
if he's always three betting this hand
then if he see bets them then if he
always barrels them then if he bears
there's a lot of ifs right but
you know starting off with eight combos
and then
two combos jamming the river i don't
think it's that unfair like i said the
10 510 for suited always jamming
especially the diamonds and the clubs
um five four suited got there like i
said the deuce is definitely not a blank
guys
um and obviously the h3
so then you could see that we have a
break even-ish call
um in-game i kind of estimated the
situation to be more like this
then we have 33 which is three percent
not enough
so then we actually would have a fault
um
but i don't think this is true obviously
he has
he's gonna have history off some of the
time he's gonna have king jack suited
some of the time
so this is clearly a spot
that i've i think misplayed i think it's
a call it's not
as slammed on call as people might have
thought
uh let's say for example the hand was
just on the bb we only have to be right
uh you know significantly less so then
it's a
an easy call but due to this text size
and due to the fact that i just think
this spot is not really spot that people
it's a spot where people i think easier
lean towards under bluffing than over
bluffing
i made the tight fold but there was
clearly a mistake in my thought process
so if we conclude that technically
you know it was clearly a call it's
apparently a mental mistake and i want
to kind of go
through how to get to the root of a
mental
mistake if you make a mistake in poker
it can be a technical mistake because
you like technical knowledge usually
then even after you play the hand you
know you're not sure or it's like oh i
think i played his hand fine
but mental mistakes kind of hand happen
when directly after the end you already
know ah
[ __ ] why did that do that then you
clearly missed something
and that's what you have to analyze how
do you do that
you do a mental health history this is a
concept popularized by jared tender
a very excellent mental game coach
worked a lot with him
and he's helped me a lot in my poker
career including this process and this
is something that i often do with hands
so basically you're gonna go and analyze
how your thought process was and look
for where you made the mistake
and look if that's a tendency or
a way of thinking that often leads to
mistakes so we can correct that and
prevent more mistakes like this in the
future so step one describe what went
wrong in the hand aka what is the
problem
well the problem is that we made a fault
that was incorrect
okay as well in gto as well as in
practice
the second step is because we always
what we do in game okay we're not gonna
go uh gordon
why do you do this [ __ ] all the time all
the
[ __ ] time i teach you don't do those
gay bets
why do you have to do it why
i don't get it why instead of shouting
at your students maybe there's a coach
walking you have to ask yourself okay
i'm interested
what were you thinking while playing
this hand that made you make this
decision
at the moment okay unless you really
have a self-sabotage from another level
you do things because you think it's
correct you're not gonna make the wrong
play on purpose
okay so why did i reacted this way in
this situation
why did it make sense for me at that
time
why did it make sense well that's what i
explained i thought it was an
underbeloved spot
and i thought we had a bluff catcher
okay
step three what is the flaw and why is
it flawed the flaw
is that we were not bluff catching as
villain would sometimes bet a worse hand
for value
this is the main correction to the flaw
this was just something that i missed
now obviously in these hands
particularly you can say yeah okay yeah
you missed that
but let's say for example you suddenly
find out that you do this quite often
and i'm not really surprised at the
mistake
because i've been in this kind of
situation before where i make a big hero
fault and just forget that he can
sometimes have
a worse hand for value so for me this is
actually a recurring mistake
so in my decision making process next
time when i play
i try to have a more top of mind that i
think
okay does my opponent have worse that's
kind of where my decision-making process
should start whereas we could clearly
see on the turn
and wherever i was going in a very
negative
projection of his range
step four what is the correction what
did we miss when did we go wrong
kind of already gave that right we
missed the fact that he could sometimes
though you bet a worse hand step five
why is this correct and what can we
learn from this
this is exactly what i also just said i
went ahead of myself and the steps
what we can learn from this is in the
future keep track of his range a little
bit better what is the bottom of his
value range
and do i beat that do i beat a worse
hand usually in bluff catch scenarios
if he's sometimes better in the same
hand or he's sometimes betting a worse
hand it's very
very rare that you still end up having
to fold
so i think this is uh this is the main
flaw in my thought process in this hand
so this video shows you a little bit of
a different insight i think this is a
very
valuable five steps that jared has
provided the poker world with
in order to fix their mental game
mistakes so if you in the future play
the hand
that you already knew afterwards what's
wrong go through this process i
personally have gained
a way better understanding of certain
mental game leaks that are in my thought
process
and i've done a very good job in my
opinion to correct those
