[00:00]
and i think we have quite an easy hand
to call down with
and i hope he's going to turn over
a 10 8 off suit some of the time
i don't think he's barreling ace king

[00:17]
i don't think he's barreling ace king
so i we should have an
i think we should have a quite a good ev
call here
is jack 7 off suit well that's obviously
also also an option

[00:31]
also also an option

hello hello hello
no introduction
as usual
which is always awkward because i'm
talking to myself and nobody is
listening
flat 3 bet

[01:16]
flat 3 bet
that's what we went for
ok flop
and we face a check race

[01:31]
a hundred percent sure here
can have sevens deuces is unlikely
a block nines
things with a lot of this check raising
range so it will have quite some equity
like two overs or something so it will

[01:46]
like two overs or something so it will
be quite hard to maneuver so maybe we
should have a three betting range here
wouldn't be surprised
if we should
this jamming seems a little bit
optimistic though
but anything smaller also kind of sucks
it's a hard spot

[02:01]
it's a hard spot
i'm gonna go for the call
i wouldn't be surprised if there's
a frequency of something else going on
and now i think it's uh it's one of
these spots
where we have top part top kicker the

[02:15]
where we have top part top kicker the
board is quite drawy
i think it's just time to ship it in and
go to
bed so that's what we're gonna do
and he calls with sevens which is
basically yeah worst case scenario yes

[02:31]
basically yeah worst case scenario yes
sevens then
gg is more interesting let's start with
a 132 bed with three reddit
small blind vs mp
i believe yes

[02:57]
turn
probably a barrel

[03:14]
so that's what we're gonna do

[03:25]
it jams and i think
i'm not too happy about this spot

[03:30]
i'm not too happy about this spot
obviously but i think we have a call
threes is very unlikely fives could be

[03:45]
threes is very unlikely fives could be
nines it's obviously a hand that i'm
very concerned about
but a jack he could have a combo draw
maybe still have queens in this position
actually i'm not really sure about this
one

[04:02]
yeah
okay so he had seven eight suited and he
beamed the river that's quite
unfortunate
it's quite unfortunate
and we don't have auto reload on so we
have two big blinds on the jack eight

[04:17]
have two big blinds on the jack eight
on the button this is a jam for two big
blinds i have no [ __ ] clue
we have zero fold equity
is this a jam
i have no clue
i think it's a fault as we can just

[04:31]
i think it's a fault as we can just
reload let's quickly reload
okay we didn't reload in time but now we
have two big spines and we have king
queen
off that's obviously a race

[04:48]
the reason why i did decide to call in
the end is because six seven suited was
also an open ender seven eight suited
was an open ended we were burying quite
a lot of high cards so i think there's a
good chance that he'll be jamming quite

[05:01]
good chance that he'll be jamming quite
some six seven suited seven eight suited
if he would jam a hand like king queen
uh
oh look at this
look at this guys look at this

[05:15]
look at this guys look at this
how beautiful is that
how beautiful and then we have another
hand
that i wanted to replay that's not
spoiler
choose this hand and as you can see it

[05:30]
choose this hand and as you can see it
yes we can see it
i opened the button
with ace jack
see it at the flop for three quarters
actually i did read the action correctly
right yeah he just defended the big
blind see about three quarters i called

[05:46]
blind see about three quarters i called
and now he
he draw a little donkey donkey so people
are definitely in the dunk streets guys
they're definitely in the dunk street
you [ __ ] dunk you do it again i
remember in a video before i've told you
to not dunk why do you do that why do

[06:03]
to not dunk why do you do that why do
you do that so dumb
i think we have an easy call
now on the river

[06:15]
he goes for an overbet spoiler alert i
called
and basically i'm not really sure if
after three quarters leading a flush
turn is a thing
not sure

[06:31]
but
that being said
yeah basically saying is a flush or
basically saying that he has rivered
something
then i guess that would have to be
queen jack with a with a heart obviously

[06:45]
queen jack with a with a heart obviously
we're blocking that obviously we're also
blocking hearts in general so i guess
that's good
but
to be fair i do think that kind of goes
two ways as we're also blocking bluffs
like jack 9 with the jack of hearts for
example
but then again

[07:01]
but then again
he could also have eight nine with a
nine of hearts
so i decided to call as i also don't you
know we're we're talking about bluff's
value etc i also don't think this is
necessarily the line that he will always
take for value

[07:15]
take for value
and he showed up with a queen 10 with a
heart
which is
quite funky
okay
so definitely we got ourselves a little
funky player here
little funky funky player no on stream
we decided to go for it

[07:31]
we decided to go for it
so yeah and
[Music]
mr mask as he's referring to a session i
did yesterday
for the people who are
not sure yet about joining the academy

[07:45]
not sure yet about joining the academy
i'm giving some or make a little forward
there with the ace queen off
why not why not why not
um
nine seven three
i think i'll start off with a check

[08:05]
as you can definitely have sevens and
nines and i will never have sevens and
and generally when i'm out of position
uh on this low board i'm not gonna do

[08:15]
uh on this low board i'm not gonna do
too much c betting
i like to play a bit more from check
and ace king definitely continuing a
screen kind of depends

[08:33]
now river obviously is interesting
but i think owen is the way to go

[08:49]
and he falls so it was a great play
do you need some help playing three bad
putts out of position well for that we
have created our master classes in which
we dedicate one coaching program to dive

[09:02]
we dedicate one coaching program to dive
very deep into a specific spot go over
to the site pokermission.com
masterclasses and eliminate those
weaknesses

[09:43]
ace jack jack ace ace there's a lot of

[09:47]
ace jack jack ace ace there's a lot of
cards on the table

[10:11]
the five six suited [ __ ] five six
suited i'm opening man five six suited
five for suited those are my hands

[10:17]
five for suited those are my hands
now can someone tell me why would i
race five six suited five four suited
and not six seven seven eight and eight
nine
can someone tell me this i'm curious

[10:31]
can someone tell me this i'm curious
curious for the answer
the person who gives me the correct
answer
the first one

[10:45]
can do a little spin on the wheel at the
end of the stream
by the way if you already want something
on the wheel you're not allowed to
participate let's give people a shot
also who haven't won anything at the
wheel yet

[11:01]
wheel yet
and this is how we do it guys we just
make a straight not gonna lead i don't
think the five is necessarily that good
for me
i think
you could definitely have pocket fives
and i'm way more weighted towards asus
kings these kind of hands and i think he

[11:15]
kings these kind of hands and i think he
will continue betting sets anyway so i
think we will be losing a lot of value
this guy has been doing a lot of betting
so
let's let him do the betting

[11:30]
interesting river
i do actually think this is a river he's
now probably checking back a set on i
would say no he's not gonna check back a
set this guy can have random king queen
so i'm not gonna lead

[11:48]
i knights out some way more likely to
see that
checks back a straight
[ __ ] okay and i should probably lead the
river
[Music]

[12:00]
[Music]
actually [ __ ] why did i bet i don't
think this is a bet
you check raises okay
in hindsight i wanted to check

[12:16]
obviously now we're calling

[12:40]
yeah i didn't want to bet in the first
place and now we get in this situation

[12:45]
place and now we get in this situation
it's always
a not so happy spot to be in
i guess he could sometimes have the best
hand he could sometimes try to bluff me
this guy's been quite aggressive

[13:02]
this guy's been quite aggressive
but not for big sizes though he always
used smaller sizings
i think he's just trying to tell you
tommy
how much radical aces race queen will
make a little over bet

[13:18]
this hand can probably go too
maybe not for for
i
think for this sizing it probably can

[13:33]
i don't think king queen is following
the turn yet for the sizing so then i
think
i would almost prefer
this hand over ace 10.

[13:45]
moving on the river though becomes a
little bit thin
especially with the seven eight
completing
ah it does have ace ten
it's very unlucky we call it three with

[14:00]
it's very unlucky we call it three with
here with the a7 called a flop bet
there's a turn barrel i think we have
quite an easy call
again do we ever want to race i don't

[14:17]
again do we ever want to race i don't
think so
and i think we have quite an easy hand
to call down with

[14:31]
and i hope he's going to turn over
a 10 8 off suit some of the time
i don't think he's barreling ace king
so i we should have an

[14:45]
so i we should have an
i think we should have a quite a good ev
call here
is jack 7 off suit well that's obviously
also also an option
not the 10 8 but it was just the the
yolo the yolo we needed we needed one we

[15:02]
yolo the yolo we needed we needed one we
needed one give it to me baby
give me [ __ ] what the [ __ ]
we had the guy dominated all the way
all the way decided to go for a little

[15:16]
all the way decided to go for a little
flacco here in the button the next tip i
want to tell you about is what i
consider to be my strongest weapon in no
limit texas holder
it's called the flat call so i basically
will flat call with just about anything
before the flop

[15:30]
before the flop
so my boy raises pre-flop i see two
kings
back flat there went for a little check
raise with the 6 7
and we turn a flush
i'm going to go for the check

[15:51]
given how aggressive this guy has been
i'm going to try to go for the check
race

[16:00]
luckily that's then no that always looks
pretty yeah if it works it looks good it
doesn't work you're like
so dumb wacko so dumb
[Music]
why so dumb

[16:20]
