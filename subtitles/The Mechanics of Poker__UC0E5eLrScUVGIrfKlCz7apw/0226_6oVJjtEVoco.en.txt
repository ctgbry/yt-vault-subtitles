if they have a strong but vulnerable
hand they'll almost always check raise
on the flap if they have a nutted hand
they almost always check raise on the
turn and if they get
there they just donk on the River today
we will be chatting with high life Pro
turned YouTube sensation Mark goon Mark
goon used to be an artist singer/
songwriter and he moved to LA to pursue
a career in music I uh I'm an Artist At
Heart my background is music and I I
like the de I like the 300 400 big
blinds deep I like playing in the jungle
however he spended way more time in the
casinos than in the songwriting booth
and he turned live pro worked his way up
to the highest Stakes within 3 years
Mark currently spends his time coaching
and making content on YouTube in which
he Vlogs for a challenge many say is
impossible in which he's trying to earn
$100 an hour playing five5 life if a rag
sat down in my game and didn't know me
wasn't familiar with the content or
anything I would guess that they would
probably think I was a fish for at least
several hours what what what goes on in
your hat that you check rais the turn
there like I I cannot understand I I
tried I honestly tried like why would
you do that that's why like I just roll
my eyes when people are like well people
don't fold at low stakes and it's like
yeah they don't fold when they have the
nuts but they just always tell you when
they have the nuts and if they are
announcing with like a big flashing sign
like I do not have any strong hands well
that kind of opens up the door for some
pretty cool exploits on Rivers exactly
online I look at it is how can I play a
good strategy what is my range how can I
play a sound fundamental strategy in a
spot live I look at it what do my two
cards want to do against this particular
player very very different way of
thinking I've enjoyed this conversation
though this is I think the first time
I've ever had a three and a half hour
conversation where I was like yes more
it's good

Ado guys enjoy this episode Mark uh
let's not mess around I want to jump
straight into the juice
you are uh not afraid to make bold
statements I saw on your YouTube channel
there was a video titled there are no
good players in live poker and also in
our questionnaire you mentioned that you
think 99% of Poker Pros misapply Theory
okay these are these are bold statements
let's start with why or what makes Live
players
bad h
live is easy it's really easy to just
like make like if you're just like if
you just like check the box it's like I
am not an idiot I can tie my shoes you
can make money playing live poker so I
think because the bar is so low well
let's look at online right online you
have to work pretty hard to be a
successful player at least at like
Stakes of like 1K or 2K NL right to like
beat those Stakes you have to you have
to be studying you have to constantly be
evolving adapting and actually putting
in real work whereas live poker if you
just show up and watch a movie on your
iPad and just tune in and catch the
occasional punt like you can make decent
money still playing live poker so I
think because the bar is so low it also
like it lowers the work ethic it lowers
the standard a little bit and I think
because people don't really understand
and what the ceiling is of what you can
make live if you actually work really
really
hard that the standard for being a pro
live is so much lower than this the
standard for being a pro online so you
would say players are too comfortable
because it's too easy that's kind of
what you're referring
to yeah comfortable lazy I know I I I'm
I was the most lazy poker pro at least
for the first part of my career and I I
just yeah I think it's I think it's much
easier than online
then why are players so bad if it's so
easy well they're bad relative to I
would say skilled players online I don't
think they're bad relative to the pool
they're playing against and I guess bad
compared to the potential you see in for
example an hourly that you could reach
given how soft the games are so compared
to your standards of how good people and
how easy it could be you think everyone
is bad
yes yes I think that's fair okay that uh
that actually makes makes a lot of sense
what about like I think you already
mentioned a bit online players are they
are they good or is it something about
poker itself is is the game of poker
just
hard yeah I do I mean I do think poker's
hard I because I used to have this
opinion that like I could teach my
grandmother to make $50 an hour playing
live poker and I I don't believe I
believe the opposite of that now after
working with like a ton of players like
I just don't think that is true I think
I was underrating some of the skill sets
necessary to be successful playing poker
but I I do think like I do think poker
is is relatively hard to be to be great
at it which skill set uh did your
grandma Miss to become a good at poker
being a sociopath being a sociopath so
that's that's the checkbox so what does
a sociopath have in that makes him
better at poker than I think I think let
me take that back I think the skills
necessary are number one and number two
are work ethic and and lack of
ego and I think if you can have those
two things you are well on the path to
becoming a decent poker player as long
as there is like some baseline level of
like logic and ability to use like
rationale because
one of the things I've noticed is like
working with so many players is that
intelligence or natural innate skill
doesn't necessarily mean someone's going
to become a great poker player and
that's one of the things that surprised
me the most over the years the biggest
thing has been are they willing to admit
hey I don't know what I don't know and
throw some stuff out the window and take
in new information and adapt and are
they willing to work their ass off CU I
think if you have those two things like
those are the two main ingredients I've
seen where people can become super
successful in poker So when you say ego
it's sort of uh being open to being
wrong and being open for new ideas
exactly yeah I I think I'm always wrong
I'm constantly wrong in poker I'm
surprised by how wrong I am all of the
time but I'm just willing to say oh it's
not what I thought was I'm a dummy let
me go back and look at this spot let me
go back and rethink this strategy
because I was just I could not have been
further off and I think when people are
open to that when they're willing to
admit that I think that's when things
start clicking and and people who have
this like rigid dogma of this is how
poker's supposed to be played this is
what you're supposed to do this is the
sizing you're supposed to take I think
those are the people who get left
behind the close minded people that
think rigidly like listen this is how
poker should be played and that are they
are not open to the possibilities that
there's other ways out there exactly
yeah do you think due to the competitive
nature of online poker people are a bit
more forced to think like
that no I just think it's safer it's
much it's because no one likes
to be wrong and no one likes to St step
out onto a ledge and fall off a cliff
and it's much easier I kind of think of
Poker like a dance whereas trying
attempting to play a equilibrium
strategy is like I'm going to sit in
this chair right here and I'm never
going to go out on the dance floor
because if I go out on the Dance Floor
there's a chance that I look like a big
idiot but if I sit in this chair and
just play GTO at
equilibrium I can never look like an
idiot and I can just let other people
look like an idiot but if you're willing
to go out on the dance floor and you can
just stay one step ahead of the person
in front of you you can win so much more
money it's uh it's definitely a a
two-sided sword because you can also you
know slip have a drink too much and fall
flaing her face exactly yeah which is a
scary part which is why I think so many
people want to play defense instead of
offense and what do you think is the
biggest um limitation that the being
stuck in defense puts up a player that
cost them a lot of
money two things I think number one is
fear and I talk about this a lot I think
fear and greed Drive 99% of the
decisions especially in live poker and
number two it's this which goes hand
inhand with fear it's just not being
confident enough to trust yourself and
or
being having this projection that like
if I am wrong then I am a bad poker
player or even worse if I am wrong then
I am a bad person and I think a lot of
people get so wrapped up in the if I
make a bad decision then I am bad that
it becomes easier just not to make to
have to put yourself in that position to
make that difficult decision at
all which is under sort of the
assumptions L delusion that just staying
staying to or trying trying to stay to
equilibrium is not a
mistake yeah where I think
like online it's way way way less of a
mistake than live particularly like if
you're playing 1kl and you're playing
against four very good rags and one
wreck well if you're just making
wild exploits when you're in a three-way
pot with a wreck and a ray you're going
to get the pants exploited off like
you're going to lose money right but
then I look at it like live and one of
the best examples I like to give is like
old school live at the bike when it was
like Garrett in art and like six
recreational players and art was winning
a ton of money off of Garrett but
Garrett was winning more money than art
mhm because he was willing to make much
Wilder deviations against the
recreational players and open himself up
to Art to being counter exploited but he
didn't care because he was making so
much more money off the Rex that he was
okay giving a little bit back to Art
yeah that that that makes a lot of sense
you mentioned that in order to go out on
the Dance Floor you you need to you you
need to have a certain level of
confidence right and you need to be okay
with sometimes falling flat on your face
right the way you said it well okay
apparently I was wrong I would just
recalibrate
something that I personally have
struggled with if I do play live and i'
if I put myself in a live player shoes I
think it's very difficult is dealing
with the uncertainty of the game like
in like the certainty that you know
what's going on for example in online
poker we have data you get data on your
own game you analyze your own data you
analyze population data so in terms of
knowing what's going on you can have a
pretty pretty pretty solid idea and
that's backed up with evidence whereas
live you see a
showdown and people make draw quite
quick conclusions over a couple
showdowns whereas an online player would
say well I minimum need you know [ __ ]
500 samples on this stat for it to be
significant and for me to alter my
decisions where life I feel like you
don't have that sample size so how do
you deal with having to make especially
when you're an exploitive player right
when you're exploitive player you need
evidence you need data that something is
right because if you do something on an
assumption and your assumption is wrong
that actually player is going to cost
you a lot of money how do you how do you
deal with that because online the
deviations that players are making
they're like well you know maybe this
combo That was supposed to be bluffed
76% of the time just they end up just
giving up with that combo combo pure so
you're going to need a sample of 500
hands a thousand hands to be able to see
that live it's big Jeremy in seat 8 just
bets pot whenever he has a strong hand
on a vulnerable board and Bets one-third
pot whenever he has an under pair or
second pair or a draw so like the things
people are doing live are so face up and
so much more transparent than the
deviations people are making online that
you are able to draw inferences so much
quicker because the things they're doing
are just very very
apparent there's a less there's less
noise what you see that is just what you
get and also I guess you know you're I
think it's also different right you're
playing one table you're focused on
specifically this guy at Cate and you're
looking at his bad sizing patterns right
you're figuring out whereas online
especially if we talk about just average
population Tendencies you will need
bigger samples to filter out the noise
because within that big sample you know
big Jeremy is also in there you know
potting with value but you know we also
have someone else potting with Bluff so
then to get the average we need a bigger
number online you're like you said
you're trying to play against the pool
and live you're trying to play against
Big
Jeremy yeah actually that makes a lot of
sense
because due to if you play multiple TBL
let's say for example you know someone
listening plays 100 200 now rush and
cash GG big poo a lot of tables you
don't have the same amount of brain
power to to look at one individual
player how is playing so you're a bit
also more forced to think about your
strategy as a whole that you're
executing right because you're putting
in I don't know how many hundreds hands
of per hour whereas online given the
fact that you know you have more time to
think about one hand and you have time
to study Big Jeremy it pays off more to
play the player instead of your strategy
EX exactly online I look at it is how
can I play a good strategy what is my
range how can I play a sound fundamental
strategy in a spot live I look at it
what do my two cards want to do against
this particular
player very very different way of
thinking how do you you already
explained a little bit you know that you
need less sample especially the worse
the player the more transparent this
action and the more we can predict it in
the future how do you deal with
bias uh in in live poker where you know
you you work with smaller
samples my opinion is like I like I said
I'm wrong a lot I'm wrong all the time
but you just have to be right more than
you're wrong and my opinion is
that it is more profitable to
assume that everybody is making similar
mistakes like live and then adjust back
from there if you see somebody is solid
then to assume that they are a good
player and play defense so I just start
off balls to the wall foot on the gas I
am playing full exploit offense and if
this guy shows me that he deserves
respect then I'll pull it back and go to
a more Baseline strategy but until then
I'm just assuming everybody is wide open
for
exploits yeah I'm watching a little bit
of your content you know in preparation
not only preparation for this
like I already saw some Rec before but
in preparation for the podcast watch a
little bit more and I do have to say you
know the five five live games yeah they
don't really seen that GTO so I uh not
at all like I saw some plays there like
how like I think there was one hand
where you where you went very out of
line with the 89 offsuit for batting and
it was against I think it was the better
player at the table and he check raced
you with the a sking not flush I was
like what what what goes on in your hats
that you check race the turn there like
I I cannot understand I I tried I
honestly tried like why would you do
that even you have the king so it's way
less likely that you have a yeah yeah I
mean yeah if that kind of [ __ ] happens
you know yeah then obviously you should
definitely not yeah you should
definitely alter your strategy uh yeah
BEC because I mean that that those are
the good the the solid players at the
table are doing that they're still
letting you off the hook they always let
you off the hook and I actually have a
video coming out very soon talking about
let how recreational players in general
just let you off the hook and they let
you off the hook in three ways they let
you off the hook because when they have
a strong hand they will just check raise
on the Flop and if they hit a strong
hand if they have if they have a strong
but vulnerable hand they'll almost
always check raise on the Flop if they
have a nutted hand they almost always
check raise on the turn and if they get
there they just donk on the river so
what that means is if they don't do one
of those three things they're just
insanely capped getting to the river and
that's why like I just roll my eyes when
people are like well people don't fold
at low stakes and it's like yeah they
don't fold when they have the nuts but
they just always tell you when they have
the nuts and if they are announcing with
like a big flashing sign like I do not
have any strong hands well that kind of
opens up the door for some pretty cool
exploits on
Rivers yeah I was gonna say how does
this maybe a bit of a broad question but
maybe some examples can come to your
mind how does the fact that people give
away so much
information how does that alter your
strategies it just allows you to get
closer and closer to the edge of that
exploit cliff and just keep pushing and
it allows you to take
ridiculously huge sizes for thin value
when you know that this guy doesn't like
folding and it allows you to just Bluff
with absolutely zero Equity across three
streets putting in a ton of money which
when you know that are players insanely
capped so you're just able to get so
insanely out of line it's almost like
your two cards don't really matter a
whole lot it's much more
about what they are doing than anything
you are doing and I think that's one of
the key things I've learned about live
poker is like everybody likes to be the
hero in the story but if you just
consider that the other person is the
hero consider what has happened to them
are they up are they down have they been
blocked how are they feeling are they
sitting deep have they been running good
and they're on lockup mode like if you
just think about these things instead of
what is my image what do they think of
no one gives a crap no one cares about
me no one cares about you they care
about themselves and if you think about
like what's going on in their head you
can just play wildly profitable exploit
poker how do you I mean you develop that
skill sort of like predict what's going
to happen right kind of having a a for
the game like okay this guy is now fed
up or you know kind of what what is
happening by observing what's happening
to this guy how do you then because you
also do a lot of coaching how how do you
teach a skill like that because I feel
like it's very intuitive whereas for
example you can teach an online kid
comes you know you analyze his data you
give him a strategy it's it's for me
it's way more abstract to no it's less
abstract to teach whereas something like
this is like yeah you know you need to
kind of feel where where Big Jeremy is
at you know Big Jeremy is about to
exploit H how how do how would you teach
something like that out of Cur I think
winning the most amount of money at live
poker is just having a systematic list
of questions that you ask yourself
throughout every decision point in the
hand and if you can come up with what we
call like a repeatable thought process
where you're asking a good set of
questions on every street that are valid
for that line that has happened in that
line if you can ask the questions you
can come to the right answer and it's
just remembering to ask yourself and and
practicing asking yourself the right
questions over and over and over again
on every flop turn in
river we have an example of uh what is a
very common bad question people ask and
what would be a better question for
people to ask so I think like a bad
question would be like what size do I
need to bet to protect my hand like
worried about a draw coming in worried
about a flush coming in like that's a
bad that's thinking from like a
fear-based mindset better questions
would be is my opponent
capped if they are capped well what's
the biggest size that they're going to
call with top pair or their nut flesh
draws or their straight draws right and
if they are capped like we kind of want
them to call on the turn with all of
those hands both with our value and our
Bluffs because on the river if we're 250
big Blends deep in live poker they're
folding everything unless they make two
pair or they're flush right so are they
capped and if yes well then we choose
the big size or are they capped and the
answer is no well what size can I bet
where they will Fast play all of their
strong hands and call with their weak
hands and again that's a question I like
to ask with both Bluffs and value
because if I have the nut
flush and I bet small and that entices
them to raise off all their smaller
flushes that's pretty good for the nut
flush and if I bet small when I have a
bluff and they raise off all their
flushes that's also pretty good when
we're bluffing because now we can just
Bluff with impunity on the river so
those would be some questions I would
ask possibly like on turns and then the
river my favorite one is what would I do
with the inverse and this one confuses
people but it's essentially just when I
have a value hand I ask to keep myself
logically consistent because I hear this
so often right I hear this so often
people say on the river you know they
have a value hand and they're like I'm
not going to go all in because I think
this guy will fold toir and then they
get to the river with eight high and
they say I'm not going to go all in
because I think this guy's going to call
with top pair well both of those things
can't be true right they can't be true
it's just not possible so like in every
hand like I always tell people to ask
like when I have value ask what size
would I bet with a bluff and it helps
for me it helps hold me accountable and
keep me logically consistent because I
know when I have a value hand and I
think well if I was bluffing here I
probably wouldn't want to go all in
because I think this guy would just call
with top pair oh so now I I have a value
hand so let's Jam because I don't think
he's folding top pair and I do the
opposite when I have a bluff so like
that question is like one of my
favorites on Rivers because it helps
hold me
accountable poker is a very easy game
when you're at in a river situation and
you know that if you go in this guy
always call stop air or if you go in he
always full stop air then the answer is
easy how do you learn to know if someone
always FS stop
like again we kind of come back to let's
say for example situation is opponent's
capped you go you therefore you're over
bluffing uh right and that size is very
Bluff heavy um your opponent calls with
a hand to F you was going to fault do
you then radically switch your strategy
and do the inverse of the inverse or is
that one one occasion not
enough for me the sample size of one is
plenty um but as far as like Cal
calibration is really really tough it's
one of the hardest things and I think
like a skill of super valuable skills of
poker players is like being able to
adjust on the Fly really quickly as far
as like calibrating on Rivers one of the
things that helps me the most is for
most like for 90 plus per of
recreational players absolute Size
Matters a 100 times more than relative
size and what I mean by that is if
you're playing five5 and the game is a
thousand buying and a guy's sitting
there with
$1,700
right a $1,200 bet on the river it
doesn't matter if the pot is 17,600
because it was already multi-way and
it's three4 pot a $1,200 bet on the
river is huge and most players Live
players are risk averse they don't want
to make a bad decision they don't want
to punt off their stack and have a bad
decision that's going to ruin their day
so I think taking into account like
absolute size over relative size like
even if you bet 3x pot well if it checks
all the way to the river and you bet 150
into 50 they may still call with second
pair because it's
$150 but like in a four bet pot if
you're betting 900 or 1,200 on the river
it may only be a third of the pot but
it's still a huge bet so I think like
that's how I've you know that's how I
found the best success with calibrating
is absolute versus relative
you are I mean this very rhetorical
question I was going to
ask wait let let me let me see if I can
I I can I can reframe the session let's
[Music]
say I kind of already know what you got
to answer because I was gonna ask like
the first question that came up in mind
aren't you concerned because if I hear
that it's basically your sizing based on
my perceived range so when my perceived
range weak capped big means uh you're
big bad means that you're weak and your
small bed means that you're strong if I
know that that's the bad sizing
philosophy that you use I can play
perfect and then your strategy suddenly
loses a lot of money right it's kind of
what what we talked about earlier the
two-sided sword of EX of exploit but you
know you're you're you're obvious as is
going to be no and correct me if I'm
wrong correct you're not concerned about
that uh and then I zero well what if
you're against a good player but then we
come back to there there's no good
players well if they were a good player
they wouldn't be playing five5 live okay
so let's say you know you do play in a
tougher game What's the what's what's
the backup plan you you you you kind of
you kind of go into this mind world
where like he knows that I know so I now
do the inverse of the
inverse yeah so I I mean I'm not going
to just like go out on like the edge of
the cliff here against players I
perceive to be like solid Rags like
solid winning players like I still I'm
still going to ex try to exploit the r
pool but it's going to be a much softer
style exploit than just like oh this
guy's range is capped so I Bluff big
like that is how I'm playing against
like yeah 99% of the pool at 55 now if
I'm playing in like a 1020 or 2040
public game I'm probably not thinking
that way when playing against like the
strong Pros because that's how you just
get eaten alive but I would say this
works against all wreck players live and
that's let's be honest like that's where
90 plus percent of the money is going to
come from if you are a live player your
money's coming from the recreational
players and so many players are focused
on I want to rag battle I want to be
good against Rags which is great that's
a great skill to have if you're playing
online where you're playing six Maxs
where maybe one player at the table is a
wreck or a lot of times it's just like
maybe like two weaker rags and that's
the softer players at the table so like
you have to be whoever is going to be
able to play execute a baseline strategy
better and make some soft exploits is
going to win the most amount of money
but live when you're playing at a table
with three pros or four pros and five
Rex right whoever exploits the crap out
of the Rex the most is the person who's
going to win the most amount of money so
since my background is mostly live
that's what I'm mostly concerned about
when playing live poker yeah from the
sounds of it it seems like too many
players at non tough 10 20 40 games are
thinking like they are at a 10 20 40
games and give way too much credit on
their opponent and they're trying to
play this solid strategy where the
environment is not optimal or at least
it doesn't encourage to play a strategy
like that does that kind sound right
exactly 100% And and I would say
like even still like most of the players
who are like trying to play a solid
strategy like if you
just their solid strategy is like if
this happens and this happens then I do
this right if there is a 3.4x three bet
in position and he see bets oneir on the
Flop I know how to respond with my range
in this well what if he over bets on
what if he plays an overb or check
strategy on the Flop which doesn't lose
a ton of EV versus just range betting
1/3 all of a sudden like you've just
taken that Rag and thrown them into the
jungle and now sudden they have to play
with lions and tigers and they have
absolutely no idea what's going on
because all they've studied is one third
part so that's like that's going off on
a tangent a little bit but that's that's
some of the way I like to um throw a
wrench in rags game plans is by throwing
them into strategies that I have studied
that they may not have looked at yeah
and this especially works at like kind
of the GTO memorization type right that
kind of tried to memorize everything but
that doesn't really know the mechanics
behind the game and how to
how to problem solve on the Fly do you
think also that for example I remember I
saw a video of VI thought was very very
nicely done where uh you had I think a
couple of Pros on and they had to do a
347 flop if I'm not mistaken do you and
you know the conclusion was these are
very good winning players and they all
suck that was I think that was that was
the everyone's bad at life very nicely
done uh definitely recommend people to
go check it out um but what I was trying
to say do you think that because online
in G life is a bit more chaotic you have
a more a lot more variety of spots
whereas online the same spot just
happens more frequently right as waymore
just had some pots for example I
actually I actually quick quickly
checked up some data and I see online if
you look at at least frequency wise the
spot is even at like 200l it's play
pretty [ __ ] well like frequency wise
they they're they're they're not off you
know you think also therefore online
also with the tools to analyze your game
compared to GTO and the fact that you
just people drill these spots the spots
are reoccurring it's easier in terms of
frequency of the spots so therefore it's
easier to play quotequote GTO and a bit
more robotic than for example life poker
where problem solving on the Fly Just
serves you way better yeah I think so I
say I think a h 100 big blind poker is
science it's mechanical 300 big blind
poker is art
[Music]
H so there picoso wins and uh and online
poker I don't know I don't know who that
wins lius but to be fair lius would
probably also win in three on the big
black poker um yeah true he he can do
both you let's talk a little about the
we talk a lot about exploitation I want
to talk a little bit about Theory to
something else that you said right you
said 99 of Pros Miss Supply poker Theory
now I want to actually clear one thing
up when we talk po when you say poker
Theory are we talking
about GTO strategy so when you look at
the solver you see a GTO strategy or are
we talking about theoretical Concepts
that we see a GTO strategy applying both
all of the above of the above so people
suck at implementing a GTO strategy
which you know I I I I obviously
everyone knows you know you cannot
really apply a GTO strategy you can only
make an attempt um but just they also
say that 99% of players suck at
understanding the theoretical principles
on which the GTO strategy is built
correct okay uh is it then also before
node locking or after after no locking
when we talk about Theory so Theory
applied in for example the live
environment is you take Theory you then
not lock it and out of that comes the
optimal strategy for the situation that
we in in order to come to that
conclusion you need to understand Theory
to a certain degree or we're talking
just fundamental Theory Concepts people
just don't understand the latter
fundamental Theory Concepts people don't
understand because I think most people
don't
even get into the nod loocking
streets what is uh an example of a clear
theoretical concept that people just
misapply and it's costing a lot of
money equilibrium is a delicate balance
it's like a seesaw and if you have two
equal weight people sitting on the
Seesaw well then you're GTO in
equilibrium but if on the other end of
the Seesaw is a squirrel and you are 300
lb well now all of a sudden equilibrium
is out of balance so for example I
played a hand
where
a
wreck opened I three bet and the Flop
came
567 2tone
and the wreck checked to me and in a
three bet pot I just potted it on the
Flop and we ended up getting the money
in I had the nuts I had 89 and a rag
leans over and Whispers to me he said
you must really be studying because I
know that spot is pot or check and I
just nod and yep and in my head I'm
thinking this guy just isn't folding any
hands on this board so I just potted it
because
why like I'm thinking of the nod locked
Theory and he's thinking of theory and
equilibrium which doesn't apply because
that seesaw like we talked about is just
one end as a squirrel and one end is a
300 PB guy so I think people are so
often confused and just like well let's
apply Theory at equilibrium where
equilibrium just isn't really
happening that makes a lot of sense so
this comes a bit more I would say to
like understanding GTO really under
understanding equilibrium maybe I can
maybe I can give an example of what I
would
say that is poker Theory misapplied
let's say for example I think this is
probably the most common mistake that I
always
see when when boards become
draw people often have the opposite of
the theoretical correct response which
is they are afraid and they start to
quotequote protect their hand but that
all they do is isolate themselves versus
High Equity Holdings and guess what
flush came in guess what he had the
flush yeah obviously you where you pump
so much money in an earlier Street at
some point what's left is the nuts and
you're always beat you know that's a
clear like I don't care if you apply an
aega strategy or exploitive strategy
that's a theoretical concept of like
okay we're deep board is draw Equity
retention is not great so let's not p a
lot of money in right now right I think
a very fundamental poker theoretical
concept that especially in live poker R
play very deep should always be applied
but people constantly misapply even like
I played I have very little experienced
life poker but sometimes you know I go
to Vegas play at the win 10 20 40
considered a very tough game and even
there I see Rex misapply like a
fundamental poker theoretical concept of
like what are you doing I don't care if
it's exploit GTO this is just wrong I
you understand what I mean
mhm yeah I see it all the time even like
rag versus rag pots and like you you
said something interesting because I see
that all the time on the draw boards
it's just like people start going merged
on the turn like betting pocket jacks on
like Queen 8642 tone like because
there's a flush draw on a bunch of
straight draws out there for a large
size they're just like over betting with
pocket jacks or something it's like why
because they're scared because fear it's
fear of I have to protect my
hand yeah and when and when when a board
is uh Queen D do three rainbow they're
like oh I'll check it well is this
actually the spot where you should
probably invest some money in your hand
because you know it's good and it's
likely to remain good you know uh so
that's for example to to get kind of
back to my question that's an example of
Poker
Theory uh that regardless if you play
exploited poker GTO strategies blah blah
blah that's a theory concept that you
should always take in consideration uh
now is there for you for example you're
clearly more explosive approach what do
you think is one of these theoretical
Concepts that you still take highly in
consideration obviously you're not going
to play a GTO strategy right you're not
worried about equilibrium but are you
worried what are kind of like some
underlying mechanics of the game
underlying poker theoretical Concepts
that even though you apply a lot of uh
exploitability in your strategy you
still take taking
consideration to be honest when I'm
playing live not many I'm uh I'm if if
if if a rag sat down in my game and
didn't know me wasn't familiar with the
content or anything I would guess that
they would probably think I was a fish
for at least several
hours this is good good sign right
yeah yeah I mean I'm not really taking
into account many theoretical Concepts
when playing live at all and I did
mostly during Co play online and I found
that to be a a fun challenge I mostly
played um I streamed a lot I played I
started at 500 in NL and moved up and
played 1knl and was streaming 1knl
um three times a week and I found that
to be a fun challenge but I found it to
be like I said a little bit
mechanical and I did enjoy diving in and
learning the
theory but I uh I'm an artist at heart
my background is music and I I like the
de I like the 300 400 big blinds deep I
like playing in the jungle when you then
came back from your online experience
what were like some things that you
learned through your online experience
that you were like hey this going to
apply life or due to getting a better
understanding of theory and how the game
quote quote should be played in this you
know uh mechanic world uh what are kind
of some knowledge that you took with you
then afterwards to the live round that
you were like hey I got some new tricks
up my sleep a couple things I learned
better how to study especially against
Rags so I think how a lot of people
study and how I used to study was I
would look at a spot and I have Ace
queen with the Queen of Clubs am I
supposed to Bluff in this spot yes or no
well the solver says 55% of the time so
whatever I did fine whereas like after
playing online I would look at a spot
and see oh this guy's supposed to Bluff
here with
108 100% of the time and he gave up on
the river what does that mean well it
means a couple things it means number
one that when he bets on the river that
he is under bluffing so since he is
under bluffing on this River now every
Bluff catcher that I have is not a
profitable call in this spot if I'm sure
this guy's under bluffing this
particular spot so I translated that to
live and started looking at spots where
hey are rags in this spot under bluffing
or over bluffing this spot are they over
calling or over folding in this spot and
I started looking at different textures
different configurations and started
figuring out where RS under Bluff where
they overall where they over fold Etc
that's one of the biggest things I took
from online to live the second thing I
think is using like data like using like
hand to note a lot of like population
tendencies that I actually realized from
Rex for example like how to play against
donk bets much better how to funnel Rex
to lines where they massively over Bluff
which was something I was not
comfortable with live before so yeah I
mean th those are I took a lot of things
actually away from online that improved
my live game how have you found the data
translating from uh on poker to life
poker I remember I think it was Matt
berki and Nick Howard they were always
having little argument about that Nick
says you know that the data applies in
life and then bery say yeah sure you
hero call you know Big Jeremy Cate you
know go go go follow the data and bery
basically said that Nick was crazy what
was your experience in terms of you know
looking at data online and how that
translated to life I think a lot of it
has applied in my experience especially
because like
we purchased like samples of hundreds of
millions of hands of fish who were
playing like 50 NL and 100 NL and kind
of looked at started looking at like
well what do they have when they dunk or
what do they have when they call a small
seab bet turn goes check check and they
bet half pot on the river and like
looking at those types of lines like
figuring like putting things together
like it's translated really really well
to live it's become some of the some
like first things we we teach students
is we stuff we gleaned from like Mass
data from low stakes
online yeah e even even though the the
game itself how it's eventually played
the strategies being executed is
different obviously the mechanics behind
it remain the same and especially the
let's just call it psych this kind of
the psychology behind it so what leads
to a spot being over bluffed online is
kind of the same variable's life you
know a certain spot is just more
sensitive to be over bluffed more
sensitive sensitive to be under bluffed
and if you play Live or online that
doesn't matter do you agree with that
yeah 100% I think one of one of my
favorite examples
is wck players call too much pre flop
right they just call with too many hands
when you see that small on the Flop they
float too wide and also tend to fast
play their strong hands at too high of a
frequency so when they check call The
Flop their range is relatively crippled
and pretty weak and they just have too
many hands in there then when the turn
goes check check okay they arrive at the
same range on the river and then getting
to the river rexs generally split their
range pretty hard on the river and when
they get there with no Showdown value
they're just like half pot 55% pot 60%
pot and when they get there with a
pretty good hand well all of a sudden
greed wins out cuz only one street of
money has gone into the pot and the big
size just comes out 75% 100% over bet
and so like that's one of the ones I
found is translated to live the most is
the seab BET flop checkback turn Bluff
catch river when they bet half pot it's
just it's just a bluff 85% of the time
yeah and even that is still very line
specific if we Zoom even more out and
figure out like okay if they play too
many hands pre flop and under flop it
just naturally means they're going to
get in trouble later streets either by
overfall and over bluffing right so we
kind of understand the reason why that
leak existed and now we can kind of you
know apply this knowledge in other spots
as well and I'm a you know I'm not I'm
not in the the data sheet Camp I think
that's way too robotic you're know oh
you know here's all the data but I'm
obviously I think data is a big part of
the game and you should definitely study
it but I always like to then Zoom it out
and kind of understand like okay this is
the theory this is the data why is the
data like this and in that the things
that you teach the thing the things that
you learn like I said they're very
applicable life as well in The Limited
experience I have but it just makes a
lot of sense 100% And I think like what
you said it's super important like being
able to apply the why from the data
being able to look at a solver output
and applying the why from the solver
output that's the that's the most
important thing you can do I think to to
to get
better and that's actually something
that especially online online players
they struggle with a lot right they are
very much in the what mindset oh what I
have to do what I have to do and they
just completely forget who they play
against I always say in my
decision-making process the first thing
the first thing that you have to
consider is who am I playing against
because that the answer to that question
will steer where your thoughts are
supposed to go if the answer is lonus
then sure you know randomize here be
very blocker specific removal blah blah
blah but if you know Big Jeremy see did
poor poor Big Jeremy uh he's really
getting pounded on this this podcast but
big Jeremy you know if Big Jeremy is in
is in the big blind we should maybe have
a different thought process because what
matters now changes right and I feel
like a lot of like lot of students that
I hear a mistake even on the river and
they say okay let's go back when we
opened the hand and the guy called who
called well you are thinking about a lot
of things on the river that are not
apply applicable to Big Jeremy you know
and that's also where it goes wrong and
to be fair then I see online or the SC
alive you could also then say the same
thing but it's going to occur less
frequent right you could also say well
you forgot to to take in consideration
that you know lonus went went away from
his PC and he said in the big blind so
maybe you should have taken a little bit
of a different approach um and I think
especially online the skill is to to be
good at both to be be good at playing
defense because there's just more
players that you have to play a bit more
defensive against so a solid Bas and
strategy just make makes more sense uh
and then therefore also because of the
environment that's a skill that people
thrive at and they are less good at
exploita and thinking you know thinking
creatively and I think live due to the
environment it's the opposite
right yeah I 100% agree and I think uh I
I think you do you do still see that
defensive mindset that you talk about
from online Rags live quite a bit for
example I'll see like a rag like open 3x
on button when there's a fish in the
small blind and a whale in the big blind
it's like why are we opening 3x like
this guy's not folding A6 offit
like maybe we should just open like 6X
and just open good hands like the yeah
the
uh so many like it just goes back to I
think like fear of making
mistakes you mentioned that the 99% of
misly Theory what sets the 1%
apart
curiosity just a just innate
curiosity and I think a lot of people
just want to scratch an itch did I play
this hand well was I supposed to Bluff
with this combo was I supposed to fold
this hand and instead like you talked
about the zooming out you're never going
to play this hand against this player in
this line at this table ever again so
why not zoom out and try to take a
bigger picture consideration away from
it so you can apply it to the next 100
hands you play in a similar spot like
that to me is players who
want the why why should I not Bluff with
this hand the Curiosity to ask those
type of questions is what separates the
the real cream of the
crop I like that answer curiosity in
general it also comes a little bit back
to what we talked about in the beginning
right that due to the low level of
competition people are just satisfied
with their winnings they're not curious
in terms of wow I'm winning at I don't
know what a normal rate is $100 an hour
at 55 no wait that was that was deemed
impossible so a a little bit lower uh50
$50 you know and they're like this
pretty good they're not like hm let me
let me think what what could I do to
make a $100 an hour you know if they
would ask that question then that opens
that that that can open then your mind
to like well actually maybe what I'm
they they you're going to rethink
everything that you're doing should
already 3x the button here with the will
and and the fish there hm maybe not you
know and it seems like that that's very
much linked into this curiosity that you
mentioned so basically way because you
coach a lot of Life players you open
their minds is that kind of a good a
good summary of mania what's what's
happening yeah it's it's not about
memorizing at all it's not about
memorizing it's about developing a
thought process to ask the right
questions and to become curious enough
yourself in hands where you are asking
the questions that help lead you to a
good answer instead of memorizing some
rigid strategy that you're going to play
against everybody because that's not
going to
help Adam I know you uh you're mainly an
online grinder and life I don't think
there's a lot of heads up turbo sitting
ghost that I know of any any life
experience
no very little live experience apart
from playing with friends which was
definitely a exploit based um game
Dynamic rather than the online streets
yeah really interested in hearing how
you spoke about the live environment
Mark and I've been writing a lot of
different things down which I want to
kind of piece together so you mentioned
like to be successful in live poker you
need to be brave which you and ren were
talking about going on the Dance Floor
being the exploit player being willing
to make mistakes you also mentioned work
ethic being a very strong contribut to
to life success and you mentioned a lack
of ego which I've wrote down as kind of
been open-minded and willing to admit
mistakes and then ear you mentioned like
two big obstacles players face of fear
and greed so I want to kind of piece
together like how to overcome those
obstacles and move towards the kind of
optimal trait so let's say a player is
struggling with fear I think you
mentioned fear making mistakes being a
very big one and a player comes to work
with you while he's trying to improve on
this but he is a bit of a fearful guy he
struggles to uh step on the Dance Floor
get rejected how do we start to uh move
past fear how do players start to
acknowledge the fear is there but start
to build more bravery to actually play a
more exploitive style one of the biggest
things I see with Live players
especially is is risk aversion and
they're just that that basically
manifests Their Fear it's just like I'm
scared that this won't work right this
if I go too big they'll fold with my
value if I go if I Bluff like I'll lose
money and like the best way I can
explain it is if you just if you just
pull up a variance calculator and you
look at a guy who is
winning like live like it would be like
15 bigs an hour so like I don't know how
many bigs that is 40 bigs per 100 or
something like that would be a very
strong live win rate and you give him an
insane standard deviation because he's
just sticking in 300 big lines all the
time right and you zoom out and look at
that over a 200h hour sample and then or
let's say zoom out look at over a 2,000
hour sample so over a year for a
full-time player and then you take a guy
who's just going to play like a very
tight like trying to play Baseline value
oriented strategy live because the
player pool is just calling a little too
much whatever and they're just going to
play more like a knit they're going to
open relatively tight they're just not
going to step out on that dance floor
and say that guy has half the win rate
but he has a third of the variant like
the standard deviation is like a third
and you look at that guy over a 2,000
hour sample well the first guy who has
the insane standard deviation but the
much higher win rate is just literally
never going to lose over 250 hours like
never ever ever going to lose over 250
hours and yes the session to session
results are going to swing wildly week
to week is going to swing wildly over 60
hours it's going to swing wildly but and
then you look at the guy who's a big
winner winning 50 10 10 10 big lines an
hour right and that guy's going to have
400 500 hour samples where he's Break
Even or slightly losing and he's not
going to have as big of session to
session
swings but he's going to have so many
more down swings over a long period
because he's just not winning as much so
the way I like to explain it is if
you're looking at a spot where you
sticking in 300 big blinds is going to
win you $2 in EV that's pretty scary but
if you take every single one of those
spots over the course of a year you're
just literally never going to lose over
250 hours live which like and if I just
if you just keep reinforcing that
concept if you're the biggest winner in
your pool live the edges are so big you
will literally never lose over a
two-month sample if you are playing
full-time and that has kind of resonated
with people a
lot yeah so sounds like instilling the
confidence in these players that the
risks they're taking are going to pay
off over the long term cuz as you
mention mentioned the risk aversion is
coming from the what if what if I lose
what if this doesn't work and you
obiously ins still enough confidence
going look if you just keep doing this
don't worry about the shortterm you're
going to cut the side you will be
successful so how do you transfer that
confidence to the people because it's
one of those things where the problem
with risk is that it might may not work
because if there wasn't if it could
worked every time it wouldn't be a risk
so the mindsets always like well what if
it doesn't work for me whats if Mark is
wrong on this how do you get players to
maybe have a strong aversion to fear or
maybe the playing in a new game that
they haven't played before so they hav
got the confidence in the strategy
anything you do to help them kind of
overcome those
fears we had one player we started as a
stable like a live stable and we had a
guy in Florida and he before he started
with us he was a full-time player and he
was a
self-described tight ABC Pro and he was
winning 30 bucks an hour playing two5
playing full-time and he had the biggest
tough time with like making that leap
with being able to just stick in the
money with air with being able to just
pull the trigger and he just like he
wouldn't he would understand it but he
couldn't actually do it because the fear
would just no this time I'll get him
next time you know I'll I'll pull the
trigger next time this doesn't seem I
have bad blockers it doesn't seem like a
good spot right
so we had a heart-to-heart sit down and
it basically was are you happy with
where you are because you're earning $30
an hour and if you were happy you
wouldn't have come to us you wouldn't
have given up a percentage of your
profits you wouldn't be taking 10 hours
a week of doing coaching sessions and
homework if you were happy with making
$30 an hour for the rest of your life so
if you want to change it's going to be
scary but you're going to have to jump
and if you're not willing to jump there
is nothing I can do there's literally
nothing I can you know what you're
supposed to do if you're not able to do
it we're going to have to in this
relationship because I can't make you
jump I can't push you you got to jump
and it took six months but he went from
25 to 510 to
1020 and he is now earning four times or
five times what he was earning two years
ago when we started and there are some
success stories like that and there are
some players who just understand it and
can't make the jump and just never make
the jump and I still haven't figured
out a sure file Surefire fail prooof way
to get them to make the jump some people
will some people won't I can push but if
they won't jump out of the
plane I can't make
them I love that I like that whole
analogy as well of you can gain them so
far but it comes the point where you get
to the edge and they need to Lear a jump
I like how you did that that you kind of
reverse engineered it back to them and
go right it's up to to you are you happy
do you want to jump like this is your
decision this is what it comes to like
our lives we all play the one player
game at some point and we can have
guidance we have coaches but at some
point you got to pull the trigger you
got to take the jump if you're not
wanting to do it you do the consequences
so yeah I really like the the process
and yeah I I'm also still trying to find
that that secret system to get everyone
to make the jump they need to um once
once we figure that out everyone will
have a amazing life H but I think it's
just dealing with humans we need to uh
understand some people for their own
reasons already what will make that
plunge and just being okay with that as
long as you've guided them as far as you
can all right I want to go into the next
kind of topic here which is you
mentioned a lack of ego which is a great
place to be open-minded we all can
relate to uh people who have success in
life in general are very open don't get
to attach the ideas willing to change
their opinions based on your information
but we also BM to a lot of poker players
who are very stubborn have a very big
ego and they struggle with this so how
do we start to get into this curiosity
which you mentioned the 1% he when
people are a bit close-minded I'm sure
in your community where players you spot
this guy's bit an ego this guy's little
bit tash's opinion how do we start to
dissolve that ego to allow players to be
more open-minded on day one we learned
this the hard way because guys were just
this stuff seems okay I don't know if
this will on day
one we have them play against the solver
in a spot where there's like an awkward
stack size they haven't been able to
look at and so like we just have them
play against a solver against a we frame
it as you're playing against the world's
greatest
player try to play
equilibrium and without fail the solver
just exploits the crap out of them in
every single note like we have them play
two notes against a against a check on
the flop in a three bet pot they're in
position against a check on the Flop and
against a bed on the Flop and without
fail they're
losing three four five big blinds from
literally two decisions every month and
that has been like just holding up not
not telling people but just literally
holding up the mirror and saying here's
how the solvers exploiting you you're
somebody who just spent a bunch of money
and is investing a ton of time into
learning how to be a winning poker
player and you're already winning you're
already winning a 25 or 510 or whatever
it
is and if the solver is exploiting you
this
hard how hard do you think you can
exploit the players in your game who are
not investing time who are not investing
money in poker and for for us I think
just like just holding up that mirror
has been super successful to getting
people to drop the preconceived notions
at the door that like I know what I'm
doing I have all the
answers it's like a slop in the face
with with reality and going hey you know
as good as you think you are wake up and
yeah I really like that cuz you're
trying to open up the doorway to
curiosity that's what kind of lack in
the ego is it's like Drop it like just
open up the door to new Solutions new
ideas and I really like to kind of meet
in meetting them with with reality and
go right look this is poker the highest
levels how good do you fair up and then
yeah they can then sa themselves wait a
second there's things I don't know
awesome what else don't I know don't
know doorways that opens we're on the
Curiosity train let's go Full Speed
Ahead all right next one you mentioned
was work ethic we're going to come back
into this from different angles but for
you in terms of work ethic what do you
think is needed in the modern world of
Poker to have success how does work
ethic how do you kind of Define
that I find this harder for people to
hold themsel accountable if they don't
have somebody to tell them what to
do and a lot of people get into poker
because they want to be their own boss
without
realizing sometimes it's harder to Be
Your Own Boss than having a boss and if
you're not willing to like for myself
like I was a full-time artist I was a
songwriter and I did not really hold
myself accountable because it would I
would wake up and be like you know what
my voice isn't warmed up I'm not going
to go in the booth yet let's wait an
hour you know what I'm not really
feeling inspired today let's go on a
walk let's go smoke a joint let's go on
a walk let's find some inspiration um
you know what like I don't know maybe
I'll just I'll go to the gym right now
because I'm not feeling like I and like
if you it's very easy as your own boss
to do that
and I hear a huge gap often with poker
players between
what the goal is and what they're
actually doing and I think one of the
biggest things is being able to like set
realistic goals and I hear so many poker
players say I want to be the best well
really you want to be the best like
that's not my goal and like I'm working
80 hours a week right like if I wanted
to be the best poker player in the world
like think about like think about what
LeBron James is doing to be the best
basketball player like it's the same
type of [ __ ] he's spending $1.5 million
dollars a year on his body he sleeps 12
hours a day he wakes like every single
meal is like down to the grain of like
what he's having his workout regime like
everything is revolved his entire
everything is revolved around being the
best at basketball if you want to be the
best at something that's that's what it
takes like insanity like pure Obsession
complete Obsession now if your goal is
to be hey I want to crush 5 10 that's a
very different goal you can put in 40
hours a week maybe 30 hours a week of
play 10 hours a week of study and you
can be an absolute Crusher at 510 live
and earn a very good living you know 200
250k 300K a year like very good money
but like I think the first step to work
ethic
is realizing like what is a realistic
work ethic for me going to look like
what would I be happy with and then
setting a goal that aligns with a
realistic work ethic for
yourself yeah and then from there
building those daily habits that
correlate with that goal because as you
mentioned at some points especially as a
poker player self-accountability is what
happens like you're accountable it's you
you wake up what time you go you you
grind what time you study what time and
you solve all those problems obviously
like you're stable maybe some coaching
can help you uh fill in a few of those
gaps with some accountability but for
the most part it's on you but yeah
really like to get the goal clear
understand what that involves and then
start building those habits to to close
the gap between you say you want to be
goalwise and then how you're showing up
and then of often there's a massive gap
between those two uh versions of
yourself and yeah I hear it as well a
lot like I want to be the best and it's
like I'm pretty confident you don't want
the lifestyle the best I'm pretty
confident if you want to be the best
right now you'd be telling me all the
hundred things you're currently doing
every single day and you can't sleep
because you're so obsessive and you're
not telling me that you're telling me
you can't study because you're not
motivated I don't think you're really
going to be there so yeah I think it's
just that realistic uh reality media but
also then building work ethic I do think
work ethic is very much like a muscle I
do feel like wherever you're at we've OB
built habits that can make you think
that you're lazy or you lack work ethic
in reality like get the goal clear
understand why you want that get that
kind of motive behind it clear then
start building that work ethic muscle by
understanding your current points and
then adding layers on if you currently
work five hours a week you're not going
to do 80 hour weeks next week you might
do seven hours or eight hours in
progressively overloading that work
ethic so you me match the goal that you
want to get and it might take some take
some time like working on the gym takes
time to get stronger you've got to be
kind of consistent so yeah I really like
how you covered that one yeah it's just
like you said the gym it's just like
Progressive overload right you can't
just like you can't go into the gym and
go from benching 135 pounds to benching
185 right you you you add 2.5 pounds
next week and then you add one rep right
it's like it's that you it's the same
thing with work ethic I really like the
point you made because like it takes
time it's a very slow process like work
ethic is a skill just like anything
else yeah when someone says I haven't
got work EIC I'm not I don't work that
hard it's like you haven't learned to do
that yet it's like you can't lift that
Weir because you're not strong yet so
yeah it's defend when it relates to not
quite developing the workout that muscle
yet just stick at it understand your
current Baseline add a little bit on and
yeah over time you will develop that all
right the final piece that we put
together before we go into your story
which is normally the star in PL of
these conversations so we've did a bit
of reverse um this this one was greed
you mentioned fear and greed being the
two obstacles so only through how
players can overcome greed they say
they've notice it in thems it's a strong
Drive how the players start to
understand it better but also move past
it just because we have a very strong
hand doesn't mean we just get to bet
huge and I think so many players get
caught up in I has good hand I bet big
money and that's not the best way to
make the most amount of money
particularly like if your opponent has a
very weak range right and so that's
that's where like the the the backstory
behind like the whole infers concept
came was trying to fix that greed
was asking what would I do with the
inverse
because if you want to make the most
amount of money playing live poker you
just need to be responding to what your
opponents are doing and if your opponent
is screaming at the top of their lungs I
don't have a good hand it doesn't matter
that you have a full house right you
can't just be piling in all of the
money yeah I like that kind of going to
the inverse it's often like to uh to
counter a bias often a bias like has us
go on one side of the fence and to
counter that bias obviously be ideal to
be in the middle all the time and not be
to one side but often we' go the
opposite way to kind of find that kind
of that sweet spot um how do you feel
with players like because GRE can show
up in a lot of ways GRE can also show up
in time terms of being very uh
shortsighted wanting to win now let's
say you're down a few binds in a session
and the greed kicks in by I want to get
back even I want to be up this session
and it's this kind of this urge for a
quick result or a big result can can can
C in how do you get players to deal with
that when they're you maybe struggling
not so much in just one decision point
but the feeling of wanting to uh have an
outcome in the short term that's a tough
one because it's it's really hard people
can understand the mindset of it's all
one long session right in every decision
we need to make the highest EV play in
order to get to those win rates that we
previously thought were unattainable and
people can understand that and they can
say it and they can voice it out loud
but it's it's it's it's similar to the
one we were talking about earlier of
just like you have to jump like you you
have to you have to actually buy in and
believe that each hand is its own like
it starts over at this hand right it
doesn't matter what happened less hand
we need to make the highest DV decision
in every single hand going forward and
even breaking it down even further on
like a a micro level like it doesn't
matter that we made a mistake on the
flap we need to make the highest DV
decision now with what has happened on
the turn and I try to beat that home so
much because there's usually a big gap
between people understanding it and
actually applying
it yeah I think a lot of mindset can go
into that category where the the
knowledge is often there but the
application of that knowledge takes time
it takes a repetitive often reminding
over and over of what you're trying to
achieve and how your current actions are
misaligned often with the goal you're W
in so for example let's say those your
greeding you're putting big bets in on
the river that you're doing that because
you want to have a big cash reward in
the short term on you start to realize
actually this is L me eeve over the long
term okay how can we realign what I'm
trying to achieve with the actions but
yeah as you mentioned it's often easier
said than don't but the definitely the
awareness and the kind of reminder as
constant is going to be the the path
there all right I want to now start by
getting to know you Mark and you've
share a lot of wisdom with us so far
today and I'm sure that audience are
loving it and go wow M Mark super clever
we also want to know your story how you
got to where you are now now when I
Googled you add your name I feel like
found the wrong profile at first but I
think it was the right one it says I am
a retired school bus driver now I make
music music so we can jump in the story
wherever you want but let's talk about
you getting to be a poker player and
yeah where do you want to jump in the
journey do you want to start with a bus
drive do you want to go into how you
became a competitive guy we could skip
the bus driving par because that's kind
of boring but I moved to Los Angeles for
music in late
2016 at the time I was
actually I'd been making music
for eight years nine years and was kind
of feeling burnt out and it was just
right at that time where I was like I'm
burnt out I'm not enjoying this it's not
fun when I had a song that like started
blowing up and so I was getting calls
from labels I never wanted to sign to a
record label ever because I always
wanted to be my own boss I'm not good
working for other people and when you
have a record label you now have a boss
or many bosses and so I didn't want to
sign a record deal but I was quite
interested in signing a publishing deal
where I could
write for others and collect a large
check for that and so I was meeting with
a bunch of labels songwriting companies
in LA and the meetings were getting
serious I was having a lot of
songwriting sessions so I thought you
know what let's I just need to go I just
need to get to Los Angeles and let's try
to make this thing work let's give it
like one final shot and so I moved I had
a friend who was a songwriter and he
said you can move in with me just bring
all your recording equipment you can
live here for free only stipulation is
you just have to let me record sometimes
I'm like cool that sounds amazing moved
to LA had no rent and I get there and
he's like okay cool I'm bringing in a
team we're recording my album for the
next two weeks like what am I going to
do I had been
playing one two and 13 in St Louis where
I'm from and I was making I don't know
26 27 bucks an hour at
13 and I had a job passing out energy
drinks out of the back of a truck in St
Louis and that was my job I was making
like $15 an hour to support myself so I
could do music music was starting to
make money but not enough and I had the
same job lined up in LA and I remember
asking a friend I said you know I'm
making like 25 bucks an hour playing
poker in St Louis you know I could play
55 in La do you think I could make like
30 bucks an hour because if so like I
won't need this job and he's like yeah
you could you could probably do it and
so I went to play 55 I had I brought
just around a $10,000 bankroll with me
to LA to play 55 and my first week I
doubled the bank
roll I called the energy drink company
and said you know what I'm not going to
need that job I'm not going to need it
and at that point it was just um most of
my songwriting sessions were at night so
I'd play poker during the day go to
songwriting sessions at night and that's
uh that's kind of how it started in
2016 well so yeah you mentioned ear with
Rene that you like the art rather than
the science and I'm guessing obviously
music very creative very artistic how
did you made that jump into poker and
how were kind of the your day-to- day
way of showing up and being creative how
did that change from being an artist
Crea a music to go into little of Po it
was hard to turn one off and turn the
other one on because I found I was kind
of living like these like two
lives and all of my friends in La at the
time were artists they were rappers
singers
producers and so very creative people
who were living this sort of lifestyle
and then I'm playing poker and it's like
just very very analytical and I found
the more poker I played almost the
harder it became to to write because I
my brain was becoming so analytical that
it was kind of losing that like free
flowing thought process and so I I
really kind of struggled balancing it
and I'd go through
like stretches where I would just you
know hey this week I'm not really
feeling it I'm just going to play poker
this week and then for the next three
weeks I'm just gonna I I made a good
amount of money and like for the month
already now for the next three weeks
it's just like it's it's it's knock out
an album time for like three weeks and
that's kind of I kind of went back and
forth because it was really hard to go
from one to the
other at which point did you make the
switch to go all in our poker and how
challenging was that to almost like say
goodbye to the old identity of being a
musician I know one of those things
where you've done something for a long
time and you can kind of see the new
Choice you're saying yes to is going to
basically be the death of that old
version of you and that can be very
painful especially if you put eight G in
the music you've SE attraction you've
got all your friends in it going to
Poker you kind of at some point that
when you do a fulltime yeah to for that
transition when you did do that and how
it felt for
you I think one of the reasons if I'm
being honest why I was able to have so
much early success in poker was because
my identity was not wrapped up in poker
and whether I won or lost it wasn't I am
good at this therefore I am a good
person or I lost therefore I am a bad
person because I cared about music 10
times more and so the losses and wins
and swings didn't really get to me all
that much at the beginning because it
wasn't my sense of identity it I wasn't
really in my mind I'm not a poker player
I'm just playing poker to pay the bills
and so I struggled with the ups and
downs a lot less I think at the
beginning and in my mind I never really
fully committed to Poker although
after my first year in La like after my
first six months in La I was basically
playing full-time I was playing 35 Plus
hours a week 40 hours a week
poker and I just kept thinking you know
it'd be silly for me like I've never I
was making $15 an hour man like I and
all of a sudden like I'm making 7075
bucks an hour playing 55 and it's like
holy crap I'd be an idiot not to go play
more I don't know how long this is going
to last this is like to good to be true
and so I just played more and more
because I was like I had you know I I
had gotten my own place I got in an
apartment with a friend and the rent was
relatively low you know low for LA but
still relatively low and I didn't have
many expenses and so I was like let's
let's just stack money as quickly as I
can and I never really
fully distanced myself from the artist
until Co I think and I made the project
I've kind of always wanted to make and
did not caring if it's going to do well
not caring what the recep is going to be
just what I wanted to make and
everything I've always wanted to say and
I felt like when I finished that album
that was
it a clear end point and a clear
transition to the start new thing so you
mentioned like with Rene that's
everyone's a bad player 99% and I'm sure
when you started you were also in that
category of a bad player and mrly Theory
how did you go about improving your live
play and becoming a good player what
what kind of the things you you worked
on I'm serious seen like the the me the
midwit meme and I think at the beginning
I was so dumb that I was good it was
kind of like because my thoughts were
literally what are this guy's two cards
and what does my hand want to do against
this guy's two cards that was literally
all I thought about in every single hand
and people played so face up that it was
really easy to do that I started
learning I started studying I started
getting into
Theory and then you know I made the jump
after one year I went from 55 and I
started playing 51020 the weird thing
about La there's only one place that
really spreads like straight 510 and
it's not a fun place to play so you kind
of like if you don't want to play there
the jump from 5'5 is pretty much
straight to 1020 and so I jumped to
51020 and I had started studying Theory
and I was doing stuff like a whale would
three bet me and I would four bet ace5
suited because that's what you're
supposed to do or like i' get to the
river and I'd be like you know what I
unblock all of his Bluffs I block some
of his value so I'm going to call here
or I'm at the top of my range so I'm
going to call and then surprisingly I
went on a 600 hour break even stretch
when I started playing 51020 and I was
like what is going on I'm better now and
I realized how badly I was misapplying
stuff after about a year
H so how did you come out of this so
we've got this kind of first real down
swing I think you mentioned this was
2018 a be year after the plan and 600
hours of life I'm sure that's a very
long period of your life to look back on
and it must feel even longer whilst you
live in it how would you one come out
the other side of it but two also want
to keep going what made you think okay
this PO of thing still for me at this
stage your
career my wife who was my girlfriend at
the time she said something that really
stuck with me she
said everything you've ever done in your
life you get good at and then you
quit and I'm not going to let you quit
poker and so that hit and I just started
showing up I would going through a 600
hour break even stretch I played 75
hours a week until I got out of it like
I would show up at 10 a.m. when the game
started play till 6:00 p.m. drive to
another casino get there at 700 and then
play till midnight and do that six or
seven days a week and I did that for
months until I started making a bunch of
money again and I just like that for me
like something just clicked and my work
ethic work ethic kind of went from not
too good to to improving very very
quickly what was the mindset through the
downswing I'm always curious to know
when someone like leans into a hard time
and it's like I'm going to get out of
this there's often like a mindset
they're leaning into going be a
long-term future or I'm going to get the
side of this I'm going to prove people
wrong for you what was the uh the over
rushing mindset that allowed you to to
put those 75 hours in when you're R even
losing I basically had like a victim
mindset like why is this happening to me
I don't deserve this why is everybody
why is that guy running so good and that
was my mindset for like six months or
five months and it was not helpful
that's not it's not helpful it's not a
way to uh to change anything
and eventually I just like what Liz told
me like it just it just clicked and I
just realized like you know what I can
either look at this like why
me this is horrible or I can look at it
like this is just going to be a mountain
that I'm going to climb and every time
someone's thrown a mountain in my P in
my life so far I've just turned around
and walked
home and if the mountain isn't hard to
climb this thing can't be that rewarding
because then everybody could do it so
I'm going to prove to myself for the
first time in my life that I'm not a
quitter when you try to do that will you
wrestle in with any self-doubt any uh
cuz when you haven't done something
before there's inner Narrative of well
this isn't going to work for me here we
go again another obstacle ready to quit
again and and you're trying to override
that by going no this is my time this my
rocking movie this is where I'm going to
step up and show it to the world but
internally there's also the inner voice
which is going here we go Mark ready to
quit are you ready to throw it in so how
are you pushing past that music helped a
lot because music is so subjective and
in music I never had an
answer is this good I don't know I could
think it's good a few people could think
it's good but that doesn't mean anything
poker the thing is you have data you
have numbers and I had 2500 hours of
data at that point that told me I was a
pretty [ __ ] good poker player and so
I just leaned into that as hard as I
could they're like hey you've done this
like youve you've beat 55 for 16 17 big
blinds an hour that's not a fluke like
you're doing something right let's
figure out what you're doing wrong and
let's fix it because like this isn't
objective anymore you have enough data
to know that you can beat these games
and I think just like leaning back on
the objectivity of it like it really
really
helped yeah it feels like maybe for the
first time you've got data on your s
rather than just that subjective feeling
like you said with music you putting
stuff out there is it good who's who's
the judge of that overall it's really
hard I always struggle with English
compared to Maths for this exact reason
write an essay and I go is this good I'm
like well what what makes it good like
what's the structure what's the exact
like a good story is a good story Adam
just write a good one I'm like math
that's right that's wrong there's clear
boundaries I can learn that better so
yeah this kind of is a good with poker
we've got a more defined version of that
so we can lean on that sometimes when
things are going badly so it feels like
for you potentially that was a a good um
kind of Aid in this kind of transition
of yourself to to overcome it and then
you mentioned from this point things
started turn around and you started have
a lot of success once you realize you
are misapplying Theory and you also
start to increase your work ethic sry
for this of transition period how you uh
start to tap into these exploits you're
currently doing now and how you kind of
set your game up when you start to
realize that you approach it wrong so I
brought back what had worked for me
before which was
hey I'm playing against a guy who's
never who doesn't even know how to spell
a solver right you don't know how to
spell pile solver so like maybe against
this guy I should go back to playing
what are my two cards and what do my two
cards want to do and maybe I can take
some of that theory stuff I learned
and when I'm playing against some of the
tougher Rags at 51020 maybe that's the
time to start applying it but when I'm
in a pot against a guy who's four beers
deep maybe not right so like I I started
trying to apply it in the spots where it
was more applicable instead of just this
overall encompassing like let's play a
good theoretical game I got too trapped
in I want to play good
poker and at the beginning I did not
give a [ __ ] about playing good poker
because my identity was not wrapped up
in poker at all and as my identity
became more poker and the music became
more in the back burner I think the
problem was that hey I want to look I
want people to think I'm a good poker
player and so let's play what looks like
good
poker and I think I got way too fixated
on that and I I pulled that back and
realized hey what makes a good poker
player is how much money you win at the
end of the year right not what the Ragan
seat 3 thinks if you're good or not who
cares who cares if I make more money
than him who
cares yeah it comes back to this kind of
analogy again of the fears of Mak
mistakes fears of not being good or
looking good and then being will to be
brave and go for the exploits go to the
dance floor go ask the girl out be like
step into your the discomfort of the
unknown but also with an element of
confidence in yourself that you can
handle it so uh one question I want to
ask around this is how do you develop
the confidence in yourself to be able to
do this dance to play this exploitive
style and to find the solutions so you
mentioned that the top one% of players
have curiosity and the way you're
speaking here I can tell you've got that
dialed in and you're able to think of
what would these two cards want to do
and then come with the export of
strategy against Big Jeremy to do that
but other players might be like okay I
understand what you're saying but I
maybe don't have the confidence in
myself to come up with these Expo of
strategies against these players so for
you how do you build confidence that you
were this kind of problem solver who
could plan the kind of uncertainty but
come out on top of it
because every day when I would sit down
to write music I was depressed I was not
excited to do it and then I thought you
know
what let's open up pile solver and let's
start looking at like what the
equilibrium here is in this spot let's
see how this guy is may be
deviating let's go on YouTube and let's
like learn how to node lock let's start
playing with this and let's figure out
like oh well if he checks these hand and
that just like I was excited I went from
being like morose and depressed and like
I don't want to do anything until like I
could do this stuff for 12 hours a day
and for me it was like it just clicked
like I'm excited to wake up and do this
every day and it just didn't feel like
work it felt like I want to know these
answers like I'm driven to know these I
really want to know what's what's
happening like how do I I heard this
guy's winning $112 an hour how do I win
115 all right let's let's jump in and
spend 10 hours like poking at things and
if those 10 hours aren't fruitful if I
don't learn any like have any big
picture takeaways that's okay I sure I
had a shitload of fun figuring out some
stuff today right I can apply something
down the road and for me it was like it
just felt like this whole whole world of
possibilities had opened and that I was
I was having fun again it felt like yeah
I'm I'm doing something
that brings excitement every
day yeah I think that's when you know
you're on the right path when that
curiosity is just so high that the
excitement the natural drive to want to
learn to improve is just driving all
your behaviors I'm curious to know
curious to know um can you tap into this
can you hack your way into curiosity so
let's say player are not feeling that
same excitement they want to get better
but they're a bit like you with music
they're like H going to the Sola looking
at some stuff they're like all right go
do my drills they're like trying to
think of some strategies is there any
ways you can think with your players
that you do to uh to cultivate more
excitement more enjoyment more curiosity
with a player who may be likeing that
why are you playing poker
then right like what is your what what
do you want from poker what do you want
to get out of it and if you don't enjoy
studying if you don't enjoy the learning
part of it if you don't enjoy the let's
dig in and jump in this like why are you
playing maybe it's just like well you
know I have I I I enjoy socializing at
the table maybe it's like you know I I
enjoy playing with friends for a few but
like if you're not obsessed over it like
I am that's okay but you're just going
to have to adjust the goals because you
can't force a square peg into a round
hole like if it's if if it's a poker is
hard man there is so many downsides and
not that many upsides to Poker and so if
you don't love it if you don't wake up
every day like this is what I want to do
today and every day for the near-term
future why why do it you could do a
million other things find something else
that brings you that Curiosity
because I really believe that a lot of
people just don't try enough
things and maybe poker just maybe
poker's meant to be a 10-hour a week
hobby maybe it's not meant to be a
career right so like you can't force
someone to be excited maybe that's just
not the thing like music was for me it
eventually become a thing that just
didn't get me excited anymore and that's
okay yeah I think it comes down to not
trying to make it something something
that not and been okay with that I think
a lot of players maybe have their
identity wrapped up in being a poker
player maybe lose that Curiosity over
time and say right maybe life's telling
you poker's going to be a small box of
your life maybe you need for money
financially but at some point you need
to find your your next thing your next
journey and it could they could find
music is their next thing or some other
Adventure I think that what I find a bit
worried about the porker players in
general is they often box themsel in to
just poker say well if I don't play
porker I haven't got a job what else I'm
going to do going to do it's like
there's a million things you could do
like there there's so many paths you
could take how exciting to try and
figure that out what you actually like
as an adult rather trying to figure out
what you like as an 18-year-old and pick
a career but on that why not trying and
figure it out in your 30s 40s what you
like so yeah really resonate with that
enough trying to force that process of
trying to spot that Curiosity you
mentioned with Ren which I thought was a
very interesting analogy about
equilibrium being like the Seesaw and it
made me think that you've probably spent
a lot of time thinking about Concepts in
different ways to other people and yeah
just to me for like how you've come to
that kind of way of thinking about
equilibrium as a as a kind of concept of
Poker but also some other Concepts that
maybe you've reframed for yourself in
ways that other players might not have
thought of in terms of the fragility of
equilibrium I'm obsessed with I I think
let me rephrase it I think you don't
really understand a concept until you
can explain a complex concept to someone
very
simply so for me the way I really know
that I understand something is if I'm
able to distill it down to three or four
sentence and just explain it to somebody
like a 5-year-old right and so like I'm
obsessed with like learning something so
well and simp Ying it and squeezing out
if I can squeeze out 98% of the juice
out of something but to it down to a
concept that is so basic that everybody
can understand like that to me is like
that's the most exciting thing in the
world
and I think I started this kind of when
we started as a stable and we were
taking on players who were playing you
know two five 510 1020 and playing live
full time and eventually we got to the
point where we had 20 plus players all
over the country and it was like okay if
we can unlock something this week that
increases everybody's win rate by one
big blind per hour that's a [ __ ] ton of
money and so we were just obsessed GTH
and I my business part we were just
obsessed with
like let's just dive into the data let's
just dive in let's just how can we
improve out of position single race pots
how can we improve three bet pots in
position how can we give these guys more
of a framework so that they can all just
slightly increase their win rate this
week what should we work on this week
and we were just obsessed with it and
that's where like the building blocks of
like all of these kind of strategies
that we've put together the foundations
of how we think about live poker just
kind of became crystallized
because we both had all these ideas but
they weren't something that was it's
just like okay like think what is this
guy's two cards how does your hand want
to play against it you can't just tell
somebody that and have them go play good
poker right so we had to build guide
rails we had to build an entire
framework we had to build a system and
the only reason we were incentivized to
do that at the beginning was because
like hey if we can just we can add a
little bit to
everybody this thing becomes a lot more
profitable so that's how it kind of
started yeah I love it and you mentioned
if you're an expert in something you
have to be able to distill out very
simply to a 5-year-old or that kind of
level and that's actually really hard to
do because you need to to extract what
the Core Essence of the thing is and
remove everything else and you need to
know what can I remove and what can't I
remove so when you used equilibrium as a
say so analogy I instantly saw that
working so I like okay yeah it carries
the same Baseline of there's a a point
where it's kind of static but also small
changes can completely change the the
dynamic of what equilibrium looks like
it's like a a very simple thing but once
you see it I can understand it a
five-year-old can understand it and that
show is like all right you've you
haven't lost anything of value from the
concept maybe a small few nuances but
overall you've captured the essence I
think that's a very hard skill like it's
not an easy skill to to learn so yeah I
was impressed with that one I'm curious
got other ones but maybe later in the
conversation we can H uncover a few and
I want to go into your your journey and
we've Al we've got you to so far going
for down swing in 2018 we've got you to
uh um kind of quitting music in around
Co time and deciding that poker was
going to be your path and things
starting to uh pick up from there so
yeah let's let's jump in the story Co
times talk us through first of all how
you were getting through that period and
how that set you with full fa success so
I
was I had ever since 2017 I had moved in
gotten an apartment with a friend after
I moved out of that first place where I
was living for free gotten an apartment
with a friend who is a
rapper and we had lived together for
three years Co came around and him and
his girlfriend decided they were going
to get a house
and my wife who was my girlfriend at the
time was planning on making the move out
to LA but Co was kind of putting a huge
delay on things because no one was
hiring there was a hiring free she
couldn't get a job in La so I was like
what am I going to do like now I don't
have a roommate I got to get a she's not
going to move here yet I got to get a
place so I found this tiny little guest
house in
beverlywood moved my studio in there and
by
day wake up at 9:00 or 10:00 a.m. every
day which I don't I don't do that now
but that was that was during Co I'm an
early boy now but start playing online
where I was playing a mix of some app
games I was playing some
ignition and I would play online until
around dinner time until around 6 p.m.
play eight hours clock out eat dinner
and then go down the hall into the
studio and record music all night and I
just there was nothing else to do it was
Co right like everything was shut down
especially in LA and and so I just
worked eight hours a day on poker eight
hours a day on music and that was it
seven days a week the only way I knew
what day of the week it was was on
Sundays I would have shrimp so I would
know it was Sundays like I ate the same
food every single day except Sundays I
would have shrimp so I would know it was
a Sunday and that was the only way I
kept track of time and for like four
months or something like that just me in
this little tiny 600 foot
house just 16 hours a day of work and
that changed my life that changed
everything for
me in what
way I made more money than I had ever
made I put a bow on the music career
that I had kind of thrown on the back
burner that was kind of tugging at me
and I was able to kind of wrap up that
identity and close that chapter of my
life
I got my [ __ ] together like financially
emotionally came to terms with a lot of
stuff that I hadn't dealt
with um my mom
passing
just stuff that I hadn't dealt with in
life and like
those four months I feel like
financially emotionally spiritually just
like work ethic wise everything it just
completely
changed who I am and I feel like I came
out the other side with just a much
better more complete
person wow yeah and I think Co was such
an interesting period for everyone we
all were forced insight and to be kind
of by ourselves a little bit more with
our own thoughts it was a great
opportunity to uh recalibrate think
about we want to do to build new habits
routines to process things that we
haven't had to deal with but also other
people would do the inverse and just
distract themselves find just things
that would um occupy them so yeah it's
very interesting I think it was a almost
like a fork in the road moment of time
where people just went one way or the
other way and some people came out with
this like yourself in a very good
situation others came out almost like
depressed very down very um lacking
Direction so when cover ended and live
casino start open was your was your
intention always to play live as soon as
it reopened and then how did that
transition unfold when things actually
did did did reopen yeah I started
playing live again
and uh my my wife moved we got a house
together in La moved in together and got
engaged and um played live
again and I was kind of uh kind of
disappointed with it
because I felt like I'd reached a
ceiling I felt like I'd climbed mountain
and was at the kind of the top of the
mountain and there was no more mountain
to climb and so that kind of started the
next chapter
because live public games even in a
place like La the biggest you can play
is like 1020
10240 and when you've been playing those
games for a while and you've been
beating up those games for a while like
it's like okay this is fine the money's
good I'm doing well but what's next like
what is the what is the next progression
and I kind of ran into that that head
first after covid because those were
kind of the same Stakes I had played in
2019 and so I wanted to do something
bigger do something better I just I knew
I had to have a
change and why that change lead you to
well there were three options it was
either go down the private game route
which I didn't want to do for a lot of
reasons um cheating the people um just
kind of a dark place in general the
private games in
La had some friends who had spent a lot
of time in those games and didn't want
to go down that route the other one was
okay so I
could play tournaments because
tournaments everything's public right so
like I could just play like large field
mtts I could play Big bayans like me try
that but I'd played quite a few you know
not a few but I I played the main event
every year which is like the best
tournament right 10K Buy in Main Event
soft field and every year I would rather
stick a catheter in my phold and play a
live t like I sit down at the table and
I'm like 30 minutes in I'm like why did
I do this I hate it so much so I'm like
that's not an option option
three
well was just jumping back into online
and trying to climb to as high stakes as
I could online so at that point I
started streaming on on Twitch GTH my
friend started coaching me for online he
had an online
background and I started you know
started streaming at 500 quickly moved
up to
1K um and was doing well but I hated
streaming and I quickly
grew uh I quickly grew bored with
online not because it wasn't hard it was
very very hard and I I was working very
hard just to be you know a five six big
blind per 100 winner not like a crazy
amount but doing pretty well but I was
working hard just to maintain that win
rate
but it felt very robotic and mechanical
and didn't the part of me is always will
always be an artist and I felt like it
just didn't provide that the same sense
of going off into the Wilderness that
deep 300 400 big blind poker provided
and I I I missed
that so from that moment was there a
clear game selection for you to go into
or did you have to make some bigger
changes to find those live games that
would allow that progression but also
that enjoyment because sounds like for
you you always want to be pushing
yourself to play higher to play in like
bigger lineups or tougher competition
and then also there's the yeah what
games are available for you at that that
moment so how do you solve that problem
so I started getting to play some of the
Hustler streams I was playing as big as
like 100 200 200 400
and uh that was great
but I just didn't have access to those
games enough it was I would get to play
those games maybe on stream maybe twice
a month and then off stream there would
be like a game that would run once a
week and I get invited to the game like
once a month so I was getting spots in
those games once a week which just
wasn't really enough because I had all
this other time so it's like what do I
do with all this other time and that's
when you know I had a
friend that was moving back to LA he
wanted to play 510 I was like you know
what let's uh maybe maybe I can help you
out maybe we could do a little coaching
like I know you played five five last
time and you want to play a little
bigger so I'll give you money to play
give me a piece we'll do coaching once a
week started doing that with him
there was another player I had met
during an app game I had played during
Co and this guy was a maniac but I could
tell he was a smart Maniac he was really
bad but he was one of those guys who
just had no fear just zero fear and I
find that's like really really hard to
find and I connected with this guy I you
know I reached out to the the guy who
ran the app game I'm like who is this
guy and he's like oh he lives in La I'm
like wow okay so I reached out to this
guy and I'm like hey this is we but I'm
someone saw on the app like just wanted
to talk we talk on the phone he had only
played live poker one time but he like
he was obsessed he he wanted to play so
I started coaching him he started
playing 55 immediately lost 10K at 55
which I thought was absurd because I had
never lost more than 5K at 55 ever I
gave him another 10K and he won 28k his
first month after that playing 55 he
moved up to 51020 so I was coaching him
I found another guy who I had met
through music and he was playing online
I'm like how do you feel about live he's
like well I never played but I'll try it
So eventually I had three guys and
gethin who had been my online coach was
like What if we expand this thing
together and like start building a
stable and eventually it went from 3 to
5 to 10 to 20 we eventually had 22 guys
playing full-time all across the country
and that became a full-time job because
I could only play high stakes maybe once
a
week what made you gravitate towards
coaching players have you always had
that kind of pull to uh teach strategies
to help people obviously it's a
different type of Lifestyle than
grinding yourself all the time what made
you move towards coaching and take on
these initials guys because you're being
very proactive here you're ringing the
guy up going hey I think you've got some
talents I can I can train you up what do
you think kind of let you that way
because I love building strategies and
fixing problems and like diagnosing
leaks and like that part of Poker to me
is the most exciting part of Poker
whereas sometimes just sitting there for
six hours like at a table nothing
happens or you have to hear the guy next
to you like rant about how he hates his
wife or politics or whatever and like
you're just like this is horri but like
the strategy part to me is like amazing
and like I could spend and like so I was
like wow like I just get to help these
guys with strategy that sounds like the
best part of Poker and then I can do
that five days a week and then I can
just go in and play high stakes once a
week like this sounds amazing so to me
it sounded like The Best of Both
Worlds I love that I love that like kind
of creative problem solving almost where
you're like well I like this part of
poker the strategy side how can I just
align my life with that part if I just
do more of that and then I can play
these games which aren't available too
often occasionally how does that work
all right I need maybe I just learn
strategy and teach it other guys it's
just interesting how we can find these
Solutions if we're creative enough and
we're able to think outside the box of

choices towards this curiosity again
this kind of what you enjoy doing if
you're doing that you'll always find a
path whether it's a direct path or some
hybrid strategy so find a way to uh make
money or align your curiosity with um

the weekly coaching webinars of which
one every month is with me looking
forward on educating you guys over
there you mentioned in our questionnaire
what sets you apart two things work
ethic and leverage we've already touched
on work ethic let's talk about leverage
how do you feel like you use leverage to
your benefit
I I'm obsessed like I've become like
ever since starting the stable like I
became obsessed with we we we wanted to
build the stable into a bit so I guess I
have to step back for one step and we
wanted to build the stable into a
successful
business and of the players we took on
we had an interview process that we
constantly refined and we got better at
but we were still [ __ ] at picking
players like they go through the
interview process
and some of them would they would all
turn into winning players right they
would all turn into winning players they
would make money and
then something would
snap they'd lose
5K and something would just break where
they they would all of a sudden just
lose all their confidence and start
playing horribly or they would just they
would just quit and they'd be 8K in
makeup and they would just quit and we'd
never get that money back and we didn't
know how to fix that because we were we
could help people with
strategy we didn't know how to help them
with the mental side we didn't know how
to help them with work
ethic and those were the two biggest
hurdles and the business was making
money but for the amount of time we were
putting in we were like you know what we
could just go play 24 1020 and make way
more money we're enjoying this but it's
probably not a great business right now
what can we do to make this a Better
Business and so that's how we kind of
shifted from the full staking model and
coaching for profit into evolving into
what we are now and as we started to
build the business one of the things I
realized
was I really enjoy learning new
skills and I didn't think I would like
that
because it's hard at first because like
you you really suck like you you suck at
something you're horrible at it and it's
just hard but like I started real like
it just gave me like it just it it gave
me like joy to be able to like be go
from being a complete beginner to like
competent at something and so I would
take something like video
editing and I would just become obsessed
with it for three months or six months
and I would get go from novice to
competent not great but competent and
then what I could do was I could take a
poker player who knew nothing about
video editing who was struggling at
poker and didn't really want to play
fulltime and say
hey you want to work in poker and edit
videos and because I could teach myself
that skill then I could teach somebody
else that skill and then I could fire
myself from that job and so that's what
I did for the first essentially two
years of Hungry Horse is I was just
learn a skill get good enough at it so I
could teach somebody else and then fire
myself from it and that's been the way
I've been kind of able to apply Leverage
is just by continually learning new
skills and stacking them and then hiring
somebody to do this skill so I can learn
this
one yeah using skills as leverage and
once you master one skill they'll
Outsource that if it's a lower level
skill so you can play like in a higher
skill escalation game so you mentioned
that players struggling with with this
kind of losing going on these bad
streaks even when youve turned them into
win a player overall how did you guys
start to to solve that problem or at
least give some guidance to those
players who who were going through those
period of 5K in the hall doubting their
choices maybe getting stuck there and
yeah how did you uh help players in
those situations we've never been able
to figure that out to be honest because
for
me mine was Liz telling me you quit
everything and something just
snapping and for gin
He's just never had that issue at all
and he played his whole background he
started online and he was just a crazy
sit Ando rag on poker stars and then he
became a c cash Rag and like Supernova
lead on poker star and like he just
never had that he was just an insane
robot who just like that [ __ ] didn't
affect him and so we never really became
we realized like this is not really our
skill set we can help somebody become
really good at poker but we can't we
don't have the answers for the mental
side because for us it was either in my
case just plowing my head through a wall
or for him just never really dealing
with it so we weren't good at that and
maybe that's why we didn't have as much
success as we wanted as a stable because
we had the strategy side figured out but
the mental game side which we realized
was a much bigger component than we
thought it
was yeah that's the challenge right it's
almost like the the conscious and the
subconscious mind like the subconscious
below the surface the conscious is the
strategy of what you need to execute
everyone to see how that's going to help
then below the surface there's a lot of
things that can go wrong that are hard
to address unless you yeah approach it
from the right lens of development
skills that are going to help players
with the mindset but yeah I can
empathize with that being a challenge
and players comeing with different
problems and if you haven't experienced
those things yourself it's really hard
to know how to help these guys as you
mentioned your partner at the time was
able to give you a really good uh pep
talk to get you through a tough obstacle
but other players maybe are struggling
in different ways there's often
Financial pressures there's often yeah
other issues that they have to have to
address the to come to the sides so um
I'm curious to know for you how do you
deal with making mistakes so you've
mentioned like in this conversational
lart about kind of being brave going for
exploits when you're in the exploit Camp
I'm guessing the chance of making big
mistakes or big blenders is going to
increase as well and just been not be
okay with that I think you mentioned
like not blot of players fear making
mistakes they fear like being brave
enough to step out of line because what
could come with that but it sounds like
for you you're very good at that at
least you're able to embrace making
mistakes as part of part of play style
of play so how do you deal with that how
how do you process a mistake and and use
that in a good way I still beat myself
up a lot to be honest and I'm much
better at the oh I got it in 910 and
this guy won who cares I don't care that
that I'm I'm numb to that that doesn't
bother me anymore the part where I'm not
good at
is wow I just put in 300 big blinds with
six high and this guy just called me
with second pair I was way off I am an
idiot like that part still it still gets
to me because when you go out on the
cliff like I do like you're wrong a lot
I'm wrong a lot of the time and I I
still do I need to get better at not
beating myself up and being but like the
thing is is like I'm I'm in there the
next day I'm in the lab the next day
like looking at this like
hm okay let's let's figure this out
let's figure out what went wrong so it
doesn't happen again and so I am
proactive about it in that way but I I I
think I could be better about being kind
to myself and the fact that like I'm
pretty brutal to myself when something
doesn't
work yeah it's interesting right cuz you
often have to wrestle with make a
mistake and how it makes you feel but I
I think what most matters is how it
makes you act after and for you if
you're proactive and you're learning
from mistakes that feeling of I don't
like this I'm hard on myself might be
just what you need for your personality
to actually go to the lab the next day
study that spot and spend three hours
really getting curious on it and the
other guy might be going oh made a
mistake I feel fine about it and because
he hasn't got that undering feeling of
disappointment annoyance in himself he
might just gloss over it look at herry
and go yeah kind of played it decent
move on so some those feelings that we
experience
might actually be guiding Us in the
direction we need to take I think what's
most important is the and then what what
next you felt this bad about M take and
that what happens so it's kind of if
you're fine with basically feeling a
little bit shitty for a while but also
being proactive um I think it's it's not
going to be a bad thing but it's this
balance a balance between being kind to
yourself being too kind being hard on
yourself being too hard and trying to
like find that sweet spot for yourself
to uh to steal your
behaviors I definitely a on the side of
uh your piece of [ __ ] never make that
happen again but like I I can't sleep
until I like I can't sleep until I've
spent three hours looking at it like now
I know the answer it won't happen again
I know the answer now it's like I won't
be able to do anything until I until I
have that
answer yeah it's interesting I always
feel like the the optimal is like a
midpoint between two extremes so it's
like you're really really hard on
yourself you beat yourself up so
strongly that you can't make any
progress cuz you're just ruminating
about what an idiot you are on the flip
side there's the guy going oh I'm all
it's fine with it I don't care no not a
care in the world just another mistake
part the game tree and you got the guy
in the middle is like mistake kind of
sucked should probably work on that
let's get to it and I don't like this
feel so it's like the the mid point of
those two extremes and often as you
mentioned like with the equilibrium
analogy when you're fall one way you
often need to go far the other way you
mentioned with questions on like River
spots the same with like kind of
character traits if you're quite far one
way you often need to go far the other
way the guy was a bit of a [ __ ] too
kind to himself like do some hard stuff
build some mental toughness cuz you're
you to to uh kind of soften yourself and
the guy who's a bit more David Doggins
put himself through hell it's like all
right we can bit of self-compassion
might go a little bit more towards that
midline and it's really hard because
like the optimal for each person is kind
of different and there's no like kind of
set like that is the way to do it but
often if you're too hard more kindness
be two kinds a bit more toughness I'm
trying to navigate those those kind of
uh
paradigms all right I'm going to tag in
Ren now as I noted that you mentioned
how much of a gravitation you head
toward learning strategies and yeah kind
of correlating your kind of days with
studying getting better pokam and Rene
this was kind of a simar for you you had
the simar Curiosity of you enjoyed going
deep into Sol strategies how do you feel
like players who uh maybe don't have
that itch to go that deep how do you
feel like they can miss things and I'm
trying to figure out the gap between you
two Mark and ren who do like to go deep
on strategy when players don't go as
deep what do you feel like they miss I I
think I think there's definitely one
thing that we touched on they don't have
a bigger goal for me most of the
learning happened when I set at a bigger
goal than just paying my bills because
that then triggers the question of okay
well if I want to try to become the best
then what should I do right oh you know
how can I win how can I double my win
rate in this in this game well let me
think about that maybe that that kind of
higher goal forces you to think
different about what you're doing
because your current approach led to a
current wiim rate so if you want a
higher wiim rate you need to change your
approach so then you start to rethink
everything that you're thinking and that
I think in my opinion in my experience
is the only way and it sounded like for
Mark was the same correct
Mark MH yeah
exactly yeah so so I would say that's
that's probably uh the most important
thing and in that man in that like fear
will come up uh you have to step out of
your comfort zone you have to you have
to face certain things I think earlier
in the conversation you talked a lot
about setting for example a higher ghou
and trying to move up stake for
example I don't recall exactly what you
guys are saying but you know what I
find that how we can get people out of
the fear I think we talked about
aggression right applying a lot of
aggression the key is to get out of that
fear you have to make people see that
what they're currently doing
is more fair or is worse than their new
approach and how do you do that by
zooming out so let's say for example you
want to move up okay I've had this with
with some students who stayed stuck at
like 200 or 500 L they were associating
moving up with more fear and more risk
than staying at the same level and I try
to make them see okay let's say you
don't move up you don't take that shot
and you just stay here let's zoom out
one year two years three years this is
and then you start to to see that your
current approach is actually way more
risky and will lead to way more fair
than taking that shot and having this
OPP opportunity of like way bigger
success or if that shot fills and you
find out that poker is just not for you
you prevent grinding years and years and
years and staying stuck at 200l and
being miserable it's better to find it
out right now and and spend all this
time you know you're still young and you
know go do something else right we
talked about that there's plenty of
other opportunities so seeing that
stagnating and staying where you are is
way more dangerous than taking the shot
that in my opinion is how you get people
out of out of that fear does that seem
seem to resonate yeah that's really
good um I wanted to touch on actually uh
a couple of things I thought the mental
game side that you're talking about
especially for the strategy and like I
said I listen to a lot of your videos
yeah you know it's very aggressive and
like I said Al also what you saw
struggle with right if your calibration
is off and the guy called you know it's
very it's very sensitive to the mental
game to play a very aggressive
exploitable style so naturally mental
game will be tougher and what I find
then for example online it's a bit
harder to for example pound on a Hotpot
if you can just show the data right the
data doesn't lie whereas in life you
cannot really show the data and you know
it's it's it's it's a bit harder I think
it's easier for people to build on the
strategy
um especially let's for example they
implemented and you have short-term
buyers you have a short-term outcome
where the first three big big blust that
they made they did not work well good
luck keeping that guy aboard in that
strategy you know it's it's it's this
the Str and I I experience the same
thing the strategy in isolation helping
people with strategy is not the problem
in coaching players it is really not it
is mental game it is performance aspect
it is soft skills around that it is
managing their career these are in my
opinion and in my experience uh coaching
a lot of players that's the hardest part
right and you guys also mentioned and
finding the right players right you also
mentioned that I was actually curious
like what are what are like red flags
that you know okay this guy you know bad
news this is this is not someone who who
you should who you should coach maybe
for some fellow coaches out there what
some red flx yeah so for the
stable we had a ton um the first was
like anytime they mentioned I have
plenty of money red flag they don't have
plenty of money because if you had
plenty of money you would not be coming
to us to stake
you right that's a that's a big red flag
or
like I used to play this
game now I play this game red
flag because they lost a ton of money
somehow or they are irresponsible with
money or they are in debt you don't want
people who are in debt because
that's when you get people who steal or
cheat or skim that's a red flag um it's
very hard to track as well like online
you know we can at least track data and
even then you know if people listen if
people want to hurt you and are ill
intended they they will they will scam
you obviously we can minimize the
chances but life you have no you have no
clue you have to trust his Worth right
another reason why it's a bad business
another reason and if you want to know
the number we had this whole interview
process right it and we would do three
rounds of
interviews and we would test like we
would ask a bunch of personal questions
to like get like the backstory the
financial questions and then we would do
like the poker test and honestly for
like the poker test you know what the
best test would we would give them like
hands and like hear their we wanted to
hear their thought process and we
developed this whole thing to hear the
thought process and after doing it for
two years
the best
question the board is Jack 7 Deuce name
all of the straight draws and then
timing them and seeing how quick I swear
that was literally all we had to that
could literally that question was better
than going through an entire hand
because if they could name the straight
draws in four seconds they knew enough
to learn the Strat like literally that's
all it took the strategies would click
if they could do that if not then they
could never learn the strategies it was
that simple simple yeah texture
recognition right if if they're good at
that if they can see the new on in the
texture yeah that make that actually
makes a lot of sense um I was wondering
about the period where you dedicated
yourself to online and you started to
worked
with GTH his name watch yes GTH what are
like what were some of the struggles
that you encountered transitioning from
live poker to online what were like some
of the adjustments you had to make in
your game
uh bluffing too much and folding too
much I was massively over bluffing and
turning hands with shown value into
Bluffs for no reason just because like
live that prints and it doesn't matter
if you have shown value if they're going
to fold range and I was just massively
over
folding because live the player pull
massively under Bluffs and so I had to
get very comfortable with hero calling
because I was not good at it and I had
to get much more like just give up with
the hands that weren't good bluff
candidates because people call you
online and so those those were the two
biggest adjustments I had to make in the
first like few
weeks was like some of the do you
remember like a big lesson that gin
taught you that really stuck with
you stop bluffing so much you big dummy
I mean that was pretty much he showed me
essentially he showed me how to study
efficiently equilibrium and just like
pull up spots very quickly and look at
okay uh bottom of their Bluff catching
range looks like this and so if they're
not calling with these hands you can
Bluff more and if they are calling with
these hands you should be toning down
the Bluffs and just like looking at like
what are the worst hands are supposed to
be calling with what are the worst hands
they supposed to be bluffing with and
like using those and extrapolating I'm a
pattern monkey basically I mean like I
can like the only thing I know is like
seeing patterns in the pool and then
extrapolating so once I was able to
start understanding how to look at a
spot very quickly I was able to make a
bunch of inferences like for example
when I was
playing um triple Broadway boards were
massively under bluffed and so Rags on
Triple Broadway boards I noticed were
massively over folding a correction and
so my adjustment was against reags in
the 1K NL player pool was just massively
over bluffing on Triple Broadway boards
I started massively over bluffing on Ace
High boards because those were also
under bluffed and therefore they were
overfolded by good Rags um I would look
at early vers early
spots players would just call too much
because when the range is tight like an
early vers early three bet pot
well every hand looks like a pretty good
bluff catcher when you're in an early
versus early re pop so they were just
calling a little bit too much so I just
started going thinner and turning the
Bluffs down like I'm a pattern monkey
and I would just like look at spots over
and over and just start making notes and
that's how I started winning a bunch
online that's actually very uh some very
solid stuff uh yeah in general you know
if if you if you want to make successful
Bluffs Bluff a lot where the pool
doesn't Bluff you're kind of protected
by the trend of the pool and you're
protected by the in you're kind of
playing into the intuition that players
have built facing a lot of barrels in
the spots and they kind of know well
this is under Bluff so they will lean
towards always under bluffing uh yeah if
you if you start bluffing people in
spots where it's early early for example
where they're supposed to fold off thep
pairs uh it's probably better if you if
you Bluff in spots where they're
supposed to Hero call all the for bears
that that that sounds like a better spot
to Bluff so those were kind of some new
that you that that that just started to
apply let's how let's how think about
the opposite let's say I come to you
Mark I decide that I no longer want to
play from the comfort of my home and I
need you to turn me into a life piece
what is something that online players we
have to adjust to when they go play
Life folding folding so much more
they're not bluffing I promise you
they're not bluffing they're just not
bluffing right like if they bet I would
have so much more money today if every
time in live poker someone bet greater
than two-thirds pot on the Turner River
I just folded
everything the last I like to say this
all the time the last time in live poker
someone check ra bluffed a turn was when
George Washington Carver was President
of the United States of America I know
you guys aren't American citizens but
you can you can Google that one and
figure out when George Washington Carver
was President probably a long time
go or he was never president he was a
peanut farmer ah those my second guess
all right
nice so yeah I mean that that's that's
the biggest adjustment coming from
online is just like it doesn't matter
that you're at the top of your range if
their range is just all value right like
or like I hear this often from online
players too it's like well you know what
they don't have many combos of Bluffs
here okay yeah they don't have many
combos of
Bluffs but like or sorry they don't have
many combos of value here they're just
not repping much they don't have many
combos of value but okay maybe they only
have one combo they have literally one
combo of value but how many Bluffs do
they have well if they have zero combos
of Bluffs it doesn't matter that they're
only repping one combo of value because
their Bluff to Value rate their value to
Bluff ratio is just in infinite right so
the biggest thing coming from online is
just
like don't do the stuff you're doing
online like I think the best strategy
for live in a vacuum
is over Bluff massively over Bluff
massively overfolded
and just constantly be attacking C
ranges and if you do that you will win a
ton life like literally in one
sentence that's uh that's very solid
advice I think a lot of players who
Bluff a lot have a hard time folding a
lot because they project their own
Tendencies onto the rest of the pool
since I'm bluffing a lot they must no
they're not they're not bluffing a lot I
promise so like that's one of the things
we have to try to reel in yeah I
remember from my I recall now my life my
last life trip experience and I was like
a lot of spots I'm like okay well you
know okay wow I'm going to set this guy
up okay now he's going to massively over
Bluff and then he would say ah you got
it and then and then just not blow I'm
like what do you mean you are you check
called it went check check now you know
there's two guy you're now you have a
license to BL everything and then they
say yeah you got it and then just mck
before before I even could act I'm like
what do you mean uh uh I I still paid a
lot uh that was that I should have
listened to to to your adjustment it
didn't work out did it the pain no most
of the time it didn't but you know that
that's the thing with hero calling you
know you want to be a hero so if then
one out of six times it works you're
like ah feels so good that you're
willing to just you know
donate too curious whereas online it's
actually the opposite you should inde
fall less you know or at least you know
in a lot of spots but this is the thing
like what I noticed in my very little
life sample but as you educated us Li
small sample can actually be enough in
in live poker just the overfolded spots
where they just have all the Bluffs like
I said they they just say you got
it yeah the other thing about live which
I find interesting is you'll often see
when a live player has a bluff they
winmill it in your face why do you think
they show the
Bluff at for
th yeah because they want you to call
next time why do they want you to call
next time because they are massively
under
bluffing I don't show Bluffs because I'm
I don't want people my reputation before
my reputation live in every player pool
I've ever played in
before I started making content and
putting my entire strategy on the
internet was a tightnit
I've been playing the same style since
2016 okay because I I don't show The
Bluffs and I don't get called a lot
because I choose the sizes that they're
mostly not going to call and when they
call it's you you want them to call yeah
and the reason why players are going to
show you the bluff if you're like wow
this feels bad this guy's bluffing he
showed you the bluff because he wants
you to call next time because he's under
bluffing the guys who are bluffing all
the time aren't going to winmill the
bluff in your face that actually makes
makes a lot of
sense I'm curious um we talked or at Le
I think actually I was talking or we
talked a little bit about that you know
the the strategical part is it's easier
to teach it's harder the other skills
you already talked a little bit uh with
Adam about the mental game side what do
you think are like some common soft
skill mistakes that live poker players
make a lot when it comes down to the
live poker
grind trying to eek out every tiny
little Edge without thinking about the
long term and I've seen this a ton
because I've been doing this low sakes
Challenge and you know I have I hadn't
played $5 blind games since
2017 and I'm seeing
quite a bit where it's good action
player over there let's table change
good a big whale sits down let's seat
change it's like these guys who are
donating a ton of money they know what's
going on they're poker idiots but
they're not
idiots right and
like if these skills may not be the most
valuable skill in the world if you're
just going to play five5 your entire
life but if you have any ambition if you
want to move up the pool of donut the
pool of fish and whales gets smaller and
smaller and
smaller and if they don't like you if
you are not an enjoyable presence if
you're
not a person that they want to have at
the table you're just not going to get
to play with them so like being a person
who's willing to give up a little bit
and not take every tiny little inch
think about the long term and I think I
think that is a really underlooked skill
live you also mentioned that uh you were
looking a lot when you were when you
were coaching actually your your your
transition to coaching story was
actually very similar to mine I remember
I was I'm also a strategy fan you know I
was playing poker because I had to but I
would prefer to just do strategy all day
every day so then I was like you know I
think back then you know I heard about
you should try to find a way to get paid
doing what you like I was like well I
play poker but I like strategy so I was
like well why don't I just get a bunch
of students and I build strategies for
them they play with my strategies so I
can then do what I like which is study
and make strategies and they can do the
playing which you know I enjoy less so
that's exactly we we transitioned into
uh coaching for like a very similar
reason uh you mentioned that you were
starting to look at okay we have all
these players what small adjustment what
tweak can we make in their games that
would add like some to their win rate
what areas had you found that had the
biggest impact on their win rate the
first one we made so we were just having
guys in position our strategy still very
very similar we've made some changes
some tweaks but the strategy was in
position we're just going to range bet
every board every texture heads up no
matter what because they play poorly
against range bits and they're too wide
the strategy out of position was we're
just going to range bet every board
every texture because they play poorly
against range bets and what was
happening was our guys were in position
the Bluffs get through because when they
have a good hand from out of position
and the board is wet or the board is
dynamic they tell you they have a good
hand before the river in position when
they are in position and we're out of
position that is not the case they feel
much more comfortable trapping when they
are in position because they get the
last action and if the flush comes they
get to see you bet first they know what
to do right they feel much more
comfortable trapping with strong but
vulnerable hands in position so the
biggest change we made early on was we
went to a complete range check strategy
out of position in almost every single
spot and the reason behind that
was one
Live players massively over stab they do
what I call Monkey stabbing when you
check to them whereas like if the board
is Queen Seven
Deuce they'll just stab with pocket
sixes
why I don't know but they'll do it all
the time they just stab with any hand
that the mergie kind of stabs see
stabbing yeah they couldn't tell you why
they're stabbing if it's for Value if
it's they don't know so like they over
stabb number one number two and this is
very indicative of Live players that
does not happen online online you click
a button 33% pot 66% pot live what
happens is particularly when the board
is
dynamic when they have a good hand they
stab a little bit bigger when they have
a medium hand or a draw they stab a
little bit smaller so all of a sudden
they just start immediately telegraphing
their hand strength when you check to
them number three the third incredible
thing that happens when you check your
range out of position to Live players is
they never ever ever ever protect their
checkback
range so if they check back on the
Flop you have complete license to
Bluff with anything across turns and
rivers because they just don't have a
good hand now I say never ever ever
could they on a A7 Deuce board check
back pocket sevens 8% of the time okay
fine but the Bluffs absolutely print
when the Flop goes check check because
their range is just so weak it is so
weak because they stab so much on the
Flop like my favorite example like a wet
Dynamic board like Jack n Duce with a
flesh draw the chances that J that they
check back a jack are like less than
5% right and so when they check back the
Flop the best hand they ever have is
pocket 10 and so are they calling 2x pot
3x pot with pocket tens no never so when
we implemented this rang Tech strategy
all of a sudden win rates just went way
up and this is like the consequence of
information given away and range and
balances in general the EV of check goes
up you could even there's there are some
boards that also imposition are really
favorable for info checks uh and in
general there's just some boards that
are in general more favorable for info
checks uh because of the way that people
strength their hand right and then
basically you fall to their B and you
attack their check right because they're
they're very transparent actually a lot
of these things apply online as well
especially blind vers blind situation if
it goes check check
obvious very often you can just bet the
strength of your hand because they've
kept themselves and that kind of unlocks
you from having to play balance yourself
so from there you can just do whatever
you want it's interesting also then for
the sizing because in in
GTO uh it would then just recalibrate on
the turn a river and reach a certain
minimum defense frequency right whereas
in in practice all people don't realize
that oh I don't have any strong hands so
I should not call my weak hands right
and that's kind of what you were saying
earlier that then you you you adjusted
fund that you all you mentioned that uh
Jack n du flop man what's what's up with
that every YouTube video that c Jack n
du that was the first board that I went
through and started node loocking and
when I say nod loock I mean lock every
single turn and then every single type
of river so I would lock the turn every
single turn and then the river if the
turn is a flushing card let's lock a
blank River if the turn is a
straightening card let's lock a blank
River a four straight A flushing River a
pairing River ET so like the first lock
took me probably three weeks to do one
spot and it happened to be Jack n deuce
and that was the first one that we did
from uh single race pots out of position
so that just kind of became like this is
a pretty
good board to just indicate a lot of
these
Concepts I have a jack 85 Jack 85
rainbow if you ask me usually if if I go
to an example I always come out to Jack
85 rainbow because if you want to give
an example it's the board especially
rainbow where you're not restricted by
any I like to call like forces of equity
is exactly the board where all the hands
will just do what they want to do so if
you want to explain why hands check why
hands back small why hands that big on
that board it just does everything so I
always lean to that board it's very
interesting I I started to notice that
but every time I thought I would come up
with a random example guess what Jack
gate five there it is you know it had
some gutters but there's no straight you
know so it's there there's there's a lot
of interesting Dynamics going on
um what else did I wanted to ask you you
you you are a very big Advocate and you
explained that because Reigns betting
every board in position usually I think
except
one the ace high board yeah you see I'm
I'm low loyal loyal
Watcher because you you can you can
explain it to the
fans
one Live
players they just call way too much A6
so like if you open from the cut off or
whatever and they call on the big blind
if you look at like the hands they're
calling with well first we started
coming this idea when we were looking at
like Mass data from fish at like 50nl
but then we saw it like this supplies
live like they're just calling with like
A6 offit okay so like when the board
comes axx they just have a ton of top
pair that's number one number two the
board is A7 dece rainbow this is one of
the rare spots where they just they just
don't fast play they don't if they have
A7 or pocket sevens or pocket Deuces
they're not going to tell you that they
have that hand so the problem is is if
you choose a small size and you just
range bet on the
Flop well then what are we doing on the
turn with our air because if we bet
small again on the
turn well they've just called way too
much pre- flop with Ace King and Ace
Queen because they're Live players and
they don't three bet that stuff from the
big blind so if we go small in the turn
now the pot is small no matter what size
we go on the river they're snapping off
with Ace King or Ace
Queen and if we go big on the turn and
start over betting well yeah maybe we
can get Ace King or Ace Queen to fold on
the river if we go big bet turn Jam
River in a single raised pot 200 Big
lines deep sure but then you overb the
turn you don't give them a chance to
raise off sevens and Deuces an A7 you
just run into the top of their range
with air that's not good and so we
couldn't solve this problem and so we
started playing around with well you
know what what if we play Big better
check and the cool part about big batter
check is we end up checking 90 plus% of
the time and you know what happens when
the Flop goes check check like you were
just talking about a couple minutes ago
well they just come out on the turn and
now they tell you their hand strength
and what we've realized is if the Flop
goes check check on the a high board and
they come out and bet less than half pot
or half pot on the turn floating with
our entire range is now
profitable right because like they just
split the range on the turn and they
either bet really big when they have
strong hands or they set the Trap and go
for the occasional rare check raise but
they never bet small when they have
pocket sevens or A7 or Ace King and so
the big better check strategy started we
applied that one in position on these
Ace High boards yeah in general this is
also what I referring to earlier when
you're in position if there's board
where on turn people should do a lot of
checking a lot of slow playing these are
very sensitive to to info checking so
indeed like a high boards if you look at
their check frequency probably has to be
I don't know maybe they can bet 20% if
I'm generous but what they do is they
they just bet an Ace and they check they
check weak and I really like uh it's
very very very creative and this is
something I sometimes steal that when I
when I coach online players because
online players would have range board
because range B because it's a good
board for them and that's kind of the
criteria on but especially in the
environments of players that give away
information if of check just goes up you
have a thin hand on the turn in a in
Barrel spot for example if the guy is
going to bet half pot with his weak [ __ ]
and PO with his strong [ __ ] and check
his check his other weak [ __ ] you can
play perfect so the EV of check just
goes up through the roof so I really
like uh how you used or how you build
the strategy around an environment in
which information is transparent and
realize that oh wait we should get into
a note where they tell us what they have
so we can play Perfect like obviously
this doesn't exist in GTO because if you
check back GTO well GTO is going to is
going to play a perfect range right G
doesn't give away information so we have
to think about and that's also what we
talked about earlier kind of open up
your mind well our opponents are playing
sub optimal in which way and how can we
capitalize on that and I think this is a
good example of capitalizing on the fact
that people give away information and so
many players are like well range betting
is going to be profitable because they
just have so many hands yeah that's true
range betting is profitable but that
doesn't mean it's the most profitable
yeah right because we have to think
about what happens on turns and rivers
and I think like a lot of Live players
have trouble with delayed
gratification because if we have an air
we don't need to make them fold right
now
especially because what's going to
happen if they have air well if they're
passive they're going to check the turn
we bet and we still get them to fold
anyway and then we lose zero money
against the ax or if they're aggressive
they come out and bet half pot on the
turn we get to float with our entire
range and they either check and give up
the river or they bet small again on the
river and then we just get to raise with
all of our air and now we just got two
streets from their air so like stolting
like it's often also just uh sort of
delaying delaying a decision like if you
just range B flop you know it's you
don't have to make a decision whereas if
you check back you sort of always have
to make a decision so I feel like a lot
of the range bat in spots for the
argument while population overfalls and
ala say yeah well they also if you check
they also make a mistake and if you they
the conclusion they make mistakes
everywhere if you if you're just going
to purely go range back because that's
where the mistake is made sure you know
it's the easiest the easiest ways the
way the way I like to do it obviously
also my environment is a little bit
little bit different I will kind of
stick to quote quote GTO but will adjust
my frequencies within the appropriate
strategies uh according to my players
for example think like in general also
online you know people get data on you
maybe without you even knowing it so
it's not it's not a it's not a Anonymous
pool and people just have way more
information about your strategy and you
don't know who has that information on
your strategy so you're naturally a bit
more incentivized to not do something
too extreme because you don't know who
knows and when people know and they
counter and you don't know that then
whole your exploit is gone so that's
very different you're way more Anonymous
in a certain way in a live environment
if that makes
sense yeah online you're painting within
a canvas and you can change the colors
but the canvas is still here live you
can walk over there and paint on the
banana across the room and like live
like you know I'll run a huge Bluff for
200 big blinds and put in all the money
and okay I got called this time the guy
just had a good hand and I'll flip over
air and literally a guy at the table
will say oh he overplayed a
set they're not
adjusting they don't even know what I
had I flipped over my cards and they're
just they assume that I just overplayed
something you know what I mean like
online you got to worry about people
adjusting live
like and people like you don't
especially espec if you go play higher
stakes and if there's battles going on
you know when I'm not playing people
might be studying me for the next time
I'll be playing that doesn't really
happen in life you know so yeah it's
it's really interesting how the optimal
approach
is really different in the environment
that you're playing at and that's why
you know I said early we come to the
first thing you always ask yourself who
you're playing against or in which
environment am I playing because that
will dictate how you should think and
how you should apply uh uh a poker
concept right um you mentioned actually
a lot about information bze tells but
we're playing live any any live tells
that you teach players or that you like
to look out towards because obviously
they're transparent in terms of showing
strength with the fact that they bet
they Str strong hands or they're they're
they're they're in they're they bet big
or bet small any life tells that you
like to look at yeah one of my favorites
pre flap is I like to look at my cards
right away pre flap because again this
is offense like so many people are
worried like I'm gonna wait till me it's
my turn to look at my cards because I
don't want people to get a I don't give
a [ __ ] I want to look at my cards
because I want to be able to look at
other people so one of the one of my
favorite ones pre flop because this is
when nobody's really their guard isn't
up yet if someone takes their
cards they peel them very quickly and
then they go back
down that is extremely polarized that is
either Queen Plus or nothing so a lot of
times like I'm watching like when a
guy's peels his cards like that and then
three bets like I know he's top of range
like just Stone top of range because if
you have Aces there is this subconscious
reaction I don't want to look at these
too long because I don't want people to
know whereas if I have 109 suited do I
have hearts do I have diamonds like well
let me look at that for a second like I
want to make sure like what suit that is
is it 8 n suited or 10 so like you can
pick up a that that's I mean there's a
ton of these but that's one of my
favorite ones it's so easy to apply and
pick up that's actually a very nice one
it's kind of I I I remembered to uh yeah
when when you just look longer at the
board or at your hand you're kind of
trying to trying to see the
possibilities of it you know same the
board like oh you know maybe I can make
something but when people just see it
and they go straight away like trips and
stuff you know they're like they didn't
really need to figure out what they had
on the board they already knew what they
had you know and they were excited to
get some money in
that yeah they're looking away very
quickly when a turn card a river card
comes that like we said like that's
another big one too that's that's
strength do you in terms of when you
when you teach players that are you kind
of where is the life TS in the hierarchy
because if you overload people with
decision making points error error error
you know if we talk about from a
performance perspective they shouldn't
have too much to think about where do
they
rank it's the icing on top of the cake
icing and if you yeah if you put the
icing before eating the steak and
potatoes your your stomach's going to
have a hard
time yeah yeah that's something that you
teach as a kid right you shouldn't eat
deserved for dinner so wise advice you
know all the mothers uh explained us um
I want to jump into like some strategy
uh live poker is a well of side games
right first of all may maybe ask do you
think side games are good for the game
or bad for the game and are they good
for recreationals or bad for
recreationals good for the game and I
think they're good for recreationals
because they pull Pros into game trees
that they have not
studied interesting because I remember I
I I kind of asked a bit around when I
was playing some life I I personally
think
that proo depends kind of on the pro but
I see recreationals for example let's
say play a double double PLO bum we'll
get into I know I know I know you like
the PLO double board bump BTS but all
the type of stuff I feel like my brain
you know I just understand better uh
hand strengths and relative hand
strengths towards the fact that we're
not playing [ __ ] yellow double bump
port and there's eight people in the pot
so you know I need a pretty good hand
right uh I feel like recreationals just
make so much more mistakes when side
games enter than Pros because we already
think
strategically that was at Le my
experience or for example like standup
game or whatever game I I felt
like but I'm just projecting maybe my
own experience I just see this as a new
element I'm like okay well this is now
the new strategy that how is it
impacting the strategies and I will
adjust accordingly and a fish doesn't
doesn't know how to adjust to this new
game you are a top online player who
teaches people to crush very challenging
games that's that's very FR
with a guy playing 510 or 1020 or
whatever he's just value betting and
waiting to catch some punts man he that
like the average like live pro
like yeah I know's what my friend
Charlie wilmouth describes as a pre-
flap chart in trench coats that's what
most live Pros are right and when things
go outside their comfort zone They Don't
Know What to Do they haven't seen this
before they're just as bad as the fish
and so I think the for most like for
most of the live player pool the side
games actually balance the
the the equilibrium a little bit between
or balance the skill levels a little
more between the Rex and the pros
because the pros don't adjust well at
all so let's talk a little bit about the
double board PL bump pots for the online
listeners who've never played a hand of
Life poker often when there's a dealer
change you know and you have to pay your
time they solve it by putting all the
time in the pot and they play a double
PL bump B which means that you get four
cards instead of two obviously it's BL
and that there's BS instead of one so
would like to know common mistakes mate
the most common one betting from early
position would be a big one just like
range check from small blind big blind
under the gun like shouldn't be betting
from early position um pumping or like
bloating up pots where you just have
like the nuts on one board with no
redraw and nothing going on on the other
board I see so many players like I flop
the nut straight and they have nothing
on The Other Board and they'll just Pile
in they'll just pot it someone will
raise they'll get the money in with like
the naked nuts on one board and like the
other guy has like a set and a combo
draw it's like you are just getting
Freer rolled all the time like you were
just you're just getting scooped so
often and people don't really understand
if they haven't played a lot of PLO like
how equities work it's like yeah you can
flop the nuts and still be a dog yeah
you need we're not talking about single
like the main difference between PLO and
no limit holding right you need backup
that's all you need backup you need
backup man and like people will just
they're just like I have the nuts how
can I protect my hand that's why it's so
that's why the game is so good it comes
back to like what we talk about earlier
right Equity retention just a very
fundamental poker theorical concept
which people misapply and they
understand by protection all you can
protect you can protect against Equity
that fults but when yes when it's h that
call you have to take consideration your
Equity versus the calling races has no
long to do with protection right and
then all you do is you isolate yourself
versus the nuts and a redraw to to
another nuts and you are [ __ ] uh so
yeah over we had over investing without
any backup guys in PLO you need backup
overrating one board there's two boards
that's why it's called two board PLO so
take both boards in consideration
checking a lot for early position this
also applies to any pot basically
actually is the same what what you
mentioned right with range checking out
of position why do we see that because
we want money in the pot well if it's
likely People BET for us we don't have
to see bet it's as easy as that so when
you play a Bel one but your early
position and seven people left to act
chances are someone's goingon to do the
BET thing for you no worries right and
the other one yeah the other one is
deciding what your hand wants to
accomplish so if you have like the ab
say you have quads on one board you have
the absolute lock down nuts and you got
nothing on the other board you want one
of two things to accomplish you want one
of two things to happen you either want
everybody to call so you can just scoop
up all their money like you get half the
pot and they're just chopping up seven
ways the other board or you want
everybody to
fold and so often what I see players do
neither of those they'll just choose a
size that gets it heads up and now
you're just chopping every time you're
not making any money
like you either like you want one or the
other and you kind of have to decide
based upon what has happened in what the
action has been so far so if you so if
you feel like there's a good chance you
might people are very weak there's a
good chance you could just Bluff people
off the other board that's what you do
and if you feel like hey people are very
interested there's just a bunch of draws
out there let's just milk them let's
just b a quarter P they have four
callers and let's just chop up these
people's money yeah yeah those two
options are both great but so often
people just don't make money in them
because they're just like I have the
nuts let's pile it in and let's get it
heads up against the guy who has the
nuts on the other board well no one's
making money now any other side games
that you like let's say for example you
get to introduce a side game say hey
Mark which side game should we play
which which is the side game that you uh
that you usually like to initiate the
standup game is fun so let's let's talk
some St hey I played a fair amount of
standup game I've been owned quite a lot
this standup game I have to say my
recalibration is quite off uh in standup
game so I definitely need some some
advice could you maybe give me some
advice on how to be better at standup
game I was I was once thought I was in
this game and they said Renee you know
what your problem is said you think too
rational standup game is all about the
ego that was the advice because the guy
in Lim I remember was y viral he he he
Lim breed me with 104 offsuit and I
folded a0 offit out of position he said
like what are you doing this is an ego
game you cannot fold you see I play my
ego that's why I rer 104 you're an idiot
you fault Ace 10 what are you doing you
you cannot fault you have to play back
it's an ego game is he right is it
should I put more ego into it I like to
think of it in terms of what adjustments
can we make logistically cuz I I don't
know how to I agree it's an ego game but
I don't know how to how that helps me so
I like to think of it in terms of number
one I like to limp my range pre- flop
from upfront and the reason why is
because people are going to one use
ridiculous ISO sizes number two it's
people are going to three bet an
incredibly high amount and if we do have
like top of range like Aces or Kings or
something like that from under the gun
it's just like usually going to be the
best way to Pile in a bunch of money
because people just aren aren't going to
believe you when you limp rays and it
also allows you to see more flops when
you limp so like just limping from up
front number one that's pre- flap um if
we are from late position or like hijack
or later whatever just using tightening
up and using absolutely massive open
sizes because people aren't going to
fold so just going much more linear with
much bigger open sizes where we can just
out pip them um we got to turn down the
bluffing frequency like the bluffing
frequency has to be way
back you can just go absolutely massive
for thin value like we should be if you
have top pair all the money should be
going in somehow like the money should
just be S like top pair is equivalent to
Middle set now 200 big blinds deep um
and then like when you have like
marginal Showdown value giving people
rope and just hanging on for your life
and never folding
pretty simple but how do you adjust uh
in terms of how many players are still
standing I I kind of I what I always try
to do I try I try to take the the first
or second or the third I'm going to be
very loose and put a very big attempt in
in terms of trying to take that down
because I noticed that everyone is still
standing they're like I'll wait for the
next one so I'm going to go wild in the
first hand and the second hand and if
that doesn't work my also kind of my
future position sort of matter is where
I'm like okay there's still six people
standing I'm going to be
big blind now small blind and they don't
have position with probably three or
four people standing LS take it easy
these hands and then when I'm on the
button that's want to pile on them but
when is like listen this is my chance to
still a position I need to make
something happen you know yeah you just
have to make sure like it's one of those
like rare spots where it's like actually
pretty advantageous to not be super deep
um so you just have to make sure like
you don't punt 400
bigs so you don't have to pay a 20 big
blind penalty you know like you have to
be really cognizant of like risk reward
ratio I think your idea of like when
people just still are dialing in like
still getting used to it those first
couple hands is really really good
because it's a horrible time to try to
do it when there's three people left
yeah it's just it's you're just going to
get way way more resistance which makes
sense because if you're three left if
you think about it in terms of pups or
at least that's how I then kind of try
to calculate in my head like what are
kind of the new blinds that's kind of
how I try to get like on average what I
would have to pay and what I would save
so that kind of equals and then I would
just add that to the big blinds and then
in my head let's say we're playing 1020
I'm like okay wait with the bounties and
stuff we're actually playing 10000 now
so wait I have a 4K stack oh so that's
that's actually only 20 big blinds you
know that's start I feel like that's
translating it into I have 20 big blinds
instead of like we're playing stand up
game and trying to figure it out just
say I have 20 big blinds I'm going to
adjust for for 20 big BL play so someone
opens I Jam you know it's like it's very
feasible or like if everyone falls in
the B I can just open Jam you know
certain hands I have 20 big blinds I can
do this um that's good I like that well
what what's your opinion
on let's say I sat down I'm already
sitting down okay should I go after the
guys who's who are who are still
standing up or not because I heard some
mix opinion on it in my opinion I'm
playing with like two hands on my back
because for me on the Flop the pot is
let's say I just open the guy calls for
me the pot is let's say eight big blinds
but for the guy standing up the pot
effectively is maybe like 24 big blinds
so he could for example bet 24 big
blinds for me that's Trix pot and for
him that's pot like I'm playing with
such a huge handicap that I usually
tighten up but then I heard other
players say like yeah B but they're
going to play way to lose and you can
just you know they they're just going to
uh uh they they like to sort of go after
them because they're gonna play to lose
may maybe to lose passive what's your
opinion should we go go after them or
like I'm I'm massively staying out of
their
way it depends how bad they
are right yeah because people like again
maybe I'm I'm projecting here because
I'm like well you know you could just
now bet 3x pot and for you that's pot
for me that's but they're not going to
bet 3x pot no they're not going to bet
3x pot
and if they're going to over Bluff but
they're not going to use overb
sizes could have a pretty pretty nice
Edge and just calling them with a pretty
strong range and just giving them a lot
of rope and never fast playing your good
hands and just crawling down when you
have Showdown
value actually a good one did did did
you ever play the truck game I think
like was a bit a bit newer when I when I
went to to to Vegas this year uh in the
summer I saw it kind of going on I don't
if you ever played it where if you I
believe if you win a hand if you win
three hands in a row you get the truck
and then every hand to win everyone has
to start giving you money and then if
you have to truck him again and then
basically it piles up you ever played it
yeah we uh We've called it the Bounty
game which is a little bit bount game
makes sense yeah yeah I've played that
you liked it I like the the that game is
wild that game is wild so the the way
they play in La is they have a couple
variations but one of them is like um so
if you win a hand everybody essentially
has to give you like if you win two and
a if you have the Bounty button the
button goes around the table and if you
have the Bounty
button um everybody has to give you five
big blinds or something like
that right yeah and then if you win the
hand you keep the Bounty button and then
it doubles yeah next hand and it just
stays like that so that game is that
game is wild it's off the rails and
there's like a uh there's a 510 Bounty
game that plays in La every day and I
think that game probably plays more like
a 2040 or 2550 than like a
510 but it's uh it that that's a fun
game yeah that's actually what I thought
because for the people uh who are not
familiar with your channel you you you
were doing a challenge where you play 55
and you're trying to make 100 bucks an
hour and people say it's not really
possible I looked at couple through a
couple of your Vlogs but I mean 55 you
open to 25 it basically plays already
like a 510 game they have this poo bump
pots where believe it's uncapped I
remember when I was playing in Vegas at
least we puted a cap on it to keep it
fun uh I mean this game doesn't play
like a five5 it's way more I don't know
somewhere between five it's like seven
7505 or something it felt felt yeah but
every the thing is is like people people
say the peel up the people are like well
if you didn't have the PLO double board
bomb pots you wouldn't be able to do
this and I say okay if there weren't PLO
double board bomb pots with the PLO
double War Bomb pots we have one every
minutes they each take like 10 to 12
minutes so I'm playing like 19 hands of
hold them per hour if there weren't PL
double board bom pots I'd be playing 32
hands of no limit per hour and yeah
people punt in the double board PLO but
like I'm not good at them I just know
like a few very basic Elementary
Concepts I feel much more comfortable in
No Limit and I'd much rather play 32
hands of No Limit prow I think that
would more than make up for the double
word p bom Poots but people don't really
think that way I think the like it's
just live poker like people open to like
the other thing is like you can kind of
shape how big the game is because if you
open to 30 the first two times everybody
May fold but after that they're not
they're they don't think oh this guy has
a big hand or I should overfolded 6X
they think that's the guy who opens the
30 so if you open to 30 and people start
calling all of a sudden the rest of the
table starts opening to 30 and that's
one of the like kind of live kind of
Secret Sauce thing you could just make
the game play bigger by like just
opening bigger and then everybody else
opens bigger that's pretty pretty
interesting I I did see that they they
just put the Strat on when the game is
good that that's a f funny about life
poker playing 1020 uh or 1020 40 and
then like a wheel sits down and suddenly
the 80 is on you know that's how they do
it so is quite interesting but and then
then there for example on the 10240 they
open to 100 so it's like yeah is it
really so so much different you know
here they open 2.5x and then 55 again
they're [ __ ] opening six big blinds
so it you know you you're just playing
also pretty big with shorter like a
shorter spr which actually is
interesting because I actually find
where you find 400 big blinds deep more
fun I find it actually Less Fun uh but
like I said maybe I'm thinking too too
theoretical in terms of how much this
handcuffs me like while we're playing
super deep you know this board is you
know I'm probably have to slow it down
and wait for the river like I'm wait
maybe I'm and that kind of kills kind of
the enjoyment for me not necessarily
that I that I'm uncomfortable in terms
of that know what to do I just play too
theoretical and I just am too careful
because I take high spr and certain
wetness of boards and uh Equity
retention maybe too
serious if you think that players are
massively even like I find the magic
threshold is 300 big
lines 300 big lines if you are greater
than 300 big
blinds Pros become uncomfortable
usually no matter what game it is at 510
it's like 3K at 1020 it's 6K when you
get over that
amount they overfolded
like I don't need to worry not
necessarily talking about protection in
terms of protecting I'm not doing it for
protection per se I'm just doing it for
well it's very deep and there's a lot of
negative things that can happen on a lot
of runouts and we have a lot like
protecting like a like keeping your
range like
protected yeah I but I'm I'm I'm
protecting
more
from not isolating myself versus a
versus a strong range on wet boards when
spr is high type of stuff uh I'm not
necessarily doing it because I'm afraid
that if you know I kept my range this
guy's going to Pile in three on the big
lines you
know but I my my my 4 on Big Man game uh
very very very limited study time being
put in so I definitely think I'm I'm I'm
too careful I personally enjoy more when
the game is short and more splashy
because like I said people are more
scared but then I find it Less Fun you
know there's people are the game becomes
a bit too nitty in in my opinion
obviously you can take advantage of that
that's kind of that's my favorite type
of game because it's hard to make the
game to be fleshy I want the game to be
I want people to be
scared because then when people are
scared that's when they're at their most
predictable that's and in a splashy game
you got to make a hand and I've had
almost all of my biggest losses have
come in splashy games when I'm sitting
deep in a game where everybody's 300 400
big lines deep I'm just not going to
lose that often because the red line is
just going to go through the
roof Adam we played a lot we talked a
lot about uh side games and a lot of
Chaos in the game how do you sort of
stay calm and confident when you're
being pulled into a lot of games a lot
of spots that you're not really prepared
for how do you prepare basically for the
chaos
good question I think it comes down to
being okay with uncertainty as Mark was
mentioning this kind of making mistakes
we all make them in these environments
it's that your threshold for making
mistakes just needs to be a lot wider
you just like everyone's messing up
everywhere be okay with that and from a
g to rigid people they're going to
struggle with that because they're like
[ __ ] I don't know what to do where you
got to get almost like enjoy the chaos
enjoy being in uncertainty and develop a
level of confidence in yourself to
navigate that this is what I think Mark
show for this conversation his ability
to kind of navigate those extremes of
playing a exploitive style and yeah
being okay with the consequences of not
playing perfect and being okay with that
not having your identity linked to it
and yeah I think it's definitely uh in
these environments bomb pots and stuff
you're going to have to survive the
chaos um some people will thrive in it
but also not be too Harding yourself
when you're the the guy messing up
because you have never studied that spot
in your life so it's okay all right I
want to do a little bit of reflecting
with you mark so we've covered a lot of
your journey we've covered a lot of the
where you're at right now think it be a
good time to kind of look back on some
lessons and things that have contributed
to your success so looking back on your
poer journey what would you say is the
most important lesson that poker has
taught
you
patience and I I I used to say I was a
very impatient person I don't like
saying I don't like saying I'm ex I try
not to say like I'm X type of person
anymore because like that then you're
just like reinforcing that thing and
then you can never break out of that
thing but I think like poker has taught
me a ton of
patience because you can do the right
thing every day and still have the wrong
results so it's also taught me how
important distancing process from
results is and how important trusting a
certain process is and that if you
continually put in the work the result
will eventually come it's it's just not
going to come today necessarily or even
next month or in 6 months but it's going
to come eventually and that has been so
helpful in other facets of life for me
and just being able to trust that if I
do the right thing and build good habits
then good things will come I just have
to
wait Le how do you build more trust in
the process let say we've got two
extremes we've got we want the results
or we want to going to going to lean
into to the actions we taken that lead
those results how have you built
confidence in your processes that have
allowed you to be patient because I
think patience doesn't always rely on it
but it definitely helps to U have
confidence in your approaches to an
outcome then you can like sit back and
go right over the long term it's going
to be okay I think a lot of people may
struggle because maybe they they don't
trust the process so how have you been
able to develop a process that you trust
we talked about it earlier but I think
it's just having trust in that data over
a b example in that so I I think it it
could be hard for someone at the start
who doesn't have that data and the
second guessing could be incessant it
could
be until you have the data you you don't
know you're going to have the right
process so I think you just you just
have to put in the hours but the good
thing about live poker in particular is
the edges are so
big you may not be able to figure out
exactly what your win rate is that's
going to be impossible over a a small
sample but you can figure out if you're
a big winner or a big loser you can make
those conclusions very quickly and if
you're winning 14 big blinds per hour
even over like a 200h hour sample the
chances that you're a losing player is
very very very small right the the
inverse is also true like if you're
losing 14 big blinds per hour or 200
samples so like you don't need that big
of a sample live to be able to determine
if the process is really good or or
really bad and I guess for online you
have a lot more data to be able to
support it and you get a much bigger
hand sample much more quickly
so I think you just need to have a
little bit of patience at the beginning
in order to formulate the process as
well yeah and using data is like a a
metric which you can't argue with as
much your feelings obviously and your
own subjective interpretations are very
malleable but over time data is like
right what's the data showing me and
yeah I think as well with patience
there's not liit of patience of waiting
of like being okay with doing the work
and continuing but I think also built
into patience needs to be an obsession
with doing more getting better and
realizing wait a second maybe maybe this
approach I'm taking isn't optimal and I
can do better I think if we can combine
a patient attitude with also a striving
to improve get better over time it's
unreasonable not for that not to work if
I say over 5 years you're going to apply
yourself and get better through that
process every day it's unreasonable for
you not to be successful over that
Journey maybe you're the guy who's the
1% outlier no. no no not 1% outlier on a
graph but chances are you're going to
get success to some degree it might may
may or may not be what you anticipated
but I think it's definitely uh a good
lesson I think think poker will teach
you patience when you're trying to rush
a lot of players like have a time frame
of I'm gonna be playing high stakes by
2026 it's like they just crushing micro
Stakes at the moment it's like pocket is
going to hit you with a reminder it's
not your time kind of scale and you're
going to have to uh yeah just accept
that results will come in the wrong time
all right next reflecting question other
than patience what has been your
greatest contributor to your
success being hard-headed and learning
not to give up I think
good
poker's poker's really hard like we've
talked about
[Music]
and it's really easy to quit when things
don't go your way it's really easy
[Music]
to say hey I'm not going to make any
changes because the deck is just against
me today or this just not my day and
it's just really easy to fall into bad
habits bad patterns bad routines and
it's really easy to just stay stagnant
and never get better
and poker for me has given me
that I want to always continually climb
the mountain because in poker if you are
not getting better your win rate is
going down because the player pool is
getting better every year and so I have
this like incessant drive that if I'm
not
improving I'm making less money you have
to be on the treadmill just to stay in
the same place so if you want to move
forward you really have to work because
everybody's getting slightly better
every year with more information so I
think that's that's another thing that
poker has given me is it's just it's
helped instill kind of a a pretty good
work ethic coming from someone who used
to have a very very poor work
ethic it's a tough pill of swallow as
well that poker is tough it is hard you
need to run very fast on that treadmill
to sometimes just being in the same
place and yeah I think a lot of players
it will filter them out in terms of
maybe not willing to do the work maybe
not able to do the the commits
themselves and yeah I think for you You'
mentioned a lot of kind of challenges
that players face in terms of the ego
you mentioned yourself being a bit of a
victim mindset uh being close-minded
rather than open-minded these are things
that if you hold on to them poker will
just destroy you like you will not get
to the the goals without overcoming them
the good news is it's all internal work
that you can learn to let go of the ego
you can learn to shift mindset from a
victim mindset to a more proactive
mindset but it does take work and I
think this is the it kind of reminds me
if you talk about the analogy of leading
somebody to the end of the cliff you
can't make them jump it's like doing the
in work it's like you can't make them do
this this kind of work but if you're
willing to if you're willing to uh
become more open-minded to meet your
kind of frailties head on you can have
amazing success to I think it's it's
been a a good conversation that's
covered that from many angles all right
what's the one thing that poker has
taught you that you didn't expect so you
imtion patience is being a great lesson
but in terms of things you haven't
expected on your poker Journey anything
that stands
out sometimes you just can't control
things
and I've always been a little bit of a
control
freak I want to be able to feel that my
actions have a
direct output and in poker it doesn't
work that way and I've had had
[Music]
to let go of that a little and just
realize that there are so many things
outside poker that are out of my
control you can do the best what you
think is the best
choice for a relationship would you
think is the best choice for a career
and sometimes with all the information
you have in the moment you did make the
best choice but that doesn't mean the
result is going be what you want and
poker has really really really it has a
way of hitting you on the head with that
and teaching you that very
quickly so how do you how have you
learned to accept the things you don't
control because that is like a bit of a
challenge for players where they know
lot is out of their control they know
the actions and results don't correlate
but it doesn't make it any easier
especially when they're going through
months maybe years of underperforming
relative to the expectations so for you
have you learn to uh be more acceptant
of things you don't control
mushrooms explain uh
that just
realizing how small I am and how little
everything matters in the big picture
and being able to zoom out and see
myself as this like tiny little molecule
of sand in a universe really helped me
start to come to grips with that not
having control doesn't matter and it's
even silly to
put importance on me having control when
I realize that how small I am and how
little everything I have ever done or
will do will
matter so powerful and yeah even though
we went from the mushrooms angle the way
you describe that like it's very much a
perspective skill it's understanding
like the bigger picture of we can go
super big in terms of the the cosmos and
how the galaxies are all working but on
our level it's like everything is quite
insignificant in terms of daily actions
our years and trying to uh realign that
reality because it is the reality you're
a little ants walking along the soil and
some planet's been in the Orit orbit
nobody cares nobody's going to care when
you're here when you're gone hard pillar
swallow as well but it's one of those
perspective skills you're like all right
these things that I'm complaining about
or CR his internal H frustration around
OB that's significant and often that
allows you to get back in sh with
reality which is the current moments
experiencing it doing your best and
being okay with it see I think the the
skillet perspective whether you get that
through mushrooms you get there through
sism or any sort of practical
application of learn to zoom out from
your situation to see the bigger picture
I think is is super valuable um you
mentioned in the questionnaire that you
need talent in order to succeed and I'm
curious to know how this fits in for you
so yeah why do you feel like that is
true that's you need talent to succeed
especially in
po I mean
it's there's a bar right I like to think
about like music like you don't
necessarily need to be able to
sing but if you're going to rap you need
to have a relatively you need to have
you need to have rhythm
Cadence if you just don't have that in
if you have zero of that innate ability
if you can't even hear pitch well you
know what maybe being a singer is just
not going to be for you it's the same
thing in poker
like if you can't rationally carry a
thread from Street to Street no matter
how much you practice like if you get to
the turn you opened on the button and
the guy calls in the big blind and now
you get to the turn and you're like well
he check ra me I guess he has Aces you
just forget what happened pre flop like
some people just can never get over that
hump of being able to rationally carry a
thread their brains just don't work in
that way and that doesn't mean they're a
dummy it just means it doesn't work in a
way that works in poker and if you don't
have that kind of innate ability I feel
like there's just no amount of work in
the world that's going to turn you into
a top tier poker
player how high is that ball that you
need to to have in order to be able to
have some success for online it's you
got to be able to jump at least a few
feet in the air you got to probably be
able to at least touch the rim on a 10-
foot basketball hoop for online like if
or for live if you can just lift your
legs One Foot In Front of the other
you'll probably be okay uh but you need
to be able to walk you can't be in a
wheelchair yeah I think it's very true
for almost anything there's a a level
you need to be at originally or the kind
of beas line before you can actually
have success in it and if you're not at
that level like you you're just not
going to be able to to piece things
together just not cut out for that kind
of thing um obviously everyone listen to
this conversation today hopefully the
poker players are spirm players you've
passed the test you're on the at least
the can put one foot in front of the
other and fall over uh but yeah I think
it is good to acknowledge that you do
need some elements I think you mentioned
earlier in the conversation about your
grandma and you thought you could teach
her originally now you're like wait a
second maybe she doesn't pass the some
sort of the reason test that would be
needed um and also I think the Curiosity
as well I think our curiosity goes deep
into certain things so for you for
example music myself like I love music
but I've never went deep into music and
I can't imagine going deep into learning
about music and on like a really high
level because my curiosity isn't there
so I could try and fake it I could try
it to create incentives I could try to
make myself sit down and learn it but
it's not coming from a place of I want
to learn it I'm curious about it so I'm
always going to come unstuck there so
let's say someone has that that talent I
think it also links with IQ I think IQ
Curr with success to a certain point to
a certain threshold then above that
doesn't more let's say you've got
talents um how do you sort of cultivate
that talents in the right
way number
one learn how to range people and how to
do it very very quickly
practice with a shot clock
on going from pre- flop to flop to turn
to River at first don't give yourself
any timer just see if you can take a
hand what is his range on the river
after all these actions going Street to
Street and
then add time add a minute for each
Street and then do it add 15 seconds for
each Street and practice being so good
what is their range I their range
because when I'm playing now I'm not
asking myself what is their range it's
already in there I'm
thinking what happens if I do this what
happens if I do that because the range
is already innate right so first step is
getting very good at ranging step number
two I would say is
reducing some of the brain power used to
make simple decisions and for that you
can call it defaults you can call it
kind of like heris that you're going to
use for example some of the ristics like
we I talked about that I use I just
range bet in position for a small size I
check my range out of position and just
having some of these simple defaults
whatever they are allows you to kind of
not have decision fatigue because you've
come to a good enough decision early on
in the hand where now you're saving your
brain power to make those big important
decisions on later streets number three
would be developing a repeatable thought
process or just fancy words
for do you ask the right questions in
hands and for everybody this may be
different for me the questions I ask
essentially is what is their range are
they capped what happens if so what
happens if I bet big what happens if I
bet small what happens if I check right
and then on Rivers I ask the inverse
question what would I do with the
inverse and I ask those questions I
don't consciously ask what would I do no
it's just like range is this
right they're capped what would I if I
was bluffing I would do that so like
having that repeatable list of
questions just allows you to come to the
right decisions so so so much quicker so
I don't know how many steps I just named
but those would be the first
few what I like about what you did there
was you did it in a kind of step-by-step
order where where there was a clear
hierarchy of what came first so Larn to
range people was the first one then
there was the reducing kind of brain
activity by having defaults and then on
top of that there was the kind of th
process you make and I think the
repeated th patterns and I think
understanding that we need to create
baselines before we can do the
complicated stuff is so important if you
miss steps that you haven't let to
arrange people you haven't got some
defaults how to play a strategy don't
worry about like asking the right
questions because you're going to mess
up from the off so understand how to
build your strategy from that kind of
layer by layer approach and this kind of
goes alongside kind of simplified versus
complex strategies as well like where
they fit when you should simplify when
not if you're if you haven't learned to
simplify you're going to get lost in
complexity so like putting the icing on
the cake which you haven't even started
making the cake yet and you're like okay
the ic's just on the floor but yeah
really like how you went through a very
structured way of thinking about that to
yeah I'm sure the audience listening
will be able to take notes on that and
think about them themselves of where
they maybe need to do more work on one
of those three steps and yeah I think it
you link it together really nicely all
right final question from
what is your definition of success and
how has that changed over the
years you know I used to think once I
got to like a certain once I made a
certain amount of money that I would
retire that I'd be done like um I did it
but one of the things I've realized is
that the higher you climb the mountain
whether it's in poker whether it's in
business whether it's just earning money
whether it's in any type of activity
where you're just trying to get better
or keep score
being able to continually do that thing
is Success if you're just able to wake
up and keep doing it the next
day that's success and if you're able to
work on that things so you can
continually get better that's really all
you can ask for and like all the extr
extrinsic
extrinsic is that the right word
extrinsic ex extrinsic yes all of those
Rewards will
follow if you were just obsessed with
the process of continually doing the
thing and getting better so for me like
I've realized at this point I'm probably
never going to retire I'm always going
to be working on something I'm always
going to be attempting to climb some
Mountain whether it's poker whether it's
something else and for me there is no
end point to success it's just
continual great answer probably one of
the best answers we've had to that
question I was trying to think like how
much
other things factor into this so let's
say playing the game is what success
looks like in terms of being in the game
and enjoying the process to enjoy the
process how much relies on having goals
being able to progress with it be able
to grow improve because I know for
myself if I'm playing games or I'm doing
something there has to be an element of
seeing progress or being able to
progress in that Sphere for me to
continue to enjoy it for you in terms of
you enjoying poker you enjoying St still
being in the game how much is reliance
on having external sort of things to
push towards or some sort of growth and
progression built into that yeah the
external things are just to keep score
and now that I'm more on the business
side like the money the revenue the
business makes is just a way to keep
score it's just to know that the
business is doing better this year than
it did last year it's not really
about how much it put in my bank account
it's about knowing that I am progressing
I'm getting better at this I am
providing more value to more people I'm
helping like the business will make more
money if more people gain value from the
service I am providing so like to me
like yeah the game has to keep
progressing because if you don't
progress you're just kind of walking on
a treadmill in perpetuity and that is
why I started feeling stagnation with
poker because I couldn't move forward I
couldn't get off the treadmill I was
just at the very front of the treadmill
clamping my feet against the board
and I think if you ever feel like that
the
[Music]
game you've won the game then you need
to play a different game
[Music]
yes love that yeah I think as well it's
also the goal itself is like the the
journey like an external journey and as
you said it's the way of keeping score
so to speak but the real journey is like
the internal Journey like the growth of
who you need to become to climb the
mountain so we set the mountain we start
climbing it going yes the view at the
top is going to be amazing and really
it's like who you need to be to be the
guy who climbs the mountain is all of it
when you at the top you're like I'm the
badass who climbed that mountain go M
and the view itself gets fed away and
then you got go next Mountain so yeah I
think just understand that kind of
process and yeah I really really
resonate with that as well like playing
the game it also applies The Game of
Life if you're enjoying playing the game
of Life whatever that involves for you
you're winning that is Success like what
what else is there like what other the
cherry on top of the Ki can we give you
to uh to feel better when that is the
the ultimate metric so yeah really
really good I love that answer Rene for
you how do you relate
to Mark's answer in terms of the sex of
Life playing the game and yeah what's
your thoughts on that I would add on top
of that uh because you have people you
know who go project to project trying to
get something out of it usually when the
outcomes so I would add on top of
that the emotions that you experience on
a daily basis while you're on that grind
they have to be pleasant right because
in the end the emotions that you
experience daily they kind of form the
experience of your life so if you're
constantly experiencing emotions of lack
and frustration because you want to get
to a certain goal because you feel like
it's it will you know it satisfies you
because that only when you reach that
goal you feel like you're good enough
you know you're in a constant state of
frustration until the goal is reached
and then you feel good for a day and
then you go on to the next project not
very not very uh uh not really the
definition of success so like I agree
with all of it I just add on top of that
uh yeah that try to experience Pleasant
emotions uh during that process and
therefore also when you when you
experience Pleasant the most during
process will also make you able to play
the game in the long term which was part
of the definition of success that Mark
gave we talk about playing games in the
long term how do the future look for for
Mark maybe also future how how do you
think about the future of Poker and how
do you see Mark in the
future I think probably less and less
poker uh I've become fascinated with the
business side because it's a whole
different game game and I'm just
enjoying learning new skills constantly
and I see myself I I I I'm very much
enjoying that game and feeling like a
novice in learning new things every day
every week every month and so I've kind
of jumped more into that side while
gethin has done much more of the the
poker and the coaching side so I think
that's probably a lot more of that in my
future uh I'm going to be a a dad next
month first time Dad so that will be uh
that will be a very big change and I
think just I've been so focused
on my own Journey poker my career Etc
it'll be nice to take a step back and
focus on somebody else and how I can
help them um so yeah I think that's
that's where I'll be at big picture in
the
future you've uh your bread has really
been taking off over the last uh few
months we talk about your your YouTube
channel great growth uh great content
what are your biggest lessons that you
learned so far around building a
brand H that's a good
one giving away the secrets is
good I was so terrified to like oh we
spent three years building all this
stuff if I give out some of this stuff
on YouTube how stupid is that right I'm
just going to give away for free like
all the sauce that we spent three years
building nah that is that's ridiculous
but once I started doing that everything
took off everything completely changed
for us
because I was just actually giving away
value and by giving away value for free
if your free
content is
garbage everybody who watches the free
content is going to assume that the paid
stuff is
garbage and so our brand really took off
when I resolved I'm like you know what I
want to make the free stuff as good as
the paid stuff now the paid stuff it's
you know it's much more personal it's a
much more hands-on experience but I'm
not holding anything back in the free
content
because that's going to be people's
first impression of the brand and I want
people's first impression of the brand
to be like holy [ __ ] this stuff is good
because what's the alternative to that
it's bad I'm never going to pay for this
I don't like this I'm never going to
watch another video so for me like that
was the biggest lesson I had to learn
and that changed everything for our our
our brand in our
content great answer I couldn't agree
more what would you like the main
takeaway for our audience to be that we
from the conversation that we had
today I don't know this was a great
conversation this is the this is the
best podcast interview I've ever done by
far you guys are you guys are amazing
thank you very
much I don't
know I don't have a big picture one I've
enjoyed this conversation though this is
I think the first time I've ever had a
three and a half hour conversation where
I was like yes more it's good and where
and where you R trying to get in our
pants true uh
yes I'm sure somewhere throughout your
life you've been basically talking to a
woman for three and a half hours you
know because you expected a certain
outcome not just to REM listen but it's
fun man we all like poker we're
interested in the game so it's very easy
to ramble for three and a half hours we
found
yes it was good it was very enjoyable
thank you guys I really do appreciate it
wow what a great podcast mark thank you
for coming on definitely interesting to
have kind of a new new type of
perspective right obviously we have a
lot of online guys on especially lately
we've been talking a lot of the online
Grinders and I think Mark definitely
offered a completely different
perspective so thanks for for giving
this perspective to us Adam any main
takeaways of today's
conversation yeah a very different
conversation to a lot of the guests
which was very good I like that he said
he's very clear with what he was
recommending and all his answers were
very concise and he generally gave very
good action items as well one thing he
said to have success in light pocker two
things you need one work ethic and two
lack of ego as we got into lack of ego
it was generally breaking down to open
minding this and ability to learn
ability to take on new ideas ability to
be wrong and to learn from mistakes all
came together in terms of um yeah not
being this kind of stubborn person who's
trying to be right but trying to
understand how to play the game at a
higher level H then you mentioned two of
the obstacles that players face which
were fear and greed and fear came up in
terms of not being able to deal with
make mistakes risk aversion I think he
he put summarized it as avoiding taking
risks and how players have to learn to
overcome that to to move forward and
then greed he was talking the Greed from
the example of basically trying to win
fast playing good hands trying to win
money too quickly and how that's
basically offly counterintuitive or goes
against your overarching theme of trying
to make the most pussyy decision so kind
of talk about the what you need is
trades but also what some the obstacles
that players face and how we have to try
and navigate those then he mentioned
like the the top 1% habit you mentioned
99% of players suck live one doing a
good job and those guys have curiosity
and as I kind of proved on curiosity he
was kind of of the camp of it's quite
hard to uh um hack your way into that or
manipulate it it kind of comes naturally
you gravitate towards the things you're
curious about if PO is not the thing
you're curious about you need to start
looking um maybe other avenues but ger
you want to spark that Curiosity as much
as possible to get yourself to uh to
think outside the box to learn to be
that creative Problem Solver especially
in his world where it's all about
exploits thinking about what big
Jeremy's doing you've got to have that
curious mind to uh to really think of
the exploits and then I really like to
the end talk about like the lesson that
you learned from poker and one that he
said was patience and being patient I
think this is a a real big one in terms
of realizing you going to go through
patches of your career where you feel
like you're just not on track you feel
like you're not achieving your goals for
him it was 2018 he had 600 plus hours
break even live I can only imagine what
that feels like in terms of in the live
environment where the wind rates are
super high and he pushed through that
and was patient enough to get to the
side of that so whatever it means to you
tapping into your the process over the
results trying to enjoy your day-to-day
enjoy the process of getting better at
learning and then being patient that
result at some points will take care of
themsel if you're committed so yeah they
were the main ones designs loads of
other things I wrote but I I'll keep it
for that one how about yourself Ren what
are the main takeways for you I wrote on
a couple things as well the environment
and the villain they dictate how you
want to think about the game so poker on
a mechanics level right and the
theoretical level it all works the same
but the actual strategy that you put out
at the tables and the thought process
that you want to go to the things that
you take in consideration are very
environment and villain dependent right
we talked a lot throughout this SP this
podcast for example that in live poker
people are just way more transparent
they give away way more information
therefore altering your strategy and
capitalizing on this information is way
more important people also are less good
at uh exploiting you so playing a more
exploitive style will be way more
profitable I also mentioned that I think
in online poker people do this wrong
very often they think about a lot of
things throughout the hand but they
forgot about the most important thing in
the beginning that was who am I playing
against right and that's also Big Jeremy
again came up you awesome poor Big
Jeremy man we've mentioned Big Jeremy
quite a lot poor guy uh but yeah if
you're playing against Big Jeremy you
know your blockers unblockers or your
minimum defense frequency obviously it
doesn't really matter when way you're up
against lius maybe you should take that
in consideration so it's that's always
where you should start the
decision-making process who am I playing
against because that will determine what
is relevant the terms to uh think about
he mentioned lot you mentioned curiosity
he he mentioned a lot node loocking and
then he said um what's possible right
there was also an overall kind of
mindset like how much could we actually
win what is the what is actually
possible right um that I felt was very
valuable as well um there's of
decision-making process he mentioned a
lot of what's the range kind of Charlie
Carrol shout out Charlie Carol says
what's the range and what to do about it
so this is very much in line he said
what's the range uh and he men lot
simplify common decisions right to kind
of save brain fatigue so you can make
better decisions later on which we've
heard a bit in other podcast as well I
remember the one with uh Luca bra where
where he said right well simplify
because from that simplify Baseline and
know I can think creative for example
and it all came down to asking yourself
the right questions because the right
questions they steer your mind in
thinking about the right things
basically the question that you give
your mind mind that's what he's going to
think about so if you think about if you
give the question well who we have good
blockers well your mind's going to think
well let me uh let me see do I have good
blockers right whereas he had way way
different questions that he would ask
his brain that in his experience would
lead to this decisions or lead to
processing information that actually
leads to a better decision uh he
mentioned the what happens if which
basically is action consequence so if I
do this then what does he do and He also
mentioned uh what would I do with the
inverse right that was I think very good
to kind of hold your a bias accountable
uh things that I for example always like
to ask myself is where should my value
come from and what do I like to achieve
or what do I want to achieve with my
hand these are for example two very
basic decision-making process questions
that I have when going through a hand
all right that was it I want to thank
everyone for tuning in again another a
great podcast I want to thank Mark again
