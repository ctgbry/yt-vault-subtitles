[00:00]
I was trying to think my way into
playing good poker and now I'm just like
attentive I'm just trying to be present
and enjoy the game and not take it too
seriously take it with a sense of
humor maybe that takes me back to

[00:15]
humor maybe that takes me back to
actually when we had um the old bit B
and I had um I had I had kind of a
decision to make like I had a had a
bunch of people around me at the time um
who wanted to form this kind of a study

[00:31]
who wanted to form this kind of a study
study group or like yeah this kind of
study group and I actually decided that
I'm not going to to join I was going to
join at first but then I realized
that there was actually more negatives
to joining than positives and it was

[00:47]
to joining than positives and it was
revolved around a certain mindset and
maybe a little bit of tox tox how you
say toxicity as well and um yeah I
turned it down and then after that

[01:00]
turned it down and then after that
um I don't know I I ran insanely well
online and uh got all the results in the
well but I also kind of found a lot of
freedom I I felt like I was able to play
with kind of like a weight lifted lifted
off my shoulders like I still had um

[01:15]
off my shoulders like I still had um
Elmer and pads who I've always kind of
been been around but there was some guys
who I just left behind at this point and
uh yeah it lifted my game to a
completely new level and and it's it's
also I think very important and I I've

[01:31]
also I think very important and I I've
read quite a few spiritual books and
just the kind of energy that you bring
and you know the positivity and just the
M the mindset and I feel like with El R
and pads it's very matched but but with
some of this other part of the group it

[01:45]
some of this other part of the group it
really wasn't there and I have nothing
like bad to say about them as uh people
or anything like this it's just
sometimes it just doesn't work out you
don't really click with someone on that
level and and you don't necessarily want
to be speaking to these people um

[02:00]
to be speaking to these people um
every day if you don't feel that kind of
you know deeper
connection and uh yeah I think that's
kind of what made me play on a on a way
better level that I ever thought that I
could have ever reached um playing poker

[02:15]
could have ever reached um playing poker
and that's kind of when things
skyrocketed in in a good way when you
say that you don't really make click do
you mean like you just didn't really
feel a good vibe with the group or was
it mainly like their approach to Poker
like I think I think you kind of sideway
it from the solvers to this conversation
was that like they were way more like

[02:32]
was that like they were way more like
GTO oriented followed the solver and you
felt that maybe like your curiosity or
maybe your creativity with how you
approach poker was kind of being
threatened yeah it was a bit of both it
was a lot of um I I kind of see poker as

[02:49]
was a lot of um I I kind of see poker as
like an odd form you know you kind of
get to express yourself and and you uh
you you get to try things out sometimes
they work sometimes they don't and I'm

[03:00]
they work sometimes they don't and I'm
the type of guy who has learned through
a lot of experience and and books to not
be very judgmental towards myself if I
if I make mistakes like I'll I'll
acknowledge you know honestly and
objectively that it's a mistake but I'm
happy to make a mistake if I can learn

[03:15]
happy to make a mistake if I can learn
something from it so I'm happy to take
the risk in trying something new and
then maybe it being a really good thing
um but but not then afterwards judging
myself and I think in this group I kind
of lost my creativity a little a little

[03:30]
of lost my creativity a little a little
bit and I kind of lost that love and
passion for the game so I was kind of
just you know maybe a little bit like
scared to to play in a way like you just
wanted to play in a certain way so this
group was you know kind of happy with
the decisions that you were making so
you kind of lost a PO of yourself and

[03:47]
you kind of lost a PO of yourself and
and uh yeah I found that was hugely
detrimental to my game and just
well-being and everything uh related to
the game so so it was kind of like you
had to play in the way that the whole

[04:00]
had to play in the way that the whole
group agreed to play or
something yeah kind kind of you know it
was just you know frown upon if if you
would take certain lines that the solo
wouldn't basically agree with so it was

[04:15]
wouldn't basically agree with so it was
kind of like a very close-minded
approach and not really seeing the
bigger picture and uh yeah that just
wasn't something for me and uh happy
that I was able to go on my own path and
and still remain with uh Elmer and P
obviously have very open and strong

[04:32]
obviously have very open and strong
Minds in the game uh you mentioned that
you learn a lot from your mistakes do
any big mistakes stand out that you
maybe repeatedly made that in the end
turned out to be great

[04:46]
turned out to be great
lessons um big mistakes that I've made
that stood
out I'm trying to think of uh there
there's so many different hands that
come to mind where I've made like big
blund or whatever and then learn a lot

[05:00]
blund or whatever and then learn a lot
from it but
um I I I guess like the the like I can't
really recall any single mistake but I
think I would I would say that I've
changed my approach to how I play and
how I think about the game I think

[05:16]
how I think about the game I think
beforehand I was I was going into my
sessions I was trying to think my way
into playing good poker and you know
trying too hard and and overthinking in
in like pretty much every spot and you

[05:30]
in like pretty much every spot and you
know trying to maybe memorize some chart
or whatever else and now I'm just like
I'm just trying to be attentive I'm just
trying to be present and enjoy the game
and not take it too seriously take it
with a sense of humor so I think I don't

[05:46]
with a sense of humor so I think I don't
really recall any any like there isn't
really any huge mistake that that stands
out in itself but it's just like the
whole approach has completely changed to
how I view the game View and play the
game um basically in in the mindset

[06:00]
game um basically in in the mindset
which which you were in in the past that
kind of led to certain mistake and you
kind of figured out I could maybe in the
beginning you tried that right oh I
shouldn't do this anymore I shouldn't do
that sounds very like I'm sharing my own
experience here as well where at some
point you realize wait all these

[06:15]
point you realize wait all these
mistakes that I'm making they all come
from I'm approaching the game in the
wrong mindset I'm in the wrong state of
mind and therefore I make this approach
so when you then try to solve all these
mistakes by saying I shouldn't do this I
should do that you you're trying to
solve the same problem

[06:30]
solve the same problem
with kind of the same mindset sometimes
you need a different approach did
anything did you do anything consciously
different as well with how you would go
into a session for example like a sort
of let's call it let's call it it like a
pression routine did you change anything
there yeah I mean in in the past if I'd

[06:46]
there yeah I mean in in the past if I'd
make like a big scoop 10K 25k Final
Table and there would be like a million
first or whatever I would be I would be
kind of consciously or unconsciously
worrying about I have to play these
spots ride there's going to be a huge

[07:00]
spots ride there's going to be a huge
audience watching and all my friends and
you know even family and I want to be
nailing every ICM spot blah blah and and
I would look through like solvas and and
look at you know what the outputs would
be and then on the final table you end

[07:15]
be and then on the final table you end
up you would end up actually
overthinking a lot of the spots and
playing way way worse and nowadays what
I'll do is I'll just I'll just leave it
like I'll make the final table and I'll
trust myself 100% And then when when I
go into the final um like I'll take an

[07:32]
go into the final um like I'll take an
hour walk before I play the final
nothing else so I'll go play a paddle
game maybe with some friends and I I
won't really think too much about the
game and I think that approach has made
me play so much better on these finals

[07:46]
me play so much better on these finals
like just so so so much better and I I I
also at some point when I when I stopped
approaching the game this way I kind of
lost the fear of making a mistake so if
I'd make some kind of mistake on the
final table like you know some hand that

[08:00]
final table like you know some hand that
I cooled wasn't a cool I was just like
oh that's that's life you know you you
live and you learn and and uh it's not
too serious so uh I I think that that
was a huge one for me like there's a
couple of recent final tables where I
had exactly that approach and I just

[08:16]
had exactly that approach and I just
felt so comfortable and so calm and
collected and had like really good reads
and just just just felt like I really
wanted to be there and sometimes in the
past I didn't necessarily feel like I
wanted to be there I feel like I kind of

[08:30]
wanted to be there I feel like I kind of
wanted to just get it over with kind of
thing cuz it wasn't I wasn't really
enjoying the experience because of all
the pressure that I kind of um
unconsciously put on myself you know
