because when it comes to Poker related
stuff I'm just trying to be the least
amount of human that I can be in that
kind of situation and every time I kind
of have some sort of emotional feeling
or like some sort of emotion that would
trick an action

[00:16]
trick an action
like I I kind of built this
some sort of trigger in my head where I
immediately ask myself whether this is
like when I have an emotion I
immediately ask myself if this emotional
triggered because of that or that and

[00:30]
triggered because of that or that and
does it make sense so like I immediately
in the spot I would think about is this
no rational do I have I really work this
out or do it just you know make this
decision based out of emotions
