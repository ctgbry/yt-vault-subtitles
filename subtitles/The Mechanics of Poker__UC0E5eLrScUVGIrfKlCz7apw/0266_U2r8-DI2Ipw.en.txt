suspecting [laughter] that you might

[01:56]
suspecting [laughter] that you might

[01:56]
suspecting [laughter] that you might
have raised it. Like is that what

[01:59]
have raised it. Like is that what

Did well do we get do we get deep in the

[02:03]
Did well do we get do we get deep in the

Did well do we get do we get deep in the
weeds? Okay. No, we didn't. [laughter]

[02:04]
weeds? Okay. No, we didn't. [laughter]

[02:04]
weeds? Okay. No, we didn't. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; So, but actually I want to maybe add

[02:06]
&gt;&gt; So, but actually I want to maybe add

[02:06]
&gt;&gt; So, but actually I want to maybe add
some point. I feel like if this was like

[02:08]
some point. I feel like if this was like

[02:08]
some point. I feel like if this was like
for example big plan button, I'm way

[02:10]
for example big plan button, I'm way

[02:10]
for example big plan button, I'm way
less happy because then you know like a

[02:12]
less happy because then you know like a

[02:12]
less happy because then you know like a
primary bluff for example would be queen

[02:14]
primary bluff for example would be queen

[02:14]
primary bluff for example would be queen
10 off. But I feel like since we play

[02:16]
10 off. But I feel like since we play

[02:16]
10 off. But I feel like since we play
blind versus blind, the queen 10 off is

[02:18]
blind versus blind, the queen 10 off is

[02:18]
blind versus blind, the queen 10 off is
not really in there. So the bluffs are

[02:19]
not really in there. So the bluffs are

[02:19]
not really in there. So the bluffs are
going to be more like 48 offuit or 34

[02:23]
going to be more like 48 offuit or 34

[02:23]
going to be more like 48 offuit or 34
offsuit or queen three offuit, queen

[02:26]
offsuit or queen three offuit, queen

[02:26]
offsuit or queen three offuit, queen
deuce offsuit. So like I figured it's

[02:28]
deuce offsuit. So like I figured it's

[02:28]
deuce offsuit. So like I figured it's
easy for him to over bluff. And I feel

[02:31]
easy for him to over bluff. And I feel

[02:31]
easy for him to over bluff. And I feel
like the bluffing range contains less

[02:33]
like the bluffing range contains less

[02:33]
like the bluffing range contains less
equity than if we would for example be

[02:34]
equity than if we would for example be

[02:34]
equity than if we would for example be
in a big blind button situation where he

[02:36]
in a big blind button situation where he

[02:36]
in a big blind button situation where he
would for example even have king n off

[02:37]
would for example even have king n off

[02:38]
would for example even have king n off
which I think usually just checks back.

[02:39]
which I think usually just checks back.

[02:39]
which I think usually just checks back.
So I thought I thought because we were

[02:40]
So I thought I thought because we were

[02:40]
So I thought I thought because we were
blind versus blind and I thought the guy

[02:42]
blind versus blind and I thought the guy

[02:42]
blind versus blind and I thought the guy
was aggro uh over over aggro I thought

[02:46]
was aggro uh over over aggro I thought

[02:46]
was aggro uh over over aggro I thought
actually this hand yeah couldn't be that

[02:48]
actually this hand yeah couldn't be that

[02:48]
actually this hand yeah couldn't be that
bad.

[02:49]
bad.

[02:49]
bad.
&gt;&gt; Yeah and I I mean if he's like very high

[02:51]
&gt;&gt; Yeah and I I mean if he's like very high

[02:51]
&gt;&gt; Yeah and I I mean if he's like very high

Um but then they don't have a blocker to

[03:51]
Um but then they don't have a blocker to

[03:52]
Um but then they don't have a blocker to
the nuts. So they go to the small size

[03:55]
the nuts. So they go to the small size

[03:55]
the nuts. So they go to the small size
because it it's it's much easier to have

[03:57]
because it it's it's much easier to have

[03:57]
because it it's it's much easier to have
like some like low offsuit miss

[04:00]
like some like low offsuit miss

[04:00]
like some like low offsuit miss
than it is to have like like like the

and then then just triple it off here.

[04:12]
and then then just triple it off here.

[04:12]
and then then just triple it off here.
Um so I could see bluffs gravitating

[04:15]
Um so I could see bluffs gravitating

[04:15]
Um so I could see bluffs gravitating
towards here and it's not like

&gt;&gt; well, I guess I I guess they also have

[04:26]
&gt;&gt; well, I guess I I guess they also have

[04:26]
&gt;&gt; well, I guess I I guess they also have
like weak two pairs in this size. This

[04:28]
like weak two pairs in this size. This

feels to me as in position if you want

[04:33]
feels to me as in position if you want

[04:33]
feels to me as in position if you want
to jam. I mean, you could I would feel

[04:36]
to jam. I mean, you could I would feel

[04:36]
to jam. I mean, you could I would feel
pretty confident jamming king 10 and

[04:37]
pretty confident jamming king 10 and

[04:38]
pretty confident jamming king 10 and
then king six feels like king six feels

[04:40]
then king six feels like king six feels

[04:40]
then king six feels like king six feels
a bit close. And then I think once you

[04:42]
a bit close. And then I think once you

[04:42]
a bit close. And then I think once you
get to king five cuz like you're

[04:44]
get to king five cuz like you're

get to king five cuz like you're
chopping with like king five which will

Um,

[04:52]
Um,

[04:52]
Um,
so, so yeah, I I guess there's actually

[04:55]
so, so yeah, I I guess there's actually

&gt;&gt; Actually, I was maybe even a little bit
concerned about the sizing. Actually, I

[05:37]
concerned about the sizing. Actually, I

[05:37]
concerned about the sizing. Actually, I
would have maybe liked to see a bigger

would have maybe liked to see a bigger

[05:38]
would have maybe liked to see a bigger
sizing uh to kind of kind of what you

[05:41]
sizing uh to kind of kind of what you

I was actually a bit concerned about
sort of the downsize that it would be a

[05:48]
sort of the downsize that it would be a

[05:48]
sort of the downsize that it would be a
bit more.

[05:49]

&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering if there's like is

[11:08]
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering if there's like is

[11:08]
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering if there's like is
there like a blocking range to carve out

[11:10]
there like a blocking range to carve out

[11:10]
there like a blocking range to carve out
here? It's like Okay. So that so yeah,

[11:12]
here? It's like Okay. So that so yeah,

[11:12]
here? It's like Okay. So that so yeah,
you could block like nines and ace8 I

[11:15]
you could block like nines and ace8 I

[11:15]
you could block like nines and ace8 I
guess like so you could block some of

[11:16]
guess like so you could block some of

[11:16]
guess like so you could block some of
those hands. Um and then you have like

[11:20]
those hands. Um and then you have like

[11:20]
those hands. Um and then you have like
so it feels like there's there's like a

[11:22]
so it feels like there's there's like a

[11:22]
so it feels like there's there's like a
blocking range to protect and then

[11:23]
blocking range to protect and then

[11:23]
blocking range to protect and then
there's quite a thin checking range I

[11:27]
there's quite a thin checking range I

[11:27]
there's quite a thin checking range I
would guess. Um this hand strength feels

[11:30]
would guess. Um this hand strength feels

[11:30]
would guess. Um this hand strength feels
like it would be pretty reasonable to

[11:32]
like it would be pretty reasonable to

[11:32]
like it would be pretty reasonable to
protect the checking range, but you

[11:34]
protect the checking range, but you

[11:34]
protect the checking range, but you
don't want to overdo it cuz the checking

[11:35]
don't want to overdo it cuz the checking

[11:36]
don't want to overdo it cuz the checking
range is kind of thin. So, I wouldn't

[11:38]
range is kind of thin. So, I wouldn't

[11:38]
range is kind of thin. So, I wouldn't
mind like I actually weird as it seems,

[11:41]
mind like I actually weird as it seems,

[11:41]
mind like I actually weird as it seems,
I wouldn't mind check calling this, but

[11:42]
I wouldn't mind check calling this, but

[11:42]
I wouldn't mind check calling this, but
you could also just like bet out for

[11:44]
you could also just like bet out for

[11:44]
you could also just like bet out for
like 75 or something yourself. I I think

[11:47]
like 75 or something yourself. I I think

[11:47]
like 75 or something yourself. I I think
overb is kind of overkill here. I don't

[11:50]
overb is kind of overkill here. I don't

[11:50]
overb is kind of overkill here. I don't
know. I mean, I could be off like we do

[11:52]
know. I mean, I could be off like we do

[11:52]
know. I mean, I could be off like we do
we do still have trips in this spot, but

[11:53]
we do still have trips in this spot, but

[11:53]
we do still have trips in this spot, but
like in position just in position

improves a lot as well. Um, so I think

[11:57]
improves a lot as well. Um, so I think

[11:57]
improves a lot as well. Um, so I think
you can't like really go massive here. I

[11:59]
you can't like really go massive here. I

[11:59]
you can't like really go massive here. I
think the biggest sizes I'd really want

[12:01]
think the biggest sizes I'd really want

[12:01]
think the biggest sizes I'd really want
to use here would be like around pot.

[12:03]
to use here would be like around pot.

[12:03]
to use here would be like around pot.
Yeah, I would also not go very big for

Yeah, I would also not go very big for

Yeah, I would also not go very big for

obvious I wouldn't bet.

[12:28]
obvious I wouldn't bet.

[12:28]
obvious I wouldn't bet.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz the thing is when you block

[12:30]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz the thing is when you block

[12:30]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz the thing is when you block
with this hand,

[12:32]
with this hand,

[12:32]
with this hand,
uh, like other than getting raised by a

[12:35]
uh, like other than getting raised by a

[12:35]
uh, like other than getting raised by a
bluff, you'd kind of be trying to get

[12:37]
bluff, you'd kind of be trying to get

[12:38]
bluff, you'd kind of be trying to get
raised by a king, right? Or aces. And I

[12:41]
raised by a king, right? Or aces. And I

[12:41]
raised by a king, right? Or aces. And I
don't really think they have a very

[12:43]
don't really think they have a very

[12:43]
don't really think they have a very
strong king here.

[12:44]
strong king here.

[12:44]
strong king here.
&gt;&gt; But do you think they Yeah. Like I said,

[12:46]
&gt;&gt; But do you think they Yeah. Like I said,

[12:46]
&gt;&gt; But do you think they Yeah. Like I said,
probably bets bets the term, right?

[12:48]
probably bets bets the term, right?

[12:48]
probably bets bets the term, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So they they don't

[12:50]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So they they don't

[12:50]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So they they don't
have these hands. So, so then, so then

[12:52]
have these hands. So, so then, so then

[12:52]
have these hands. So, so then, so then
when you block and like when you block

[12:55]
when you block and like when you block

[12:55]
when you block and like when you block
and you try to get raised, it's kind of

[12:57]
and you try to get raised, it's kind of

[12:57]
and you try to get raised, it's kind of
like, okay, obviously we're calling when

[12:58]
like, okay, obviously we're calling when

[12:58]
like, okay, obviously we're calling when
we get raised with this hand, but we

[13:00]
we get raised with this hand, but we

[13:00]
we get raised with this hand, but we
didn't actually ever get raised by

[13:02]
didn't actually ever get raised by

[13:02]
didn't actually ever get raised by
anything worse, right? So, I' I' I'd

[13:05]
anything worse, right? So, I' I' I'd

[13:05]
anything worse, right? So, I' I' I'd
kind of rather if I was going to protect

[13:07]
kind of rather if I was going to protect

[13:07]
kind of rather if I was going to protect
the blocking range, I'd rather have like

[13:08]
the blocking range, I'd rather have like

[13:08]
the blocking range, I'd rather have like
a queen jack, you know? So, I'm actually

[13:11]
a queen jack, you know? So, I'm actually

[13:11]
a queen jack, you know? So, I'm actually
getting like queen jack is the sort of

[13:13]
getting like queen jack is the sort of

[13:13]
getting like queen jack is the sort of
hand where like say you bet 75 and they

[13:15]
hand where like say you bet 75 and they

[13:15]
hand where like say you bet 75 and they
just call the jack 10, you got less

[13:18]
just call the jack 10, you got less

[13:18]
just call the jack 10, you got less
money in than if you block and got

[13:19]
money in than if you block and got

[13:20]
money in than if you block and got
raised.

[13:20]
raised.

[13:20]
raised.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Whereas like this hand, if you bet

[13:23]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Whereas like this hand, if you bet

[13:23]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Whereas like this hand, if you bet
75 and they call their jack 10, you

[13:24]
75 and they call their jack 10, you

[13:24]
75 and they call their jack 10, you
actually save some money compared to

[13:26]
actually save some money compared to

[13:26]
actually save some money compared to
like blocking like raising. So, so I

[13:29]
like blocking like raising. So, so I

[13:29]
like blocking like raising. So, so I
think there's like this small

[13:30]
think there's like this small

[13:30]
think there's like this small
interaction going on there where I think

[13:32]
interaction going on there where I think

[13:32]
interaction going on there where I think
this one fits a little bit better is

[13:33]
this one fits a little bit better is

[13:34]
this one fits a little bit better is
like if we're going to if we're going to

[13:35]
like if we're going to if we're going to

not like just bet out our hand strength,

[13:37]
not like just bet out our hand strength,

[13:37]
not like just bet out our hand strength,
we should probably go into like a

[13:39]
we should probably go into like a

[13:39]
we should probably go into like a
checking range.

[13:40]
checking range.

[13:40]
checking range.
&gt;&gt; Um, so those are the two things and I

[13:42]
&gt;&gt; Um, so those are the two things and I

[13:42]
&gt;&gt; Um, so those are the two things and I
would try and avoid the block. Um, I

[13:44]
would try and avoid the block. Um, I

[13:44]
would try and avoid the block. Um, I
mean my thresholds are going to be a

[13:45]
mean my thresholds are going to be a

[13:45]
mean my thresholds are going to be a
little bit off here. I could just have

[13:47]
little bit off here. I could just have

like you get here and it's like well so

[24:21]
like you get here and it's like well so

like you get here and it's like well so
so then you face that on the turn and

[24:22]
so then you face that on the turn and

[24:22]
so then you face that on the turn and
like yeah my immediate thought was like

[24:23]
like yeah my immediate thought was like

[24:24]
like yeah my immediate thought was like
okay this range actually feels a lot

[24:26]
okay this range actually feels a lot
