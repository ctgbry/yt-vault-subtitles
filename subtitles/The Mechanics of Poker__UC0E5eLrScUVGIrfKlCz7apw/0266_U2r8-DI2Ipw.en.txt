This is part two of Owen reviewing some
of the favorite hands I played during
the midsection version of the Cash Game
World Championship. We have reviewed
three hands in part one. We left with
average score of 7.7
so far. We have four more hands that
we're going to review in this video. Are
we able to rise above this 7.7 or is he
going to tear our game down even
further? Next to Owen's opinion, I'm
also curious what you guys would rate my
hands. So, leave them in the comment
down below. 1 to 10. Also, if you liked
any of the hands, make sure to like this
video and let's get into the action. So,
limp small bllight villain maybe also
important to to add. The pool was pretty
aggressive, but this guy was, you know,
another level. He definitely was there
to fight like a type type of like 54
type of woman was a flop guy,
&gt;&gt; you know, like to like like to win all
the pots, like to be strong everywhere,
pretend like he's strong everywhere.
&gt;&gt; He raises a limp called the 68 suited.
So far, so good. I assume uh
see that's one/3
we call. Yeah.
Okay. Fing.
Um I mean kind of feels
feels sort of just meh and mixed. Um
can't just f can't just call a king
here. We have we have some jack eggs
though that we could like limp call.
It's not nice to like it's really
annoying to just call these sort of
hands and then like lose on river
because they river like third pair.
&gt;&gt; [laughter]
&gt;&gt; But like if the guy's going to try and
run you over then. Um yeah, happy to
come along with this. I'm sort of
suspecting [laughter] that you might
have raised it. Like is that what
happened? [laughter]
Did well do we get do we get deep in the
weeds? Okay. No, we didn't. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; So, but actually I want to maybe add
some point. I feel like if this was like
for example big plan button, I'm way
less happy because then you know like a
primary bluff for example would be queen
10 off. But I feel like since we play
blind versus blind, the queen 10 off is
not really in there. So the bluffs are
going to be more like 48 offuit or 34
offsuit or queen three offuit, queen
deuce offsuit. So like I figured it's
easy for him to over bluff. And I feel
like the bluffing range contains less
equity than if we would for example be
in a big blind button situation where he
would for example even have king n off
which I think usually just checks back.
So I thought I thought because we were
blind versus blind and I thought the guy
was aggro uh over over aggro I thought
actually this hand yeah couldn't be that
bad.
&gt;&gt; Yeah and I I mean if he's like very high
woman saw flop he's not going to shy
away with like queen three or something.
&gt;&gt; I thought maybe also also maybe like
like a five offshoot 53 offshoot like a
little murderous ace queen or something
or like ace nine of clubs of me
something like that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter] Yeah. Sometimes
sometimes you see some some interesting
showdowns from these guys where they
just decided to bluff me. But yeah,
so River 10, it's good. He probably So
he doesn't have 10 nine offsuit, right?
He doesn't have queen n offsuit. All
these hands that now big button would
suck.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Um
Yeah. It's kind of I think this size.
What is this? This is like uh what ace
king aces.
If the idea is that he has lots of like
the lower like offsuit stuff.
I think what might go for midstakes
guy's head is oh stuff got there. I'm
going to bluff.
Um but then they don't have a blocker to
the nuts. So they go to the small size
because it it's it's much easier to have
like some like low offsuit miss
than it is to have like like like the
the queen free hands are like a fair bit
more like exotic of a find than like I
don't know if you if you raise 84 off
and then then just triple it off here.
Um so I could see bluffs gravitating
towards here and it's not like
uh I mean what's the SPR on river? It's
like three.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I mean,
&gt;&gt; well, I guess I I guess they also have
like weak two pairs in this size. This
isn't just going to be aces and ace
king. So that So basically, it just
feels to me as in position if you want
to jam. I mean, you could I would feel
pretty confident jamming king 10 and
then king six feels like king six feels
a bit close. And then I think once you
get to king five cuz like you're
chopping with like king five which will
slow play, uh that's getting too thin.
Um,
so, so yeah, I I guess there's actually
I mean, and what there's like 65 off
like Jack six off, Jack five off can be
in there. [laughter] Oh god, it's really
not helpful that I don't know the
ranges.
&gt;&gt; But but but that's the thing, right?
It's BVB, so he can basically have
anything, right? Because we we don't
know because like a lot of these a lot a
lot of these hands are like frequencies,
right? Like ah like jack five off is a
frequency. Does he get it? Like we we
don't know, right? Um,
I don't know. I'm just trying to talk
myself into the hero here, but
I'm like I'm not I'm not I'm not
entirely sold on it. Like Okay. I I said
I'm guessing you called it off. Like
what what sold you on like why this was
a slam dunk spot to call off.
&gt;&gt; Actually, I was maybe even a little bit
concerned about the sizing. Actually, I
would have maybe liked to see a bigger
sizing uh to kind of kind of what you
said, right? That oh yeah, now nuts come
in. You don't have the nuts. So actually
I was actually a bit concerned about
sort of the downsize that it would be a
bit more.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You know like let's say he has queen
three off. I felt like he would just jam
it or even like four seven off you know
that just like oh you you don't have ace
queen or you don't have queen nine. I'm
I'm going to ship it max pressure
something along those lines. So actually
I was planning on already sort of
calling down. I expected actually a
bigger bet and then this bet came and I
was actually a bit torn and it kind of
it was similar to what you said. I was
like, "Okay, yeah, but you can also just
have a shitty hand like 48 offuit or
something or, you know, something that
just has nothing and it's like, yeah, I
don't want to I don't want to
necessarily jam my stack in." Um, and I
just thought, listen, it's BVB. The guy
is aggressive. He can basically have any
[ __ ] two type of cards. Uh, uh, I I
feel like also on this river, like if if
he gets here with air, feel like he's
always following through. So there's no
discussion that he's like, "Oh, I 48, I
give up." that I don't think exists uh
on this run out.
&gt;&gt; It's also it's like um it's very hard
for a red liner to value trick this spot
like like usually the way red liners get
away with spewing off too much is they
can go thinner. It's quite hard to go
thinner here. like they they kind of get
like like king queen is b b b b b b b b
b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b
b b b b b b b b b b b basically like
they start running into your own king
queen off and then it's like they 100%
can't go king nine and then king queen
is already getting kind of greedy like
like they definitely are beat a lot when
they have that hand.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And like for example king nine
again because it's BVB probably doesn't
raise much king N offuit. Same with king
10 off suit. So I felt like also a lot
of his value reduced.
Yeah, it's quite like when you're up
against these guys and like they can't
own you by going like five notches too
thin. Uh like that's just out of the
question. It does make me feel a lot
better about calling them down because
their instinct with the bluff is still
typically the same.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like [laughter]
they still want to [ __ ] send it. I'm
s I'm I'm sort I'm coming around a bit.
I I I don't know like where I would have
got to in game. Um, but yeah, I I I I
can I can see the call.
&gt;&gt; Verdict before before the show comes.
&gt;&gt; Um, verdict before the showdown. Um,
feels like sort of seven out of 10, but
there's like there's like a bonus if he
has a super illegal showdown. [snorts]
Like if he has a missed combo draw, you
get like plus 1.5
&gt;&gt; and he has if he has king nine, I don't
mind.
&gt;&gt; That's how I think of it. Oh yeah, yeah,
yeah. If he has king nine, if he has
king nine, we're in the mud. Like if he
has king, it's so bad.
&gt;&gt; He has aces.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's like that
[laughter] doesn't doesn't really tell
us much. So, so yeah. Yeah. This one
seems
&gt;&gt; all right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Seems fine. Do doing some defense
against a red liner. How bad can it be?
&gt;&gt; That's that that is my model. How bad
can it be?
&gt;&gt; All right. Button opens. We flat uh jack
nine of hearts in the small blind. Mhm.
Okay. I mean, I don't I don't really
know about too much about leading these
spots. I mean, in uh in regular six, it
wouldn't seem like a leading board to
me, but I'll just like I'll just assume
it's fine. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Probably a freaking
&gt;&gt; How bad can it be?
&gt;&gt; Didn't call.
&gt;&gt; Probably. [laughter] Hopefully.
&gt;&gt; I think also the Jack Nine, if you think
about if you want to lead something, I
think Jack N.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Like yeah, it seems okay.
Yeah, turn I think. I mean, yeah, it
feels kind of feels like a kind of polar
spot, but like I I feel like Jack N
wants to triple barrel a block or
something, but it's like a sideline.
Like the main thing you do is get polar
here, but you sometimes but I feel like
when you block and he doesn't raise
there is still these sort of like you
have a bunch of you have a bunch of top
pairs which
your leading is going to be centered
around and like especially the stronger
ones will probably raise for him like
the over pairs will raise. So then when
he doesn't raise I think those hands
kind of like they wouldn't mind keeping
initiative like the much bigger part of
the strategy is going to be like the
polarizing to like you know turn top
pair and sets or whatever.
&gt;&gt; Yeah I could see for example let's say I
let king 10 off suit with a club or
something. I can definitely see that
that for me would have been more
intuitive but like like you said I kind
of saw this spot and I was thinking
mainly okay a lot of checking and
like some big betting.
&gt;&gt; Yeah
&gt;&gt; but not a lot. That's kind of how I how
I saw the spot in the moment.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then and then this is one
this is the kind of river where then
like the turn strategy you're playing
feeds into like how the river plays,
right? If you're playing something with
more blocking on the turn, then you
obviously make less trips on the river.
Um but like assuming that we're not and
we're just playing polo, we actually
make trips at quite high frequency here.
We're we're at quite big disadvantage in
flushes though. So, I feel like we get
to carve out some medium bets. I mean,
okay, what else do we have in our range?
Okay, it's hard because we we might have
been inventing a donkey here on the fly.
We're going to have some like have some
like a eight, some ax and clubs, some
like pocket nines,
&gt;&gt; some sevens with a club.
&gt;&gt; Probably lead that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Something like that. Like
bits of 65 or whatever.
&gt;&gt; I'm just wondering if there's like is
there like a blocking range to carve out
here? It's like Okay. So that so yeah,
you could block like nines and ace8 I
guess like so you could block some of
those hands. Um and then you have like
so it feels like there's there's like a
blocking range to protect and then
there's quite a thin checking range I
would guess. Um this hand strength feels
like it would be pretty reasonable to
protect the checking range, but you
don't want to overdo it cuz the checking
range is kind of thin. So, I wouldn't
mind like I actually weird as it seems,
I wouldn't mind check calling this, but
you could also just like bet out for
like 75 or something yourself. I I think
overb is kind of overkill here. I don't
know. I mean, I could be off like we do
we do still have trips in this spot, but
like in position just in position
improves a lot as well. Um, so I think
you can't like really go massive here. I
think the biggest sizes I'd really want
to use here would be like around pot.
Yeah, I would also not go very big for
the basically the reason you said right.
He has a bunch of jackacks. He can have
better. I ended up for block like kind
of what you said. I in my range I kind
of thought okay I can have an eight and
had like nines. I even felt like sevens
with a club that would be going very
thin. Uh but I kind of saw that as well
even to some degree. Uh like a six
obvious I wouldn't bet.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz the thing is when you block
with this hand,
uh, like other than getting raised by a
bluff, you'd kind of be trying to get
raised by a king, right? Or aces. And I
don't really think they have a very
strong king here.
&gt;&gt; But do you think they Yeah. Like I said,
probably bets bets the term, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So they they don't
have these hands. So, so then, so then
when you block and like when you block
and you try to get raised, it's kind of
like, okay, obviously we're calling when
we get raised with this hand, but we
didn't actually ever get raised by
anything worse, right? So, I' I' I'd
kind of rather if I was going to protect
the blocking range, I'd rather have like
a queen jack, you know? So, I'm actually
getting like queen jack is the sort of
hand where like say you bet 75 and they
just call the jack 10, you got less
money in than if you block and got
raised.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Whereas like this hand, if you bet
75 and they call their jack 10, you
actually save some money compared to
like blocking like raising. So, so I
think there's like this small
interaction going on there where I think
this one fits a little bit better is
like if we're going to if we're going to
not like just bet out our hand strength,
we should probably go into like a
checking range.
&gt;&gt; Um, so those are the two things and I
would try and avoid the block. Um, I
mean my thresholds are going to be a
little bit off here. I could just have
like the handstring slightly off and
like
&gt;&gt; I think in a vacuum I agree with like if
you just think jack n three4 is probably
kind of what it carves out most of the
time.
&gt;&gt; They can have like jack seven off though
they can have a bunch of other worst
jacks. Like as long as they never just
flat jack to this then this is fine
actually. Um yeah, and then like
obviously calling and then I mean if he
has like I feel bad for him if he has
like the value trick king nine because I
feel like it's quite a nice play but
yeah um I mean yeah obviously obviously
calling well I mean I don't know I say
obviously did he come over the top did
he like wrap the boat or something? No
[laughter] way. [gasps]
Tell me no.
All right. This is fun.
Uh okay. So it's like calling his hy but
you're like you're you're saying he
never calls the jam
&gt;&gt; ba basically I thought my my line was
pretty credible like we said on the turn
right it's very polar I probably want
want to check race for a hand like
pocket eight probably just always check
raising I would say is best candidate
sixes sometimes especially with with a
diamond uh king jack I think makes also
a lot of sense for me to lead flop check
turn uh I just see a lot of and then the
block also makes super sense. I don't
know. I thought this story made sense on
all streets. Uh and yeah, what is my
bluff?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter]
Well, yeah. I mean,
&gt;&gt; if we go down that line.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean that that there is like
like what is my bluff? Like it it is
nice when you don't have obvious bluffs,
but eventually you do get tagged as like
[laughter]
as like we'll show up with something.
Um, so yeah, I
&gt;&gt; mean it's not like we have completely
nothing, right? He should probably check
back like some jack six of heart, jack,
eight of hearts, maybe on the turn
sometime some king jack. It does plays
it's it is sort of better than
&gt;&gt; I I I I think I mean this is kind of
this this is just flashback to what I
said at the start like he's [ __ ]
capped. [laughter]
He is [ __ ] capped. He checks back
like he checked back this super dynamic
board and you're just like you can't
have a boat here. I I can have a missed
the check raise. Get [ __ ] [laughter]
Then he also, you know, he raises the
kind of smaller size as well. I think
he's saying a bit. I mean, but then I
don't know like usually when usually
people raise a smaller size and it's a
super like and it's a trap, it's going
to be saying super nutted, but he
doesn't really have any hands which want
the smoke, you know?
&gt;&gt; No, I feel like I feel like
&gt;&gt; if he he just wants to target a jack,
right? Let's say he just has a nut a
good flush. He's like, "Oh, let me go a
little bit bigger." Well, it's like
yeah, it also even if you have a nut
flush, if you raise this size and then
get jammed on, you're not like, "Ah,
yeah, so psych to get this action." Like
the other person is erecting a boat. Um,
so in order to be hyped to get you to
come over the top, he would need to have
a boat, which like he just doesn't have.
Like there's no way anyone's telling me
that. That said, [laughter] it's quite
possible to click call with hands just
click call with weak hands. And also
flush and trips don't even feel [snorts]
that weak. Um
&gt;&gt; for a small play call range.
&gt;&gt; I mean
yeah but it's like okay so flush they're
going to be attached to cuz they riveted
it and trips is going to be good
blockers. Um
it's kind of interesting. Yeah. I mean,
depends how much of I I [laughter]
can I can see actually the
pre-justification now of like, oh yeah,
I was playing a high frequency check on
the turn, right? I [laughter] get it. I
get it. I had lots of traps here. I
promise.
Uh I don't know. No, I'm not I'm not
going to sell myself on this being the
player with Jack N. No, I don't think
so. I just take another hand. This is
too like
Noah. No, [laughter]
I'm Yeah, this one's going to have to go
in like I I can kind of see the spots. I
don't think it's a complete disaster
class, but this is the kind Yeah, I I
think this is more like this is more
like Yeah, we're going to say three out
of 10. [laughter] I don't want to do it
with this hand even like
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Also, like I say that it might be
plus EV in a vacuum. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; It's plus three out of 10.
Yeah. Yeah. [laughter] Yeah. Yeah. That
doesn't like that. These are show
tables, right? He's a show.
&gt;&gt; He f He fold it. That's at least a four
out of 10. Then [laughter]
&gt;&gt; I did I did suspect his guy in the fold.
I I was really rooting for he calls a
worse hand. That would have been so
funny. [laughter]
Then instant 10th.
I I I mean I just can't like I think
it's just I don't like the idea that
some guy's going to get to see in one
showdown in one showdown that you're
coming after someone this hard like you
know what I mean? [laughter] I [gasps] I
feel like it's I mean that might be
heads up mindset.
Um, but I I I always feel like I I want
them to at least have to do some
digging, you know, like like I'm sure,
you know, anyone can DB review you and
you shouldn't be like too scared of this
stuff, especially it, you know,
especially if stuff's only a little bit
out of line. Um, like like but like I
want to make sure that like like this is
the kind of thing when it shows on the
table, it's like immediate paragraph
long note in notepad or something. Um,
[laughter]
so which I I try to avoid giving people
over one pot. I'd ra I'd rather they
have to put a few more puzzle pieces
together than this, which is why which
is why I'm I'm not a fan because like
you can have the Eevee of this hand, but
like if you can do [ __ ] like this to
someone, you can print so much Eevee
with stuff which is a bit more subtle.
&gt;&gt; Like you can, you know, you can like set
yourself up for this play with a hand
which doesn't give anywhere near as much
away and they just think you found a
nice bluff and they think you found it
again and again and again.
&gt;&gt; What would it be? Uh, I mean you could
just do this with like you could just do
this with Ace8 and it's much better,
right? Um, you could like you could
rebluff some like random diamond combo
nines with a diamond even just something
which looks like something which is a
little bit less offensive on the eyes
when it shows that like like even even
if it's like even if it's not
technically accurate if there's
a
&gt;&gt; if they think it makes sense. There's
sort of a thing of being like also if a
spot is hard to bluff, I'm kind of like
forgiving of people having non
techchnically accurate combos. You know,
if a spot is really easy to bluff and
then someone has a really out there
combo, it says a lot more than when you
get a spot like this and it's like Yeah.
But because now they get a read of like
the next time they're in like hard to
find bluffs versus wacko like you know
this is like [snorts] Yeah. It's like ah
I can't tell what he bluffs here. I
guess he'll show me. You know, that read
can be uh that I mean, it can get you
paid, but it's it's one I'd rather not
give people for free. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Makes sense. Makes sense. All right, I
I'll I'll accept it. I [clears throat]
think you made good arguments.
&gt;&gt; Are you grinding hard, studying solvers,
reviewing hands, but still not getting
those results that you know you're
capable of. You're putting in the time
and effort, but without clear direction,
that effort does not pay off. That is
why I created the Mechanics leakbuster
program, which is the exact system I
used to make over seven figures playing
online poker and have since taught to
hundreds of students so they could do
the same. Through our league finder
stats and pop-ups, you will gain clarity
on your biggest leaks and tendencies,
insights on how your strategies have
been performing in game, and the impact
variance has had on your results. But
knowing your stats is only the
beginning. In the program, we dig deep
into the root causes behind your leaks
and tendencies and use a proven
sevenstep system to fix them for good
and gain the skills to improve and
continuously evolve. As a poker player,
you'll study more effectively, overcome
leaks and tendencies that felt
impossible to break, and rebuild trust
and confidence in your game, finally
seeing your hard work pay off as you
move up the stakes. So, if you're ready

[laughter] Okay, nice. Uh, all right. We
have ace five of spades and we decide to
three bet from the big blind button
calls.
I decide to check.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh,
it's interesting spot. Super encouraging
time for them to get bananas on.
And he does this. Uh, yeah. This is
interesting. Okay.
[laughter]
Am I getting a good price because I have
0%.
[laughter]
[gasps] I'm still calling now. River
decisions are interesting.
Yeah, this kind of felt like it was
coming a lot after that turn.
I know. I mean, maybe ju just just
because it's like
um I think the technical play is not
super accurate at these stakes.
So, it's like when they do this where
they're kind of repping, they're going
very thin for value or like they're
taking like these pair plus draw combos
or whatever just for protection and
stuff. I the mistakes guys I I typically
tend to be like like show that you know
this is the play. Um I I think I think
those hands are quite intuitive to check
back and then building like a small
barreling range around like 10 9 is like
I mean once you see it it kind of makes
sense but I think a lot of them are just
more polar than they should be. So then
like you get here and it's like well so
so then you face that on the turn and
like yeah my immediate thought was like
okay this range actually feels a lot
more polar than than it is. So then I'm
not really surprised to see a rip on the
river once we get to the river. Like I
mean the ace is just really [ __ ]
nice. Like just we're unblocking all of
the dust.
Um
five is five is pretty nice too. Uh it's
not really that hard to bluff. Like they
have like tons of nuts.
Um so I mean this this seems like a
pretty legit cool down hand. Yeah. I'm
I'm Yeah, I'm pretty down to call down
A5 here. Like just Yeah. I'm blocking
everything.
&gt;&gt; [snorts]
&gt;&gt; You did you did the whole analysis for
me, so I have nothing to add.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. He has the miss combo your
as well. It's so beautiful. That's so
nice. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Plus one because
he has an illegal hand. I mean, it is We
didn't have too many other options, but
it does feel like super clean. And then
he has an illegal hand as well, which
makes it so so nice. Um well I mean it
it might not be like it might not be
entirely illegal but it's like like to a
human they know they're putting their
hand in the cookie jar when they take
this hand
&gt;&gt; even if solver is sometimes like th like
like like this is the last hand which he
chooses to bluff like this is pro like
maybe he has some nut flush draws which
are like
&gt;&gt; after this but like this is definitely
way up there and like like so so when
you see this versus a human especially
like in this championship it just kind
of makes me think that the guy went Like
the guy just said he just said that
you're capped and then went all right
stack goes in. Um and then Yeah. Yeah.
It's just Yeah, we have a weak hand and
we call down anyway because we don't
believe you. Yeah. Nice [snorts]
&gt;&gt; verdict.
&gt;&gt; I'm going to say yeah I I was saying AR
10 but yeah plus one like nine because
of the showdown. Like
&gt;&gt; that just that just makes it like super
clean when you see this. It's like
&gt;&gt; so confident. Uh cutoff opens. We call
sevens. Uh seven of clubs, seven of
hearts from the small blind. Flops eight
by three. He see bets.
We
&gt;&gt; All right. Yeah, just uh just calling
standard.
&gt;&gt; Just calling [laughter] standard.
&gt;&gt; No, no minra raising.
&gt;&gt; No, no raising. Oh, I would have liked
it. I [snorts] wouldn't have minded. Uh
turn is seven. So we turn a set, but
there's a lot of blue cards on the
board.
Yeah, I mean I think they so imposition
tends to have advantage in offuit cards.
So I don't think you lead this ever. Um
I wonder yeah I mean [laughter]
I don't I don't really I don't really
know how like this was with anti, right?
Um yeah, it must have been you called
like a 3x open in the small.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Um,
yeah. I mean, I I'm not sure like like
gen generally the opener has the
advantage in the offse hands, but then
also they're c betting a wide range.
You're calling a filtered one. They
could be overseetting and you're like
filtered to board connections. I can see
justifications. I wouldn't lead here,
but I I I don't hate it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. like pure I thought like pure pure
denial of let's say if queen jack of
spades is still what eight still 16%
equity is not bad
&gt;&gt; yeah there's also there's this funny
thing which happens where if you lead a
spot like this they assume you know what
you're doing like [laughter] if you lead
it looks like you've studied and like
&gt;&gt; are you
make it like kind of I know what I'm
doing man [laughter]
&gt;&gt; but like you know it's like if in doubt
and then you They're just like, "Oh, he
must have studied this spot."
&gt;&gt; Fair.
&gt;&gt; So, it's quite scary to play back into
someone when it's like this is their
prep. Like, they know what they're
doing. I'm like, you know, I don't know
what's going on. And it like it takes
some like both some like balls and then
also some like understanding of like
understanding that that is what's
happening. You know, that's why you're
having an emotional respon because
sometimes you can have an emotional
response to not play back, which makes
sense. But a lot of the time it can just
come from being lost and they and then
yeah, a lot of what separates like
really elite players is that they can be
lost and they'll still make your life
hard. Um, so yeah, like sometimes you'll
get like overly passive or like overly
spewy responses even. But yeah, just uh
just trying to trying to sell myself on
it. [snorts]
So he raises,
&gt;&gt; right? He raises
&gt;&gt; what's this?
Yeah. I mean
&gt;&gt; I'm kind of guessing you three about
him.
Like I'm kind of guessing. Yeah, these
ones are kind of these ones are kind of
fun. Um
they're Yeah, they're always a bit weird
cuz it's like really hard to have a draw
on these boards. And then also typically
what happens is if the board pairs, it's
supposed to be really bad for us. So
then when you do have a boat on the
board pairing, it's like it's it's like
extra like EV because when they go for
their really small raise, they can
definitely have like sets and two pair
and whatever. Um
but whereas when when you when you free
bet, if you're doing that, it's strictly
a bluff. Well, I say a bluff, but like
when you take pocket sevens, you do get
called by like pocket fives, pocket
threes. I don't know if you get much
better to fold it. Just But it does have
some some like nice things going on.
like it it it essentially boils down to
like having some equity and also giving
you board coverage on the boards where
like where they're going to put in tons
of money for you. It's it you'll just
have a strong hand on the boards where
it's really nice to have a strong hand
in this line. So So yeah,
&gt;&gt; don't you feel like if I if I block
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I can kind of
&gt;&gt; and he he now raises let's say has queen
jack with a diamond and I come over the
top, he's basically always folding
because it's like listen I have I cannot
improve. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I can I can just have 0%.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, I definitely think he he can just
raise fold there with with queen jack.
&gt;&gt; Those hands aren't really supposed to
those hands aren't really supposed to
raise.
&gt;&gt; But are they like with his sizing as
well? Like it feels like it's like
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean actually Yeah. No, to be
fair to be fair, he can definitely have
like a weaker diamond here
&gt;&gt; and 10%
&gt;&gt; but but like the way this is supposed to
work is that is that like he has strong
diamonds and then he has protection
raises.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but we know what we're doing. know
and remember we established that we know
what we're doing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [laughter]
Like [clears throat]
Yeah. I got to remember like they can
just have the 10 of diamonds and just be
like just be like probably best hand and
instead of just realizing they can just
call and like play rivers. Um yeah like
there there was actually a lot of
impatience in the championship. I
remember like people wanted to get to
their pot size now. [laughter] They
wanted to have initiative. They didn't
really like the idea of just like you
know there were more streets coming
where they could play cards on.
&gt;&gt; I think the only like natural bluff al
even if you if you can even call it
natural only natural kind of bluff that
I could find for myself maybe sixes with
a diamond like the straight flush draw
if we're talking about outs.
&gt;&gt; Uh
&gt;&gt; oh yeah kind of thing.
&gt;&gt; But then but then you know then you have
pretty decent equity also for threes. Uh
actually no you're ahead for threes and
fives. Uh, so yeah, that's like the only
hand that I could think about. I thought
the seven specifically was very nice to
make him fold like the queen jack and
just get called by the threes and the
fives.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right, tell me
&gt;&gt; you've got really bad timing for this
one cuz I think I had this spot two days
ago on the other side and called them
down with bad. Oh, no. Actually, that'd
be good because you had bad beat.
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Oh,
that will be pure on it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [snorts] Yeah. so much value.
Yeah. Yeah. They like they they led the
turn, free bet me and then like bet
[laughter] the river and I just called
and they had random king eye and I was
like nice. Um
so yeah, I guess in that case having the
shitty hero calls beat is probably
pretty good. [snorts]
Um yeah, no I I think this this is quite
nice. It also it's definitely it's it's
getting some flare points because I
think most people don't find this
&gt;&gt; flare point.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we are still missing a river
though. But it but it's like it's
definitely there's a little bit more
going on like than than the than the
Jack 7 one. So I think this is more like
this is like 8.5 maybe maybe a nine like
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right. Well, these were the final
hands. Any uh any any feedback? You
know, may maybe I'll hop in the real
Casin World Championship. What What I
should not I should not put in the Jack
Nine of Hearts, right? That was too too
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I mean that's also like you
know that's speaking from perspective of
like playing a long-term game against
like rags who you you know high stakes
reging a bunch. I can see how the jack
nine of hearts goes in if you're like
you know in the kitchen against the mics
rags like cooking up something fancy
like [laughter] I can see how like as a
vacuum play like that's like that's
actually quite enticing. Um so so
[laughter] yeah like there are kind of
two different ratings for that one.
There's like the rating where like I'm
like, "Yeah, like like that's that
that's pretty nice." Like 8 out of 10 if
I'm just thinking about like we're never
going to see each other. Screen names
are off. This is like ignition or
whatever. [laughter] And then there's
like then there's the other one which is
like I was like Jesus Christ like
[laughter] Do you want people to never
fault you again?
But uh yeah, I mean no other than that I
was uh yeah uh really be behind most of
the players.
&gt;&gt; All right. Well, I I want to thank you
man for uh for coming on evaluating
these hands. Uh really looking forward
to the next Gas Game World Championship.
See you shine again. Any uh any final
words?
&gt;&gt; Had a lot of fun. This is uh yeah,
really exciting and uh yeah, I hope uh
hope people can see that there's a that
there's a lot of winter still to be had
at Midstakes Online. You can you can you
know, you can get away with a lot.
There's a lot to spot against these
guys, you know, [laughter]
and uh yeah, there's a a lot of stuff to
hunt down, which hopefully I can find
some people to to teach it to. Yeah.
Final score time after seven hands. The
average evaluation of Owen on the
Wackers game 7.4
out of 10. Clearly still have some work
to do before we can hop in with the big
boys. Learned a lot from Owen. So, thank
you. If you learned a lot as well, leave
a thumbs up, like this video, subscribe
