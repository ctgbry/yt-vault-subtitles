in today's video I'm going to be
focusing on another decisionmaking
question you have to ask yourself when
playing poker which is where should my
value come from now in the last video
that I made we talked about the concept
of equities mainly how range
construction leads to equities which
leads to certain incentives if we
continue on the topic of equity there
are situations where you will have a
huge Equity advantage and usually when
this happens by betting your oppon
opponent is forced to over fold so in a
situation like that if we ask ourselves
where should our value come from well
it's usually just making a bet because
we have a very high Equity Advantage
which forces our opponent to over fold
so betting due to the equities and the
over folding that's going on is often
going to be higher e than checking
compared to if we're in a situation
where the equities are closer together
fult Equity is going to be less because
your opponent is not forced to over fold
now next to to equity and ranges there
are two more important components when
considering where your value should come
from number one being the strength of
our hand number two being the Tendencies
of my opponent now every hand in your
range is interested in the pot becoming
a certain size if you look at our value
hands usually we will just play our
value hands for what they are worth then
we invent Bluffs around our value to
make sure that our opponent is Inc cized
to pay off our value let's dive into an
example so the example I picked here is
jack8 5 rainbow we're playing big BL
versus button check call a one3 cat turn
is a seven it goes check check and river
is a deuce up to us where should a value
come from given the strength of our hand
and when we say strength in this case we
mean our hand has a certain amount of
equity and from there we're going to
look at which type of actions certain
Equity profiles like to take okay
so let's start with the lowest type of
equity hands that we can have that are
made hands or at least that have some
sort of Showdown value going to talk
about the Bluffs at the end they clearly
want to check because they're too weak
to bet okay their value shouldn't come
from getting C their value should come
from checking and trying to get The
Showdown and depending on if you think
your opponent is bluffing a lot they
will probably be used for Bluff catchers
in position bets and indeed we can see
this region is going to be calling
around calling or raising around half of
the time okay these are Pluff catchers
so they should be placed as Pluff
catchers not as value bats so that would
be the first mistake that you can
eliminate if you are betting a lot of
these hands now do note that the smaller
sizing I gave here is 25% let's say we
give it a mimat then suddenly especially
in this profile the 50 to 60% equities
where we can actually see some betting
starting most probably if we give it a
10% option we can actually squeeze out
these hands
with it for a 10% bet okay basically the
lower your bet sizing the lower in
equity you can go to Value bet your hand
but you don't want to add 10% 25% then
it gets maybe a bit too complicated uh
so let's keep it this way 25% we can see
that from 50% Equity so basically the
higher our kicker in this case with our
seven the more we are going to be
betting simply because they're higher in
equity they get called by worse hand
more often okay so apparently this is
our value betting threshold these hands
they are close between well we could
actually get some value but if we check
we also get some Bluffs so the EVS are
the same basically it's gaining the same
amount of value in check by inducing
Bluffs As It Gets By betting 25% and
getting called so there's no clear
action profile with this hand it's the
hand class above 60 to 70% action where
we can see a very clear preference for
one action being better than the other
which is just to block and why is that
because an eight is trying to get value
from a seven so the 60 70% Equity hands
trying to get value of the 50 to 60%
Equity hands which if we check fin is
going to be checking behind most of the
time whereas if we would bet in this
case block it would never be folding a
seven or let's say for example a five
hence that it would always check behind
Okay so there's clear downsides in
checking and clear benefits in betting
now the reason I saw the ace 7 is
checking and you will see this quite
often for example PVB in delayed lines
or big BL first button and check all
check check this is again because if we
have the ace the ace is a hand that
would call a block bat very often as you
can see a high ace9 a queen Ace King and
if we check a high is going to check
behind most of the time so for the same
reason basically block blocking the
check packs is usually theistic why we
suddenly check and like that
so that was a 60 to 70% Equity 70 to 80
here we see it again a bit with the8 but
A8 is stronger than A7 so it's not a
pure check it actually prefers blocking
for the same reasons that I just
explained and 70% Equity 78% Equity
apparently that's where it starts to
flip a bit and it's actually start to
worth 3 quarters let me add those here
it's just on the threshold a 78 so
basically let's say it's in the 80%
region 80% region also has a clear
preference it no longer wants to block
okay it's worth more so again it's an
example we're just betting the strength
of our hand it's worth 3/4 so what do we
bet 3/4 in general you have your value
size because there's value hands that
are incentive to bet that sizing that's
why we that's why a 75% rolled out
because we have a lot of these 80% type
of equity handset want to bet 75% okay
clear action profile a jack rarely to
never wants to check because it just
loses so much value from all the 7x some
8X some 5x that are going to check
behind that would call a bet only if
your opponent is extremely over bluffing
but I'm getting ahead of myself then
maybe we could consider checking it or
like I said based on certain kickers but
in general when we get to higher types
of equity the 780 has a very clear
profile which is Block in the 80 to 90
is a very clear profile which is too bad
medium now if we go up this is actually
see where it gets complicated because
now you would say well if it was check
block three quarters now we're just
going to overb right but now suddenly we
see a bit of everything King Jack 91%
Equity has a very clear action profile
where should the value come from with
King Jack betting an overb and getting
max value out of nines 10 eight a worst
Jacka that's apparently what king Jack
is worth now again the ace is checking
for the reason that I explained and
maybe Ace Jack can also check rates and
this is where
basically the the confusion comes in
with all these hands that suddenly do a
bit of everything once we reach a
certain amount of equity which I think
is like 95% in this case we can suddenly
play our hand in all types of ways now
why is that if you have a very strong
hand obviously you could overb you make
a lot of money that way but when you
check and your opponent check bets our
hand is that strong that we can now
check race okay so we actually gain a
lot of value as well by checking if if
we block and villain raises and we have
the nuts we can bet three bet all in so
there's various ways if we have a 95%
plus Equity hand to get our money in so
there's less of a clear action profile
compared to a jack a jack will not check
raise if it checks so there's no added
benefit it will not block three bet if
it blocks so there's a very clear action
profile because of the amount of equity
that it has all right now again we saw
that with these very strong hands we saw
the blocker properties playing in mainly
pocket sevens clearly wants to check
because it has less downsides because
the main downside of checking is that a
7x checks behind but we have two sevens
so it's less likely that he has a seven
so there's less downsides so therefore
we check whereas 910 has less of these
properties so you can see it just mixes
a bit of everything okay and it just
makes sure that in every line which is
it is important in practice but
especially in a solver you have to
realize that your opponent can see your
strategy it's a transparent strategy so
it has to be perfectly balanced and
therefore it just puts a little bit of
nuts in all the sizings so all sizings
are protected okay and in certain hands
because of certain properties have a
preference for clearly a big overb like
five2 clearly just wants to overb and
that's because if we have five du maybe
check R is a bit on the thin side or
block three but is maybe a bit on the
thin side and if we have a five in a
deuce he has more 7x 8X 9x which 9x 10x
jackx which could call an overb
so very clear action profile for the
five du and the B three betat all in is
clearly reserved for the nuts nuts nuts
right 99.9% Equity guess the other hands
are also not 99.9% Equity therefore B
three ble win could maybe be a bit too
expensive so I hope this makes sense I
think it's very clear that based on the
strength of our hands we want to do
certain things okay now to finish it up
I wanted to quickly talk about the
Bluffs the Bluffs also again you will
see not a very clear action profile but
the purpose of these Bluffs is they're
just also being distributed amongst the
sizings so that no sizing is unbalanced
so every sizing has some nuts every
sizing has some Bluffs therefore in
position is not
incentivized to do something drastically
different okay if one line would never
have Bluffs obviously your opponent is
no longer incentivized to pay off and
your value would suffer okay so that's
the reason why basically Bluffs just go
all over the place certain Bluffs might
have specific pafic um specific profiles
why it wants to bet overb for example
king queen clearly wants to overb if it
does something that's probably because
King Jack and queen Jack are definitely
in the checkback line on the turn quite
often and they will always call an overb
so mainly mainly I guess blocker
properties play with the king queen all
right now the second thing to take in
consideration in where your value has to
come from is who is my opponent and then
mainly looking at their tendencies in
terms of aggression and willingness to
fold to give you an example the more
aggressive your opponent the more your
value should usually come from checking
towards him and letting him Bluff
whereas if your opponent Bluffs less and
it is more on the passive side usually
your value should be gained by getting C
instead of getting Bluff because it's
not the type of opponent that will do a
lot of bluffing if we check towards him
let's continue on the same example as
before and look at different profiles
and how our strategy will change now in
order to answer this question I switched
to Pio because it's customizable with
nolock function which we're going to be
needing in this example actually injo
wizard is going to be coming up very
soon as well but we basically see the
same things in the Pio example as in the
GTO wizard example even though it might
not be exactly the same ranges sevens is
still the hand to check same with A7 and
eight still wants to block King Jack
still wants to over bat 910 still wants
to do a bit of everything so basically
it's the same thing so now we're
wondering well what if we Face a more
more aggressive opponent what will
change if we look at if we check our
opponent is betting 38% of the time and
if it has
air we go to Range Explorer and we say
air which I guess is nothing in this
case I guess King High could also be
nothing so if it has air it's in a
balanced strategy allow to bet that air
56% of the time this is his bluff
allowance as we say so what if our
opponent has nothing and just always BL
Bluffs how would that impact our
strategy so if we look at our current
strategy we're checking 42% of the time
okay and betting small 22% of the time
now let's go to the no loock
function and say that our opponent has
nothing and you know your opponent is
like well can't win if you check so
let's just uh never check let's just
always Bluff now he is confusing yes you
will statistically win the pot more
often if you bet than if you won't but
he's confusing trying to win the pot
with making the highest EV decision now
obviously if your opponent is over
folding by arm always Bluff but in the
equilibrium uh it is this case not the
case we're not allowed to Bluff
everything in uh as in position we were
actually allowed to Bluff everything as
out of position that everything to do
with the fact that we check folded all
of our air and in position as seed all
this air on the Flop so basically just
by check calling out of position and the
turn seven being very improving for a
range we get to bet all the air that we
arrive to the river with so we lock the
strategy save
close already it's going to take only a
second so where should our value come
from we had strength of our hand and now
based on the Tendencies of our opponent
in this case vain is more aggressive now
what do we see
instead of O I don't recall exactly but
I think we're checking around 20% more
and mainly the small bet starts to
disappear and this is a very important
point this is also why I highlighted how
often are we betting small because you
can see now the
7x that I think was the threshold for
Value betting if you recall it was like
sometimes betting sometimes checking
because both EVS were very close well
now if we check towards in position he's
over bluffing so the EV is no longer
close checking to induce Bluffs because
V is aggressive or over bluffing is now
clearly making more money than um than
if we would be betting ourselves okay
same with the adex it's mainly going to
be like these lower EV hands that
clearly now just want to be checking and
inducing Bluffs as you can see if we
have Jack 10 which is worth 3/4
basically everything that was worth
three quars to begin with is not
checking to induce Bluffs okay that's
not where it Valu should come from based
on the strength of IT hand now there is
a point okay where your opponent is
going to be so over bluffing and so or
in general so betting so often that we
can basically just bet check everything
but you have to realize that then if
you're wrong and if your opponent's not
over bluffing it costs you more money
with Jack 10 than it would cost you with
108 makes sense now another adjustment
that we're going to make is then when
your opponent bats as you can see we're
never folding because if our hand wasn't
good enough to
be um to be calling a bet we would have
beted ourselves because our Bluff
allowance was 100% we were always
bluffing the only hand that checks and
sometimes wins it Showdown that doesn't
always want to Bluff was the king queen
remember that was the hand that wanted
to overb because all the 5x now gained
value and the 7x also gained value now
the 5x we were already checking so
basically nothing really changed the
fact that we always calling but it's
mainly the 7x and 8x that now has gained
EV because of the Tendencies of our
opponent now this is a river example but
this concept will apply on every street
the reason why we're for example as
initial razor on the Flop or turn while
we're C betting okay it's because we
want to get money in the pot if your
opponent's very aggressive in probing
then checking towards him letting him
bet and moving a lot of your bets to the
check race that's a way that we can get
money in the pot all right so if your
opponent does all the aggression for you
there's usually less downside in
checking and therefore you know we can
gain where should our value come from
while checking and letting the guy build
a pot so we can build an even bigger pot
after that now on the flip side we also
have more passive opponents for that
actually I also included the mimat uh
and we can see what I what I mentioned
earlier 107 was a check King s was a
check uh now they became a mimat and
basically we're just moving down even
pocket sixes now sometimes throw the m
bet usually just the smaller you bet the
more you can bet for Value basically the
lower you can go down the equity so what
happens if our opponent instead of being
too aggressive is going to be too
passive well if we go
again so instead of nothing 41% of the
time he's like ah he's never falling I'm
never bluffing I'm just always going to
check now the main difference you're are
going to see in this kind of scenarios
is that the smallest sizings will start
to disappear okay and that's because
small sizings in general are already
close to check and the EV of check has
just gone up now why has the EV of check
gone up well basically if we check and
our opponent is not bluffing all the
time especially with his King highs Ace
highs whatever 3/4s we basically always
get to fold all right there's no more
incentive also if we look at our Str
strong hand at seven wizard pure check
simply because if we check he's not
going to bet often enough now in the
river example uh especially with this
hands like a 7x a weak 8X they become
very clear checks mainly the seven and
some 8X these are the hands that gain EV
when people are under bluffer now
mainly on earlier streets let's say flop
and turn I think this is very important
because inducing versus someone who's
not bluffing thing that's usually not
really a great idea right if you're
trying to play based on where should my
value come from and if you have some
reach on your opponent and he's more of
the passive type and starting to induce
certain hands it's not really going to
add you a lot of value they're usually
passive so just check your weaker hands
to him he's going to bet which is fine
you can just fold your weaker hands
because he's not going to Bluff this is
how you exploit more passive opponents
at your tables so your value in this
gamee should come from checking more
weaker hands towards your opponent and
when he bets you simply are going to
fold it's as simple as that so with the
explanations out of the way now we're
going to be jumping into a live play and
explain session where I'm really going
to be focusing in on where should my
value come from let's go okay got two
tables of
tunl if you haven't seen my previous
video that I made about what's this
range definitely go check that out it
will be kind of the same concept only
this time we will be focused on where
should my value come from now there
might be some situations where obviously
I will highlight again like oh what is
his range because obviously his range
will also determine where our value has
to come from um I won't be I don't know
this pool very well so I don't think I'm
going to make huge adjustment based on
player types but if there's a certain
situation where I feel like oh versus a
specific player profile I would
definitely choose a specific action with
a hand I will definitely highlight that
before we start quickly mechanics of
Poker 2.0 we're currently open to
receive new applications new students
for our program if you want to work
together with me and Adam make more
progress in your poker career one of the
most complete poker coaching programs on
the market this week I think up until
the 7th of September you can apply after
that we will close again so you want to
get the chance to work with me and Adam
apply now without further Ado let's get
into the pool
and put an extra focus on where should
my value come from and this can
be mainly depending on a couple of value
uh couple of Tendencies we already
talked about the range that we're
facing we talked a lot about in the
intro to this video about the strength
of our
hand and also we talked about the
Tendencies of our opponent these are
usually kind of the the three
main to consider and I've taged a lot
but these tags are probably going to be
on the older side don't know how
reliable they're going to
be N I think it easy go here through a
three B on the
button Queen highboard I I believe on a
queen
highboard
we get to Pew
this it's an ay board or oh he goes half
poot where half poot I think it's close
without a club to be honest 6
s very
close we can turn straight draws on a
six a seven a 10 and a jack that's why I
still call but 100% sure here Jacky
board probably going to be somewhere
between 13 and half po I'll go 40%
that's usually if I'm in doubt like what
it's going to be I'll I'll choose that
it goes check on the turn bit weird
where should my value come from don't
think value betting here is going to be
appropriate he will definitely pot
control the turn there's not a lot of
adex I think that will half pot so we
should probably start with checking then
decide if we should uh Bluff catch here
suits are going to be very important in
these type of scenarios we playing a
Three Pot in quite tight
formations so having like removal and
blockers and stuff have a very big
impact on theault Equity so the queen
is okay but the King of Diamond is quite
bad because he could have floated king
queen of diamonds for example and I
don't block any
Suited
King
X definitely B Bing here on the River of
course I chose to go for a half pot
sizing simply because we are probably
more on the Capp side
so he does indeed go for the check race
we don't I mean we block one Queen Jack
which I guess is good Main blov
are going to just have to be pocket
pairs but five sixes so it's going to be
like something like pocket eights that
he has to turn into a
bluff
how the problem is on the river if I had
good suits that would block the Jack axe
I would have most likely barreled so on
the river we're probably actually left
with just a lot of bad
hands uh to
call the
river check
race here with the 84 actually in
hindsight I check quite fast I wouldn't
have M A
Lead but I think it's a bit more
appropriate on on an eight or nine
press sure value come from with the
eight definitely not value betting it's
in the lower bracket in terms of equity
so it's going to be a check and then
deciding versus B check bet if we should
call or
not which I would
say queen four king four
King 10 actually going to f
but going to go for forit here with the
King
Jack I'm actually curious what the guy
had with nines
earlier he had ace4
Spades with a small
bat
the king Jack probably spot where we're
going to do a lot
of double and maybe triple
barreling this for example is a turn we
we just get to apply so much pressure
because he will have some proportion of
it's like sixes sevens eights nines
which we don't have so basically I would
say we can see that range on both
streets so where should their value come
from basically we're utilizing our
Equity Advantage by putting l of
pressure because we have this equity
advant we force him to do a lot of
folding on all
streets now on the River where should
our value come
[Music]
from getting CAU or getting
bluffed kind of
depends can also go
middle
when I'm in doubt between where should
the value come from getting called or
getting Bluff sometimes I go in the
middle like
this here I think I'm going to
overb think he pretty
capped
oh right
well gem indeed felt a bit close so then
it's a question of do
we do we
check and then juce a bluff of
like a flush
draw a Miss flush
draw but then we probably miss value out
of
the the ace Jack and Ace Queen of Heart
type of holding
LS or maybe like and like pocket
Queens
try he's just going to have a worst King
quite
often
or do we check and let
him let's say did
PE n twice or eights let him turn that
into a bluff on the river but like I
said then we
[Music]
lose value against as6 Hearts but is as6
going to
call given the way the board runs out
it's very hard for us to show with love
of BL most probably have to turn like
queens or jacks or something into a
bluff so yeah it's uh it's an
interesting
spot here versus recreational I
believe just going to Barrel the scary
King hope
he that is the very Advanced strategy
[Music]
here and hope something scary comes in
the river it doesn't I think I'm just
going to give
up
set good give
up yeah very interesting
spot king queen now this is also a very
interesting spot in terms of where
should a value come
from here I would definitely play
different based
on the opponent that I'm
[Music]
playing so different Tendencies of your
opponent will definitely change
strategies here going to go for the
default
GTO go from
there because I don't know who this guy
is I would say GTO is just going to
check a lot and from the big blind and
definitely this is going to be a check
call
good turn obviously if you had Queen
Jack no wi check check I think on the
river we have to check
again can call three
bet
I don't mind a check race to be honest
with my exact
hand here on the Flop I'm going to play
Big bet check I think five for hearts is
fine to go in the big bet this guy is
thinking about it I have a feeling he
has he was thinking about sizing that's
what
it very weird
Ely going to go right
here don't mind
that
Queen the PO kind of throws me off a
little bit I have to say
going to f simply because he better a
pot if you would have better just like
quote quote normal three
quars I guess I would have called
because pot is if you just look at
average population pot is going to be an
unfrequent
sizing so people then put in bit more
f
and now we're on the river I'm going to
jam the 54 hope he doesn't have a better
hand here the nin actually I'm going to
go for a check again a board
that is very similar as the other board
which are very you can definitely play
different depending on the Tendencies of
your
opponent the only thing that I the king
queen hand is really weird because the
line makes very little sense especially
given the fact that I have the King of
Diamonds like I said the puppet kind of
threw me
off so it's a more unfrequent ju sizing
if you just look at globally opulation
let's say for example 3/4 is probably
going to be six times more likely or
something six times more used than a pot
bat then
usually my general experience would say
that pot then is stronger now obviously
you know if you play more versus
people it's always interesting if if an
uncommon sizing is used somewhere
between 80 to
105 it's always a good idea to try to
pay attention to what this sizing is
meaning
[Music]
n10 11.5
big let me know what you guys think the
line makes no sense s in my opinion but
uh the size it kind of threw me off the
54 I think kind of played itself on turn
we could also
check but yeah I check if you could also
over and then the river I think the
river we have to just jam it
in but I think I played that
hand
well
the turn I think you
will like these type of hands like a
bottom pair type if is
hand should definitely be in your
strategy if you look at range
constructions you want to have some sort
of low pairs usually in the in the range
so he if you would only bat a king Axe
and draws for example a hand like Ace
Queen on the king 105 or Ace Jack
General as have flush draws and Stu they
they increase a lot in their EV in
calling and a middle pair like a
10 has a
very has an easier uh
fold this probably actually a full
onum
but
um off is probably also closed but hey
we're in position this time not folding
here
so yeah by basically adding like some of
these lower pairs in your barreling
range it becomes becomes a bit less
clear for the defender which hand is
better Ace queen or a
10 we Face a check here on this board
going to go for a small bet here with
the
65 now you could say okay we can also
then use this hand but I think this hand
is a bit too strong to
bet so if you want to apply the same
concept you would probably pick a hand
like poad deces with a heart or
something to overb on the turn can put
way more pressure on a
six get called by like the Ace King and
the H Queen with a
heart
a lot of it is as well like Bluff
prevention in both scenarios let's say
you had Deuces here on the turn or the
5x let's say it goes check check and he
bets the river something is going to get
bluffed and I'm definitely not biting
the
river okay so he had Ace eight with a
heart so he could then also ask himself
the same question where should my value
come
from with the Ada hearts and an ace that
to get called or Bluff
catched here on the king 104
twoone play small b as well but I like
to play Big bet sport it's quite close
King them or if it was king queen 4 I
would definitely play a big b check if
was King 10 six I would definitely play
a big b check so now it's up for you
guys to figure out what was
theistic so those are the boards where I
would have a clear preference but on
that board I don't really
have can go either way
here with the ace Jack I'm checking it
down in hindsight I think actually a
turnover B is quite
good you can put quite a lot of pressure
on like lower Pairs and he's going to
call you with the other a highs
obviously checking is
not
awful I think checking Ace King and then
betting Ace jack on a turn for an over
bet I think is good so where should his
value come from with the a 8 e at the
eight of
Hearts but he could obviously value B
for my 6X that I had or like a 9x that I
bet check or a 10x that I
revert and your hand is not that strong
that you're going to go for a check race
so like the Ace of Hearts you had that
then by all means check because you can
check rate so it gains a lot of evv that
way I would say The Jacka hearts
also I would probably now check back it
kind of depends if I would check back
Deuces with a heart for
example probably probably not actually
but also I could have rivered a straight
with 78 so actually I think his his
check is not great with the Ace of
Hearts eight of Hearts particularly I
think he should just
bat uh so then you could ask well is
this maybe then an exploitive check to
let me stab something random
now I could see that that he's just uh
doing that from an exploitive
perspective we're going to check back
some hands and your other card is going
to be very important I think the Ace of
Hearts definitely the ace of hearts or
an ace in general but especially the ace
of hearts and the Ace of space are going
to make for checks on the turn I would
never check Queen Jack I think or these
I would be unlikely less likely to check
back Queen
Jack cuz then he has more Aces he has
more AI flush draws stuff like
that also interesting from his side now
where should his value come
from should he
bet that's 10% I like that so when
you're in doubt between what what you're
going to do I really like 10% I'm
actually going to just call this with
the Ace of
Hearts because there's less so he
doesn't have the ace high flush that I
can now get value from or Aces so if I
would have checked back Queen Jack or
queen ten I would definitely just uh
would definitely race but I think this
hand is just a
call hi guys Renee AKA Deo here with a

poker.com and apply for the program and
maybe you will get a chance to work with
me and Adam and make more progress in
your poker
career too bad the pool is a bit short
so we don't have lot of epmp situations
let's say we were under the gun versus
the big blind sometimes I'll use I won't
have Jack but uh it's actually an okay
hand to use as a bluff in tighter
formations whereas in cut off I think we
have a check and usually a full to
aggression in experience 910 I think we
have a pretty easy check back on the
Flop to kind of protect our checkback
range so it's not only High cards
then had like
910 n Jack I really like
personally check again on the
turn step on the Flop here with 37 I
thought we had it feels like I always
already have a straight to be
honest I was looking at the Flop and I
was like I have a straight um I don't
have a kicker
here should I still
race see then we probably want to raise
something so if kicker doesn't play then
I let's say I had no I don't have that I
definitely can have a check pack a I'm
just going to
call you guys ready check
race
it's I don't mind throwing out of
FL
n
huh had
it he had it and we rivered him
nice so I was looking if that would
apply but I think I'm going to be
checking back flop turn
with enough still ace high that I don't
re and like I said my
nine my nine doesn't block let's say had
suited or 95 Suited I think raising is
fine this close but probably at least
one with pocket eights this also close
but I decided to call here with
D9 checks I think we have no business
betting this one is quite interesting I
don't mind a block three bat actually
pretty
and here we're just checking it down
hope he doesn't have a nine with Val
that luckily we didn't very
better got a full there with the a I
think that
that well played on this
River so I I showed an example in the
theory where we would have three
different sizes and that was because I
chose a run out that we had the equity
advantage and usually when you have the
equity Advantage you're not really
restricted in terms of sizings that you
can use here however the King was very
good for him on the river and it's a
flush complete if he construct his range
well he will definitely check back some
flush on the turn now obviously we then
back to the first video that I made in
this little two-part series if he
doesn't have any flusher that check
going to turn obviously that changes
things but I think this is a spot where
I would usually start with block I guess
there's maybe some specific hands that
would have Mind Over betting like a
set this again actually I think is also
an interesting hand in terms of where
should my value come from the more
aggressive your opponent is the more I
would lean towards check the more
passive your opponent is the more I
would lean towards
bat I don't know this guy so I just uh
rnged it that's uh kind of the solution
here we have the Queen of Diamonds which
I guess would be an okay bet I'm
actually going to check twice low again
so this
is
this is pretty pretty
Yol uh let me see did we win with the
ace
Queen a n versus MP probably
B so any hand that is a that is a roll
or RNG means that they are
close then if we have no information
about our opponent or about our
population then by all means you know
roll
away because there's that's kind of the
whole idea right there's
no one line that's better than the other
but as soon as we gain information all
these hands that are closed they are no
longer closed there is actually a clear
answer so by all means like I said in
this situation if I was with a screen
versus a passive opponent
why would you check back a queen to
first of all in juice that makes no
sense because you're inducing nothing
but he's passive and second of all why
would you protect versus someone who's
passive if he would attack check backs
he would not be passive so say sometimes
people say I'm not going to exploit the
fact that he's passive because if I
would not check back a queen he could
start being aggressive but the guy is
passive and the guy wakes up and he's
like today I'm going to play poker and
I'm going to play Passive it's not like
oh but forsus this guy he doesn't check
back Ace Queen um [ __ ] uh what was it
a74 so versus him specifically I'm going
to be aggressive but normally I'm
passive no doesn't work like that so we
don't have to we you you can take a more
exploitive approach and don't have to be
so paranoid
about the the possible readjustments
that they can make and in the end your
your game will be balanced
okay if you think about if you are
concerned about that because sometimes
you play versus an aggressive opponent
and you always check back Ace Queen for
example and if you play ver a passive
opponent you will just never back check
back Ace Queen but that's kind of how it
works um this spot can kind of
go
sixes the higher my Paris I think this
one's pretty
close
check and in the end then you're set
will balance and even your own stats
let's say and this actually most
probably true let's say you flavors a
majority pass of opponents this actually
works in your favor so you check back
weaker ranges to full turn because
you're playing into the fact that he's
passive so basically it doesn't matter
that you check back weak in full term
because he doesn't construct enough
blust in his range anyway that makes
sense but I wanted to come full circle
you play versus the pool that's overly
passive this is actually great CU every
time you're just checking you're folding
turns and then
suddenly okay then suddenly you play
versus aggressive opponent he sees you
maybe also as foldy on the turn but
versus him you check back a completely
different range so it actually would
play in your advantage so some examples
of where should my value come from give
give denes of
[Music]
myON
check race check is pretty sexy can we
have n we can
definitely yeah I feel
like the eight will probably have enough
Showdown V to at least start with check
and I think if he bets I'm going to jam
cuz he will never have 910 and we can
easily have
here the suits are quite nice too
bad
I'm a little bit little bit YOLO
here this guy just sat down I've played
zero hands with
him normally I would indicate this as a
sign of strength but if it's the
firstand someone played it can also just
be a SP guy
I'm maybe so SP that he not just Champs
should maybe
reconsider um king queen suited I think
one of the hands that I would call most
of the
time the hand that clearly prefers
calling going to check this flop
Recreation raise way more on the Flop
and I don't want to bfold this
hand king
queen who probably delad this
sometimes let's do that
now going to go for the check again for
the same reasons explained earlier
probably going to check
call maybe leading Ace or something play
he raises I think we have actually I
think we might have a call to be honest
with king queen this is okay guys this
is going to be very funky
okay
uh oh where should value come
from probably now leading out
ourselves would
say good thing that fishes they can
still do something funky but when when
he bet three big BLS on a turn I think
he can have a six or a nine so I think
checking on the river is a mistake you
should just always block
because especially for recreationals but
in general block is kind
of it's close between both option block
is probably the line that gets both the
that te Val out of a six or sevens eight
nine that he's going to check behind and
it will he will still pass race so I
would happily call a gem D vers
recreational I think it's a important
lead if you if you check there on the
river you're you're not not thinking
about where your V should come from giv
the strength of your
hand
recreational I just bet smaller versus
recreational but I can see big betting
as
well and I wanted to come back to my
king queen because people are not like w
go going to explain this [ __ ] king
queen here I'm actually going to barrel
turn
think obviously I would prefer to have a
club
but I think also without a club it's
just good unblockers to the folding
range he will sometimes call with worse
king T with a with a club for example
some BL prevention he will have way more
5x and random jack8 off suit
then
actually going to check where should Val
come from quite close this one but I
feel like
recreationals if you
check then often something can happen
like for example what happened
now King
Jack close he did make it
10 did we do something
random no just is King but I feel like
checking back for his Recreation there
is a bit better than betting simply
because they can just start blasting way
so where should J come from getting C or
getting bluffed I would say ver his
recreational is more often getting
bluffed
Jack
call on at least
flop and probably turn as well I think
King Jack is probably better than
ace5
so
I probably coing Jack he checks which
you do quite a
lot check as
well Bluff should now probably come from
sixes sevens eights but he should
probably also start bluffing that on the
turn quite often simply just
unblockers
that'ss [ __ ] the king n sua that's
good definitely going to call this some
of the
time
yeah nice and nice hand nice
hand so I thought the three quarter
sizing is a bit more
polarizing since both players are going
to check quite strong on turn I don't
think ace5 suited or something for examp
is worth three quarters
it's easy to have 54 suited 5 six suited
pocket sixes pocket Sev pocket
eights try to Bluff me of King Jack so I
would say it's
fine 10
[Music]
Jack guys been getting
way let's see what he got uh oh we could
be getting in
the in dicey
territory come on just bu me rip it
in
p uh 10 checks while we
do we block tens and
Jacks with a
diamond probably probably we're getting
ourselves in messy
territory
B probably give up we want him to
probably have tens and
Jacks or is he actually going to call T
and Jacks guess tens and Jack actually
probably going to give
up there's no off combos of a queen a
Jack or something in his range that he's
always going to fall The River guess he
could fold
eight it good thing that we gave up
then
um let's try it again with Ace King
maybe playing for b bs with Ace King is
better this is actually also an
interesting hand in terms of where
should my value come from Flav is a very
passive opponent I don't think we can
check fold our hand it's too strong so I
would sa as a passive opponent I would
just
block and normally but my normal would
be check with
range
is and again since we don't really know
him going to
check okay where should my value come
from
probably temping against
an does he ever have the
nuts huh probably
not if he ra
raes he doesn't really have off suit I
guess he can have Ace
King but that's onlyou
of how much is that five big blinds
that's a lunch that's lunch thank you
that's
lunch is
10 unlucky
buddy all right well playing what do we
learn in this video you should play for
pots with Ace King suited instead of
T here check call where should our value
come from probably not bluffing we're
too high up so start with a check and
then
decide if we should Bluff catch the 10
is pretty good I think to Bluff catch I
think a lot of the 10x that he has going
to barrel turn n 10 Queen
n there's more so you should probably
have something like Queen exuded King ex
suited I don't mind this as a bluff
catch
close
CL we're also running out of time bank
would have liked to had a bit more time
there um Ace
Queen Ace
Queen can probably check race sometimes
or check
call go for a check
race because we're in an aggressive
mood getting ourselves in some dice
situation
uh no rethinking about the asent is
probably horrible you have pocket threes
pocket fours they do the best job in
unblocking
everything
so just theault I would say is uh is the
correct
Play Because also on a club like you see
let's say let's say the ter was a
spade so not the flush complete then I
would have liked my call but I think on
the flush complete he going to check
back more I mean the hand that he had
Jack Queen and then I think uh the check
back range can become a little bit too
unbalanced and then I think we can
definitely call the
river 4 six 7 8 n yeah
stabbing 95 like the bat over bat forc
to fold 95 I think 6 7 8 9 10 yeah 9 10
is uh definitely [ __ ] me
over
check king is not great is
it going to Barrel this some of the time
I'm not really
sure on a 98 I will Barrel
it would have preferred an eight or nine
what are you thinking about Buddy [ __ ]
my
life [ __ ] my life now we probably have
to get it
in you could have eight
nines probably going to fold have no
clubs block
Kings
I'm going to wrap it up think there were
definitely some spots where we talked
enough about where should come from
based on the strength of our
hand based on some opponent's
Tendencies based on certain Equity
advantages
disadvantages we did
actually mention some of that
