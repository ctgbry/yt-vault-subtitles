[00:00]
because we wanted to flop flush over
flush versus knee to my tree that was
the lamp
oh don't we need to mature he's thinking
about it that means he probably has
pocket force
oh we have at least one flush he bets
again this guy's a little bit
funky yeah

[00:15]
sorry i'm telling you this guy is out of
the
out of his head
[Music]

so you don't miss out on any new
promotions let's start with a little
little little little better with the
eight nights a little bit juicy
juice juicy see

[01:01]
we see we are blocking like some two
pairs
which actually isn't bad
we might actually get to bluff this
sometimes

[01:17]
[Music]
we have a gutter for what it's worth no
it's worth [ __ ]
it's not completely true but we do have
a good bluff
if the board pairs like now

[01:59]
and he falls so that's the first first

[02:01]
and he falls so that's the first first
part from mr weko
i don't blame him and people like gloves
there but we are
crazy in the head as i say
let me see do we make a vector straight

[02:15]
let me see do we make a vector straight
not really but i do think still on a
three
a four or five we turn a gutter don't we
wow i'm really not sure
ace deuce five three no we don't
so i'm just gonna actually i think i

[02:32]
so i'm just gonna actually i think i
still want to check race
you will not have a lot of uh good
category bluffs on these type of
textures
so i do actually think ace deuce is a
candidate that you can
start adding and i think

[02:48]
start adding and i think
unimproved i'm just gonna check fold the
turn
no i'm actually gonna go for the block
i'm saying i'm saying things but then i
changed my mind
and it works so i'm a genius i'm a

[03:00]
and it works so i'm a genius i'm a
genius
i'm a genius
i face a little little three bet here
i'm gonna go for a call
miko i'm actually probably okay now
check raising getting in
in with this again it's a bit

[03:16]
in with this again it's a bit
disappointable
it's a bit dicey but i'm still gonna do
it like obviously you know king jack for

[03:30]
it like obviously you know king jack for
example would be a better hand but you
know
yeah cannot have it all
and then also he has less king x random
king x bluffs to choose from
and now what do we do i think we just

[03:45]
and now what do we do i think we just
ship it in and go to bed
if he has access he has aces oh he
turned five nine suited
that was the other thing
actually the 9x does really improve him
maybe we should just check range

[04:00]
maybe we should just check range
yeah that was quite unlucky yeah can i
even play in this game i mean what the
[ __ ]
they find oh i mean what the
i mean how can i even play in this game
it's like i just get
cheated i mean hand after hand after

[04:15]
cheated i mean hand after hand after
hand
five nine suited it's also quite frisky
great risky son i would tell you this
much son i would never have put more
3000 with two tons
oh here we go i was gonna say okay i'm
i'm tired of these people pushing me
around i'm gonna make a four bet

[04:30]
around i'm gonna make a four bet
i've had it there you go
you see
sure pisses me off though goddammit i
always i'm convinced the bastards are
pushing me around
i'm just convinced that the son of a

[04:46]
i'm just convinced that the son of a
[ __ ] is pushing me around
you see i told you the passes are
pushing me around
like a little forward there with the ice
king
and now we already warmed them up with
the other forward with the king seven

[05:01]
the other forward with the king seven
we warmed him up
[Music]
i'm starting with a check
and probably gonna call

[05:25]
and probably gonna call
28 is paid which i think is an okay card

[05:30]
28 is paid which i think is an okay card
he barrels i think i'm gonna call again
with the a space i don't think he's
barreling much ace of spades or betting
me
of spades so in this
case i would actually prefer to have the
ace of spades at a space i'm talking
about space but obviously i mean hearts

[05:45]
about space but obviously i mean hearts
that's not a good river
he had ten nine
versus 109 we did had have two life
cards hey man enjoy your streams very

[06:00]
cards hey man enjoy your streams very
much how many
hands should a midstage player 500 plus
player pay per month as a professional
they're like 25 000. i think that's
you know you're a full-time professional
player i think that's a good
good striving

[06:17]
also don't also don't recommend people
we've also played a bit too much
sometimes um
and i think that's also not uh not great
okay we have six four well if he has an
over pair we are going to be

[06:33]
over pair we are going to be
yes flipping probably going to get the
money you know
six five nine ten yeah that would be a
shitty run out
eight ten would also be a shitty run out
yeah this was gonna happen quite often

[06:45]
yeah this was gonna happen quite often
now we're gonna race
i'm gonna flip first overpass but we
hope that
he found a bluff about six five
it's a very good hand so you know what
time it is guys
you know what time it is wait

[07:00]
you know what time it is wait
just jimmy everyone knows what time it
is i'm like
wait he's gonna now see why are you
waiting where the [ __ ] is my clip
yeah we kind of ship it in and go to bed
time to go ship it and go to bed
oh we we made him sweat for a little

[07:15]
oh we we made him sweat for a little
while so that's nice
king jack let's go for a call
could sometimes bet this but we wrote
quite a low number so i'm not going to

[07:30]
quite a low number so i'm not going to
this time
checks again now we probably want to bet
if we have something with a heart
so i would say this one goes in the
check again
and now the river probably we get to
bluff this

[07:48]
but i don't really have a great feeling
about it
i'm just gonna give up actually i'm
giving myself the chicken sound we
actually chop
okay but i will give myself the chicken
song

[08:02]
[Music]
i know i wasn't really feeding it spot
this spot
get three bets face a c bet

[08:16]
that's uh yeah i'm not really in love
with that spot
to say yeah i'd say the least he's
barreling i'm gonna
fault i think
yeah and this guy being a little bit

[08:31]
yeah and this guy being a little bit
knitty
don't but 33 okay he's not that netty
dunbar three three is king drew but okay
so he's a little bit crazy actually in
the head
okay now we're gonna go broke that's how
fast those things can turn around huh

[08:48]
at some crazy people note here
offbot now that's good if he has if he
has better at let's get the discount no
he just
barrels off ace king let me quickly
change my tag i thought he was someone

[09:00]
change my tag i thought he was someone
else
but it was someone else but apparently
he is do you want to have a better
understanding of what's going on in
these videos in our mechanics of poker

strategy

how poker really works
and how to get more success in poker so
do you want over 30k
dollar worth of value go over to the
site and join our mechanics of poker
program this guy here

[09:31]
program this guy here
thanks wanna [ __ ] with me let's get it
in with the ace king
let's go oh in ace king guys oh
in ace king we're all in versus pocket
queens
five

[09:49]
we missed how can we miss we flopped 108
a lot of draws to to choose from on this
board a lot of them are open enders

[10:00]
like eight nine for example but still
this end is probably better than uh
and 109 i would say so i guess i would
have check raised this at a certain
frequency
and that's what we do

[10:17]
and that's what we do
me see what shall we
go for a little blocky then he raises
and then we're gonna review the true

[10:32]
and then we're gonna review the true
strength
of our hand
that's the strategy
yes yes yes like i just said

[10:47]
i'm gonna make that around 37.5 to go
i think 37.5 seems like a good sizing
let's pump it up guys snapchats and mugs

[11:04]
let's pump it up guys snapchats and mugs
[Music]
we are 500 nl zoom superstars

[11:16]
we are 500 nl zoom superstars
that's what we are what did he have
pocket knights
should we have maybe went bigger

[11:30]
it's an interesting dilemma there's a
bet here for mr big joe
what am i gonna do i think i'm just
gonna go for that
it's time to ship it in and go to bed

[11:48]
defaults okay guys with pocket queens
and this is why we forgot bluffer
to make them a little bit warm before we
bluff bluffton with the kingfish suited
and now he's like these bastards are
pushing me around

[12:01]
i'm gonna go for the for the three bed
because
interesting turn

[12:19]
it sounds quite dicey so we do it jam
or do we block think actually we jam

[12:30]
i think we jam
nine's queen oh that's one dead
oh no that would have also it would have
also been too much so
to be fair there's a seabed here i'm
gonna go for a little crazy raisin

[12:48]
big stealer calls
we have the jack of spades

[13:18]
hmm
he had queen nine
learn him in lured him in guys we lured
him
in take notes take note

[13:31]
in take notes take note
and here we also did something funky we
opened and we called
a squeeze because we wanted to flop
flush over flush versus knee to my tree
that was the lamp
oh don't need to mature he's thinking

[13:46]
oh don't need to mature he's thinking
about it that means he probably has
pocket force
oh we have at least one flush
he bets again this guy's a little bit

[14:00]
funkier
sorry
i'm telling you this guy is out of the

[14:15]
i'm telling you this guy is out of the
out of his head
here i made it through the queens decide
to check the flop as we are a little bit
deeper
and the board is two-toned i'm gonna
call
i'm gonna check the turn

[14:33]
scooter was a very high techno band
scooter yeah i remember scooters
screaming in his mic
and one of these old school mics right
he loved to use
exceeded checks river eight is like

[14:48]
exceeded checks river eight is like
quite a good card for my range
just as it's the seventh oh
wait i misread the board okay

[15:01]
i misread the board i didn't see it was
double paired
then i don't think i should have been
betting now now it's gonna be
interesting
yeah obviously he's folding would if
we would have now raised i should have

[15:16]
we would have now raised i should have
checked i didn't see it was double
paired
that's what you get if you're doing
multiple things in the same time
okay we face it three bets i'm actually
just gonna call and let this guy do
something funky
because this is the will

[15:31]
and i think i'm just gonna continue that
plan even though i'm a little bit
tempted to already raise on this board
as to you know it's quite that's quite
some connectivity but
i think just letting him do his thing is
probably the best idea
now on the turn like i said for the same

[15:48]
now on the turn like i said for the same
reason that i said on the flop that it's
quite
unlike quite hard to have nothing
nothing i'm just gonna bet
a folds

[16:01]
if it's a very small checklist going to
come

[16:17]
face the ten percent in the turn
we're going to come

[16:40]
about the river get a snap call it's
good
shall we call this it's very small and

[16:46]
shall we call this it's very small and
the guy is pretty crazy if we flop
something
oh yes i have a
and we've we've flopped so many flashes
or we made so much flashes it's insane

[17:02]
or we made so much flashes it's insane
at least eliza king paris
i'll just let him do his finger
