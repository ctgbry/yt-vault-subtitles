podcast in this podcast we deconstruct
high stakes poker players figuring out

[00:16]
high stakes poker players figuring out
what it is about them how they think
what they do that makes them so
successful with an extra focus on the
obstacles they faced and the skills they
had to develop to surpass them over the
years me and Adam have gained a lot of

[00:30]
years me and Adam have gained a lot of
experience in both reaching high stakes
poker ourselves and teaching other

but without further Ado let's learn from
another high stakes player's journey in
today's episode welcome back to another
episode of the mechanics of Poker
podcast today in our pots we have
another very fast riser to my knowledge
the fastest Riser we've had on so far he

[01:17]
the fastest Riser we've had on so far he
plays in the high six scene cash games
very impressive it took 24 year old Owen
Messer only two years to establish
himself at 25.50 while playing both
heads up and six Max cash games that's

[01:30]
heads up and six Max cash games that's
very impressive you might have recently
heard of him as he took on the 100K
heads-up challenge against doc Paul
query ended up a slight winner over the
course of two matches
Adam balancing two game types one is

[01:45]
Adam balancing two game types one is
already hard enough let alone two
yeah it's impressive at his young age to
have success in two formats and I always
think these young fast risers there's a
lot to learn from they have a lot of
confidence they approach poker in a
different way they fast tracked their

[02:00]
different way they fast tracked their
learner curve to be able to learn the
game at impressive speed so yeah really
excited to see what we can learn from
Owen on his rise to the top
yeah me too I'm sure there will be a lot
of knowledge again in this podcast but

into today's episode
there he is Owen thank you for coming on
the podcast today
thanks for having me
oh and I've seen you on the high sex
cash game streets and more recently I

[03:16]
cash game streets and more recently I
saw you on YouTube taking on Doc Polk in
his 100K heads up challenge two obvious
questions kind of follow how did it go
let's see what everyone wants to know
who didn't follow it and what led you to
take on the challenge

[03:32]
um so in terms of how it went uh
well I mean obviously in the immediate
optimal if it kind of felt
pretty [ __ ] like the day after because I
was up so much and then finished
sort of close to break even like up like

[03:46]
sort of close to break even like up like
half a buying or something in the end
um but then also like you know I ran
insanely well the first day I was kind
of into some rum bad in the second day
um so I thought that was like kind of
fair and once uh

[04:00]
fair and once uh
was I had a bit of distance from it I
was just like really happy with the
whole experience I had a great time like
um yeah Doug Doug's like uh great fun
like it's not just an on-camera thing I
mean like we were playing some like PLO
and so I'm like I think it was like a

[04:15]
and so I'm like I think it was like a
one free game afterwards uh it was uh
yeah funny going over to that from 200
400 and uh yeah like meeting some of the
guys down there like it was uh it was
all a great time
uh like bit disappointed with how I
played on the second day

[04:30]
played on the second day
uh like during the first day I was I was
really happy with the whole thing
um
like I was talking to Doug afterwards
uh and um I was talking about how it's
often kind of a shame that like you know

[04:46]
often kind of a shame that like you know
all of the like all of the top players
sort of battle behind closed doors I
mean especially now that it's all on ACR
it's harder to rail than it was when it
used to be on stars back in the day
um and so he was saying that he kind of
thought of this as like that sort of

[05:01]
thought of this as like that sort of
like highlight of uh
you know of like premium like top tier
poker content like whole car like whole
cards up and and yeah I was thinking I
was thinking in the aftermath this was
like like this was the exact kind of
stream which if I wasn't being a part of

[05:15]
stream which if I wasn't being a part of
it I would have absolutely loved to
watch it like it was like we were really
going for it I thought like the
aggression from both of us was really
high like we weren't handing any pots to
each other
um we were slipping in bits of sharp
talk just because you know you get into
that uh
you get into that Rhythm

[05:32]
you get into that Rhythm
um and so yeah I I thought it was uh
yeah I was really happy with everything
to be honest did you have any prior
experience to playing life obviously
this was a live challenge He also

[05:45]
this was a live challenge He also
mentioned yeah obviously Varian is going
to be play a big part I don't know how
many hands you ended up playing but it's
probably not gonna be a lot so did you
feel comfortable in the live setting and
also in terms of the setting of the fact
that people can see your whole cards you
get a lot of exposure
yeah I think um

[06:01]
yeah I think um
honestly the worst thing about live is
having to keep mentally calculating the
part
um like that that was the thing which
that was driving me nuts I think it was
kind of relaxing especially playing doug
because I just know that unless he's

[06:15]
because I just know that unless he's
unless he's been living a lie for so
long at this point that it would almost
be impressive like he's not the guy
who's using live towels or like timing
towels or stuff like that so it was
kinda it was like nice that I wasn't
paranoid about that sort of stuff

[06:30]
paranoid about that sort of stuff
obviously I was trying to be you know
consistent with the stuff and not just
give stuff away just for the sake of it
but it was uh it was nice not to have
like that in the back of my head
um driving me insane and that I could
just focus on uh focus on the poker
because I I have very little experience

[06:45]
because I I have very little experience
live like I've played some live
tournaments and like done terribly and
done terribly in them for the most part
um like some live cash but like very
little very little experience so this
was yeah this was one of the one of the
first times really playing properly live
it's always quite interesting when

[07:00]
it's always quite interesting when
you're the one handing out these
challenges because
I don't know how if and if so how you
prepared for a match but I can imagine
that you've probably watched the
previous matches we that he played so I
think if you're in dog shoes or in
general the Challenger then usually

[07:16]
general the Challenger then usually
before or same with for example with gal
fund right he also does like these heads
up challenges I assume that players
going into a challenge they must have
analyzed the previous challenges to get
kind of an idea of they can pick up on
something like I I have a spreadsheet on

[07:31]
something like I I have a spreadsheet on
my laptop of like
like every single mistake I I expected
him to make and it's like very extensive
um so obviously I come in with an
advantage in that sense but also the
thing is about playing

[07:45]
thing is about playing
uh like him specifically he's a very
Theory oriented player
um so like whilst he has consistent
mistakes in his game
uh he's also like
like he's not getting super wildly out
of line so like the maximum sort of the

[08:01]
of line so like the maximum sort of the
maximum amount that you can own him for
by having a good read in a spot is quite
small compared to some other players so
I think like he's sort of well suited to
um to being able to do that like there
are other players who who I think would

[08:16]
are other players who who I think would
have a harder time like continuing to
face opposition
the bigger deviations you make the
bigger holes you think you have in your
game or the further do you play from
Theory the more you become exploitable I
guess that's kind of what you're saying

[08:30]
guess that's kind of what you're saying
yeah yeah and like he
he's like incredibly open about like
things he's not doing
um
like like he
you know he just says stuff like oh like
I think people who try to play razors

[08:46]
I think people who try to play razors
here uh like you know it's just
unnecessary it's just not a part of my
game and like he just like freely admits
that and he's like comfortable knowing
that you have that information and he
just he just has like the confidence in
his strategy that it's gonna

[09:01]
his strategy that it's gonna
play well enough anyway
and with anything ever with everything
he says you might automatically goes
into the solver note lock like okay wait
you don't have reasons this will be the
consequence of my strategy
yeah yeah I mean it's also like

[09:16]
yeah yeah I mean it's also like
it was weird because especially as we
got deeper into the match I was like I
was waiting for the adjustment in some
spots because I was just like okay I I
you know I was aware of when I'd had
illegal showdowns or perhaps spots where

[09:32]
illegal showdowns or perhaps spots where
like
you know like I tanked for ages with a
hand which should just be like should
just be folding and like even if I did
eventually fold like I was like okay
maybe this gives away that I was
thinking about something maybe he's

[09:45]
thinking about something maybe he's
gonna change it up but he didn't really
seem to adjust that much which sounds
like weird considering he smashed me on
the second day and like you know I did
really well in the first but it was like
I think he was like mostly playing in
yeah he he wasn't he wasn't really like

[10:00]
yeah he he wasn't he wasn't really like
getting into that leveling game at all
and I think I was just like wasting
energy on it
um to be honest
like trying to try and anticipate that
stuff I'm curious maybe in the future we
will try to get doggone and ask uh what
what how he sees it like from the
opposite point of view like I said

[10:16]
opposite point of view like I said
they're basically putting yourself out
there making yourself available to play
against and the likely preparation
people will do before getting into a
match like that I don't know maybe he
also said well Owen let's talk about
Owen I've seen all his online hands you

[10:30]
Owen I've seen all his online hands you
never know you never know
I streamed a bit the day before me
playing Daryl
he he
'll stream where he's like I have like I
don't know 50 views or something and
then like he like he popped in one with
me she's just like oh Doug's watching
his team I was like oh [ __ ] don't give

[10:46]
his team I was like oh [ __ ] don't give
too much away like
um yeah I mean also just a friend
talking to him about it because because
I
um I sort of joked him afterwards
because okay like he was saying I'm
welcome to come back again at some point

[11:01]
welcome to come back again at some point
if I'm like an American I'll say oh yeah
sure that because yeah I had a great
time it'd be fun
um like I was joking that the um the
goal was to play well enough that he
wouldn't invite me back
um but he he was just saying like it is

[11:16]
um but he he was just saying like it is
not much of an open challenge
if you're if you're like excluding
anyone and he just he just enjoys the
competition yeah he doesn't care also
with the amount of hands that you play
how much how much an EV BB per 100 can

[11:30]
how much how much an EV BB per 100 can
you actually lose
yeah yeah yeah exactly like
um it probably makes up for the fact
that it's his own brand and uh yeah yeah
we also gets um he like gets a rebate
from its stirring up action you know
like for every time like fairy time

[11:47]
like for every time like fairy time
there's a match where
um
like you know I go play him or like you
know K rap goes and plays him uh like
having said that I think he played K rap
from what I watched that match but uh
but like you know some someone else like

[12:01]
but like you know some someone else like
Gets In the Mood like sees what's going
on goes ah yeah yeah I could I could
play if they're like he's like not a
heads-up specialist
um
this was a heads up you play both six
Max and heads up and I wanted to quote
something that you mentioned in in the

[12:16]
something that you mentioned in in the
in the questionnaire you said anytime
someone quits me heads up I almost feel
high about like specifically heads up
that gives you that type of thrill
yeah I think it's like
um

[12:30]
um
it's like the
because heads up it's so it's so clearly
just like you versus this other person
and like you're just like you're sat
there pitted against each other in a
fight like trying to trying to out think

[12:46]
fight like trying to trying to out think
each other and there's both there's both
this competition of like okay whose base
strategy is winning before the
adjustments and then like the race to
out adjust each other like how can I
pick up on what he's doing wrong
before he picks up on what I'm doing

[13:00]
before he picks up on what I'm doing
wrong and then there can be there's
often this feeling of like you know once
you get the hang of someone that you're
just running circles around them
and like they're constantly in spots
where they're experiencing pain like
they're always in the tank
um they they don't really know what's

[13:15]
um they they don't really know what's
going on where it's like to you you're
like in in it's like Flow State and like
playing really fast and I think you know
when that moment comes and they just
decide it's done
um and then like yeah the realization
that someone's uh like this person was
this person fought like

[13:31]
this person fought like
they thought there was Evian playing me
and now they've just decided uh now
they've just decided that this is like
too expensive to to keep trying to find
out
um yeah it just feels I don't know it's
like like a huge ego boost
um I think it's sort of like yeah one of

[13:46]
um I think it's sort of like yeah one of
the reasons that I got into poker was um
was because uh
like basically I I wasn't sure what I
wanted to do in my life and like but I
wanted to do something where I could
like really like push myself and see

[14:01]
like really like push myself and see
like you know I I was like I know I was
a smart guy but I was like you know I
want to like actually know how smart I
am do you know what I mean rather than
just sit there and go like you know and
I was just like well this is like a
fairly uh this is like a fairly like

[14:15]
fairly uh this is like a fairly like
objective measure of that
um
and and also like no one gets a head
start on you you know like I pissed
about when I was a teenager I didn't
work on exams and I was like you know
I'm in this I'm in this field where it's
just like oh I'm not up against I'm not
up against some uh some Prodigy since

[14:31]
up against some uh some Prodigy since
they were 10 years old you know I get to
Yeah so basically the win only counts if
you're up against Fair competition
basically and I feel like the
competition gets the more I would say
satisfying the so basically if you if

[14:45]
satisfying the so basically if you if
you if you feel a high if someone quits
how do you feel then if you quit or you
just I don't quit okay that's a way to
avoid the feeling if you just never quit
like there are
there are people who I go into it with
the attitude of like like there are

[15:01]
the attitude of like like there are
people who are playing who I know I'm
losing to
um
uh and it's just like I just I'm just
interested like like
um like yeah I like if Linus would play
5K I'd play them for a bit but like I'm

[15:15]
5K I'd play them for a bit but like I'm
not I'm not gonna play some huge match
but like one time
once I'm committed to playing somewhat I
mean I say this I haven't I haven't been
playing for that long but like there's
like I think there's like no one who I'm
turning down action from at the moment
like I just want to play I just want to
play everyone it helps us as well that

[15:31]
play everyone it helps us as well that
I'm like running like really well out
the gate so like that gives you the
confidence to to just go and uh to just
go and like
sit basically everyone I said uh yeah
yeah I say this wow yeah I I I mean I I

[15:45]
yeah I say this wow yeah I I I mean I I
basically yeah if anyone wants to play
5K I'm down to play like it's almost
some match at like 40K obviously it's a
different thing I have to I have to be
pretty confident that I'm winning that
but like just to you know play at the
stake return playing like day to day and
like you know like you were saying with
the Doug match if I'm playing for

[16:01]
the Doug match if I'm playing for
if we've not playing like a huge amount
of hands like how much EV am I really
losing by like competing against this
person but yeah like so far there's been
no one I quit like I temporarily quit
Daryl when I first played him because he
ran such circles around me that I was
completely lost

[16:16]
completely lost
um but now we're like now like
tentatively like okay yeah yeah let's
let's let's play Daryl some more like
I'm running well enough against everyone
else that if he smacks me for a bin or
two you know we can
we can get it back what do you mean with
uh run circles

[16:32]
uh run circles
I was like it was just
there were there were spots where I was
um so used to
like like I had I had sort of like this

[16:45]
like like I had I had sort of like this
assumptions about how people were going
to think about them
um like there were lines which I just
wasn't used to seeing
uh it was like you know you kind of know
this line exists but you sort of like
discount it in your thought process a
bit

[17:00]
bit
um
like I was getting like five bet on the
river
um by him and like actually not knowing
what to do you know it wasn't like it
wasn't some spot where it's just like oh
well
you know
obviously he [ __ ] has it at this
point no it was like like I I was

[17:16]
point no it was like like I I was
actually just sitting there like like he
you know he could have gloves here and
like yeah he was just playing at like a
very consistently High aggression level
and I wasn't that you know I wasn't that
comfortable dealing with it because I
hadn't played anyone

[17:30]
hadn't played anyone
um like I played some spewy people but
like he had like control to his
aggression and it was um
yeah and and I was just like I was just
like so aware of how out of my depth I
was uh like instantly so I was just like
so it was like unsatisfying it was

[17:46]
so it was like unsatisfying it was
unsatisfying to play you know someone's
beating me if someone's beating you by a
little bit
then to me that feels very motivating to
try and close that Gap you know like
like if I'm losing at 5pb to someone
then it's just like okay yeah but like I
I don't feel like I've peaked as a

[18:01]
I don't feel like I've peaked as a
player uh so so to me that's that's like
okay well we can get it to even and then
if I can get it to even I can get it to
beating them
um but like there I was just like I
didn't even know how much I was losing
but I I just felt I just felt completely
lost I was going to say it feels a bit

[18:16]
lost I was going to say it feels a bit
like the sense of where you that you
don't know kind of where you're at right
with okay there's a bunch of these
things going on I'm not really sure
where I'm at at least if you know that
you're minus five you know you know
where zero but if you're like I have no
clue if if a minus 10 minus five plus

[18:32]
clue if if a minus 10 minus five plus
five I have no clue well no when I first
played him like minus five was like the
upper bound of what I felt I was losing
at and it was funny as well because like
someone else who like uh had they

[18:45]
someone else who like uh had they
shocked me at every single time I'd
moved upstairs right so I'd like
uh I played this guy uh at like when I
first played 500 mL like because because
I would always battle like I'd sit on
the tables to heads up like I wouldn't
quit uh and like I'd lost so much for

[19:01]
quit uh and like I'd lost so much for
this guy too I think I'm down the most
in big lines to this guy but anyone else
but I'm up and then like he quits me
without barely like didn't even lose any
of it back he just goes ah nah nah like
he says something about like he's mixing
uh you know he doesn't want to mix his
up in six minutes like okay fair enough

[19:15]
up in six minutes like okay fair enough
but like he doesn't want to play
um
oh by the way like this this own guy uh
like he basically plays anyone by the
way I'll leave you two to it and I felt

[19:30]
way I'll leave you two to it and I felt
like
I was just like I was just aware of like
I was aware of what's going on but I was
just like I was too curious to see what
the Gap was I was like I need I need to
go you know I need to go then and now I
feel like now I feel like it's like okay

[19:45]
feel like now I feel like it's like okay
like you know there's there's a pretty
decent chance he's still like he's still
winning but it's also it's like
you know
um but but it feels like a fight now you
know so which is more satisfying to me
because then I can go away from it and
like I I can look and review things and

[20:01]
like I I can look and review things and
and see if I can come back the next
session better and feel feel confident
about it this is very much against I
would say over the years it's become way
more common for people to have very high
on the list that they have to look for
and only playing games where they have a

[20:15]
and only playing games where they have a
match you clearly have a different
attitude knowing that you have -5 BB win
rate you're still willing to go in so
what is it about what is what is the
what is in it for you is it purely the
challenge
um you know you know like that story
that everyone tells about Linus where

[20:31]
that everyone tells about Linus where
he'd quit
[Music]
um
like you mad bro told me that story
years ago when I was first playing 500

[20:45]
years ago when I was first playing 500
now he was telling me I need to get
better game selection
and I was actually just inspired by I
was just like yeah that's the kind of
player I want to be
I was like
um but I I also think it's kind of just
in my nature like um
because back when I was

[21:01]
because back when I was
like the reason I learned heads up was
sort of by accident like it was back
November time
uh I was I've been on like a huge
downswing for like the past year
um I was sort of like starting to come
out of it

[21:15]
out of it
and I was thinking about what is it that
gets me playing my best possible poker
because
um I think like Yuri talked about this
when he was on the podcast and he feels
like he has like a plus 15 BB winner and
like a minus 10 BB loser within him and

[21:32]
like a minus 10 BB loser within him and
I feel like that's kind of how I play as
well and I was thinking well
what gets me to playing into playing
that State of Mind where like I feel
invincible and it's just
and it's like not thinking about all

[21:45]
and it's like not thinking about all
that background stuff it's just like I'm
just here to like play and like beat who
you put in front of me so I just had
this sort of I just had this mentality
of like I was just gonna I was just
gonna play anyone that came and like not
worry about fish games I was just like
red battling all night

[22:00]
red battling all night
um and it'll be like 300 and then
sometimes would go to heads up and I was
just like okay well I'm not gonna quit
just because it's heads up and I started
playing it and I was just like really
really enjoying it um
I was just playing like kind of for fun
at first just for battling and it's like
you know you get into enough spots that
you're curious about Ransom Sims and

[22:16]
you're curious about Ransom Sims and
then like sort of backs and it's like oh
I'm kind of studying this format now uh
and then like it was interesting enough
that I was just um
yeah I mean I'm still like I'm still
like playing More in terms of six Max
because obviously like heads up is like

[22:30]
because obviously like heads up is like
it's a bit inconsistent whereas six
months you can get action all the time
but it's like in terms of what is most
fun uh most fun to me like I was
immediately just like oh yeah this
really this really gets me feeling like
passionate about the game to to go out
and battle with people

[22:45]
and battle with people
I wanted to touch on another thing that
you mentioned you mentioned that that
you think that's the sport aspect of
Poker is often overshadowed by the
gambling side of it
which may be a leveler so that's kind of
like an indirect shot at Hustler Casino

[23:00]
like an indirect shot at Hustler Casino
but like I I don't like it's not like I
have a problem with that stuff existing
but it's like
um
was it you you compare it to chess right
you know
for like if if you look at chess

[23:16]
for like if if you look at chess
coverage you don't have coverage of like
oh two billionaires playing two
billionaires are playing like the winner
gets 100K every every match uh like
every game and like they play like a 10
game match whatever like that doesn't
you know you don't see that in chess you

[23:32]
you know you don't see that in chess you
you see
is like the top guys versus you know
versus the other top guys and it's
appreciation of you know it's
appreciation of how beautiful the game
can be when played at such a high level

[23:45]
can be when played at such a high level
um
and I mean obviously it's the nature of
Poker because like the money has to has
to come from somewhere and also like top
players uh like of course like kind of
secretive about their strategy so it's
like no one wants to be the guy who's
volunteering

[24:00]
volunteering
you know all this stuff like like I was
kind of tempted to do some streaming
because you know I I feel like I would
enjoy that aspect of it but it's also
like if I just play with my whole cards
revealed all the time in like a small
pool of like high sex beds even if it's

[24:15]
pool of like high sex beds even if it's
not like heads up if I'm just playing
six Max with every single like whole
cars revealed it's like like people
these These are really smart guys who
are going to use that information and
um
and so yeah yeah so so like I understand
why it is that way but I I think I think

[24:31]
why it is that way but I I think I think
it's a real shame because I think
there's there's like so many interesting
things happening in poker and I think
like
I think I think like people well I know
that people would find it so interesting
but it's kind of a shame that that's

[24:45]
but it's kind of a shame that that's
that sort of side of it is is hidden and
it's like you know the only thing we can
celebrate is sort of like the big parts
and like the emotions of people going on
these massive swings yeah I think it's
also I mean the content that's being put
out there is mainly constructed in a way

[25:00]
out there is mainly constructed in a way
that the mass audience consumes it right
what the math audience likes is what we
start to produce like Jose Casino
apparently produces a format that the
mass audience like I think for example
the format that you did with dog is way
closer to a chess format where it's

[25:15]
closer to a chess format where it's
basically you're watching and you're
interested in high level strategy and a
certain amount of intelligence but I
would I haven't checked the numbers but
I would imagine that I don't know Max
Payne One Million buying Hustler event
probably the address way a way bigger

[25:32]
probably the address way a way bigger
audience right yeah yeah I mean oh yeah
obviously it's like
yeah it's like you can't force people to
like something but I just think it's a
shame that like they're clearly you know
there there are YouTube channels out

[25:45]
there there are YouTube channels out
there which are like trying to cover
strategy content but it's like often the
guys who are doing it are not
super high level guys you know like
where whereas
it's like well it's just like I mean who
like who's giving away their strap for

[26:00]
like who's giving away their strap for
free who plays like high stakes online I
I I I mean like well I mean like Doug
has like you know Duncan like had like
the upswing stuff even when he was still
like playing regularly but I think like
that was kind of the exception

[26:15]
that was kind of the exception
um like there are some like
I don't know there's like 1K now guys
and stuff but like you don't you don't
have in the same way where like you know
chess on someday like even if Magnus
isn't streaming there's like multiple
GMS like streaming like talking like
being instructive uh and it's really

[26:30]
being instructive uh and it's really
cool to see how they think whereas like
you don't you don't have a you don't get
to go onto twitch and then see like
Stefan talking about how he's pissing
everyone up and like you know these
insane lines he's running you sort of
just get to see the line and then it's
just like you know was this good and

[26:45]
just like you know was this good and
it's like oh I guess it was because it
was Stefan but I you know like like I
feel like
like I mean for someone who's like
looked at so many of his hands they
definitely like even if you're really
good at poker they're like
kind of inaccessible like you have to
spend time on them whereas and it would

[27:00]
spend time on them whereas and it would
be really cool to hear people talk about
that but obviously you know I see where
they can't it's just a shame that that's
like that's the way the game works
yeah if I talk from experience let's say
for example you stream or you make a
video let's say you can play a hand and
I feel like it's mainly in the way you

[27:15]
I feel like it's mainly in the way you
explain it that could get kind of the
AHA across to the other person so let's
say I make I make a video for YouTube I
might explain it I might play the hand
exactly the same I'll show how I play
the hand but how I would explain the
hand I might keep some information aside

[27:31]
hand I might keep some information aside
or I will use a different argument
that's less valuable than if I would be
doing it in a in a coaching session for
example or when I talk with other guys
who I do strategy with I will explain it
in a way different way that's like oh
actually this makes a lot of sense
yeah yeah I know of course it's just

[27:45]
yeah yeah I know of course it's just
like you kind of like this this
information has has like so much EV and
it's like not even just Within
the one person adjusting right like
there's like this whole audience like
there are some streamers who

[28:01]
there are some streamers who
I watched back when I was playing like
uh you know like background playing like
500 mL or whatever uh
and it was like it was also telling what
they wouldn't notice
you know like sometimes you could you

[28:15]
you know like sometimes you could you
could get like a really detailed picture
of someone's leaks
just by the things the things that they
missed uh and so then it's kind of like
well yeah like most of the people who
stream uh um have something to to
promote or like

[28:30]
promote or like
they're playing Midstates and it doesn't
mean like they're terrible players but
it um you know like especially if you're
if you're like playing 25 an hour and
like there's a 500 Zoom streamer like
there's clearly some uh there's clearly
like some usefulness in that but it's
just like seeing the guys like at the

[28:45]
just like seeing the guys like at the
absolute top where like they're playing
like you know what the [ __ ] hands like
multiple times a session uh and it'd be
it would be amazing to hear about the
Dynamics which went into all these like
adjustments and counter adjustments but
you kind of just have to like guess at
it if you're um if you're a viewer

[29:02]
it if you're um if you're a viewer
yeah when you're I think also when
you're playing and putting your content
out there are the streaming or recording
I mean when you make an adjustment or
counter adjustment you can always just
say that the dice told you to do it so
if you yeah yeah you stream I can tell

[29:17]
if you yeah yeah you stream I can tell
you from experience if you want to do
something always or never you just say
ah the dice the dice dice roll this way
or the dice roll that way or you you can
make a lot of you can make up a lot of
excuses you mentioned chess briefly as

[29:30]
excuses you mentioned chess briefly as
well I believe you have a history in
chess as well pre-poker yeah yeah I mean
when I was when I was younger I played
for the uh England junior team
um which is kind of fun I mean like yeah
we've got a trip to Disneyland out of it

[29:46]
we've got a trip to Disneyland out of it
um highlight highlight of the chess
career trip to Disneyland yeah yeah yeah
no yeah
um I mean there was a there were
probably some good wins in there but
that's a bit which sticks out in my mind
um but yeah that was when I was like
uh like as

[30:01]
uh like as
I was playing like International
tournaments from like 11 to 14 years old
and then I Then I then I retired uh I
decided I was uh I was kind of sick of
it I think I was just like

[30:15]
it I think I was just like
um
because like like the word always land
that I I like learned by playing
um I just played like I played tons and
uh didn't really do much Theory work
um and then but like that only takes you

[30:30]
um and then but like that only takes you
so far right
um there is a point where you need to
sit there with the engine and and work
out exactly what's going wrong with your
games
um but yeah I was I wasn't very really
interested in that and then it's like
okay well people are starting to leave

[30:45]
okay well people are starting to leave
me behind
and like if I couldn't like if I could
if I couldn't compete it wasn't like it
wasn't like I needed to
you know it wasn't like I needed to be
like being everyone all the time like I
wasn't like I definitely wasn't like the
top guy in England or anything uh but it

[31:01]
top guy in England or anything uh but it
was like you know if you can't like
these people who used to be able to like
give a good game and like take a game
off them occasionally and it's just like
oh they're just like completely
outplaying me and I don't want to put in
the work to stay in touch with them
um
so yeah but like that that was one of

[31:16]
so yeah but like that that was one of
the things which got me like motivated
later on to to pursue
uh to pursue poker was because
I didn't want to like look back on that
and go
ah like I could have been a grand master
if I put in the effort you know like

[31:31]
if I put in the effort you know like
like it's like like the the classic like
talking about potential as if it uh as
if it's achievement
um and so that was something which I
really wanted to
um but they're like I yeah I really
didn't want to have like hanging over me

[31:45]
didn't want to have like hanging over me
because it wasn't like I regreted like
giving up on chess specifically
but I didn't want I didn't want to just
end up doing something that wasn't
entirely satisfying and just like have a
bunch of excuses to anyone that would
listen I'd rather just go out there and
like do something and

[32:01]
like do something and
um you know and like like just prove it
uh prove it to myself like that he
actually mentioned also like if you want
to get better in in chess you know you
have to sit down with the engine I don't
know much about Chess but I was looking
at some matches and I already heard some
commentators and they were indeed also

[32:15]
commentators and they were indeed also
consoling the solver see what the solver
is doing actually also maybe that's
something also for uh that they can add
in like live streams that we can put up
the solver and say actually the solver
doesn't really agree with this just like
they may be doing chess maybe we can
make it yeah yeah a bit more

[32:31]
make it yeah yeah a bit more
intellectually stimulating I guess what
similarities do you see in chess
that come back in poker that maybe gave
you a little bit of a head start when
you got into book
um so I would say like

[32:47]
um so I would say like
like what like the main similarity is um
you
uh you have to take
sort of um you you have to take
something which is like very specific

[33:00]
something which is like very specific
when you look at the chess engine where
it will tell you just the right move and
like poker will tell you the right
frequency and then you have to turn that
into something abstract which you can
apply to like not just this position or
this hand but something which you could
actually like add to your game as a

[33:16]
actually like add to your game as a
whole
um and so like you know adding yeah like
like the development of your heuristics
um
say like the the main the main
difference though is that like chess has
this uh this continuity that poker

[33:30]
this uh this continuity that poker
doesn't like like chess is like building
to a crescendo in a sense of like it's
like you're applying pressure
um you know you're applying pressure
over 30 moves or something to try and
make someone crack whereas like poker is
like uh poker's like death by a thousand
cups
um which is yeah I think that's how they

[33:46]
um which is yeah I think that's how they
end up different
NMU into chess or ever been into chess
I was when I was younger because I've
got an older brother and my dad was
quite competitive with chess but
definitely wasn't representing my
country at chess if I did find the

[34:01]
country at chess if I did find the
Strategic kind of heads up Dynamic like
Owen's been describing there's something
Primal about playing another person
whether it's chess or heads of Poker
one-on-one but it's like your strategy
against their strategy either I win you
lose or vice versa and there's something
very rewarding about out maneuvering

[34:16]
very rewarding about out maneuvering
someone well it's on the chess boards or
in a heads of dynamic which is quite
intense but also very rewarding and
especially from the ego point of view to
uh outing somebody out smaller someone
and create a winning strategy against
them greatest Good Feeling something
definitely relate to uh one's high that

[34:31]
definitely relate to uh one's high that
it gets from getting the points to quit
that was definitely so my high moments
were when someone quit after a long
battle I was like yes that's a that's a
great day do you think it's also like a
certain necessity increase when you play
heads up so let's say for example you
play a ring game

[34:45]
play a ring game
usually what can happen is you might
play against there's a guy at the table
or two guys that you think are better
than you there's two other guys who you
think you're better at and there's the
recreational you can get the money from
so you could be like okay well I'm
mainly going to focus on the
recreational that's where the main money
comes from but if you play heads up

[35:00]
comes from but if you play heads up
let's say it's just me versus Owen I
mean if I want to make this a win
there's only one one opponent where I
can take the money from so I think it's
maybe also raises a certain amount of
necessity that you actually have to
think that okay well if I have to get
the money from oh and I have to now

[35:16]
the money from oh and I have to now
really sit down and see how I'm gonna go
to figure this out so I think maybe the
nature of heads up also stares your
brain in a certain direction it's like
listen this is the way you have to get
through this so you get stimulating
whereas maybe in the six Max you're like
oh well you know I'll take the money

[35:30]
oh well you know I'll take the money
from recreational or oh actually oh wait
there's a better game there so I'll just
quit this table and add and add this
table because the money is easier does
that make sense can can any any of you
two relate yeah I know 100 like like
six Max I mean

[35:46]
six Max I mean
I can't tell you the amount of times
um
people who tried to talk me into like
playing tighter when like Stefan free
Batman or something and I was just like
you're like like if we were like looking
over hands and they're just like I know
you're not going to take this advice but
like this hand is like a zero EV mix you

[36:01]
like this hand is like a zero EV mix you
don't have to play it like you can just
stay out this way like is it this is Max
mentality right there like listen uh you
know you have the table there's money
there money there and you kind of you
kind of to maneuver through the table to
get the highest GV spots it's really a

[36:15]
get the highest GV spots it's really a
six Max mentality not a heads up
mentality yeah but um but like yeah
those those this amazing thing clicker
said to me when I was talking to him
afterwards about the Doug map
um
there's like hovels it was uh says

[36:30]
there's like hovels it was uh says
something like uh heads up there's
nowhere to hide
um you can
you can lock lock your doors lock your
windows oh come on I'll come in for your
floorboards
[Laughter]

[36:46]
like image of like uh I don't know if
you've seen like like there's like an
article of like clicker when he went to
the WSOP and he's wearing like a cowboy
hat or something and I just have an
image of like that guy like you know
like like as like a horror movie as a

[37:00]
like like as like a horror movie as a
horror movie character like climbing up
through the floorboards to take your
bankroll and uh yeah that's that's the
idea like you're you know you're gonna
get in somehow like they they have to
like they have to leave an opening
somewhere somewhere if they wanna if
they want to close one somewhere else
yeah I think it's also like a more

[37:16]
yeah I think it's also like a more
direct conflict you're almost bought
going in there with an assumption that
I've got a better strategy than you in
that they claiming a thing and then
you're gonna test it against each other
and there's no Hiding Place either it's
a stalemate or someone's got an edge
under the player and there's lots
invested in that the longer you play the

[37:30]
invested in that the longer you play the
more invested you are in your assumption
being correct and unless you're going in
there for a learn experience like you
playing lioness or somebody where you're
maybe taking it for granted that they
have an edge most the time you're going
in there to beat that other person so
yeah it's a direct conflict in some some

[37:45]
yeah it's a direct conflict in some some
Avenues which can definitely create a
intense emotional reaction both women
and losing I can actually strongly
relate as well like if I would be
playing three-handed you'll be very very
focused and let's say a recreational
joins the table
it's somehow you you take a step back

[38:00]
it's somehow you you take a step back
somehow it's like oh and then right now
okay let's focused you have to start to
make more mistakes and then you actually
are less of a winner than when you were
playing very tough line apprehended for
example
yeah yeah I I like yeah that was that

[38:16]
yeah yeah I I like yeah that was that
was exactly what I just noticed about
myself but I was just like I I I'd have
all of these like
you know allegedly very good tables and
I would just be like
blundering or like missing like missing

[38:31]
blundering or like missing like missing
things which I'd usually catch and I
think it was just because I I felt like
I just was making money just for showing
up
um because you know because there was a
spot at the table
um
so so yeah and that was why I kind of

[38:45]
so so yeah and that was why I kind of
decided that I was just gonna
like why I was gonna just play just play
everyone uh and and it kind of means
that now like if a recreational comes
along I'm still still trying to like
maintain that sort of like you know
Predator mentality right where it's just
like

[39:00]
like
yeah it's like it's like I've like I've
earned this table by getting people to
not play me you know like I've only
opens it and like now they have to come
because there's a recreational okay like
now that they have to pay me like now
I'm gonna crush them yeah exactly that
was I remember also that was at some

[39:15]
was I remember also that was at some
point I started to notice this and every
time when the table would fill out
because you kind of think like oh yeah
now it's easy quote quote that's kind of
I think what what happens in your brain
uh but then I said no no okay so another
goals now not to win at this table the

[39:30]
goals now not to win at this table the
goal is how can I punish the guys who
now sit sit at my table how can I make
them they they hunted in my game how can
I make them now no longer a winner that
then became my sort of my goal so that
race is kind of the challenge yeah I

[39:46]
race is kind of the challenge yeah I
sort of like catch myself thinking like
ah like you know these like the bum
Hunters don't deserve an easy ride you
know yeah I know I can I can very much
relate to this experience like like they
they don't get to play me on my b game

[40:00]
they don't get to play me on my b game
just because they've waited for a wreck
to come and they've dodged the wreck
battling uh the red battling like they
they still like you know I still want to
make I still want to make life as tough
as possible for these guys I want to be
like a problem at the table for them

[40:15]
like a problem at the table for them
I think what we're describing here Adam
is clear
a clear example of Flow State
yes and also uh of almost like initially
like a challenge response you're someone
who thrives on challenge you want to be
confronted you want to be the alpha if

[40:31]
confronted you want to be the alpha if
the kind of Dynamics and you're willing
to battle to prove it so you're almost
like once like uh once said he really
resonated with Linus quit in the table
when a fish comes most players don't
resonate with that most players are like
what like is this guy just bearing the
money so it takes a certain personality

[40:45]
money so it takes a certain personality
to really step into competition that
battle to wanting to prove yourself also
requires a lot of confidence because I
can relate this conversation as well too
sunny one of our other previous guests
it was also a fast Riser he has a
similar mindset of just sitting in
really tough games and not being scared
of what comes from that just willing to
put it on the line so there comes an

[41:00]
put it on the line so there comes an
element of trusting yourself to play a
tough opponents because when you're
doing what owners and stepping into the
kind of lions then so to speak there's
other lines there who want to rip you
apart so you've got to be able to uh
hold your own to stand up to them so
yeah I'm curious to know actually for
yourself oh and what have been some of

[41:15]
yourself oh and what have been some of
the ways this is backfired I can
definitely tell how it's got a lot of
benefits to uh putting you in tough
scenarios and learn to grow in has there
been any sort of tying challenges where
you'd be like I wish I wasn't so
competitive I wish I was more of a
bumper
um

[41:32]
I don't know I don't know really I I
don't feel like because like obviously
you know I probably could have made more
money in a different way
uh if I was game selecting a bit more
um
or like you know devoting more time to

[41:45]
or like you know devoting more time to
trying to get into some good games
but I'd also like I think I'm a much
better player because of this attitude
and then like the long-term EV of being
a better player is just worth more to me
than the money like if someone said to

[42:01]
than the money like if someone said to
me okay well you could have like bum
hunted this year and you could be like
100k richer but you wouldn't have
you know you wouldn't have done like all
that battling and like learned like with
that intensity
then yeah I'd much rather I'd much

[42:16]
then yeah I'd much rather I'd much
rather be this way I don't know what I
don't know what the dollar amount is
where I've become a bun Hunter I mean
surely there is one somewhere but yeah I
just feel like it's uh
it's like like you know like there's
there are these 20K red battles going on

[42:30]
there are these 20K red battles going on
on ACR right and like
okay like it's hard to say who exactly
is winning and who's losing but like
let's say Linus is still crushing them
you know like he doesn't have to go hunt
for a fish to to have like this this
crashing win rate and like the way you

[42:45]
crashing win rate and like the way you
get to there is by having that like you
know that fighting spirit and also by
by learning as much as you can so it's
like I've always thought of
so the money will follow the value if
you create that value within yourself
then
um then the money will take care of

[43:00]
um then the money will take care of
itself later
um
so yeah I don't know I wouldn't really
say I've regretted this at all uh it's
probably like exacerbated some
some downswings but I also feel like I'm
pretty I'm like
I'm like pretty okay with handling them

[43:16]
I'm like pretty okay with handling them
like I mean obviously they you know they
suck but I don't feel like they you know
I don't feel like as affected by other
people and especially if you're playing
in really tough games it's like I've
sort of gone into them with the
mentality like okay this could this can
go horribly like even if I'm winning
this can go horribly because these are

[43:31]
this can go horribly because these are
good players right like that and the
standard deviation is going to be huge
um so yeah
yeah I think for you it's clear that the
the long-term goal is to be as good as
possible be the best version yourself
I want to be number one like I don't

[43:45]
I want to be number one like I don't
know if I'll make it I hope I'll make it
but um
but I I want to be number one in fact
there was like a
the reason I chose my screen name
uh and call myself Prodigy which is
incredibly cocky I'm well aware

[44:00]
incredibly cocky I'm well aware
um was basically I was on like a huge
downswing at five I mean I say huge I
was on like a 20 buying down swing but
the smaller stake I was playing was 1K
right I wasn't playing anything in
between so I was on like 100k like I
think it's like 130k downswing of like

[44:15]
think it's like 130k downswing of like
of like I I like I mean it was more than
half my role basically
um and like what kept happening is you
know like I grind at 1K for eight years
finally get the roll back to a decent
point
uh go back to

[44:30]
uh go back to
go back to the 5K it gets smacked until
I was like getting tilted enough that I
didn't fancy going back down and I was
kind of like de-gening the role of it um
to keep playing in those games
and
you know like at a certain point like
that starts creepy and it's just like I
could just like smack about 1K yeah I

[44:47]
could just like smack about 1K yeah I
could just play in this game where like
there's a comfortable win rate these
people aren't testing me as much it's
not a stressful like even when it goes
wrong
uh like I'm you know there's no doubt
about uh like whether I'm winning in the
game long term

[45:01]
game long term
um and so but and then like I made an
account on ACR
um so I've only been playing on TG at
that point I mainly count on ACR and
like I was trying to think of the name
and I thought the name Prodigy and I was
like oh that's you know it's kind of
cocky as I said but then I was thinking

[45:15]
cocky as I said but then I was thinking
like
if I call myself prodigy
and then like I sit at 1K forever and I
don't make it happen and I don't crack
high stakes like that will tilt me so
hard like seeing like I've just called
myself Prodigy and then like never made
it happen like I've just like lied to

[45:30]
it happen like I've just like lied to
myself and so I kind of like you know
wrote it down and sort of like a promise
to myself that like this is gonna be you
know this is gonna be correct like like
this is you know I'm gonna put in the
effort and like this is I'm gonna make
this I'm gonna make this come true
um I love that it's almost like we uh we

[45:46]
um I love that it's almost like we uh we
have a real strong desire and urge to
stay consistent with our own Narrative
of ourselves and sometimes putting
ourselves on the line like that calling
yourself The Prodigy is like all right
well that's me deliver to that now I
can't sit and boom because I'm the I'm
The Prodigy now so yeah yeah and this
was one this was when I like decided I

[46:00]
was one this was when I like decided I
was just gonna play everyone right I was
like I was just like yeah there's no
you know if you're gonna be cocky do it
right like
no no half measures
all right so your journey that's that's
track backtrack a little bit and go
through your kind of fast ride so you

[46:15]
through your kind of fast ride so you
went from I don't know what Stacy
exactly started at but you got the one
cares within about a year because you
thought it was through that just kind of
fast rise through their Stakes early on
what are some of the things you were
learning how were you able to progress
to 1K so quickly
so I think

[46:31]
so I think
um
like I think
well when I like first played like my
first ever tournament I went to my
university poker sock and I won the
tournament I mean it was only for 200 at

[46:45]
tournament I mean it was only for 200 at
200 quid but like I won that and then
like I went online
like a few weeks later I played like a
15 tourney it was like a huge field and
I won that for 5K and so I was like I
was like sun running right out the gate
uh now I lost a bunch of it back so I
thought it was better than it was but

[47:00]
thought it was better than it was but
then that like really like you know the
realization that I wasn't as good
um it like actually like really really
motivated me
um to get better I mean I was also I was
also like already in love with the game
like you know it doesn't hurt when you
like run run like a god right at the

[47:15]
like run run like a god right at the
start
um
yeah um
yeah I just remember I think
yeah honestly I think I was just like I
was just a bit like Untamed I guess is
Jose and it like really really worked

[47:30]
Jose and it like really really worked
for those Stakes
um
like I just wanted like I just wanted to
Bluff people and like not in like any
like I just felt like I just felt good
if I got like you know if I got a
bluffer against these people so and it's

[47:45]
bluffer against these people so and it's
like when you're playing against a
population who is like overwhelmingly
Too Thai
um you don't really need any subtlety
like that can come later
um especially because I was playing on
party poker which is like we've had like
I don't know if any of the playback is
like it you use like leaderboard grind

[48:02]
like it you use like leaderboard grind
there's like all these people playing
like insane hours
um and like you know they're just like
folding all these close spots and I
think I was like like I didn't really
have much technical knowledge but I was
just Fearless like uh instantly

[48:15]
just Fearless like uh instantly
um
so yeah I got to yeah I got to 1K like
fairly fast
um yeah I can't I think it was like 1K
was when I first started like actually
working on the technical side of my game
I think before before then like I was

[48:30]
I think before before then like I was
just like you know just trying to just
trying to scare people and like it works
because if people aren't too Technical
and like they have like very simple
heuristics where it's like oh if someone
puts a stack in they have it and it's
like well you know
that's kind of that's kind of an easy
one to explain right like like you know
it's no limit holding it's not exactly

[48:46]
it's no limit holding it's not exactly
work to get to get the stacking if you
know that that's like good in most
situations
um so yeah I was pretty uh like pretty
wild and no subtlety but yeah I think I
think you can you can kind of make that
approach work for for at least until
like well I don't know if I I don't know

[49:00]
like well I don't know if I I don't know
I haven't played those stakes in a while
but I would say like at least until 200
mL these days I would guess you can just
be you can just be a bit insane and they
don't fight back
it sounds like your natural fearlessness
and aggression set you up well to begin
with some run Goods as well which like
Fast tracked your your eyes at this

[49:17]
Fast tracked your your eyes at this
stage were you all in a poker or were
you doing any studies or did you have
anything else going in your life I was
all in like instantly like yeah yeah it
was like complete like like I was
technically still studying
but like I was just like I wasn't going

[49:31]
but like I was just like I wasn't going
to class like I wasn't handing in my
essays
um remember I got back uh like for
Christmas
and I'd made like I've made like 4K or
something in a month which was like huge
money to me at the time on a student

[49:47]
money to me at the time on a student
loan uh and I just showed it to my
parents I was like okay
like around world this month but I've
also like you know look like I can do
this and sort of proof and then they
were you know they were like very
supportive they were just like okay if
you're really short you can drop out of

[50:01]
you're really short you can drop out of
uni I was like I am really sure and I
also kind of like slipped them at that
point I was like yeah I've done no work
this year like at minimum I'll be
retaking second year
um so so then they were just like okay
well you could like and like the Union

[50:15]
well you could like and like the Union
as well were like uh were just like well
you can drop out like if you want to
restart again next year and so I sort of
had this like I sort of had this time to
just like go for it with no
repercussions
um so yeah I just like
yeah I just like fully threw myself into

[50:30]
yeah I just like fully threw myself into
it there was someone I knew from uni who
was a pro like I was like instantly
getting coaching from him
um
like straight out the gate and uh
I like I like bought upswing immediately
like consumed all the content in the lab
um
and uh

[50:46]
and uh
yeah I was just like I was just like
instantly obsessed it was like
effortless it didn't feel like work you
know like I wasn't
um
I didn't feel pressure to work hard to
make up for quitting my degree I was
just like I was just like playing and
studying an insane amount because of

[51:01]
studying an insane amount because of

further Ado let's get back into more

[53:00]
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode
so you're all in a poker you're Rising
quickly things are going well you're
running good on top of that and then as
you mentioned when you started playing
5K is reality kicked in and you had a
six month patch of losing half your roll
up to 100K what was about that time that

[53:15]
up to 100K what was about that time that
was challenging and how did you get
through that time I'm sure people who
are listening to this may go wow that's
a super challenging period and I'm not
sure if I could go six months with
losing half my role what were some
things that were going on because at
that time and how did you uh push past
that yeah I think

[53:30]
that yeah I think
like I I was down lifetime in cash games
at one point by like quite a bit as well
because I kept uh I kept keeping the 5K
shots going by like blinking tourneys
which led to a really weird imposter
syndrome where I was like a like down
lifetime in cash just like it's like

[53:47]
lifetime in cash just like it's like
still playing high stakes just like wait
am I a fish
I might have been I might
remember

[54:00]
I think like part of
um yeah like part of the problem was
like the the uncertainty of like knowing
what the gap
was
um like I knew these guys were better

[54:15]
um like I knew these guys were better
than me but it's like
um
like you know when you play like other
Stakes right there's like you know
there's the hunger than our wrecks
there's a 200 nrx whatever but when you
get to 5K it's like basically everyone

[54:31]
get to 5K it's like basically everyone
plays 5K that's like maybe I don't know
it's like five ten guys who can't be
bothered of like the online players
um
and so so it was like it was like really
stressful being like okay

[54:46]
stressful being like okay
I know I was like I know I was like one
of the top guys at 1K and I was like
usually that just transitions into the
next stake but then I could just feel
like I like yeah I wasn't really sure
how much more work I had to do and like
I you know it's like it's like this sort

[55:00]
I you know it's like it's like this sort
of um
it's almost like cognitive dissonance of
like having like this you know this
faith in your own abilities and just
being like okay I do all these things
well and then but also just being
confronted by the evidence you know it's
like not being insane it's just like I
am I am getting smacked every time I
play also there were just hands where

[55:15]
play also there were just hands where
like people were just clearly outplaying
me as well
um
like I remember there was this one hand
like I actually won the hand but like
this this hand like scared the [ __ ] out
of me
um where it was like
it was like it was a freelance part
blind versus blind against Vicente and I

[55:32]
blind versus blind against Vicente and I
like I just flopped top set and we were
200 big blinds deep and I tripled off
for a stack uh and he called me down
with King High
um and I was like just for 200 Big lines
and I was like really aware when he

[55:45]
and I was like really aware when he
called me down that I'd been over
bluffing like like I I was sitting there
as he was tanky on the river just like
just like thinking I might get cold I
was thinking about it I was just like
wow I I like I'm actually really
overdoing this but I I I sort of only

[56:01]
overdoing this but I I I sort of only
just realized like how little I was
rapping
um and then like he flick he you know he
flicks in the call with King high and I
was just like I remember just being like
okay like
just one 10K and it feels [ __ ] great
but like but like I could I could feel
the you know I could just feel how out

[56:16]
the you know I could just feel how out
of my depth I was to be like you know to
be like playing pots with this guy like
he was just he was just clearly
completely smashing me
um yeah it was like freehanded with a
fish so I was still playing but it was
like uh like like I I hated that feeling

[56:30]
like uh like like I I hated that feeling
of just being like you you know just
having to like deal with the [ __ ]
someone was throwing at you like like I
was you know I was under no illusions
that I was the one creating problems
playing like that there was no way that
was happening
so this stage you're realizing that
you're a bit out of your depth and these

[56:45]
you're a bit out of your depth and these
guys are really good and there's a gap
between your strategy and theirs but you
can't really figure out exactly like how
to close it like where you actually lie
on the Spectrum compared to them so how
did you go about getting through the
space how did you learn to close the gap
all the things that you uh were focused
on during this period to catch up

[57:01]
on during this period to catch up
uh so so one thing was I joined uh
gorilla
uh which well I mean that that was like
honestly the main thing
um which helped so so [ __ ] much
um it's like all these all these guys

[57:15]
um it's like all these all these guys
like so many of them have been like
crushing high stakes for so long like
they're you know they're such top level
players
um
and it was like you know on on like on
the one hand it was also realizing that
like okay I'm seeing all these places

[57:30]
like okay I'm seeing all these places
where these guys are executing so so
well like I was fixating on that and I
was missing that like they are still
human you know they're they're these
guys like they are still Parts where
their strategy is falling short
um
the thing which is different is like

[57:46]
the thing which is different is like
it's like you know when you see like
these guys who play like
every steak it's like there will be
parts of the game through which they'll
execute absolutely amazingly
and then Parts where they're making
mistakes whereas I feel like when you're
at like one kill below basically

[58:01]
at like one kill below basically
everyone is you know to some extent
[ __ ] up every node like not not
necessarily by huge amounts but um and
it's not to say like the high stakes
guys they're like completely nailing
everything down to the accuracy of a
solver but like they they understand the

[58:15]
solver but like they they understand the
Dynamics with with
um generally a lot more fluency but like
there are still spots where there are
still spots where they they clearly like
are like a bit confused just because
like poke is like a really really
complex game and like having that
confidence to go like

[58:30]
confidence to go like
uh when someone messes up to not just go
oh this guy's exploiting me uh to not
have that instant reaction of like oh
like you know what whatever he's done
must be like must be explainable by like
coming up with some weird convoluted
process and it's just like talking to

[58:45]
process and it's just like talking to
some guys it's just like oh no but this
guy this guy has [ __ ] up
um and I also had like the opposite side
like there were things which I was
working on and I always just almost
thought they were too obvious to even
bother with I was just kind of trying to
like fine-tune stuff a bit and like but

[59:01]
like fine-tune stuff a bit and like but
then it's almost like ah what's the
point of like trying to run this line
like everyone knows the counters to it
anyway you know like like everyone's
just about like everyone just balance
everywhere and talking to people and
they're just like they're just like oh
no this is going to be like really
difficult to deal with like if you if

[59:16]
difficult to deal with like if you if
you like drag people to these spots like
they're you know there's a really high
chance people will make mistakes
um and so yeah yeah like like hearing
the hearing that these guys were even
gave me a lot more confidence I mean of
course of course there's also like you
know the technical side and like

[59:31]
know the technical side and like
listening to their thought process
um
like what one skill in particular was um
which I I'd really never thought about
because I'd always focused on the
technical side of my game but uh one

[59:45]
technical side of my game but uh one
thing which I Learned was like how to
isolate really important factors quickly
because
um
the amount of times I saw what looked
like a really complicated decision and
then someone could explain like how to
get to the right answer within like a

[1:00:00]
get to the right answer within like a
sentence because they'd got to you know
they they like the pattern recognition
for what was the deciding factor was so
so quick uh instead of trying to get
lost in like the weeds of like all of
these finer details and I think that
that was something which

[1:00:15]
that was something which
you know which really helped me because
I I I'd only been trying to make my
thought process more complicated I just
been trying to add like
letters and letters and letters to it
um instead like instead of actually like

[1:00:30]
um instead like instead of actually like
making it more streamlined you know so
sometimes the sometimes the answer is
simple
yeah so uh in practice how do you go
about doing that how do you go from a
complex think and complex strategy of
thinking all the the granular details to

[1:00:46]
thinking all the the granular details to
isolate and important factors what are
some of the things you found important
to condense and simplify your decision
making process so you could actually
make better decisions I mean one thing
was I I went away from the table uh and
looked at like I I actually started

[1:01:03]
looked at like I I actually started
thinking about
well actually uh like how much weight
should I give to everything
um
and trying to trying to assign a
priority to various factors rather than

[1:01:15]
priority to various factors rather than
because what I'd been doing in game
before was like okay I knew a bunch of
things which could have an impact on my
strategy
and then like
you know and then I just like think
about all of them and then I'd just be a
nurse maybe like free or saying go one
way free or going the other but then but
then sometimes it's like but that yeah

[1:01:31]
then sometimes it's like but that yeah
once you've done the work and you've
thought about like which ones are going
to supersede which other ones
uh and then suddenly like you know it's
one thing and it's like well I don't
even need to go down to it
reasons like two three six like this one
is just like like even if all everything

[1:01:46]
is just like like even if all everything
else disagrees this one will be strong
enough you know in an extreme example
um I mean yeah like getting used to that
yeah
can you remember any specific things
that uh you started to wait differently
in terms of this hierarchy let's say uh
every decision we've got like five to

[1:02:01]
every decision we've got like five to
ten things we can wait in terms of
Divisions oh where do you feel like
people make mistakes with their waiting
when they're trying to uh simplify which
which factors do people think are more
important yeah I'm trying to be coy I'm
doing exactly what I complained about
earlier not trying and trying not to

[1:02:15]
earlier not trying and trying not to
give too much away
um
I'd probably I'd probably say like one
of the things that um people put like
too much weight on is
like the exact frequency that your hand
has in theory

[1:02:31]
has in theory
um
because like one of the ways I always
look at it is like okay like
you know if this hand is showing up in a
line a lot like yeah you are giving
someone a lot of information but until
they adjust like it's just an option
um and like

[1:02:46]
um and like
um and so
and so like you know instead of instead
of spending so much time going like
oh this hand is his hand is supposed to
take this action exactly like you know
20 of the time just sort of going like

[1:03:01]
20 of the time just sort of going like
okay well this this is the main line for
this hand this is the sideline
uh and then like you know
and then and then immediately going to
okay is there anything which will break
that equilibrium and then like you know

[1:03:16]
that equilibrium and then like you know
if I can't get to that which of course
is gonna it's gonna happen a ton like
you can't like you can't just force
exploit every single spot
um but instead instead of trying to
instead of trying to do that uh well
yeah yeah if if I can't get to that and
then it's like okay well we can play
like I can play like a rough mix which

[1:03:32]
like I can play like a rough mix which
is going to be close enough that like No
One's Gonna Be able to you know no one's
gonna be able to work this out this
isn't going to sharpen my frequencies
because like you'll overestimate these
small things as often as you
underestimate them uh like it's
especially in six Max where you get like

[1:03:47]
especially in six Max where you get like
hidden in the crowd
um so yeah instead of trying to execute
everything on like a you know on a
theory perfect level just like get the
like like have have the theory like you
want you want the theory at a high
enough level that you can like execute

[1:04:01]
enough level that you can like execute
that almost on autopilot which is
obviously very hard and you need to do a
lot of technical work on that but then
it's like you know what once you know
once you know these are your options and
then it's like trying to use trying to
use my brain power to decide between
them and it's like yeah which is just

[1:04:16]
them and it's like yeah which is just
worth more because if you can make a if
you can make an adjustment for like one
BB compared to if you can take two
things which are like completely even EV
and then play the mix between them
slightly more precise it's like well
which one actually gains you really

[1:04:30]
which one actually gains you really
yeah it's almost like coming up with
simplified strategies that are easy to
execute that don't cost you EV and then
stress test the nose to see that you
haven't missed any variables in the way
and that would break that Assumption of
simplification yeah no it's just funny
you say simplify strategies because like
every single person I ever play or talk

[1:04:46]
every single person I ever play or talk
poker about says I play the most
needlessly complex strategy of all time
um like you know one of the things Doug
said to me immediately after the match
was just he was just like do you need to
use all these sizes like I feel like
it's not gaining you that much EV and I

[1:05:00]
it's not gaining you that much EV and I
was just like but it's fun like like you
know and I have a lot of practice with
it um you know it's like he like
you know he's not used to seeing someone
with like
you know like he doesn't even know how
many sizes I'm playing in a bunch of
different spots
um and so like whilst it will increase

[1:05:16]
um and so like whilst it will increase
the rate which I make errors like it'll
increase the rate which which they make
carrots and like I'm used to practicing
them but yeah yeah it's funny when you
say like you know using a simplified
abstract strategy because it's like like
I say this but you know at the same time
yeah I'm trying to I'm trying to like

[1:05:31]
yeah I'm trying to I'm trying to like
I'm trying to like lead people into into
the woods a little like I remember uh
there's a quote from mihal tal a uh a
chess Grandmaster who's like one of my
Idols in chess who's like incredibly
tactical aggressive player and he said

[1:05:45]
tactical aggressive player and he said
uh you must uh lead your opponent uh
deep into a dark Forest where there's
only the way out for one
and and I think that's uh that's kind of
a way where like I sort of tried to play

[1:06:00]
a way where like I sort of tried to play
poker where it's like I try to keep
things I try to keep things complex and
keep people on their toes like you know
and then just hope that I can hope that
I can make the right Play Slightly more
than them but you know it's not about
making the perfect play every time but
it's like if I if I make a more accurate

[1:06:17]
it's like if I if I make a more accurate
play 51 of the time you know like
suddenly I'm winning
um yeah it's an interesting interplay
between Simplicity that you can execute
well and then the complexity and taking
people into the woods as you've
explained it and playing kind of Street
poker where you make it difficult for

[1:06:31]
poker where you make it difficult for
them you take different lines that make
them uncomfortable and put them in
situations where you're hard to play
against but at the same time simplifying
for yourself so you can actually execute
those kind of interplays which are
challenging to get to I think it's a
good time for you to come in running I
know you think a lot about the way
attends at certain variables for

[1:06:45]
attends at certain variables for
decision making where do you feel like
players potentially over complicated
when they don't need to or oversimplify
and cost himself maybe that way
yeah it's funny because I've
talked strategy with people and I mean
we have people on the pulse and we have
them fill out a questionnaire and like

[1:07:00]
them fill out a questionnaire and like
how they we ask some questions
technically how they approach poker and
we have many people who are very
successful and they feel out completely
different things there is no I want to
point it out there's no one way that
it's correct because for example we're
talking about
in this case doc also pointing out Owen

[1:07:16]
in this case doc also pointing out Owen
why you make things so complex but
probably if you ask Owen oh and how
complex does it feel for you it's
probably not as complex as it would feel
for someone who who was simplifying
their strategy I can't be wrong here uh
oh but it doesn't actually feel that
complex for you

[1:07:30]
complex for you
well it's like
because I I'm just trying I'm trying to
think I'm always trying to think in like
words while I'm playing you know it's
like oh this hand would want to go into
a small bet line for this reason rather

[1:07:45]
a small bet line for this reason rather
than thinking about it as like this hand
is like a 20 small back 10 big bat like
70 check
um electronic like picture reasonable
lines for a hand and then I feel like
I've spent so much time practicing it
but even if

[1:08:00]
but even if
like the thing is that there is like a
really big gap between my again and C
game honestly and I think that part of
that is just because when I see gaming I
can get a bit lost in my own strategy
but when I'm a gaming I I have the
confidence that
um I'm gonna be able like I'm gonna be

[1:08:15]
um I'm gonna be able like I'm gonna be
able to
you know navigate around this more
efficiently than uh than my opponent is
yeah I can very strongly relate to to
what you're saying here also what you're
talking about like the frequency play or
something that is unfrequent I feel like

[1:08:30]
something that is unfrequent I feel like
a lot of people just say oh yeah but
this only happens five percent of the
time or in this spot the clearly
dominant sizing is just this so you just
should only play that but in my opinion
in these Sims if something happens let's
say there's one hand that specifically
wants to do something different than the

[1:08:45]
wants to do something different than the
rest of the strategy a lot of players
can say we should neglect that but I
actually think it's the opposite that
one hand apparently says something about
why like I would get fascinated about
that one hand like why does the that
hand go against the strategy what is the

[1:09:00]
hand go against the strategy what is the
what is that that hand achieving
differently in this sizing or with
display that goes against the strategy
now I'm not saying that you know we
should only focus on that hand but it
can teach us a certain concept that we
can then use into different scenarios as

[1:09:16]
can then use into different scenarios as
well which we can then use in the tables
for example let's say oh you got it in a
spot where people say oh I have to
arrange but this for small you say well
my default will be I'm gonna bet a lot
that's already different than range for
usually a small sizing but

[1:09:31]
usually a small sizing but
you should allow yourself some room to
think about what your hand actually
wants to do it's it's all a hands in
your range that lead it to mainly do
that but maybe you have a hand that
wants to actually go a different
direction
yeah I mean I same which I've which I've

[1:09:47]
yeah I mean I same which I've which I've
always liked to lean into is like
embrace your fantasy play Syndrome a bit
and it doesn't mean
it doesn't mean you want to make these
fancy plays for no reason
but
you know look into them like try and

[1:10:01]
you know look into them like try and
work out like you know why does this
exist like like why like you know what
happens if someone you know what happens
if we take this away
um and then you can you know you can see
like sometimes like sometimes these

[1:10:16]
like sometimes like sometimes these
things don't have extreme effect on
strategy but also you have these effects
where it's like
well just because you've just because
you're doing something a bit imprecisely
because you're in some weird line where
maybe you're not completely practicing

[1:10:30]
maybe you're not completely practicing
it and they still need to know the
answers
um it's like you know it's like there
are spots where someone gets to
um they get to like range betting
through about pots and like there's no
raising in position I was like well you
still need to know

[1:10:45]
still need to know
a good way to respond if someone raises
you because like there are players out
there you know like Stefan like Barry
like I mean obviously they're not in
everyone's games but like you look at
how they play and like I always think of
it as like you're sort of like prodding
your opponent's strategy like you you

[1:11:02]
your opponent's strategy like you you
just sort of ask them these questions
and it's like okay prove you know what
to do to make this not a play I can make
um and it's like if they don't know
if they don't know the answers it's like
okay suddenly this play is like

[1:11:15]
okay suddenly this play is like
completely fine and maybe even like the
optimal line for a bunch of hands
um and yeah I mean obviously it's like
the vast majority of players you're
playing aren't gonna try and test you in
that way
um
but yeah I think that's where like you
know that's where that's where you can

[1:11:30]
know that's where that's where you can
that's where you can get so much like
you don't necessarily like there's so
many there's so many players who like
focus on being solid and it's like
you're not gonna get a Big Easy Edge out
of them in uh in the main lines so
whilst you can't drag them to like these

[1:11:45]
whilst you can't drag them to like these
weird lines like every single hand it's
like it's like well this is you know
this is a chance to like out execute
someone I think that um I sort of like
tactics you know it's like it's like you
can't force someone
necessarily to make a mistake

[1:12:00]
necessarily to make a mistake
but um but you know that there are
things you can do which are like
massively win rate shifting if you like
if you can identify mistakes that
someone's making
yeah I like what you're explaining I
think there's also way more applies
let's say we are the aggressor that's
usually spots where we can decide the

[1:12:15]
usually spots where we can decide the
strategies where as if we're responding
to a certain strategy that someone lays
out kind of the approach is a little bit
different but what you were ex what you
were describing it was quite interesting
so let's say for example I do something
that's quote quote not a thing but let's

[1:12:30]
that's quote quote not a thing but let's
say I practice the strategy I'm like
okay I'm gonna do this thing that's not
a thing what should his adjustment be
he's likely to a screw up this
adjustment so now my thing becomes a
thing right and say what you said about
frequency I really like it like a
frequency play
I see it more as like it's a suggestion

[1:12:45]
I see it more as like it's a suggestion
you know it's an option that we could
take and then it's like okay this is
done with a certain frequency when would
this be very good and when would this be
very bad and that kind of opens up a
different way of thinking about the game
and I think a very big problem that a

[1:13:01]
and I think a very big problem that a
lot of players have is when you try to
just copy the solver
you stop thinking that's usually usually
one thing that happens is you need to
restart thinking about the game and then
actually you'll be like oh oh if you ask
yourself something ask yourself certain

[1:13:15]
yourself something ask yourself certain
better questions you will suddenly start
to think more creatively and better
Alliance will come out yeah like some of
my
like historic I can always I mean I
don't remember specifics but I always
remember the feeling of like after I've
done a patch of doing lots of study

[1:13:30]
done a patch of doing lots of study
I've always feel like there's like a
sort of um
there's a phase in between where you
studied all this new stuff but you don't
have the fluency and like my Play Feels
Like very robotic and this stuff isn't
well integrated it's almost like I've

[1:13:45]
well integrated it's almost like I've
forgotten uh forgotten how to deal with
playing like an actual human
um
were like
you know where where it's like things
are gonna be like largely more intuitive
from people they're not gonna be like

[1:14:00]
from people they're not gonna be like
like if someone like if a solver uses
the wrong size
like the wrong size it's like it's using
it with a perfectly balanced like one
percent range right
um whereas if you see that versus a you
know if you see that versus a human like
it's up to you then to decide like you

[1:14:15]
it's up to you then to decide like you
know what does what does this say about
the way they're playing
um which I think which I think is why
it's like so like so interesting the way
Stefan plays because it's like
like he just does stuff which is like so
off the Beaten Track like right from the

[1:14:31]
off the Beaten Track like right from the
start of hands like like you know he
just has like all these different
opening sizes like he'll just like see
back completely like completely like
theoretically wrong sizes just to just
to have as many nodes as possible

[1:14:46]
to have as many nodes as possible
from there on in where you don't know
what's happening
um and so it it yeah it means like
there's this there's this always
interesting Dynamic of like he's giving
up like he's giving up Theory but he's
trying to create enough tactics to
overcome it it's like you know like

[1:15:01]
overcome it it's like you know like
someone someone who's playing like solid
Fury could have like bass line strappers
your Strat they might be like beating
Stefan for like five BB and that's like
okay
but like you know can he find like you
know can he find like a 5bb adjustment

[1:15:15]
know can he find like a 5bb adjustment
once every hundred hands like you know
this this is like so challenging to play
against that like you know like he clear
he clearly does because he's got like a
he's got like a huge win rate enhance
for ads for a very long time yeah and
basically if you think about it where
most of your decisions will start is

[1:15:31]
most of your decisions will start is
with your opponent's range right because
you have to estimate okay how am I doing
against my opponent range but if he
keeps on doing all these things that you
have no clue what his range actually is
and he knows exactly what your range is
you're definitely in a disadvantage

[1:15:45]
you're definitely in a disadvantage
yeah it's like it's like sure he gets
owned sometimes but he just comes out on
the right side of it like yeah on the
right side a bit more often than not
um it's also like yeah like sometimes I
just see him
do things where it's like

[1:16:01]
do things where it's like
and then like someone will make the
exact mistake do you know like there's
something kind of beautiful about like
somewhere you know when someone shows
the exact hand which proves how like on
point is like his adjustment was uh and
I feel like I I feel like that's that's

[1:16:17]
I feel like I I feel like that's that's
like so fascinating for me to watch like
more so than like
you know to to like GTO Bots seeing how
close they can get to an equilibrium
um yeah yeah it stimulates the the more

[1:16:30]
um yeah yeah it stimulates the the more
creative side of your brain I would say
you you mentioned that uh at some point
when you were talking with Adam you
mentioned that you were still screwing
up a lot what were some leaks that you
had to overcome in order to yeah to sort

[1:16:47]
had to overcome in order to yeah to sort
of earn your place with the big boys
I was like
but the first thing I was like
I was like scared to fold because of

[1:17:01]
I was like scared to fold because of
people's names
and like like not even like not even
like not even like folding Theory
catches like like I was just like I just
had this image of like what a good
player was and I was like a good player
is someone who runs you over and then I

[1:17:16]
is someone who runs you over and then I
would just have hands which is just pure
folds in theory and I'd be scared to
fold them because I was like you know
that was just how I had this uh
to sort of like and I had to you know I
had to actually like you know work on
that and just not like

[1:17:30]
that and just not like
you know like thinking something Beyond
like
oh my God like I'm playing against Duty
like you know like like I can't fault to
duty he'll know
um like he'll know if I'm folding um and
it's like well yeah and so I was like I

[1:17:46]
it's like well yeah and so I was like I
was like going way way overboard which
is like I mean it happens to like so
many people when they move up in Stakes
is like they think um
they suddenly like they suddenly think
yeah everyone at the next stake is like
a psycho and can and can see like your

[1:18:00]
a psycho and can and can see like your
money scared it's like okay I have to
have to like rebel against this money
scared image so it's just like instead
of instead of being money scared I'm
just like handing them my role or like
every time they flop a hand
um like yeah obviously you just have to
be you know you have to be somewhere in
the middle like like if you're just yeah

[1:18:16]
the middle like like if you're just yeah
it like like is one thing hero calling
and then it's another thing just like
calling every catcher every time without
much subtlety and I think it's just like
you know these are smart guys they can
just see that you know they don't
necessarily know why I was doing it

[1:18:30]
necessarily know why I was doing it
right but like they you know they can
see it and like and then suddenly and
then suddenly like the mistake gets
accentuated because like these guys are
just very very quickly
um it's like you can only do that so
many times before you're never seeing a
bluff uh so yeah that was something
which I which I like had to get over

[1:18:46]
which I which I like had to get over
like like yeah especially when you start
calling things that are just never
recall it's it's usually alerts the
alarm but like if you call if you call a
frequency hand more often then like the
other person's like well this probably
if you can see oh if you call it always
it's very hard to figure out obviously

[1:19:01]
it's very hard to figure out obviously
over the long term your frequencies can
be a bit out of line but if you start
calling [ __ ] that's just never a thing
the other person's like oh interesting
yeah yeah
yeah I was just like
and I think yeah as well like I would
just like have like a decently strong

[1:19:16]
just like have like a decently strong
hand and then like you know if a good
player put me all in I wouldn't even
like really think I'd just be like I
have to call this guy and then like you
know later realize oh this hand is
actually like you know it's a strong
hand but like he's rapping stronger this
hand is a mix but like I would just have

[1:19:30]
hand is a mix but like I would just have
like Snapped the call button because I
just like ah he has Bluffs like you know
and it's like well I'm not really giving
them much incentive to find the Bluffs
like
you know yeah it's it's exactly also
what you were talking about with Adam as
well in terms of what is the deciding

[1:19:45]
well in terms of what is the deciding
factor especially
we always Focus so much on on Theory and
in theory everything is very close so
the side effect I think I think that's
also to come back to what Adam asked me
like for example overriding blockers on
blockers especially in sportswear where

[1:20:00]
blockers especially in sportswear where
we just have infinite combos to work
with like obviously in the solver it's
very important but in real life if you
play against the nits or someone who's
very aggressive or over aggressive
that's a way more deciding factor in
terms of what we should consider if you

[1:20:15]
terms of what we should consider if you
have the information and you play
against someone who's a nit yeah I don't
care which blocker you have or which
Unblocker you have it's probably
something not very useful to think about
I think um
yeah I think I think anyone studying
blockers before 5K is kind of wasting
their time

[1:20:30]
their time
like I think it's just
like they're so like they're so
unintuitive
they're like so many times I hear
um I hear people from like mid Stakes
talk about their blockers and and

[1:20:45]
talk about their blockers and and
they're just doing the opposite thing to
what they think they are because it's
like there's just so much you know
there's like so much going on with all
of these like tiny effects
um which like all like add up and like
this is the kind of thing which I was
like getting lost in
um and like trying to like perfectly

[1:21:00]
um and like trying to like perfectly
account for all this stuff
um
and and like I think yeah it clearly has
a place
um
but it's also it's like
uh I I I I think like there are so yeah
there are just so many people I've heard

[1:21:15]
there are just so many people I've heard
who who like spend all their time like
digging into the blockers in one like
insanely specific River spot and it's
just like
well like it it's a much bigger strap
mistake
to like to like not have to like have

[1:21:31]
to like to like not have to like have
like no Bluffs or like way too many
Bluffs than it is to like pick the
slightly wrong combos
um so like if you can identify like a
bunch of reasonable Combos and then like
sort of like you know it like even if
you don't like have an exploitive read

[1:21:46]
you don't like have an exploitive read
but you can go okay all these combos are
reasonable I can probably go with it
like about this much from all of them
and then just like you know be fearless
and adjust later rather than trying to
wait like work out the perfect one and
just be like okay like this is the one I
go and then like you'll be gaming for a

[1:22:00]
go and then like you'll be gaming for a
second and you miss it and then suddenly
like and then suddenly you're a net
because like you missed you missed this
like this like specific blocker combo
which was supposed to do something else
and then it's like okay well
you know now for this session I've just
been less aggressive than that I should

[1:22:16]
been less aggressive than that I should
be I saw like Phil golf on talking about
this thing where it's like the way he
rated his sessions was like
um you know what like one of them was
like how accurately he was playing but
also it's just like how much he was
like like the power I think he talked

[1:22:31]
like like the power I think he talked
about which is like going for spots like
you know going for spots fearlessly and
like not worrying like you know like
playing playing in a way which he knew
was like making Evie without being like
overly paranoid about the outcome and
stuff like that is like way more

[1:22:46]
stuff like that is like way more
important um to like keep up your
aggression to a proper level and like
force people to bait you off and like
force be like you know and win pots than
it is to like you know get some magical
blocker play like completely correct
yeah and also in your decision making
process let's say for example you look

[1:23:01]
process let's say for example you look
at spots like and you end up like this
is usually what happens to me like okay
this seems very close and that's when
it's already closed then suddenly like
smaller things can start to take place
like yeah okay this this hand is maybe

[1:23:16]
like yeah okay this this hand is maybe
not ideal but you arrived that by first
thinking about other variables and then
you arrive to the conclusion okay it's
very close and it's very close then we
could maybe see like okay well I have
this block I have that blocker maybe it
has an impact or you know or playing a

[1:23:30]
has an impact or you know or playing a
limp bot or a four bad Bots makes a big
difference yeah I mean they're obviously
going to be there are going to be spots
where like
blockers are like really important like
especially as as ranges get tighter
um
but but it's also like you know if if

[1:23:46]
but but it's also like you know if if
you
if you mess up the blockers that you're
bluffing with even in these spots where
they're like really good preferred
blockers but it's like but you still
have like a good overall aggression
level like your the the amount of like
Max EV that your Strat is losing is

[1:24:01]
Max EV that your Strat is losing is
still pretty small
um yeah compared compared to just uh
compared to just being like you know in
pursuit of perfection but just ending up
too tight because like the solver will
always do things which are which are
like too hard to find I think like that

[1:24:16]
like too hard to find I think like that
there are just always like these little
bits of aggression where it's like oh
you missed like you know five percent
here five percent there and it's like
okay well there's this one you know
really obvious combo which we rolled
like a perfect like 35 with it's like be
your your strategy is still passive you

[1:24:30]
your your strategy is still passive you
know you you because uh yeah because you
haven't picked up on these all these
little bears
you already mentioned uh
uh coaching a bit who in your career has
had a very big impact on your current

[1:24:45]
had a very big impact on your current
success and what do you recall being one
of the most important lessons that this
person has taught you
oh well um
definitely uh Yuri let's give a shout
out yeah well amongst like
other guys are gorilla like Bart's been

[1:25:00]
other guys are gorilla like Bart's been
uh Bart like grindcore has been amazing
as well
um
that's the most important
um
yeah I think I think the most important
thing was honestly just like hearing on
repeat until I believed that the high

[1:25:15]
repeat until I believed that the high
stakes players are humans too
um and just like having yeah and just
like having the confidence to yeah to go
out there and like try and work out what
is actually going wrong
um in this drop and it's like you don't
have to you know you don't I didn't have

[1:25:30]
have to you know you don't I didn't have
to do it necessarily for everyone off
the bat like I don't have to sit down
and then like you know like the first
time I'm playing 5K and trying like own
duty but like there are plenty of guys
who are like in a similar spot to me and
like don't just respect them because of
purpose of that uh in terms of

[1:25:45]
purpose of that uh in terms of
like strategy
um
so it just Springs to mind is like
learning from
um
learning from like Barack
um
just how important like
how important your execution of your

[1:26:00]
how important your execution of your
Strat is over just your knowledge of
your Strat
um because he plays like what is
Baseline like quite a simple
like a simple strategy to like
understand like what's going on and like
what what the ranges are but then his
execution within that Strat is

[1:26:17]
execution within that Strat is
so insanely High
um and so yeah that was kind of the
thing which got me
you know got me a bit more uh like
yeah a bit more focused away away from
like the weeds of things
um and like and like it was more yeah

[1:26:31]
um and like and like it was more yeah
it was more more about like like
picking up like all the info that I
possibly could
yeah and this is kind of a a trap that
you can fall in when trying to get
inspired Maybe by how other people play
one day you're like oh now I need to

[1:26:45]
one day you're like oh now I need to
play like stay from the other then we're
like no I need to play more like Barrack
we had uh we had Matt I love Avril
lavignon uh previous podcast uh and he
was also way more in in terms of the
simplified camp and like I said I think
also earlier
you will see successful players do

[1:27:01]
you will see successful players do
completely different things okay like in
the end it's going to be the execution
of your strategy that's going to
determine DV executed correctly you have
high V executed poorly uh poor AV
regardless of the strategy yeah yeah I
think um

[1:27:16]
think um
yeah I mean like there's even
there's guys who have like
like they smashed me heads up and I was
really confused until like I noticed
like eventually after being down so many

[1:27:30]
like eventually after being down so many
buy-ins because I was like really
confused because his strategy did not
seem like
that you know like like that insane like
he was clearly making Theory errors but
I was like really struggling and it's
like you know it's what I was saying
earlier about like always being in the

[1:27:45]
earlier about like always being in the
tank and like you know you're just all
like always feels like there's pressure
on like you're you're just not winning
very many parts
um I just realized like after a while
um after recording a session I was just
like oh he's he's a timing tell god
um like this guy has like this guy is

[1:28:01]
um like this guy has like this guy is
spending so little mental RAM on
I mean like like oh don't get me wrong
like this guy's still playing like fine
but like I was just like I was like how
am I losing to a guy who's like you know
he's making an easy mistake here an easy
mistake there uh and then he's just like

[1:28:15]
mistake there uh and then he's just like
completely like smashing me on timing
towels which is like I only realized
like after I'd lost like a bunch of
money to him
um I was just like okay okay I need to
you know I need to pay attention against
this guy like he's just owning me like
he's only me so hard in this like in
this area where

[1:28:30]
this area where
you know it's like it's like you sort of
project how you think about Pokemon to
other people it's just like oh wow like
you know I'm thinking of it as like you
know a chess game and trying to
complicate the position and then he's
doing that thing of like he's going
straight to something which just
supersedes everything else where it's

[1:28:45]
supersedes everything else where it's
just like oh I took some like weird
timing which allows me to hand read me
down to like
very specific range and then he could
make a very accurate decision against
that range and which is why I was always
in like constantly in these tough spots
and like
one of the things which is always like

[1:29:00]
one of the things which is always like
scary if you're playing someone heads up
is when you have a combination of
um you know you are seeing some huge
Blast from them but you're also getting
like value tricks where they're like
massively over playing hands and then
they're also like giving up some pure

[1:29:16]
they're also like giving up some pure
Bluffs in other spots where it would
have looked in buying and you had the
hand
um and like you have like all this going
on and it's like it feels like the guy's
inside your head yeah yeah especially
when you when you when you when you call
light in a spot where he went in and

[1:29:31]
light in a spot where he went in and
then you were like okay now I'm this is
the spot I'm going to call him and then
he gives up it's like um
I I had like there was one like really
specific animal I didn't even like I
hadn't even made a hand but I was just

[1:29:46]
hadn't even made a hand but I was just
like so sure I was calling down and like
the guy like Snap gave up like a pure
follow through and I was just like I
just felt like I was just like wait how
am I like how was he like how has he
done this because it like he felt like
uh like the rest of them actually being
like super super aggro and I was like

[1:30:00]
like super super aggro and I was like
wait how is he like how's he not gone
with his hand like um and then I yeah
and that was the kind of thing which
made me get like really paranoid and
start like recording this actually and
going over afterwards and I was like oh
like okay I guess I was just like I was
just making all my obvious decisions
within like one second and then like you

[1:30:17]
within like one second and then like you
know tanking when I actually had one I
was like okay like maybe I need to maybe
I need to be a bit more like respectful
of that area of the game like just
because I haven't worked on it doesn't
mean it's not a way that someone can
generate a win right yeah it's an
interesting point you guys obviously

[1:30:31]
interesting point you guys obviously
let's say you evaluate someone's level
you evaluated Through The Eyes that
you're evaluating with like oh I look at
this look at this game theoretically he
makes this a lot of mistakes but let's
say he's still a big winning player well
there's more most probably there's
indeed an area like for example what you

[1:30:45]
indeed an area like for example what you
mentioned with timing tells that you
don't really evaluate in terms of when
evaluating how good a player is but if
he's still winning and to you terms of
like he's a good player he's actually
not a good player then what's going on
probably something to learn there yeah
yeah yeah it's like uh

[1:31:02]
yeah yeah it's like uh
well one of the things which I've always
um
sort of tried to bear in mind is like
um that you don't want to like I hear so
often like poker players talk about how
[ __ ] everyone else is they're always

[1:31:15]
[ __ ] everyone else is they're always
just like oh like he's just a dirty Sun
Runner I don't know how he's playing
these stakes and like sure some people
are running well like some people are on
heaters but I think also like
even if you don't think someone's good
there's probably areas of the game that
they're executing really really well in

[1:31:31]
they're executing really really well in
um and so to always keep an open mind
like be prepared to learn from your
competition so basically you can almost
learn more from people who play bad but
who are winning because apparently in

[1:31:45]
who are winning because apparently in
terms of your evaluation you think
they're bad but they're winning so
probably there's something you can learn
there yeah yeah I mean there's also like
there can also be these sort of rock
paper scissors effects where like
um
you know you can have a winner against
someone because you sort of match up
well against them stylistically but like

[1:32:02]
well against them stylistically but like
I mean even just on a really simple
level there are some people who I know
who are like they're insane exploiting
fish
like they they take lines and like win
pots from fish that uh like like get

[1:32:15]
pots from fish that uh like like get
their stack so so fast and so it's like
if you're if you're at the table with
them it's not necessarily your win rate
within like a given hand is like
massively affected but it's like you're
just going to get less hands against
this [ __ ] because this guy's gonna

[1:32:30]
this [ __ ] because this guy's gonna
stack them first like so so consistently
um and so then it's like and then when
you start evaluating win rate in six
places like they could be they could be
winning by Molly and I was saying
actually yeah we're trying to neglected
for ages yeah actually that was
something which um
which growing core uh Bart taught me

[1:32:47]
which growing core uh Bart taught me
um
was like he had all of the like he could
he can pick up so much info on a fish uh
and he'll just be able to like he'll
he'll be able to tell you what mood
they're in from like just from like how

[1:33:02]
they're in from like just from like how
quickly they're acting pre-flop
um just be like oh this guy like you
know he limped really fast and like he
snapped called when I like I said him
and it's just like clearly you know
clearly he's in like a bit more of a
gambling mood like this is likely like a

[1:33:17]
gambling mood like this is likely like a
very gambly hand which really shouldn't
be here like you know like this is
probably a bit tilted this is more seven
free suited than like ten nine suited
sort of sort of range it's just like
this stuff like never even occurred to
me you know like this sort of like level

[1:33:30]
me you know like this sort of like level
of insight into how someone is um you
know how someone is thinking about the
game but like obviously you know with
this you can draw these like really
really strong assumptions I mean like
you know also like he has like
you know amazing uh
you know like there's amazing fairy

[1:33:46]
you know like there's amazing fairy
sighting you can also you can do this to
ranks as well but it's just like fish
like there's such a
proper bound to how much you can uh
fit to like how far you can go in that
regard
actually I noticed this especially also
with uh

[1:34:00]
with uh
what you mentioned with timing let's say
I I make a video or play something at
lower Stakes I see this way more often
where I evaluate players playing at
lower Stakes I'm like whoa time McDowell
here like every everything is like oh
everyone is just play every time telling
you exactly what kind of range they have

[1:34:15]
you exactly what kind of range they have
but when you move up then I do my
day-to-day game and I'm like I don't
already see that I don't already see it
as much as I see at lower Stakes
yeah I think I think as well like
I mean I always sound like
uh incredibly condescending but like

[1:34:31]
uh incredibly condescending but like
lowest takes place kind of have a bit
less to think about
you know like so it's like their timing
tells naturally get less balanced
because like there's less they're
thinking about less with their strategy
you know a lot of the time I think like
people just like
you know if you just take like an

[1:34:46]
you know if you just take like an
extreme example you go down to 10 now if
a guy flops an open Endo he's just gonna
bat it you know like there's not really
like evaluating all these other lines so
I think sometimes people at high stakes
sort of get balanced in this regard a
bit by accident
um because it's like it's like they're

[1:35:01]
um because it's like it's like they're
actually that there just is there is
enough to their strategy that like you
know even the obvious decisions they're
like questioning them and like making
sure like making sure it's not just
obvious but it's but it's correct as
well
um rather than just like autopilot
clicking

[1:35:15]
clicking
I'm always curious uh what successful
player like yourself what does a
day-to-day look like in the life of Owen
um
it's pretty inconsistent these days to
be honest

[1:35:30]
be honest
um maybe back in the time when you were
more consistent
I don't really think that's ever been
thing actually
um I don't know I kind of yeah I get up
and just like see what mood I'm in to be
honest if I'm

[1:35:45]
honest if I'm
I'm usually in the mood to play but I
don't really have set days off just if I
if I just don't have the energy for it I
take a day off but like I feel like that
leaves me playing
a lot more and also feeling less burnt
out because I don't feel like obligated
to play at all I'm always just like

[1:36:00]
to play at all I'm always just like
playing just because I'm motivated
um and you're motivated enough in
general to that it doesn't suffer from
any volume issues
I mean I've just always been in quite a
low volume place to be honest like I
um yeah I remember I was like

[1:36:18]
um yeah I remember I was like
there's a time when I was like I was
like playing 200 NL or something it's
almost like advertising a cfp
um and I talked to him about it and one
of the first things they said is you
have to play 50 000 hands a month

[1:36:31]
have to play 50 000 hands a month
I was just like
I was like uh I can give you 30 000.
back then and this is when I was playing
Zoom as well I was like I can play like
and they're like no no you have to play
50k to be part of it I was just like I
will just punt if I play those many that
many yeah I don't think that is the for

[1:36:46]
many yeah I don't think that is the for
example when I had my cfp I didn't have
any I would just agree I want to see
like the effort being put in of a
professional poker player but yeah some
people are just naturally better at
playing more tables less Stables putting
in more volume so if exactly if I'm

[1:37:00]
in more volume so if exactly if I'm
going to force more hands onto someone
it's maybe not the correct way like if
someone is only playing five thousand
hands in less three months I'm gonna
point out Hey listen yes it's not
correct but if someone puts in 300K
hands I will probably also say hey buddy

[1:37:15]
hands I will probably also say hey buddy
maybe we should tweak tweak something
here
yeah I mean it's it's like
ah like I think one of the things when I
was like
like back when I was like on it on a
downswing I was like sort of
exacerbating it because I

[1:37:31]
exacerbating it because I
I wanted to make all the money back
so I was uh so I was playing like
so I was playing like six tables uh or
like like as much action as I could get
like I'd have like four or 5K tables
open and then like two 1K tables on the

[1:37:46]
open and then like two 1K tables on the
side
uh and then like when I go on a
downswing from 5K I would then have like
you know 10 or like maybe sometimes even
more 1K tables open which I know to some
people isn't even that insane but I just
can't handle that many tables and I

[1:38:00]
can't handle that many tables and I
start playing really badly because it's
like it's not like my you know
it's not like the way I want to play
changes like I'm still trying to play
like on this like you know on a knife
edge of like you know between like
punting and brilliant

[1:38:15]
punting and brilliant
um
but then you're playing like 10 tables
and like the balance starts quickly
shifting towards planting because
there's a reason these players are low
frequency you know yeah yeah it's I
think I think the more standardized your
game is the more tables you can handle
and the more room for creativity you

[1:38:31]
and the more room for creativity you
allow yourself the Yeah the more you
just are capped with a certain amount of
table certain amount of volume yeah I
mean there are some guys who like
I think it's like Cameron couch or ishta
um who he plays like 12 tables of 1K

[1:38:47]
um who he plays like 12 tables of 1K
and he still seems to play it like like
a pretty like you know pretty good level
like like he's clearly like thinking
through hand he doesn't feel like he's
on autopilot and like that just blows my
mind like it's it's obviously like you
know it's a different type of skill to

[1:39:01]
know it's a different type of skill to
you know some of these like high-stakes
guys who can play like one table to like
you know they're trying to play one
table well not necessarily one table but
they're trying to play like two maybe
three tables perfectly but like he's
playing 12 tables to like a really high
efficiency and it's like I I don't think
I I don't think I have that in me but I

[1:39:17]
I I don't think I have that in me but I
think it's also good to know if that's
what your strength is then for example
uh like like for example GG you can
probably make a lot of money with the
leaderboard uh you get a lot of tables
but if that's not your skill then by all
means play last Stables move up and in

[1:39:32]
means play last Stables move up and in
the end you could still make the same EV
whereas if Easter would maybe do what
you're doing and you're doing what Isha
doing it's probably you're probably both
gonna end up with a lot less money
there's no down swings as well as well
like but they last longer is the problem

[1:39:47]
like but they last longer is the problem
like you're playing like less tables at
a high win rate you know it's obviously
less likely that things go horribly
wrong but like when they do it feels
like you're living in slow motion I can
only imagine what it's like for these
Live players yeah go on like a six month
downswing like you know all the time

[1:40:03]
downswing like you know all the time
yeah I feel like that would be that'd be
too much for me you like met many many
players you're obviously also very big
into the solvers but in the same time
you mentioned that you always try to

[1:40:15]
you mentioned that you always try to
exploit as much as possible where
wherever possible how did solverts or
how do solvers and exploitation
complement each other in your opinion
well I mean you can like
if no one's ever done this they should
do this as an exercise just go into a

[1:40:30]
do this as an exercise just go into a
solver and put in your strap at like
even a simple node just put in your
Stratton and just look like one how
extreme the solver response is going to
look like especially if you're playing
like 50 NL or something
um you're probably going to see like you

[1:40:45]
um you're probably going to see like you
you'll probably get like the solver's
probably going to start range but I
think like it's uh I mean like like
that'll probably even happen to high
stakes players because like the the
air will probably even be plus or minor
TV but like the the like distance from
the distance from mixing will probably
be less for them but yeah you can see um

[1:41:02]
be less for them but yeah you can see um
you know you can just put that into a
sovereign you can you can see like these
really insane responses
yeah it sort of goes hand in hand and
then also like
yeah I mean I mean yeah like node
locking like everyone's well aware of it

[1:41:18]
locking like everyone's well aware of it
but you can um you can try and like run
some complex uh you can try and like run
some more complex stuff like you can
you know you can see how like okay well
like if we take away these things if we

[1:41:30]
like if we take away these things if we
take away these options earlier in the
tree does it have an impact on like the
late stages of the tree which is where I
think like the benefits of playing like
complex game trees can come from
um because it will have like unexpected
effects on like what the ranges look

[1:41:45]
effects on like what the ranges look
like later down later down the game
three and if you can picture them
um if you can picture them and like and
also I tend to have a good intuition for
like
um how a spot is gonna feel to someone
who hasn't studied it which I don't

[1:42:00]
who hasn't studied it which I don't
think is something you can really like
you can really teach I just think that
saying which I like happen to do quite
well
um
and so and so yeah I'm usually pretty
good at picking out like
like I can guess how I think like
oftentimes you know like like okay if

[1:42:17]
oftentimes you know like like okay if
someone doesn't know what's if someone
doesn't know what's going on here what's
a likely mistake they make and then like
from there you can start engineering
more stuff it's just like okay like
someone else who studied like what's
their adjustment and then you know you
can you can learn the exploit to be out

[1:42:30]
can you can learn the exploit to be out
to your own bass exploit and then you
can also yeah you can like sit there and
like you can do the opposite and you can
like go go into the weeds of like all
this like you know all these leveling
Wars but if you can pick out the right
level to be on uh and like you
understand what like what each level

[1:42:45]
understand what like what each level
means for for like how it's going to
change your combos then uh then yeah
like that's that's how you can use you
can still you can use solvers to play
like a very non-solver Strat yeah it
definitely sounds like you're not
looking at the the solver output did I

[1:43:00]
looking at the the solver output did I
play my hand correctly or okay what do I
do here and okay try to execute you're
really and you know we both mean and
we're also definitely in that camp way
more looking at like okay what kind of
variables impact this strategy what if I
change this variable whatever and that's

[1:43:15]
change this variable whatever and that's
what it might be and when you really
start to learn poker saying what you
said if you remove maybe a future sizing
how does my current strategy on for
example the turn let's say he cannot
overbed the river let's say it doesn't
overbear the river how does my turn
strategy change if I'm not gonna face
that over bed on the river for example

[1:43:31]
that over bed on the river for example
these are interesting variables uh to
play around with and in my opinion in
that process is when you really start to
understand poker like what impact do the
variable have that let the strategy that
I'm seeing here on my screen lead to be

[1:43:45]
I'm seeing here on my screen lead to be
this way and what if I change the
variables to something that is more
common
you know like sometimes you can uh you
can learn a lot by like accidentally
running a really bad sim yeah yeah true
but you can just you can just run a Sim

[1:44:01]
but you can just you can just run a Sim
where for some reason like your race
sizes are just [ __ ] and then you just
see like how this impacts like you know
you can manipulate the sort of pot sizes
that someone is allowed to play

[1:44:15]
that someone is allowed to play
and then if you can see some weird thing
where like someone has like you know
they have a specific hand where it's
like
you know if it raises you it then like
like it has like weird River options
which don't suit this hand so it can't
like it can't go into this line and then

[1:44:30]
like it can't go into this line and then
like you can sort of like transplant
that onto onto someone else you get like
when you start realizing you know you
get like a pattern for like what sizes
do they use here where are they getting
the sizes a bit wrong like if like if I
were to give them wrong sizes which I
think is like
you know saying which people can easily

[1:44:45]
you know saying which people can easily
Miss if they're studying from just the
same Library
um but yeah it's kind of one of one of
the funny things because yeah when I
first came up and I was like running my
own Sims and I like random wrong so many
times and then like you know you you run
like a better version of it and then you
see how it differs and uh and yeah that

[1:45:00]
see how it differs and uh and yeah that
can be a learning experience whereas
like you know now we're doing gorilla
and they have like this amazing library
of all these Sims to to just uh to use
and to look through but it's like but
like yeah if I jump straight to that
then I I could have missed all that sort
of like fumbling around but you

[1:45:15]
of like fumbling around but you
accidentally get some some gems yeah you
can also learn a lot sometimes you know
you try to play around because you want
to maybe find like a certain output
you're like oh actually I think this
happens and then you want to say no no
if we change this this is going to
happen and then it doesn't happen mine

[1:45:30]
happen and then it doesn't happen mine
doesn't happen and then you suddenly see
oh oh he solves it by I remember for
example it was with um
I believe it was I was looking at a
blind first blind spot and I was like
okay let's let's remove the three bet

[1:45:45]
okay let's let's remove the three bet
option versus a race for the out of
position player so he Betsy race he
cannot three bets and I was like well
then we should probably just raise range
right that was my my natural conclusion
so I have put that in and it's like it's
not raising range what the [ __ ] going
on I'm looking look at the turn oh

[1:46:01]
on I'm looking look at the turn oh
basically it's calls and dunk bets every
turn so I have to first remove the the
thing and then freaking out so it's it I
had a lot of these kind of situations
where you would play around like why is
it not doing oh it found it found it
found the it found a way a work around

[1:46:15]
found the it found a way a work around
you know like yeah also in restricting
the solver you can also learn a lot
about like what are okay well he cannot
do this this is his preference but if we
remove this preference then how does he
solve it in a different note and then
often you can find really really

[1:46:30]
often you can find really really
interesting things
yeah yeah yeah completely I remember
also like yeah there's this one time
where I was uh
like there was a bluff which I really
wanted to be explosively right like um
and I was like I remember just playing

[1:46:47]
and I was like I remember just playing
around with the same for so [ __ ] long
trying to get this to work uh and it was
like it was not only not using my combo
but like my combo was like the furthest
distance from being used still and it

[1:47:01]
distance from being used still and it
was like I was like okay like you know
thank God I've uh I've tried so hard to
get this to to get this to work I like
this is like a clear you know clear do
not do this under any circumstances but
like I've uh you know I've learned my

[1:47:15]
like I've uh you know I've learned my
lesson like I don't need to you know
this fancy players one weekend one
weekend Shelf yeah sometimes the Sumo
science is trying to trying to get get
this over to give you the validation
that what you do is Right usually you're
trying to be right in your hand but you
actually

[1:47:30]
actually
walk away from your your study session
with a completely different new new
thing that you learned uh and the actual
hand that you were looking up ended up
being yeah useless anyway or in your
case no matter what you chase it ended

[1:47:46]
case no matter what you chase it ended
up being a big pot
uh what are your what in your opinion is
the best thing a player can do to
increase the Envy of that career

[1:48:01]
um
so I mean in terms of in terms of
studying
I would say
so like I'm like really into like theory
of planning stuff
and one of the things which I always saw

[1:48:15]
and one of the things which I always saw
is that you learn
you like learn much better when you
articulate how you're thinking properly
before you study something
so if you if you before looking at a
spot you like get a clear handle

[1:48:30]
spot you like get a clear handle
on how you assume the spot to look
and then when you see all the places you
were wrong it's like you know it's like
if you do a test and then you get the
test back and then it's like you you
never forget the questions you get wrong
you know like like it's easy to you know

[1:48:46]
you know like like it's easy to you know
it it'll like stick out in your brain in
like a much more visceral way and like
that's better than just going into
things
like like it you you just have much
better recoil of information looking at
things like that so that's um saying I'd
recommend for studying um

[1:49:01]
recommend for studying um
terms of
career advice
um
[Music]
I'd probably say like yeah it's it's
important to find people to bounce ideas
off even if you don't want uh even if

[1:49:16]
off even if you don't want uh even if
you don't want like a really big group
it's really important to have people
sign the t-check here
um
because like sometimes I would develop
these assumptions
um
or like sometimes you you can even you

[1:49:31]
or like sometimes you you can even you
can you can have the opposite where it's
like you don't think someone's making a
mistake as it like you don't realize
that something you're doing is hard
um like someone it's like you'll you'll
learn something
and then it's easy to forget what it was

[1:49:46]
and then it's easy to forget what it was
like not knowing that
um because it because it is fully
integrated and it becomes this
unconscious competence
uh but then if you have if you have a
group of people around you they can
they can sort of keep you you know

[1:50:00]
they can sort of keep you you know
grounded in in knowing that like okay
this thing which I've spent all this
time to learn
was yeah this was actually difficult
this actually is uh and you should you
know you should be approaching it to you
you should be pushing it as hard as you
can against like against the people who

[1:50:15]
can against like against the people who
you have evidence don't know
um and yeah so I think like having a
having a group around you stops you
getting uh
stops you getting dragged into this sort
of like thing where
like for me personally at least I I
always felt like I was playing against
myself when I was playing like it if

[1:50:32]
myself when I was playing like it if
there were like it's like everything I'd
do would be like a reflection of like
you know like what I thought I was doing
like if I knew how to Bluff a spot it's
like okay well clearly we have to call
here if I didn't know how to Bluff a
spot it's like okay well I failed

[1:50:45]
spot it's like okay well I failed
um and it's like that's not you know
like people are giving you so much
evidence about what they know like you
don't just want to
um you need to take that on board and
not just take everything as a given so
you're basically explaining
like kind of the issue of projection and

[1:51:02]
like kind of the issue of projection and
then yeah it's like it's like yeah it's
projecting um like like projecting both
your own mistakes and your own like and
your own knowledge onto other people
yeah it's it's it's it's it's definitely
a curse like you you you figure out this

[1:51:16]
a curse like you you you figure out this
cool thing you know and gives you like a
boost of confidence like oh and then
within a month you kind of project like
oh well now probably everyone knows it
and you you kind of lose maybe some
confidence in it how did you go about uh
fixing that

[1:51:31]
fixing that
uh so one thing I did some uh some
sessions with uh Jared tandler doing
some like mental game stuff just to make
sure
just to make sure that wasn't part of my
like you know um like unconscious

[1:51:45]
like you know um like unconscious
assumptions who
um
and I think also as well it's like
you know like hearing uh
like hearing the way that like Duty will
talk about a guy with like a you know
this guy's got like a 2bb win rate of 5K

[1:52:00]
this guy's got like a 2bb win rate of 5K
now and it's just like you know if you
if you have if you heard how he thinks
of like the mistakes this guy's making
it's like ah you might think he was
talking about 25 an hour wreck
um and eventually eventually that kind
of you know eventually that kind of
sinks in like okay like these are you

[1:52:16]
sinks in like okay like these are you
know obviously these are hard things
that they're messing up these are like
five Canal regs
um but like they are they are making
yeah yeah they are like making these
mistakes
um so yeah like like you you can you can
comment it from both sides both like

[1:52:30]
comment it from both sides both like
they're they're humans like making
making a lot of mistakes but also that
um but but also also like they might be
doing things battling you so so you know
being like you know looking at both like
like just because just because I find a
spot hard doesn't mean it's hard for

[1:52:45]
spot hard doesn't mean it's hard for
them
uh but also just because I find a spot
easy doesn't mean it's easy for them
yeah you have to realize that we
basically all of our strengths and our
weaknesses yeah yeah and like you wanna
you you don't want to like you don't
want to just write off your own
strengths and say oh everyone's strong
in this area because your weaknesses

[1:53:01]
in this area because your weaknesses
still exists you don't get to write off
your own weaknesses so you need to you
need to be able to play to your
strengths as much as like work on your
weaknesses
yeah I would say this has definitely
been a big point that I've always
struggled with like that I think okay
something is great but then I kind of

[1:53:15]
something is great but then I kind of
lose trust in it because I kind of
assume that this is general knowledge
now and it may be also a good time for
you to jump in you know you're you're a
mental game coach help us out here yeah
I think understanding cognitive devices
as a category is important knowing that

[1:53:31]
as a category is important knowing that
the Mind makes shortcuts and it
generally uh does work around similar to
a solver that can lead to some kind of
deviations and thoughts so you guys are
talking about projection bias where
generally it's like the curse of
knowledge when we know something we
assume that other people know the same
information so we give it less credit or

[1:53:46]
information so we give it less credit or
less value also we project our ideas and
what we know under the people we expect
other people to behave how we will
behave so we'll raw reverse scenario and
put ourselves in that scenario and say I
would have done this therefore my
opponent should do this so we can see
how many problems this can cause other

[1:54:01]
how many problems this can cause other
pocket tables when we realize people
think differently and not let go so I
think with biasis most important thing
is become aware of them and the ones
that you full victim to I think we all
had biases in certain areas and then how
do they make you deviate your thought
processes your ways of thinking as their

[1:54:15]
processes your ways of thinking as their
own did go and do some work deeply with
Jared 10 Lauren looking at unconscious
kind of thoughtful patterns yeah I
really understand about advice is you
fall victim to most of us fall victim to
confirmation bias to some degree outcome
bias in terms of looking at results in
the short term short-term gratification
is another bias that is very strong in

[1:54:32]
is another bias that is very strong in
the human psyche so understanding them
there's a book called thinking and
systems which goes into uh the kind of
overview of how the brain works and
these biases if you guys want to go
deeper but I think it's a definitely an
important part of Poker and
understanding where you might be uh and
make advice is that cause deviations

[1:54:48]
hi guys Renee aka the weko here with a
quick mechanics of Poker 2.0

of course is the technical aspect of the
game in which I'll be explaining you all
the mechanics behind poker strategies
we'll be talking about GTO exploitive
play with an extra focus on the why

[1:55:16]
play with an extra focus on the why
behind certain strategies and why the
population has certain leaks and to
increase your win rate even further
we've recently added a River Bluff and
Bluff catching section so you can
increase your in V when those spots
become very big our mindset and

[1:55:31]
become very big our mindset and
performance coach Adam Carmichael he
took care of the mental game and
performance section of this program in
which he will teach you everything you
need to know in order to break through
limiting beliefs better handle your
emotions break free from tilt and play

[1:55:46]
emotions break free from tilt and play
your A game more consistently lead and
last but not least we've added the
management and optimization section in
the program in which we will give you
various tips and tricks to make it more
likely for your poker career to succeed
and how to continuously improve as a

[1:56:03]
and how to continuously improve as a
poker player now on top of that this
concept is continuously evolving based
on feedback and suggestions we get from
our community next to all this content
you will have access to our exclusive

[1:56:15]
you will have access to our exclusive
Discord Community monthly live q a calls
and one-on-one coaching session in which
we are going to be reviewing if you have
been implementing the stuff that we
teach you in the mechanics of Poker
correctly so do you think you have what

[1:56:31]
correctly so do you think you have what
it takes to master the mechanics of
Poker go over to mechanicsofpoker.com
and maybe you will get a chance to work
with me and Adam and make more progress
in your poker career but for now without
further Ado let's get back into more

[1:56:46]
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode
so following from this I want to talk
about what you mentioned earlier and
when you mentioned get a big gap between
your A game and your c-game maybe some
biases come up here I'm sure a lot of
players can relate to this especially
you exploit guys who uh go for your big

[1:57:00]
you exploit guys who uh go for your big
reads and spots what are some of the
challenges you experience when you have
drifted to your ear game let's start
you'll see a game when you've noticed
you've dropped off your ear game what
are some of the challenges you
experience
uh so one of the
one of the main things

[1:57:16]
one of the main things
um
was trying to again too hard
because I think uh like my a game is
like
you know I have like I have plenty of
theory but there's also plenty of
creativity you know it's going hand in
hand

[1:57:30]
hand
I'm not trying to force anything
um and then
slip down to b game maybe like you know
a little bit low energy for some reason
I'm not competing as hard
um but then it's like

[1:57:45]
um but then it's like
and then you start like maybe you start
running a bit badly uh and then there's
a desire or like make a mistake because
I'm on b game and I miss something which
I know I'm capable of seeing
um and then and so then there's a desire

[1:58:00]
um and then and so then there's a desire
to make up for that mistake
um and to make a good play to outweigh
the bad one but that doesn't necessarily
mean that a good spot is going to come
up
there might be plenty of spots coming up
where you just have to play properly
like like there is no you know there is

[1:58:17]
like like there is no you know there is
no insane
like Bluff View to run here there's no
like hero call like like you know like
this is like you just have to
like you you just have to play
accurately for a bit and like wait

[1:58:30]
accurately for a bit and like wait
patiently but like when when I've been
in that mindset of like oh I've made a
mistake I need to like prove to myself
that I'm a good player Again by making a
good play
um
I was talking to Jared about this and
like the thing which he pointed out to
me was that um

[1:58:46]
me was that um
you don't prove you're a good player by
doing something High variants on it
going right
because
even if you take this High variance line
and it goes right like you know think
about how do you feel after that when
the line wasn't strictly accurate you

[1:59:00]
the line wasn't strictly accurate you
know it doesn't feel satisfying you just
feel lucky so then you just remain on
tilt so it's like I'm I'm taking on this
variants as an attempt to solve my tilt
like unconsciously without realizing
that and then like I take it on and it's
it's like high variance minor TV and

[1:59:16]
it's like high variance minor TV and
then even if it goes right uh it doesn't
it doesn't fix anything the way to fix
it is actually like by playing well
um which is you know easy said than done
but like you know having having an
awareness that I'm in that state where
like I need to like play solidly and I

[1:59:31]
like I need to like play solidly and I
need like a high degree of certainty
than normal to get out of line because
I'm not in I'm not in the sharpest
mindset whereas like there are you know
there are other times where you can be
feeling really sharp like poker feels so
fun like that one it's just also fluid

[1:59:45]
fun like that one it's just also fluid
like like it's you know all of these
ideas are coming to me like they seem so
great like they're all they're all
working out
um
and it's like you know it's like the you
know wanting to be in that state because
that is where I'm having the most fun
it's also where I'm making the most
money uh doesn't necessarily mean that

[2:00:01]
money uh doesn't necessarily mean that
you can you can just play like that just
by telling yourself to sometimes
sometimes you need to play like a bit
more solidly and then oftentimes what I
found is like if I if I just play solid
like really focus on playing with Fury
for a little bit just making sure
everything

[2:00:15]
everything
I've got everything like you know in
that in that way fine like for a little
bit I am just here to stack the fish
um and then it's like the spot will just
come up organically and I notice it and
then suddenly it's like oh like I'm you
know I can feel myself sharpening up
again
um instead of instead of trying to force

[2:00:31]
um instead of instead of trying to force
it
yeah I think that process you went
through it was very important and it was
noticing that you were trying too hard
when you're in your sea game to almost
prove yourself back to your aegm and not
trying too hard is even create more
errors in your strategy so understanding

[2:00:45]
errors in your strategy so understanding
that age to want to try hard and then
protecting yourself against it so in
terms of like practically in-game you
mentioned like just playing solid for a
period of time when that's even spotted
it let's say you become more aware of it
in-game and you notice you're in your
sea game you want to do some fancy plays
and run some high various lines what are

[2:01:00]
and run some high various lines what are
some of the kind of maybe thought
patterns you use or specific things you
do too or remind yourself not to uh to
take on these high variance approaches
um
well the thing is if you're playing good
players there are still spots where
you're going to have to do something

[2:01:15]
you're going to have to do something
High variants but what I S like
I I just start removing deviations
because
I can't be confident that the reason I'm
deviating
uh is a good one rather than an
emotional one for instance uh when I was

[2:01:32]
emotional one for instance uh when I was
playing Doug
at the end of day one
there was um
there was a spot where like okay there
were two spots one where I was thinking
about running a bluff

[2:01:45]
about running a bluff
and one where I was thinking about
um hero calling
and both of them I knew my hand wasn't
supposed to blub I wasn't supposed to
hear it but like I knew it was like
really really close like these hands
were
um but like I knew I knew they weren't
supposed to take this line uh and I was

[2:02:00]
supposed to take this line uh and I was
like I was a bit tired I was like a
little bit winners tilted actually where
you know I I just uh and I couldn't
really be sure if I just wanted to take
on more variants because it had been
going
so well for me all of these like high

[2:02:15]
so well for me all of these like high
variant spots they'd all gone my way so
far uh and so like because I couldn't
make that distinction I was just like
okay we're just gonna settle on the
theory the theory approach here like I
know
um so like I was tank I was tanking for
ages just you know because it's live you
don't you know you don't have a time

[2:02:30]
don't you know you don't have a time
bank at least in that setting so I I
have plenty of time to work it out I was
just like I couldn't be confident that
this was an emotional decision like very
rational once I was like okay we're just
gonna sat along like what I know is
purely rational because I I know I know
what the solver response is here so I

[2:02:45]
what the solver response is here so I
don't need to get online unfortunately
in both cases I was wrong like it was a
bluff which if I if I had run it I would
have got it through and like uh it was a
spot where I had a chance to hear a call
where he was bluffing
um so yeah kind of a shame but I also
like I was also kind of proud of myself

[2:03:01]
like I was also kind of proud of myself
of how the thought process worked that
it was like you know in our high stress
High motion environment like I sort of
had the instincts going on but I also
had like the werewolf all to to you know
rein them in and still play still play
in a way which I was like confident in

[2:03:16]
in a way which I was like confident in
um yeah I think it goes back to what you
were talking about earlier from a
strategic point of view isolating
important factors and when you're
emotionally compromised that's an
important factor that plays into your
reads plays into your ability to uh
almost play this exploitative intuitive

[2:03:30]
almost play this exploitative intuitive
game so if you can spot that it's almost
like you've created like a bit of safety
rails right in this moment my common
cells have dropped I can't be sure my
reads accurate after emotional I'm gonna
play it safe and rely on a theory based
model I thought I'd rather mentioned
this like um GTO Theory generally gives
you a safety net that kind of catches

[2:03:45]
you a safety net that kind of catches
you with your big game on your way down
you see game which I really like the
analogy of so yeah for you in those
moments even though you're a very
intuitive player you can rely on other
kind of solid foundation in those
moments knowing that you're potentially
missing important factors or you're in a
compromise state which I think is very

[2:04:00]
compromise state which I think is very
practical obviously hard to do in
practice because obviously when motions
get heightened and high stress so it's
good that you've been able to uh yeah
use that in the tables rather than just
a conceptual model you mentioned which I
thought was really interesting I'm
curious to know more about that building
mathematical proofs has really helped

[2:04:15]
mathematical proofs has really helped
you to make up abstract decisions at the
poker tables or understands abstract
decision making can you explain to
myself and the listeners what
mathematical proofs are and how they
help with the pocket decision making
process so so like
um like I studied a bit formal logic as

[2:04:32]
um like I studied a bit formal logic as
part of Like My Philosophy degree and
like
I also did a math degree which I dropped
out of beforehand
um but like when you when you have to
write proofs or do like
um like formal logic it's

[2:04:45]
um
like you're still you're distilling
things down to like if then statements
uh and then you know listing listing
like strict exceptions
um
rather that um

[2:05:00]
rather that um
yeah and so and so it like allows you to
allows you to build like design a
thought process
um more so than like having a having a
jumble of things you can
you can say like okay
this is the first factor I want to

[2:05:15]
this is the first factor I want to
consider
if it leans this way then I you know
then I go down this list of exceptions
um and and yeah it's kind of uh it makes
for like a nice ordered thought process
rather than like having things uh having

[2:05:30]
rather than like having things uh having
things chaotically
um
I think as well you can um yeah I mean
it comes back to like all the like mixes
are just options in the game tree and
it's like
um I use the term free roll a lot when
I'm talking to people for things which
really aren't free is like running a

[2:05:46]
really aren't free is like running a
huge Bluff
um but like sometimes sometimes if you
have like so say there's like five
factors in favor
or like five factors against I mean this
can go the opposite way you know it
doesn't always have to be running the
bluff I swear sometimes I give up but

[2:06:02]
bluff I swear sometimes I give up but
like but like you have like five factors
in favor five factors against and then
you're like well
like I know that all the factors in
favor of running this Bluff hold
and then like four of them against and

[2:06:16]
and then like four of them against and
it's like and it's like you've got this
last one where it's like where it's like
okay like maybe this is true maybe this
isn't and it's like oh if it's true well
you know I just like I didn't lose any
EV it's still a zero EV play
um and then but it's like so so you're

[2:06:30]
um and then but it's like so so you're
like you have this sort of average of
you know this average play you're
playing against like half the time half
the time it's a zero the decision and
then half the time it makes a few big
blinds
um and so then you don't have to
you don't have to make this like really

[2:06:45]
you don't have to make this like really
strict um
you don't have to make this like really
strict uh like model of like exactly
what someone knows as well which helps
with the uncertainty in poker because I
think a lot of the time when I um
well I talked to uh like mistakes

[2:07:00]
well I talked to uh like mistakes
players and they're always concerned by
exactly what their opponents are doing
uh and it's like well you can still use
these like you can use these like
weightings and like probably like
probability models of like not just you
know within the setting of Poker but you

[2:07:16]
know within the setting of Poker but you
can like assign probabilities to what
people know uh and like that has
um you know that that has an impact on
eBay you know you can fine-tune these
especially in a heads-up environment
people will give you like lots more
information about what they do and don't
know very very quickly

[2:07:32]
know very very quickly
um and I think like lots of people like
you know get a bit lost in the search
for search for certainty and forget that
you can like you can model something
somewhere between zero and a hundred
percent and it still has like a tangible
effect on EV

[2:07:45]
effect on EV
um and yeah if you say like this action
is like equal or greater than EV to the
other one well that's like well like
obviously we should be taking it like
even if it's equal like who cares
um
yeah I think that's something people can
get the lost in like they only want to
deviate for like certain game rather

[2:08:01]
deviate for like certain game rather
than if you take like a load of small
deviations which have like just like you
know some potential game but then you
add up those like probabilities together
and like suddenly like enough of them
went right that um enough of these free
roles uh went right that you've uh

[2:08:16]
roles uh went right that you've uh
you've got the win rate
um so I've got this correctly the kind
of building mathematical proofs is
almost like Korean Air hypothesis of a
kind of strategy or something to do and
then you stress test that in different
scenarios and see if it kind of holds
true with different kind of

[2:08:30]
true with different kind of
circumstances and if there's a trend
towards if more of this then you do it
more frequently and it doesn't need
Perfection it's more like a waiting
system where if you stress tested enough
it would create
um some sort of certainty at least some
sort of confidence is that roughly how
it equates yeah and also you can I mean

[2:08:47]
it equates yeah and also you can I mean
like like you you can do this stuff uh
like you know it comes back to like
prodding people with these with these
lines like you can um
like sometimes you can take like you can

[2:09:00]
like sometimes you can take like you can
go into the you can go into these spots
just with like the the idea of
information gathering as well it's like
okay well I don't know if this line is
good well I'm gonna need to run it I'm
gonna need to run it and see how it goes
maybe not even you know maybe you need
to read on how the population plays it

[2:09:15]
to read on how the population plays it
maybe you want to know exactly how this
person plays it like you don't need to
um
like you you can sort of like like the
yeah the information has value as well
so how would a player use this to build
a strategy let's say they're trying to
prod the opposition to see if they know

[2:09:32]
prod the opposition to see if they know
the counter strategy to what they're
doing how can they start to uh from
almost like first principles think about
how to uh build their strategy or I
think through an example is anything
that comes to mind in terms of you know
for example we could use to run through
this this Frame of thinking uh well one

[2:09:46]
this this Frame of thinking uh well one
thing you need to know is like um
like information
uh like information rich showdowns
um
like they're sometimes you know someone
said that's gonna give nothing away

[2:10:02]
said that's gonna give nothing away
um sometimes like a lot of times
showdowns will give something away about
how someone thinks about poker and then
you know if you if you know if you know
what showdowns are relevant

[2:10:15]
what showdowns are relevant
um like which one which ones you need to
look out for
uh and then you can also like
extrapolate that to other things like if
you have a good idea of like okay this
isn't supposed to happen
what is like the key reason why it
doesn't happen

[2:10:30]
doesn't happen
uh and then it's like okay so they
there's like a higher probability that
they don't know that they don't have
this piece of knowledge
uh and then you can start
cross-referencing that um are there like
other spots in the game tree where

[2:10:45]
other spots in the game tree where
you're seeing a similar mistake
uh and then you can build up this
confidence that this is going to be a
consistent mistake that they're often
going to they're often gonna make
I like that it's almost like run
experiments I was picturing Japanese
example when he mentioned like if they
didn't three bet pre-flop he thought you

[2:11:01]
didn't three bet pre-flop he thought you
would raise re-engine position and the
counter attack was kind of the the
unfortunately I had to donk the Flop
high range so Renny could run that
experiment and go okay do they combat
this with a high dunk on the turn okay
they don't there's a good chance they
don't know this kind of airport the game

[2:11:15]
don't know this kind of airport the game
trade but I think it goes to uh it links
a lot of the ideas you're saying earlier
about the chess Court of taking people
into the woods and like being the only
one out like taking the game trigging
areas and seeing it do people know the
adaptation here and run those
experiments like that you said which
have a high certainty if they don't take

[2:11:30]
have a high certainty if they don't take
this action there's a good chances of
Gap in their knowledge there I get lots
of information for this small little
experiment that I'm playing things very
interesting could lead to a lot of
thought process for players watching
this so yeah I think it's very
interesting Avenue I want to change the
conversation a little bit towards life
design and you mentioned how it's

[2:11:46]
design and you mentioned how it's
important to design your lifestyle in
alignment with your goals and your
values and then trending towards a place
of Happiness there's been the
questionnaire you did for us so in terms
of how you go about the process how do
you prioritize your goals and align them

[2:12:00]
you prioritize your goals and align them
with your values one of the things
you've done to uh to get some clarity on
this
and uh I take a bunch of psychedelics
think about life
and
uh I mean I mean like yeah that was one

[2:12:16]
uh I mean I mean like yeah that was one
time where I was in uni and I
first time taking antipsychedelics and I
was thinking about like
okay so what are the sort of abstract
things that are important to me
um I was like wow

[2:12:30]
um I was like wow
you know like there's obviously like
so so I basically like boiled it down to
like you know uh time with my friends
and family
uh and then like aesthetic Pleasures
like music and fashion and then
competing

[2:12:45]
competing
uh and so those were like the three sort
of main things where I was just like if
you know if I got to do all those or
like not necessarily competing with with
other people but it's all like competing
with myself like there there's like a
um
there's a Socrates quote where it's

[2:13:00]
there's a Socrates quote where it's
saying like uh it's a oh I'm gonna
completely butcher it but like it it's
about like
um it's a shame for a man not to have
seen his body at his Peak and like he's
talking about like I think I mean
allegedly talking about athleticism
which is why all the statues of him he's

[2:13:15]
which is why all the statues of him he's
like ripped and hazmatic abs but um but
like you know I think as well like you
know in terms of like it's a shame not
to see you know not to see your
potential uh and so like yeah I look uh
I looked across like those three things
I was like these are the three areas of
my life

[2:13:30]
my life
that I like need to satisfy in order to
be yeah in order to be happy like if any
if any of these fall short then I'm
gonna you know in in some way feel uh in
some way feel a bit lost and like you
know it's not like I'm doing it always
perfectly but whenever I'm whenever I'm

[2:13:47]
perfectly but whenever I'm whenever I'm
feeling a bit I'm satisfied with things
it usually comes back to like you know
there's one aspect of that that I'm like
you know that I'm not that I'm not
catering to it in some way and so like
yeah yeah I think it's so important to

[2:14:01]
yeah yeah I think it's so important to
uh align our lives with the things that
we value most and most of us have three
to five real cold buckets of values we
could subdivide those if we wanted to
remember to start this conversation you
you mentioned the poke episode was a
little bit around almost fulfilling your
potential that you did in the chess

[2:14:15]
potential that you did in the chess
which goes in this kind of competition
area and that's one of those things that
where if we ignore these like real
intrinsic drives of what we want to do
and what motivates us to take action you
mentioned how you're always motivated to
play poker if we ignore things that are
really important like well it takes like

[2:14:30]
really important like well it takes like
your Delux to figure this out or you sit
and contemplate or you do reflecting on
the things you value most when you
understand which of the things matter to
me most and how do I create a life on
average in alignment with those things I
think it creates a much more like I said
trending towards happiness great
terminology and that's what we want to

[2:14:45]
terminology and that's what we want to
be returning towards happiness so for
you what are some of the things you need
to be doing on a regular basis or how do
you create alignment with those values
what are the things that I'm putting to
you on a daily weekly yearly
I think honestly right like right now it

[2:15:00]
I think honestly right like right now it
feels pretty blessed because I have like
uh I have like a lot of free time to go
see my friends
and like you know I don't really have
many expenses because I'm like a young
guy I don't really have any dependence
or anything so like you know if I want
some clothes or like whatever if I wanna

[2:15:16]
some clothes or like whatever if I wanna
you know if I wanted to spend a day
chilling like listening to like music or
watching films like I can so I feel like
I'm I feel like I'm kind of living my
dream right now to be honest like I feel
I feel like I don't have to you know I
don't have to work too hard like in the

[2:15:30]
don't have to work too hard like in the
past I've had times where I've got like
I got like two lost in the
competitiveness side of things and then
like I think like the burnout comes from
when like the competitiveness is
unfulfilled but like I'm also like you
know so driven to correct that side that

[2:15:47]
know so driven to correct that side that
like the rest of my life starts like you
know slipping like I you know I
neglecting friends and like on I I like
wasn't doing things like other than
poker and then like when that balance
starts to slip it's like
yeah I mean I mean yeah it's obviously

[2:16:00]
yeah I mean I mean yeah it's obviously
difficult but I think I think it's like
right now it sort of feels like as long
as I'm yeah as long as I take away from
the things other than poker like poker
just takes care of itself
um like I like yeah I just make sure
like yeah make sure I'm like relaxing
and staying away from the table and then

[2:16:15]
and staying away from the table and then
it's like effortless to get back to it
for me to be honest
um yeah I like that when you said when
you take care of the things away from
tables the poker things take care of
themselves and I'm trying to think of a
way to relate to some players who maybe
struggle with this because I've had
conversations especially young players
who are ambitious and let's say for you

[2:16:30]
who are ambitious and let's say for you
you've got obviously a lot of success
and you're happy with where you're
pocket wise but that's if you didn't
let's say you had a chip on your
shoulder and you haven't quite hit that
Competitive Edge for yourself you
haven't quite ticked the box of I've
achieved something and you know there's
kind of other factors that are like
relationships balancing your lifestyle

[2:16:45]
relationships balancing your lifestyle
that matter but the the competition and
the need to get some validation through
what you're doing becomes very strong
and how how would you if that was you or
you've experienced this how do you think
you can go about trying to see the kind
of clearer lens that as you said like

[2:17:00]
of clearer lens that as you said like
taking care of the other things will
help with the portable suit how do you
any advice about guys who may be
struggling with getting that balance and
I might be too drawn towards the
competition or achievement
one thing that was really helpful for me
was sort of changing
uh like the success that I was striving

[2:17:17]
uh like the success that I was striving
for
um on a day-to-day basis
because I think uh saying which I felt a
lot of pressure about was like you know
I like I like I want to be like the

[2:17:30]
I like I like I want to be like the
number one guy and so then it feels like
you know that can be like an eternally
unfulfilling thing right like only one
guy gets to be the number one guy like
there's no guarantee you make it like I
mean I feel like I feel like I'm on like
a good trajectory but like you know I I
don't know if I'm gonna make it there or
not so um and also you obviously you

[2:17:46]
not so um and also you obviously you
can't do it a day
um
so the way uh the way I started thinking
about instead was like my goal for like
the competitive side of things was I
wanted to
like play like the best possible version

[2:18:00]
like play like the best possible version
of myself
for like some amount of time and like I
I wasn't trying to like
like I was basically like ended up
cutting off that time at the end of
sessions where like you're like really
pushing yourself to burn out where like
you're playing when you're like too

[2:18:15]
you're playing when you're like too
tired and you're like not on a high win
rate
um so like it's not even it's not even
making that much in terms of hourly
uh and I was yeah I started thinking
about that and I was like well this is
this time is unsatisfying to me
it goes wrong more often

[2:18:31]
it goes wrong more often
um and it's interfering with my ability
to you know to live the rest of my life
the way I wanted to
um so then
like for a while like I cut it down like
really extremely I was just like my goal
is to play like like maximum three hours

[2:18:46]
is to play like like maximum three hours
but to just play like three hours where
like I executed as well as I possibly
could for three hours on a date and then
I was like banned from playing for the
rest of the day
um that didn't really work for very long
because when I started doing that I was
like oh I'm playing like so well in this

[2:19:00]
like oh I'm playing like so well in this
time that it's like so satisfying like I
don't feel like exhausted at all and so
now like I usually like you know I have
like five hours where like I'm like
trying to you know compete as like hard
as I can and then like you know there's
like some like maybe like one to three

[2:19:16]
like some like maybe like one to three
hours of studying and then like that
that's like an eight hour work day and
then like the rest of the time like you
know very relaxed like do whatever it
takes my fancy like hang out with
friends like
um but yeah it's more it's more about
just like just playing like these short

[2:19:30]
just like just playing like these short
like really like you know really
rewarding amounts of time rather than
just like grinding until we reach the
goal
um like yeah yeah just recognizing that
the goal will happen like piece by piece
uh rather than in one big swoop which
yeah you're not even making progress

[2:19:46]
yeah you're not even making progress
here you know yeah it's saying like
those last two hours it's like you're
not learning anything like
you know I'm not trying to train my
autopilot I'm not trying to become like
a massive multitabler I'm trying to like
I'm trying to increase like the ceiling
at which I play
um so so yeah it was just uh it was just

[2:20:01]
um so so yeah it was just uh it was just
pointless anyway so I decided to just
get rid of it yeah I think the bigger
your goal and the more kind of long term
the goal the more you need to break it
down or reframe it into small wins and
get a process driven actions so if you
think of your goal to be the best player

[2:20:15]
think of your goal to be the best player
in the world like that's a long path to
misery if you hold yourself to standard
I only win if that is true like
everything else is a feel on the way to
that standard you can see very quickly
how that's going to lead to a very
unfulfilling pursuit of that goal
however if you can break it down into

[2:20:30]
however if you can break it down into
winnable days winnable moments action
steps you can take on a regular basis to
get you to that goal I think especially
for big goals it becomes much more
important I think there's there's
definitely space for having deadlines
towards smaller goals especially ones
that you have more control over
especially it's like a huge goal that

[2:20:45]
especially it's like a huge goal that
you're aiming towards like becoming the
best version of yourself I do think like
they're breaking it down into winnable
days and winnable things to do makes a
lot of sense in terms of tracking like
in terms of how you uh know your winning
I think it's really interesting that
often success is this kind of loose term
let's be successful but it means

[2:21:00]
let's be successful but it means
different things to different people but
yourself what are the main things you
need to do right now well at the moment
on a regular basis let's say daily or
weekly to win your days I think we need
to almost all set up and take a
scorecard for ourselves that we decide
these things matter the most I will do
these things regularly if I do I'm one

[2:21:16]
these things regularly if I do I'm one
of my days one of my weeks anything that
you've got on your your list that's
important for you
well I mean like you know from a
professional perspective as long as I'm
a better player at the end of the week
than I started it it was a good week
how do you quantify that

[2:21:30]
how do you quantify that
um
yeah just uh like like well it can
either come from adding like it's a very
or just like or just working on my
execution like it doesn't even have to
be huge progress like as long as you're

[2:21:45]
be huge progress like as long as you're
like you know inching it forward
um and I have so much stuff to study you
know like I'm trying to play two
different formats right now
um like yeah it's really easy for me to
find new stuff that like uh that like
either I haven't worked on in a while or

[2:22:01]
either I haven't worked on in a while or
like you know I mean the heads Up game
tree is small But like everyone who
plays heads up knows it really well
because because it's small so like
there's like lots of room for the
announces and then like the six Max game
free by comparison is vast so like
there's always there's always new stuff

[2:22:16]
there's always there's always new stuff
that I can be working on
um like you know even just like
emotional things
um
like making sure my execution doesn't
slip
um but yeah I was playing someone uh
heads up yesterday when when the game

[2:22:30]
heads up yesterday when when the game
broke and I'd been like I've been tilted
because like I think like the fish had
stacked me and then like donated it to
someone else I was just watching the
money go and I was like frustrated
um it's like a pretty yeah I'm pretty
sure it's like a pretty good player who
I was playing but like I I think I got

[2:22:46]
I was playing but like I I think I got
back to a game within like really quick
time for me like usually it can be like
a bit of a struggle but like I think I
got back to it in like two minutes I
felt like So Satisfied I was playing and
so that was like you know obviously
that's not something which you work on
in the lab it's saying which you have to

[2:23:01]
in the lab it's saying which you have to
train at the table when you're having
those moments that you're struggling but
like yeah that's the kind of thing which
gives me like immense satisfaction
um and then yeah just try trying to
trying to stay away from using the
results to judge like um like I had like
a [ __ ] there yesterday but I was also

[2:23:16]
a [ __ ] there yesterday but I was also
like you know immediately when you have
a [ __ ] day it's very uh
like uh very motivating to go reviewer
and then I went and reviewed it and I
was like okay like there were definitely
uh they're definitely some hands there
where I'm like
a bit uh like they're kind of debatable

[2:23:30]
a bit uh like they're kind of debatable
but like even if it was a mistake like
I'm not like you know I think I think
these things are like really close in
there and then as long as I'm as long as
I'm satisfied with my execution it's uh
it's good and then I I mean just like
from a personal point of view I mean
like just making sure that making sure

[2:23:46]
like just making sure that making sure
that I'm not letting friendships dwindle
I feel like I'm more of a like quality
over quantity guy you know like there
are people who
you know people who are are like have
like a really good time with and have
like a really good bond with and just
making sure that like you I don't let

[2:24:01]
making sure that like you I don't let
these things Decay by getting too too um
distracted all the other stuff
um
yeah yeah that's all uh as long as I as
long as I keep those things in order
yeah the other things just uh sort of
happen you know uh sticking a film on

[2:24:16]
happen you know uh sticking a film on
isn't saying I really need to think
about or like you know that's uh not the
that side of things like is uh
yeah that sort of thing and like
listening to music I mean is like
it's like I feel like it's a Simple

[2:24:30]
it's like I feel like it's a Simple
Pleasures you know it's not like I have
uh I have something incredibly complex
that I need to do to it to enjoy my time
off so
yeah I think for you the main thing is
like trending towards like progression
making growth making improvements
overall to get to your bigger goal and

[2:24:46]
overall to get to your bigger goal and
as long as you're feeling that there's
things you're working on you're
improving you're seeing your execution
getting better you're patient you're on
the process and you're going that
direction I think like you said players
a lot of people struggle with using
results as the kind of metric to judge
am I moving forwards if they have a
great winning week they're like yes I'm

[2:25:00]
great winning week they're like yes I'm
doing great they have a bad month or so
and all of a sudden they feel like
they're moving forwards see I think
create your own score kind of what
things actually matter like the
emotional example was a great one to uh
return from until it's date back to high
performance quickly good sign that
you're you're improving your time spent
in your ear game which is a big factor

[2:25:15]
in your ear game which is a big factor
towards your success so in terms of it's
easy to say results don't matter because
I'm running well you know what I mean
like if I'd had a worse year maybe uh
you know like they've become more in the
Forefront but yeah so it's like I feel
like it's you know

[2:25:30]
like it's you know
don't take advice from people who are uh
who are like living a bit too lucky
right now yeah very true I think the
best time to work on your relationship
results is your downswings you're in
tough times I think a lot of players
during like people patches their career
when everything's going well they're

[2:25:45]
when everything's going well they're
like oh yeah no more till issues yes all
my emotions are gone
the links are gone and then they're
going down between like wait a minute
what's where all these coming from
it's like you know I like yeah I lost
six pounds yesterday but it's like you
know

[2:26:00]
know
it's like wow I I was sitting there like
oh I haven't lost six pounds in a day in
a while like we would do you know it's
easy to brush it off if you lose six
pounds for a fifth day in a row like
okay okay like now it's like
very different now
very different place to be

[2:26:16]
very different place to be
yeah what would you say is the most
important lesson that poker has taught
you that you didn't expect coming in
um
for say like not to be like fickle

[2:26:30]
for say like not to be like fickle
uh uh yeah like it kind of like results
oriented I guess but like
I mean it's just uh
it's like listening to listening to my
friends talk about sport
uh and it's like
I'm just like I'm just keenly aware of

[2:26:45]
I'm just like I'm just keenly aware of
how much variance has gone into you know
the things that they're basing their
opinion on someone
um and uh and I feel like it's you know
cutting through that is obviously like
it's obviously really hard because it's

[2:27:00]
it's obviously really hard because it's
like
you know I I I've had like millions of
hands at this point to do it
um and just being like and like and like
even then it's like
it's like your brain wants to see
patterns in things which are sometimes
just random

[2:27:16]
just random
um but I think like having that practice
is so good I think it's like kind of a
stereotypical answer but I I like for a
reason I would say
um because like yeah very few people in
like go through that sort of like
uh go through that experience I remember
seeing

[2:27:31]
seeing
somewhere as like um
you know if if you look at like
if you look at like when people apply to
jobs with like a small applicant pool uh
and then you just add like a small like
luck element
and then it's like you add like a small

[2:27:46]
and then it's like you add like a small
luck element and then like almost
universally everyone anyone who gets the
job is like in the top percentile for
luck uh it's like even even if there's
like you know there's hundreds of
applicants and like yeah it's like
they're gonna be like some of the high
Achievers but it's like you can't you

[2:28:00]
Achievers but it's like you can't you
can't get it without the luck and then
like not taking these sort of things
you know like unders understanding that
like sometimes in life like sometimes
you like like you haven't [ __ ] up
um you know like yeah just uh yeah it
does it doesn't mean like absolving

[2:28:15]
does it doesn't mean like absolving
yourself of all personal accountability
but yeah I guess that's like a nice sort
of Flip Side to it um
so you know there it teaches you a
waiting of um
like okay like you know actually
assessing what do I need to take
personal accountability for and what was

[2:28:32]
personal accountability for and what was
beyond my control
um so that you can so that you can be
more more objective about things because
like obviously you're practicing it in
like a very theoretical like this sort
of like you know abstract maths heavy
environment but just having that
attitude of being like okay it's fine

[2:28:45]
attitude of being like okay it's fine
for some things to be beyond my control
but those things which are in my control
even if they're like limited like I like
it's up to me to go out and control them
very good historic principles there like
controllable variables and splitting
life into uh what you control yeah I do

[2:29:01]
life into uh what you control yeah I do
feel like most people who on experience
with a game like poker are dealing with
probabilities don't understand how
extreme probabilities look and all
scenarios and like you said like
watching people debate things that have
got high variance a high degree of luck
involved and thinking they're experts in
that degree and that kind of field or

[2:29:16]
that degree and that kind of field or
that they've got some information when
generates a really small sample size so
much variance and yeah you've got very
little kind of skills I realize I'm
efficient almost every debate I'm in
really because I've got no data points
and there's so much varies in it but at
the same time also uh not being like

[2:29:30]
the same time also uh not being like
defeatist from that and also coming back
wait a second I do control certain nodes
I do control certain inputs I do control
certain parts of it how can I pay more
attention to those things what's
understanding there's a lot of things I
would say my control it's like being a
poker player and trying to reach high
stakes there's so many things that you

[2:29:45]
stakes there's so many things that you
can do to help your career to move
forward to learn but then you go to play
high stakes poker and you're playing so
much variance in the short term that you
can't control that part of it so I think
it's a Empower mindset to remind
yourself of those uh kind of
controllable variables
and like when you know when so much of

[2:30:02]
and like when you know when so much of
what you do is defined by luck you know
like within any one day like your
results have basically nothing to do
with your skill like whether you're up
or down
um it gives you
more of an appreciation for what you can

[2:30:15]
more of an appreciation for what you can
control
um like you know even if even if what
you can control is small like you have
this evidence that it adds up
uh like you're you're like shown this
all the time whenever you zoom out on
the graphing you stop thinking about
like the past week and you start looking

[2:30:30]
like the past week and you start looking
at the past year
um so then yeah seeing that like in life
even if there are things beyond your
control it's like okay well like like
what part of this situation
like what part of the situation is up to
me and then I'll focus on that and I'll
I'll like make yeah I'll make the best

[2:30:46]
I'll like make yeah I'll make the best
of it even if it's even if it's
ultimately gonna
fall on something which I can't I can't
handle
yeah it's almost like look like that
fortune favors the brave sort of thing
like look will find you when you're
doing the right things often enough I
remember Tim Ferriss who's got one of

[2:31:00]
remember Tim Ferriss who's got one of
the most popular podcasts and it's at
one point his podcast was probably more
popular than the Joe Rogan's and
someone's asking how do you get such a
successful podcast and his response was
I got lucky I was the right place at the
right time and then he kind of double
down going I was doing some really good
podcasts for a long time I'm really good

[2:31:15]
podcasts for a long time I'm really good
guess but I got lucky that things
unfolded that I got a lot of traction at
the right time I did my part but then
the reason I'm as big as I am is because
of all the fact is as well so I think
it's it's always good to uh know when
you're what what your input what impact
sorry I'm not getting confirmation bias
when you're hearing him success if you

[2:31:30]
when you're hearing him success if you
look at if we interviewed every high
stakes player right now I'm sure there's
a element of look that went into a lot
of their Journeys but the same time
there's a lot of things they did right a
lot of kind of success habits that would
be whole truth amongst them all to kind
of understand the interplay and yeah
when you work in a occupation that
relies on a lot of areas or has a lot of

[2:31:46]
relies on a lot of areas or has a lot of
variance you've got to be very
realistic with what's what you control
what you're doing yeah yeah that was um
that was actually something which
weirdly attracted me to Poker
because I remember feeling like
a bit lost in a sense of like I really
didn't want to go into an office job

[2:32:01]
didn't want to go into an office job
but I wasn't sure where exactly I wanted
to go
uh and I did I like I had other
interests as well I was thinking of
pursuing like I like I enjoyed the idea
of like writing whether it was like
poetry or screen or screenwriting like
screenplays maybe scripts but but anyway

[2:32:15]
screenplays maybe scripts but but anyway
yeah I I hadn't really nailed it down I
just enjoyed doing drama in school and
like creative writing as well
um
but like one thing which really scared
me was like I felt like the luck element
in those fields was so so high

[2:32:31]
in those fields was so so high
uh because I was like you could have
this amazing idea
and like you could just like like oh
just as you're about to show it to
people someone else basically does the
same thing and it's like oh well no
one's looking for this script anymore or
like and then you have to like start

[2:32:45]
like and then you have to like start
again or like you show it to like the
wrong people who aren't a fan like maybe
they get the right feel thing but then
like they never put it in production or
something like that like I hear about
like all these things
um
and and it's just like and that idea

[2:33:00]
and and it's just like and that idea
that like you could do everything right
or like
um like plenty of plenty of writers
are like you know only appreciated like
after they die and like I was just like
you know okay okay like you're supposed
to do something for the love of the art
but it's also just like I would kind of

[2:33:15]
but it's also just like I would kind of
like to I would kind of like to enjoy
some of that success myself
um and so like that idea was like
um kind of scary to me and then like
saying like poker I was just like okay
like there is this there is this intense
element of luck when you like you know
zoom in but when you zoom out I feel

[2:33:30]
zoom in but when you zoom out I feel
like it's saying where like if you put
the work in
um if you put the work in and you're
like motivated uh you're like most
likely to reap to reap the rewards like
real life can like rear its ugly head
and like I know that happens

[2:33:46]
and like I know that happens
um
like I remember like Yuri telling me
that like when most people quit poker
it's
only kind of about the poker like they
have a downswing which coincides with
something going really wrong in their
life and then like the downswing is just
like too much to handle that's too much

[2:34:01]
like too much to handle that's too much
emotional stress so they do something
more stable but like you know like it's
say like if you're if you're just about
like if you manage to like go free uh be
free from that it's like you you can
only get so unlucky for so long you know
like like yeah you'd laugh at like

[2:34:17]
like like yeah you'd laugh at like
people with if they're playing Five and
L and saying ah the reason I can't play
high stakes is because my Aces always
get cracked right like it's you know
it's a ridiculous thing to say um it's
clearly about like your knowledge and
understanding of the game and that will
always win out in the long run
um which yeah I think I think was like

[2:34:31]
um which yeah I think I think was like
really motivating for me to to go into
this sort of like almost like objective
test right like I didn't have to you
know it's not opinion based you're
either like you're either good or you're
not yeah I heard Alexa Mosey say a
volume beats look in almost everything

[2:34:45]
volume beats look in almost everything
and if you think about any Pursuit
you're on volume putting in reps being
consistent for long enough almost always
overrides look in yeah it's interesting
thinking about other Pursuits that are
different in poker because some people
think poker's super high variance lots
of luck involved but I think in other
Pursuits like you mentioned being an

[2:35:00]
Pursuits like you mentioned being an
author or going some creative it's
unquantifiable the variance is
completely unquantifiable there's so
many factors that you can't think of
whereas poker it's all on the table the
feedback loops there the quantifiable
amounts of variants there's calculations
that calculate variants you can see your
EV in spots you can look at solvers you
can pretty much quantify how much

[2:35:16]
can pretty much quantify how much
variance plays a role in descent degrees
and then you get a feedback loop to
improve and get better as well so I
think it creates a dynamic where the
rules of the game are obvious the
factors in player are obvious my skill
is going to be the biggest driver
variance I've got to negate in the short
term all right let's play Let's have it

[2:35:30]
term all right let's play Let's have it
figured out so yeah creates a nice
progression to uh to move forward how
about for yourself for any What
attracted you originally to Poker and
what keeps you interested
nothing

[2:35:45]
What attracted me initially to Poker I
mean I kind of rolled into it but mainly
I started to get more intrigued in poker
when I started to learn a bit more about
strategy put that strategy into play and
actually saw like hey wait if I do this
you do that oh cool so I sort of have

[2:36:02]
you do that oh cool so I sort of have
like this sense of control over what's
actually going on at the table and then
maybe like the Strategic aspect that
came with it like I'm definitely in it
for for the game itself for sure and how

[2:36:15]
for for the game itself for sure and how
do I continue to stay motivated or
continue to have interest it's basically
I need I need input I need novelty if I
remove that then it becomes uh very
difficult like if if poker starts to

[2:36:30]
difficult like if if poker starts to
feel like a grind and I'm just executing
I mean there's a reason why I for
example also do other things right
coaching we do this podcast I'm always
trying to
growth we talked about those growth is
definitely one of my values and also one
of the reasons why I transitioned away

[2:36:46]
of the reasons why I transitioned away
from playing full time and transitioned
to coaching and I've tried try twitch
and we're doing this podcast because I
feel like if you put yourself in
different environments that's when you
start growing and also that's when other
opportunities will rise that allow you

[2:37:00]
opportunities will rise that allow you
to go even further and I remember at
some point I was like just dating they
are going to my office and grinding I
was like
I don't know it feels like obviously
you're growing as a player but it felt
like a very one-dimensional growth and I
felt like if I would step out and try
other things I didn't know what would

[2:37:16]
other things I didn't know what would
come on my path right I didn't know we
would have this podcast for example but
if I just kept on going to my office
every day and grind this would have
probably not happened and probably a
couple years from now there will be
other things that will have happened
that would not have happened if I kept

[2:37:32]
that would not have happened if I kept
on just grinding so yeah it's a it's a
it's a little bit of both some of my
satisfaction I can get in in poker but
many of them actually outside of Boca
Richardson was actually one of the
reasons why I transitioned a bit more

[2:37:45]
reasons why I transitioned a bit more
away from uh from granny full time but
yeah it was really interesting listening
to the conversation that you guys had
definitely I think we had someone on
that pointed this out as well I don't
recall exactly the guess what they also
said actually in poker there's not so
much variance if you compare it to and I
think he compared it to sports like take

[2:38:00]
think he compared it to sports like take
for example football the World Cup only
comes once every four years and then you
have to be very [ __ ] lucky to get to
the final and then everything has to
fall right for you to win I mean winning
the World Cup it's quite hard there's a
lot of variants involved and the biggest

[2:38:15]
lot of variants involved and the biggest
problem is yeah you only get to try once
every four years at least with poker you
know we can go back tomorrow and grind
again I guess it's a bit different let's
say for example thinking the main event
would be a bit like World Cup Maybe yeah
I mean it's just like you know when I

[2:38:31]
I mean it's just like you know when I
mean one of those conversations about
sports would be like oh is Messi the
greatest of all time and it'd be like ah
but like you know he's won everything
but he hadn't won the World Cup and so
everyone's just like well yeah he had it
was unlucky he's like like I'm not you

[2:38:46]
was unlucky he's like like I'm not you
know you don't even have to say like
anything about like oh but like look at
his teams it's like let's say that Messi
was on like the best team every single
time he got to the World Cup he's still
like you know he still loses the vast
majority of those times like it's a

[2:39:00]
majority of those times like it's a
knockout tournament it's not it's not a
league if you look at the favorites
they're only favorites by what 30 35 or
something to win yeah yeah also you have
that periods and you have indeed the
variants let's say for example take
Holland right currently Manchester City

[2:39:15]
Holland right currently Manchester City
striker one of the arguably one of the
better players right now yeah he's a bit
unlucky that he was born in Norway so
winning the World Cup is going to be
very unlikely yeah yeah yeah
but if he does it would be uh be a very
nice forever in his cap though but yeah
I I just remember like yeah after Messi

[2:39:31]
I I just remember like yeah after Messi
wins the World Cup just like now he is
the greatest ever and I was just saying
it's like what the [ __ ] did like did
Linus become the greatest ever when he
like won that Triton 200k oh no he
didn't even win he came second yeah yeah
so now

[2:39:46]
so now
so yeah yeah yeah so Linus isn't the
great like I think Sam squid one uh I
can't remember yeah it's like it's like
when you're yeah when you're confronted
with that all the time it's uh it
becomes very uh so what what you guys
were talking about how you learn a lot

[2:40:01]
were talking about how you learn a lot
of skills in poker and then if you go to
real life you see all the biases that
people have you see that people don't
recognize a lot of variants especially
in in football I'm a I'm a soccer
football whoever which country is
watching we'll call it different I'm a

[2:40:15]
watching we'll call it different I'm a
big fan and then if you look at the post
match
whereas like I'm very good at estimating
like the variance that was involved in a
football game right it's automatically
you're like we played [ __ ] what we want
and then it's like and then they had to
come to say yeah you know this is also a
skill you know when you have not your

[2:40:30]
skill you know when you have not your
day but you can still pull out the win
I'm saying what the [ __ ] are you doing
to me trying to try to invent all these
things I'm like no you were just lucky
or you were just unlucky
do we have a problem what's wrong with
this team I'm like well we do we you
just got unlucky you were clearly the

[2:40:45]
just got unlucky you were clearly the
better team I think I think it is like
is there a job to build narrative though
yeah drama like do they actually believe
it maybe they do maybe that's why they
do such conviction but yeah yeah I just
can't I just can't imagine thinking that
stuff is like

[2:41:00]
stuff is like
you know thinking that stuff is actually
correct this is like I mean if you were
if you were worse and you and you win
it's like how
like like the skill would have been
playing better than the other team like
um like I hope at least behind closed

[2:41:15]
um like I hope at least behind closed
doors with the managers and the players
I hope the evaluation is done at a
higher level a more rational level
another thing actually I want to point
out in real life two very important
skills I think I think poker makes you
very humble in terms of realizing that

[2:41:31]
very humble in terms of realizing that
there's so much stuff that you don't
know
right because it's so complex and you
see indeed people have
very biased conversations over
short-term variants and they're very
strong opinion in the fact that they're
right and then sometimes I'm observing

[2:41:46]
right and then sometimes I'm observing
the conversation like wow this is flawed
on so many so many levels and also like
the and then they double down on the
fact that they think they're right based
on very little information and then if
the information is presented they are
still not able to admit that they were

[2:42:00]
still not able to admit that they were
wrong admitting that they're wrong or
that they're flawed or that they made a
mistake I think are all valuable skills
that you teach as well in being a poke
player that you don't see in real life
yeah I think the thing is as well like
if you
you know if you if you don't have the

[2:42:16]
you know if you if you don't have the
ability to admit when you're wrong
poker's going to give you so many
excuses
that it's just like it's just incredibly
unlikely that you'll succeed so it's
sort of like self-selecting in a sense
um
because it's like there's so many

[2:42:30]
because it's like there's so many
there's so many things that you can you
can blame it on but if you don't if you
don't have like the desire to actually
find an objective evaluation of what
you're doing like if you're content to
be deluded it'll let you
um yeah like I mean it's hence why like

[2:42:48]
um yeah like I mean it's hence why like
people can go on like losing for years
and like talk about how bad they run
um so yeah I think I think like there
might be like a bit of selection bias in
a sense where it's like did poker teach
people that or like are you only

[2:43:00]
people that or like are you only
successful about poker if you're only
successful with regard to Poker if you
were that way inclined
um but like I I mean it definitely does
reinforce it but yeah I think it's uh
but yeah why do some people stay Rex
despite like you know they're passionate
about the game not like the strategy

[2:43:15]
about the game not like the strategy
side but like they obviously clearly
really enjoy the game and they like
maybe talk some hands but like they
never really improve them because like
they're unwilling to
you know that I'm willing to take on new
information
another thing that that I wrote down
observing your story is I think a very

[2:43:31]
observing your story is I think a very
big difference you you you made it vocal
like you want to be number one
but and then Adam pointed out you have
to break that down because I was too
overwhelming but you should see me you
come across and you've designed your
life in a way like you come across as a

[2:43:46]
life in a way like you come across as a
very happy person it's not like you need
it's not like there's this big black
hole inside of you or inside of your
life that has to be fulfilled and can
only be fulfilled if you become the
number one poker player right and I feel
like that's usually where

[2:44:00]
like that's usually where
people start to struggle a lot if on a
day-to-day life you're not happy with
your life and you need to become number
one in order to fulfill that first of
all it actually becomes it actually
starts to work against you because you
every time go through life in a state of
lack which quantum physics wise you know
will not attract what you actually want

[2:44:17]
will not attract what you actually want
so that doesn't help and you stress out
then you're constantly hiding oh I'm so
unhappy and then basically yeah it
doesn't really happen so I feel like the
fact that you have constantly designed
your life and just everyday experience a
lot of Happiness helps you to just

[2:44:30]
lot of Happiness helps you to just
continue on this Pursuit because it
costs less energy it gives you I think a
lot of energy as well oh yeah I mean
like two things like one is I'd say like
it's easy to say this before I plateaued
out you know what I mean like I don't
know I don't know like if if I if I like
settle at some point and it's just like

[2:44:46]
settle at some point and it's just like
well being number one is off the cars
like maybe I'll find that distressing
um like whilst I'm still whilst I'm
still improving and like that's still
reasonably on the cards like you know
I'm not even saying it's necessarily
likely I could be like a big Underdog

[2:45:00]
likely I could be like a big Underdog
but it's like a possibility for me to
work towards
it is at least the attitude with which
you like to
live your poker career approach your
poker career correct yeah yeah that is
the most important thing if not number
one how high can I climb yeah exactly

[2:45:17]
one how high can I climb yeah exactly
and you will if you say I want to become
number hundred
it's unlikely that you become number 50
but if you say you want to become number
one it's very more likely that you
become number
and the other side of it is just uh I
have to thank my my friends are telling

[2:45:30]
have to thank my my friends are telling
me horror stories about what working in
an office is like this makes me feel
blessed every day you know or that you
have to deal with people like for
example my wife she's a dentist and she
deals with patients every day and then I
hear stories oh luckily I'd have to deal
with people every day yeah yeah I mean

[2:45:46]
with people every day yeah yeah I mean
it's like
like I get to you know like I'm I'm
working in a group like you know I do
like some coaching with people and it's
like but it's like it's very relaxing
because it's just like you know it's
just talking about what I'm passionate
about to people who are similarly
inclined like

[2:46:01]
inclined like
um you know we're all like we're all
like our goals are very aligned as well
like we're all like trying to get better
um constantly like it's very like open
environment
um so so yeah like like or none of that
stress is there in fact I say one of the

[2:46:17]
stress is there in fact I say one of the
really nice things about gorilla is um
like when I first came in I remember I
had like
I I had a few ideas which were like a
bit off the wall about like how I wanted
to play some spots uh and they were like

[2:46:32]
to play some spots uh and they were like
so open-minded about like not
necessarily just like taking it all
along like tearing up their game plan
instantly but like okay like how can we
Workshop this into something which
actually increases our age like and I
was like I'm like so nervous I was just
like coming in here and like you know

[2:46:45]
like coming in here and like you know
like like looked up duties graph on like
a smart hand or whatever and I was just
like oh the [ __ ] like you know it's just
like it's just like straight to the moon
like obviously you know I knew like
you're being like crushing for years and
like these other games and like you know

[2:47:00]
like these other games and like you know
Barack and all these guys but like they
were just like you know that there was
like like for guys who have like
achieved so much there was no there was
no hint of ego at all it was instantly
like there's anything like oh this seems
like you know this is really interesting

[2:47:15]
like you know this is really interesting
let's uh like let's see let's see what
we can let's see what we can make work
like even if we have to like you know it
wasn't like even if they have to abandon
it it was just like you know immediately
like giving the time of day of just
being like okay we're gonna we're gonna
like see what we can see what we can get

[2:47:30]
like see what we can see what we can get
out of this
um and then like yeah refining things
into something which which obviously
ended up like you know working much
better for me rather than having to do
this long slog on my own like instantly
having these guys who could you know
take something which I'd I'd like
written like a paragraph of ideas on and
like you know oftentimes Duty would just

[2:47:45]
like you know oftentimes Duty would just
distill it down into one sentence like
it'd just be like be like some new thing
but he'd just be like oh but like you
know you can just you can just have this
simple if then sentence and that like
encapsulates this like really complex
idea I was trying to get together like
that kind of like blew my mind well but

[2:48:00]
that kind of like blew my mind well but
yeah like that the attitude was uh it
was like it was like like absolutely
amazing so inviting and welcoming I feel
like this is also what you get
When You Reach higher Stakes like the
egos are usually way bigger at lower
Stakes than at higher stakes and people
are way more open-minded because they've

[2:48:17]
are way more open-minded because they've
learned their lesson right they thought
that they were right about something
somewhere along their career and it
turns out they were wrong right and I
think the only way you can reach those
levels and maintain that other level
especially I think maintaining is
important it's only by being open-minded

[2:48:31]
important it's only by being open-minded
by listening to people understanding
that I can learn something from I think
and now over there but I can also
definitely learn something from a 200
player as you pointed out earlier yeah
yeah it's like conversations with guys
playing like lower Stakes to me where
they've like they've just been like you

[2:48:46]
they've like they've just been like you
know sometimes it like I can feel that
same intensiveness when like I went to
talk to them and they'd just be like hey
like you probably already know this but
then they start talking about some cool
things like wait no I've never seen this
before this is so cool like really and
then like you know digging into like

[2:49:00]
then like you know digging into like
digging into it for like a few hours and
then they're just like you know like so
appreciative they'll just be like oh
yeah really thank you for talking about
this I was just like why are you
thanking me like you just showed me a
cool new line you just made me better
poker oh it's a good win-win right yeah
yeah yeah it's like uh yeah like just

[2:49:15]
yeah yeah it's like uh yeah like just
having that sort of uh you know how like
being being a part of that sort of
environment I feel like is is like great
for my attitudes in a game because I
never really feel like you know even if
I am not sure what to work on there's
always like always someone like going in
some direction or like you know giving

[2:49:31]
some direction or like you know giving
you like the the like springboard to
golf on your own
you mentioned that in order to succeed
in poker in your opinion you need to be
talented I was curious what kind of
talented talents or like characteristics

[2:49:47]
talented talents or like characteristics
you need in order to succeed in poker
and where do you think the ceiling is
for player that don't don't possess
these talents see I think I think yeah I
think you made it difficult for me
because it was just like which one
trying to tell more hard work and I was

[2:50:01]
trying to tell more hard work and I was
just like oh kind of both like I mean it
depends on what stake you want to get to
though like if you want I think
um I think like
if you're like okay so so one Talent is

[2:50:16]
if you're like okay so so one Talent is
that your ability to work it
um like one thing I've always said like
what right from when I first started
playing was that I have a talent in the
sense that the work doesn't feel like
work I don't have to like you know have
a disciplined rigorous schedule to get

[2:50:31]
a disciplined rigorous schedule to get
in a lot of study hours I just enjoy it
and I feel like that just gives me an
immediate edge of all the people who
have to drag themselves to looking at
the solver
um I do think like there is like an
upper bounding which is sort of

[2:50:45]
upper bounding which is sort of
determined by talent but like it
obviously doesn't get you there like
especially in the land of solves as well
there's a lot of room to get to
uh to get to a certain level just by
like grinding things out
um
and I find that I kind of have a lot of
respect for that because it's just like

[2:51:00]
respect for that because it's just like
I you know I can't be the type of person
who does like
you know insane hours on like you know
like grinding the prescription things
like I'm trying to you know someone who
like Works more on my intuition
um but you know there are people who can

[2:51:15]
um but you know there are people who can
do that but like yeah again I think that
sort of falls under talent in a weird
way is it like it is it sounds kind of
strange but like
I think um
yeah I mean I mean like they're they're
like if someone if someone like lacks
discipline
yeah I guess I I don't know I I I'm

[2:51:31]
yeah I guess I I don't know I I I'm
always on the fence about this one like
like I I find it hard to say because
I've seen people who are like they're
clearly motivated but they're not making
like they're not making that much
progress but like also I'm not like I'm
not like intimately familiar with like

[2:51:46]
not like intimately familiar with like
how much work they're actually doing
like I'm sure I'm sure you've seen
plenty of people who talk a good game
about like how passionate they are and
how much they want to study
um
and then it's like when it actually
comes down to doing the work like I've

[2:52:00]
comes down to doing the work like I've
had people
um like back before I I had people ask
me to do coaching just privately I was
like yeah sure I'll do coaching
um because like I I just enjoy it
um and then it'll just be like
I'd be like asking them what they worked

[2:52:15]
I'd be like asking them what they worked
on in the past week and it would
basically be like no no the way they
worked was like doing like a private
session with me like I was supposed to
like drag them to the top and like these
could be like smart guys but but like
yeah so so I think I think it's like a
bit about well I mean like the cliche is
what it's like

[2:52:31]
what it's like
um
hard work beats Talent when talent
doesn't work hard
[Music]
um
but yeah I think I think if someone's
like generally like pretty decent at
maths and like loves the game and is
prepared to put in the hours like they
can definitely beat mid Stakes I just

[2:52:45]
can definitely beat mid Stakes I just
think that sometimes sometimes yeah
there's probably like
you know it's just like where do you
draw the ceiling at like 500 an hour
like 1K 2K or like can this person go to
nosebleeds
um I think yeah like another side of
talent as well is like

[2:53:00]
talent as well is like
um
your ability to perform despite your
emotions like I know some people who are
like incredibly smart people and like
I've heard I can't remember who Doug
mentioned but like Doug mentioned some
guy who's like an incredibly smart guy
who he'd be saying like I was like oh
this guy's like way better at Theory

[2:53:15]
this guy's like way better at Theory
than me like this guy could never crack
like the like you know nosebleeds high
stakes heads-up world
um because
like because he just like struggled to
struggle to perform in that environment
like the you know the emotions would get

[2:53:30]
like the you know the emotions would get
too much like almost instantly for him
to for him to execute well and that yeah
I think that is just that is sort of a
form of talent like if you work on it as
as much as you want and like you know
you can't you can't get yourself to you
can't get yourself to calm down like
shoving like you know like shoving your

[2:53:46]
shoving like you know like shoving your
stack in at 40K like if you can't if you
can't do that like cold-bloodedly then
like obviously that puts a cap on like
the you know how far you can take it
yeah I would definitely I definitely
agree with especially the the the final
point

[2:54:00]
point
like naturally some players will have
less resistance towards risk towards
variance towards losing and therefore
they will experience less emotions while
playing and they just their access
towards the knowledge that they have is
always close to 100 and other people

[2:54:17]
always close to 100 and other people
perform in a compromise State way easier
like only a small thing has to happen
and they get thrown off their A-game for
example now I do think obviously you can
work on everything but obviously it's a

[2:54:30]
work on everything but obviously it's a
way more tiring process for one where if
the other one is naturally more talented
to perform uh at their best more
frequently yeah then obviously that
person will have an easy time I don't
think it's impossible for the other
person it kind of depends the severeness

[2:54:45]
person it kind of depends the severeness
of the triggers and what's underneath
and how much he's willing to go there
and to resolve it
um
but yeah obviously Talent does help and
I do I do agree that if we talk about
nosebleed like there has to be something

[2:55:00]
nosebleed like there has to be something
different
then then yeah then just your average
person yeah you need you need to be able
to pretend that this isn't a stupid
amount of money that you're playing
cards with like you need to you you need
to be able to forget that
um
it's kind of nice like when you're

[2:55:15]
it's kind of nice like when you're
playing online and you can switch it
into big lines uh yeah that definitely
also helps between Stakes for anyone who
doesn't play in big blinds like if you
play Stakes different Stakes just switch
everything to big blind yeah I mean it
was definitely yeah if weird like

[2:55:31]
was definitely yeah if weird like
playing live and just like you know
picking up a 5k chip and I was just like
this doesn't like this feels silly like
this should be like they're big trips
and all but like this should feel like
like they should have more like heft to
it like you know you would just say I

[2:55:45]
it like you know you would just say I
raised you to 5 000 points yeah yeah I
mean yeah it's kind of I don't know I
like like yeah I I I felt like within
like half an hour into the first day of
playing that like I'd never played like
200 400 before but like the money was
Monopoly money to me like not obviously

[2:56:02]
Monopoly money to me like not obviously
not like disrespecting it but you know
like I was just like I was just playing
a strategy game like I'd forgotten that
it was like
yeah yeah like um
yeah so it's like uh and like I don't

[2:56:18]
yeah so it's like uh and like I don't
know I never had to work for that you
know like that was just sort of uh like
one of my friends described me as like
the only guy he knew who could play the
World Series of Poker final table like
it was play money

[2:56:30]
it was play money
um which uh which yeah I think is a is
like a pretty uh
yeah pretty nice uh like like a pretty
nice advantage and like leg up to have
on people like you know it's just saying
which I'm grateful for because like I
didn't earn that right like yeah I mean

[2:56:45]
didn't earn that right like yeah I mean
it is your words like I'm sure for
example I remember in the sunny podcast
he came across really naturally tenant
as well but I remember he did point out
like listen there's definitely a lot of
things that I had to work on people kind
of just say oh you're a talented no I I
recognize these things I've worked on
these things now disappearance to which

[2:57:01]
these things now disappearance to which
someone has to work on might be
different compared to the other but I
think there is also like the mentality
uh maybe one person to work on it a lot
and kind of saw okay well apparently
this is not for me and quit it and the
other person kept on working on it and
actually resolved it and therefore still

[2:57:16]
actually resolved it and therefore still
made at least a decent poker career so
yeah it's not it's it's partly also how
you deal with The Talented the tenants
that you've been given
um
like it doesn't like you can you can get

[2:57:31]
like it doesn't like you can you can get
the knowledge eventually like if you
grind it down long enough you can get
like the knowledge
I think like Talent mostly affects your
execution
yeah I I would I would agree with that
I would agree with that
I want to know from you we're

[2:57:47]
I want to know from you we're
approaching the at the end of this
conversation what would you like the
main takeaway to be the audience gets
from the conversation we have today with
you
[Music]
it's the most important lesson that you

[2:58:00]
it's the most important lesson that you
want to give the audience before we go
most important lesson uh like don't
um don't end up somewhere by accident
decide
to decide where like you want to be in
life and like get there get there

[2:58:15]
life and like get there get there
incrementally like you don't you don't
you don't have to get but like but like
you you don't have to you don't have to
know like every decision you're gonna
make
I have a
have a sort of like sort of like macro
macro goal which can like it makes it

[2:58:30]
macro goal which can like it makes it
makes the
it makes the smaller decisions feel easy
right like
um
like like well well even even like big
decisions you know if you can put big
decisions in in the context of like okay
well what direction do I want to head in

[2:58:46]
well what direction do I want to head in
what what direction do I want to head in
overall you can uh like rather than
rather than living a life where like
you're only uh Happy coincidentally like
be like be happy because you've gotten
yourself to a place where

[2:59:00]
yourself to a place where
that like where where you're going to be
happy and like the way you do that is by
like working out what that place looks
like and you know get there slowly but
it's it's worth getting there
and then do you have any final questions
for Owen before I let him go

[2:59:15]
for Owen before I let him go
no I thought that was great advice I'd
probably just add a layer on top of that
say and once you decide where you want
to be decide who you need to be you need
to become to bridge that Gap and that
increment and improvements to bridge
that gap between where you are now and
where you want to be in the future I
think is the the main thing so yeah
really good thank you very much for your

[2:59:30]
really good thank you very much for your
time Owen great conversation I look
forward to listening back ends we thank
you yeah I would I wouldn't add
something to that as well it's actually
a question that I sometimes propose to
people I'll be like their day you know I
say what if tomorrow in this case let's
say tomorrow you would have to hop in a

[2:59:46]
say tomorrow you would have to hop in a
game with Owen how would you prepare for
that game and basically start to prepare
for that for your current games like you
will prepare if you would play against
someone because people usually say oh no
wow but if I would be playing high
stakes I would be doing all these things

[3:00:01]
stakes I would be doing all these things
or yeah well guess what if you don't
start doing all these things you will
not reach high things so yeah good
reflection question for the for the
audience listening
let's wrap another podcast full of
wisdom Adam what are your main takeaways

[3:00:15]
wisdom Adam what are your main takeaways
from the conversation we had today with
Owen
yeah I really liked Owen's mindset his
attitude and his overall approach to
poker in life and one of the things that
was coming through to me was his big
picture thinking of want to be the best
player and the best he could be and
reach his full potential and how that

[3:00:31]
reach his full potential and how that
drives all his decision making and his
actions every day he mentioned how he
gets in touch with his values he knows
what those values are he takes some
psychedelics too to get to the bottom of
that but understand your values and
living in alignment with doors and he
mentioned something which I wrote down a

[3:00:45]
mentioned something which I wrote down a
few times trending towards happiness
make sure your daily actions and
activities are trended towards happiness
and they get incremental improvements
towards your goals which I think is
really really big for any poker player
not getting two results orientated and
trying to uh move towards your goals he
then mentions a leak that he had which

[3:01:00]
then mentions a leak that he had which
he had to fix and which he's still
working on when he goes to his C game
which I think players can relate to he
generally tries too hard he almost like
if it gets annoyed in himself for making
mistakes and tries to almost force
himself back to his a game and he's
realized that's a big leak of his that
causes massive deviation strategy which

[3:01:15]
causes massive deviation strategy which
are unnecessary so he's got to really
watch that can stay a change and when he
notices that he's in a compromised state
to create some kind of safety rails to
make sure that he doesn't yeah make
necessary mistakes in those moments he
mentions a theories of Lenin which I
thought was interesting in terms of

[3:01:30]
thought was interesting in terms of
before you do a solver for example or
look for information you write down or
articulate what you already think and
this is really big for getting yourself
to learn retain information and to
remember the answers I think I remember
a study about this where basically they
talked about and basically some some

[3:01:46]
talked about and basically some some
kids about doing a test and they would
basically be some of the kids were told
the answers beforehand and some of them
would write their answers down and then
they'd have to say what they they said
and what the answers were and the
teacher would tell them their answers
after they'd already put forward their
answer and the kids who had already made

[3:02:01]
answer and the kids who had already made
an argument for what the answer were
were learned the information from when
they were right and wrong much more
accurately so it's one of those things
where if we're invested in it we put
some time into thinking then either one
we get validated it's correct or two we
get shown as error in our thinking which

[3:02:15]
get shown as error in our thinking which
indicates a narrative improve and we
remember that information better which I
think is really good and then there's
two things that I think for myself to
follow up on a one was building
mathematical proofs and how to uh apply
that he's gonna if if then if this then
that kind of statements and now we can
use that to uh stress as you're thinking

[3:02:30]
use that to uh stress as you're thinking
as well as build strategies we did some
stuff on probably devices as well in
terms of a projection bias and how we
often project our knowledge on other
people and also we project how we act
and thinking of it as well so I think a
lot of avenues for myself and other
people to uh go deeper into in terms of
exploring these kind of Topics in more

[3:02:47]
exploring these kind of Topics in more
depth but yeah I think we left a lot of
good knowledge there for the listener to
get stuck into how about yourself Renee
what was some of the main takeaways for
you yeah I wanted to actually add on
that one point where we talked about a
and C game and how you sometimes feel
like you're only sea game I think is

[3:03:00]
like you're only sea game I think is
also very important to recognize
variance if it's really your sea game
that you're doing or if it's just
variants that you're just being handed
annoying spots and you ended up losing
the pot for example in my experience
sometimes I can freak out a bit when

[3:03:16]
sometimes I can freak out a bit when
I've been playing for an hour one hour
and things just they're not going my way
let's say I did actually make the right
decision but all the right decisions
ended up folding giving up AKA a lot of
decisions that not made me win the

[3:03:30]
decisions that not made me win the
Potter I'm just losing losing losing
losing but I'm actually losing less if I
would than if I would be making mistakes
so then I might on on rightfully if
that's a word a thing that I'm in my C
game but I'm actually paying very well
it's just not that the pots are going my

[3:03:46]
it's just not that the pots are going my
way so I think it's also important and
sometimes what I can do which is
actually real C game is then I'm just
gonna Force like hey I'm I feel like I'm
getting run over I need I need to do
something I need to I need to make a
move that shows that I'm in control or
something so I think maybe this is just

[3:04:00]
something so I think maybe this is just
me but when you mention that this is
something that popped up so I wanted to
quickly share it
some interesting points that I also
wrote down frequency plates in solvers
are just suggestions and they can be
used as Inspirations what might also be
a good way to play this hand or a good

[3:04:17]
a good way to play this hand or a good
alternative sizing to take or a good
alternative line to take which is also
antonym with what you with what you
mentioned how to look for a solver play
with the variables the if this then then
that that's also definitely something I

[3:04:30]
that that's also definitely something I
wrote out which is very in line with our
philosophy that's also why we have the
mechanics of Poker right we focus behind
the mechanics behind strategies what
happens if certain variables change well
that leads to different outputs so I
always recommend you know the what you
see in the solvers just the toy game is

[3:04:46]
see in the solvers just the toy game is
very static in real life it's not
aesthetic as that things change and we
have to learn what impact the variables
have on our strategy so we can adjust
accordingly to what we actually see
going on at the tables
uh another thing that I like to drag
your opponent into a dark Forest where

[3:05:02]
your opponent into a dark Forest where
only you know the exit and basically
you have to put yourself or put your
opponent in certain line especially I
think this works well when you are the
initial razor where you have a way
better idea of how the ranges actually

[3:05:15]
better idea of how the ranges actually
look like I think he mentioned Stefan
while Stefan plays three button opening
sizings and you can only estimate what
hands are in which range then he knows
very well your range because you're just
gonna defend probably more when

[3:05:30]
gonna defend probably more when
UE opens less and bigger when uh and
fold more when it opens bigger he knows
his range but you don't know his and he
probably has also thought about well my
range for example might miss this board
but you don't know that so you actually
might perceive my range to hit this
board but actually my range misses the

[3:05:46]
board but actually my range misses the
board so you're actually overfolding in
a spot where you might actually Shoot
actually over calling because my range
doesn't really hit this board so there's
very there's a lot of deep things you
can go into here because like in a real
solver there's no such thing as a
perceived range because the solver knows

[3:06:01]
perceived range because the solver knows
both ranges but in practice we only play
with perceived ranges so you can
definitely definitely use that to your
advantage
um and I also wrote down a thing that's
not a thing can become a thing and I
have to think about why I wrote that I

[3:06:15]
have to think about why I wrote that I
remember he he mentioned like oh let's
say for example there's a spot where
there's no raises I think he mentions
the three party faces seabed if there's
no race for the in position player well
what if you race how should villain
respond and if you think villain will

[3:06:30]
respond and if you think villain will
screw up on the response then raising
suddenly becomes a thing
so it's thinking one step ahead like if
I do this thing that's not a thing does
he respond in a way that makes it a
thing that's kind of to go full circle
if people still following what I'm
saying after a three-hour conversation

[3:06:45]
saying after a three-hour conversation
all right wrapping this uh wrapping this
spot up I want to thank Owen for coming
