and this is the thing with the rngs if
you're gonna roll dice or balance
certain bluffing frequencies in certain
scenarios
you might fall into the trap that you
start randomizing with a hand that's
never a bluff
okay that's one or you start randomizing
a hand that's always a bluff
hello and welcome back to the channel
i'm here today
for you guys with another video where we
are going to look
at bluffing but before we get into the
good stuff
remember that if you like this video
give it a thumbs up
also subscribe to the channel as we will
be releasing more content
in the future without further ado let's
get
into the example today
we are dealt h5 suited great hands in
the small blind
we decided to raise it up and see that
the flop turn
was a queen we decided to check and
villain checked behind and on the river
falls on nine
and it's up to us with a 5 and
the question is do we bluff or don't we
bluff
as always i will consult biosolver
for this question what does he consult
us to do
he will say that ace five is usually a
check
sometimes in bed in this case the
batting will probably
come mainly from the ace five of
diamonds because the ace five of
diamonds is unblocking hands that
it will float to flop with unfold the
river melee hands like ace loses spades
h3 of hearts a's four of clubs etc
so basically if we have ace five and
diamonds villains fault equity will be a
little bit higher than if he would have
h5
spades and in theory you know one
percent more faults can make the
difference between
a bluff being plus v or bluff being
minus v
remember it's a solver everything is
quite close
[Music]
so to blow over another block what to
take in consideration well as
i just mentioned blockers are we
blocking villains calling range or
folding range
if we look at ace five here we are
blocking well maybe king five off so if
villain had that could check back to
turn call the river
a 786 if those hands you think will call
we are indeed blocking some calls
but like i said mainly we are blocking
some i would say
auto we are blocking hands that are sort
of automatically folding the river like
ace
8 ace 10 ace 5 etc etc so i wouldn't
necessarily say ace 5 is a great hand
blocker wise to bluff with
range advantage the stronger range the
more and bigger we can bet
this is also a general principle um
which you should take in consideration
if you are deciding to bluff
in this case do we have a ranged
advantage i think so we could still be
checking strong in the turn i don't
think it's very likely our opponents
will check
back strong hands on the turn in
position himself
in general when you're out of position
you're more inclined to
check strong hands because there's still
a chance villain will bet then we can
race
whereas if you're in position you're on
a turn if you check behind with a strong
hand
you have missed the opportunity to get
two streets of value
so i don't think finn has a lot of
strong hands here
and we can still check strong hands on
the turn
i think the nine we can improve the
pocket nines which i think he will three
bets we can have queen nine he can have
green nine we can have king nine he can
have
king nine seven nine yeah for the rest
is quite evenly divided
so from that point of view yes we should
bet what does my rng
say aka how did heidi that role for the
guys who don't know what
rng is basically it's a random number
generator
and it's a concept i think it was
popularized
on the training side run it once and
then mainly by ben
solsky basically you know you're just
mixing up your frequencies
like a solver however do remember this
is usually just an
attempt to play balance at it's very
hard in-game to know
what kind of frequency a solver will
make a certain play
how high did that roll kind of comes
from the dice like okay
a number from one to six then six is the
most aggressive action and one is the
most passive action
does my story check out question mark
how much potential
do i have what are you representing
basically i'm usually a big fan
of seeing poker or seeing playing a
poker hand as a story
you're trying to tell a story that will
make sense for your opponent
so in this case if my opponent has a
seven
i want to tell a story that i have
better than a seven so
i will take a line and use a certain
sizing
uh in this case maybe for example small
sizing so i could be
representing a nine which is very bad
for a hand like a seven
but these are all nice points to
consider but actually i wanted to focus
a little bit more on the last point
given the trend or topic of this video
are all these points above relevant
given the tendencies of
human beings in this case population and
or my current opponent
so if we take a look at the same
example and we take a look at what
villain is supposed to do in theory
if we bet at three quarters bad fitting
is supposed to fall 46
of the time and here we can kind of see
the hands that villains should be
playing this way
in this case blue is full and usually
when you start analyzing
a river spot in a solver
it's always a good idea to take a look
at okay which kind of hands is villain
bluffing with
which kind of hands is villain folding
and then using your
brain and common sense and knowledge and
experience as a
as as as a poker player to figure out if
you think this is relevant so do you
think
it is uh
do you think it makes sense that villain
will will always call you with pocket
deuces on the river
i personally don't think so i think
though
that hand is most likely folding and
again here you will see the blockers in
play
fives is a absolute stronger hand than
pocket deuces but apparently
if they're both bluff catchers and if we
have deuces
villain will have for example like a
hand like ace five that he can bluff
with so you would prefer to call with a
hand like pocket deuces
because it's not blocking any blast okay
but given the topic of this chapter
population versus the solver
what does the population do if we take a
look at the blind versus blind example
and we take a look at the high level
board
we can see that the fault versus
batching bad three-quarters
is around 55 and they raised around nine
point six percent
whereas if we then compare what does
population do compared to silver and
basically you always have to make this
comparison to see if a silver output is
relevant
or at least like if the population would
fold exactly 46
and raise exactly 13. 0.2
we should always follow the solver it's
very relevant however
as soon as your opponent or your
population starts to deviate
uh the highest if you play would be to
adjust
and exploit your opponent
so the question now is should we rng or
roll a dice with h5 suited
should we balance our bluffing
frequencies with a hand like h5
suited or should we take the fact that
we have a poor blocker
very high in our list of considerations
that's my question to you do you
if you said no okay or came up with a
whole bunch of
yes but think about them for a second
and analyze it's relevant so
should we rng or dice here if you said
yes
but blah blah blah i want you to kind of
write down the bots now for a moment
and think about them and see how
relevant they are
if you said something like yes but then
i'll be over bluffing
this is something that i hear quite
often when i say okay i think ice fat is
a suit here should be a bluff
and then i usually ask them is that
really a problem if someone is over
folding think about this for a second do
you want to play balanced
or spoiler do you want to make an
attempt of
playing balanced gto or do you want to
play
a strategy that in a vacuum is highest
ev a maximizing strategy
i would say that if someone is over
folding we should be over bluffing
that's kind of the
whole nature of how you can generate
higher ev in poker
so save yourself the overthinking and
start with the last question first
like i said yes it indeed had poor
blockers
we were maybe blocking we were not
really blocking hands that would call we
were blocking the men that would fold
but in the end how big is the gap that
we're playing with you saw the gap
between what population is doing and
what the solver is doing was quite big
so a blocker is not going to be the
difference between our bluff being
plus v or minus a v
in the end guys it's as simple as this
as this folders are going to fold and
colors are going to call
so if you have a guy who is a happy
caller he's most probably over calling
if you have a guy who's a happy folder
he's most probably over folding
so if you would say that this is the
response of
our opponent which as we saw in the data
is more likely i don't think pocket
deuces will
call i think all these low pocket
players will probably just fold
i think i had like a six suited will
probably also fault
basically i made him fold most of the
six acts
and some 7x i started to make him hero
call
and it's up to you to ask yourself
versus the opponent that you're playing
or
is the population that you're playing
how you think folding frequencies will
look like and
just just look at the hands and
intuitively also for yourself
would you call here at pocket deuces
yeah i wouldn't cover her with pocket
deuces
[Music]
so for the for the next time someone is
in this situation
exploit me i won't call you with pocket
deuces i promise you
and here we will see the correct
adjustment so the maximizing strategy
versus a response as shown here on the
left which was
equivalent to what population is most
likely doing and now we can see that ace
flat suited has become a pure bluff okay
there's now a flipping point
yes ace five of diamonds is probably
still the highest ev bluff
however not bluffing with ace five of
spades right now
is a less plus of b than bluffing okay
so therefore we bluff
and now i can already hear a couple of
you guys
what about balance okay what about
balance
balance can't be reached in game
okay there's only attempt to play
correctly and this is the thing with
the rngs if you're gonna roll dice or
balance certain bluffing frequencies in
certain scenarios
you might fall into the trap that you
start randomizing with a hand that's
never a bluff
okay that's one or you start randomizing
a hand that's always a bluff
okay we cannot understand poker
completely
our opponent can never defend gto in
this situation
okay he will not on the fly see
exactly how his range looks he will
always be off by a couple of percent
and a solver output a couple of percent
will usually
lean the strategy towards extreme left
or right as we saw in the previous video
if you haven't checked that one out in
the bluff catching video
where we went from a balanced calling
range on the river to a zero percent
folding range
and if you start playing around with
solver
and adding in some scenarios that are
way more likely in practice you will see
this
occurring more often and the last point
i wanted to look at
to listing considerations does villains
show up with the hands that fall on the
river
and what i mean with that is let's say
half villain indeed was folding loses to
fives
let's say videon already folds his hand
on the flop then
obviously we should maybe adjust our
bluffing frequencies on the river
because he will basically
have way less hands that are going to
fold okay this is a general concept if
you start
bluffing certain hands if you want to
block certain hands on the river
do make sure villain actually showed up
to the river with those hands
so main takeaway for you guys
for this bluffing video i want you guys
to prevent
overthinking and start what with what is
most relevant
if you play 100 and l50nl etc etc please
don't start rng and try to balance your
ranges
and in my senses you can already hear
this i say try to balance your ranges
it's impossible to do and a waste of
time
point number two you should think less
and this is kind of a recurring one
from the previous video from bluff
catching as well thinking less about how
your range should play
on theory on the river it's obviously
good to have a theoretical understanding
of how this spot should be played
mainly because then if in this case we
are in the big blind
and we know that h5 suited shouldn't be
bluffing and we see someone bluffing we
know that it's likely that he is over
bluffing
okay it's always and i've said this in
the previous video as well
it's never an excuse to not use a solver
because in order to
exploit someone correctly we first need
to know what is right
okay so definitely important to know
what is theoretically correct in a spot
like that
and then from there we can see if
population
if you think your current opponents are
gonna approach the spot in the same way
and from there think more about what
your opponent has try to figure out what
the guy has
and then figure out if the guy is
willing to fold or not
okay so in that example that we gave you
think your opponent is
likely to fall at seven and a six if
your answer is yes please always bluff
with h5
if you think he's never folding those
hands and you think you've all
has already folded pocket press on the
flop please do not bluff h5
okay and last but not least
again things are often not close in
practice so blockers matter less
again this is the whole example with the
ace five of diamonds is probably your
best bluff compared to ace five of
spades
however the blocker impact in practice
is not going to make the difference
between something being plus v
or minus ev it's only going to increase
or decrease
the v of already that already was with
that hand
so i hope you guys like this video
and start to bluff various spots
in too high the frequency get called and
afterwards send me a lot of angry
messages
wanting your money back as always we
cannot be held responsible for you
making certain plus and your opponent
calling with hands that you should not
be calling with
so please be careful uh these are
actually great spots that if you make a
bluff and you think someone is folding
but he didn't fold a certain hand
probably good to reevaluate that
situation if your
initial read was right if you haven't
done so
