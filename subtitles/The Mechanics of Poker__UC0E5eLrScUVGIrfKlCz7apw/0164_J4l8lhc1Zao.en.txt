you particularly curious about to

[02:01]
you particularly curious about to
discuss with Andrew

longevity in polka has been very
impressive I think I was following look
at shimmy before I even play poker I
think it's a kind of living high stakes
high stakes poker life with other

high stakes poker life with other
players I remember getting inspired by
professional players living in Vegas and
being making lots of money and also I
want to really dig into his kind of
background into spirituality I know he
went deep into kind of meditation and
yoga a very practical practices that

apply those to the port of context to
have more success in recent times so

episode with Andrew
all right Mr Chewie thank you for coming
on the pot I've really looked forward to
uh to having this episode personally
yeah well thanks for having me I'm happy
to be here

[04:01]
to be here
I don't actually really ask this
question often but this time I'm uh very
curious and have not been able to find
it anywhere where did the nickname lucky
Chewie came from
so Chewie came from third grade my

[04:16]
so Chewie came from third grade my
mother would pack granola bars with my
lunch and my classmates recognized this
every day I'd be eating a granola bar
and uh one of my friends started calling
me Chewie and that kind of just stuck
with me throughout my youth and then
when I found online poker I was already

[04:31]
when I found online poker I was already
chewy in my own mind and I figured okay
playing good is important then being
lucky is also important and hence lucky
Chewy was born
nice now that is a good nickname like my
personal nickname is the wacko and they

[04:45]
personal nickname is the wacko and they
just invented it because people said I
was a bit crazy in the beginning so you
know weko that kind of wrote my mind
what was your what was your nickname
Adam and did it have any do you have any
backstory there
mine was super original mine was my name
Adam say well Adam Carmike girl and then

[05:01]
Adam say well Adam Carmike girl and then
the yeah the my date of birth so not
very original to be fair usually when I
see something like that I kind of have
like a fish suspection so from that
point of view have made you I think you
made a good level but I think it's a
really a really I really like the story

[05:15]
really a really I really like the story
behind your nickname uh Mr Chewie uh I I
know you are big on spirituality and we
will go deeper in that later in the pot
but just to start it off as calling
yourself lucky and believing you are
lucky contribute to more luck and if so

[05:30]
lucky contribute to more luck and if so
how in your opinion would that work
well that is a great question and it's
it's in some ways the question is like
how deep does the rabbit hole Go I mean
I think generally positive thinking is a
good thing it's kind of just a free roll
right being optimistic

[05:46]
right being optimistic
um believing just fundamentally good
things will happen to you
um I've just sort of always been this
way I think it's largely the influence
of my parents but
uh you know testing out different
methodologies that

[06:00]
methodologies that
um you know you can apply to your life
I've found this to be preferable
um as far as like you know when you
start to get into more metaphysical or
Quantum type things how much does this
actually change physical reality I don't
know

[06:15]
know
um I would like to think that it does
I've had certain experiences where it
makes you question things and you feel
like maybe you have more autonomy over
this realm so to speak
um but yeah I don't know I I would like

[06:30]
um but yeah I don't know I I would like
to think that it does
yeah for for maybe for the listeners
when you say like quantum physics or do
we the the way I kind of understand it
uh and my my education purely comes from
Mr Joe dispenza is like there's a sort
of energy around us and if we align with

[06:46]
of energy around us and if we align with
that energy we attract a certain reality
towards us so like a reality in which
you're always lucky for example lucky
chewy that's a reality you align with by
uh I guess altering your state to a
higher level higher waves higher energy

[07:02]
higher level higher waves higher energy
and then that luckier version will
actually happen to you now do I say this
about right this is kind of what we're
talking about I completely agree with
that the way I would maybe shorten it is
you know if we exist in a Multiverse

[07:15]
you know if we exist in a Multiverse
then any sort of you know freeze frame
of that Multiverse can be accessed by
tuning yourself to sort of the right
frequency within it I'm also a fan of Dr
Joe dispenza so that resonates with me
as well
yeah for for the listeners who are uh

[07:32]
yeah for for the listeners who are uh
after this podcast a bit curious I would
definitely advise his knowledge as I
think he is a good bridge between logic
and spirituality like he explains things
in a way that's very understandable for

[07:45]
in a way that's very understandable for
a lot of logic logical thinking people
they're like ah this actually makes a
lot of sense right uh I think he gives
the gives the example I think it was in
one of his books where he talks about
you know signals that you send from the
brain to your body will have a

[08:01]
brain to your body will have a
physiological effect and at some point
he says well you know our our audience
is 99 mil uh if you think about a hot
woman naked or something it sends
signals in this case to your genitals
and you will get a physical reaction

[08:15]
and you will get a physical reaction
right I was like ah that makes a lot of
sense and then you think he I think I
think he says about like five other
points in your body or like stress you
know all this kind of stuff so if you if
you're constantly thinking like negative
thoughts uh thinking that you're unlucky
I I I I'm on your side here I definitely

[08:31]
I I I I'm on your side here I definitely
believe this has a negative impact right
you also get like a negative bias or you
put sort of negative glasses on through
which you see the world and you're kind
of highlighting the negative all the
time which as you said if true or false
we don't know but at least it's a

[08:46]
we don't know but at least it's a
positive free role right to to have a
positive unlucky attitude towards life
yeah definitely and I I really believe
that the ripple effect is quite profound
so you know the beliefs you have the way
that they affect you know not just now

[09:01]
that they affect you know not just now
but your future experiences
um I've found that to be you know quite
relevant and and to your point about you
know your mind affecting your physiology
I use that when I play as well in a more
practical sense if I feel too because I

[09:16]
practical sense if I feel too because I
can get quite excitable I think that's
why I took well to you know whether it's
yoga or meditation or what have you
because they calm you down I'll often
you know visualize my heart or you know
my breath and my heart and just try to
like relax at the table

[09:32]
like relax at the table
um because yeah just you know staying
calm and focused as paramounts and I
really enjoy poker so I get very excited
when I play
this is so how would people be people go
through it let's say for example I go

[09:46]
through it let's say for example I go
play Live which I don't often do I can
find that quite exciting let's say you
make a big Bluff for quote quote real
money you know your heart starts
pounding but like some practical tips
like what I usually try to do I try to
focus on breathing like slowing down my

[10:00]
focus on breathing like slowing down my
breath doing like some sort of box
breeding for me really calms me down at
the table and makes me think clearly uh
I also in my mind usually go over why I
think this is such a great Bluff doesn't
work if in hindsight I think it's not a
great Bluff that I might get a little

[10:15]
great Bluff that I might get a little
bit nervous but what are the likes of
practical tips for for the listeners
here yeah I definitely agree with that I
think when I really believe and have
confidence in the play
um it quells any sort of anxiety that
might accompany it
um as far as like your heart beating

[10:30]
um as far as like your heart beating
quickly during a block I tend to feel
like when that happens to me it's either
some combination of I haven't really
calmed myself down going into it and
it's like that ship has sailed you just
gotta live with it at that point
um or it's you know as mentioned like

[10:46]
um or it's you know as mentioned like
it's just not a great play I'm forcing
um but you know sometimes my heart rate
will accelerate when I have good hands
and and large amounts as well so yeah I
just ideally want to be in like a calm
relaxed State and I do think that's kind

[11:01]
relaxed State and I do think that's kind
of an ever-present uh challenge
um you know when playing poker
yeah you talked about like sort of
pre-session preparation so I the way I
see it you can work on it like from a
long term and we will get deeper into

[11:15]
long term and we will get deeper into
like meditation and stuff like that and
also like short term that's a bit more I
guess sort of priming or getting
yourself in the right State before you
playing uh I think you practice both if
I'm correct right
yeah I've toyed around with different
techniques um meditation is still very

[11:32]
techniques um meditation is still very
much a part of my life
um pre-session sort of techniques I
don't really have too much rigidity
there I found that trying to you know
execute or implement the same kind of

[11:45]
execute or implement the same kind of
routine
um just felt a bit limiting and I I felt
like it was actually counterproductive
so
you know in the mornings I just try to
do whatever it is that feels right on
any given day and then just you know be
comfortable when I head into the casino
to play

[12:01]
to play
it's actually a good point I I've talked
to some other people so I'm personally
quite rigid in terms of like my schedule
around like playing days but then I hear
other people say that that actually only
sort of increases stress so they they I
guess feel too much pressure when they

[12:16]
guess feel too much pressure when they
do that and it's what you pointed out
maybe some days your your needs are
different than other days I can totally
see that so you might you have to be a
little bit flexible in that or at least
people who experience it I personally
don't really experience that there's
like a set a set routine that I go

[12:31]
like a set a set routine that I go
through and I don't experience uh any
any negativity around that you you
already mentioned your your family in
there and in terms of your beliefs why
do you think and I've heard you talk
about beliefs before why do you think
beliefs are so important uh whether it

[12:47]
beliefs are so important uh whether it
is actually in poker or or in life why
are there like I think you you mentioned
it's like the sort of the foundation
from which to where the rest sort of
flourishes
yeah it's a good question um

[13:00]
yeah it's a good question um
I mean I guess the way that uh I sort of
have structured
my belief system is that uh I suppose
you know this idea of underlies beliefs
generally but I feel like they are kind
of the foundation by which you live your

[13:17]
of the foundation by which you live your
life that which you believe to be true
are things that you just do
um
so yeah you uh you know it's important I
guess to check in with yourself and make

[13:31]
guess to check in with yourself and make
sure that your beliefs do actually align
with who you are and that you don't have
um you know sort of autopilot type
I guess
mechanisms or programs at play which

[13:45]
mechanisms or programs at play which
have just sort of existed in your
subconscious and are affecting you when
that's not actually the way you prefer
to live
mm-hmm
does actually it actually makes a lot of
that actually makes a lot of sense what
are what are like some signs that

[14:01]
are what are like some signs that
your beliefs might not be aligned with
what you're doing maybe in your
experience or things that you've
observed in other people
um I guess I would say any sort of like

[14:15]
um I guess I would say any sort of like
um negative emotion or
experience outside the norm where you
feel like something was brought on by
like it almost it's like oh this just
happened I don't really know why this
happened or now I'm upset I tend to
think those are instances where you can

[14:32]
think those are instances where you can
usually gain some insight into
um you know who you really are and how
you've been operating perhaps out of
alignment with who you truly are
yeah I usually reflect and if I

[14:46]
yeah I usually reflect and if I
experience emotions which I think I
quote quote should not be experiencing
at that moment or like wait why is this
emotions present in this moment this
makes no sense or I overreact to a
certain situation that's usually a good

[15:01]
certain situation that's usually a good
time to in the moment is quite hard of
course to step back a little bit but
after after the moment you can reflect
on it like hey why did I react show out
of proportion to this single event or
why did I feel this way in like why did
I feel a lot of fear that I wanted to go

[15:17]
I feel a lot of fear that I wanted to go
away from a situation in a spot where I
was put in a great opportunity for
example that's something that I've
personally experienced whereas like a
certain fear of failure like oh the
opportunity now arises so I should be
very happy right and excited but instead

[15:32]
very happy right and excited but instead
I might feel anxiety or I might feel
that I want to get away from the
situation where it's like oh apparently
I have a certain belief that when the
opportunity arises that might not be up
for the job
yeah I can totally relate to that and uh

[15:46]
yeah I can totally relate to that and uh
I would say that initially when those
things happen you know kind of makes you
want to run away from those emotions but
over time I've sort of felt like oh
these are actually just the keys to kind
of unlock you know whatever's going on

[16:01]
of unlock you know whatever's going on
that is preventing you from feeling the
way that you you know as you put it
quote unquote should feel or ideally
wants to feel or or feel more natural I
suppose
yeah I think the natural tendency
especially in the beginning is to try to

[16:15]
especially in the beginning is to try to
escape right we try to look for
distractions so we don't feel that
certain way anymore uh but yeah it will
it will keep on coming back if you put
yourself in similar situations so I
think the long or the the sustainable
Way Forward is indeed to use them as

[16:31]
Way Forward is indeed to use them as
sort of a compass right like oh
apparently there's something there let
me let me check out what's underneath
unpleasant in the moment unpleasant in
the beginning but definitely worth it I
would say in the long term you already
mentioned like certain beliefs obviously
were already created by how you were

[16:46]
were already created by how you were
raised by your family I think I believe
that you're for example lucky chewy
you're very optimistic right you already
mentioned do you see this kind of as a
free role is this something that you
were kind of uh spoot fed from your

[17:02]
were kind of uh spoot fed from your
upbringing by your by your family like
hey Mr Chewie you can do whatever you
want be optimistic is it kind of the
same philosophy they have towards life
that they gave to you
um yeah I would say so my my father is

[17:15]
um yeah I would say so my my father is
very happy kind of go lucky guy and uh
very goofy I think I get a lot of my
sort of goofy nature from him
um so yeah I I definitely you know have
a debt of gratitude for the way that he
has chosen to exist in the world and the

[17:32]
has chosen to exist in the world and the
way that that's impacted my personality
as well
would you say that this has helped you
also to choose
a career path that's maybe not as
obvious as you know other career pets
that were available you in this case

[17:46]
that were available you in this case
poker you need a certain optimism right
if you're gonna go gambling for a living
um so he definitely helped me in other
ways just generally being supportive
about taking uh you know a less beaten

[18:00]
about taking uh you know a less beaten
path so to speak
um this specifically I don't know
um again I imagine it probably doesn't
hurt but I was just very into games and
you know once I found poker which of
course is a game that you can

[18:16]
course is a game that you can
do quite well at if you really apply
yourself I think that was kind of the
you know the most helpful aspect which
is I was already into strategic
um endeavors and yeah just fit nicely

[18:30]
um endeavors and yeah just fit nicely
yeah we hate this quite often with the
players coming on the part that they had
a history in gaming I heard you play
chess what's up back then already or
were we talking more like video games
board games
I did play some chess not really too
much I was much more into blizzard games

[18:47]
much I was much more into blizzard games
though Warcraft Starcraft Diablo
Warcraft 3 was a game I put a lot of
time into
um yeah I played those games for maybe
three or four years before I found poker

[19:00]
three or four years before I found poker
and I would even kind of multitask in
the early going so I was like oh well I
can play both the same time and I
quickly realized like well I can just
play more tables that's probably a
better idea and really focused on what
I'm doing uh So eventually I had to put
the blizzard games down to rest

[19:17]
the blizzard games down to rest
how have you found so for example I used
to like a lot of video games as well but
then I spent more time on online poker
and then I kind of figured that if I
wasn't playing online poker to then
spend time playing video games as well
was a bit Yeah a bit too much time

[19:31]
was a bit Yeah a bit too much time
behind the computer for me did you maybe
at some point struggle with okay I have
to give up maybe like a certain passion
for video games because I'm already
spending so much time in online poker or
for you there was no problem like oh I I
continued playing my online poker
session now let's let's get into some

[19:46]
session now let's let's get into some
Warcraft
yeah I mean once I found poker and kind
of really got into it honestly I just
dropped all the games I think it was
largely a byproduct of sort of
recognized where I was in my life I
found poker end of high school

[20:01]
found poker end of high school
um at the time that I was you know going
to college I attended a school nearby
where I was living didn't really have
much ambition to you know pursue a major
or
yeah I mean just nothing was really as

[20:16]
yeah I mean just nothing was really as
interesting as poker so
I recognize that if I really do you know
give this a solid shot for the next year
or two and I'm able to make something of
it uh you know this is a great
opportunity and I was able to identify

[20:31]
opportunity and I was able to identify
that point that people were making a
living doing this
um and of course you know that is what
ended up happening but
yeah the games would have just detracted
from that I was very much all in poker
and
even maybe to an unhealthy degree I mean

[20:47]
even maybe to an unhealthy degree I mean
I was blind a lot and you know studying
as much as I could at that time which
was mostly just reading uh you know old
Forum posts on two plus two reading
articles
um yeah just trying to get my hands on
as much material as I could which would

[21:02]
as much material as I could which would
have been you know any kind of help for
someone who was starting from scratch
I think uh this is a quite a common team
as well right players go through a time
you label it as maybe I spent an
unhealthy amount of time in poker you

[21:17]
unhealthy amount of time in poker you
were obsessed with the game think all
players that we've had on probably went
through a certain phase like that and I
would almost say it's
almost necessary in a certain way uh
obviously now you probably are more

[21:30]
obviously now you probably are more
about like yeah we have to we have to
think about work life balance obsession
is maybe maybe you know another ideal
but I do think it helps in a certain way
uh this could also be Survivor bias by
the way
um
in terms of like comparing poker to the

[21:47]
in terms of like comparing poker to the
games you were playing you already
mentioned you saw more of a actual
career path in poker right you saw the
earning potential those are also like
something about poker that
made you like to play it more than for

[22:00]
made you like to play it more than for
example Warcraft where they're like
certain components to Poker that
Warcraft didn't have that attracted you
towards the game a bit more
yeah I mean if I'm being honest like
poker is just the best game I've ever
found
um
I don't know what makes it that I'm

[22:16]
I don't know what makes it that I'm
curious right unlimited betting uh I
mean okay so no no no no pot limit limit
stuff for you it has to be no limit
yeah I mean I've dabbled in various
formats but I always find myself coming

[22:30]
formats but I always find myself coming
back to hold them
um I play mostly tournaments nowadays
although I did start and play cash games
for quite a few years into my career
um I don't know that I can really
pinpoint what it was about poker but I
found so much more intriguing than

[22:45]
found so much more intriguing than
Warcraft because when I was playing that
I felt like you know this is the best
game I've ever found so
yeah I don't know it's just I guess uh
you know here's one thing there's
obviously a a great deal of complexity
to the game but you can you know

[23:02]
to the game but you can you know
simplify certain aspects of it and even
still every time I play I always learn
something new I just find that pretty
astounding but like no matter how much
you play always something new uh is

[23:16]
you play always something new uh is
presented to you some kind of new
decision Point different range
composition different strategies sizing
so on and so forth so I just love that
it kind of is you know very
intellectually stimulating

[23:31]
intellectually stimulating
yeah I can definitely relate to that I
mean I've been playing poke for I think
12 years and every year when you look
back it's like no no last year you did
not understand the game this year you
understood the game and you know it's
every year it's kind of a repetition of

[23:46]
every year it's kind of a repetition of
of the same but it's interesting it's
just like life in a certain way right
you see it's this you you get the same
hands you see the same flop but you see
something different in the Flop every
time right with when when your knowledge
increase so I guess it's a bit like life
as well you know you put different

[24:01]
as well you know you put different
glasses on and you see the same
situation but maybe because of your
certain beliefs or because in this case
you gained a certain knowledge you now
know a certain concept that you didn't
know before you suddenly see different
possibilities or different threats that
you didn't see before right that lets
you to make certain mistakes or filter

[24:16]
you to make certain mistakes or filter
to make better plays in the past so once
your knowledge increases the same game
but like you said obviously certain
situations small new ones has changed
but also it can be exactly the same
situation but due to gay knowledge you
just see something different in the
exact same flop that you didn't see

[24:30]
exact same flop that you didn't see
before it was there but you didn't see
it yeah and sometimes that's just the
foresight about various terms of rivers
which is impacting their current
decision uh but yeah so having your
knowledge base grow and just an overall
understanding grow I really enjoy that

[24:47]
understanding grow I really enjoy that
especially when different ideas coalesce
and you have more cohesive thoughts
about things and
you see how different parts of the game
tree connect yeah just a never-ending
process of
in some ways self-discovery but

[25:01]
in some ways self-discovery but
certainly discovery of the game
yeah I remember some of those moments
that you mentioned where you actually
came to the conclusion when you come to
the conclusion why you always get into
shitty spots it's like oh it's like you
said oh I always get it this River

[25:16]
said oh I always get it this River
scenario oh wait I should have just done
something different at an earlier street
so I don't get in this situation anymore
it's like oh wow so that's so that's so
that's why I keep screwing myself yeah
exactly it's like boom yeah that's a

[25:32]
exactly it's like boom yeah that's a
there's certain Concepts in poker that
once you learn it it's like wow oh wow
so this is how it works uh which is
which is really fascinating and I hope
to still have many more of those
experience to come in the future

[25:46]
after you got introduced to Poker uh I
think you mentioned you know you played
video games and then after high school
you transitioned into poker I read
somewhere that I think you were losing
online for the first 18 months what made

[26:00]
online for the first 18 months what made
you continue to play the game despite
not being able to win
well I guess in some ways my previous
experience with computer games helped
there because I was not particularly
great at those when I started either and

[26:15]
great at those when I started either and
then
you know just sticking with it and kind
of eventually getting the hang of it
understanding sort of similar things
that happen in poker various patterns
that emerge uh eventually I was able to
reach you know reasonably high level of
competition

[26:31]
competition
so in some ways I felt like okay this is
just a repetition of that obviously it's
you know now costing you money and it is
a different game so it was quite a
testing time and that was where I would
say you know my father's kind of support

[26:45]
say you know my father's kind of support
not feeling any sort of pressure from
him as if you know I imagine for many
people uh their parents aren't
particularly supportive and feel like
they're throwing their lives away
um but yeah so he's just like it makes

[27:00]
um but yeah so he's just like it makes
you happy and I believe in you and that
was great so yeah stuck with it and
obviously it worked out
I guess it's also again
a certain belief right that other people
maybe when they start to play poker and
they lose for one month straight they're

[27:16]
they lose for one month straight they're
like well apparently this is not for me
right they're very sort of fixed mindset
type of thinking whereas you kind of
felt like oh well I'm usually [ __ ] at
things when I start uh and when I put in
the work I get better so you don't see

[27:30]
the work I get better so you don't see
losing as sort of attack on your
personality like oh why and I think I
think this is quite common with kids who
are labeled like very smart in the
beginning right that they're like oh
well apparently I'm smart I'm good at
stuff and then when they say something
that they're not good at they
immediately kind of retreat well

[27:45]
immediately kind of retreat well
apparently you know I'm a smart kid but
apparently this is not for me whereas if
you kind of learned that in the
beginning you know you have a certain
natural learning curve You Don't Stray
away from yeah adversity in the
beginning and I think that's kind of a
belief that that plays a role here

[28:01]
belief that that plays a role here
yeah yeah definitely uh
I guess I'll mention that um you know
fortunately it wasn't a straight down
experience I have you know moments of
success you you you you could taste it a

[28:15]
success you you you you could taste it a
little bit like oh so this is what it
tastes like yeah and I did even from the
get-go
um you know I was able to identify
certain things that I was improving at
I'll never forget there was one day
where I was

[28:30]
where I was
um it had like snowed a lot in the town
I grew up in and school got canceled uh
this was you know end of high school and
I was playing like all night on party
and they had just opened like uh two
four three six No Limit tables for the

[28:45]
four three six No Limit tables for the
longest time they only had two one two
full-ring tables they used to get like
massive wait lists then they opened six
Mac Staples
and I was of course you know buying in
like all the money I had on the site and
uh
I remember kind of reviewing some of the

[29:01]
I remember kind of reviewing some of the
hands I played later that day and I was
like huh
I haven't really thought about how much
is in the pot that is so important and
then from that moment forward you know
everything yeah exactly Everything

[29:15]
everything yeah exactly Everything
Changes
um but yeah you know those aha moments
still happen obviously to lesser degrees
but you know even when you gain a fairly
deep understanding having a you know a
slight tweak is fairly meaningful but

[29:32]
slight tweak is fairly meaningful but
yeah good times back then
foreign
So eventually you did start winning I
assume before you turned pros and like
Oh I'm a losing player let's turn pro
that's usually not really the way it
works but at some point you did

[29:45]
works but at some point you did
accumulate certain knowledge uh I
believe you played online cash right
you're referring to six Max tables you
jumped in with all the rule that you had
on your site
um how did you go about improving your
game to the point you would win enough
to to be become a pro like how did that

[30:01]
to to be become a pro like how did that
learning process worked for you like you
learned that there is money in the
button that's pretty relevant what was
like the the kind of the next Journey uh
towards becoming like a winning player
in the games
so um I was learning a lot from two plus

[30:16]
so um I was learning a lot from two plus
two it was just a wealth of knowledge to
be able to access old posts from guys
who were winning at the highest Stakes
during that time frame it was a much
smaller Community back then this was
2006 I guess

[30:31]
2006 I guess
um 2006 2007 so
around that time I started posting a lot
myself when I was playing and it was
probably a dozen or two dozen guys who
were doing the same thing and we would
you know compete against each other and
it was uh you know just a very tightly

[30:46]
it was uh you know just a very tightly
knit Community although it was a public
forum and then I made certain friends we
communicated outside of the forums and a
couple guys were nice enough to sweat me
on Skype and give me some advice and uh

[31:00]
on Skype and give me some advice and uh
yeah that just kind of led to in early
ascent and and feeling like I really had
a good idea of what was going on I had a
big challenge moving up from one two to
two four like I was I was shot taking a
bit and I couldn't really ever break

[31:15]
bit and I couldn't really ever break
through and then one of my friends was
just like you just have to three bet
more and I was like
okay [ __ ] it like I'm just gonna prove
that insane and then I won like 100
vines that month but I was going way too
hard and probably it worked well because
I had the image of you know not

[31:30]
I had the image of you know not
pre-betting enough I think I just leaned
too passive in those days
um yeah that really helped that was a
big breakthrough for me
I love online poker in the best such
easy easy easy fixes to people's game

[31:45]
easy easy easy fixes to people's game
yet just three bet and bomb here we go
nowadays it's it's a little bit more
complicated usually but uh any anyone in
particular that stands out like that you
met through the forums that really had a
big impact on your career

[32:01]
big impact on your career
yeah so the guy who who mentioned this
to me was Ben Strada
um I don't know what he's up to he did
uh stick around for quite a while and
and played and succeeded I think got
fairly high stakes on Full Tilt I think
he was Swedish I'm not totally sure

[32:17]
he was Swedish I'm not totally sure
um and then I met AE Jones or Aaron
Jones
um on the forums and eventually at one
point went out to Indiana to visit him
and a number of his friends uh he was
very much a mentor to me at that time he
was winning at much higher stakes and uh

[32:31]
was winning at much higher stakes and uh
was able to give me a lot of this sort
of practical advice that I think I was
not understanding particularly well
do you remember a specific specific
thing that Aaron mentioned to you like I
said you elect certain basic
understandings that hurt your game do

[32:46]
understandings that hurt your game do
you remember a moment where Aaron said
something to you or like oh
you know like a post a post how much
money is in the pot now now AAA Jones
this is actually how it works you were
already three betting more so your game
started to develop in a positive way

[33:01]
started to develop in a positive way
yeah I think um what he did was sort of
just help me refine certain things
understand a little bit more deeply
conceptual ideas you know how to size on
certain Rivers you know even going back
to pre-flop how to construct a

[33:15]
to pre-flop how to construct a
pre-betting range a lot of these ideas
didn't really carry over into the modern
era of Poker but they worked very well
back then and I think largely that was
because people didn't agree that enough
um so three betting horse hands and
calling better ones uh just sort of you

[33:32]
calling better ones uh just sort of you
know worked out
um
yeah it was
a lot of things there's so many leaks to
plug I started applying a lot of heads
up around that time and
then eventually transitioned a bit into

[33:46]
then eventually transitioned a bit into
tournaments and uh
that was a rocky road but you know
eventually it worked out I don't think I
was really prepared for the kind of
variance that tournaments entail in my
my early Goings
yeah for a little bit of the newer

[34:01]
yeah for a little bit of the newer
school players you know when they now
get into poker they're introduced to
solver straight away but we're kind of
the learning resources available two
plus two are member as you mentioned was
very big back then and a lot of the
older school players they contribute a
lot of their success to that they were
like yeah like you said great minds they

[34:16]
like yeah like you said great minds they
were just posting in public forums free
information everywhere you know it's
very much different these days people
are way more reserved in terms of
sharing information but we're like some
other sources or were like stuff like
card Runners was that already out back

[34:30]
card Runners was that already out back
then
the card Runners came out at the time
that I was already playing and
succeeding I don't remember exactly what
year it was I want to say oh 708 maybe
maybe 2008 that sounds about right

[34:46]
maybe 2008 that sounds about right
um
yeah there were that was you know the
first uh training site that existed
beyond that it was really just
discussions with friends you know there
were very sort of limited tools to be
able to quantify different aspects of

[35:00]
able to quantify different aspects of
Poker
um so it was you know just you put your
minds together and discuss things and
see like hey I think this my intuition
says this and debate different points
and in some way it was kind of the
Romantic Era of Poker like you could

[35:15]
Romantic Era of Poker like you could
compare it with Romantic Era of Chess it
was
you know a bit more Purity to everything
now don't get me wrong I I love how the
industry has evolved but I also do have
kind of a reverence for
uh you know the times back then the good

[35:31]
uh you know the times back then the good
old days if you will yeah sometimes if I
talk to like newer school players you
know that only be playing for like three
years uh and then they said well how how
did you used to do it to say well we
don't have a solver so yeah you you
start you start like now we think like

[35:45]
start you start like now we think like
okay it's like a reverse engineering uh
path that we are now right we have the
solution then we have to figure out why
the solution is correct whereas in The
Pastels you have no solution so you
start from scratch you're like okay
let's try to figure out yeah what kind
of strategy we can build around here
that uh yeah that would actually make

[36:01]
that uh yeah that would actually make
sense and actually surprisingly a lot of
the things sure you add that as well
when you start to work with solvers a
lot of the concepts that you were
applying were actually solver approved
right maybe after a little bit of note
locking here and there that's usually

[36:15]
locking here and there that's usually
kind of where your intuition says solver
I'm not really sure any name put in some
notebooks and you're like yeah this is
what I'm talking about
um
I I kind of lost my point here but hey
yeah I definitely I definitely agree and
it was extremely gratifying to have

[36:32]
it was extremely gratifying to have
those moments of you know ideas that you
felt were very essential to Poker to be
somewhat confirmed
um and then it was also you know just as
interesting and exciting to see where
you completely missed the mark and then

[36:45]
you completely missed the mark and then
just you know be able to replace uh
worse ideas with better ones
yeah exactly I mean yeah the way I
usually see it it had is uh it has its
benefits and his downsides I think I
heard you mention this before that you

[37:01]
heard you mention this before that you
know
player players like Europe players like
me when we were already succeeding in
the past before solvers we had a certain
natural ability to figure out the game
that skill was kind of
don't want to say completely vanished

[37:15]
don't want to say completely vanished
obviously we're still I think better
than like new school players in terms of
like sort of note locking in our head
and estimating the situation of finding
the right adjustments
um
but yeah we since we have succeeded
pre-solver dissolver did kind of screw

[37:30]
pre-solver dissolver did kind of screw
rev a little bit more than other people
I guess
yeah in a sense it did but um I just
think sort of the events of technology
is inevitable and it also does move the
industry forward I'm a big believer in
that like I want to see poker continue

[37:45]
that like I want to see poker continue
to grow I want to see it evolve and I
think it would be a bit short-sighted of
me to feel in any way wronged by that
now I definitely have had those thoughts
in the past
but I think they were kind of just

[38:00]
but I think they were kind of just
short-sighted
yeah I my personal stance on like
technology and for example software in
online poker I remember there's a big
debate around the seating scripts when
they were still allowed and yeah
everyone was using them including myself

[38:15]
everyone was using them including myself
the people were having the discussion I
guess should this be there should this
not be there or people were discussing
this about huts and later about solvers
but I'm always I was always been in The
Gambia what I think about it personally
doesn't actually really matter it's like
people are using it getting an edge I'm

[38:31]
people are using it getting an edge I'm
in the same games I have to get the
every Edge that I can as well so I'm
gonna use anything that's available to
me and yeah what I actually think about
that yeah okay we can we can maybe think
about this when the time is over but
right now you know like why would I go

[38:46]
right now you know like why would I go
to quote war with someone at the table
who uses Hut and I and I'm gonna say no
I'm not into Huts why why would I give
that free Edge right
well I mean I guess the Counterpoint to
that I still do play online some one of

[39:01]
that I still do play online some one of
the sites I play on which is wsop.com
doesn't allow hugs the other site but I
put some volume in on his ACR which does
I don't use a HUD I
I don't know I've gone back and forth I

[39:15]
I don't know I've gone back and forth I
obviously have used one in the past
um I see where it's useful I find that
you need a fairly big sample sizes and I
think it's also unique to me that I have
kind of very
um sharp recall of hands

[39:31]
um sharp recall of hands
so if I play hand against someone you
know I'll likely remember it in multiple
months or years if it's significant
so I guess that's
maybe uh makes the discussion somewhat

[39:45]
maybe uh makes the discussion somewhat
moot but um
yeah I do I do believe that like it's
it's an advantage if you use it well I
found that in the past I was not able to
perform my best at the tables whilst
also taking the best out of the the
information given by the HUD or the data

[40:01]
information given by the HUD or the data
given by the HUD
yeah obviously because it's suddenly a
decision point that interferes with your
normal train of thought right it's like
oh you're just going your normal thought
process but now suddenly you have a
certain hot set that maybe tells you
something then the next thing is like

[40:16]
something then the next thing is like
okay how relevant is actually the sample
and then often more often than not
that's probably what you experience when
going back and forth off more often than
not
yeah it's just noise that kind of screws
up your natural thought process and kind
of prevents you from getting in flow

[40:30]
of prevents you from getting in flow
which in the end if you get in flow that
you will make better decisions you know
based on your intuition and you can
basically just throw a hot out of the
window I would say the majority of
people use a HUD rung uh so yeah then
then then I agree with you there but for

[40:45]
then then I agree with you there but for
example don't you use a HUD for ethical
purposes or just because it's uh yeah it
does it doesn't fit within your your
thought process yeah it's more of a
ladder I mean yeah at this point I can
see the argument for why certain Huds

[41:02]
see the argument for why certain Huds
with very Advanced features one could
argue they're unethical but again it's
an equal playing field as long as the
sites allow them and everybody has
access to it
I don't know I mean what is one to do

[41:15]
I don't know I mean what is one to do
it's like you said if your opponents are
using it and you feel like it's going to
give you an advantage
I mean you kind of take an ethical
stance and decide not to use it you are
just crossing yourself
which you know if if you do that that's

[41:30]
which you know if if you do that that's
fine but then don't take the ethical
stance and then continue to frustrate
yourself that online poker has Huts now
right that's kind of the the worst
option I would say and as I did I have
seen this quite a lot it was especially
true with seating scripts like oh I'm

[41:45]
true with seating scripts like oh I'm
against eating scripts go play on a
poker and never get a game yeah okay
maybe you know maybe maybe I have to
adjust here a little bit right because
then you live in just a world of
frustration whereas you're like listen
I'm not gonna use it I accept that I
will miss certain games and that's fine

[42:01]
will miss certain games and that's fine
then at least you know you don't live in
a constant uh yeah constant type of
frustration that seems like the the
worst idea in my opinion yeah it makes
sense I mean you at a certain point we
have to conference with what is actually

[42:15]
have to conference with what is actually
happening in reality and again we could
sort of debate whether HUD should exist
in the first place but that ship has
very much sailed and
yeah we're not on campus anymore so you
gotta do what you gotta do

[42:31]
gotta do what you gotta do
yeah I agree with that
um you so you turn pro I'm curious
usually I asked this question like what
were kind of your expectations of the
life of a professional poker player uh
how that would look starting out

[42:46]
how that would look starting out
yes like did you have certain goals
um
I did have sort of big picture goals I
didn't have a like short-term goals
um essentially the way things went for
me was I completed three semesters at

[43:02]
me was I completed three semesters at
University
I was asked you know if I was going to
pick a major and I said no I'm just
going to go ahead and do my own thing so
I left to play poker
and um

[43:16]
and um
my mother was more on the fence and uh
she said okay you know your dad thinks
it's an all right idea
um I just want you to pay me back for
the money that I contributed towards
tuition I was like you know what that's

[43:30]
tuition I was like you know what that's
completely reasonable
so I did that I maybe had like a 20K
rule or something at this point some of
the instances that I'd referenced
happened after this point where you know
sort of three betting more and learning
a bit more about the game
um so yeah I

[43:47]
um so yeah I
I apologize what was the exact question
you asked after I went kind of what do
your expectations were when you started
out playing poker right you have a
certain idea I'm turning a professional
so now my life will be in a certain way
right and then usually when we actually

[44:01]
right and then usually when we actually
turn pro I mean sometimes it's the lines
but sometimes it it doesn't align as
much as we we thought it would yeah so
I'd rather thread on two plus two from
sort of an older married guy I think you
had kids not totally sure and he

[44:15]
had kids not totally sure and he
described some of his experiences
playing pro and it seemed kind of grim
and I wasn't really that excited about
it but there was a part of me that
wasn't sure it was going to be that way
for me
um I think a lot of this comes down to
just how much you really enjoy playing

[44:31]
just how much you really enjoy playing
and for me I've just been fortunate that
I've always really enjoyed it
um so yeah that was the case here and I
didn't find it that challenging to put
in volume
um maybe a year or so maybe less than

[44:47]
um maybe a year or so maybe less than
that six months into sort of taking it
really seriously and it being my sole
Focus
um I was connected with some friends who
wanted to get a beach house in Jersey
for the summer and you know essentially

[45:00]
for the summer and you know essentially
just have a Grindhouse away from home
and that was great uh learned a lot and
really uh you know ascended up mistakes
at that time I was playing
pretty much all heads up
um mostly cash some sit and go it's a

[45:16]
um mostly cash some sit and go it's a
little bit of six Max but the heads-up
cash games were just kind of you know uh
good value at that time
well like I'm curious like you you
you're playing ring games cash then you

[45:31]
you're playing ring games cash then you
transition to hats up cash later you
will transition into tournaments What
attracted you to heads up specifically
was it just like the the money the EV
opportunity or was there something about
you know playing playing one-on-one with
someone you know you're actually beating

[45:46]
someone you know you're actually beating
one person
I think it's more just the purity of the
format to this day it is kind of I think
the best game uh it's just hard to find
people that will play and certainly
people that are you know gonna offer a

[46:01]
people that are you know gonna offer a
decent hourly
um it's just the most interesting thing
the ranges are incredibly wide of course
you're playing against the same guy
every hand yeah I don't know it just
really appealed to me
um the monetary aspect was real it's

[46:15]
um the monetary aspect was real it's
early in my career I was certainly
looking to earn
um but yeah the
the uniqueness of
of the range composition was just not
um
really like anything I'd found up to
that point
and again this is very much pre-solved

[46:32]
and again this is very much pre-solved
for error so there was a lot of
different strategies that people were
implementing and I think that you know
as we sort of touched on that ability to
take a new format and in a way make it
your own and you know test out your mind

[46:46]
your own and you know test out your mind
against others
that ended up being you know relatively
fruitful for me and for my friends but
really one friend in particular who I
work quite a bit with uh over that time

[47:00]
work quite a bit with uh over that time
frame
I remember back in the days I've got the
advice I was mainly playing like six Max
and also full ring cash and I remember
someone or multiple people did advise me
you should play like some heads up to
basically evolve your game I guess

[47:15]
basically evolve your game I guess
because like you said you're playing a
lot of wide ranges so every time you get
into a lot of spots you get a lot of
volume in compared to full ring where
you're just waiting to flop a set
basically
yeah I mean full ring especially like
Andrew it's
yeah a very Limited Format

[47:31]
yeah a very Limited Format
um
six Max yeah there's a bit more going on
certainly people played a lot looser
then so there was more action or looser
in some respects there was a lot more
plotting of openings I'll say
and yeah as up was just great fun uh I

[47:49]
and yeah as up was just great fun uh I
look back on those those days and those
memories very fondly

attracted you to the game do you also
think it was like a very pure format
yeah I think there's something special
about heads up because it's just like a
one-on-one competition it's almost like
chess where you're trying to think a few
moves ahead of your opponents there's

[50:15]
moves ahead of your opponents there's
also exploit re-exploit especially if
you get caught like a Long Heads of
battle for like four or five hours with
one opponents it almost like immerses
you it's almost like sports but you try
to compete and beat that player so yeah
there's something unique about that in
terms of what attractive made a heads up
it was a complete chance where my

[50:31]
it was a complete chance where my
friends found the Sharks score
leaderboard back in 2011 I think and
happened to be eight players who were
making over 100k and some sitting goals
so we had like a road map of what was
possible in the future so wait a second
there's a good chance there's a skill
element to this heads-up format and

[50:46]
element to this heads-up format and
there's these guys on there again that
there's such money could be the ninth
guy or tenth guy on this list that makes
good money then yeah once I got into
heads up I got hooked very quickly
probably within a month heads up was the
only interested plan but yeah I can
relate to the it's quite a unique format

[51:01]
relate to the it's quite a unique format
also I think in heads up creates unique
emotional issues because like when you
losing you're losing to this guy it's a
bit more personal and I had battles
throughout my career where there's just
months of playing the same opponents and
all of a sudden you go to bed and you
didn't used to lose money you lost to
that guy so when you wake up in the

[51:16]
that guy so when you wake up in the
morning you've got to try and beat that
guy so you try to remove that person
that Personal Touch you try to get less
detached attached to that but there is
an element of either they win or you win
and yeah I think there's an element
which makes it fun but also uh yeah
there's some challenges that come come

[51:30]
there's some challenges that come come
heads up as well all right let me tell
you the story along the lines of your
initial successes so we've got basically
uh your starting Pro and you're starting
to uh your post not two plus two you'll
get a good Network around you I think
looking at your career it seems quite

[51:45]
looking at your career it seems quite
obvious from the outside they've always
been around good people and a good
Network how much did that help you in
your initial success having the rights
kind of people around you and were you
were you consciously cultivating that or
was it just a kind of Natural Evolution
from post on tickets to and sharing your

[52:01]
from post on tickets to and sharing your
own Journey
yeah I think I got pretty lucky in the
early days that I just you know got
matched up with good people and you know
I just got along with that in the times
where I met them they wanted to spend
time and you know led to uh that that

[52:16]
time and you know led to uh that that
beach house in Jersey and then
eventually getting an apartment outside
DC uh and then you know the year after
coming to Vegas and having a lot of
success my first trip there and
eventually buying a house where I bought

[52:31]
eventually buying a house where I bought
a big house and moved in a bunch of my
friends
um so yeah that was kind of just a
snowball effect in that respect
when did you first realize that polka
was really going to work out for you
because we talked about the challenges

[52:45]
because we talked about the challenges
those first 18 months but kind of from
the outside looking in it almost seems
like your progression to playing high
stakes and being very successful was
fairly quick almost like you'll figure
out the game next thing you're living in
Vegas playing super high stakes how did
that period go and first of all when did

[53:00]
that period go and first of all when did
you first start to feel wait a second
I'm onto something with poker and
there's big opportunities here
yeah so
um I'll answer the question two ways in
a in a practical sense it was really
that time spent accuracy I went from

[53:15]
that time spent accuracy I went from
probably playing
I don't know one two two four to like
shot taking 100 200 in a matter of
months if things just went exceptionally
well we put in a ton of volume working
really hard
yeah just putting you know good Minds

[53:30]
yeah just putting you know good Minds
together Anything is Possible
um previous to that even before I'd gone
to college I remember one night I was
hanging out with some friends and
yeah I just remember leaving that

[53:45]
yeah I just remember leaving that
interaction it was nothing even really
that happened there
um but you know we sort of went our own
ways and then I was like hey I'm just
gonna like go play poker tonight like
why not I you know hit up some other
friends and went to their game and just
while I was on the way there I kind of

[54:00]
while I was on the way there I kind of
just realized like this is what I want
to do with the rest of my life and it
was just very clear and I had just like
a confidence that I don't really know
that I had felt about
anything else in my life at that point
and certainly not to that degree

[54:15]
and certainly not to that degree
um so yeah it was
a big Catalyst for me to just you know
take it seriously just having this sort
of emotional excitement about about the
game
um and yeah obviously you have all the
experiences to follow
um yeah I think sometimes when you just

[54:31]
um yeah I think sometimes when you just
put your head down and get immersed and
something everything that happens after
that is almost wouldn't say irrelevant
but just happens almost organically and
for you being obsessed with poker you
are sharing your life story on typical
civil Arts other players were doing the
same this just led to more situations

[54:46]
same this just led to more situations
that unfolded because you were immersing
yourself in that pocket Journey then
once you've pulled into pause but not
like for seconds and you look around
you're like oh wait a second we've come
pretty far here this is pretty a pretty
cool story that we live in yeah I
watched them that the high stakes live
in with I think it's you Tony Dunst and

[55:01]
in with I think it's you Tony Dunst and
Dan Smith in Vegas I think you're
probably around 23 I think the time
start was 12 years ago uh but yeah I
just want to talk about that period
because looking at that house it reminds
me of like University ideas for myself
but obviously none of the baller stuff
you guys live in a really nice pads in

[55:15]
you guys live in a really nice pads in
Vegas and you're all playing really high
stakes poker but the house looks a bit
like chaotic so to speak there's a lot
of like beer pong tables there's all
sorts of fun you tell you can tell you
guys you're having a great time I want
to know like what were some of the
challenges of being in that environment
so the way I could see it this a few of

[55:30]
so the way I could see it this a few of
you maybe three to five of you living in
this one house your grinding super high
stakes poker but you're also living a
very fun lifestyle having parties doing
lots of fun stuff so what was life what
was life like back then and what were
some of the kind of challenges of being
in that environment
yeah great question so my first summer

[55:47]
yeah great question so my first summer
in Vegas
I had very uh profound success of the
World Series I've played 10 events
cashed in five
um made a final table got second and
then got 18th in the main event

[56:02]
then got 18th in the main event
um so I was like wow this is incredible
the following year I definitely let
hubris get the best of me and I decided
like okay I'm young I'm not rich but
like I'm doing pretty well and uh you

[56:16]
like I'm doing pretty well and uh you
know I'm just gonna party and I think in
many ways I was over compensating
because
I didn't really have this sort of you
know crappy popular experience in high
school and then in college you know it

[56:30]
school and then in college you know it
was cut short by my interest in poker
and my social life was fairly lacking so
I think I was making up for a lost time
in that respect
long story short I decided that I would
just basically drink every day over the
summer and it was fun because I'm
friendly and I have a lot of people at

[56:46]
friendly and I have a lot of people at
various tables I was playing uh at the
World Series but that I knew
um but it resulted in me playing like I
don't know 22 or 23 events and cashing
in one of them so pretty stark contrast
to the previous year and it kind of made
me realize Hmm this is probably not

[57:01]
me realize Hmm this is probably not
going to work out
um so yeah I started taking things more
seriously and accepted my faith that
like you know the same hard work I had
to put in in the early goings or the
same hard work I had to put in to
achieve something is the same hard work

[57:15]
achieve something is the same hard work
I'm going to have to you know continue
to put in the discipline I need to
sustain that thing
yeah I think it's an interesting kind of
evolution to go through where you're
having fun having a great time but then
almost like reality kicks in and you
almost like wait a second maybe I need

[57:30]
almost like wait a second maybe I need
to reevaluate how I'm approaching things
and you can tell for you guys all living
in the house you have an awesome awesome
time but the same time Poco was also
evolving to get a little bit more
challenging and at least you could see
uh you guys would probably have to
upgrade to your approaches to podcasts
who have like long-term success and when

[57:45]
who have like long-term success and when
did when did you realize that it wasn't
going to be all fun because myself like
when I got into poker I flew to Thailand
with some friends and we literally
created a Grindhouse away from
distractions and we actually made it
like a very strict Zone we were doing
like really strict sleep patterns eating
really clean and we just did this

[58:00]
really clean and we just did this
because we thought right let's make
let's rig everything in our favor so we
have a chance of success there was
another group of poker players in
Thailand who had a house similar to
yours and they was playing beer pong
partying all the time we want to cover
these guys play poker in this
environment this is this is we couldn't
do it so for yourself like obviously

[58:15]
do it so for yourself like obviously
you're living kind of you've lived both
lives when was the moment or when was
the kind of shift for you when you
thought actually maybe live in this kind
of party lifestyle to maybe compensate
for not having that time of college when
did you kind of transition out of that
period
well it was not too long after the

[58:31]
well it was not too long after the
aforementioned World Series experience
where Black Friday happened and I was
like okay this is a game changer
um I you know all myself and all my
friends felt like you know the sky is
falling didn't really know what to do

[58:47]
falling didn't really know what to do
um eventually made the decision to move
to Toronto for a period of time with
some of my other friends
and uh you know there was just a sort of
another very clear indication that this
is something that you know it's gonna
have to be taken really seriously now

[59:01]
have to be taken really seriously now
traveling outside the country to pursue
it
um you know the easy money was largely
gone at that point
um it it really is the cliche like you
don't know what you have until it's gone
like looking back I mean it was just

[59:16]
like looking back I mean it was just
insane but yeah that very much showed me
um you know it's not always going to
exist this way and in many ways that was
good
um I needed to kind of learn that lesson

[59:30]
um I needed to kind of learn that lesson
it certainly came very swiftly but yeah
it was it was ultimately for the best
yeah how challenging was it for you to
reinvent yourself when you had the
realization that poker is going to get
more challenging going forwards because
you can imagine a lot of players in your

[59:46]
you can imagine a lot of players in your
same situation were almost like all
right the phone's over let's do
something else the the good times are
done now whereas you instantly went oh
lesson to be learned that's a reapproach
program with different lens how
challenging was that to uh almost like
re because you've had a success this

[1:00:01]
re because you've had a success this
playing things are going really well
being quite easy so to speak and now we
have to go back into poker it's gonna be
challenging so uh yeah how hard was that
period
yeah it was tough
um not gonna lie I also had this

[1:00:15]
um not gonna lie I also had this
experience where you know I descended so
quickly
um the ranks of heads up and
I was
somewhat of a Top Dog in that field in
that era
and then

[1:00:30]
and then
you know I had a bunch of money tied up
in Black Friday uh I you know it wasn't
doing particularly well in live
tournaments
um I just had you know some monetary
issues and I was
playing with like too much ego kind of

[1:00:47]
playing with like too much ego kind of
feeling like I deserved it more than I
really did
um so I had to sort of come to terms
with a lot of that stuff in myself I
think in certain ways that
maybe not in a direct sense but
indirectly led me towards spirituality

[1:01:01]
indirectly led me towards spirituality
and self-realization a bit
amazing yeah we'll go deeper into uh
your spiritual Pursuits as the
conversation goes but for now I want to
take the conversation to more of a dark
place and I want to look at your Rock
Bottom moments and I have three of them
that you mentioned in the questionnaire

[1:01:16]
that you mentioned in the questionnaire
that we sent you that I want to look at
them and don't say go back to that
moment in time and the lesson that
you've learned from it so think of
yourself your evolution is quite clear
that you're someone who learns a lot of
lessons from things going badly in
particular and you can reinvent yourself
so uh I'm gonna go through the three
kind of rock bottom moments and we can

[1:01:31]
kind of rock bottom moments and we can
just basically hopefully hear more some
lessons that you've learned from each of
them so the first one was playing big
cash games and having huge losses and
feeling completely lifeless so first of
all take us back to that period and what
was the lessons you had to learn
throughout that

[1:01:45]
throughout that
I mean I think the the biggest lesson in
hindsight was just you know have more
reasonable bankroll management
uh
yeah just you know when things are going
so well much like we were just
discussing it's easy to think they'll
just continue to go very well and then

[1:02:01]
just continue to go very well and then
as you pointed out reality will
sometimes set in and yeah I mean it it
sets in quickly and it doesn't feel good
when you lose big amounts
um yeah I had some

[1:02:15]
um yeah I had some
obscene losing days in hindsight and it
wasn't obscene for those games but just
you know monetarily
um and then I had some you know
incredibly winning days and the Elation
is is great there too and I'll just
mention that I I would like to think I

[1:02:31]
mention that I I would like to think I
learned some good experiences too it's
you know uh much more productive but it
does require a certain amount of wisdom
and I think these days when I feel like
extremely euphoric I appreciate that and
I also take it as a sign that I might

[1:02:46]
I also take it as a sign that I might
not be in the clearest Minds to make
decisions because
yeah it's just a you know it's an
inflated state of happiness and it's not
going to to last to that degree

[1:03:00]
going to to last to that degree
um
yeah sorry did I answer the question
there yeah yeah you did yeah I think
it's important to learn from both the
goods and the bad experiences sometimes
the bites or the challenging experiences
are easier to learn from because they
have such a heightened emotion and a
problem that we want to fix we don't

[1:03:16]
problem that we want to fix we don't
want to be in this situation again
therefore mind's going to overdrive to
try to fix that so for you it was a
simple lesson but a valuable one in
terms of bankroll management don't play
these crazy games it's going to lead to
these this kind of variants and yeah I
don't want to put myself in this

[1:03:30]
don't want to put myself in this
situation many times going forwards all
right the second moment I want to go
back to was going deep in big live
entities and torching of stacks what was
about that period that was a lesson you
need to learn and take us back to that
period
yeah

[1:03:45]
yeah
um
I was probably even in you know whenever
it was that I wrote that too hard on
myself yeah I mean it's easy to say in
hindsight that the stocks were torched
often and sometimes in some cases they
certainly were not played optimally um

[1:04:00]
certainly were not played optimally um
but I think this was one of the
challenges I faced moving from cash
games to mtts like it was double-edged
it worked in the sense that I was able
to build up big stacks and play very
fearlessly and I think at the same time
I didn't really
um

[1:04:15]
um
appropriately appreciate the differences
at stages of tournaments where you want
to take risks or
um you know how certain ICM components
play into decision making
um and probably to some degree how you

[1:04:30]
um and probably to some degree how you
know you should play against certain
players
um so yeah it was
um yeah this deep learning curve in that
respect
and the final one was a very specific
event where you bubble the 25k the

[1:04:46]
event where you bubble the 25k the
Bellagio WPT on day four and the reason
this hurts so much is you went against
your intuition and you were losing giant
pots so take us back to that tournament
and what did that teach you
yeah
um well for starters I just made kind of

[1:05:02]
um well for starters I just made kind of
a a really bad play pre-pop where it was
like four-way Limbs and I just completed
the small line with 10 3 off I guess up
to that point I had just never learned
like hey you shouldn't complete these
hands multi-way like it's not a good
idea the board came time high and uh one

[1:05:17]
idea the board came time high and uh one
of the players who had overlapped that
three streets and it was not I remember
the exact board it was like 10 7 deuce
Deuce four maybe something like that you

[1:05:31]
Deuce four maybe something like that you
just at that shoved we were like maybe
25 lines effective
um but it's just not a spot where
players in that era would find a ton of
Bluffs
um there's only so many kind of natural
Bluffs at least I think for how people

[1:05:46]
Bluffs at least I think for how people
used to play but it was against a sort
of more creative player
um and yeah I think I you know as far as
my intuition goes
if I'm recalling correctly I just sort
of knew I was dead and I just sort of

[1:06:00]
of knew I was dead and I just sort of
talked myself into it because I had top
pair and it's just kind of a dumb
yeah it was just a bad moment
um I remember that tournament quite
vividly
um my friend ended up winning and I was
quite happy for him but I really don't
think I played that well and I think

[1:06:16]
think I played that well and I think
I don't remember exactly when that was
but
it was definitely within that time frame
of transition and turning points for me
and I can pick out you know certain
instances over my career where
certain things are happening with my

[1:06:31]
certain things are happening with my
understanding of the game and
I'm just not playing my a plus plus and
I feel like when I have had my best
results I am uh so yeah this was
certainly in this bar was not
so going against your intuition how does

[1:06:46]
so going against your intuition how does
that feel for you because I can picture
yourself being someone who trusts
yourself to go with your own judgments
and I guess that's quite painful when
you don't allow yourself to to go with
that intuitive feeling like when you
speak on other podcasts and interviews
about having some like self-sabotaging
traits and windows tilts any of these

[1:07:02]
traits and windows tilts any of these
did any of these play into that and when
you go against your intuition what do
you feel
is the error there right because we
could say at a certain times where we
might not want to go with that intuition
why do you feel like in that moment or
in other moments

[1:07:15]
in other moments
um it's painful for you not to trust
your intuition
I guess on a fundamental level I believe
that you know you have to trust yourself
to succeed in a highly competitive sport
or industry like poker
um so

[1:07:30]
um so
yes there's a logical element and I
think that uh they they work in tandem I
don't think it's you know this or that I
think it's this and that
[Music]
um
as far as why it hurts so much when you

[1:07:45]
as far as why it hurts so much when you
go against it
well it's sort of like you know the
answer and then you do the other thing
because you convince yourself otherwise
I will say that I think you have to be
at your best for your intuition to to
really be sharp and to be worth trusting
and there's certainly moments where I

[1:08:01]
and there's certainly moments where I
can acknowledge like maybe it's 30
minutes before dinner break and I'm kind
of hungry I just feel like hey I'm not
at my best right now
and I might give up some true value by
not trusting myself as much but it's
just sort of the safer way out and I

[1:08:15]
just sort of the safer way out and I
don't like to play poker like that over
the long run but there are is a time and
a place for certain things
yeah I think that's an important thing
to touch on that you almost need to find
tune your intuition and you need to be
aware when it's maybe not a good idea to
fully go with your kind of reads in the

[1:08:31]
fully go with your kind of reads in the
moment based on what the fact is so for
yourself is there anything that you do
in your warm-up goal in-game to ensure
that your intuition is sharp for those
games like you mentioned like when
you're hungry or towards the
intercession is there any other kind of
guardrails you create for yourself when

[1:08:45]
guardrails you create for yourself when
you go right it's actually not a good
idea to push Mike and exploits in this
moment
um so something I like to do before I
play book race just play like speed
chess I think it just sort of gets your
mind going and making quick decisions
and thinking on the Fly

[1:09:02]
and thinking on the Fly
um
but other than that I think just being
well rested is is really important for
me being well fed
um having done some degree of physical
exercise so that I feel comfortable
sitting for long periods I find that to

[1:09:16]
sitting for long periods I find that to
be
um fairly helpful although not
necessarily day of I found that doing
exercise too intense in the morning
before sessions leads to me fatiguing
more quickly
um so yeah I just like to keep it simple
with that stuff I think discipline is

[1:09:32]
with that stuff I think discipline is
good but for me having too much of a
disciplined routine I found that that
doesn't really work as well
yeah it's almost just doing the things
that make you feel good and you feel
shocked you feel ready to execute your

[1:09:45]
shocked you feel ready to execute your
strategy and yeah that's kind of your
own personal routine of things and turn
off yourself you've mentioned having a
bit of flexibility is important but the
players do well like run it with a bit
more structure yeah finding ways to feel
good when you play It's kind of the the
summary of the above it all all right so

[1:10:00]
summary of the above it all all right so
I went out to the conversation to your
reinvention or the shift to spirituality
and when that started to play a more
important role in your life so I think
that kind of where to segue into this is
you mentioned polka was no longer a
villain or as fulfilling at that time I
think you started getting more into yoga

[1:10:16]
think you started getting more into yoga
and meditation in particular so talk us
through like what time periods that was
and what was going on with polka that
led you to uh to want to go for this
shift
yeah so this was post Black Friday I'd
been traveling back and forth between uh
Vegas and Toronto

[1:10:31]
Vegas and Toronto
and I wasn't really loving the the live
cash game experience I hadn't like fully
transitioned into live tournament until
I was still playing I guess I just kind
of felt a bit uncertain about my life at

[1:10:46]
of felt a bit uncertain about my life at
this point I had moved out to Vegas I
left my friends and family behind in New
York and
yeah I just felt like I needed to kind
of take time to more deeply understand
myself my life where I was Society
reality

[1:11:01]
reality
um yeah and that was
you know kind of the beginning of it
um let's see
I started watching various YouTube
videos ramdas was someone who I uh you

[1:11:15]
videos ramdas was someone who I uh you
know came to really appreciate the
messaging from
I started reading the Carlos Castaneda
books not sure if you're familiar with
those those were quite interesting and
uh yeah it got fairly into psychedelics
for a little while and opened my mind

[1:11:31]
for a little while and opened my mind
opened my heart and uh yeah just had
some new experiences that
just helped me kind of better place
myself within the world and have uh
yeah just a better idea of

[1:11:48]
yeah just a better idea of
uh you know I guess
what I was doing and and with my purpose
and uh everything just made more sense
and I've kind of been able to take that

[1:12:01]
and I've kind of been able to take that
forward with me since then
yeah I think spirituality can be quite a
broad kind of concept for a lot of
people but to me it generally means like
a connection with something greater than
yourself and trying to seek meaning and
some sort of purpose to what you're
doing and your existence so to speak and

[1:12:16]
doing and your existence so to speak and
it can take you many directions and
where you're going to go with it for you
I know it's been a very um eventful kind
of Journey I'd like to know what you
define as spiritual Spirit spirituality
put yourself and what falls under that
and how it's been helpful for poker and
life when you're being on this

[1:12:30]
life when you're being on this
exploration
yeah I like your definition just a
connection to something greater than
yourself
um in this case you start to get into
sort of the issue of definitions
um whether you want to call it God or
the universe or life just all that is

[1:12:46]
the universe or life just all that is
essentially having some kind of
relationship with everything
is you know has been integral for me as
far as how it affects poker I think I
see poker somewhat differently than

[1:13:00]
see poker somewhat differently than
probably a lot of my peers where I see
it you know kind of in
um in context of everything else
and although that doesn't necessarily
have a direct reflection on strategy I

[1:13:15]
have a direct reflection on strategy I
think it helps me
uh keep going when times get tough and
yeah I don't know I just like to see
things holistically it just feels more
correct I suppose or it feels better
let's say would you say it helps you to

[1:13:30]
let's say would you say it helps you to
touch more from poker in terms of the
specific meanings you give to uh winning
losing do you feel like you can see it
from a more zoomed out perspective that
allows you to uh not take things so
seriously in the short term
I definitely think it helps with losing
I don't really get upset uh much from

[1:13:48]
I don't really get upset uh much from
losing I'm
yet I've gotten a lot better at you know
if I play a hand poorly especially just
kind of letting it roll off my back
um and then as far as wins go just you
know being appreciative being grateful

[1:14:01]
know being appreciative being grateful
understanding that this is not something
that's going to happen every time you
play and yeah just taking it for what it
is and just being truly happy when when
they occur
um yeah I think one of the challenges

[1:14:15]
um yeah I think one of the challenges
for poker players is when they start to
realize that wait a second there might
be more to life than this game of poker
and there might be more meaner to it and
then poker can see him almost at odds
with that it can almost seem like
poker's pulling in one way here and then
you're trying to pull away to get more
kind of clarity of what kind of your

[1:14:30]
kind of clarity of what kind of your
real purpose in life is so for you I
know you've spent some time in India um
curious to know like when you're going
into this realm how you were able to uh
kind of combine poker did you take a
break from poker for a while to kind of
almost like find what you wanted to do
with life and then come back to poker
with a new perspective or will you kind

[1:14:46]
with a new perspective or will you kind
of Juggle them both simultaneously
I was definitely juggling them in
hindsight I'm not sure how wise that was
although I did have a lot of success
over the course of this time frame
um

[1:15:00]
um
yeah it was a very interesting phase of
my life uh it sort of culminated in
me having a little bit less interest in
poker for a period of time
but that was in large part because I had
sort of influences in my life which were

[1:15:16]
sort of influences in my life which were
not
um in my best interest let's say
uh it would be interesting to see that
phase would have played out if I had
um you know just stuck around the people
who were integral to my initial Ascent

[1:15:30]
who were integral to my initial Ascent
more so
[Music]
um
yeah
I don't think the spirituality itself or
that new understanding or frame of
reference for for life let's say uh was
was so much a deterrent I think in many

[1:15:46]
was so much a deterrent I think in many
ways that actually encouraged me because
it gave uh
you know new meaning and understanding
uh to life and to Poker within that
so what was some of those new meanings
on those dominance that you came to what

[1:16:00]
on those dominance that you came to what
was some of the the mindset ships when
you started to uh sing poke in a
different context what are some of the
the main things you you noticed
yeah so I think being able to kind of
clarify you know what intuition was and
you know
having maybe ways to define or

[1:16:17]
having maybe ways to define or
categorize things that were happening to
me already
but sort of just felt like one-off
instances or or foreign events and I
didn't really understand them so that
was pretty exciting
um also having gotten it more into

[1:16:31]
um also having gotten it more into
breath work generally and understanding
you know the human body getting more
into yoga understanding uh you know what
being Physically Active I I was pretty
lethargic through
um

[1:16:45]
um
I guess most of my life up to that point
so seeing how exercise
raising your heart rate all that stuff
affected my play and
um yeah that was all very interesting I
think that was in large part you know
what made poker pretty exciting with

[1:17:01]
what made poker pretty exciting with
those new understandings
so you mentioned three things which can
all go together yoga meditation and
breathing I'm curious to know when you
first started experimenting with these
practices what were some of the kind of
changes you noticed I know you mentioned

[1:17:15]
changes you noticed I know you mentioned
you feel launching with your body and
yeah I'd be interested to know how
that's played out in terms of your
performance and I'd love to know what
you're currently doing in terms of your
current practices around all yoga
meditation and breathing
yeah so uh it helped a lot I did you

[1:17:31]
yeah so uh it helped a lot I did you
know go on a pretty profound theater
during that time frame
full disclosure I was smoking a lot of
weed during that time and it also I
think was helping me kind of with where
I was at I eventually came to realize

[1:17:46]
I was at I eventually came to realize
that it wasn't sustainable and uh
you know I guess this probably
contributed to you know a little bit of
the loss of interest in poker where I
had to you know reinvent myself in a way

[1:18:02]
had to you know reinvent myself in a way
because I got so used to playing in that
elevated State and then when I played
without it I kind of felt like I was
missing a little bit of that spice or
that essence
um so that was that was tricky and

[1:18:16]
um so that was that was tricky and
yeah learning uh how to play in a sober
mind again uh it did take some time for
me to readjust it wasn't like I really
forgot ideas but there's just a certain
creativity that was lacking and I knew

[1:18:32]
creativity that was lacking and I knew
that it was possible to to have that uh
in this you know normal waking state but
to go search it out and find it and be
able to to bring it into my Clyde it did
take some time
um as far as what I do now

[1:18:45]
um as far as what I do now
yeah I mean I have certain breathing
techniques that I guess I've just
learned a lot over the years I don't
really like I mentioned I don't really
have much rigidity
um the only thing that I'm pretty
disciplined about is

[1:19:00]
disciplined about is
um if I'm gonna apply and ideally most
days although my sleep's been a bit
chaotic for a number of reasons lately
traveling and such
um I like to meditate for at least 10
more minutes 10 minutes when I get up in
the morning and I find that just sort of
sets me on the right path for the day

[1:19:15]
sets me on the right path for the day
beyond that sometimes I'll do some
breathing whether before I apply or at
the table or on breaks
um but yeah just being light and relaxed
is honestly I think the most important
thing just to not overthink things to

[1:19:30]
thing just to not overthink things to
not take things too seriously and just
to be at ease if I can be at ease I
think I can play my best
yeah it sounds like it's all kind of
come together in terms of you feeling
more relaxed like I said more at ease
playing poker and you've had to
re-evaluate and reinvent how you've

[1:19:46]
re-evaluate and reinvent how you've
shown up as a poker player and at first
like there's been challenges I think
when you remove something that you're
doing habitually whether it's smoking
weed whether it's taking coffee
something that creates an elevated State
when you remove that in the short term
there's often a adjustment basis where

[1:20:00]
there's often a adjustment basis where
it feels like oh I've actually gone
backwards in this area and I need to
recalibrate and a lot of people in that
state will go back to the old habits
because they feel like it just doesn't
work sounds like for you you were able
to kind of stick with it say like the
long term 10 benefits of being able to
perform in a unaltered stable coalets

[1:20:16]
perform in a unaltered stable coalets
and it sounds like meditation yoga
breath work allowed you to get launching
with your body I'm sure that's helped
with your intuition game as well which
has been helpful for you so I'd like to
know now about your psychedelic
experiences so I think obviously
meditation you'll get breathe in very

[1:20:30]
meditation you'll get breathe in very
safe for anyone to get involved in those
activities and they'll see benefits
almost instantly psychedelics I always
think need to be taken caution and with
the right intention behind it so
yourself first of all what were your
early psychedelic experiences and what
was the intention behind behind those

[1:20:47]
was the intention behind behind those
yeah I completely agree with everything
he said
um I think having attention is his
integral and sort of understanding that
you know it is a powerful substance
um whatever you're taking uh you want to

[1:21:00]
um whatever you're taking uh you want to
know what you're getting yourself into
to some degree so previous to having had
any experiences I read a lot of trip
reports on Arrowood and talked to
friends of mine who had had experiences
um I was still pretty hesitant and the
first time I had
uh it's very small dose of mushrooms was

[1:21:16]
uh it's very small dose of mushrooms was
basically right after Black Friday went
over a friend's house and just sort of
felt the the Rumblings of an experience
uh what it would be what would be
essentially the precursor of one I was

[1:21:30]
essentially the precursor of one I was
like okay that's not that intimidating
and had a couple more kind of
experiences like that uh I would say
from this phase of My Life One
experience really sticks out where I
went to the mountains with my brother
and uh some friends of mine a couple

[1:21:46]
and uh some friends of mine a couple
people who were living with me during
that time period
and took a fairly large dose and my take
away from that whole experience was
essentially just uh
feeling like I had remembered that I'm

[1:22:01]
feeling like I had remembered that I'm
God lost in my own experience and what
it did for me was remove any sort of
victim mentality
um remove kind of any
feelings of lack or

[1:22:15]
feelings of lack or
um how to say
anything that happened to me I just felt
like okay well if I'm everything then
this is part of my experience that I
need to integrate on some level and
again it just sort of you know furthered
that very cohesive holistic view on life

[1:22:32]
that very cohesive holistic view on life
and reality
so that was huge for me and yeah again
to this day still is
um I'm very grateful that I have that
experience
yeah I think you can tell from the way

[1:22:45]
yeah I think you can tell from the way
you tell that story that it's had a long
lasting change on you and you had a
glimpse of almost like a connection with
uh let's say a larger self or greater
meaning and then that stuck with you for
a long time I think with psychedelics
when I hear people speak about them it
can go into ways one it can be like a

[1:23:00]
can go into ways one it can be like a
state at your head and then you go back
to your normal living and you want to
get back to that state like some people
use psychedelics as almost an escape
from their reality to get to this kind
of heightened state of being so to speak
and they'll keep going back to it and
you'll see this with people who were
going psychedelic Retreats three or four
times a year always trying to get back

[1:23:16]
times a year always trying to get back
to that end stage then you get other
people who will have a psychedelic
experience just once or twice or maybe
three times and that has a profound
impact on how they see the world how
they change and I find very interesting
when people are able to integrate a
one-off experience like that and have a
greater kind of purpose or meaning to

[1:23:30]
greater kind of purpose or meaning to
their life long term it sounds like for
you that's been the case so from there
I'm curious to know how to change things
and so you've had this experience with
psychedelics you realized your God so to
speak or you're connected to a larger
meaning than you thought you were how
did that impact you day-to-day in terms

[1:23:45]
did that impact you day-to-day in terms
of showing up in life
well
um it definitely made me reevaluate you
know to go back to the beginning of the
discussion the beliefs I had
um just generally about myself about
others if you see everyone as a part of

[1:24:01]
others if you see everyone as a part of
yourself as a part of one whole
uh you know judgment becomes pretty
superficial a lot of things do
um and again that was you know a large
part of why I then Dove deeper into

[1:24:15]
part of why I then Dove deeper into
spirituality self exploration
self-realization wanting just to have
you know deeper greater understanding
um I became much less interested in
TV movies pop culture

[1:24:30]
TV movies pop culture
I just kind of wanted to retreat and you
know go within in many ways so that I
could
you know just take the time to I guess
listen to myself or
yeah just get in touch with myself

[1:24:46]
yeah just get in touch with myself
so they're that kind of predated a
roughly two-year phase where I was
somewhat Off the Grid I mean I was still
in Vegas but
um was living
uh fairly

[1:25:01]
uh fairly
anti-social I guess ascetic somewhat
lifestyle
must be an interest in life to live when
you're in Vegas which is quite external
dominated world but you're running in a
Pursuit during those those years where
most people are seeing the big lights

[1:25:16]
most people are seeing the big lights
and the big casinos and they live in a
very outcome-based life and for you it
sounds like during that period you were
starting to feel your connection to
everything else and you were going
internal and seeking more and more kind
of connection to that states but you're
living an environment which most people

[1:25:30]
living an environment which most people
are guests around you we're not on an
equally spiritual Pursuits and that's
what I love about like the personal
Journey it doesn't matter at all where
you are in Life or what environment
you're in you can be on your own Journey
throughout that and the inner journey is
always available see that sounds like
for you that kind of connection to the

[1:25:45]
for you that kind of connection to the
whole has had a big impact and I'm
curious to know like how that's impacted
like how you set goals and how you move
going forward because if we think let's
say I had a belief that I'm separate and
I need to validate myself and everything
I do is a kind of stamp of on me me me

[1:26:00]
I do is a kind of stamp of on me me me
and a very personal identity that's
going to impact a lot of my decisions
from that kind of belief system on the
flip side I believe I'm part of the
whole and everything's integrated and
almost everything's connected in
somewhere that's going to change my way
of going through life day to day so for
you in terms of playing poker obviously

[1:26:16]
you in terms of playing poker obviously
we can we can classes as you're an
individual playing poker but if you're
seeing a bigger kind of meaning to this
I'm interested to know how that maybe
changed your your goals your Pursuits
within poker until you have to
reevaluate the book episode with a fresh
lens

[1:26:30]
lens
yeah I think I probably reevaluated it
uh in a variety of ways and I know that
I don't remember exactly what it was but
I I really had to come to terms with the
fact that in order for me to benefit
other people had to lose I think that
was somewhat of a challenge for me

[1:26:47]
was somewhat of a challenge for me
um
as far as other day-to-day things I
think more so it just changed my I was I
was obviously engaged in different
activities I think more so it just
changed my perspective uh than a lot of

[1:27:01]
changed my perspective uh than a lot of
my my actions
yeah that's a good question
we'll go I'll go with that so would you
say your perspectives haven't impacted
your actions directly because I would
say like once perspective changes either

[1:27:16]
say like once perspective changes either
two things can happen either you do the
same things but it's it it's different
it's almost like you're gonna need
wisdom and your relationship to what's
happening is different all that New
Perspective allows you to take a
different course it's like one or two
because it's almost like yo hit a high
advantage point on the mountain you can

[1:27:30]
advantage point on the mountain you can
see more things going on so you get to
choose different routes or you get to uh
be more comfortable with where you're at
so for you do you feel like it was more
the latter in terms of
actions didn't change much because Felts
um more of these with them
I think so because I was still flying a

[1:27:45]
I think so because I was still flying a
decent bit of Poker so like I wasn't you
know purely removed from society and I
was getting a decent amount of social
interaction through just being at the
table with people that I you know had
developed friendships uh with over the
years
um

[1:28:01]
yeah I got a lot of the partying out of
my system when I was younger so yeah I
think I think I think it is the
yeah how did the things around you
change when you all kind of
self-knowledge on your inner Journey was
unfolding did you feel like

[1:28:16]
unfolding did you feel like
circumstances around you would change in
terms of success you have in things
coming easier or was it the opposite was
things well things challenging during
that period when you were Reinventing
yourself
yeah it went both ways um I was as I
mentioned I went on quite a nice heater

[1:28:31]
mentioned I went on quite a nice heater
in poker but I also found myself
uh you know not spending as much time
with the people who definitely had my
best interests in mind and just kind of
exposing myself to uh you know different
people different communities and that's
always been something that I enjoy I

[1:28:46]
always been something that I enjoy I
love meeting new people
um I just think it's so interesting how
different everybody is and I love that
about life but at the same time if you
get too close to some people you can get
burnt when you think oh ever like you

[1:29:01]
burnt when you think oh ever like you
can't obviously as a poker player treat
everyone you beat like friends you've
had in this industry uh you know for the
better part of a decade or longer than
that so that was a bit of a wake-up call
for me in certain cases but

[1:29:15]
for me in certain cases but
yeah
um
I I think that's a
that's a good answer yeah I think for
yourself obviously you shared a lot of
your journey I think a lot of the people
around the same time as you were very
open on two plus two sharing being very

[1:29:31]
open on two plus two sharing being very
trusting you guys were meeting up with
each other creating friendship networks
and the text and elements of trust in
people and they're kind of curiosity to
learn and meet new people that sometimes
obviously you'll meet the wrong type of
people or you'll put that trust in the
wrong people but you have to learn that

[1:29:45]
wrong people but you have to learn that
the hard way so to speak almost like get
burnt a few times to kind of recalibrate
that but I do think overall it's a
really uh good good trait because it
allows you to uh be authentic to
yourself you generally attract
like-minded people for the most part who
hopefully have your interests at heart
at least once you filter out some of the

[1:30:01]
at least once you filter out some of the
kind of bad eggs so to speak you
generally have a very good Core group
that can relate to you because you're
authentic with them and they're
authentic with you so I think overall
it's a definitely a good skill yeah
sometimes you've got to recalibrate that
in terms of yeah who you like to your

[1:30:15]
in terms of yeah who you like to your
circle as as things progress yeah I
completely agree with you I I would
never want to change in such way that I
you know left this part of myself behind
but it is just you know sort of learning
skill refining it honing it
understanding how to better utilize it

[1:30:31]
understanding how to better utilize it
so that you enrich your experience uh in
life
ready for yourself your inner Journey as
you've been evolving as a poker player
do you feel like you've had to reinvent
yourself as you've kind of grown more
knowledge and grown more wisdom into

[1:30:45]
knowledge and grown more wisdom into
your maybe larger episodes
yeah yeah constantly every year
um I mean it's uh it's ever going going
process right you don't know what you
don't know so every time with the
knowledge that you have you feel like
you've prevented yourself but then a

[1:31:01]
you've prevented yourself but then a
year later you will have different
knowledge so you will reinvent yourself
again right it's all it's all
perspective and I think I went through
various phases in my life where uh yeah
where I had to reinvent myself I think
also I usually like to

[1:31:17]
also I usually like to
step out of my comfort zone try
different things and with that usually
comes different experiences different
emotions and since I'm quite aware of
what's going on and I reflect on those
emotions and I reflect on certain
thoughts that I have a certain behavior

[1:31:31]
thoughts that I have a certain behavior
that I show I yeah I'm generally just
curious about myself where that then
comes from and every time when you put
yourself in a different situation and
you're observative of yourself you will
get to know yourself a little bit better
so yeah this is a this is a constant

[1:31:45]
so yeah this is a this is a constant
journey in poker out of Poker and I
don't think it will ever stop it's not
like at some point I'm like yeah you
know
now I got it figured out because every
time when when you change your situation
other things will come up for example uh

[1:32:00]
other things will come up for example uh
I remember when I started for example
twitching and how I already figured like
okay I'm gonna you know put myself a
quite a vulnerable position right you're
you're you're basically opening up your
game to get roasted by the whole world
by the internet so I already figured

[1:32:15]
by the internet so I already figured
like okay if I'm gonna do something most
likely certain emotions will come up but
I remember in early sessions like ego
straight away came up like people were
making comments and I I had I felt like
a natural yeah I don't know like the ego
wanted to say like uh oh yeah of course

[1:32:31]
wanted to say like uh oh yeah of course
I can take down that guy I can take down
that guy and I kind of already knew this
this could happen so I spotted it
straight away and a lot of things like I
remember the first couple of twitch
sessions reflecting on it's like what
did I just do then I would look it back

[1:32:45]
did I just do then I would look it back
it's like oh where did this come from
but I find that quite experienced right
people might often then shy away from
doing in this exam twitch for that
reason but I actually think the opposite
is probably true you should just go do
it and then yeah and then use that
information you feel a little bit

[1:33:00]
information you feel a little bit
uncomfortable or you would do some weird
stuff uh but yeah then by putting
yourself in that experience you can yeah
you can find out why that was and and
try to grow
finger yeah I think it's just a random
example of uh of that I'm curious based

[1:33:16]
example of uh of that I'm curious based
on uh what you guys were talking about
uh Chewie what are in your opinion what
are your European signs that players are
ignoring their spiritual side like what
are some common struggles that you think

[1:33:31]
are some common struggles that you think
spirituality could help uh players
evolve or be relieved from these
troubles
yeah it's a good question
um I will say that I'm not sure that
everybody quote unquote needs it I think

[1:33:46]
everybody quote unquote needs it I think
some people are predisposed to operate
in such a way where they just have maybe
a more natural
disposition towards the uh the lessons
or benefits you would get from it

[1:34:01]
or benefits you would get from it
um that being said you know those are
not the people who would be referenced
in this case I I think anytime
people are overly negative
um or for me I feel like when

[1:34:15]
um or for me I feel like when
statistically improbable things happen
over a long time frame to me that's kind
of a sign if I take it as a sign at
least that I'm somehow missing something
and it's just it's a good time to look

[1:34:30]
and it's just it's a good time to look
deeper whether it's you know in ordinary
downswing or something else
um but I think anytime things aren't
going well or at least in the way that
you'd prefer let's say it's a good time
to look inside yourself

[1:34:47]
where's the because when I think about
spirituality and you know in poker
people obviously the first thing they
try to improve is that technical game
nowadays people are also way more open
in terms of like mental game performance
whereas like where do we enter the

[1:35:01]
whereas like where do we enter the
spiritual realm because a lot of times
when we talk about spirituality I could
basically put it under the umbrella of
like mental game mindset
uh performance aspects as well what's
kind of the crossover to spirituality in

[1:35:15]
kind of the crossover to spirituality in
that in that in that sense
you know it's funny like while we've
been having this discussion
um I don't talk about this stuff as much
nowadays it's just so much a part of
kind of uh

[1:35:30]
kind of uh
I guess who I am and how I operate that
I don't really know I feel like it's
largely just Blended I mean for me it's
just all of life
um
but that actually makes a lot of sense
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I think
putting it under the umbrella of mental

[1:35:45]
putting it under the umbrella of mental
game of emotional control tilt control
um
it makes sense uh it definitely goes and
with a lot of these uh Concepts and
ideas but yeah maybe different for

[1:36:00]
ideas but yeah maybe different for
different people
um not totally sure
I guess maybe I feel the same as you
which is reflected in why I asked the
question because I often cannot really
distinguish like the difference I just
see it as you have technical game and

[1:36:15]
see it as you have technical game and
they sort of have the rest right and
like belief systems and
um yeah discovering yourself for me you
could you could just put it under
development personal development I guess
all the all these categories I'm curious

[1:36:30]
all the all these categories I'm curious
like meet me and Adam we have a coaching
program mechanics of Poker shout out to
the mechanics of Poker we have like
technical management optimization mental
game performance mindset
if I were to ask you chewy we want to
ask we want to add spirituality in here

[1:36:45]
ask we want to add spirituality in here
well I like some of the first lessons
you would like to teach uh players maybe
you have something because I think you
have experienced coach uh in coaching
other players as well what are like some
common common yeah skills or wisdom that
you share

[1:37:02]
you share
so that's a good question
um
personally I I feel like one thing that
allows me to stay in touch with myself
is
as you know there's a variety of spots

[1:37:16]
as you know there's a variety of spots
in No Limit where you can choose to
randomize your decisions
and I feel like if you are
in flow enough in touch with yourself
there's often a compelling reason to go
one way or another and I think

[1:37:31]
one way or another and I think
developing some degree of efficiency
um or maybe efficiency is not the right
word
um
some degree of uh autonomy let's say to
be able to choose uh you know based on

[1:37:48]
be able to choose uh you know based on
not a sort of egoic feel of you know I
want to bet because I want to win the
pot or whatever but a true deeper kind
of sense maybe a gut feeling is perhaps
a decent way to describe it

[1:38:01]
a decent way to describe it
um I think that's one way in which it
reflects well for me and I will still
you know randomize certain decisions uh
when I feel like that's pertinent too
but I like maintaining that degree of
yeah let's say autonomy and creativity

[1:38:18]
yeah let's say autonomy and creativity
yeah that makes a lot of sense and RNG
definitely takes it away I think I think
randomizing is very much
misunderstood and misused quite often uh
when I see other players randomized for

[1:38:32]
when I see other players randomized for
a certain reason like um and at some
point there they're just rolling on
every street I'm like do you even have a
plan with his hand or are you just
trying to RNG for the sake of RNG like
they kind of miss the purpose of why
they were RNG in the first place I

[1:38:46]
they were RNG in the first place I
completely agree with you I think also
if you just say oh this is close I'll
just run the RNG I think it also kind of
stops your development because I'm more
in the philosophy of okay if something
is close it's an opportunity to make a
good decision because we all know you

[1:39:00]
good decision because we all know you
know players don't play perfect so every
time when you're in a spot where you're
not sure if going left or right is the
right option right and the solver would
agree they would do it 50 50 because if
he is close I think it's a good
opportunity actually oh in the future
what would be the optimal pure strategy

[1:39:15]
what would be the optimal pure strategy
in this situation versus uh general
population or versus a specific opponent
because if you don't really think about
this kind of things I think you're just
ah it's close it's randomizers RNG it
kind of
stagnate your progress would you agree

[1:39:30]
stagnate your progress would you agree
there
yeah
um in some ways you're diverting the
responsibility of making a decision
elsewhere I will say that if you truly
feel torn something that sometimes can
work is if you just RNG 50 50

[1:39:45]
work is if you just RNG 50 50
uh you
you know get a certain outcome and then
you might feel actually hey I really
don't want to do that and that can be
insightful as well that can work with
you know flipping and coin for any sort
of decision in life but it's always

[1:40:01]
of decision in life but it's always
interesting when you feel like okay now
I'm resigning myself for this oh wait I
actually don't want to do that or
sometimes Yes actually that feels quite
good so it can be a way to kind of I
think check in with yourself as well so
long as you treat it that way
yeah I think this is a little trick that

[1:40:16]
yeah I think this is a little trick that
our audience can use if you're in doubt
with something and you flip a coin
for it at the moment you're flipping a
coin subconsciously you will start
hoping for the coin to fall on one side
so you actually know what you truly

[1:40:30]
so you actually know what you truly
truly want uh now actually one one area
where I've I think RNG comes in handy is
to overrate your natural bias let's say
I honestly don't know in a certain spot
and you're naturally risk-averse you
always fold the river for example you

[1:40:46]
always fold the river for example you
have a closed Bluff Catcher And every
time if you don't RNG you just fold it
and you end up massively overfolding
let's say you're very curious by Nature
you always call so in this kind of
scenarios I do think an RNG can kind of
help
to keep your bias in line so to speak

[1:41:01]
to keep your bias in line so to speak
but again I think it should be okay at
this moment I'll RNG by hand but I'll
mark this hand to see if I can make a
better pure play on a later Street I I
just don't think running the RNG should
be
the end of it right uh I'm also curious

[1:41:18]
the end of it right uh I'm also curious
because
we exploitative players have this a lot
and I guess if you don't randomize in a
spot that is randomized you are I guess
exploiting right because you're taking

[1:41:30]
exploiting right because you're taking
up your strategy and you also mentioned
like if you if I would RNG a certain
hand and I know it would cause fifty
percent of Time full 50 of time and I
call and I Lose I'm like well five ten
you know I gave it to gave it to quote
the higher power the RNG decided for me
whereas if you don't RNG and you make a

[1:41:46]
whereas if you don't RNG and you make a
decision and you're wrong it's personal
so for the maybe four players are trying
to go a bit more down the drought how
would they have to deal with that
because I guess if you play a bit more
exploded more feelings of that come up
than if you play quote quote Theory you

[1:42:01]
than if you play quote quote Theory you
can blame the GTO model instead of your
own decisions
yeah I mean you do have to accept
responsibility and want yourself
accountable of course if you make a
decision it's wrong uh and in a larger
sense I think this is something that's

[1:42:15]
sense I think this is something that's
beautiful about poker is it just really
forces you to be very honest with
yourself and I suppose that could
largely be termed like a you know
spiritual component as well I think
spirituality is largely about being
honest with yourself confronting

[1:42:30]
honest with yourself confronting
yourself
um you know going face to face with who
you are and what makes you who you are
um
beyond that
uh let's see I have a thought uh on the
top oh yes so

[1:42:45]
top oh yes so
as you said if you you know decide not
to RNG a spot and you just take a pure
action
this is I guess where I look at things
maybe a little bit differently
um you're taking a pure action in that
isolated instance but if that spot comes
up again you might take the other side

[1:43:00]
up again you might take the other side
right and it's unlikely spots come up
identically over time but your opponent
has no idea uh in certain cases unless
they're
you know truly like amazing player
Captain uh understanding you know how

[1:43:16]
Captain uh understanding you know how
you're likely to respond in which case
of course that can really hurt you but I
tend not to really worry about that
stuff too much
um
unless you know there's sufficient
evidence that my opponent would have
reason to believe that I'm very likely

[1:43:31]
reason to believe that I'm very likely
to take a certain action and you know of
course that that wouldn't be great but
uh
yeah I I don't
um I don't mind that uh that element of
you know not RNG and and taking you know

[1:43:45]
you know not RNG and and taking you know
a certain action definitively in one
case uh because if that's what word
would reoccur you might just be on the
other side of the plane
yeah it's true and like how you play
versus one opponent you might play
different versus a different opponent so
in the end your stats they sort of kind

[1:44:01]
in the end your stats they sort of kind
of balance out I guess so yeah people
people honestly won't know I also think
usually people are a bit too paranoid
when it comes down to oh if I do this
I'm exploitable or I can be exploited
it's like yeah okay uh usually those are

[1:44:16]
it's like yeah okay uh usually those are
thoughts of paranoia I remember I looked
at quite a lot of data that actually
also shared in the mechanics you don't
really have to worry about or at least
in this case online poker uh adjusting
very hard to certain Tendencies it's
like the 80 20 principle right that like

[1:44:31]
like the 80 20 principle right that like
the most of the adjustment is done by a
small portion of the players that are
very exploited players themselves so
maybe if you can spot those the rest
will just be there and play their game
usually right especially online poker
you have other things going on you know

[1:44:45]
you have other things going on you know
multiple sites I'm looking for games and
playing a bunch of games I'm not going
to focus on one table where Chewie uh he
went for for a pure play instead of a
mixture here you know it's like how will
I ever find out so uh for for the people
uh listening and they have a very strong

[1:45:02]
uh listening and they have a very strong
voice in their head it's very paranoid
uh yeah something something you should
work on I'm curious like after going
through a kind of Reinventing yourself
uh how did your experience of playing

[1:45:16]
uh how did your experience of playing
poker change
so the actual playing
yeah
um
I guess it became more fulfilling I I
think you know there was a large

[1:45:30]
think you know there was a large
time frame let's call it when
late 2016 through it was like a two-year
time frame it was like two years after
my two years of sort of removing myself
um where I wasn't doing particularly
well at poker uh I think I had to

[1:45:48]
well at poker uh I think I had to
re-imagine myself within the context of
the game and just in many ways remember
why I played poker initially which is
that it is fun and it's a game and I
enjoy games and I enjoy and love poker

[1:46:01]
enjoy games and I enjoy and love poker
especially
so
yeah I think that was like a big
um switch for me and
yeah it allowed me to
you know let go a lot of largely what

[1:46:16]
you know let go a lot of largely what
you're describing now which were sort of
ideas that were plaguing my mindset
because
you know 2016 was sort of early piyo
days my mind was elsewhere I had a lot
of stuff going on in my life that was
non-poker related and I sort of missed
the boat on the the beginnings of that

[1:46:32]
the boat on the the beginnings of that
and then as I sort of continued to play
certain uh you know games experiments
live especially I would see players
playing differently I started to doubt
myself and

[1:46:46]
myself and
um yeah I mean I was missing out on on
learning
you know new ideas and that wasn't
benefiting me but what was much worse
than that was sort of the extra pressure
shame doubt guilt that I was putting on

[1:47:00]
shame doubt guilt that I was putting on
myself
um and you know with sort of a new
understanding of
I guess how to exist in the world I was
able to to let those go and it of course
eventually led me towards the path of uh

[1:47:15]
eventually led me towards the path of uh
you know pursuing studying poker in the
modern era and taking full advantage of
what these tools have to offer so I like
stories with happy endings and
fortunately we have one here
so obviously you know poker has changed

[1:47:30]
so obviously you know poker has changed
a lot free resolve our posts over area
how
did solvers impact your your strategies
and did you experience any struggles in
the beginning like I said you have a
certain strong intuition you've built
strategies over the years without using

[1:47:46]
strategies over the years without using
solver so I guess certain solver outputs
will challenge certain things that you
believe to be true that the solver says
is not true how did you deal with uh
yeah working with solvers when they came
out
well I would say this has kind of been

[1:48:01]
well I would say this has kind of been
ever presence challenge where
you don't
always have the
um foresight or the ability to know how
much to trust certain outputs in large
part I would say

[1:48:15]
part I would say
pre-flop and flop are fairly reasonable
Fern is good and River can sometimes
just be way off base because of how far
off the beaten path you get
of course matter if you're playing
against if you're playing against elite
players this stuff matters a lot you're

[1:48:31]
players this stuff matters a lot you're
playing against you know non-elite
players probably doesn't really mean all
that much and you're back to square one
of just playing a game like the good old
days I don't mind that and I think that
was something that I was more recently
maybe challenged by I think you know a

[1:48:47]
maybe challenged by I think you know a
better part of of last year I was maybe
a little bit too reliant but it was
double-edged because I was having a lot
of success in high stakes utilizing
these uh you know strategies and then in

[1:49:00]
these uh you know strategies and then in
like mid-stakes or you know lower high
stakes I wasn't and I feel like I was
sort of missing the mark on some of that
going back to the earlier days I think I
was in a receptive enough state that I
was kind of just able to put to use any

[1:49:16]
was kind of just able to put to use any
new idea and there was such a large gap
to fill so it wasn't until I kind of
solidified a bit more of a modern
understanding of how strategies look
across various decision points and stack

[1:49:31]
across various decision points and stack
depths and and so forth uh that I
started to then have to have these you
know deeper questions of when where why
how much so on and so forth
I think you touch on a very important
point there where you said that you then

[1:49:47]
point there where you said that you then
ask certain questions so you already go
into the solver with a certain curiosity
like when why what
how do you think what is the right way
in your opinion the right curiosity to

[1:50:00]
in your opinion the right curiosity to
enter a solver people usually go to it
to check if they play the hand well it
doesn't really sound like that's kind of
your your Vibe with the solvers
yeah I don't mind doing that
um it I would say in times where I do

[1:50:15]
um it I would say in times where I do
that
it's more it's not so much to check my
individual hand it's more to check if I
had the idea right about the spa and if
you have the idea right then often you
did get it right with your hand
but I think the way that I learn is

[1:50:31]
but I think the way that I learn is
is largely just extracting heuristics
from various situations and then being
able to appropriately Place those
heuristics in game based on you know
whatever type of spot you find yourself
in you know understanding when certain

[1:50:47]
in you know understanding when certain
sizing schemes make sense understanding
when you want to lead understanding uh
yeah what thresholds are for Value
betting or for calling down and then how
to adjust those I think that's really
what I I find most beneficial

[1:51:02]
what I I find most beneficial
um about these modern tools
yeah I completely agree and just kind of
what I meant with when you look into
software you're looking for a certain in
your case you're looking for what why
certain heuristics right I mean you play

[1:51:15]
certain heuristics right I mean you play
mtts of an entity is one of the most
complex so instead of studying 10bb 20
bb30b40bb all the flops you know be
before you're done
poker is already over sort of you know
you you're basically on your on your

[1:51:31]
you you're basically on your on your
dead path so that doesn't really help
yeah you have to get a few under your
belt so you can have a baseline right so
exactly but but instead of studying like
oh I don't know 1700 something flops uh
you know you probably break it down to
certain flops a smaller subset uh

[1:51:47]
certain flops a smaller subset uh
instead of just focusing on how
everything changed with my focus okay
what are in general some heuristics I
can use in low SBR situations medium SBR
situations High SBR situations you know
what what what changes if for example

[1:52:01]
what what what changes if for example
you get short and you start to shove
certain hands so he doesn't have that in
his range anymore both of other kind of
the consequence of that you're trying to
learn the bigger picture and I think
what this does
is just you know assembling let's say 10

[1:52:16]
is just you know assembling let's say 10
heuristics uh that you kind of play from
right that you use guidelines for
certain bed sizings guidelines for
certain hand choice I think these are
definitely things solver can really help
you with but from there also allowing
that creativity that I that I think you

[1:52:31]
that creativity that I that I think you
mentioned as well and I can imagine or
personally I struggled with this as well
where you kind of go through phases
where it's too much solver none of
creativity and in the passive might have
been too much creativity too little
solver it's like a constant or I

[1:52:45]
solver it's like a constant or I
experience like a constant
I don't want to say struggle but a
constant dance between the two sort of
yeah it is a dance it's somewhat of a
challenging dance I often think of it as
like left brain right brain it's like

[1:53:00]
like left brain right brain it's like
creativity and logic like
Artistry and science uh it's I'm very
much a believer that it is a synergistic
blend and is kind of the responsibility
of the individual to figure out you know

[1:53:15]
of the individual to figure out you know
how to how to mesh these things together
um and it's uh you know the picture is
never fully painted like like you're
saying you know understanding these
thresholds
yeah I mean I understand some of them
and I know there's so many more to
understand and then the mtts especially

[1:53:32]
understand and then the mtts especially
a lot of the models only account for you
know equal stock distribution and you
have mixed Stacks you know the big one
only has four blinds or you know the
opener has 70 and there's some amount of

[1:53:45]
opener has 70 and there's some amount of
ICM in play everyone else has 15. I mean
there's there's so many things that uh
you can account for that can slightly
adjust strategies and I quite like that
I think I really actually
um I find that very enjoyable whilst

[1:54:00]
um I find that very enjoyable whilst
playing not knowing but having some idea
and being able to on the Fly kind of
rocket and uh you know pick out the the
meaningful ideas that that would inform
the strategy especially when you have
like Fringe hands

[1:54:16]
like Fringe hands
yeah I think that's a cool part of Poker
which I think also plays a bit into your
strengths right yeah
I would say so
uh he also mentioned that you know you
you kind of

[1:54:30]
you kind of
went off the grid for like two years
less input usually when you have less
input when you do a lot of meditation
you also get more in touch with how you
feel how do you feel like that period
has strengthened your intuition because
we when we when we think about poker

[1:54:45]
we when we when we think about poker
hands we have like The Logical side that
like I said my right side brain left
side of brain the bio side The Logical
side then you have the intuition side
and I think especially people are not
really used to using their intuition I
guess everyone uses it to a certain
degree uh how has your trust and your

[1:55:04]
degree uh how has your trust and your
connection to your intuition uh
strengthens or increased over that
period compared to so you're playing a
poker hand before those two years and
after those two years how much more in
touch are you now with your intuition

[1:55:17]
touch are you now with your intuition
well I'm definitely more in touch with
it
um I think in large part I was able to
just understand it better and
yeah give more life to it I guess
appreciate it more trust it more

[1:55:31]
appreciate it more trust it more
as we said everyone kind of has it it's
just a matter of how much you're willing
to let it in
um
yeah I can recall certain instances
before that where it would just sort of
pop up and I didn't really get it but

[1:55:46]
pop up and I didn't really get it but
then I started to feel like okay there's
something here
um so yeah I would say it was just a
phase that allowed me to clarify
um experiences like this which
previously were yeah just sort of a bit

[1:56:00]
previously were yeah just sort of a bit
foreign I didn't quite understand them
I think it's uh
problem that I often have when you're in
let's say you're in a wrong bit of in a
bad state of mind you're in a downswing
then your intuition of often be quite
sensitive to bias as well so I think

[1:56:16]
sensitive to bias as well so I think
it's very important to
to have developed a certain level of
self-awareness that you can kind of spot
okay this this emotion is purely biased
or this is my intuition right it's it's
like almost there there's various
people's you're in a poker hand you're

[1:56:30]
people's you're in a poker hand you're
making a decision there's various voices
shouting at you it's like you have your
buyer shouting at you you have your
intuition shouting view you have logic
shouting at you here like guys
calm down trying to make a decision here
and I guess throughout that period I can
imagine that voice or I guess the other

[1:56:46]
imagine that voice or I guess the other
voices they silented more and you're
more in touch with your intuitive voice
right when you become more present
through for example the act of
meditation
yeah definitely but again I would say
that that is kind of an ever-present
Challenge and maintaining that

[1:57:00]
Challenge and maintaining that
connection going further
um I don't really think much like the
other things we're discussing I don't
think that is a process that ends when
you keep going with it and I would even
say to a certain degree
while my on the other side of the coin

[1:57:15]
while my on the other side of the coin
logical theoretical understanding has
improved uh that
it works well with intuition generally
but in the uh you know specific
identification of intuition it doesn't
always assist in that so

[1:57:32]
always assist in that so
yeah it's double edged
I'm curious you mentioned psychedelics
before have you ever done psychedelics
and afterwards jumped into the solver
uh

[1:57:45]
uh
I've tried this I've tried to uh or play
poker study poker but studying while I
was high was real it didn't work at all
but I've played you know under the
influence of cannabis many times and

[1:58:01]
influence of cannabis many times and
that's gone quite well so
yeah I don't know nothing stronger
though like
psilocyburn or else do anything
um
maybe some for a future Experience
Podcast episode two week and we can talk

[1:58:16]
Podcast episode two week and we can talk
about all the strategical
uh strategical uh progresses you've made
during that study session
perhaps maybe we have one together who
knows yep sounds like a great idea to me

[1:58:32]
hi guys Renee aka the weko here with a
quick mechanics of Poker 2.0
announcement in our program you'll get
access to 80 plus hours of content in
which we will explain you all aspects
needed in order to become a more

[1:58:46]
needed in order to become a more
successful poker player now one of these
of course is the technical aspect of the
game in which I'll be explaining you all
the mechanics behind poker strategies
we'll be talking about GTO exploitive
play with an extra focus on the why

[1:59:00]
play with an extra focus on the why
behind certain strategies and why the
population has certain leaks and to
increase your win rate even further
we've recently added a River Bluff and
Bluff catching section so you can
increase your in V when those spots
become very big our mindset and

[1:59:15]
become very big our mindset and
performance coach Adam Carmichael he
took care of the mental game and
performance section of this program in
which he will teach you everything you
need to know in order to break through
limiting beliefs better handle your
emotions break free from tilt and player

[1:59:31]
emotions break free from tilt and player
a game more consistently and last but
not least we've added the management and

Discord Community monthly live q a calls
and one-on-one coaching session in which
we are going to be reviewing if you have
been implementing the stuff that we
teach you in the mechanics of Poker
correctly so do you think you have what

[2:00:15]
correctly so do you think you have what
it takes to master the mechanics of
Poker go over to mechanicsofpoker.com
and maybe you will get a chance to work
with me and Adam and make more progress
in your poker career but for now without
further Ado let's get back into more

[2:00:30]
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode
uh you you
played a lot of cash in the past you
should play heads up bring then you
switch to tournaments do you
did you struggle at some point like

[2:00:46]
did you struggle at some point like
switching into tournaments and what do
you think are like some common mistake
cash game players make when they switch
to tournaments
I definitely struggled
um
I mean I think cash players playing
tournaments make a lot of mistakes

[2:01:01]
tournaments make a lot of mistakes
uh I think
one is that they just don't have any
sort of sense for
um how the different stack that's affect
opening and re-betting ranges
I think they often although not always

[2:01:18]
I think they often although not always
fail to adjust for the ante
um I think
often they kind of over adjust for ICM
although that's not always true
sometimes you know I kind of mentioned

[2:01:30]
sometimes you know I kind of mentioned
an experience where I was way under
adjusting
kind of go both ways depending on the
individual
um but yeah I mean it's just a
completely different format
um
so yeah there's you know just having
having those lower spr on average is

[2:01:49]
having those lower spr on average is
it's just totally different you know
really having to understand what the
thresholds look like for stacking off
uh when they're kind of in foreign
territory it's just not not always that

[2:02:01]
territory it's just not not always that
intuitive it can be in some cases which
have top of range all the time so that's
pretty easy have a pair
for me for me to want to play uh uh
lower SBR situations tournaments

[2:02:15]
lower SBR situations tournaments
shopping and stuff I know that I'm
naturally my bias leans towards being a
bit more nitty I like to be in control I
don't like to be forced to stack off
light I like to I don't know I have to
certain risk adversity in me so I always
know that in short SBR situations in

[2:02:31]
know that in short SBR situations in
cash games for example three by four but
Bots or in tournaments or in cash games
if you play cello tables stuff like that
I just know that like when I say oh okay
I'll stack this hand off at or I'll
check race check this end of it 15 BB

[2:02:45]
check race check this end of it 15 BB
it's probably closer to like 2025 and
the same like if I oh I'm gonna shove
Ace 8 here then probably it's ace four
plus you know so it's like I my my
intuition is wrong like I haven't
studied this this spot enough but from

[2:03:01]
studied this this spot enough but from
what I've studied this usually it's like
what my intuition says plus you know
like 20 25 is hands then you're probably
good to go that's kind of my my
guideline for tournaments yeah it's a
good realization to have to kind of
understand where or how you missed the

[2:03:16]
understand where or how you missed the
mark in certain cases and it brings up
kind of an interesting
I guess let's call it like a
philosophical tournament idea which is
let's say you're playing you know a
tournament where you have an incredible

[2:03:31]
tournament where you have an incredible
Edge over your opponents
um you know how much risk should you
take on in certain cases like if it's
early enough in the tournament sure
at certain later stages I mean some
plays just print
um in other cases it's not so clear

[2:03:47]
um in other cases it's not so clear
I think this is where
you're sort of having to split hairs but
I think it's where a lot of edge comes
from is really being able to make
correct decisions

[2:04:00]
correct decisions
um practically speaking against players
that you do have a large Edge on and not
just falling back into that
complacency of well I know that like you
know in equilibrium you know hands much

[2:04:15]
know in equilibrium you know hands much
better than mine would stack off it's
like look if the guy just has a better
hand than you you're going to lose
you're going to walk out of the room
you're going to feel dumb so you have to
like keep it real with yourself and
yeah uh I guess that's you know where I

[2:04:31]
yeah uh I guess that's you know where I
think in live poker especially you can
gain a pretty significant Edge uh just
you know being very honest about
do I have the best hand or not and so
yeah sometimes that's a good question to
ask yeah that's that that it's it's
interesting because like GTO poker

[2:04:46]
interesting because like GTO poker
focuses a lot on like playing from your
strategy from your range and then we
actually forget to ask this question
like what does my opponent actually have
oh yeah wait maybe versus that range I
should do something completely different

[2:05:00]
should do something completely different
than you know based on what my own
strategy wants to do from like an
equilibrium GTO perspective but it's
because of the way solvers work we
stopped to ask these type of questions
whereas a solver actually based on you
know we had to put in something for our

[2:05:15]
know we had to put in something for our
opponents and he's doing something based
on that as well right but I feel like a
lot of very GTO were in the oriented
play they kind of forget to ask this
question like what do you actually think
your opponent has and what's like the
optimal line to take with your hand
versus that hand

[2:05:30]
versus that hand
and I think everyone has been there that
I immediately had a flashback where you
know you make a quote quote equilibrium
play you bust a tournament like I said
you feel a bit like an idiot but you
feel like an idiot when you stand up you
walk outside the room you look around
and you see Fish everywhere like oh why

[2:05:45]
and you see Fish everywhere like oh why
did I just do that it's like and this is
something indeed like a software doesn't
take if you just look at one output it
just shows like hey this is the output
but it doesn't take future play in
consideration right the fact that or for
example I remember in the although in
the beginning of my career I would play

[2:06:01]
the beginning of my career I would play
a bit more live entities and if I would
be moved to a bad table
to just be like hey this is a bad table
I'm gonna sit there for a couple hours
Let's Take It Easy before I get moved to
a better table with bigger opportunities
right to to make money and this is again

[2:06:15]
right to to make money and this is again
something that the GTO mindset players
they kind of forget about these type of
aspects and I would say even like sort
of future if he is true in cash let's
say let's say I usually see it like this
let's say you have a fish who come sit
down he has one hour to play okay and

[2:06:31]
down he has one hour to play okay and
I'm in the small blind
and the fish has folded and now I can
choose my strategy let's say I go for a
limp a limp only strategy let's let's
let's take that one that's I think
probably the worst because on average I
will take quite a lot of time playing a

[2:06:45]
will take quite a lot of time playing a
limping strategy so the pops in that
hand will take longer so so this guy
will play less hands versus the fish
because the fish only is going to play
one hour and he's going to leave at some
point so I would much rather for example
play a 35 pfr only because I just fault
and the next hand that dealt I get to

[2:07:01]
and the next hand that dealt I get to
play more hands versus the recreational
player and that means you know that my
future EV so basically I need a stronger
hand or I need to play a strategy that
in order to play my head it has to have
more EV because the future EV of the
next hand is bigger right it's just like

[2:07:16]
next hand is bigger right it's just like
in tournaments actually it's the same in
cash games
um and I think these are considerations
that people
yeah don't often make because we're too
focused on just playing our hands
correct quote quote correct uh in in

[2:07:30]
correct quote quote correct uh in in
that moment
yeah no it's a good point and I think
tools will evolve to uh
be able to account for these kinds of
things over time and uh I'll certainly
play some role in helping to build those

[2:07:46]
play some role in helping to build those
um but I'm definitely very interested in
yeah what is what is possible
um as far as modeling things go
you know the purely static outputs and
there even are some uh there is some

[2:08:00]
there even are some uh there is some
ability to to model with fgs but it's
fairly limited uh and certainly not
telling the whole story and if anything
it's
painting an inaccurate picture because
of the fact that it is only partially

[2:08:15]
of the fact that it is only partially
accounting for
uh you know the future hands down but
sometimes it does line up with intuition
I've found and and that can be useful
just in in a sense of verifying what you
think is already probably accurate

[2:08:30]
think is already probably accurate
yeah that's kind of this the the problem
with with the static model you think
that in the near future for example we
use solvers now that are based on more
static models so you think in the near
future we will get similar products out
there that are more like AI based that
can take all these things in

[2:08:45]
can take all these things in
consideration definitely that
um
I have sort of uh
um so full disclosure like I have a
poker startup
um I'm pretty
in interested in this space and uh it

[2:09:01]
in interested in this space and uh it
will launch later this year
um but yeah there's a variety of things
that I I see happening already and
things that I want to do I mean I think
one really cool idea would be
um sort of a back engineering of uh of

[2:09:17]
um sort of a back engineering of uh of
solutions like if you play a hand in a
certain way and you get told like okay
that's not an equilibrium being able to
see what would have had to have happened
uh from your opponent for that to have
been reasonable
uh

[2:09:30]
uh
you can then look at it and be like oh
does that actually make sense sometimes
it will and sometimes you'll be like
yeah well my opponent probably wasn't
jammed with their whole range so well
what are you gonna do we'll get them
next time
so it's almost like an intuition check
in some ways yeah

[2:09:46]
in some ways yeah
um
I mean I think being able to quantify
Intuition or some other intangibles that
would be a whole nother project
I would love to
be able to do that in some ways that is
what
Dr Gerald espenza has

[2:10:02]
Dr Gerald espenza has
done or tried to do or at least shed
light on generally I don't know if
you've been to any of his Retreats I
went to a week-long retreat oh cool yeah
it was it was really awesome I would I
would definitely recommend it not a lot
no it's definitely it's definitely on my

[2:10:16]
no it's definitely it's definitely on my
list
yeah we had a great time
um but yeah if if and when you go you'll
have some more exposure to some of the
stuff they do
yeah it's very much in this in the same
vein or line of thinking

[2:10:32]
if we think of like the solvers or for
example the stuff that you're working on
where do you think they what how do I
ask this question where or what do you
think makes them gain an S over humans

[2:10:45]
think makes them gain an S over humans
and where do the humans gain an edge
over the machines in in real life
well the machines certainly have an edge
in the sense that given the inputs they
don't lose
the humans have the edge in that the

[2:11:02]
the humans have the edge in that the
inputs are not static and the models are
not static the gameplay is not static
um I know there's been a lot of
discussion of like you know if IO played
a tournament like would it win and it's

[2:11:15]
a tournament like would it win and it's
kind of a question you can't really even
answer because
what is inevitably going to happen is it
just faces a zero percent node also
Pilots just a heads up program so you
actually need better software to even be
able to sort of Broach that that line of

[2:11:30]
able to sort of Broach that that line of
thinking you're just going to reach zero
percent nodes where the solver is just
guessing
um we're maybe not purely guessing but
it's for all intents and purposes
guessing you'd rather have a human play
zero percent node than a solver where

[2:11:45]
zero percent node than a solver where
it's just like oh I don't know what to
do because this didn't happen you know
the player didn't mean bet through
streets so
you know what he's supposed to do with
that yeah exactly insightful whereas for
example if you have an AI that you give

[2:12:00]
example if you have an AI that you give
I don't know 100 million 100 million
online poker hands he said uh I've seen
this situation uh 35 times over 100
million hands I know exactly what to do
here right right yeah I can see that in

[2:12:15]
here right right yeah I can see that in
the near future we have like the new new
generation of players that like wait you
guys grew up with pile solver how did
you how did you guys make money back
then this program is antique
right and we're like wow no this next
Generation stuff man

[2:12:30]
Generation stuff man
yeah I feel like you know if we relate
it to chess what we've seen thus far is
somewhat equivalent to like the deep
blue era with Kasparov where we kind of
saw okay computers really can hold their
own and this is it's real stuff like the

[2:12:46]
own and this is it's real stuff like the
industry is changing and the game is
changing and now we're starting to see
that next Generation kind of like the
Leela chess zero Alpha zero that kind of
stuff
um
yeah I couldn't miss out on that it's a
little bit too exciting for me some of

[2:13:00]
little bit too exciting for me some of
Poker nerd at Heart Like I want to know
you know the answers essentially I want
to see
uh I want to see and be a part of the
industry growing and changing I find
that
yeah very very enthralling

[2:13:15]
yeah very very enthralling
and for the people that are listening to
this and give up all the hope of Poker
like many have done before when Huds
came out then when solvers came out what
do you think remains to be the Hope like
just like with solvers for example there
are there but there's still a lot of
play for example they're not using them

[2:13:30]
play for example they're not using them
or they're using them wrong do you think
it's going to be the same with like AI
driven technologies that you'd be like
oh wow this is available and you know
how to use it you like okay poker is
dead but luckily there's still players
who don't use it or are gonna use it
incorrectly
I guess using it incorrectly is a bit

[2:13:46]
I guess using it incorrectly is a bit
harder intuitively ideally ideally as
the programs become better and more
efficient using it harder
you know not as much of an option or
using it incorrectly is not as much of
an option it's just easier

[2:14:00]
an option it's just easier
um but I think that there's sort of this
simultaneous elevation where the games
get harder for them the access to
information gets better so
yeah I mean you like I noted earlier
pretty black Friday there was a lot of
just free money free money is sort of

[2:14:16]
just free money free money is sort of
slowly become less and less
um and yeah pokers become more
competitive uh but I don't really think
that's too surprising
and uh
yeah I think that's just sort of how

[2:14:30]
yeah I think that's just sort of how
it's going to be but I don't think poker
will ever really die obviously there are
certain challenges that poker faces
um online poker especially fair play and
whatnot uh
yeah I'm also very interested in

[2:14:45]
yeah I'm also very interested in
maintaining the Integrity of the games
although that's
yeah not a sort of individual challenge
that's a more Collective challenge
yeah it's a it's a future
I I think the only thing we can uh like

[2:15:01]
I I think the only thing we can uh like
I think the only thing that will help
you moving forward and with you I mean
you know people listening kind of having
uh adapter time mentality that's kind of
my motto you just should adapt to the
new Circumstance the best you can and
that's it if you don't you die like I

[2:15:17]
that's it if you don't you die like I
said people who have died when online
poker came out when Hots came out when
solvers came out various people kind of
you know who didn't adapt with the new
cultural kind of State in diagonal but I
want poker to be this way they kind of
fell behind so that's kind of all you

[2:15:31]
fell behind so that's kind of all you
can do in my opinion again moving
forward if this stuff comes out I'll be
happily using it and I'll be trying to
see how I can help it to become a better
player and I think that's kind of the
only way forward so Adam how do you see
the the future of

[2:15:47]
the the future of
online poker or poker in general because
I guess we there's always a difference
right between the future of online poker
and poker I think live poker is not
really threatened I would like to get
your thoughts on that as well Andrew

[2:16:01]
your thoughts on that as well Andrew
yeah it's hard to predict obviously
based on what you guys are seeing it's
very kind of exciting times in certain
aspects the game evolving and strategies
and learning tools becoming more high
level at the same time it comes quite
scary of like as an individual how do

[2:16:15]
scary of like as an individual how do
you kind of make money apart going
forward so uh I'm not going to get my
crystal ball out and try to predict that
I think you're kind of
um summary in terms of adapt
adaptability becomes more important as
things move fast as technology becomes
more apparent and usable the ability to

[2:16:30]
more apparent and usable the ability to
adapt to those and use them for your
situation becomes very important so yeah
be able to Pivot and then the day of
pogger comes down to can you find games
where you have an edge and when you go
to live games empty teas there's many
opportunities to make Edge if you want
to play the toughest online games in the

[2:16:45]
to play the toughest online games in the
world the high stakes okay that's going
to become more challenging and you need
to level up it's the same like if you
look at sports if you want to be the
best in the world of your sport you're
gonna have to go ahead and take with
some very very accomplished people who
are also having that same goal see I

[2:17:00]
are also having that same goal see I
think there's always in my opinion in
the end the next let's say five years of
Poker many other news to make money for
players just starting out now or who are
already doing really well I don't see
this kind of Doomsday mentality that
some people see it's the funny I think
all of us got into but name right in
particular around Black Friday time

[2:17:15]
particular around Black Friday time
that's when I started my career I
started my career two months after Black
Friday and some guys were sending me
articles going Adam do you know no you
missed it it's done POG is done I was
like if I missed it I was reading these
articles saying that Pockets over and I
was like all right well I'm gonna start
the wrong career path yeah and I think

[2:17:30]
the wrong career path yeah and I think
the next thing always from the outside
can signal the ends whereas the next
Evolution what's the next evolution of
Poker I think it's it's an exciting
thing from one aspect and as long as
you're willing to adapt I think you'll
you'll find a way hopefully to uh to
make a big for you which is just good
all right it's cool I want to kind of
transition the conversation to a bit of

[2:17:46]
transition the conversation to a bit of
reflecting first of all I want to wrap
up the story of your kind of story Arch
going through poker I think we got to
around the time where you've went
through your kind of reinvention you've
done a lot of your kind of meditation
you've removed yourself from poker and I
think you mentioned coming back to poker

[2:18:00]
think you mentioned coming back to poker
in over two years our results not going
your way so it's probably somewhere
around 2017 2018. tell me through one
change from there and then how was your
how things go on the last year two or
three years from that moment
yeah so um

[2:18:16]
yeah so um
end of 2018 I had a huge score in
Bellagio five Diamond I got third for
800 something thousand
um and that
did coincide with some new feelings

[2:18:31]
did coincide with some new feelings
towards the game or perhaps old feelings
renewed
um and that really
I mean obviously it's you know
incredible life event that really
reinvigorated me and I got back into
tournaments playing traveling uh

[2:18:47]
tournaments playing traveling uh
the following year so I had a decent
amount of success in mid to higher
Stakes
um then 2020 prove it happened so I
transitioned online and that was really
I I had started getting more into

[2:19:02]
I I had started getting more into
studying in 2019 2020 when traveling was
no longer an option and even playing in
casinos wasn't an option that was when I
really got heavy into studying
um and then that kind of has continued

[2:19:15]
um and then that kind of has continued
and I've just sort of you know continued
to play bigger and uh kind of becomes
somewhat of a Mainstay in the higher
Stakes tournaments at least Stateside I
did just recently get back from a trip
to Bahamas and even T Paris where I

[2:19:32]
to Bahamas and even T Paris where I
played some bigger stuff as well
um haven't made it to any Triton Events
yet just hasn't really worked out
schedule wise but I'm quite excited to
it seems awesome really well run and
obviously really big events

[2:19:45]
obviously really big events
um so yeah that kind of brings us to
modern day I play high stakes
tournaments play mid-stakes tournaments
um I really like tournament format also
from a practical perspective a lot of
the cash games in Vegas have become
privatized so

[2:20:00]
privatized so
as far as finding Edge like doesn't
really make sense to try and at least
for me like I'm sure if I put in enough
time I could get in I'm pretty friendly
and I think uh
I probably would make people feel
welcomed and enjoy my presence in the

[2:20:16]
welcomed and enjoy my presence in the
games but you have to play that whole
kind of pandering and political game and
it's just not really for me whereas
tournaments I can just go play so yeah
that's kind of where I'm at
I think the Corvette period they say
2020 through to 2022 has been a very

[2:20:31]
2020 through to 2022 has been a very
interesting periods for most players in
their career because everything just got
shut down on the live scene and now all
everyone's on their computer is playing
online poker if they want to play during
that time and also you've got a lot more
time to study I think a lot of players
through this time actually I actually

[2:20:46]
through this time actually I actually
speak to a surprising number of players
who actually got into poker during that
time with like all right I'm in my
computer Now's the Time to get deep into
poker and the games were really good so
much of the games you were playing were
very juicy compared to what they
normally were but the online action
across the board seemed to really Spike

[2:21:00]
across the board seemed to really Spike
and it almost became this like new
opportunity to get back into poker and
there wasn't many other options it's
like play video games or play podcasters
most of us are locked down or very
limited opportunities and I think it's
very interesting how that's kind of been
a segue moment for a lot of players
careers to get deep into solvers to

[2:21:16]
careers to get deep into solvers to
reinvent their strategy and to become
better players overall whereas other
players made a shy away and we're not
okay things aren't looking good right
now I'm gonna go down in the path and
maybe drift away from poker think
yourself and other players I've spoke
with have used that kind of periods to

[2:21:31]
with have used that kind of periods to
uh to study a lot so when you see um
once during that period of time you got
deeper into solvers or what were some of
the things you were doing during that
kind of lockdown period
yeah so I formed a few relationships
with um friends who were kind of in a
similar place as me were some of my uh

[2:21:48]
similar place as me were some of my uh
friends I've known for a longer time and
poker had sort of elevated their game in
previous years using these tools
um so
yeah just performing study groups with
people who were kind of starting where I

[2:22:02]
people who were kind of starting where I
was at a lot of experience in poker not
as much experience using these tools and
and just yeah using like figuring out
how to use them more efficiently
um how to extract useful things from
them and then just yeah generating lots

[2:22:17]
them and then just yeah generating lots
of outputs was
kind of what I spend a lot of time on
one thing I'm always impressed with is
longevity because longevity requires the
ability to adapt to different climates

[2:22:30]
ability to adapt to different climates
and pools and to almost find a way to
come out on top and do that over and
over again if you look at like the
debates of sport of who's the greatest
of all time any sports it often comes
down to who could hold their Peak the
longest who could almost like stretch
out year after year of longevity of good
performance everyone's got their own

[2:22:45]
performance everyone's got their own
Peaks they've sent periods but often
longevity is a big factor at least when
I assess like who who would win that
kind of theoretical debates now for
yourself you've had a very long poet
career and I'm curious to know what you
think are some of the key attributes
that have allowed you to still be a

[2:23:00]
that have allowed you to still be a
poker now and have a success I'm
watching some of the yeah kind of key
attributes behind your longevity and
pocket
yeah I mean I think
number one foreign capital of it like if
you don't love it the people who just

[2:23:15]
you don't love it the people who just
play poker because
uh they see you know this pot of gold at
the end of the rainbow it just
eventually Fizzles it just never works
out long term you can do it for some
period of time but eventually you're
just gonna spin your tires and just not

[2:23:30]
just gonna spin your tires and just not
gonna you're just not gonna be able to
continue to you know stay strong when
it's not going well
um I think you have to be very
disciplined with you know the amount of
volume you put in uh with the amount
that you study especially nowadays

[2:23:46]
that you study especially nowadays
um you have to be humble you have to be
honest with yourself
um I've had a lot of conversations with
a number of my friends about how I think
poker is actually a great vehicle for
self-growth and I know some University

[2:24:02]
self-growth and I know some University
professors will use poker as a way to
articulate or or show uh you know
different ways of problem solving and
how those apply to the real world so
yeah I think in many ways

[2:24:17]
yeah I think in many ways
uh the more I evolve on a personal level
the more my poker evolves with it and
vice versa I see them very much
intertwined that's probably somewhat

[2:24:31]
intertwined that's probably somewhat
unique Maybe
to myself or perhaps to us it seems like
we're kind of on the same page with a
lot of these things but uh
yeah I do I don't think that's a
particularly common view
it's almost like the loving polka is the
prerequisite and if that isn't true for

[2:24:47]
prerequisite and if that isn't true for
you at some point like you said you will
run out of motivation if it's just for
the material things or the money so
that's got to stay for a long time and I
think that's often a challenge for
players because I think as you do evolve
your Motors change while you play
podcast obviously the fun elements may

[2:25:01]
podcast obviously the fun elements may
stay but for example the claim is very
different like yourself live with
friends in Vegas studying poker and
trying a couple of strategies is very
very different to you looking to solve
as in 2023 and trying to do a couple of
strategies the game is the same on a
fundamental level but it's different and

[2:25:16]
fundamental level but it's different and
you have to evolve how you think about
podcasts you keep that love going so I
think like as we talked about before the
ability to adapt your approach to
learning to improve in over time needs
to be there to keep that look for the
game then the thing you mentioned which
I thought was the most important was
your own self-growth and your growth as

[2:25:31]
your own self-growth and your growth as
a poker player being in the same Pursuit
I have many conversations with players
who were almost like haven't linked
those two things together that's where
like they think pork is very separate
it's almost like my pocket life and my
life I think they can have very separate
entities and be almost like when I have
success in poker then I'll put more time

[2:25:46]
success in poker then I'll put more time
into like growing my Evolution and I
think like players who have a lot of
longevity and talker they find a way to
merge those two very quickly not very
quickly but at some points your growth
is a poker player and your growth as a
person we almost can't separate we
struggle to define a line where I see it

[2:26:01]
struggle to define a line where I see it
how will you grow as a poker player and
you wouldn't tell me how you're also
grow as a person I think once you've got
those things worked together you're
loving the game you're growing towards a
bit meaningful and poker is the vehicle
for that growth then you can stay up for
a very long time you add into that good
network of people you're around to

[2:26:16]
network of people you're around to
inspire you who are kind of on the same
journey and now you've got kind of a
recipe so to speak for a Long Point
career so yeah I think you've nailed all
the ingredients in terms of what um what
I've seen around players who've had long
careers and sometimes sometimes that
happens organically sometimes it takes
work obviously yourself you've had

[2:26:30]
work obviously yourself you've had
almost like stopped and slowed things
down do some inner work to recalibrate
but it's never taking you too far from
the pocket path which I also find
interesting that yeah POG has always
been a part of your life has there been
any time games where you've seriously
questioned if polka was gonna be a thing

[2:26:45]
questioned if polka was gonna be a thing
for you like almost like I'm gonna walk
away from polka it's it might not be
what in line with my growth has been any
doubt in moments like that
yeah it was definitely that phase where
I went through that transition in the
you know what's called 2017 was a
particular challenge here for me

[2:27:01]
particular challenge here for me
um and I remember
around the time that I was sort of
recognizing that I actually do still
love playing and I I want to stick with
this my wife asked me like do you want

[2:27:15]
this my wife asked me like do you want
to play high stakes again one day it was
interesting because I hadn't really
thought about it it was like
yeah I think I do
and then I sort of had just you know
kept asking myself like checking in with
myself and asking like as I continued
with it like is this something I'm

[2:27:30]
with it like is this something I'm
interested in and it quickly became
apparent that I was
um
so yeah certain you know sort of
Milestones along the more recent past uh
have been particularly fulfilling
because of that you know moment of sort

[2:27:46]
because of that you know moment of sort
of setting out on this path I'm not I'm
not a super goal-oriented person
generally
um but
yeah generally having direction or like
super objectives I'm a fan of so
in this case yeah it was it was quite

[2:28:01]
in this case yeah it was it was quite
nice to have a
I like that idea of testing your
assumptions and testing your beliefs and
when your partner asks you do you want
to play high stakes again if you ask
that to you when you're 23 24 you're
like yeah of course like the answer is

[2:28:15]
like yeah of course like the answer is
100 yes but as you evolve as a person
you sometimes got to test those
assumptions is this still true and now
30 35 and do I still want to play high
stakes I think sometimes we struggle to
or we forget to reevaluate what we do
play pocket for and what was the meaning
behind it so uh I think it's really nice

[2:28:31]
behind it so uh I think it's really nice
for yourself and sometimes we need a
catalyst moment around us but to
reevaluate like is there still a trip
coming do I want to play poker for for
the same reasons and if not what does
that mean how is poker now fit into my
life and yeah I think that's a healthy
thing for most of us to do to reevaluate

[2:28:46]
thing for most of us to do to reevaluate
why we choose certain behaviors and if
you've held on to a certain assumption
or belief for a long period of time can
you reevaluate that given your current
substances and this is all true if it
doesn't hold true can you let that go
because I found let's say with your
assumption let's say you didn't want to
play high stakes pocket I'd say the

[2:29:00]
play high stakes pocket I'd say the
answer was I'm feeling some like the
answer knows this question but your
identity is still high stakes poker
player or your peers around you and
validate you as being a highest Explorer
player now you've got some realization
to do wait a second do I keep doing this
because that's my Identity or do I need

[2:29:15]
because that's my Identity or do I need
to somehow drop that and reinvent myself
again so yeah I think that becomes a
challenge if you do uh run into those
moments where you do have to reevaluate
what your decision points yeah what
really well said
um and it reminds me of I guess another
core belief of mine which is

[2:29:32]
core belief of mine which is
um I really do things for their own sake
not because of what I think I'm gonna
get out of them
and I feel like that
um
that helps sort of uh get affects the
chase with the actions that I take in my

[2:29:45]
chase with the actions that I take in my
life
um and I I suppose I
you know I probably messed that up from
time to time but it's it's again a nice
thing to have a sort of guiding
principle I love that doing actions for
that one stake on their own sake because

[2:30:00]
that one stake on their own sake because
that's very powerful if you apply that
to everyday life and anything you do if
you did it for its own sake that's the
end of the discussion so it was like why
did you do that and the answer was
because I do this there is no and
there's no way to go it's just all about
game jump down but very often we don't
live our lives that way we actually live

[2:30:16]
live our lives that way we actually live
we do something to get somewhere we do
something for the outcome we will get in
the future or as a byproduct whether
it's achievement whether it's respect
and if the the goal of the kind of the
principle that you live by I do things
for their own sake it completes a very
short Loop very quickly so yeah I think

[2:30:31]
short Loop very quickly so yeah I think
that's a thing we can learn to apply can
you learn to do things for their own
sake and if not why not do you need a
motivational external thing to make you
do the thing or to do the thing that
you're you're currently doing or can you
find a way to uh feel like you're doing

[2:30:45]
find a way to uh feel like you're doing
for its own sake so in terms of
practical perfectly applying that
how do you feel like you were live by
that let's say you were your day-to-day
and you do things for their own sake how
do you stop the Mind from potentially
going to the Future because if I think
to myself like one of my challenges is I

[2:31:00]
to myself like one of my challenges is I
spend so much time in the future I'm
always like create this magical place in
the future which is going to be better
than where I currently am which often
makes me miss very important moments
where I know the moment in front of me
is really key but my mind is already
thinking how this is going to lead to
the next one so for yourself doing
things that are on sake how do you

[2:31:16]
things that are on sake how do you
either live by that or remind yourself
when there is the temptation to go to
the Future
yeah that's a good question
um again I probably messed this up
sometimes um but I think the way that I
sort of let it

[2:31:31]
sort of let it
um
you know take impact in my life is
uh yeah just feeling out what like what
feels best in some ways I guess you
could say it's a way that creativity
enters my everyday life

[2:31:45]
enters my everyday life
um
yeah I guess with as far as like letting
future events impact the the current
ones
I'm a very visual person I think like I
see a lot of images in my mind and the
way I would sort of look at it is you
see the current events and you see where

[2:32:00]
see the current events and you see where
it goes and then just maybe drawing it
back in and like not acknowledging that
future event I think one of the ironies
of
doing things because you think you're
going to get something out of them is
that's actually much less efficient and
when you do things you know purely for

[2:32:15]
when you do things you know purely for
their own enjoyment uh like you said it
completes the loop quicker and it
actually just sort of gets you closer to
what it is that you're interested in I
think like you know your interest your
excitement your your you know internal
Joy
um it's a it's a quicker like it's a

[2:32:32]
um it's a it's a quicker like it's a
that's your true north star like that's
where you should be going anyway and
it's going to lead you to more of those
things and when it doesn't it's going to
highlight uh you know inefficiencies in
your belief system or your actions or
your personality structure

[2:32:45]
your personality structure
um
yeah very very interesting I can picture
my own kind of relationship with
meditation when I first got into it the
kind of motivation behind having a
long-term habit was I heard Tim
ferrissey on one of his podcasts that 80
of high performers meditate on a regular

[2:33:01]
of high performers meditate on a regular
basis I was like high performance
meditate 80 of them I want to be one of
them so I'm going to meditate so they're
very goal-oriented relationship with
meditation to get an outcome of being a
high performer and all the kind of
benefits and started reading up all the
benefits you could get from it and this
for the first probably six months to a

[2:33:16]
for the first probably six months to a
year meditation was the goal to get to
an end State and then there was a nice
transition Point probably a year of
meditating more stairs where I was like
ah meditation's just its own thing like
I feel good during it I feel good after
it is there anything else that I need
from it and it becoming a very nice

[2:33:31]
from it and it becoming a very nice
um it changed like the way I was
coaching as well because I was trying to
teach players to uh kind of create a
habit to get an outcome promise and then
also become just an activity that
completed itself and as I went for my
life recently I tried to apply the same
thing that you're saying to uh can the

[2:33:45]
thing that you're saying to uh can the
action itself be the complete nature of
why you do is how you feel about it how
you do it and just it almost like
completed
um its own journey and you don't need to
to take you anywhere and that becomes
challenging because I think especially
as poker players we're very good
orientated at least a lot of players are

[2:34:00]
orientated at least a lot of players are
we see outcomes we see where we want to
get for things but can we find a way to
engage in our behaviors as a means to an
end in themselves and if not why not can
we evaluate our relationship with things
so yeah I think it's a an ongoing
Pursuit with our lives that we live owns
yeah hopefully it gives players some

[2:34:16]
yeah hopefully it gives players some
incentive to uh to question those things
yeah all right so when reflecting on
your career what would you describe as a
particular high point I know we've
talked about a lot of your successes
what would you say was a point where you
feel most proud or you look back and it
was a period that gives you some joy to

[2:34:32]
was a period that gives you some joy to
reflect on
wow
um there's quite a few uh I've told this
story on a podcast before but I will
tell it again because it sort of fits in
so that end of 2018 phase where I place

[2:34:45]
so that end of 2018 phase where I place
third in appalachio tournament uh it was
a big breakthrough you know I was in a
slum and
um outside of you know sort of the
financial benefits which were
significance uh it was you know also
just that sort of I was on that
teetering edge of am I going to stick

[2:35:00]
teetering edge of am I going to stick
with poker I don't know what's going on
I wasn't able to find results and
rediscovering my love for it but there
was a particular instance in the
tournament where
we were 24 left and I ran like a really
big Bluff in a spot where uh you know

[2:35:18]
big Bluff in a spot where uh you know
from a purely logical standpoint doesn't
really make that much sense you know
it's like two giant Stacks going to war
um but I don't know just felt right and
it uh

[2:35:30]
it uh
ended up working and I was pleased with
myself in hindsight that uh you know I
was able to outside of all the other uh
pressures you know kind of take the
action that I felt was uh correct in
that moment and stay true to myself

[2:35:46]
that moment and stay true to myself
of course one could argue that that is
results oriented and that you know so
and this is the the ongoing struggle
that you face in poker and in
post-mortem analysis is you know just
because it worked doesn't mean it was
always correct but you know I think what

[2:36:02]
always correct but you know I think what
I've noticed over a long time frame is
the players who seem to have the best
results are the ones who take the
correct actions so
yeah it was it was a very fulfilling uh
experience overall and that was one

[2:36:15]
experience overall and that was one
moment that stuck out over the course of
that uh you know tournament itself
did anything feel different about that
tournaments or about that moment in
particular compared to the rest of your
career obviously it was a pivotal win
point but what I'm trying to get at I
remember listening to live Berry talk
about the very important kind of

[2:36:31]
about the very important kind of
tournament her career whereas everything
is spelled different like the Energy
felt different she felt like she was
going to win this tournament I think she
even said you heard like almost like why
you say you're gonna win today and this
tournament against felt different it was
very pivotal for her career going
forward because it created like a

[2:36:45]
forward because it created like a
bankroll to kind of progress from it's
hard to get a pinpoint because it always
touches on this kind of hard to kind of
grasp on kind of spiritual nature but
was anything about that tournament where
it just felt a little bit different like
things that are lying differently maybe
you'd let go of expectations differently
maybe more more relaxed going in was

[2:37:01]
maybe more more relaxed going in was
there anything different about that
tournament other than just the argument
cell
yeah definitely more relaxed going in um
I I think I have a another story that
might be more of your interest for this
question
um this was sort of when I was just
getting into

[2:37:15]
getting into
Moore's uh spirituality yoga meditation
and such
um I had a pretty significant and out of
all the experience at the table where I
had called the three vet and I just kind
of
felt myself like float up above my body

[2:37:34]
felt myself like float up above my body
where I was and I sort of had this you
know like more expansive view I just I
kind of got this intuition that my
opponent had
a hand that made drips and uh you know I

[2:37:47]
a hand that made drips and uh you know I
yeah it was just interesting I mean the
hand itself wasn't that interesting I
had open industry draw and called twice
and pulled the river
um but yeah it was just a very sort of
unusual experience I haven't had
anything really quite that powerful

[2:38:01]
anything really quite that powerful
since but looking back perhaps it was
you know a catalyst by which my ability
to feel and Trust intuition uh was
solidified to some degree

[2:38:16]
solidified to some degree
um would you say an experience like that
allowed you to trust yourself more would
you say like that feeling that
connection to yourself there's gonna
one-off kind of moment where you left
your body so to speak the tables getting
that had like a long lasting kind of
impact on your either
your ability to stay on the path towards

[2:38:31]
your ability to stay on the path towards
self-discovery or potentially uh draw
that connection even stronger to your
intuition did you have any sort of long
lasting effects
definitely
um anytime I've had experiences that
transcend physical reality I feel that

[2:38:45]
transcend physical reality I feel that
those are
most integral in kind of you know
keeping me going
um I I feel like that's one of the most
interesting things about life and
particularly I would say our culture and
you know Eastern cultures it's a little

[2:39:00]
you know Eastern cultures it's a little
bit less
um
taboo or unusual to discuss these things
and I think in in many ways the culture
is changing and certainly there's been
pockets of Western culture throughout
time whether it's you know
of the 60s or just generally kind of

[2:39:17]
of the 60s or just generally kind of
West Coast
the way it's evolved that's been more
receptive to these ideas
um but yes I would I would definitely
say so it's it's very encouraging
yeah nice so what would you say is the

[2:39:31]
yeah nice so what would you say is the
biggest lesson that Focus told you you
can look back on your career and one
lesson maybe a surprising lesson
something that you wouldn't have
expected to have gained on the book of
six and then it comes to mind
I think in an overarching sense the fact

[2:39:45]
I think in an overarching sense the fact
that it has so closely aligned with
self-development is not something I
would have expected going in
and it's just yeah been so repetitive
and consistent throughout my career that
my life has you know sort of

[2:40:00]
my life has you know sort of
tagged along with my poker playing
uh
yeah
and what are some of the biggest growths
you've had as a person through poker
what do you feel like why are you a
better Vision now than you were before
you played a single Honda poker

[2:40:16]
you played a single Honda poker
that's a good question
well I would say that
um
having to deal with the highs and close
is it's actually not trivial I think a

[2:40:30]
is it's actually not trivial I think a
lot of people I would imagine a lot of
the guests you know watching those
reviewers uh will have played some poker
but I think for people who are outside
of Poker
it's um
it's it's probably imagined that the

[2:40:45]
it's it's probably imagined that the
winds are much you know easier to deal
with and the losses are probably much
farther and I think this is a challenge
that I would say
myself and a lot of other space which is
you want to still be able to feel the

[2:41:02]
you want to still be able to feel the
sadness I think there's benefit in that
I think there's you know ways in which
that's actually healthy or really not
sadness but disappointment or just loss
generally
uh and then also feel the winds but not

[2:41:16]
uh and then also feel the winds but not
feel them to such an extreme that you
get overly euphoric and make bad
decisions or get overly depressed and
hold yourself back and it's like pretty
tricky to strike that balance I think
dealing with the emotional swings that
poker has just sort of innately built

[2:41:30]
poker has just sort of innately built
into it
um and and understanding how to manage
those has been something that um I'm
pleased with
yeah I think that's a very important
topic just touch on where basically us
poker players we experience a lot of

[2:41:46]
poker players we experience a lot of
emotions that say approve the highs and
the lows and you need to find a way to
deal with that and I think a lot of
poker players especially early in their
careers think the kind of solution is to
feel less to be more numb to be robotic
so you not have to experience the pain
of losing and this very often also it

[2:42:02]
of losing and this very often also it
means they nullify the wins it doesn't
feel as good to win you almost like numb
your emotional centers overall I think
the kind of where you've talked about it
is much more healthy where you learn to
experience both the highs and the lows
you don't run away from anything you
almost become the experience of all of

[2:42:16]
almost become the experience of all of
it but also you don't get dragged around
by any of it you're not like super high
when you're winning you're not super
down the jumps when you're losing I
think that's the ultimate place to be to
let everything in for me to experience
everything but to not get dragged around
by it I think this is a an almost all

[2:42:30]
by it I think this is a an almost all
public place they've had a lot of
longevity in poker and got to this point
whereas players who are new out on their
Journey can't even imagine it because
the the highs are so high and the lows
are so lower that the thought of being
quite balanced throughout it all almost
seems idealistic and I was like well
yeah but I've lost 10 miles today how

[2:42:45]
yeah but I've lost 10 miles today how
does that not hit and it's almost like
it's almost this like hard to explain
kind of concept of getting to a point
where you're okay with everything you're
okay with the wins you're okay with the
losses it doesn't mean they feel the
same it doesn't mean that going on the
biggest damage of your life feels the
same as winning care in a high roller it

[2:43:00]
same as winning care in a high roller it
just means that they just are you're
okay with each of those I think you can
get to that point all of a sudden like
your experience of life is completely
different in every area because now
nothing can hurt you so to speak because
everything's in its own context if you
win you lose earns almost nothing simple
maybe some things but not many things in

[2:43:15]
maybe some things but not many things in
terms of results wise are as Extreme as
your poor career in terms of Investments
you have you could make some mistakes
there but generally poker is one of the
most volatile Landscapes so if you can
learn to be okay with everything that
comes at you pocket wise you've
calibrated your emotional responses very

[2:43:31]
calibrated your emotional responses very
well this generally leads to all areas
of life I have many conversations every
week with pocket players people are
struggling with their emotions in poker
and almost all of them and not all of
them but a lot of them are fighting away
from the tables they have no problems in
their personal life no problem in
day-to-day life but the pocket tables oh

[2:43:46]
day-to-day life but the pocket tables oh
that's where everything comes up so
that's the growth path that we've been
talking about I think if you can yeah
can I stay with that and come to their
sides yeah like the calibration of your
emotional experience just makes the
overall
um experience of Life much more
fulfilling I do feel like there's a

[2:44:01]
fulfilling I do feel like there's a
danger for certain players especially
very logical driven players to want to
uh not experience anything to not feel
anything and I've been around some of
these players in real life and I know
it's like their overall experience of
Life often feels quite known at least
like not as heightened or fulfilled and

[2:44:15]
like not as heightened or fulfilled and
you find a way to kind of experience
everything I think is the the end goals
yeah I'm glad you touched on that
all right final question from me what do
you think has been the greatest
contributor to your overall success so
we talked about loving the game being

[2:44:31]
we talked about loving the game being
humble having a lot of discipline in
fact there's a lot of definitely in fact
it is is there any other factor that has
contributed to your book of success
um I would have to you know give a lot
of credit to
um whether it's my wife or my family or

[2:44:46]
um whether it's my wife or my family or
just the friends I've made along the way
um just having good people around you
supportive people loving people there's
really no greater gift than that
um whether inside poker out of it and
it's just a huge contributing factor to

[2:45:01]
it's just a huge contributing factor to
you know as we're talking about when
things aren't going well
um being able to you know just not focus
on the game and focus on all the other
great things you have in your life
yeah I I think that's kind of a slam

[2:45:17]
yeah I I think that's kind of a slam
dunk answer for this question
so what would you say there were
aspiring poker player who's in their
early 20s and they haven't really got a
network around them or a big friend
group let's see like starting to go
deeper into poker and they're starting
to find themselves a little bit isolated

[2:45:31]
to find themselves a little bit isolated
from their current peer group and
they're here you say that's it's really
important to write a network around them
but at the same time they feel like
they're on a very solo Pursuit almost
like a lonely pursuit of a online
grinder they kind of realize that it'd
be nice to have a network around them
but it doesn't seem to quite fit with

[2:45:46]
but it doesn't seem to quite fit with
their pursuit of winning and achieving a
poker is there any advice you would give
to that can Avatar I know those type of
players listening who to remember that
decision point in terms of what do you
do if you want to achieve at all cost at
the moment and you haven't at the time

[2:46:00]
the moment and you haven't at the time
or you're still working on developing a
network or people around you who are
going to be you know relationships
yeah that's a great question I I think
in some ways that's part of like the
proverbial Heroes journey I certainly
went through that to some degree uh I I

[2:46:17]
went through that to some degree uh I I
suppose I did mostly have friends around
for
almost the whole portion of my
progression in poker but um
yeah leaving family and moving to places
um I I think that there's also uh you

[2:46:32]
um I I think that there's also uh you
know some amount of of power in those
experiences of
um you know solitary uh poker playing
but definitely it's not going to last so
yeah I mean finding people that maybe

[2:46:45]
yeah I mean finding people that maybe
are playing the same games as you or I
think you know if you're fortunate
enough to find mentors that's huge it's
obviously not that easy uh for a variety
of reasons largely people are charging
for coaching
um you know maybe getting a coach and

[2:47:02]
um you know maybe getting a coach and
sort of meeting people through them or
or just meeting people through social
activities that are also playing poker
and uh
yeah maybe joining groups group studies

[2:47:15]
yeah maybe joining groups group studies
sessions uh I know there's a lot of
forums across
different communities
um
yeah I think I think there's ways to
meet people and it's just a matter of
how how much it matters to you whether
or not your life going to succeed

[2:47:31]
or not your life going to succeed
it's interesting how many players in
situation yourself in high stakes have
good networks around them and it's
almost like it's one of those things
where like aspiring players I think
sometimes can almost like forget or not
understand how important it is to invest

[2:47:45]
understand how important it is to invest
in relationships and I think especially
your everyone was the kind of most
probably like out there in terms of
sharing on two plus two or writing on
forums meeting up a lot more kind of
frequently and you guys almost like your
personality traits attracted like like
men and people to themselves I did feel
like this no matter what your situation

[2:48:01]
like this no matter what your situation
is invest in heavily or at least invest
in some of your kind of resources into
relationships has got to be like the
policy they like play like regardless of
where you're trying to go you've got to
find a way to invest your time and
energy into your nurturing relationships
I think that can be a challenge for

[2:48:16]
I think that can be a challenge for
players who haven't already done that if
you're already a social person and you
understand like having a good network is
important it becomes natural because
often when I have this conversation
players it's one of two camps it's
either it's just natural floors for them
they've always had good friends always
like oh it's quite challenging I have to

[2:48:31]
like oh it's quite challenging I have to
always like go up out of my way to to
speak with people to uh to reach out but
yeah I think trying to find time to
invest in relationships should be the
the play for everyone if you've got
healthy relationships make sure you
nurture them make sure you uh spend time
with people and if it costs easy so to

[2:48:46]
with people and if it costs easy so to
speak to spend time with friends or
connect with people I think it's always
worth it because as you touched on now
your growth as a person links very
heavily to your girl is a poker player
and yeah I think relationships are
almost everyone going to be a huge part
of it so yeah great life lesson and

[2:49:00]
of it so yeah great life lesson and
thanks for thanks for sharing your your
journey
all right Renee any questions for
yourself
I'm I'm interested you just touch on the
topic of EV right and you were talking
about success I'm curious uh to ask
Chewie like what your definition is of

[2:49:16]
Chewie like what your definition is of
success
yeah it's a good one uh what is my
definition of success I mean I suppose
that again going back to Childhood the
way that I was raised like happiness was
always prioritized

[2:49:31]
always prioritized
um so I've kind of thought about that
and I feel that that is actually
something that is important for me to
prioritize as well
um
I think freedom is is one of the biggest
benefits that I've found through playing
poker

[2:49:46]
poker
um you know building your own schedule
being able to spend time with the people
that you want to when you want to
being able to spend some money on things
that are important to you taking trips
traveling all that stuff
um

[2:50:00]
um
yeah I guess just living
meaningful lot a meaningful life and
continuing to improve uh being happy and
enjoying your experiences being grateful
uh
I guess
being wholesome yeah I don't know all of

[2:50:18]
being wholesome yeah I don't know all of
it together
meaningful I think is a is is a very
good word so if you look at your poker
career in the beginning and now going
forward like you you've reinvented
yourself I think many times for poker

[2:50:30]
yourself I think many times for poker
what gives you meaning in poker
currently
I think
well
I think that is even currently changing
to some degree uh
with the involvement of you know the

[2:50:47]
with the involvement of you know the
tech side that I'm getting into
but beyond that I think just playing
playing and meeting people
playing and testing myself
continuing to face the challenges that

[2:51:00]
continuing to face the challenges that
the game presents and seeing how they've
changed over time
uh that is that is Meaningful for me and
seeing that you know I still have a lot
of room to grow in certain areas
yeah I very much enjoy that

[2:51:17]
yeah I very much enjoy that
yeah and when you say areas to grow as
we touch them right it's not only poker
technically it's so so intertwined
between the two live and poker you you
cannot really distinguish between the
two I've I've had similar experiences

[2:51:31]
two I've I've had similar experiences
I've done only coaching for quite a
quite a period of time and I really
missed being a
yeah miss being a performer like a poker
player and like the challenges that it
gives in one way I was kind of I was
kind of missing the struggles because I

[2:51:45]
kind of missing the struggles because I
felt like
if you're a poker player it raises the
necessity for you to show up as a better
version of yourself and I noticed that
when I was not a professional poker
player I kind of felt like I slacked off
a little bit I didn't really like the
version of myself that much and now that

[2:52:01]
version of myself that much and now that
I went back to playing a lot of Poker
I'm way more
yeah you know you feel challenged you
feel more enthusiastic you have more
energy uh
not only like I said not not only in
terms of my poker game but also you know
start to work more with a therapist

[2:52:16]
start to work more with a therapist
doing like more meditations uh
manifestations visualizations you name
it everything you know to yeah to to to
discover
a better version of yourself or a deeper
version of yourself or a different
version of yourself however you want to

[2:52:31]
version of yourself however you want to
call it so I think that that's that's
very interesting uh in terms of like EV
you know it's a topic often discussed
with players and how you treat EV and
the decisions you make around EV how
does that evolve for you through life I
can imagine in beginning you know you

[2:52:46]
can imagine in beginning you know you
think about everything in EV and
everything gossipee so in the end when
your V is that you'll do nothing else
than playing it's almost like an EV trap
I would almost say you cannot do
anything else because yeah your AV poker
is too high so even if you would want to
do something different you sort of can't

[2:53:00]
do something different you sort of can't
because your poker EV is too high I can
imagine you know when we're thinking
about if it's only money but throughout
life like you said something that gives
you meaning relationships how has like
your view of EV and the decisions that

[2:53:16]
your view of EV and the decisions that
you make based upon the change over your
career
yeah it definitely has changed
I have been more willing to not play I
think I'm someone who putting in

[2:53:30]
think I'm someone who putting in
significant volume has very rarely ever
been an issue
um and in some ways not playing has been
more of a challenge in some cases and
some some days you can just kind of tell
like this is you know probably not a
good day to play and forcing it in those

[2:53:46]
good day to play and forcing it in those
moments has led to
uh you know just sort of unnecessary
loss so I think those are the cases
where if you look at it from a you know
purely EV perspective it's just like
okay I'm putting in hands I have an

[2:54:00]
okay I'm putting in hands I have an
hourly I'm earning here but sometimes
you can just kind of feel like today is
not the day I need to just you know stay
home read a book go out with a friend
you know go on a jog flip some weights
do whatever it is

[2:54:15]
do whatever it is
um and being receptive to that and I
guess trusting that intuition uh has
been something that I've done a better
job of trusting uh over the more you
know the past few years but
yeah still a challenge

[2:54:32]
yeah still a challenge
yeah like like like we said right every
every year reflecting on that you see
that you've grown the challenge will
it's endless right it's infinite
um I'm curious like you've developed a
lot of skills throughout playing poker

[2:54:45]
lot of skills throughout playing poker
what skills you think transition very
well into quote normal life and what
skills kind of hinder you from
performing at your best in normal life
so I think

[2:55:00]
so I think
in normal life
the skills that transfer well are
problem solving and thinking on the Fly
and I feel like this is somewhat
verified by the fact that a lot of poker
players do find success in other
industries that have these qualities you

[2:55:18]
industries that have these qualities you
know as a fairly integral part of what
it takes to succeed in them
um the qualities that don't transfer as
well
I think are

[2:55:30]
I think are
maybe maybe you know it's kind of the
same thing where when you don't have to
problem solve or think on the Fly and
you try to apply those qualities uh it's
like well yeah those are good qualities
but they're not what's needed really in
in certain cases

[2:55:46]
in certain cases
um I guess this would the thing that
comes to mind is like more Artistic
Endeavors
it can kind of go both ways I guess
there but that's just what's coming to
me
uh

[2:56:02]
uh
I I think in many ways it is kind of how
you approach poker that is going to
determine how well your skill set
transfers and
yeah if you approach it from a more
holistic perspective you'll probably

[2:56:15]
holistic perspective you'll probably
be more able to adapt to other things I
like what you said earlier like adapt or
die kind of a big fan of of adapting as
a general concept
um
but yeah I I do I do really believe that
the poker skill set is very transferable

[2:56:30]
the poker skill set is very transferable
and uh
yeah I enjoy seeing people who leave
poker have a lot of success elsewhere
often it is those similar Industries
although I would say not always
in terms of your own experience outside

[2:56:46]
in terms of your own experience outside
of Poker you mentioned your deck startup
I think you've mentioned figure working
on a poker side in the past I don't know
how that how that turned out but I think
you've mentioned that you've tried other
things outside of Poker any Lessons

[2:57:00]
things outside of Poker any Lessons
Learned in these areas
that you're taking with you for example
in your current Tech Deck startup like
okay I learned a bunch of things along
along the years these things I should
not do these things I should do
yeah definitely
um
I mean I'm really grateful to have a

[2:57:17]
I mean I'm really grateful to have a
you know awesome mentorship in this case
uh and that's somebody who is already
very successful in Tech and they wanted
poker mentorship and I was interested in
business mentorship so
yeah I'm seeing I'm seeing actually

[2:57:31]
yeah I'm seeing I'm seeing actually
firsthand where the poker skills that
I've learned and honed over the years
are applicable and where they're not a
lot of what I'm realizing about
excelling a business is that you have to
have you know
people skills right to be able to manage

[2:57:46]
people skills right to be able to manage
you have to
um yeah just have a
yeah the types of things that are useful
in poker but I guess not necessary
um

[2:58:00]
um
and then the problem solving is still
still solid like that's always going to
be useful being able to see okay you
know
given these parameters you know what is
the right way to approach this situation
being able to hone in on the things that

[2:58:15]
being able to hone in on the things that
matter and developing kind of the
pattern recognition for
you know similar things or similar
scenarios that have occurred in the past
um
yeah
you've somewhere in the beginning of the

[2:58:30]
you've somewhere in the beginning of the
conversation we talked a little bit
about um
you know when you're on a little bit of
a high you get maybe a little bit
overconfidence and you get some winners
tilt If you experience something similar
transitioning into other things than
poker like okay I'm a great poker player
so you know I can do this as well

[2:58:46]
so you know I can do this as well
because I'm good at poker even though it
has very little overlap
kind of the I think the halo effect they
kind of got yeah well that was my first
experience uh trying to waltz into the
startup world just thinking well winning

[2:59:00]
startup world just thinking well winning
a high rollers this is going to be a
piece of cake and indeed it was not uh I
learned very much the hard way
um in part that was the poker site I did
actually end up launching just didn't
really gain traction I found it very
challenging to kind of take it past a

[2:59:16]
challenging to kind of take it past a
certain point uh without the appropriate
mentorship
um and of course lack of resources I
mean you know it's just saying something
like that so long
um but yeah it was
definitely

[2:59:30]
definitely
um hubris on my part
and he has some influences where uh
people you know had their own sort of
ideas and I was maybe you know caught up
in the enthusiasm of others but

[2:59:46]
in the enthusiasm of others but
certainly not something that uh
like I was still very much at fault for
the situations I put myself in there
it's interesting that you mentioned that
part of the quote failure or why why it

[3:00:00]
part of the quote failure or why why it
didn't go further is you lacked
mentorship and the first thing you
mentioned in your new tech startup is
you found good mentorship so it seems
like you know you you've definitely
learned from the experience I can
definitely relate uh myself I remember I
was just focusing on getting to I6 poker
made High six poker and then I was like

[3:00:16]
made High six poker and then I was like
okay I want to develop into other areas
as well so then I went into coaching as
I thought that was quite a natural
transition try to start like a coaching
site and stuff like that but yeah
turns out that if you're a sex poker
player doesn't necessarily mean you know

[3:00:31]
player doesn't necessarily mean you know
you could also run a business or that
you actually would want to run a
business because I do think like I
always have the the the belief right we
talked a lot about beliefs that I can
make things work as long you know
there's always a way I will find a way
but then at some point also I had a call

[3:00:45]
but then at some point also I had a call
uh with a friend of mine it was like
Yeah but to like I understand this
belief and it's helped you a lot but to
what cause at some point like is this is
like what what do you have to prove that
that you can make this work like you you
look you look maybe not in the happiest

[3:01:00]
look you look maybe not in the happiest
state right now right you have a lot of
things going on there's a lot of
headaches you know problems with
business part and stuff like that it's
like yeah four watts in the end right
and that was actually an interesting
interesting uh and that's actually when
we sort of reinvented the coaching
company to how we do it now uh but I

[3:01:18]
company to how we do it now uh but I
because I realized that that belief yes
it's true I do think you know I can make
anything happen not everything right
anything that everything there is a very
big difference there
um but yeah to what cause and then when

[3:01:30]
um but yeah to what cause and then when
you succeed is that considered a win
that I think is also a very important
question like what is the win here so
let's say you do make it is that just
let them feel like a win is that
considered a win I think it's a good
question to reflect on like uh I think I
think it was Tony robbers I cannot

[3:01:45]
think it was Tony robbers I cannot
really think of think of the quote that
he mentioned but it was sort of sort of
like
if you arrive at where you want to
arrive does it then is that then
consider the win because if not you know
you're kind of doomed to fill
yeah I love that it's a great actor
um I do think sometimes uh

[3:02:01]
um I do think sometimes uh
I I don't know if this is like
ubiquitous amongst poker players or if
other people do it but I think poker
players are pretty eclectic Bunch so
maybe it is just more commonly found in
our community but yeah
putting ourselves through these

[3:02:15]
putting ourselves through these
challenges where it's like okay we can
do it but isn't really gaining anything
we make it across the other side of the
river and it's like
wow that was really hard and um I'm not
gonna do that again and then life just
kind of goes back to normal I don't know

[3:02:30]
kind of goes back to normal I don't know
it's goofy it's a goofy thing it it is
very goofy indeed I think this was
interesting like when I think like
nowadays what I learned is that I don't
say yes that easily anymore or when I
say like okay that sounds like fun I
kind of feel like oh wait I don't know

[3:02:45]
kind of feel like oh wait I don't know
kind of what comes with this idea like
in a practical sense and how long it's
going to take the energy is going to go
so that's made me way more conscious of
you know what you say yes to
so you have to think through it a little
bit more but on the other side it's also

[3:03:00]
bit more but on the other side it's also
yeah if I'm gonna think through
everything a lot then I don't start so I
have to kind of find like the balance so
on one on one side I think there's a
benefit of just throwing yourself in the
Deep you know and then try to not drown
and kind of learning that way
and the other compared to like the other

[3:03:16]
and the other compared to like the other
side of like inspecting the Poo from
every corner before you dive in right
yeah we kind of have to find a balance
in the middle I also think with age like
if you're still young in your 20s you
know by all means just jump in and start
trying not to drown but when you become

[3:03:30]
trying not to drown but when you become
a little bit older you know and also
other things in life take your time and
and your energy it's probably
better to to be a bit more how do you
say that
calculated with your decisions yeah
yeah I I agree I do think a lot of that

[3:03:47]
yeah I I agree I do think a lot of that
comes with age
um experience wisdom to some degree
um the other way I would describe it
just being more intentional
um
responsibilities often as you get older
at least that's how it's worked out for

[3:04:00]
at least that's how it's worked out for
me
um so yeah time is more meaningful like
I remember in my early 20s like I would
wake up I would go outside I would just
like lay in the pool and be like okay
well I could flip over today or I could
just continue laying here maybe I'll go

[3:04:15]
just continue laying here maybe I'll go
get some food it's just like you you
don't really have anything on your
schedule there's
you know I would routinely get people
calling me upset that I hadn't checked
my email in three weeks and my mailbox
was overflowing I mean I just did not
have like adult skills at all so

[3:04:31]
have like adult skills at all so
I guess you know with that in mind my
early business experiences didn't come
that accurately to me but fortunately
I've uh I've fixed those easy to fix the
basic you know adult task abilities

[3:04:45]
basic you know adult task abilities
um but I mean yeah it was just like
video games for you in the beginning
book for you in the beginning it's with
everything in the beginning right we
kind of have to expect that we sort of
suck in it and we yeah we kind of have
to feel forward right and try and try to
learn from our mistakes and remember you
know in the beginning of my career I

[3:05:00]
know in the beginning of my career I
went broke a couple times and you had an
optimistic father at an optimistic
father as well you always told me son
you know many of the successful
businessmen you know they went bankrupt
multiple times before they finally found
you know the business that actually
helped them flourish so even though I

[3:05:15]
helped them flourish so even though I
went broke a couple times in the
beginning he always kept kept those
motivational work working in the end
luckily it did all work out uh wrapping
this up what would you like the audience
to take away from
the conversation we had today

[3:05:32]
the conversation we had today
hmm
um
I guess just whatever it is that we
spoke about that kind of resonates with
them I think different parts will

[3:05:45]
them I think different parts will
resonate with different people I think
the self-growth group poker is a big
thing that
um you know just opening your mind to
that conceptually can really help
in terms of making playing more
sustainable and and more meaningful and
more productive

[3:06:01]
more productive
um yeah I guess that's that's probably a
nice Central Point to
reiterate
all right any other final words you
would like to share before wrapping it
up
um yeah I'll mention one last thing uh

[3:06:15]
um yeah I'll mention one last thing uh
and we sort of
talked about this or danced around it
but didn't explicitly get to it
um I I think there's two ways to be
motivated in poker or or in life let's
say and one is to kind of be motivated
by you know

[3:06:30]
by you know
anger and maybe grit to some degree and
another is to be motivated by like love
and understanding and trust and these
more sort of softer qualities but more
positive and uh I see where it's useful

[3:06:46]
positive and uh I see where it's useful
to be motivated by anger and I at times
have used that
um although I feel very strongly that
it's not as sustainable and my best
experiences in poker have been when I've
been in the most loving open-hearted

[3:07:00]
been in the most loving open-hearted
State and I guess I would encourage
people who
have maybe thought about this or on the
fence to sort of pursue that because I
find that you know at least personally
and that's kind of all I can speak from
is my own experience uh it's yeah much

[3:07:16]
is my own experience uh it's yeah much
better long run
I think Joe is also a big fan of that
right create from a state of abundance
instead of from a state of lack the more
you feel and lack the more you focus on
what you're lagging the more frustrated
you get let's say you know you're

[3:07:30]
you get let's say you know you're
playing and you're in a downswing and
you want something so badly and then you
know a 10 things happen again she's like
oh no even further away I was already in
so much lack now there's even more lack
and they only create more negativity
which usually doesn't really yeah it
creates more stress whereas if you're

[3:07:45]
creates more stress whereas if you're
already happy with your life and you're
abundant and it's like listen if I win
extra today it's great but I don't need
it
kind of you know chances are greater I
don't know if this is scientifically
proven but chances are great that you
will actually do well but also I think

[3:08:00]
will actually do well but also I think
as a consequence of the fact that you
don't experience all these negative
emotions all the time
yeah and it's also just like sustained
more sustainable from a standpoint of if
you feel better when you're doing
something because ultimately we all do
want to feel that love within ourselves

[3:08:17]
want to feel that love within ourselves
that fulfillment uh you're just breeding
that environment which is yeah just more
conducive to you know having sustainable
experience I think at times when I was
motivated by anger

[3:08:31]
motivated by anger
um yes it can be quite a performance
boost but it also sometimes you know
discourages you from actually playing in
the first place because if you're in
like a peaceful State and you want to
play poker and you're thinking
subconsciously already like well I'm
going to be angry it's I don't know I

[3:08:46]
going to be angry it's I don't know I
find it to be somewhat counterproductive
yeah I get what you mean with kind of
like the driven from anger let's say I
think people can relate to this let's
say they've been in a downswing at some
point they're like okay this has to stop
right now you know and then they get

[3:09:00]
right now you know and then they get
very motivated they they pick up
everything they try to take full control
and then it can turn around but I agree
being in that state foreign
you cannot live in that state for a
prolonged period of time I I do think
anger is is better than depression now

[3:09:16]
anger is is better than depression now
uh in terms of like how
productive they are neither may be as
beneficial as love but anger can kind of
get you going if you're interested yeah
exactly it moves you forward so you're
angry at the downstairs like [ __ ] it I'm
gonna I'm gonna take controls that where

[3:09:30]
gonna I'm gonna take controls that where
you're like more of a victim it's like
oh this downstreet never ends I suck and
you get into a depression you end up
laying on the couch and not getting out
of it yes very often associated with
lethargy just
um stagnation
all right well I think there was a lot

[3:09:46]
all right well I think there was a lot
of wisdom that we've covered today so I
want to thank you very much Andrew for
sharing that on our podcast I want to
thank Adam as well pleasure
the pleasure has been all ours thank you
again Mr Chewie for spreading all this

[3:10:00]
again Mr Chewie for spreading all this
wisdom with us a lot of good wisdom in
this podcast Adam what are your main
takeaways
where to start uh I think the main kind
of theme running through this
conversation for me was reinvent
yourself and using poker as a path for

[3:10:15]
yourself and using poker as a path for
growth and self-discovery and what I
like about Andrew's story is how long
his career has been and how many
Evolutions he's had to make I think it's
really nice to hear how every sort of
chapter of his life led to almost grown
up becoming a better version himself it

[3:10:30]
up becoming a better version himself it
was from those early days of hitting
rock bottom going Baroque and a little
about bankroll management it was then
going on some self-discovery and going
into meditation and yoga and got inwards
rather than at words they were kind of
rebalance himself then there was the the
more later ones where Andrew solvers and

[3:10:46]
more later ones where Andrew solvers and
how to think mobile poker in a more
fundamental level and yeah I think for
himself he kind of talked about how
poker and growth are kind of linked very
strongly for him and the paths are
almost the same at this stage when I
asked them what the kind of key to his
longevity was it was one he loves it two

[3:11:00]
longevity was it was one he loves it two
he uh likes to but he's humbled by three
he's like self-growth self-growth in
poker and he enjoys that Pursuit that at
least two next thing that was really
apparent to me was his use of intuition
how he trusts himself and he finds a way
to uh yeah be in tune with his intuition

[3:11:17]
to uh yeah be in tune with his intuition
and he's spent a lot of time by the
sounds of it fine-tuning that skill set
so it's not something where it's like oh
I I'm going to use my intuition in this
spot it's almost like what does my
intuition telling me in certain
scenarios and how do I fine-tune that
over a long periods of time so when it

[3:11:30]
over a long periods of time so when it
matters most I can trust myself to use
my intuition and one of his biggest pain
points was in a tournament when he
didn't use its into a ship so in his
career he learned the hardware that if I
go against my intuition this is going to
lead me to potentially make a mistake
that I'm going to regret later so I
think fine tune in intuition is being a

[3:11:46]
think fine tune in intuition is being a
really really big one and yeah I really
like the whole talk about his spiritual
journey and basically trying to find
meaning Beyond himself so to speak we
could have went very very deep with that
I think we hopefully covered it in a way
that is applicable to poker players and
trying to see your overall Life as a

[3:12:01]
trying to see your overall Life as a
kind of Journey and everything links
together I think the main kind of usable
takeaway from that is that everything's
kind of connected in a way we call it
separates opposite as a poker player
with our percent in life and we're all
just basically experiencing the moment
of life and this brought him brought us

[3:12:15]
of life and this brought him brought us
around to this nice realization which he
lives his life by I think he called it a
belief actually that every moment is
complete itself which I really love and
I think this is if you could apply that
kind of concept to do things for the
sake of doing them whether it's in habit
whether it's a Pursuit the self the act

[3:12:30]
whether it's a Pursuit the self the act
of doing something becomes its own
Journey not to get somewhere not to
achieve something I think myself got
away from this conversation I'm going to
think how I can apply that more because
one of my dangers is to think of how an
action I take will lead to a future
outcome so maybe I can learn more about

[3:12:45]
outcome so maybe I can learn more about
that philosophy of how to uh just do
things for the sake of doing them the
action itself becomes a complete circle
of of fulfillment or enjoyment in the
moment I think that'll be a powerful
lesson for myself how about you Renee
what are some of the main takeaways for
you no I mean I think for the majority
of people listening but definitely for

[3:13:00]
of people listening but definitely for
me as well uh definitely I I I
completely agree with that it's it's
again more of the things that came up
with me was like the surrendering the
acceptance the abundance I think these
are all usually good states to live from
instead of living from a state of lack

[3:13:16]
instead of living from a state of lack
for example I think that's something
I've been touching at the end uh indeed
also we talked about like how you can
improve in the technical area and then
there's like we just at some point I
think labeled a personal development the
spirituality is included in that because
sometimes it's meant to gain performance

[3:13:30]
sometimes it's meant to gain performance
because will certain spiritual uh uh
Endeavors increase your performance yes
so can we also just say it uh under the
name performance I think so and
especially people who kind of have a
fixed idea when I say the word

[3:13:45]
fixed idea when I say the word
spirituality a certain idea comes off
and then because of that idea they might
be shot off of it but I hope this
conversation definitely uh opened them
up that you know maybe spirituality can
actually help them and I think he named

[3:14:00]
actually help them and I think he named
it as a sign where if you constantly
experience certain thoughts or emotions
that are that are negative or experience
things that that shouldn't really be
experienced in a certain moment these
were signs that maybe you should do some
exploring on a spiritual level
he was very big on beliefs I'm very big

[3:14:16]
he was very big on beliefs I'm very big
on beliefs as well I know you're a very
big on beliefs as well especially the
fact that you will have to reinvent
certain beliefs and reflect on certain
beliefs because certain beliefs might
help you into a certain point or to
achieve certain things but then I think
it wasn't the example that I gave at

[3:14:30]
it wasn't the example that I gave at
some point the same belief that has
helped you achieve something could
actually stop you from achieving
something else and in the end his
definition of success was I think uh
meaning right so how can we achieve more
meaning in our life that in the end I

[3:14:46]
meaning in our life that in the end I
think was kind of the end goal we also
talked obviously about some poker
technical stuff we talked a lot about
solvers and the limitations of the fact
that it's a static model right that was
kind of the acid humans have while we
can take in new information and make the
best decision in order to do that we

[3:15:01]
best decision in order to do that we
have to think about what does our
opponent actually have and it's
something that if you're very much into
the GTO way of thinking you're thinking
more of a oh I'm supposed to do this or
supposed to do that and you kind of
forget that your actions are based based
on your opponent's range and sometimes I

[3:15:16]
on your opponent's range and sometimes I
even I also sometimes catch myself doing
that I'm not thinking about my
opponent's range or Tendencies enough
for us as I think should actually be the
first thing to take in consideration
then if the range and the density of
your opponents are very much aligned
with the input that you give to a static

[3:15:30]
with the input that you give to a static
model like a biosolver then obviously
the outcome we should just follow the
outcome but many times that's actually
not very Decay so good reminder think
about what your opponent actually has
okay we're going back to PO poker poker
101 but you know sometimes we we make

[3:15:45]
101 but you know sometimes we we make
things a bit more complicated and then
he also talked about like the future EV
you know that you might follow
equilibrium play that's
Break Even slightly winning and you're
like yeah it's a good play but then you
stand up and you walk through you walk
through the cashier and you see the rest

[3:16:00]
through the cashier and you see the rest
of the tables and how many recreationals
were still left in the future like maybe
I should have taken that in
consideration when making this light
stack off so I thought the the
importance of future EV uh yeah very
very important Point as well
