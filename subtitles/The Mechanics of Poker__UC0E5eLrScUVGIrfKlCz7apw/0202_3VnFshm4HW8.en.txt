[00:00]
basically if you start noling some s you
can justify
anything you mentioned and everyone
knows right yeah you should study to get
better and you've mentioned study so
many times when you say study what what

[00:16]
many times when you say study what what
do you do H how can people study in
order to to go into the future right
what should people study how should
people study and how has your study
process evolved right over over the 15
years you've been playing
poker yeah so I I listened to the couple

[00:32]
poker yeah so I I listened to the couple
podcasts
and I either saw people saying that you
cannot mimic solvers if you study
solvers is [ __ ] and yeah it's
definitely some truth about that and

[00:46]
definitely some truth about that and
there are other players like H you have
to be like super exploitive nothing else
I me basically the same but others like
GTO barding on four tables four hours a
day or something like that and I think

[01:02]
day or something like that and I think
it's it's not that simple either way
that like uh I definitely had my fair
share of staring 10 hours P solver and
felt like didn't learn anything like not

[01:17]
felt like didn't learn anything like not
even a single thing like I try to you
know I created super star super
complicated strategies like I even wrote
down okay this combo you bet 60% or 70%

[01:31]
down okay this combo you bet 60% or 70%
why would I ever do that but I think um
you definitely can study stuff which is
not useful but usually it's much more
complicated and even if you want to

[01:45]
complicated and even if you want to
exploit the [ __ ] out of people you you
have to be watch and look and study a
bunch of soles and just realize how
people uh think and how people play and
I think I was really good at modeling

[02:01]
I think I was really good at modeling
these situations so I would
definitely use solvers a lot but I will
use uh pop Tendencies as well and try to

[02:16]
use uh pop Tendencies as well and try to
like you know create some nice node
loocks uh I I also have a very good U
comparison between tennis and poker what
I have
learned when I go for coaching we always
do like different drills and different

[02:31]
do like different drills and different
stuff and I feel like it's a it's not a
one game Dennis it's not like a one game
it's a multiple different games like if
you are at the net and doing a volley
it's so much different than doing a big

[02:46]
it's so much different than doing a big
shots from from the Baseline and I think
it's the same in poker you have so many
little different games like a a button
cut of three B pot is so much different

[03:00]
cut of three B pot is so much different
than a small blind big blind open race
point so basically you just have to
learn all these different games and
basically it's a collection of games and
you you want to be good at the most
common little games you're going to play

[03:17]
common little games you're going to play
and always it's going to be different a
forbat spot it's so much different you
have to you have to practice all of them
and learn the basics and even if you
even if you just look bio Sims and you

[03:31]
even if you just look bio Sims and you
think you don't learn anything I mean
you have to have to see how it works and
how how is the mechanics mechanics of
shout out to the mechanics yes no but
that's it right you have to go in with

[03:46]
that's it right you have to go in with
that mentality of and that Curiosity of
how does this work instead of tell me
what to do that's kind of the the it's
like really much the mentality with
which you open the solver I think you
also mentioned right that you also Miss
use it when you were trying to implement

[04:01]
use it when you were trying to implement
okay I should bet this 60 70% of the
time and probably you kind of very
quickly realize okay this is probably
not the best way that I should use the
solver you mentioned the more effective
way of using the solver is to compare
like okay this is the equilibrium

[04:15]
like okay this is the equilibrium
strategy we understand why that's its
way we look at population Tendencies put
in the numbers run a note lock I usually
recommend also to maybe note lock slowly
because in in many spots indeed because
the equilibrium so fragile right if we
give it a couple percent more it just
says well just do this 100% of the time

[04:32]
says well just do this 100% of the time
so I usually like to not exaggerate but
like not loock slowly so we can see okay
what kind of other firstand that that
strategies start switching with also at
latest replay we have to kind of
re-evaluate when it comes down to using

[04:45]
re-evaluate when it comes down to using
data to get a better idea of what the
pool is doing right and what the ranges
are what are like effective ways to use
data in your opinion to build strategies
and what are like some traps that people
should look out for for example we

[05:00]
should look out for for example we
talked earlier in this conversation you
had with Adam also about biases and I
feel like especially in data there's a
lot of things that can go wrong can you
maybe share your your
experience yeah so just one more thing
about the the studying and the Not

[05:15]
about the the studying and the Not
Looking uh it's funny I just came
across uh not so long ago that basically
if you start no looking some s you can
justify
anything I I saw a video from a guy uh

[05:30]
anything I I saw a video from a guy uh
doing some I I don't know like middle
position calling a three bet with 86
suited and he's saying okay this is a
pure fault but if you put that and that
into the yeah you can see now it's a

[05:45]
into the yeah you can see now it's a
pure C Yeah so basically they're they're
justifying their decision right yeah
yeah yeah and and he ended up like I
think stabbing the Flop stabbing the
turn and step calling the river and
basically he just said okay I don't

[06:01]
basically he just said okay I don't
think they protect their range so
they're going to just be uh annoyed with
Ace King and like Ace highs and start
putting like turning into Bluffs and
basically he just set everything into

[06:16]
basically he just set everything into
the nodl the way he wanted and obviously
turned out like the super plus CV line
and I was definitely doing this as well
I just realized with an extreme example
that

[06:30]
that
yeah you can you can justify and also in
GTO wizard if you if you do drills like
it's really hard to make a big mistake
like you're gon to usually have these U
uh frequency plays and and it seems like

[06:46]
uh frequency plays and and it seems like
you didn't do big mistakes but maybe you
you did tremendous big mistakes uh but
you just can't see so about the
data uh it's definitely

[07:00]
data uh it's definitely
uh true that you can I I mean there are
some uh spots where you just have to
know have to learn what is a trustable
data and I don't even know how to so

[07:17]
data and I don't even know how to so
sometimes I just see it in a video and I
realize it's true so let give you an
example I was looking at uh pop tendency
calling in the big line and if you if

[07:31]
calling in the big line and if you if
you see if you check a a huge database
you see like everything people call is
super plus CV and I was yeah the
conclusion is just you call everything
because people are not that aggressive

[07:45]
because people are not that aggressive
probably in position and you just get
away with it but then you realize that
if people call 64 off suit you're going
to see a showdown usually when they win
like you're not going to see the 64 suit

[08:00]
like you're not going to see the 64 suit
64 off suit when they folded on the turn
so it's going to be like The Showdown
bias which I wasn't aware of for a
couple years and then I realized yeah
basically the there are showdowns that

[08:17]
basically the there are showdowns that
can be trusted some showdowns cannot be
trusted because of the nature of the way
how it goes to
Showdown and also the uncertainty like
if you have 10 examples maybe as as Adam

[08:32]
if you have 10 examples maybe as as Adam
said maybe it's not uh not good enough
or not precise enough but also you can
you can I I can't remember this uh
mathematical expression but you can

[08:46]
mathematical expression but you can
check the certainty of the number like a
bional something and and basically you
can you can have like a nice uh educated
guas

[09:00]
guas
on is this is this just a a noise in the
data or is this
trustful and yeah uh I I just try to
focus on the on the
useful dat I remember I remember like

[09:16]
useful dat I remember I remember like
before solvers when basically all we had
was data or at least the game was way
more exploitable right because we were
mainly playing on data of other players
and you kind of making strategies on the
Fly remember like sample size issues was
like this guy had a leak and then a

[09:31]
like this guy had a leak and then a
month later he didn't have the leak
anymore but now I realized that probably
it was probably it was just statisticaly
that made the leak go away it's like Oh
I thought he had that leak oh he doesn't
have that leak anymore so yeah there's
definitely some truth in that I do feel
like there is a lot of because poker we

[09:48]
like there is a lot of because poker we
already have little information and I do
feel like if we get some data that's
pointing something in wrong direction I
think if we have to wait until a
confidence interval like 95% certainty

[10:01]
confidence interval like 95% certainty
we missed up on a lot of good plus v
opportunities if we wouldn't have been
that much of a knit in wanting to have
100% certainty of a stat and obviously
also there's ways you can use multiple
stats at all point in the same direction
um but yeah definitely true uh like I

[10:17]
um but yeah definitely true uh like I
said I've definitely Fallen victim of
this uh myself of ignoring kind of uh
sample sizes I do also feel like in data
for example if people only let's say for
example you see a folder spot but it's a

[10:31]
example you see a folder spot but it's a
spot where population itself under
Bluffs that means that the majority of
the times that they face that bet it was
value heavy which blocks calling ranges
therefore full percentages will go up or
people only follow through in like

[10:45]
people only follow through in like
Equity improving scenarios so there's
there's a lot of like it doesn't tell
the same story like I experimented in my
career as well and friends of mine as
well where you just saw one data point
you're like hey data point says so let's
go but you forget that when people arve
that note they're telling a story that

[11:00]
that note they're telling a story that
makes sense and I'm just now arriving at
this note with a story that makes no
sense at all and people are like what
the [ __ ] is this and they call you down
was like well well but the data showed
that they're over folding here with 8%
what the [ __ ] is going on well that's
because I'm telling a [ __ ] story
with a [ __ ] hand so it it is gonna

[11:16]
with a [ __ ] hand so it it is gonna
it is going to screw the data a little
bit ever experienced anything like this
oh yeah man all the time I remember one
of the podcast I just saw you talking
about when people say I'm exploiting the

[11:30]
about when people say I'm exploiting the
Flop over SE betting because they
overfall and then they turn they G to or
or river they think about like what
going to Bluff and what I'm going to
Bluff and why I'm going to overse by the
turn as well and uh yeah she did

[11:47]
turn as well and uh yeah she did
explorative stuff on the on the fluff
like how do you think and even in my
earlier poker careers poker career I
loved when I had the reasoning that

[12:00]
loved when I had the reasoning that
I discounted some hands from his range
on the turn and then add back on the
river like I'm G to get called by that
because I get better hand or something
and it's just completely
ridiculous yeah I definitely uh had

[12:18]
ridiculous yeah I definitely uh had
problems with that and and I I think I
you just have to learn with the data
that some some things I'm not not going
to be that useful and you not you cannot

[12:32]
to be that useful and you not you cannot
be that sure and I also saw like very
weird
examples
when people overfall turn and you do the
nod loock and then you realize they

[12:47]
nod loock and then you realize they
still going to be overflooding even even
by the river and it's just so insane
that you you you would think if you did
your exploitive stuff on the Flop then
it's over because it's just so much

[13:01]
it's over because it's just so much
stronger range but then you realize oh
my God they still should have called
like this week hands on a certain run
out so it could be
really

[13:15]
really
um it could be really in
unexpected when when you work with data
and uh you just you just have to be
really careful and mindful uh what you
you're going to try like I remember I

[13:33]
you're going to try like I remember I
started playing heads up again um one or
yeah one year ago and I just I just met
the guy who was like so freaking
aggressive I just decided that you you

[13:48]
aggressive I just decided that you you
can call down this guy with anything and
it would be okay and then I just call
down second perers kicker like even
blocking his Bluffs like to 250 big

[14:00]
blocking his Bluffs like to 250 big
blind deep and of course he was just
very betting super te and I got
destroyed and you you have to be really
careful about even how how sick you're
going to exploit

[14:15]
going to exploit
because if somebody sees you doing that
big of an adjustment they they're going
to just stop do it and and you they're
going to crush you so it's many many
times it's not just simple that you just

[14:31]
times it's not just simple that you just
change in one or zero or a or b i
remember um the Stefan challenge against
toti
88 and I think toti had this same

[14:46]
88 and I think toti had this same
attitude I had many times that okay
Stefan equals bluffing all the time what
should I do Co all the it's it it's way
more difficult than that and you just
you just cannot call

[15:02]
you just cannot call
down second pairs on a on a flush
present stuff like that so you have to
be really really careful and uh I I I
was watching the your podcast with Matt

[15:16]
was watching the your podcast with Matt
Marinelli and if you check his graph and
and stuff like that he he looks like the
most exed people person you can imagine
and it was interesting from him hearing

[15:30]
and it was interesting from him hearing
that he tries
to exploit like very slowly like bit by
bit and yeah I think it it makes sense
it there are some rare rare occasions
when you can go full exploit but usually

[15:45]
when you can go full exploit but usually
you have to be careful because you you
never
know uh and and yeah with the data is
the same I think you have to be really
careful especially when it's something
on the River on a single Ray spot like
three three after three bar your

[16:01]
three three after three bar your
Showdown is going to be I mean much less
um comp Rel yeah reliable
