[00:01]
um

[00:35]
yes

[01:03]
oh now it's good
that's good change

[01:21]
layer one alum

[01:34]
that's a good
we speak we say it's a magician the
mission level no it's a very good area

[01:46]
mission level no it's a very good area
for sure
it's not

[02:19]
all right

[02:47]
is

[03:00]
welcome guys to this very first episode
of the monthly recap in which we will
reflect on my month and see what went
well what could have gone a little bit
better and if this month brought us
closer to our goals yes or no the

[03:15]
closer to our goals yes or no the
monthly recap is going to be part of the
new content program we've made for the
poker ambition channel next to this we
have started the mechanics of poker
podcast which now counts three episodes
which are being very well received and

[03:31]
which are being very well received and
it's something that me and my co-host
adam really enjoy doing so make sure to
subscribe follow etc on youtube spotify
and apple as we have already recorded
two episodes and we have many more to

[03:45]
two episodes and we have many more to
follow with guests that you don't want
to miss for my loyal twitch fans i have
a little bit of bad news you probably
already noticed but i've been taking a
break from twitch as i'm not really
enjoying it anymore in the beginning
streaming was definitely something that

[04:00]
streaming was definitely something that
i always enjoyed doing and was looking
forward to doing but now when i had a
stream session planned i was kind of
looking up to doing it and usually when
something like that happens in my life
it's time to change things up in the
beginning of streaming i felt like i

[04:16]
beginning of streaming i felt like i
could bring something different to the
streaming world and there were a lot of
views that i had on playing poker and
being a poker professional that i wanted
to share with the audience however now i
feel like i've shared most of what i
wanted to share and i feel like i'm just

[04:30]
wanted to share and i feel like i'm just
repeating myself
also it started to feel less authentic
as what i really love about poker is to
dive deep into poker strategy and share
my thoughts on how i view the game
however
next to twitch we have poker programs in

[04:46]
next to twitch we have poker programs in
which people actually pay money to get
coaching from me so it wouldn't really
be fair of me towards them to just share
everything that i know on twitch for
free this left me to kind of play not
handcuffed but sort of mouth cuffed if

[05:01]
handcuffed but sort of mouth cuffed if
that is a word and it kind of took away
the enjoyment and made the channel a
little bit to gto blocker on blocker and
in general far from how i actually play
poker

[05:15]
poker
now no worries there will still be
content as i will be making plain
explained videos here on youtube in
which i can focus on educating you guys
on a certain concepts that i think are
going to be educational to your game the
next tip i want to tell you about is

[05:31]
next tip i want to tell you about is
what i consider to be my strongest
weapon in no limit taxes holding
it's called the flat call
so january the start of the week did not

[05:45]
so january the start of the week did not
go as planned as i tested positive on
covet luckily for me i didn't really
have much symptoms and i already planned
on using the first week of the month to
reflect on a list of questions that i
put together for our academy webinar on

[06:02]
put together for our academy webinar on
how to make this year your greatest year
ever it is actually for free available
on our site poker ambition.com so go
over to the site click on the free
webinar make sure to check that out a
couple of things that came out of the

[06:15]
couple of things that came out of the
reflection for me were indeed the change
in content strategy here at poker
ambition the goals that i wanted to
achieve for this year and why they were
important to me and what i would have to
do consistently in order to reach them

[06:30]
do consistently in order to reach them
for example i want to play around 150k
hands of online poker this year with an
average stake of around two and a half k
that means that i will have to roughly
play 15k hands a month and in general
play more 5k games to up my average
stake another goal for me is to release

[06:47]
stake another goal for me is to release
four new master classes this year and
release the big update that i've been
working on for the mechanics of poker
program this equals to roughly releasing
a new master class and once every two
months and it takes me around two maybe

[07:02]
months and it takes me around two maybe
even three weeks to make them meaning
that every month i should spend at least
one week preferably one and a half week
on making coaching content but going
back to how january started every first

[07:15]
back to how january started every first
week of the month on wednesday we have
the live q a call that comes with the
mechanics of poker program in which this
time we decided to talk about what i
consider to be a punt and how to prevent
punting around this question was

[07:30]
punting around this question was
inspired by one of our mechanics members
who joined the end of the year webinar
on how to become a more successful poker
player in which i was talking about the
differences between mid and high six
players and i said that high six players
in general punt less than mid stakes

[07:45]
in general punt less than mid stakes
players
so i'm gonna start the at the top and
then we can talk about the all points
and then if we went to all points we can
take a look at the hands that you played
and this is why in the decision making
process is very important in my opinion
to start your decision making process
with who is he

[08:00]
with who is he
if he's extreme to the left or extreme
to the right
often you get a question yeah he's just
a wreck you know it's not an extreme
station but not also an extreme knit
then obviously we can play the hand a
bit more gto than other things like
blockers and stuff start to matter more

[08:16]
blockers and stuff start to matter more
but versus extreme knits we know who
have a river bet oh in one dollar
children of 70 for example yeah they're
they're just not bluffing enough
right
because 71 dollar showdown you know
sometimes they get called that

[08:31]
sometimes they get called that
didn't have a bluff is the loss so they
maybe are bluffing 20 18
when they go and
yeah that's not a good idea so if you
don't beat their value you shouldn't
fall you shouldn't call
and any at just any spot just general

[08:45]
and any at just any spot just general
and like i said the rdmp that i
explained avoid the strong cycle what's
weak is just
all data combined basically trends that
you see and you can yeah open any spot
that you want and you can look at these
points and you always see these points
coming back

[09:00]
coming back
right so i'm a big fan that instead of
trying to memorize all bluffing
frequencies in all spots i'm more of a
big fan of again the moralistic approach
trying to understand why
and using that same philosophy in all
spots you cannot have the same decision

[09:16]
spots you cannot have the same decision
making process
when someone goes bad bad bad as when
someone goes check check back so
multi-street aggression so if someone
faces but for example in theory if you
look at the solver the way he constructs

[09:30]
look at the solver the way he constructs
his range and the way he plays a spot in
check check bet or better bet he takes
the same things into consideration for
him the decision-making process is the
same but for us it should not be the
right
yeah uh same lack of natural loss
incentive to keep uploading for example

[09:45]
incentive to keep uploading for example
eight high ports
so
uh again this is more like the
decision-making process and if you if if
i would highly recommend
if you don't feel like you do this well
enough in-game i would really make that
a conscious focus point

[10:00]
a conscious focus point
go go to the to the avoid strong strike
what's weak section again in the
mechanics
list the point and make that priority to
ever every river decision okay top of
mind
so again to go a bit more to like
decision making process it's not about

[10:15]
decision making process it's not about
what we should do or have to do which is
more like the gto mindset but think for
yourself what is his range what does he
have is he strong or is he weak and
continue accordingly aka make the
highest ifv decision
the second week of january i was still

[10:30]
the second week of january i was still
feeling a bit slow from the covet a bit
tired that wasn't a hundred percent my
brain wasn't really working yet so i
decided to spend that week on working on
the master class we have recently
released the small blind versus big
blind muscle glass so make sure to go
check that out and the master class i'm

[10:46]
check that out and the master class i'm
working on now is playing out of
position versus a three bat which is
going to include the lines playing as
the caller out of position in three by
pots and playing as the four better out
of position in four bet pots i've
completed the presentation and separated

[11:00]
completed the presentation and separated
all the simulations that i want to
discuss as collar out of position in the
three by pot and let me quickly share
with you guys a little spoiler on how
that looks
so playing out of position facing a
three bet the new master class
what are we going to discuss

[11:16]
what are we going to discuss
we're going to obviously talk about
pre-flop how epmp cutoff spots are
different than small bite versus big
blind
adjustments in sizing we talk about some
population stuff then we'll go over
three weapons out of position as the
color in general we usually talk do a

[11:32]
color in general we usually talk do a
little introduction about some post-hop
concepts we compare a lot the difference
between ep and picada versus small blind
and kind of the nature of the spot the
nature of the spot kind of changes as we
are ep versus mp and end up playing

[11:45]
are ep versus mp and end up playing
smaller versus big night for example so
a lot of difference in there we're gonna
talk about all boards all lines
then
indeed here point three facing different
lines as color out of position we face a
c bet after check calling check raising
what we do facing a check back then

[12:00]
what we do facing a check back then
we'll talk about four by pots out of
position as initial razor again post-op
introduction nature of the spot
comparing the epmp versus small blind
how are the range is different how does
that impact our strategy we'll look at
the c bet strategies for textures

[12:15]
the c bet strategies for textures
and then in the end we'll sum it up with
a little main takeaway
a little spoiler alert for pre-flop size
matters i know you've heard this before
but important to repeat it again
understand and play by the nature of the
spot this is very important in defense

[12:30]
spot this is very important in defense
spots and generalize we're trying to
lose less than folding
and
i wrote down ep to cut off both preflop
and post up we will often be far behind
the tree bearers range causing us to
overfold and there's nothing we can do
about it okay and a little hashtag b

[12:46]
about it okay and a little hashtag b
come a good loser
okay
smaller first big brand however equities
are way more divided due to vidin's
polar tree betting range we get to
realize more due to less flopsy betting
and get to call more versus bets as they

[13:00]
and get to call more versus bets as they
contain less equity so this is kind of
the nature of the spot
little reminder remember this losing the
minimum is also winning very important
in this spot
like always in all master classes we
look at all the sims all the textures i

[13:17]
look at all the sims all the textures i
explain you guys why a solver prefers
certain strategies what is the idea
behind it and then we always look at
population tendencies as well how can we
exploit what the population is doing
it's a very important part of your

[13:30]
it's a very important part of your
baseline strategy
then we'll look at some note locks
and what the correct counter strategies
would look like and also a master class
is not complete without a dunking
section we're going to be talking about
flop dunking turn dunking river dunking
you know i love dunking so obviously

[13:46]
you know i love dunking so obviously
that is included as well
we'll look at some bluff catching versus
barrels which you know is a spot that
i'm sure a lot of you guys have trouble
with you face aggression what to do i
will answer that obviously we'll look
again we'll look at it from a theory

[14:01]
again we'll look at it from a theory
perspective but most importantly in
these kind of scenarios from a
population perspective as well
what leads to another bluff spot what
leads to an over bluff spot take a look
at data i'll explain you guys why the
data shows what it shows so we can

[14:15]
data shows what it shows so we can
better understand it again i'm a big
advocate of why why why rivers in the
check call check line very important
question that always comes back in all
my content where should our value come
from again we compare how ep versus mp
plays different and color versus bottom
then plays different than smallmouth

[14:30]
then plays different than smallmouth
versus big blind on a king nine eight
four deuce i used as an example here we
can see that we do quite a lot of
checking
we do last checking color versus button
and here actually you see we do a lot of
small betting right here that kind of
disappears if you look at for example i
had like pocket tents

[14:45]
had like pocket tents
and pocket jacks usually want to check
in early positions and they want to bet
in later positions and i'll explain you
guys and in the end go over a [ __ ] ton
of hand history examples to really bring
the point home during this week i
received a message about a possibility

[15:01]
received a message about a possibility
of playing in jovery rouse game which is
a live poker cash game here in malta in
which you are playing 2550 with a
minimum buying of 10k and with a very
common straddle to a hundred so it's
basically 25 50 100 with various sites

[15:16]
basically 25 50 100 with various sites
games which i think i've discussed in an
earlier video go scroll down somewhere
here on youtube where they play the
seven news game the a3 of game bomb bots
stand-up game you name it overall great
fun to play so i went over to my bedroom

[15:30]
fun to play so i went over to my bedroom
flipped over my mattress to see if i had
some money laying around i was lucky
enough to find something so we decided
to hop into the game i ended up playing
friday saturday and sunday and as the
hands in the intro of this video already

[15:45]
hands in the intro of this video already
suggested it did not go so well
now obviously when you lose big in a
small sample there's gonna be a lot of
luck involved however also i don't think

[16:00]
luck involved however also i don't think
my approach to this game was very good
we actually had a guest on earlier in
the mechanics of poker podcast who gave
some valuable tips to online players
going to play live poker um and i think
that like holding holding rigid ideas of

[16:15]
that like holding holding rigid ideas of
what your opponent should be doing is
the main mistake that people make when
they're playing live like get that get
that thought of your head like well my
opponent should have this and this and
this and like no he doesn't he has this
he has nothing even close to that he
wasn't even thinking about that he was
checking out the waitress's ass he

[16:30]
checking out the waitress's ass he
doesn't know what range he has like just
just play your game you know like it's
people people try to do too much i would
say and like attribute too much and try
to implement too much and it's
a lot of playing live low stakes is just

[16:45]
a lot of playing live low stakes is just
playing like good simple solid poker now
i should have listened to mr jarrod man
as he's a very wise poker player
but instead of that i noticed
unconsciously reflecting afterwards that
i came into the game with the mentality
to exploit my opponents as i was sure

[17:03]
to exploit my opponents as i was sure
that they were playing some optimal now
there's obviously a couple of problems
that can come with this first of all
you're gonna make assumptions on how you
think they're playing so basically
you're trying to mind read your opponent

[17:16]
you're trying to mind read your opponent
and if you're wrong you can make big
blunders okay in general if you just
focus on playing your strategy as
actually in the podcast with jaredman
was explained very well so if you want
to know more about that go check that
out but basically we talked about how if
you just play solid a solid strategy aka

[17:33]
you just play solid a solid strategy aka
gto
the fact that your opponents are playing
a soft optimal strategy means that you
are making money however i guess i felt
a little bit entitled or i felt like i
should do something special exactly what

[17:45]
should do something special exactly what
jaredman told me not to do
as i was seeing people make mistakes
left and right so i felt like i should
make way more than gto so after this
weekend of live poker i decided to take
the monday off
before tuesday going back to work this

[18:00]
before tuesday going back to work this
time listening to the advice of jeremiah
very carefully i'm curious like if you
if you go play live and you play very
big and then you go back to canada and
you play
significantly lower like
it's very hard to to make up for those
losses playing max 2k online how do you

[18:16]
losses playing max 2k online how do you
deal with that mentally how do you
switch yeah so
yeah you have to get rid of the the
mindset of winning it back that's like
the first thing you need to lose as a
poker player is the mindset of trying to
win something back like that money's
gone it's you don't have it anymore you

[18:30]
gone it's you don't have it anymore you
can't win it back it's gone like so the
rest of the month i've just been focused
on getting back into the online grind
and we ended up playing around 10 000
hands which given how the first two
weeks of january went i think is okay
unfortunately we didn't play much higher

[18:46]
unfortunately we didn't play much higher
stakes than 2k and the times that we did
play 3k or 5k in this case unfortunately
luck didn't go our way as well now once
every three months in this monthly recap
i will share my results over those last
three months with you guys i will also

[19:01]
three months with you guys i will also
show you guys how i will analyze my
results maybe look at how variants
impacted my game and how we can use
information that we gathered in those
three months to make sure that the next
three months are gonna be better than
the last three months as i think over a

[19:17]
the last three months as i think over a
shorter sample
like this month ten thousand hands
results don't really say [ __ ] i do still
think it's important to look at your
statistics and how you played to see if
at least strategic-wise you are not
starting to leak in certain spots within

[19:31]
starting to leak in certain spots within
these two weeks i also hopped into our
poker ambition academy to give a webinar
on the pros and cons of using mda aka
using population data let's get it
started questions always welcome anytime

[19:47]
started questions always welcome anytime
just write it in chat and now
and i'll reply
so working with population data that's i
kind of rephrased it the pros and cons
of mda because basically mda stands for

[20:00]
of mda because basically mda stands for
mass database analysis
but basically
it's just working with population data
often when we talk about mass database
analysis we're talking about mass data
so a lot of data but even with little
data you can already

[20:16]
data you can already
form an alias on which you can do
population research
the main purpose of why
you in my opinion should
use
population data
is to get a non-biased view of what the

[20:31]
is to get a non-biased view of what the
poo is really doing instead of basing it
on intuition
now you know before i get charlie
carroll on my back
i have nothing against intuition right i
think especially you know when you're
playing well your intuition should have

[20:45]
playing well your intuition should have
a place in your decision making process
however
a lot of people's intuition is biased
us humans we are very sensitive to bias
there's a book
thinking fast and slow from i think
daniel pink which is definitely worth a

[21:00]
daniel pink which is definitely worth a
read as a poker player
to
make you better understand the impact
biases have on your decision making
process
when studying gto
you might sometimes get the feeling that
this doesn't happen in my pool okay you

[21:17]
this doesn't happen in my pool okay you
go through the solver here what the [ __ ]
is the solver doing oh he's doing this
yeah but this never happens and you're a
little bit frustrated but actually
that's a good thing because as soon as
you look at the solver and you feel like
hey
so this is apparently what is gto but

[21:31]
so this is apparently what is gto but
hey i don't really feel like this
happens in my poo this is your intuition
right
now you should not end there you should
write down this intuition
okay maybe for example when i play a
hand then my intuition says something
like hey this feels like an under bluff

[21:45]
like hey this feels like an under bluff
spot or this feels like a spot that i
don't want to follow through my bluff or
this feels like a spot i want to over
bluff i might write down that situation
and having a an alias of your population
in your tracker like all the manager
hand to notes to fall back to to analyze

[22:00]
hand to notes to fall back to to analyze
if that
intuition was indeed correct is very
valuable
so by creating an alias of your
population
or a certain profile of opponents you
can look up the data to see if this
intuition is correct or biased

[22:18]
intuition is correct or biased
so i will go into
a couple of pros
of why we should use why we should
analyze data
and this kind of goes hand in hand with
the point above it gives you a lot of

[22:31]
the point above it gives you a lot of
confidence certainty
and the more confident we are in
something the more certain we are the
less doubt and the more we can pull the
trigger
and it makes it easy to do hero calling
your unfolding why is hero folding so

[22:45]
your unfolding why is hero folding so
differ difficult
because there's uncertainty we don't
know and if we call we at least know
right we we we get the confirmation
the more you've seen the data the more
confirmation you have okay of some

[23:00]
confirmation you have okay of some
somewhere you know there's just ten
percent more folding than what should be
going on if you recognize that spot you
have no problem whatsoever to pull the
trigger
because your certainty of the spot is
higher
okay

[23:16]
okay
and the same for hero calling here
folding
after you made the call after you made
the fold you don't feel bad about it
because you've seen the data you've seen
the proof
[Music]
so overall i'm happy with the planning

[23:31]
so overall i'm happy with the planning
and reflecting we did in the first week
of january i'm really looking forward to
becoming a better poker player a better
poker coach and a better content creator
slash podcast interviewer even though
the results in the live game that we

[23:45]
the results in the live game that we
played didn't really go that well i do
feel like it was a necessary experience
to get in in order to get become better
at playing live poker in the end how do
you learn is to throw yourself in this
situation reflect on it and see what you
can do better next time now obviously i

[24:01]
can do better next time now obviously i
would prefer to play a smaller prize for
these lessons however the next time we
go and play live i do think we will be
playing a little bit more of a german
approved live game strategy overall
playing wise i am definitely seeing new

[24:15]
playing wise i am definitely seeing new
spots that i haven't seen before due to
gaining new knowledge i'm also seeing
myself not making mistakes that i was
previously making
so in general i see improvements in my
game which i'm really happy about in the
live game i do think i played some hands

[24:30]
live game i do think i played some hands
very well however they were all smaller
pots involved like some dunking and
involved some seven dusek routine wise i
had the goal of being more consistent in
my meditation habit and i decided to put
that after my stretching habit that i
have in the morning we didn't do it all

[24:47]
have in the morning we didn't do it all
of the days but i'm decently happy with
how things are going in that area pre
and post session i think i've been very
disciplined i don't think i've played a
session without doing some sort of
breathing or visualization before

[25:00]
breathing or visualization before
playing and after my session i've always
went through all the hands that i played
and overall i think we've gathered some
solid information about root causes of
mistakes now this is just like an
earlier example we're using mistakes
actually as something positive because

[25:15]
actually as something positive because
mistakes are going to happen and how you
respond to these mistakes and what you
what kind of lessons you will take from
these mistakes are essentially the most
important things and are going to
differentiate you from other poker
players

[25:30]
now i'm reflecting on my stats for the
month like i said that it's something
that i do do monthly and i think it's
very important i did notice the pattern
that has been consistent throughout my
poker career which is leading to play a
bit to passive pre-flop and in some

[25:45]
bit to passive pre-flop and in some
spots post flop pre-flop especially
every time when i have the option to
call or three bats or call or four bat
or call or five bet i usually lean
towards the passive side a bit too often
this is caused by
the fact that i don't want to not see a

[26:01]
the fact that i don't want to not see a
flop i'm that type of player i want to
first see the flop before getting funky
because you can have a skin but hey you
don't know what the flop is going to
bring right
however there's obviously a lot of flaws
in that logic and in general unless you
have an absolute premium you usually

[26:16]
have an absolute premium you usually
don't outperform the winnings that you
get from getting a pre-flop fold now in
order to fix this i've been re-studying
all the pre-flop charts and went through
my database to recognize certain spots
where i'm indeed leaking this pretty
frog progression another common mistake

[26:31]
frog progression another common mistake
is sort of overly slow playing or
playing certain strong hands too
passively on the flop especially when
the board gets more connected i will
show you guys an example of that but ace
king on the button cut off calls c flop

[26:46]
king on the button cut off calls c flop
of ace four seven two tone
i
see that one third villain calls
turn
our opponent checks and i check behind
okay let's look in a solver

[27:01]
okay let's look in a solver
how the spot is actually supposed to be
played let's start actually on the flop
it's another very high c bet frequency
almost half of the time definitely a
spot for example because i looked a lot
at how to play out of position as color

[27:16]
at how to play out of position as color
and usually you then also look at okay
how does imposition play both in theory
and
in practice okay and you learn a lot
from that so i already knew this is not
necessarily a range see that board for
me but ace king as you can see
definitely a high c bet frequency so i

[27:31]
definitely a high c bet frequency so i
started with a bumper but villain will
have to do quite some folding for
example and like pocket eights i think
is a good example pocket nines if they
don't have the back door they're not
really happy calling
um it's not as bad as if we were playing

[27:46]
um it's not as bad as if we were playing
ep versus mp there you for example with
already full pocket tents quite extreme
you should also do some raising but he
calls
turn is an eight

[28:00]
very little to no dunking we check
and we can see here that ace king is
mainly batting okay a screen is your
potential check and ace jackers are
always checked because obviously you
know your opponent can have a screen
but often in these kind of scenarios are

[28:15]
but often in these kind of scenarios are
kind of over downplayed at turn now i'm
not saying that's necessarily terrible
right i mean it's checking with some
sort of frequency
uh and depending also on what you think
on later streets your opponent is going
to do maybe he will over bluff you

[28:30]
to do maybe he will over bluff you
because he thinks you're capped for
example there's certain benefits but
these were not the reasons why i checked
obviously you know they play in my mind
but mainly i check to the connectivity
of the board
because i don't want to bat and make
our opponents continue race quite strong

[28:47]
our opponents continue race quite strong
mainly in the para plus draw region but
the point that i often miss
and this is why i said that i'm
overplaying this concept is let's say we
do barrel he's actually folding six and
fives on the turn

[29:00]
fives on the turn
if you can make him fold the high equity
hand like a gutter and a set draw that's
actually a great result and this usually
happens on gutter heavy boards for
example actually i run the same board
and now we made it open ender and double
flush draw and we can see that a screen

[29:16]
flush draw and we can see that a screen
is now pure almost pure checking and ace
king starts to check way more often as
well because obviously if we now bat
our equity versus the container range is
way worse because he's continuing with
more flush draws he has way more open

[29:30]
more flush draws he has way more open
enders he has probably more sets more
two pairs and he's folding a screen at a
higher frequency okay
so obviously the concept applies uh i am
aware of the concept
but i sometimes have the tendency to
over apply it
so i went check check

[29:46]
so i went check check
feeling checked i bet at the river and
let's say for example if you think that
villain will now get out of line with
six s fives with a club and just jam it
in i don't know how often he is supposed
to do that let's see let's go to the sim

[30:00]
to do that let's see let's go to the sim
check check
river ten of clubs
you should actually probably now bluff
them maybe some of the time
very little some of the time check
i assume we're just value betting ace
king especially with the club yes

[30:16]
king especially with the club yes
let's say we go for a medium sizing
six and five should not be bluffed okay
so if you think your opponent might now
over attack the fact that you're capped
then obviously you know checking the

[30:30]
then obviously you know checking the
turn in order to induce a bluff on the
river uh is great i was not intending to
fault
as i do think you know it's a spot that
can easily get attacked ace king with a
club also in gto is just not a fault
because obviously you know we're
blocking the nut flushes and finland

[30:46]
blocking the nut flushes and finland
will have some potential bluffs that we
are
unblocking the other example
i have pocket queens three by big blind
versus small blind you see a very good
flop three four four rainbow a bit half
pot you could even maybe go bigger but

[31:01]
pot you could even maybe go bigger but
half ball is kind of my default turn
again connectivity increase flusher
brings to the board and i check behind
so we indeed see the half pot seabed
being the most dominant sizing as i kind
of already predicted

[31:16]
of already predicted
i bet finland will still have to peel
quite some high guard especially the
ones with some back doors
um you can already start raising some
pairs especially uh i had like sixes

[31:32]
so there's a five no dunking for out of
position
and here we can see barreling
frequencies for imposition nine stance
aces

[31:45]
aces
let's look at queens first and we can
see that queens
again yes it checks some of the time but
again i'm talking about a leak that i
have that i
kind of magnify that little check when
boards become a bit more connected um
also in this case i did have the queen

[32:00]
also in this case i did have the queen
usually when you have the diamond i mean
there's less hands to get value from
because that's it for example we bet
the hand that's going to call you is for
example queen jack of diamonds queen 10
of diamonds king queen and diamond so
usually if you have a diamond you're
more likely to check
um

[32:15]
um
i think yeah with kings here i think
this shows that concept well if you have
the king in diamonds you can see that
king of hearts king and diamond is
exactly as it wants to checks the most
that's because the king of diamonds we
block some of the hands that we want to
get value from and with the king of
hearts we're unblocking the floats like

[32:31]
hearts we're unblocking the floats like
king jack
suited king 10 suited float
clubs diamond spades all right
so we and obviously king jack of clubs
has zero percent equity versus kings so
that's why

[32:45]
that's why
this exact kings like to check and with
aces will probably see something similar
but queens in my opinion again is just a
little bit over applying the concept
okay
because again i thought if i bet you

[33:00]
because again i thought if i bet you
know basically always continue range
will contain a lot of equity but i
forgot i guess about these pairs that
obviously there's an argument to be made
for action killers
and this is very important we actually
again make him fold out equity just like

[33:15]
again make him fold out equity just like
in the other example
finland has a gutter with an over
roughly 15 equity we can fold out and we
can get a lot of value now versus worst
hands so betting is just the best best
strategy now obviously again if we have
aces

[33:30]
aces
ajax has less equity so that's why we
check
especially with the heart and diamond
combo so this is something that you know
it's a bit more top of mind the question
that i now ask myself is
by continuing betting or by using a

[33:45]
by continuing betting or by using a
bigger sizing because sometimes also
overly downsizing these situations
with a bigger bat or with betting in
general can i fold out higher
higher equity hands of my opponents if
the answer is yes i try to be a bit more
aggressive and bigger more often in

[34:01]
aggressive and bigger more often in
these spots
morning routine rises stretching
meditation i noticed the trend that when
i go out of bed too late i can feel a
little bit too hasty and rushy towards
getting on with my day and then

[34:15]
getting on with my day and then
making me skip
my morning routines now obviously i
could then put an alarm clock and get
out of bed earlier however i think the
problem is usually the night before if i
just go to bed on time i don't have this
problem so this is something that i
think i should improve upon coming

[34:31]
think i should improve upon coming
months being a bit more disciplined in
the time that i go to bed
[Music]
now obviously starting off the year
losing 60k dollar when you're taking a
shot is not ideal but in the end i'm

[34:46]
shot is not ideal but in the end i'm
behind all my decisions for the games
that i decided to play in which in the
end is the most important thing and it's
in line with my goals since upping my
average stake was part of my objective
same goes for the mistakes and flaws i
spotted in my game obviously would have

[35:01]
spotted in my game obviously would have
preferred not to make them but i do
think we're learning from them and i'm
seeing some improvements i also didn't
really get much outside feedback and
discuss poker with other poker players
which is something that i think we
should be looking to improve upon going
forward but in general i would say that

[35:16]
forward but in general i would say that
i'm content with how january went
overall happy with the progress we made
as a poker player happy with the
progress we made in poker mission
[Music]
so overall i would give this month a
seven and i do think it brought me

[35:30]
seven and i do think it brought me
closer to my goals however we shouldn't
be overly positive as a seven isn't that
great so next month we should at least
aim to score higher than a seven
so some focus point for upcoming month

[35:46]
so some focus point for upcoming month
be more disciplined in the time that we
go to bed so our morning routine of
stretching and meditation sticks getting
in these 15k hands that we want to play
with extra focus on reducing our bias of
being to passive pre and post flop and

[36:01]
being to passive pre and post flop and
when we reach the goal of playing 50k
hands
continuing on the master class on facing
a three bet went off position continuing
