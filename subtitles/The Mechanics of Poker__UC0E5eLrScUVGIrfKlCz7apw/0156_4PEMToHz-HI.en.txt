hi there my fellow ambitious poker
players welcome back to another episode
of the mechanics of poker podcast today
we are going to have a conversation with
julian gvr star shul tice julian is a
high-stakes online cash game player who
has been playing poker for over 12 years
just like many others we had on the
podcast he was very competitive from a
young age in both computer games and
sports and mentioned that the work ethic
needed to succeed in those areas is very
similar to poker so i'm very curious to
see what those are adam thanks for
joining me again today
what are you excited for to talk about
with today's guests
yeah i'm super excited to dig into this
12-year journey hopefully there's a lot
of nuggets to unpack for all the
audience and when you take a long time
to reach a goal generally you've had to
overcome a lot of challenges and
adversity and i think as the listener
hopefully they'll relate to a lot of the
problems i guess has gone through and
how he's been able to overcome them also
12 years takes a lot of resilience a lot
of motivation endurance to get to uh the
top of your field it takes a long time
to commit to that so yeah really
intrigued to uh see what challenges he
went through and what kind of skills
he's had to build in order to overcome
the obstacles he's faced how about
yourself renee what are you most looking
forward to to get into
yeah
as as as i think you were referring to
it took him 12 years to get to high
stakes which is very long compared to
some other guests he also mentioned that
he believes you can succeed at anything
you put your mind to it's a similar
mindset that i have so he thinks that
you know talent is a little bit
overrated in that regards and i guess
he learned that true experience
so yeah very curious to get into it

conversation
good morning julian my point we get
good
concepts
okay that's the only journey you're
gonna get from me i assume you ask how
i'm doing so i would say it gets good as
well
so good
okay okay i passed the german dust great
uh
julian there's uh very happy to have you
on thank you for coming on yes thanks
for having me thank you this is
where we can start this podcast
being the gvl star in 69 i think it's
pretty pretty self-explanatory right
uh you mentioned to me that it was from
the song the summer of 69 and i'm sure
that
that's exactly what all the listeners
thought as well no but i wanted to start
at the beginning and your first
encounter with that competitive side in
you
um
that came out when playing video games
and football could you
walk us through that time and when you
noticed you were being more competitive
than the other children
and why you think
competing is so rewarding for you
yeah so when i look back i was always
like a little play child it started with
like these tv consoles like nintendo 64
playstation and like when i played there
i always played and i played all day and
when a friend came over and i played
against a friend i always needed to beat
them and when i didn't beat them i was
like freaking out i was freaking out the
controllers went through the room and
like i always made sure when my friends
came back that i beat them another day
or they gave me a new game and i said
i'm not gonna quit here until i finished
the game or remember i was mario kart or
was it yeah diddy kong racing or
whatever on 64. i don't know i was
playing it through in eight hours or
something like that when i was 10 years
old so there's always been like very
competitive and then when i got older
i got into counter-strike
and uh basically played counter-strike
uh online like we had the first fast
internet back in germany because i was
living on a village and uh yeah whenever
i was like school was off or when uh it
was like holiday of school i just played
like non-stop like curtains closed uh
lights out put some drinks and some food
next to my computer and just like
started playing and playing and playing
and always wanted to get better i always
wanted to improve and then yeah i
started to play i believe it was called
esl like electronic sports league and
started playing in there with a friend
like a two or two league and a five on
five league and then um yeah by the end
we played some amateur
series as well and uh yeah basically
gaming or being competitive and like
having the drive and ambition to get
better at something that was always it
always has been there
and um yeah when i was 16
um i started to take football more
serious i remember like the coach from
the senior team he asked me if i didn't
because i was a goalkeeper and they were
short of goalkeepers so if you want to
have like a good training uh you need
two goalkeepers and i only had one and
then he took me when i was 16 he took me
all into the seniors team and then i
just started training all day like five
days a week i played one match in the
second team on the weekend and then for
the first team i did the sub uh
or like was on a bench as a sub
so yeah like it has been like a long two
years of just like grinding football and
actually my dream was always to become
professional football player or like
professional goalkeeper but uh yeah in
the end i didn't make it i played like
one match the fifth league in germany
and i started to make a little bit of
money from it
but like i couldn't get any further and
i was also a bit of like a tough child
like when i was young it wasn't easy i
wasn't really easy going i was always
this on fourth
i would say in a sense like the rebel
the provocative guy and yeah my trainers
and like
the people in the management they they
couldn't cope too much with me and um
yeah that's when i basically discovered
poker when i was like 17 or 18 years old
all right
is it is it you mentioned that the
gaming this sounds very familiar uh i
used to go over to a friend of mine and
that guy was way more competitive
minding he hated losing and then we
would start off playing stratego
stratego what's the english word for
that is that the na you know where you
have like the marshall you put your
bombs and you have to capture the flag
what's the english word for this game
oh god i can't remember i couldn't tell
so for the people who are interested
look it up but we would play that game
and then he would lose in that and then
he would bring out the ping pong table
then we would play and that lose that i
think we started playing a little bit
poker as well heads up sitting goes yeah
and afterwards we would play fifa and if
he would lose he would just kick me out
of the house
so it sounds very familiar i was never i
was never that much of a sore loser i
didn't like to lose i like to compete i
like to play games but he was very a
very sort of loser you you
more hated the feeling of losing
is that just the feeling that you wanted
to avoid
it's i don't know it was like very
emotional uh in a sense and like very
how can i say i didn't like losing like
the feeling of losing it wasn't right
for me like i needed to win to feel good
and i wanted to be better than the other
one and you have this feeling like you
want to be superior you want to be
superior and like losing i couldn't take
it like i said i throw out controllers i
broke the keyboard i broke my mouses i i
don't know at one point while playing
poker i smashed a hole into my screen
and stuff like it was like a very very
um yeah competitive well obviously poker
doesn't really serve you when you're
that emotional like in general yes you
need this drive you need this ambition
but if it's taking over too much and
you're getting too emotional all the
time it also doesn't doesn't serve you
really in the long run right
does the moment stick out to you when
you were in your poker career and you
realized this because now you realize
that you know that sometimes too much
emotions of being too competitive didn't
serve you do you remember
a certain moment in your poke career
where you were like
okay this has to change
yeah it was the first time so i was
still playing in germany on the side
while i was studying and then like i had
like a good balance of life so i was
going to uni i was seeing my friends
from home and then when i had time when
i had spare time i played poker
basically so like it was fine then but
when i came first to the uk in 2015 i
was playing full-time and basically the
only thing i had like i was living in a
grinding house as well and basically the
only thing i had was just poker i didn't
have like a balance uh didn't have a big
social circle besides the friends that
were living with me in my house and then
all of a sudden i went on a big
downswing and uh yeah then this thing
happened where i just punched my screen
i was like okay we need to fix something
right we need to change something and
then i discovered uh the mental game of
poker by joe tentler um it was like
really really really good like basically
like a self-help book right you're going
through it and you're taking the notes
you're doing the exercises and you learn
why variance is happening and you you
learn
uh that it's necessity of the game to
have variants and to have downswings and
yeah from that point on i kept on
improving my mental game but obviously
was still a long way i think i read it
like four or five times through my
career um this book but now yeah being a
bit older being a bit more experienced
having a bigger bankroll probably having
less testosterone being
being more reflected about myself and
got overall a bit more quiet i can
really like put these emotions into the
right place and i basically don't get
tilled anymore like i get exhausted and
i make mistakes during it uh during a
session but it's not like i'm sitting
here and i'm steamrolling or something
like that these days these days they are
long gone i make sure these days that i
have a work-life balance like i don't
sit in front of the computer anymore all
day and just like play play play i make
sure i go outside i go for a walk i go
to a gym i meet friends and just like a
day in front of the computer for me
would be like a lost day so i always
have to do something on the side and
have to like really keep the balance and
when i notice i'm getting tired when i
notice i play my b game more often i
just take a break and just take one or
two days off and do something completely
different
yeah i think this sounds very familiar i
think we talked about this in the pub
before when poker is basically all you
have
then
succeeding in that becomes very
important whereas if poker didn't really
go your way but hey you know you have
other hobbies or other things that you
know you're happy with in life
how you doing poker in the short term
doesn't really influence you that much
anymore i do assume you still
what is like the modern tilt version of
julian how does that look
the modern third one i think like i'm
actually like not tilted at all anymore
i said like i'm getting tired and i'm
noticing i'm playing and i feel like i'm
getting sucked down into the earth but
i'm like oh god i'm down so much but the
games are good i keep on playing i know
i should take a break but then when the
games are really good i try to i try to
play a little more but yeah i guess this
is like the thing i have to be working
i'm gonna notice okay this is the time
now it's time to put even let's say even
if you have like a big loser like 100 bb
losers sitting at your table you still
have to be focused because you have to
call down the guy with ace high in
sports right you have to call down the
guy in fifth pair and if you're tilted
or if you're tired if you're exhausted
you can't really make this judgment
anymore so a lot of people are saying
yeah the games have been so good they
had two tables with whale and he was
brewing around money but
yeah it's nice when you get aces it's
nice when you flop a set it's nice when
you plop a flash but when you're third
pair you need to be on a percent focus
right to make the best judgment
so uh yeah this is definitely something
i have to work on in the future and um
yeah i will i will for sure i've always
done and i always will
this is like my form of tilt or like
this is like my my weakness that i'm
having but like getting tilted above
things at the table it's like yeah
another flip another flip loss another
flip plus like kings and aces again it's
whatever like i've seen this like a
million times and it's just it's just
normal at some point i would say yeah
i guess at some point also you learn
along i mean you've been playing for
over 12 years i guess you know
you keep frustrating yourself for all
these things and at some point in your
career like what's the point right like
yeah never mind yeah okay another i mean
obviously still if if there comes a
insane run you know it still
stretches you out a little bit i assume
right
yeah and and it's depending on the
stakes as well right like if i play my
normal mistakes if i play like my i
won't say like comfort stakes but like
mistakes that i'm playing on a daily
basis that are still quite challenging
it's fine but then if you take a shot at
like a higher game you can take a shot
at 5k take a shot at 10k and all of a
sudden you lose you lose three buy-ins
and then you sit there and you're almost
so stressed and then every decision it's
a blackout you blackout you blackout you
play against the best players in the
world and then all of a sudden they put
you into the spot because they will
always put you into the spot and then
it's getting like really really tough
like if it's on my normal stakes it's
fine like i can take a break maybe for
an hour to go for a walk have some food
have a drink like have a coffee or
something then come back and play
good again i wouldn't say like my best
again would play decent again but yeah
if it happens at the highest leg if
you're taking a shot it's getting really
frustrating
what do you think you mentioned blackout
so basically you know your brain just
stop stop stop working what do you think
yeah is it about taking a shot at a
higher stake you mentioned tougher
players that put you in tougher spots
why do you think you black out at those
kind of moments sometimes
at first you play against the best
players and you're like oh [ __ ] this guy
like and like i was always on the
impression that the best guys they have
a bluff in every spot right and then
you're over you're over analyzing and
you see these guys like stefan or
something stuff on one one two two or i
don't know davey jones or linus like you
see the hand histories and you're like
my good god what's going on he bluffed
at this and this spot so
he will be bluffing everywhere so you
you're stressed about this then it's
like a monetary stress of course uh
because you're putting a lot of your
role at stake as well or maybe you have
sold some action and then your weight of
your friends is on your shoulders as
well and uh yeah it's just like
basically it's just the amount of money
and the players that you're playing
against that really make this time so
difficult but then in the end if you
want to climb up the stakes if you want
to succeed at these stakes you have to
go through this but you have to be
sitting in hand and you have to be
choking you have to have a blackout you
have to be realizing this and like learn
from this and then come back and get
more comfortable with that feeling
because like
if you do something for the first time
you will always be nervous you will
always be choking and everything will be
new but to get somewhere where you want
to be you just need to like
keep being uncomfortable keeping up a
little bit then afterwards do the
analysis like go through the hands
analyze them go through with other
players go through with your poker
bodies and then come back and be better
and be more prepared and like feel more
comfortable and if you don't feel
monetary comfortable sell probably more
money or maybe even just like play a
little bit of lower stakes like get a
bigger bankroll and then come back and
play these guys because if you come and
play short i've done this as well like
i've played over my role like a lot a
lot and then all of a sudden you're
losing 50 000 you're losing 100 000 in
quick succession and all of a sudden
hits you like a brick ball and this i
guess this is where like um like tilting
or like a bad mental game comes from in
the long run so
yeah better be prepared when you're
taking a shot have the money ready have
enough money on the side as well because
if you're just like you're trying to
wreck battle on poker stars at like five
can you only have 30k in your role uh
even if you have more money it's feeling
very
uncomfortable like 500k have 150k have
200k on pokerstars and if you lose four
buy-ins it doesn't really matter and you
can comfortably come back and you don't
have to think about the transfers of
where you get the money from and have to
stop bitcoin you have to swap across
pokerstars and stuff like that this is
something
i learned as well like when i do these
wrecked battles like i'm not doing them
at the minute but when i do them i have
to i have the money ready and i don't
want to be stressing about the money
yeah that's uh that's that's definitely
a
good good advice i think also what you
what you said understanding that this is
a certain uncomfort you have to go
through and before you jump into the
session like know that this is going to
happen like
if you take if you put yourself in a
shot like that and you do have a
blackout don't tilt completely like this
was part of the shot right and there's
unfortunately no way around it but i
think uh being a bit
empathetic towards the fact that you're
going to choke in a couple of spots
because of the money pressure because of
the fact that stefan is putting you in a
spot i think that's always very
important to align these expectations
before you take a shot like that
exactly you have to you have to do your
homework you have to be prepared there
your mindset has to be on point again
you have to have the money right you
have to have your skill set ready and
you have to be ready to play spots and
like certain notes or certain lines in
the strategy because these guys they
will play different strategy right they
have different sizings and uh they
probably have leads and spots they have
like two extremes and spots that other
people had 1k or 2k don't have you have
to be like get ready to be freestyling a
bit and like do your best guess and
stuff and then again like if you finish
the session just like really analyze it
like really deeply and see what they are
doing and like try to figure out what
they're doing and what's good about it
what's bad about it and where they have
their little flaws and where they're a
little bit aggressive where they have
like these over frequencies etc etc this
is quite important as well because if
you just come back without improving
you're still the same person your last
session right and last session wasn't
enough to succeed they have succeeded in
the session so it's always just like
study play study play get better come
back get better come back and this is
what i took over from football as well
right you train you train your train and
then you have your one game like on the
weekend and you come back and then you
train and then you analyze and then you
you practice you practice you practice
and then you come back and then that's
how you're getting better
yeah because you you you mentioned that
you realize that when you started to
play poker that the work ethic necessary
to succeed was very similar to the work
ethic necessary to succeed in the games
that you play as you mentioned now
football what do you think are
some characteristics or some
work ethic characteristics i don't know
if this is the right word that you think
are necessary to succeed not only in
poker but i guess in life in general
quite broad but
in life in general i think it's like you
have to continue uh continuously
improving like be insistent with
improving like look back at the person
yesterday right and see what you've done
wrong and just maybe it's not like
getting like like better in like 10
different areas of life or 10 different
areas of poker it's important just to
focus on like one step at a time because
in the end it's like a marathon not a
sprint uh i would say and you just have
to like keep on going and don't don't
compare yourself to someone else right
of course you can have your idols you
can have your cristiano ronaldo poker
you can have your lioness love and poker
but if you want to improve and if you
want to get where you want to be i like
look at the person you have been
yesterday and like look at your mistakes
that you have made and improve them and
then go from there and it's just like in
life as well like if you want to be
happy in life as well right you have to
think like you have to change the way
you're approaching life as well because
if you're doing the same thing for like
a year or two you're getting like
completely bored of your life right and
everything is the same so you actually
you have to go to new places you have to
meet new people you have to read a book
and stuff like that to come back up with
new ideas and yeah to learn some wisdom
from like
uh influential people in the past right
have they been dealing with things as
well so for me it's just like
continuously improving in poker but also
continuously improving my normal life um
so i can really like be a good influence
for my friends for my for my family for
my community right and in the end this
is more important uh than myself because
for myself i've already done everything
right like when you're a poker player i
just it was interesting i had a chat
yesterday with an old poker friend and
we basically said yeah we've already
lived three lives right we played such a
big volume we've been through like so
many ups and downs and we've learned so
much from poker so for me already it's
at a time where like giving back makes
me happy i was more fulfilling to me
than just like keep on doing my own
thing because in the end i've already
done everything i've traveled a lot not
everything but most things right and
then it's very repetitive and in the end
to become like really happy is like
actually like taking care of your
community or taking care of the people
that are close to you and trying to
improve their lives and even just like a
little thing it's just like a phone call
when you call your mom or your dad in
the evening or maybe there's a friend
with something on their mind and you
meet them for a beer or coffee or
whatever it's just like just the little
things to keep on improving and keep on
giving back from your experience so
these people can save some time or like
have like a better time overall i would
say
yeah i think that's uh i definitely can
relate to that that at some point in
your career when you reach a certain
amount of success for example i know you
do coaching as well i transitioned into
coaching as well
at some point you feel like oh i learned
all these things and it feels very
rewarding if you can then share that
knowledge with other people and see them
uh have success i think that's also a
reason for example why we're all here
talking about these kind of things on
the pod right to see if we can say
something that will help the listeners
and share our experience in the past
that we
uh we have walked uh
it's it's it's interesting that you also
mentioned you
a word that i wrote down was same
approach same results that's something
that you mentioned like okay what's
going to be different the next time you
try if you haven't improved the last
time right
sometimes you hear people oh they've
broken up and they come back together
and then i ask okay what are you guys
gonna do different this time
then they don't give an answer it's like
okay yeah this is just doomed to fill in
another six months and yeah six months
later they feel they're good
also i think it's interesting that a lot
of people often
like the uncomfort of taking for example
a shot in a tougher game people usually
try to avoid that uncomfort by preparing
so hard on a previous stake they're
trying to make sure that that doesn't
happen
do you think that that is a big mistake
i think it's a big mistake because at
some point again yes i have the money
ready have the role and be like get
prepared in your head that you can lose
a certain amount but then you can't
prepare yourself for the next big thing
right you can't prepare you can in a
certain way but in the end it's about
like showing up you have to show up and
play these games like like the
anniversary like when you're playing you
get in there you're nervous your heart
will be beating you might be a little
bit excited and they're like all these
like is all these variables that you
really can't prepare for in-game because
you can't really you can't prepare every
spot that will be happening and the spot
will be happening differently to what
you are expecting because the guys are
just better right they will put you they
will put the pressure on and they will
put the pressure on more often than you
than you can ever think of and then
again it's like more sakes more money
and yeah you can't really like simulate
or like think about how the pressure is
so do your preparations do your homework
be prepared but don't over prepare like
one day just if you're feeling ready
just like step up and like i think
there's this famous quote up i think
woody allen or something and he said 90
of life is just like showing up right
just show up yeah do you do your thing
learn from it and then come back but
come back better and don't over prepare
that would be my advice for sure yeah
it's definitely embracing that on
comfort you cannot prepare for a 10k
game at 500 now zoom you know you can
get better technically maybe you know
obviously
but
yeah then when you play 10k against
lions he's going to put you in spots
that the average 500
poo it's not gonna put you in and indeed
like it's uh this is the moment type of
stress you know that that that's filling
your blood um
so you talked a lot about
continuous improvement right this
requires a certain mindset for example
you need to have a growth mindset you
need to believe that you can improve in
anything because else what's the point
right people with a fixed mindset they
see feedback they lose and they accept
well okay then i guess this is my limit
so you need to have the belief that you
can succeed in anything i did in the
questionnaire you did uh you did
actually mention that that you think
talent is a bit overrated and that you
believe you can succeed anything you put
your mind into
when you try to apply this to poker
kind of the loop of continuous
improvement
how did that look on a day-to-day
week-to-week month-to-month basis what
are some things that you were doing to
consistently improve in the beginning of
your career
uh it was like a long time i was just
like playing mistakes and like full ring
and like bomb hunting and there were no
solvers out right you had a few people
that you were talking to and then they
knew some tricks that i knew some things
to do and like people were just like
overfolding in every spot massively but
then it was like i think like six or
seven years ago right the solver era
kicked in and all of a sudden everything
was was changing and in the beginning
like i downloaded pyrosoft of course but
i didn't really use it and i always
asked my old roommates come on let's
start let's start but they were also a
bit like too lazy to do it and then at
some point of just like being like
average you notice everybody's getting
better right and all of a sudden i was
having these like extreme downswings i
remember a time when i had like probably
like 100 buying downstream plus my win
rate was probably like zero point
something ex i was just lazy and i
wasn't putting in work and i was just
like hoping uh that things would go
better right i wasn't in charge i wasn't
in control i wasn't like the creator of
my future i was just sitting there and
just like hoping that the waves will
like calm down in a certain way um but
then yeah after realizing this
um i gave it another shot and i
basically started the coaching with
stefan together he just said yeah you
can join this table as a coach and then
i noticed okay to like give something
back to these guys i need to put in a
lot of work as well and then yeah i
basically started like like a lot of
pile things like get like the the
fundamental understanding of how the
software works and what's the heuristics
behind it and what's like reoccurring
things so you basically you learn the
strategy
uh a little bit and at the beginning i
was like just like trying to copy in a
sense i don't i learned the game like a
vocabulary in the end i was like going
through spots and it was just like
repetitive repetitive oblate another
three report small blenders but i looked
through the sim again i was like okay
this is what the solver does but not
really understanding the whys behind it
just more like trying to copy it so that
was like a starting point for me and
then yeah it turned into like basically
uh me tagging all the hands that i
played whenever i had a question to your
hand before i start the next session i
would go through it with pyle and like
get some yeah come to some new
conclusions or like at least get up the
confidence because in the end it's like
a big confidence game right you need to
be you need to be uh executing and you
need to be executed when it's going
badly as well so you need a lot of
confidence if you're not confident you
can't really pull the trigger when you
need to
and then um what i'm doing now at the
minute is like working with one of our
former students that joined the uh
coaching roster as well he's called
ultegra on focus as you guys probably
know him and
yeah he's not not saying he's my kosher
but we're working very closely together
we're looking a bit past the solution uh
we're looking like what's actually
happening in the spot and how people are
approaching the spot and uh we're not
looking so much at fire anymore we're
just like trying to figure to understand
the game better right to understand the
spot better how is this spot played out
not trying to copy this in but actually
what are human beings doing in the sport
and then uh yeah this is what we are
working on in a minute and then
obviously if it's like uh opponents that
you play over and over again we go into
the database and we're looking for some
flaws
um
and there's strategical approach as well
and um yeah
this is what i'm doing at the minute
like also playing a little bit against
lucid but yeah it's always a bit hard to
get something out it's nice to see what
the bot is doing what's nice to see what
lucid is doing and you see some new
lines that he's taking and then you
could think like can i implement this in
the game does this really make sense and
then we're talking it through and if yes
we're trying to implement it and um yeah
this is the work that i'm doing the
minute
it was interesting you i i heard you say
this a couple like 10 minutes ago or
something and now you mentioned again
the confidence i think you really get
confidence in your ability to approve i
think you said something earlier like
yeah and i will do it again and i won't
prove again just like i did before
uh
how
how has that impacted your career in
terms of swinging in confidence people
can get thrown off
when things aren't going well you
mentioned 100 by in downswing
if you know how to find the solutions
right then if you're confident in your
ability to continuously approve
improve does that help you stay
confident even in moments of downswing
because you're less you get confidence a
bit less from your results but more from
your work ethic
exactly exactly you just need to because
if you stop doing this you all of a
sudden you're living in chaos like
everything is chaos right it's going
badly at the tables you're not improving
and you're coming to the table and
you're already a bit confused you're
already not feeling your best and like
having this like continuous like work
ethic or like study ethic or like trying
to improve and trying to improve that
there's something that gives you like
hope and chaos right or at least you
know when i do this this is something i
can control this is something i'm in
charge of right the other things the
variance that's happening at the table
this is not what i'm in charge of i
don't have to like spend too much energy
with that but i can really focus on my
improvement i can really focus on the
study or like on my another analysis of
the session i've played before and then
go from there and then after years and
years you know it's a cycle right there
it's like after spring there's summer
after summer there's autumn after autumn
there's winter and it's the same with
poker right you have a downswing but it
will only last so long and then you have
to make sure that it's gonna be like a
very short downswing because you keep on
improving and also when you're having an
upswing don't get over
excited or don't get lazy like continue
to work continue to work because you
know the downswing will be coming if
you're playing overconfident all the
time you'll be playing too many hands
and you're taking too many risks and
you'll be like yeah you will be a bit
like yeah you'll make lousy decisions in
a sense as well because you think you
you've understood it all but um so yeah
it's like really important like when
things are going bad to have something
to stick to and like in poker it would
be like studying but also outside of
both like at least have something that
you can measure right go to the gym
three times a week you can have an
influence on that and you see your body
improve like eat healthy to lose weight
have a meaningful religion a
relationship on the side like have
something that is stable that you can
stick to when you're standing in the
storm basically right yeah that's that's
very helpful because it's fine to have
chaos and it's fine to live in chaos and
it's important to manage to live in
chaos and to be fine with it for some
time but if chaos just becomes chaos and
you are the chaos and everything is
chaos like nothing good is gonna happen
from this you need something you can
really stick to and you can really look
forward to even though things are going
badly at the tables because of a
downswing
yeah focus on the things you can control
and get confidence out of that you're
executing all the things that you can
control that you're reviewing your hands
consistently that you're trying to get
better uh yeah very very very good
advice there uh also i think if you're
in a downswing and you're just hoping
for the downswing to end right and then
the downswing ends and you're in an
upswing you automatically oh and i'm not
now it's nice again the necessity kind
of drops you fall in bad patterns uh i
think this is definitely things that
some of the listeners can relate to and
i think throughout your career you know
you you start to see that focusing more
on the things that you have control over
uh it's going to make you a happier
person uh overall
yes
because you only have someone so much
you have so so much energy right your
energy is limited and if you like keep
on focusing on the things you can't
control you spend time and energy with
it you have less energy for the things
that you're actually in charge of right
and then i noticed that me getting older
i needed to cut out a lot of things i
needed to change my mindset in a sense
that i let go of these things or like i
don't worry about these things that i
have control of like um
uh
off the tables as well i spent a lot of
time on social media a few years ago and
then all of a sudden i noticed i spent
like four hours on instagram uh five
years ago and then i calculated this is
like eight and a half days a year eight
and a half days in a year this is like
30 to 40 books you can read or it's like
210 or 220 gym sessions that you can do
and i was asking myself or oh you can
study like poker and these like i ate in
a half days and see how much of a play
you become and i was asking myself what
do you want do you want us browse
through instagram get nothing out of it
besides subconsciously get becoming
unhappy
or do you really want to make that space
create that energy create that time to
put it in something that makes sense to
you and yeah i think in the past in the
past few years i've been really good at
like cutting out things that both served
me and for me it was like a big thing
was like social media and just like
deleted everything and uh yeah all of a
sudden had some space had some energy
because i'm getting older as well right
i'm not 22 anymore i don't have
unlimited energy i can't sit here every
day 16 hours and grind and grind and
grind like my energy is limited as well
and so i have to make sure uh i use it
very purposeful
yeah and you you for for the in order to
realize that instagram is a waste of
time you do need a certain purpose right
you need a certain goal if your goal is
to become the best poker player and
indeed you calculated that eight and a
half dollar eight and a half days of
your years it's wasted on instagram
you're like hmm
is this contributing to my long-term
goal probably not i should probably
spend time on you know some of the
suggestions that you gave
studying doing exercise and stuff like
that uh adam
i hear a lot of
stoic mentalities in julian i think this
is definitely a characteristic of
successful poker players
i agree yeah first of all it's been
really good listening to you guys speak
i think julian's got a lot of wisdom on
developing work ethic on building that
life balance and on not glamorizing the
pocket pursuits it's literally a game of
working hard getting better and the
drive to get better you've talked about
a few times and always been in training
training training training and learning
i think once you've got that built into
your kind of mental blueprint of i'm
getting better i'm improving and you
find a way to uh orchestrate your ideas
around learning improving and getting
better yes it might take you a while to
get to your goals but you're always in
progression you're always moving towards
those outcomes and eventually you'll get
there the only obstacle in the way is
time and your application so yeah this
conversation has been super refreshing
for me to listen from the outside i
think julian's perspectives that he's
learned the hard way in the battle i
always like i always like experience
she'll learn it when someone lends a
kind of a principle for how to live a
life based on hard work and the going
through tough times and julian's a
really good model for that yeah the
stoic principles of controlling the
controllable variables i like something
that said hope in the chaos i love that
i wrote that one down where basically
fucker's picking and there's chips
flying around money flying around you've
got your confidence and mental game that
often goes with that and sometimes it
feels like there's nothing to hold on to
but on the flip side if we could just
move away from the external results
we've got a lot of things that we can
hold on to we've got a lot of
controllable variables and the way you
things begin you've almost mastered how
to show up day after day every single
day you're thinking what i need to
execute on you're eliminating things
that are wasting your time and yeah you
found a way to get more and more of
yourself and it's a work in progress
like some players will be starting
completely in the chaos and their life's
a complete mess and you need to start
building some some foundations around
that other guys are doing pretty well
but they're still wasting a day or two
of the air on twitch or youtube or
something that's not given the value so
as you get higher and higher up the
chain and you have either less energy to
give or you've got you want to get
bigger goals you've got to get more
better better cutting the things that
are taking up your time so i really like
that you're first of all controlling the
control of variables but also stripping
away things that are eaten into your
days and i like the almost like analysis
you did when you were comparing how you
could spend that time to other things i
think that's a really good kind of
blessing because pogba players are
really good at logical thinking and
comparison so if we go um eight and a
half days i could have spent eight and a
half years doing xyz things instead it
gives a good
comparison should i be doing this or
should i know so yeah really good stuff
and yeah really really enjoyed the
conversation so far i did have some
questions on work ethic but to be honest
you guys have done a master class in
that one so far
different angle and i want to go into
your family environment when you started
out in polka so you mentioned that your
mum didn't speak to you for close to
three quarters of a year after you
started poker but your dad was quite
supportive so it's always through that
dynamic when you start a poker were you
playing at home and how did the family
dynamics impact your early career
yeah so i basically like it happened um
we had a day off school the other day
and then
we went to the gas station with our
mopeds and we bought a crate of beer and
then one guy said yeah i have a set of
poker at home
and um yeah so we played poker there and
we somehow got hooked with like nobody
had an idea what's going on but this
turned into like a regular round and we
were playing like uh twice a week for
like five or ten euros like a cash game
or like a quick sit and go and stuff
like that and then i was like
continuously winning in that and then i
gave online poker shot obviously this is
now the short story of it and then back
and forth like deposited hundred bucks
like double it up and then with for the
hundred bucks so i was even then i tried
to gamble it up but eventually i
discovered poker strategy and learned
about uh bankroll management and then i
made my way up so i left my parents
house because i told them i wanted to
study so i moved to a different city
with all my friends from home when like
i went to three lectures and i realized
like i can't be i can't be honest with
that i was so hooked with poker anyways
and um yeah so i started to play poker
and then it was like half a year gone
and then my mom was calling me and she
asked me so are you already practicing
for your exams because it's exam time
soon i said oh yeah no mom by the way
i'm a professional poker player now not
obviously no idea what i was talking
about
and uh yeah i quit the studies and i'm
gonna play poker now full time and then
she basically handed over the phone to
my dad and then it was like radio
silence for like three quarters of a
year my dad was like i said yeah i'm
gonna make supernova uh elite this year
or like or like supernova this year i'm
gonna win 100k i'm gonna travel the
world and he was like oh this sounds
good have fun
and um so yeah at the beginning my
environment wasn't very supportive
like
not speaking to my mom for three
quarters of the year i mean i didn't
care that much at that time but looking
back at it now i can understand it a
little bit as well right because your
parents want the best for you and they
won't want you to be safe but then they
also kind of want you to live the life
that they have lived in a sense and it's
just not happening because you're a
different generation and everything
being online now everything being
digital and so fast i just like i
couldn't live the life that my parents
wanted me to live
i think she has realized that by now she
was here like last weekend and we had a
pretty good time and she's not very
happy with it but i can i can see why
parents are concerned because like
gambling or like poker comes with
something like also some negative
notions i would say like the addiction
behind it or i don't know people sitting
there drinking whiskey playing cards all
night long and like all these like shady
environments and i don't know it's
obviously not a nice fault for for your
parents but um
yeah in the end i always like i've
always done my own thing and i didn't
really care too much and just like kept
on going and then yeah my friends were
like yeah some of them were like fine
with it and some of them were obviously
like not close friends but like distant
people that you know i think they they
took it but inside i think they were
hoping that one day i would be like okay
i'm bust i'm broke i'm doing something
else like we're hoping for me to not
succeed back in the day this gave me a
lot of motivation it just gave me a lot
of energy nowadays i don't care about
these people anymore just like focus on
myself but back in the days this gave me
like a lot of drive as well and i was
like i will prove you wrong and i will
prove you that i'm right and that i will
make it and that definitely happened at
the beginning but now it's obviously
whatever person thinks of me is fine
like it's a it's a free country we are
like it's free speech everybody has an
opinion on something and if you even if
you're doing nothing in life right
people also have an opinion on you so
people will be always a bit judging no
matter what you do and it's fine for me
like at this point for sure
yeah i think it's really good to
acknowledge when you go your own path
you're gonna have some supporters
cheering you on but most of the time
you're gonna have a lot of people
doubting you or maybe not rooting
against you directly but like they don't
mind seeing you fail especially if
you're doing something like poca where
it can be classed as like a completely
different avenue if you succeed in that
it almost makes people feel bad about
their life choices when you're going
down that path you're like fall over go
broke don't make it work why are you in
vegas for why are you doing fun stuff
come back and join us again so uh i
think when you go your own path it's
very
it's very difficult because i think we
spend a lot of time as we're younger
building conformity around us building a
good social structure trying to fit in
do what makes us feel comfortable in our
environment environments then we go wait
a second me and my two friends decided
that we're going to be poker pros and
we're going this way and everyone around
you is like trying to drag you back into
the kind of conventional lines and
you're like i'm going to make it work
but at the same time you're completely
bullshitting because you have no clue if
you're going to make it work all you
know is i like this game i've got half a
chance that let's go for it see i think
these are like hard dynamics and i've
spoken many players on this topic who
can't get past that obstacle their
parents they're going to pull it on
their arms saying don't do this it's too
much for them to take their friends deal
with other things and wanting them to
join in and poke enough fitting into
their social circles some players are
like i can't break free of that thing
briefly in my social circle so i think
it's really good to acknowledge like are
you the person who wants to go there in
one way if you do you've got to
acknowledge it's going to be quite
lonely at first but almost always
especially your scenarios i think a good
example after enough time has passed and
you've proven to yourself and everyone
around you that you've got this covered
you're good at what you do people
generally the main people in your life
will warm to the idea i think oh awesome
good good job i'm glad you were one of
the brave people who did what you wanted
with your life so even though you might
get that validation instantly very often
the good relationships get uh cemented
later on the line but yeah you can't be
in a rush to get that so yeah i like i
like a lot of the things you'll see in
there in terms of going your own path
and not worrying about the haters and
people rooting against you so
quickly on you said some people were
hoping for you to fail were there
specific people in your kind of circle
who were kind of rooting against you or
was that just like a general team in
terms of some people who you don't know
when you see i come from a very small
like i grew up on a village and i i come
from where like uh eventually i moved to
the city but the city was just like 60
000 people right so everybody's living
in like their small circles and then i
was going out uh like like two or three
times per week to the bars and night
clubs and stuff and like people have the
story right and then like in small uh i
think in like small environments or like
small cities that people are talking a
lot behind their back there's a lot of
talk and talk and talk because there's
not so much going on so people what are
they doing they're like talking about
other people's lives so
it was more like distant people like
people that i just like knew that like
from clubbing or like from going to bars
and they heard the story and they like
kind of were in this mindset of like
yeah he's gonna fail eventually poker is
gambling there's some strategy behind it
or he's crazy and look at this guy like
what has he done with his life and yeah
let's give it a few more years and then
he will back here with us and we will be
once laughing but
yeah again like at this point that was
like really this was giving me a lot of
a lot of energy for sure
yeah i like that like you're using that
as a fuel source because i think fuel
source can be both from positive and
kind of negative angles
yeah we can be like inspired to achieve
things or to uh to get us in life
outcomes or we can use the fuel of the
negativity around us people rooting
against us people yeah thinking that
we're gonna fail as energy to fuel us i
think both are good and at certain times
of your life you want to use both as a
fuel source where other people might be
uh almost like take that negative energy
on board a bit all right people are
rooting against me this feels too much
i'm going to fail yeah i like that it's
almost like feeling your fairness of
motivation going forwards so i want to
touch on the career path for you right
so 12 years imagine you're starting your
putt career again from day one you're
almost like go sat nav and you plug in
the sat nav 12 years
yeah let's go let's get started
12 years what were some of the first
obstacles that you hit on that 12-year
journey that made you maybe doubt
that pogba's gonna be a good choice for
you or the right choice for you
i think like the first starting spot
because like even back in the days
people always said we only have one more
year in poker like everybody's gonna
become so good in poker we only have one
more year right and then it was i think
it was april 2011 all of a sudden they
cut off the us from the global uh from
the global poker environment and then
all of a sudden a big pool especially a
big pool of recreational players was
gone and then all of a sudden it was a
bit dry and then you were thinking oh
god like people are getting so good at
this game like how can i compete or like
how how can this ever be fruitful or how
can you make money from it in the future
um but yeah i still like with the
current developments uh especially being
able to play like on acr for example
where you can play on like a global bull
or like the like the lockdowns were also
like really good for poker because
everybody started playing started
playing poker again uh this was very
helpful and obviously like the rise and
like the
um yeah the rise of crypto like being uh
crypto being like a thing that like more
and more people are using so everybody
has more access and can deposit more
money quicker and can withdraw money
bigger like this was like a big factor
of course that that's giving a lot of
like comfort and a lot of hope for the
future and then uh one thing i was
discussing with some friends at some
point was like i always was afraid of
like the young guy that's coming and
trying to take my spot like because you
have it in football right i mean
cristiano those 37 and he's still there
but like it's only a matter of time
until he can't play anymore because
there's this new young guy who's fresher
has more energy and who is just like
biologically just younger
but i think in poker luckily it's not
the case that much anymore because when
you look at 20 year old people or like
20 year old guys uh at this point
they're they're not sitting there and
saying yeah i'm going to become a
professional poker player they want to
become like a twitch streamer they want
to become youtuber they want to become
like an instagrammer they want to become
like an influencer they want to become a
crypto trader like i think they're
they're not too many people like pushing
for my spot right now i'm not too many
people like trying to take take me off
the game so this was also something uh
that was like quite comforting in a
sense and that also like creates like a
lot of tv for the future i think because
i always thought like the time was
limited or i'm getting so old that i
can't do it anymore that
somehow mentally i can't take it anymore
maybe it's like so consuming that at
some point you're just like becoming
worse and i was always afraid of that
but i think since i noticed that when i
continue to improve myself and when i
continue to prove my normal life as well
when i continue to like kind of like eat
healthy kind of go to the gym do some
sports improve improve my mentality i
can also keep on improving in poker and
there's no there's no deadline to it i
mean there will be maybe at 45.50 but
maybe not and maybe at some point i want
to do something different as well maybe
i see a bigger opportunity or something
that's more fun or maybe something
that's more rewarding or maybe something
even working more with with people
instead of playing against people
maybe there's something in the future
like that so but at least i want to keep
the option open to do it as long as i
want it want to do it and as long as i'm
really good at what i'm doing because i
also don't want to become worse than i
am now like because becoming worse um
it's not like a really it's not a nice
feeling right and you know you could do
better and then all of a sudden you're
getting crushed at the tables again and
people are getting better so um yeah as
long as i can stay on top or like at
least on top of the games that i'm
playing uh i want to definitely pursue
it as long as i can as long as i i see a
point in it as long as i enjoy it
it sounds like the fear of maybe poker
not been around for
a long time and maybe people catching up
with you especially in your career was
fueling you in this work i think we've
talked about you put more time in
because you're like wait a second i'm
looking any younger there's a limited
time to make money and i need to make
the most of it and yeah i think you're
coming from a sports background i'm
similar from a sports background it
instills in this mindset that getting to
the top is one thing but staying there
is harder there's always someone hungry
out training in the in the alps
somewhere or training the call he's
ready to get your spot and when you get
at the top and you're comfortable he's
me training waiting to take your your
spot i think it's really apparent in
sports like boxing where you'll often
see someone become the champion and then
the champion leads to an underdog it's
very hard for the champion to stay a
champion like year after year after year
there's like maybe five or six guys in
the history of boxing i've done that
because there's a new hungry guy who
wants your spot more than you want to
keep it so uh it builds this mentality
of like i could offend off the younger
generation so i think it's a good thing
because i think polka is very similar to
sport it's very competitive there is
somebody who wants your spot there is a
kid sitting there in poland or belarus
who's studying his art stuff right now
who wants to be one of the best players
and you could be in your tours to make
sure i'm keeping progressing you've got
a really good start on him and if you
can keep progressing in a similar place
he's going to struggle to catch up but
there is this element of especially the
high stakes games that you do need to
keep keep progressing and keep your spot
in as you've touched on one of the worst
things as a human the feeling of going
backwards regressing
one thing i'm starting to really get
come to terms with i'm 34 now i'll be
going into my my mid 30s 40s that's kind
of the time when you notice physical
drop-offs like in the gym with
performance physically and you've always
got to accept that you can't match some
things you could do in your mid-20s
early 20s recovery takes a bit longer
and you're like damn this is like i'm
regressing in this area we've got to
accept those areas but at the same time
there's so many things that you can be
progressing with you can train smarter
you can do things in a better way you've
got so much life experience which allows
you to not make as many mistakes and
waste as much energy as the younger guys
do since it's kind of like trade-off
balance like you said maybe mid 40s 50s
the young guys overtake everyone and say
all right gg i had a good run but yeah i
think it's good to be thinking of those
terms of how can i steer on top how can
i keep my edge and driving to get better
yeah i really like what you say that's
like it's maybe it's hard to get to the
top but staying on top like this is
what's really what's really difficult
right like staying like at the
world-class level at a master level for
years and years and years of like
getting older and then you always have
to reinvent yourself as well right you
have to keep on doing things smarter
because uh yeah either your mental
capacity or your body you just can't
lift the weights with the same way it's
like you did when you were 25 but you
have to find new ways to train and new
ways to stay in shape for example at the
gym and the same as in poker you have to
like keep on going like go new ways and
be more effective and use your
experience and also of course like like
a bigger role and stuff like that as the
younger guys are more confident just
sitting there like i'm fine with losing
stacks at my at the stake that he's
taking a shot off and he's not really
comfortable so that makes certain things
to it but um yeah the i really like what
you said like getting to the top is one
thing but staying at the top this is
really difficult and then there's a guy
because you mentioned boxing right
there's a guy like tyson fury was at the
top and then all of a sudden got
depressed got drunk addicted but then
coming back from this and becoming a
world champion i think of almost all
promotions now like being the number one
boxer in the world right now this is
something this is the people i like
really look up to and just like where i
pay like my biggest respect and shuffle
head down this is uh respect because i
know how it is and i know how difficult
it is like to drag yourself out of a mud
to track yourself off this like deep
deep hole of like addiction and like
depression in a sense and then come back
to world class this is
next to nothing for sure
yeah tyson fury what a guy he has a
history basically become world champion
conquered the world and then went into a
big state depression taking drugs got
his boxing license stripped from him
gained incredible amounts of weight if
you type in tyson fury overweight
pictures it's incredible to think this
guy's the the world heavyweight champion
but then he went basically off the grid
for a number of years and people doubted
if he's going to kill himself or go off
the rails then comes back with a fresh
motivation first of all to lose the
weight and then to start challenging for
the world titans again and then wins
them all then just beats everyone for
the next few years so yeah amazing story
in terms of i think he's a really good
advocate for mental health but also
overcoming yourself and like you said to
climb the mountain once is impressive to
go so far into the hall back to zero and
then climb it again is almost like
ridiculous amazing story i get a lot of
inspiration from the sports characters
who can divide the odds and do it in a
way that they're if appetizing theories
he's done a really good job of helping
others as well like helping people with
mental health being very open about
depression and the the trials and
tribulations being an athlete and the
pressure you have to deal with so i
think he's in the stage that you're in
as well where yes he's performing at the
highest level but he's looking at ways
how can i give back with what i'm doing
how can i start to be a role model to uh
those coming below me which i think is
like the the ultimate endpoint to be so
yeah really really good stuff all right
i want to go into a section we talked
about earlier when basically so the kind
of model i'm getting a view over overall
is someone who's driven to get better
you're definitely high work ethic and
you're always improving and striving to
get better then there was a point in
your career we talked about when you
were stuck at mid stakes that time we
had the hundred bagging kind of
downswing you mentioned like maybe your
win rate wasn't very good you were
struggling to progress during that phase
like pre-solvers so i want to
dive into that phase of your life and
what was different then what was
happening why do you feel like during
that phase you weren't this driven
person yeah what were some of the
obstacles you were facing during that
period
yeah i think i was like personally on a
level i wasn't in a really good spot uh
i wasn't really reflected um i just like
broke up uh with one of my girlfriends
and then that's getting a good person
though but i guess it's fine so i broke
up with her and i usually whenever i had
something with a girl back in the past i
could there was always a chance for me
to come back and then she was the first
girl that rejected me and i didn't hear
anything from her anymore but like i
really wanted to be together with her at
this point and so like i had this mental
mental trauma that i had to go through
and then i had the poker drama that i
had to go through and all of a sudden
when you're at the bottom when you're
like really scattered to pieces all of a
sudden especially guys they start
reflecting about their situation because
until this point i thought i was the
good i thought i was the good friend i
thought i was like the good part in the
relationship i thought i was a good son
i thought i was a really really good
poker player and i was like really
arrogant overall and very egoistic and
narcissistic in a sense but then all of
a sudden like this like these two things
coming together at some point and
hitting hitting me personally like a
brick ball this like really helped for
me to like reflect and like going
through this like hard like one and a
half years of like hopelessness and
chaos and going to bed crying waking up
crying like looking at the ceiling for
two hours and what am i gonna do i'm
just gonna sit at a table again and get
rude like getting smashed again by the
other guys and then yeah you start
reflect and then all of a sudden i came
to the conclusion yeah maybe julian your
honor the great poker player maybe you
are not the great partner in the
relationship maybe i'm not the great son
maybe you're not the great friend that
you thought you were and then i started
working on that like i was reading a lot
of books
started meditating but it was basically
just like reading and getting more
knowledge about it uh that helped me to
came back and then obviously i realized
i didn't put in the work for poker that
i needed to put in to succeed at these
stakes and um
yeah i went from there and i basically
yeah i maybe had this little tizen fury
moment where i like this tyson fury yeah
yeah experience where i was good or like
i was decent or at least i thought i was
decent and then i came to this like big
big hole but as but i realized i need to
put in some work and i need to keep on
improving to yeah to track myself out of
it or i need to do something completely
different but for me it was like very
important to
to come back and like to prove myself
that i can do it because proving myself
and this this also shows me that
whatever happens in life if i get into
the next sort of next big problems
happening or there's chaos around the
corner i'll find a way i'll find a way
to to drag myself out of the mud and
like overcome it and then basically
succeed or like see life through a
different then somewhere no matter what
it is yeah
it's very interesting how often
something that seems unrelated can have
a very big impact on your performance as
a poker player so you were talking very
holistically there and it sounds like
the breakdown in the relationship was a
real big
like moment where it's like where
everything started crumbling and you
started to have to look deeper and
deeper into yourself to come out the
other side yeah and so for you like when
you had to do that so you almost have
this kind of point where you're breaking
down a little bit where i think you're
questioning who you are you're
questioning your role to the people
around you the relationship that you
make the time into what hasn't worked
out and you start to look into those
kind of insecure parts of yourself what
were some of the things you found what
was the things you saw because i think
this is really important because when
you do this kind of type of work it is
really difficult like when you look at
your kind of feelings as a human and you
have to you you reflect on that you go
into a almost like the operating system
of who you are and you see some things
you don't like it's really hard not to
turn away and go get busy myself doing
something else so yourself you can share
where you went into some insecurities
yourself
yeah i think that the most important
thing i started meditation at this point
and i heard about meditation a lot of
people are recommending it and like like
it was popping over to you or me that's
probably like
like a bigger thing for a longer time um
but i think meditation really helped me
in that sense because you have just like
had like a first start with like five
minutes a day and you sit there and you
have some instructions as well but
already just like sitting there at five
minutes of like being quiet or like
trying to be in a meditative or focused
state is already quite quite hard but
then you get to like a 10 minute session
then you do 15 minutes and 20 minutes
and then it became like for me it became
normal to sit down for 20 minutes and
just not think about anything just like
take a step back from everything and uh
have like this calming coming like
soothing experience i would say and that
kind of helped me as well to basically
take a step back from my normal life or
for like from the things how they were
take a step back and see them from like
a like a bird view for
yeah as an example you just
watch yourself from like a bird view and
then all of a sudden you see these
things that are not working out and all
of a sudden you're like ah okay i'll
take a step back here i take a minute to
breathe and i give the the little chaos
or like the little things that are
running for your head i give them a
little break and all of a sudden you can
see clearly and then when you can see
clearly when your mind is calm you can
see what's going wrong and all of a
sudden i saw okay you didn't put in the
time as a poker player you were also not
this great guy in your relationship
and i figured out okay i needed to work
on this and then i just like was looking
through books on the internet and i
basically yeah i was reading a lot of
books at this time and there was so much
wisdom in it and i took this over in my
normal life and it really really was
like really really helpful but it was
also good it happened at such an early
early stage right because a lot of
people i don't like some will get there
late some probably will get they never
but if you had like this big crisis at a
young age and you learn from it and you
know what's been going wrong and you you
learn your lessons from it and you keep
on improving from it i think uh this is
like really really helpful for the rest
of your life and then in the end we are
only learning from our bad experience
like from top times these are building
the character and these make a person to
the person that he is right now right
because if you never had like any
discomfort if you never had like
any real bad times where you're
struggling and where you didn't know how
tomorrow's going to be how
a year from now is going to look like uh
i think it's quite a i think it's a very
good experience to have had and then
again if you track yourself out of this
or you find ways to get out of this to
improve all of a sudden you there's a
new life waiting for you at least that
was my my experience for sure
thank you for sharing that and going so
deep with that it'll be very helpful for
the audience and yeah i think meditation
is a great tool that almost everyone
should have some form of meditative
practice if you don't meditate per se
you should have some form of practice
that allows you uh exactly what julian
says to be the observer the observer of
your thoughts and the process of the
mind which is often very active also
observing emotions and when you do get
good at that game it doesn't take
awfully long but it's just a consistent
practice like we talk about consistency
training over and over you get the point
where you realize there's a lot of chaos
going on and there's lots of ways you're
showing up in life which aren't in
alignment with where you want to go and
when you can just be the observer
watching yourself get caught up in all
the dramas and all the things that are
going on you can start wait a second
well i've got control i can actually
choose my actions so i think it's a
really important progression as a human
to go through to realize we don't need
to be robotic caught in the chaos we can
spend time still in the mind becoming
the observer of the mind and watching
the thoughts and emotions come up and
when we do that we build this kind of
awareness of what's actually going on
and that gives us the opportunity to
make changes so for you you saw that you
weren't spending enough time on polka
you were probably wasting energy on
things that weren't important to you and
all of a sudden these are like very
fixable things like i'm not sure enough
and very often we're not thinking that
way we're blaming people we're blaming
situations we're saying oh well i can't
do this because of this excuse in
reality we're not still enough to
observe and go actually i can do a lot
better than this and i can show in a
better way so yeah really really big and
that's like i think the evolution of it
humans should be going down this path
and they said different different phases
different people some people watching
this listen to this will be resonating
deeply going yes i'm exploring this
myself but this will be going get away
from me i want to go back into pocket
strategy stop talking about such deep
concepts but yeah i think it's really
good and you talk about building
character through the tough times which
i think is really important and i think
a really amazing skill which takes a
long time to develop is the
perspective to realize as you're going
through tough times that you're going to
come out the other side stronger i think
some people who develop respective
skills are good at reflecting back they
look back in time ago ah yeah that six
months was really good cause i learned
this skill but in the midst of a real
challenging scenario whether it's a
divorce a downswing some something
really bad in your personal life to
realize ah even though this hurts right
now this is built my character i'm
growing for this i'm going to come up
with a side of it i don't know when i
don't know how it's going to unfold but
i will be a better version maybe once
this ends at some point so i think
building that into your
uh your character trace is a really big
one
yeah and it's also important as you just
mentioned that you see that you are
always part of the problem right like
every problem that's occurring to you
it's not an external source it might be
an external source but you always have a
little bit of influence right it's kind
of a loser mindset to say oh yeah i
can't do this because of this and that i
don't know
what's a good example for it uh
i don't have a good example now but if
you see yourself as part of the problem
you can actually take action you're in
charge as when you're always saying oh i
can't do this because of this external
source all the politicians there they're
charging so many taxes like i can't live
my best life like half of my salary has
gone through taxes and you have this
kind of like lose our mindset but when
you realize you're in like you're at
least 50 or like when your relationship
right whenever there's a problem with
curing you at least 50
of this problem and then you have to
realize that it's not the other person's
fault always right and that it might be
just even more of your fault and then
when you realize that then you can
yeah you have something to grab onto
your something something to to work
towards
yeah it's like taking ownership of the
situation i think sometimes we've got to
accept that
there is lots of factors in player but
it's the most empowering to say i'm to
blame i'm in control of this as soon as
you start blaming external other people
you relinquish the opportunity to be
able to fix it imagine like everything's
going bad in your life is because of
somebody else you best befriend that
person very quickly because they hold
the keys to your life on the flip side
like everything's going badly and it's
my fault that's things a lot faster
you've got to like acknowledge that and
come to potential but now say well it's
me who's messing up i can fix it all
right at least i'm in control here let's
get started let's get a plan going so i
think it's a definitely a point where i
speak with players all the time like i
can see players looking for that escape
blaming someone but me blaming
situations but me and there's other
players who were like yep i need to do
better i'm not sure enough i own it and
those players who own their kind of
shortcomings are always the ones who
make the fastest progress because they
they've acknowledged that there's things
that they can improve they focus on
those variables and yeah long behold
things often get better

but without further ado let's get back
to more goodness in this episode
as already yourself reflecting have you
been in through any moments yourself
where you've had to almost put a pause
on poker or look deeply and reflect on
on your own maybe shortcomings
throughout your career
um many times
for sure uh for sure many times
even though i guess it helped that or in
one way it helped that i was always
leaning towards being underconfident
uh which i think
helps because you automatically sort of
assume that it's your shortcomings which
you know it's a whole nother problem in
itself
but in this case that would really help
like i would just always assume that i
wasn't good enough or that it was uh
certain things for example uh you could
say trauma that i developed since little
no one really expected a lot of me and i
noticed throughout my career that that
has really holded me back because i
wasn't really prepared to have a certain
amount of success and then when i
suddenly did have a certain amount of
success i there was like almost a
disconnection in my brain like wait you
were not
made
to be as successful as you are now so it
was really hard for me to believe that
reality at some point and that i was
almost trying to get away from that
reality because i figured it's just a
matter of time before the real reality
which is gonna say that i'm not good
enough is gonna turn around the corner
so i've had my fair share of experiences
and i think poker especially because how
fast you can make progress in your
career right some other people they get
to a job it takes five years to to reach
a certain promotion then another five
years but in poker you can have
all that experience within a couple of
years and i think
with the obstacles like julian also said
if you then
overcome those and use those as ways to
improve yourself and develop yourself i
think poker can be such a rewarding
profession in terms of growing as a
person i think it's also something that
julian said sooner or later you will get
confronted with
your shortcomings your limiting beliefs
your quote traumas and i think the way
poker is
it
gets you confronted with it quite fast
right and
that is an opportunity in my opinion
because better like junior said better
now than later right
i wanted to touch on
a couple of points that you mentioned
that it's very hard for some people
to
accept indeed you were mentioning you
thought you were maybe way better than
you actually were and usually the ego
likes to get in the way of that
reflective moment right but when the
pain is that great and there's there's
no one else to blame but you it's like
okay i guess i'm the problem but it's
really hard
to
to admit yourself but i do think it's
necessary in order to make progress that
you're like okay i've been doing these
things wrong and that's okay
right and i think many players will
struggle to accept that for example in
the past they did something wrong and we
usually prefer to hold on to that
instead of changing because if we would
change then we're kind of have to admit
to ourselves that we did it wrong in the
past and that we wasted multiple
uh multiple years doing something wrong
or believing something that was actually
not true
so it's very important it's okay you
you're not perfect you didn't do it in
an optimal way and that's okay i believe
that you always try to do your best with
the information you have at that moment
right you're not on purposely making bad
decisions it's just that you know maybe
you didn't have the knowledge that you
have now to make a better decision at
that moment and therefore you made a
wrong decision but you don't do it on
purpose so again i think and we touched
on
the point of empathy throughout other
podcasts as well being empathetic
towards yourself i think is very
important in order to be able to grow as
a poker player
anything you would like to add to that
julian
why it's worse why so you summarize that
uh quite well i have to say
i mean yeah like i said it's the
opportunity that uh being a poker player
can offer you if if if you try to take
your job series and try to constantly
improve
uh
and for example we're also for example
when i play we're talking about being
the observer i always try to remind
myself before playing i always have a
nose file open then i try to observe
myself if that certain feelings come up
or if i'm overreacting or if i'm choking
right we talked about the blackouts
i know i write that down and what that
does it already creates some distance
between actually you experiencing the
motion and me observing
uh it's almost like i'm renee and the
wacko is going to play and renee is
going to observe the wacko playing right
that makes dealing with bad bad runs at
the table way more easy like oh wow the
wacko really flipped out of this at this
moment interesting why why is he getting
triggered like that and it really helps
you distance so you can continue your
session in a more rational way right
you're it's i think in meditation they
often give the example it's the
difference between you standing under
the cold waterfall or you looking at
someone standing underneath the cold
waterfall yeah it's a completely
different experience
yeah it's also good to take these kind
of notes right in general like even if
it's in poco or just send diaphragm
because we have so many thoughts on the
day i don't know you have like 10 or 20
000 thoughts on a day and they're all
like coming in they're coming out but
like putting the things that are really
like all grinding on your gears that are
grinding on your mind putting them down
on paper and then like really reflecting
about them it's like it's like a very
important thing to do because if you
don't write them down it's just another
thought that comes in and it goes out
and you're like oh yeah that's important
i should be thinking about it but then
are these like other 20 000 thoughts on
a day that come in and you forget about
it so like actually like journaling and
like writing down what's on your mind
and then take some time to like work on
that or to reflect on it this is like
really really helpful in general as well
i would say
yeah i always say that every session is
an opportunity to get to know yourself
better so you're gathering information
about how you respond to certain
situations you're getting information
about hey this is a spot that i'm not
really uh really aware of because you
know i don't really know what to do
constant information
that you can use to get better in the
future right and then for example
especially when it comes down to mental
game you take
uh you start to see certain patterns
like hey i keep feeding in a certain way
in a certain scenario or keep reacting
to a certain spot
in a certain way and what you do then
you grab that information you sit down
you grab a piece of paper you say okay i
feel anxiety around performing at you
know taking a shot at a higher stake
okay start from there we have anxiety
this is what i'm feeding what comes up
and just start writing down and at some
point you start to make like hey
you start to make links between
uh between certain things that you're
feeling and certain things that you've
experienced before and this is
information that you need in order to
improve right julian already touched on
that it's very important to constantly
be improving and for that we need
information and i feel like a lot of
players they miss on that information
every session you play has so much
information to offer you
uh that you can improve on
yeah for sure that's um
it's it's important to really like uh
face your problems as well like to face
the things on your mind because like a
lot of people i think that they're going
into the book of mindset oh yeah there's
this problem maybe i just like push it
to the side and i push it away and then
maybe it's it's not going to come up
again but whenever there's something on
your mind when you're not facing it and
you're really working on it
and you're not trying to get it straight
the problem under like the monster
underneath the rock is just like growing
and growing and if you let it there stay
there and grow it comes back even bigger
and then that's one problem right and
then if you have because we always have
many things on our minds like many
little problems and if you have many
little problems like growing over weeks
and weeks and you never face them all of
a sudden you will be just like in an
ocean of problems and your whole life
and everything is just a problem right
and uh so it's like really important to
like face these kind of things like in
poker as well like um
yeah like
practice like go into whatever like look
at the session that you have played and
like see your flaws and see what you're
doing wrong and like really face and not
be like ah no that was just variance or
that was just the guy just got lucky or
something like
see for what it is and then uh like try
to fix it and again if there's something
on your mind as well like try to fix the
problems that you have with your friends
or try to fix the problems that you have
in your mind as well because that also
will translate into poker right if you
get it go into a session you have
problems with your best friend or you
have a problem with your girlfriend or
whatever there is with your family if if
you're going into a session with like
all these other problems yeah you will
not perform your best right you will not
have a good session you will just like
take over the problems from your normal
life into your poker life as well and
then vice versa as well then you're
getting crushed at the tables and all of
a sudden you let these emotions out to
your girlfriend that you're already
having
other problems with right and all of a
sudden the chaos is waiting so that's
what i always say to everyone and i see
this a lot with friends i said face your
problems right i've been there i've not
done it i've avoided problems and i've
been into this like deep deep dark hole
and it's like really hard to get out of
this but if you just continuously work
on your problems and if you face them or
if there's something on your mind with
your partner or girlfriend it's like say
it out immediately because most of the
time the problem is also just in our
head but when you speak about it with
your friend you speak about with your
girlfriend or wife and then all of a
sudden she's like yeah but that isn't a
problem like we can just do it like that
and then it's fixed right but you
overthink it and it keeps on growing and
everything is chaos chaos chaos again so
that's definitely a definitely a good
point or definitely something to take
away from here
yeah i definitely have that bad habit as
well that i like to
think for example i have to say
something to a person but before i
actually said it i already had a
complete dialogue in my head like oh
yeah but i'm gonna do this and then he's
gonna say didn't then this and then
basically because of the dialogue you
had in your head
you didn't even want to have the
conversation that's only building up
more anxiety you're putting it off
whereas in truth usually if you just
have the conversation it doesn't we
cannot mind treat the other person right
he can respond in a way that you didn't
foresee
i think in relationships this is this is
exactly the same
and yeah everybody has a different
perception of life right everybody's
perceiving things differently sometimes
you think that everybody is like on the
same level but people are on like so
many different levels and uh it's
important to to realize that that as
well because i always thought
everybody's thinking like i am but like
the best example is it's it's 25 degrees
outside the sun is shining and i go out
and say that's a beautiful day that's my
favorite temperature i really like it
and there's another person says oh it's
way too hot here i like it when it's 18
degrees and a bit cloudy or something
like that so who's right or who's wrong
and everybody's perceiving everything
different and uh accepting this and
accepting that people have different
perceptions than your own perceptions
this is also like quite a helpful thing
and then you're more understandable and
you respect other people's opinions as
well as when you think oh no this
person's not thinking the same way as i
am oh i must be wrong this person must
be wrong or this is wrong this is wrong
it's just we're all living a different
life and we're all like went through
different things that made us to the
person that we are
today right so
it's important to be open to that
wise words i wanted to go back to
uh
you living in the uk in a grind house i
think you mentioned you were living with
other players um
what do you think is the value of living
together with other poker players we you
covered a little bit of the downside
right your your sort of life work
balance kind of went out of the door
yeah so there was too much poker but i
assumed there were also a lot of upsides
yeah so so nowadays i'm like now living
by myself for a year and then for the
last four years i was only living with
stefan dccnastic it was just the two of
us uh but he was also like half of the
year gone he was in amsterdam and then
before that we had like this big grind
house so when i came here from like 2015
to 2017 we had this big grind house we
first were three poker players and then
we were five poker players
um one of the benefits is just like
you're living poker right and at this
point like i didn't really care too much
about the social life i didn't read
maybe looking back i should have had
more balance but you're just living
poker right you it's like every day just
like poker like a lot of the topics like
even like when when the tables are
closed it's just like you're discussing
strategy and you're always somebody like
a good player to talk to and you get
different opinions from different
players as well we're all like playing
like different stakes but there was
always somebody like giving in a good
input and you could ask multiple people
and then you can create your best
opinion out of these people's opinions
and then you then you can go actually
make very good decisions for yourself so
like definitely the benefit was like
like i was playing like mistakes at this
point but i was living with d7 donald
and he was like playing 5k heads up and
stuff he was playing 10k he was playing
really big games and i could take away a
lot from him and then all the other guys
there was even if they were also just
playing mistakes everybody always knew
something that you didn't know
and it was just like a big learning
experience it was very extreme and it
was very little time for other things
there was no time for like
uh for like a intimate relationship or
like for girlfriend or something like
this wouldn't be possible like i tried
but it's impossible when you're in this
environment but then on the other side
if you want to be successful in it you
have to make some sacrifice as well and
you have to go a bit extreme i would say
uh it's at a certain point your career
is probably like at the beginning of the
career when you have to go a little bit
extreme and leave other things on the
side to get where you want to be and
yeah that was definitely like the best
thing just like living with other
players like discussing strategy
non-stop and also seeing somebody play
you're like okay let's play as well
right because if everybody's lazy if
everybody's just sitting on the couch
watching tv you will be sitting on the
couch as well but we played so we also
played different schedules and then they
were playing through the night i came in
the morning you were still playing and
next thing you do just sit down you play
as well so that was quite helpful and we
established like really good
relationships and we're still all like
very tight friends and like good friends
and uh yeah we're seeing each other a
few times a year and still in touch for
sure and nowadays there's obviously i'm
really by myself now since almost a year
and yeah just the communication goes
through skype discord right i'm speaking
to uh to my team or like to add to both
alex's um that are the coaches as well
and uh we're doing everything basically
online so poker is also like the other
business right everybody went from going
to the office to to having your little
meetings and strategic uh settings you
just doing everything online
everything's just like through skype and
like um yeah
it but still it's uh i've i've noticed
as well like
there there's just this thing if you
live together with poke player or if you
share an office with poker players
it's you know you pass by it's like hey
hey i have a couple of hands can you can
you quickly give some feedback on it
it's way more spontaneous whereas if you
have to plan everything innocent it's
it's definitely
it's definitely less effective it can be
it can be still effective but you won't
get that same view as if you live
together with poker players you know
you're just
let's grab a launch and then suddenly
you know a big idea pops up i'm sure you
had
a couple of big aha moments you also
mentioned d7 was definitely playing way
higher than you when i was uh living in
my first poker house uh there was f my
life who was playing 5k 10k and i was
playing 210l so obviously you were like
okay wow this is this is this is a whole
nother level uh yeah what were some of
the aha moments that maybe d7 or
especially in the beginning when you
joined the the grand house that that
stuck by you
and there i think there were so many
harmonies because i was just i was just
average right i was selecting my tables
well i was bomb hunting quite hard and i
wasn't really good at uh i wasn't really
good at the day at the game especially
the pre-solver era and just seeing them
play seeing how they approach sessions
seeing how they study or for me seeing
that they study at all right because i
wasn't really studying back in the days
like that was quite helpful and then uh
donald like i remember he was like very
he was very organized as well he was
like a very organized human being and he
also like you mentioned he had a
notebook next to his table and he was
writing things down during the session
he was writing down what he ever he has
experienced in the session and then he
was reflecting on it and then he was
working on it and then obviously he got
our powers by herself when he was going
through the spots um that he has played
in the session and they're like seeing
this and like see how this guy is doing
things that really really really helped
myself or then
he was just like like watching me for a
session and then we were talking about
the things that i'm doing and things
that i'm doing wrong that i'm not
aggressive in some spots uh he's like
yeah you can push my equity here you can
be more aggressive here and this guy's
doing that and that was quite quite
eye-opening for me as well just like
seeing how the better players or the
guys they're playing higher stakes what
their habits are and how they're
operating uh this is like quite helpful
especially when you're playing lower
stakes if you have somebody to look up
to then you can take over their real
life habits as well like what are they
eating what kind of books are they
reading are they doing sports and then
most of the time the credit the answer
is always yes right they will be eating
uh quite healthy they will be doing
sports quite regularly like they will
have like a certain schedule they won't
be like playing all night and then it's
like sleeping until like 2 p.m like
there there's there's a there's quite a
bit of structure in these like
successful people's lives i would say
okay and then in in this you also have
to be sort of let's call it lucky to be
in the right environment right where you
have people who indeed took it so
professional because i remember
uh me
me and brian scarface vot we were
looking at at my life and you know the
kid was uh 17 even back then when he was
playing 5k uh
and
we were with some things we were like
well
he's not doing that so we don't have to
do that either he was definitely he was
definitely raw talent you know there was
less of uh i wouldn't call him very
organized uh planned it was just
randomly okay we all sit down to play
now okay let's go play you know there
wasn't really a lot of organization so
actually we often used it as an excuse
like oh the better player doesn't do
that so we don't have to do it either
which i actually had to go then through
some experience where i was like wait
but i am not like f my life right i am
different
so i have to find
what works for me
did you experience anything similar to
that that you were trying to copy maybe
certain habits of people around you in
the house that you were like but i just
don't really work like that that doesn't
work for me
yeah i mean i saw like i saw him doing
these things and i still like didn't
take them over and like i still got away
with it but my win weight wasn't great
and then i was still reflecting him i
was obviously obviously i'm not a donald
like he's way smarter than me he's way
more crowned than me he comes from a
different background so i realized i'm
not donald but if i want to get to the
level that he's playing i probably have
to take over like certain habits of him
but at the same moment realizing you're
not donald and you you're not gonna
become one-on-one like kim right you you
can't be a copycat and just like fake it
till you make it yes i took over his
good habits but
uh like it sounds like i was i was
myself as well right you have to realize
that you are a certain way that you
can't change it but you can like take
over like little things from from all
the other people's that you're looking
up to and then create your own best self
right it's also that what's the point in
like trying to be someone else like
trying to be like the idol that you're
having yes you can take over the habits
or yes you can take over their work
ethic or their skills or you can take
their advice but you have to come to
your own conclusion and you have to make
things in a way that you are comfortable
with that that you enjoy the way you're
living or the way you're like i'm not
playing poker
uh
yeah that's what i would say
you mentioned that at that point your
win rate wasn't really uh that great
what changed that
do you still remember when
your win rate started to go up and what
was the sort of flipping point for you
the flipping point was definitely i was
also like as i was smoking weed a lot
at this point and uh yeah i realized i
need to i need to stop smoking weed as
well because you sit there and you're
playing a little bit baked a little bit
too lazy for like studying so the first
big thing was to yeah to quit wheat uh
to quit beat for good and this like
definitely definitely helped me a lot
and then just realizing that like i used
pio like once or twice a week and i was
still not very good at the game i didn't
understand how the server works and how
everything works and then just like
realizing that the other guys that are
playing the games that i want to play
they are probably grinding pio every day
right they're probably they're doing
their preparations and they're taking
them one or two hours a day to get
better and i was just sitting there and
i thought i could just like grind it out
or like the downswing will be over so i
wasn't really thinking of a solution i
just like tried to keep on doing what i
was doing before and that didn't really
serve me so i had to come up uh yeah
with like new solutions and then in the
end it's it's like doing the things that
you don't like to get where you want to
be right because still to that day it's
not like i'm really excited to to look
at my hands or not to prepare my session
or
to to study a lot because i like playing
more and i like being yeah in the games
and just like play and be competitive
but to be competitive you just need to
practice right
you started pre pre-solver age just like
me
uh i'm sure when solvers first came out
you were probably also a little bit
skeptical you were you also named
yourself way more as an exploitative
player
what were some
mistakes you made when starting to
use solvers in the beginning
yeah looking back obviously just like
copying the solution all they say you
play the session and then you're still
like in the session and you haven't wind
down and just open up files over you
fire up the sim and then you just look
for
for the hand that you've played right
you've been a sport you had ace queen of
spades and then it gets the river and
you call it all in and you just look in
the server okay ace queen of spades yeah
they call you okay i did well that was
like one of the biggest problems just
like not
understanding uh understanding the
solutions or like not like really
looking from both sides like what are my
value that's where are the bluffs coming
from from this opponent to make this a
screen or space call on a river
profitable call and then if you don't
really analyzing the the simulation and
just like clicking through quickly
um yeah you will just like you will not
learn anything you have like this this
short term satisfaction of like okay
i've played this hand well but you don't
know why you've played it well maybe you
haven't played it well because your
opponent doesn't find all the plus that
that pyro will be finding right like
this is something definitely to analyze
the simulation not that just like
clicking through quickly and and just
get to get to the river and see if you
call or your bluff was a good a color
bluff like see both sides and then see
where bluffs are coming from and then
think about if population or if your
opponent because you know your opponent
if he's a bit more aggressive he will
have more bluffs if he's a bit more
passive he will have less plus and then
think about population will population
find all these kind of bluffs that pio
is doing here to make this like a 2bb
winner on the river right this is
something very important to not just
copy the simulation but also understand
where why why it's in a certain way and
why is this called profitable why is
this profitable and like spend some time
and it's probably good to
take on either like another like uh your
studying partner or your coach or
something and go through it together
because i always feel like when you go
through simulations especially together
you'll come to better so solutions and
you will actually like dig a bit deeper
and then you will hear somebody else's
opinion maybe you have a misconception
as well
while studying and then uh yeah you have
a misconception you take this over to
your strategy and you do this mistake
over and over again at the table and
then it's going wrong so like
like having a studying partner or
somebody you can like on a day-to-day
basis really study with i think that
that's quite helpful as well because
doing everything by yourself i know
linus did it for the most part of his
career he just like made it by himself
but i think for a lot of people it's
quite helpful to have somebody who's
like on the same path right who's like
their every day but it also like keeps
up the motivation the accountability
right and then you just like do it
together and then when you have a
downswing you have a downswing together
when you have an upstring you have an
upstring together right you're sharing
your experience and you're sharing your
moments as well and just like keeps you
going it doesn't necessarily needs to be
a guy that's playing the same level like
you can also like let's say if i play 2k
i can study with a guy who's playing 500
zoom and he will have like he will know
things better than i know you always
have to expect that the guy that's
sitting
in front of you like knows something
knows more than you do it's not really
depending on the stakes always right
yeah we all have our strong
sides and our weak sides and this goes
for everyone probably you know if you're
the higher stakes player you have a
higher win rate on effort you will give
a bit more information to him but
without giving that information to him
you will not have received the
information that he will give to you
right so that's usually how you have to
see it i think in a
study relationship when it comes down to
poker
yeah
any
big
aha moments from the solver yeah you you
you learned how to not use it do you
still remember a moment where i was like
wow
oh my god
yeah this is amazing
this will be definitely one advice that
i would give to everybody it's like to
keep keep the strategy simple right not
give yourself like three sizings on
every street and don't try to mimic the
solver in a sense that you think you can
play these three different notes
perfectly balanced right because if
you're doing this you probably are
you're just like exploiting yourself and
you're looking down at your hand and
then if you give yourself like three
sizings you will probably always give
like make like put the sizing in play
that your hand will would want to do so
uh yeah for people who are new to pyro
on youtube studying probably like keep
the strategy simple on flops and turns
and then on the river start splitting
sizings and um yeah don't put in like
three different sizes and five different
race eyes and then click through and say
yeah you see pyro is raising this ex
extremely big size for like two percent
of the time i raced it here in this spot
so i didn't make a mistake so like keep
it simple and then because the game is
so complex and there are so many
different situations right and then you
have single race sports from all the
positions and you have three bedpods you
have four bypass and you play heads up
and then when you give too many
variables into the solver you're just
getting confused because we're not a
computer and you're also not playing
against a computer so keep the strategy
relatively simple and understand your
strategy and then if you get at a very
good level then maybe implement a few
more sizings on certain streets but it's
very complicated i think even at the
highest level even at least like 10 20k
wreck battles um they start to
multi-size now but even then on a bad
day i think even the best are giving
away a lot of things in certain spots so
for like everybody who's playing with
stakes or i don't know 500 1k2k like
keep it simple and don't try to imitate
the solver and like really understand
your simple strategy and just like play
it and then when you get to an even
better level then you can make
variations and then you can get become a
little bit funky and you start leading
and you start implementing smaller and
bigger sizes and you freestyle a little
bit more but first like stick to
something you can control that's
relatively simple but i mean it's
already not relative it's relatively
complex already but keep it simple that
would be my advice like don't put in 10
000 sizing just
keep it easy
until you're at the point where you can
actually where you understand what's
going on where you understand the solver
where you understand your opponent where
you understand the spot how the spot is
played out and then you can make it
complex again but first
make it easy it's not like the best
players like there or like the people
that are on their way to the top that
they did something crazy they kept their
strategy simple and they were sticking
to it and then at some point when they
were at this master level then it's when
they started to to make it more complex
but yeah like when you're building a
house right you don't start to build the
roof you first need to you need to start
building the fundament of it and then at
the end you're building the roof and
then you can get a little bit crazy and
funky and take these sticky lines and
stuff
yeah i don't think we should
make things more complex than necessary
and definitely if for example you want
to use a three sizing split
just because pio says to use a three
sizing split but you don't understand it
i think that's where it goes wrong i'm
actually personally a big fan of
looking at sims with multiple sizings
because you can suddenly see that hey
i think it's it's a common misconception
that for example when a solver only five
percent
uh wants to bet big for example on a
certain flop a certain turn
i think it's a bit misconception to just
i'll be like oh it's five percent so
it's not there because sometimes there's
a couple of hands that specifically want
to bet that sizing and in there in my
opinion it's actually a great
opportunity to learn like hey
interesting so overall this is not
really a thing but what are the
characteristics of this spot with this
hand that leads it to one to bet big and
in there i think is a great opportunity
to learn and if you learn that concept
then
you can
uh if you're playing you know that spot
you don't have to find a big size but if
intuitively you're like hey this is that
hand that it makes a lot of sense with
let's throw it out but the problem is
when you start to expect yourself to
execute the three sizing spit perfectly
it shouldn't be that shouldn't be the
expectation but if in game it comes up i
don't think we should limit ourselves to
a simplified strategy
do you agree with that
it's it's depending it's depending also
like first if you're confusing yourself
a bit uh then it's probably not a good
thing and then second you also have to
think about if your opponents are
noticing it all of a sudden because if
you play against the best they will
notice like certain things like certain
notion then all of a sudden he went he
did this five percent note but then he
only had the nuts right uh i guess if
you're playing against good opponents
you also need to be balancing it if
you're playing like big pools if you
play like mistakes i think then you can
be a bit more exploitable and just like
use this big sizing and not be balanced
with it at all and just like use it with
you with your good hands for example but
then at a certain level like people will
notice when you're unbalanced in these
kind of spots
of course you can make it complex but i
think for the beginning of uh for like
learning i think keeping it simple is
good and then
later on make it a bit more complex but
i said if you play against the best you
better have to be balanced in that note
as well because they will notice and
they will be very observant observative
if you're playing like a if you're
playing 100 zoom on stars and they're
like 300 or 200 players in there like
who cares like nobody will notice
they're all playing four tables of zoom
nobody will like change like see a
change in your sizing patterns for
example and then it will be such a big
influx of fish or recreational players
that it doesn't really matter in the end
like it's one thing playing good against
uh professionals but then there's the
other thing also like playing good
against fish like this is also another
another level or not like another
strategic level that you have to be good
at because i also saw a lot of students
and a lot of people they they're like
they play their hand against the fish
and they're putting it into pioneer
they're
against recreationism as well and to me
it didn't make too much sense and i
think it's a big big misconception
yeah then you don't really understand
why you solve our rng's if you start rng
against the recreational or you're just
like i don't want to make a decision
let's give it to the rng rng yeah
i hear this many many times these days
people are always blaming the rng and
like you stack somebody that you know
then you get a message on skype and he's
like oh you can you're so lucky my rng
was won and i was like so you're giving
away your best judgement to like
something you have no control of me it's
good to do it but you also have like you
have to have a good strategy with your
rng right if you're just using your rng
to like um
to to try to not have like a difficult
decision and just like put it into the
numbers then i don't think it's a good
thing but if you're having like a proper
rng strategy and you're playing against
an opponent but you have to actually rng
then it's good but for me personally i
i don't use 9g always say i am the rng
and
i just make my decision intuitively
so i think there's uh especially you
it's it's because it's interesting
because the advice that you gave
simplified and in the questionnaire we
usually give people uh some some
some options and you could choose
between i prefer simplified strategies
or i use a complex arsenal of lines and
sizings whatever comes up to me at the
moment i'll do
and you actually went for that side but
you were talking mainly as advice
right right you should start sing play
and you can do this because you
understand how a solver generates ev in
certain lines so intuitively it makes
way more sense to you to sometimes take
an alternative line than the simplified
strategy correct yeah yeah for sure
exactly like that advice for like
keeping it simple that was just for
everybody listening who like is trying
to climb up the stakes who has maybe not
this like deep understanding of the soul
but who hasn't that deep understanding
of the spots at the beginning again keep
it simple like at my level maybe then
you have to go past the solution and
then you have to go different ways and
then you have to do some exploitative
stuff as well against certain opponents
but this is my level as well like i'm
not playing like the top 20 level of 15
level where where it's actually the best
in the world just competing without fish
like i'm not at this level as well so i
know i can do some explorative stuff and
i can have lines where i'll always only
have nuts and i cannot we'll have lines
where i'll be only bluffing for example
or like well my strategy would be not
balanced for sure but i'm aware of that
it's always important to be aware of
these things right if you're doing
something out of the line be aware of it
because
if you're not aware of it then all of a
sudden it becomes your habit as well
like all of a sudden you're taking this
line you're not aware that you're
exploiting and then in the end you're
just exploiting yourself so it's
important to always be transparent and
to see what you're doing and know okay
this is not an exploit i'm doing this
because of this in this reason and then
it's fine but if you're just like doing
it automatically you're playing your abc
you're playing on autopilot uh then all
of a sudden like you do this exploits
like left and right and all of a sudden
your whole game becomes an expert and in
the end you're not exploiting everyone
but yourself right
yeah and i think it's also interesting
as you know i would label myself more of
a fellow exploitative player uh
you are sort of you end up being
balanced because the pool is made up of
different profiles so instead of rnging
a hand
you would sometimes always bet or
sometimes always check a hand versus a
specific profile so in the end your own
stats will appear to be
quote quote balance however you're very
unbalanced against a certain individual
but you do that because his leaks allow
you to take a very exploitive line which
is clearly higher in a v right yeah
which is then very hard for me who plays
against julian who just let's say i play
against you and just see your average
stats and like
looks fine but i don't know because you
will adjust certain hands that are close
based on how i play so then the next
level will be okay based on how i play
how would julian then make the
adjustment and you know when i was
playing a lot of battles battles battles
this is definitely the stuff that you
have to take in consideration but to be
honest uh i think i'm pretty good at
that stuff and with the majority of the
players especially if you don't focus in
on a specific player you don't really
know exactly what's going on so then i
think we should also be honest to
ourselves like okay should i really use
that rng just for the sake of being
balanced against this particular
opponent probably not what people often
do wrong and what you definitely
shouldn't do and i think this is also
something that julian pointed out if you
then for example in a five percent big
spot use the big sizing you have to
definitely look like i said in some
spots it makes sense for value but then
the bloods are less intuitive which
could open you up for an imbalance and
other people could just hero fold
against you or people start to invent a
sizing in a spot that doesn't really
exist
and you probably can relate to this as
well sometimes you'll see player use the
size in a spot where i know this is not
really a thing and when that happens you
can ask the question like
it's not really a thing here would you
be more inclined to size down or size up
with value or bluffs and that's then
where you know especially players you
and me we have a lot of experience
that's definitely where you can start
exploding your opponents and that's why
i think being on balance can really hurt
you
yeah
yeah also like with the stats and stuff
i don't dig too deep into it like i have
my baseline like like the pilot like the
by the fire strategy like the simulator
i look into a few stairs it's like
women's soft flop and when i show them
and i look at people's like red and blue
line and then i look at their aggression
frequencies on flop turns and river and
they dpip and pfr and i basically draw
my conclusions from them so this is like
my my baseline to to analyze an opponent
or like in like a bigger field like
obviously if it's like a wreck battle as
you said then you have to dig a bit
deeper and you really have to look in
like three bed spots and then
percentages and etc under frequencies
and everything but if it's just like you
bring you're playing in a broader pool
like i only look at the w like movement
soft flop one at showdown way to show
them in the aggression frequencies and
then i categorize okay he's tight so he
won't be over bluffing me in this spot
okay this guy is loose uh i have to call
here sometimes so like this is this
could be the spot where i should or can
where you can use an angie so this guy
is over bluffing in a certain spot and i
have a good bluff catcher here and then
i look at the profile of the player
again and said okay he's like his
aggression frequency on the river is way
too high his vp ip is quite high his
free bet is quite high and his red line
is winning so he's fighting for pots so
i would call this player down
here more often as opposed to when the
guy has a 23 v pip and this woman so
flop is 46 right and he's finding this
huge size on the river and he's going
all in a spot where it's hard to have
like natural bluffs and where you have
to have a lot of uh unintuitive plus and
i really have a strong hand but i would
still fold my strong hand because the
guy just never lost right the guy is
playing 12 hours of poker every day he's
bomb hunting he's playing multiple
tables and uh he doesn't have a high win
rate so i'm not gonna call down these
guys for stacks for example this is the
adjustments that i'm doing in-game yeah
you have to realize that that guy is not
there to take your money that guy is
there to take money against the fish and
he happens to get into a pot with the
nuts against you yeah yeah of course of
course then don't call down the tight
guy
so yeah this is indeed a very easy way
to boost your win rate label
the
you know i really like the ones that
drops that as well for the people who
don't know what it is it basically i
mean it says it's it says in a statistic
how often you win the bot when you see a
flop the higher the number the more you
fight for bots the lower the number the
less you fight for bots it's simple as
that so
you can expect a higher one was a flop
player to fight back at you more often
it's not completely black and white that
he is now on the river over blood
obviously it's way more nuanced but i
think while all players especially in
bigger pools do wrong they will add way
more stats to their huds first of all
they will have sample size issues and
then they will start to see and then
they will start to look at specific
spots in in the flop but i think
especially early on in your career
you're then missing the point i think
you should just focus on playing solid
yourself right that's already hard
enough at an earlier stage in your
career and then just use the stats that
i think julian suggested i think they
were perfect to kind of label okay this
guy is a bit more past this guy's bit
more aggressive to help you make better
decisions on your bluff catchers and
then with the aggression especially in
terms of where should my ev come from oh
this guy's very aggressive so let him
bluff but this guy is very passive so i
probably have to do the betting myself i
think from an exploitive perspective
this is probably the way to go when
you're still playing at a
at a lower level yeah and then the next
thing is like understanding the spot
understanding understanding the board
and the ranges so even if the guy has a
movement soft flop of 51 right let's say
easy example it comes like king green
jack 10 right and it breaks out and then
he's betting and over betting and
jamming you have a nine for example or
something like that
this is a spot where even the guy with
the 53 women so flop doesn't have a club
right and then understanding this and
then understanding like all the
different boards how they play out and
where bluffs are actually coming from uh
that's way more important that's way
more important
yeah yeah yeah this is the next thing
but first like take take these few uh
take these few stats and go from there
categorized has a tight passive and then
and then you see okay and the river is
too aggressive i have to call him on the
river he's the passive he's only batting
top air plastic so i can poke my blood
catcher even in piyo or instead and then
in an ideal world uh it would be like a
caller like an indifferent call or
something like that
yeah we'll leave that the rng river
calls up to the to the top then in the
world spelling it out against each other
uh you
you mentioned that you know your advice
is to not give so much complex
strategies you're a coach yourself as
well you do a cfp together with stefan
when you
when you teach poker what are some
characteristics you see in certain
students
that
makes you
makes you think it's more likely that
they will succeed and what are some
tells you have on the students that will
most probably not succeed in your
experience
it's most of the time it's their
initiative and
the time they're spending studying by
themselves or like taking the initiative
and the responsibility for themselves
because i think a lot of guys out there
they're thinking they're joining a cfp
with like good coaches and a good
community and i think that's already
enough to get them to like
nl1k and a 2k level but i think in the
end this is just like this is like a
mentorship this is like a support you
still have to put in your own house you
still have to take the initiative and uh
study by yourself or like find a
studying power like take a fellow
student and use him uh for studying on a
regular basis like because you only have
like one or two one-on-one sessions if
at all in a week but that's not enough
to get you to where you want to get if
you want to become an i1k and a 2k
regular you still have to put in a lot
of work by yourself and then while
you're doing your own work and while
you're doing your own initiative you
will have questions right and then you
write down these questions and then when
you have the one-on-one session with
your coach
you ask these questions but you always
always and our most successful students
they were just like taking care of
themselves they had the initiative they
had the drive they were asked like they
were asking me non-stop questions on
skype and i was always replying so but
it has to come from the student like
trying to push somebody through these
like one or two years or whatever the
contract length is um won't work out
like the initiative has to come from
them the drive and the ambition to make
it has to come from them and then you're
standing there with your best advice
right and then they can come to you and
you give them your best advice or in
worst case your best guess but there's
always somebody they can speak to and
always like a supportive person uh very
close to them like a mentor and then uh
but yeah in the end it has to come from
them like i can't push somebody through
the two years and even if i would do it
after these two years what is this
person going to do right because he's
not he's not really self-sufficient he's
just relying on an external source but
yeah in the end it's uh it's that's the
initiative and it's to realize that you
have to even if you're on a cfp
you have to spend a lot of time by
yourself uh like yeah grinding piyo like
trying to understand sports like trying
to improve and understanding the game
better and then when you when you come
up with questions there that's when you
ask your coach
and then actually if you write down
questions and you make a session out of
these questions or out of these hand
histories for example then it's actually
becoming a really good session like a
really
a good session where you learn things
from where you take things from it's not
like oh [ __ ] i have a session in an hour
with my coach or here like 10 hands i've
lost 10 big pots i've lost and then you
look at like 10 coolers and that there's
no good question
and another thing is ask the right
questions like ask a good question for
example when i speak to linus or when i
speak to marcus i make sure this
question is on point because you also
can't spend these guys with stupid
questions because at some point
they also don't have the time and
they're also like nobody wants to reply
to the stupid question that's if you
think about it by yourself if you take
the time by yourself that you can answer
yourself so like write down good
questions like ask good questions and
don't be too specific about a hand or
spot or ask about like spots that are
coming up more often i think this is uh
this is very important
yeah especially don't waste time on like
for example your post session there's
certain hands you can figure out by
yourself right you can take a look at
the solver it's like oh interesting i
didn't realize the spot played like this
or oh i will look up my
some data oh yeah this clearly spotless
population is under bluffing over
bluffing so i should call more fault
less whatever and but sometimes there
are still hands that despite the solver
despite data despite your experience you
still are like yeah but really is it
perceived like this the solver does it
but i'm not really sure how this works
in practice that's a good hand to bring
to a coaching session yeah right exactly
else elsewhere just uh yeah let me look
at the software the software does this
okay yeah wasted your time the quality
of the quality that you get from a coach
is very dependent on the quality that
you put in yourself for example i
remember when i did
a lot of coaching sessions with jared
like i mentioned i would always make
notes while playing and i would bring
all these notes to the session
and then we have actually had something
to talk about right and i think it's the
same poker strategy wise uh that's very
important you you also mentioned that um
you know you you like doing cfp type of
coaching more than hourly coaching
because you feel like it's more
fulfilling what do you think it it gives
you
compared to hourly coaching for example
yes so with the hourly coaching uh i was
it was like in the end i can be
transparent honestly but like early
coaching was way more profitable uh the
hourly was quite high uh but just people
just come to you they pay their money
right you give them what they want they
get what you want they get what they
want and then they're leaving again and
maybe they come back for a second or
third session but
uh in the end it wasn't really
fulfilling because you didn't know the
person then also in the end how much can
you teach somebody in three lessons
right or like in five lessons and it's
probably not too much so i felt like it
was a little bit
they didn't get the biggest bang for
that buck and i felt like it was the
first time i realized money doesn't
bring me happiness and then i basically
cancelled all like one-on-one sessions
if i give a one-on-one session and it's
like a friend of mine or something or
somebody who's struggling i give it for
free and but the cfp is way more
is way more fulfilling because you have
this two-year contract and you get to
know the person right and it's not only
about the poker knowledge that you're
giving back but it's also about like all
you've experienced uh from life like i
don't know if it's about like nutrition
or books or dating or like dealing with
your parents or i don't know investment
advice like all the mistakes i've done
in my life or all the mistakes i've done
in my 33 years i can give back to
someone i know this person is going to
save time right it doesn't need to take
the person doesn't doesn't need to take
every advice but
uh like if you trust me and if you like
if you okay this is a reliable person
then take the advice and you will you
will save you will save some time and in
the end like that's what i notice of
getting older is like saving time and
like using your time like purposefully
purposefully or usefully this is like a
very big thing i mean when you're young
you feel like you have so many years
left and everything is easy everything
is nice but then you're getting older
you had your first like mental like kind
of breakdown like a tough time mentally
and then all of a sudden your body also
i had so many problems with my body
lately and you realize okay you're a
mortal human being and your time is
limited so
yeah in the end it's about saving time
and creating like a relationship with
the person and like knowing something
about the person and actually like
seeing them succeed in a sense and then
in best case scenario what we did as
well uh with our two former students
there now they became so good in these
two years that we are now discussing the
strategy together right there they're
kind of like coaching me in a sense and
they come up with new ideas and they
have the energy the drive the power and
they they they keep on pushing and this
that's also that's what's pushing me as
well their drive and then we bring
together their new ideas and my
experience and then out of this we can
we can come to good uh conclusions for
sure
yeah that sounds familiar i definitely
have some students that will whoop my
ass now
yeah for sure for sure like not in every
spot but there will be spots that are
playing like a hundred percent better
than i do they have better knowledge
than either that's true that doesn't
mean you did a good job right
we did a good job for sure and like the
other things that i'm doing better i'm
coping better with with downswings i'm
coping better with investments fail and
stuff like that and all these things
that are happening off the table that
are grinding their gears uh i can deal
with those things better that also make
like a big uh impact on the table uh for
sure as well but yeah technically in
like certain spots they're definitely
playing better than me and they're
probably out like me when we face each
other on the tables but it's fine it
feels like uh we did a good job and uh
yeah like it was actually like our our
business model or like what we are doing
is working and it's that's in the end
this is like very fulfilling to see the
money of course yes but in the end
numbers number stuff especially also if
you if you just have a good hourly
grinding yourself right then
i i remember also there was a phase
where actually that was before i started
to play coaching when i was considering
it people would often say yeah but
you're ev blah blah so high and it
almost felt a little bit like okay [ __ ]
so now i'm a successful poker player my
ev so i am not allowed to do anything
else anymore because i cannot can i
justify it because my ev is too high
it's almost like a trap
yeah but you can also only play so so
many hours of poker day right like um
because your hourly will drop when you
play like 16 hours a day or if you play
like six seven eight hours you'll have a
high hourly but then if you spend
something
like because it's like a similar thing
coaching but it's still like in the same
area it's not like all of a sudden you
start day trading or you start going out
and like trying to run a completely
different business it's like a similar
thing and it also helps you to improve
as well right because you also have to
put an extra theoretical work and you
have to prepare sessions and then
what what i'm struggling or like what's
i think it's really difficult about
coaching is to put your own thoughts uh
into words to a guy who's like three or
four levels below you're right to put
your complex thoughts into like quite
easy words like this is something i find
like really challenging but like also
just like expressing your thoughts
putting them into understandable words i
think that makes you understand the
entire strategy or like the things that
you're doing way way way better that's
what's helping me and obviously like the
theoretical work i see more hands
uh i see more spots i see more solutions
than i would be seeing if it was just
for myself so that's also like very
beneficial and make sure you're staying
on top because it's not only for you
it's also for someone else right i mean
you can [ __ ] up your own life and it's
whatever but if you're [ __ ] up
somebody else's life it's it's a big
responsibility so you have to make sure
that every session that or like every
session that i'm giving i'll try to try
to always like give my best and my best
advice and
try to really uh help the other person
for sure
because i know what i'd say
i know what's at stake for them right
because i've been there and i didn't
have help and i know how difficult it is
to make your way up and money is short
bankrupt is short you have expenses you
have downswings and stuff like that so i
know what they're going through and so i
try to always like give my best when i
do a session after like a coaching
session of like an hour one hour 15
minutes i also need a break i need to
take like a while
break it's like my head is spinning
around like crazy but then you see also
like you did something did something
challenge and it's challenging it's
challenging in a way as well and i
really enjoyed
yeah i think it's a very important
skill you could say as a coach to be
very relatable like you you it took you
12 years to get to high stakes for me
as well i think it took like eight nine
we went to a lot of struggles so
whenever you have a student and he's
dealing with something you can say hey i
dealt with that as well go here i'll
give you some advice whereas maybe
if
you were a bit more
let's just call it talented for the sake
and things went
because of that you just have a natural
ability to be good at poker
probably you will have a tougher time
giving advice to struggling students
because you cannot really relate to what
they're experiencing yeah
yeah you see them struggling and you
know exactly what to tell them you know
exactly what they need and this is why
you feel like i don't know if you're
like a father to their son
you're just like you i've been there and
this is what you should do and then
either they take it and if they take it
and you see it's working out it's like
very fulfilling sometimes they don't
take it and they come back a few weeks
later and then they ask the same thing
and then i give the same advice and then
they take it then it's like ah okay
you were right again and this is just
like a nice thing to just like see them
grow and then when you can share
somebody else's success you can be
happier more right because if you can
only be happy about your own success
then you can only be happy so much but
if you can't be happy about someone
who's close to you or somebody have a
you have a good relationship too and you
can be really happy for them if they're
succeeding and all of a sudden it's like
a lot of happiness around you it's all
right but it's a hard point to get there
because a lot of people are oh god he
won 50k today i lost 20k today and then
they're unhappy
but instead of that you could be like
happy for your friend who had like a big
winning day and then share his joy and
then take it over to your life as well
right so i think this is quite a nice
thing as well i think what's what's very
important in order to
to have this kind of experience right to
be happy for someone instead of feeling
envy is you need to have reached a
certain level of success yourself
i think that is probably mandatory to be
able to say the things that you're
currently saying right
yeah and you have to be content with
yourself and you have to be in peace
with yourself and that you you have to
have just little problems on your mind
we always have some problems but to be
happy for someone else you already have
to be like almost like a hundred percent
with yourself and it has to be there
there shouldn't be like any major things
on your mind because if there's major
things on your mind you will be always
thinking about the problems that you
have on your mind but if you're if
you're living in peace and you're living
in kind of like an equanimity and you
take life as it is and you can be happy
with whatever happens or make the best
whatever happens in a day
and then you can be happy for someone
else but if you're struggling with
yourself and if you're unhappy about
this and if you're unhappy about that
and there are so many things on your
mind you're not at the spot where you
can be happy for someone else or you're
also not in a spot where you can take
care of somebody else or where you can
take care of a community you have to be
at a very good place in your life but
yeah you have to pull in the work and
you have to have to come to these
realizations and like go through all
these things to to get to this point but
it's hard but yeah again then through
poker because it's so fast living and we
played so much volume we had so many ups
and downs over the last 10 or 12 years
or whatever we've been there and i think
like yeah i'm at a point where i can
give back a lot or where i can be happy
for other people succeeding or get
happiness from seeing my students
succeed and like having their big
successes and like getting to where they
want
in life this is quite quite a good thing
to see yeah
very very very good stuff adam
i'm sure i mean you have been a
professional poker player before you
switched full-time uh
coach i think this also helps right that
you can relate to the struggles of
players for example
shout out to jared uh
what i sometimes miss with jared is
you know if you talk to a guy who's
actually been there as well who's been a
professional poker player then sometimes
you feel a bit more of a clique
i assume that this really also benefits
in your coaching sessions
yeah i'd say so for me personally i'd
rather speak from experience
and being able to relate to problems
that people are having gives you this
kind of you can put yourself in their
shoes and understand what it was like
the reason i only work with poker
players is because i understand them so
much better than other people by going
to entrepreneurship their traders i
could probably give them good advice but
to be honest i don't know their lives
i've never lived it so uh i haven't got
that authentic experience of being there
but yeah i think obviously you can get
experts who are very very skilled at
their craft and they can give you that
kind of bid eye view that we talked
about earlier that observe a view
without ever going for that experience
but other people going for the
experience gives them that relatability
that allows them go look i've been
through this problem myself what you're
going through i've been there myself and
this is what happened i had to deal with
this way so i think both angles from a
culture perspective can be effective
personally i like to teach through
experience and things i've learned
more so than concepts that i picked up
somewhere else but as a personal
preference
i have some big news my fellow ambitious
poker players because the doors to our
mechanics of poker program are closing
they are closing because behind the
scenes we have been working hard on the

access to all the updates including all
the goodness that is coming up in the
mechanics of poker 2.0 so grab this
opportunity before the doors are closed
and let us help you realize your poker
goals go over to
pokerambition.com to enroll
but without further ado let's get back
to more goodness in this episode
all right a few things i want to go into
so i'm gonna start with the first one
which is
it took you nine years to get to two
cares and twelve years to get to five
cares roughly based on the questionnaire
what would you have to do differently to
get to your five kids in six years to
half that time it took you out of five
cares what would you have done
differently
that's a good question yeah probably
that because i had these lazy periods as
well right like the periods where i
haven't studied where i haven't been
consistent like looking back at it
cutting this out like knowing that i
have to be consistent with the strategy
uh that would be good advice and then
again
have the money ready like i've played 5k
many times and i also sold a lot of
action but still didn't have the role
for it like
be comfortable of like losing like set
yourself like a win loss
as well like if it's going really badly
come back another time like go back go
back to the lower stake make the money
there like learn your lesson and then
come back but have the money have the
money ready i think this is like the
most important thing and just like yeah
again be being consistent and there are
other people there out there they are
smarter and they are fast learners like
i'm not a fast learner and i always have
to learn through experiences for example
like our
our two students they learn so much for
us so they didn't have to make their own
like bad experience as well but i'm
always the guy who's like thinks he
knows it better and then i have to go
through
his bad experience by myself and it
takes time
to get to this point so um yeah in the
end i would say it's like consistent
work have the bankroll ready like set
yourself like a stop loss and then when
you're losing too much then actually
take a break take a step back look at
the look at the mistakes you've made
drop down stakes uh yeah regain
confidence regain the money and then
come back and take take another shot but
um yeah that would be my advice
the lessons that you often need to learn
the hard way by having experience of ups
and downs however guys watching this you
don't need to learn the hard way you can
listen to the old wise people giving you
some advice that yeah being sensible
with your bankroll is a good career move
and it's one of those things that i
think most poker players at some points
are gonna
put themselves in situations that create
financial stress maybe it's just not
your fault it's a downswing yeah being
mindful of your bankroll over and over
throughout your career because i think
what happens is players make progress
and they get to a point where they're
like ah bankroll stuff fix that i'm
doing great now and then they start
shooting a higher stake and they give
themselves uh basically not enough a
bankroll to shoot that or they put
themselves in their short-term financial
stress and before you know it you're
back having to move down stakes which
has held back your progress a lot
because you didn't factor in some
certain variables so yeah i think very
good and then consistency which you've
talked about throughout this
conversation
good work ethic and showing up over and
over so in line with that what are some
of the things you do on a daily basis to
perform at your best what are some
things that your daily habits that allow
you to execute a high level
yeah it's it's a lot of work life
balance these days like i noticed just
like sitting in front of computer all
day and playing poker all day doesn't
give me happiness and doesn't give me
doesn't give me that peace that i need
to play yeah at my stake so it's a lot
of like social stuff i got to know a lot
of people here in the complex that i'm
living and we're doing a lot of things
in the evenings or just like going for a
walk by myself being like physically
active like going swimming going to the
gym meeting friends going for dinners
going for drinks and like doing new
things as well like go to a place go to
a restaurant or go to a museum you've
never been before like travel to the
city like get out of here
get out of here not not like comfort
zone but out of your
like normal routine a little bit in a
sense and then also because when you see
something new you're also i don't know
you're more excited i don't know it's
like it gives you like different type of
energy and different type of impulses
because if you're doing the same thing
all over all over again you're getting a
little bit bored so for me uh to succeed
at the minute is having this like strong
strong work life balance having a social
circle of people like seeing people and
then also whatever happened at the table
like if you meet a friend and you go for
a beer like how much like how hurtful is
your big losing day afterwards right and
they will cheer you up and then you will
speak about something completely else
you can talk some nonsense you talk
about whatever right and then they will
cheer you up as well and then all of a
sudden it's not that bad anymore so like
having this good balance and not getting
like stuck into this little like poker
world but then because in the end if
you're just like playing and playing and
do nothing else uh you think like this
is the most important thing in the world
right i mean if it's going well it's
great and then uh
uh it's great it's cool but like there
will be the downswing will be coming
right and if that's the only thing
you're having in a downswing you're
getting actually in a very bad mental
state and you're getting in a very
destructive
uh mental state as well and then all of
a sudden your entire life is just like
it's awful it's not the best life you
can live so that's what i would
recommend to a lot of people obviously
when you're a low stakes friend or
mistakes brandon you have to build up
the bankroll you have to put in more
hours than i do but again i'm here for
13 years and i've done this uh but still
try to to make time like once or twice a
week to meet your friend like make time
to do sports like three times a week
stuff like that make time to read a book
make time to call your mom all these
kind of things but um have some kind of
balance and it's like the balance is up
to anyone uh individually as well right
some need more or like a bigger
work-life balance and some need less of
a work-life balance but definitely have
other things that you do
instead of poker that's that would be
that would be my big big big advice
because yeah been there with just like
grinding and down swinging and it's a
downward spiral for sure
great advice and yeah i like what you
said that you've got to find that
balance for you it's very different at
different stages of your life and based
on your personality it sounds like for
you right now socializing having new
experiences and creating a life outside
of poker which is fun engaging is really
important to you maybe that was the same
throughout your career i'm sure there's
other phases where it was like grinding
much longer hours and less socializing
less novelty because polka was such a
demanding thing but at the same time is
finding that balance based on your
current goals your current aspirations
and always realizing you do need to
create a life like you can't just have a
poker career that is just my whole day
it's like you've got to create a life
that keeps you happy and for yourself
you're a great model for someone who's
had a really long successful career 12
30 30 years plus and still go on and
still motivate and still almost like
you're in your your first day of the job
that's refreshing and shows that
importance of creating a life around
pork carrot and not just having this
one-dimensional pursuit i speak a lot of
players who are like super hungry super
ambitious and they think the solution is
just to cut everything else out friends
social life gym haven't got time to
exercise because they're too busy
grinding studying and then they always
like want to optimize more and more
variables and i was just like oh for
your personality it's going to be very
counter-intuitive we need to relax you
need to take a step away and do stuff
away from pocket get away from your
computer i'm like no no i don't want to
do more stuff i need to sleep less i
need to hack this and do this so i think
it's understanding for your workaholics
out there i can relate to you for my
younger days you've got to find that
balance so you don't bring yourself out
and you can have a fun life alongside
poker so yeah i think it's a really good
lesson so in your younger days let's say
in the grinding house
how your day is different then let's say
when you're working right with poker
players maybe when you're playing mid
stakes and you were climbing the ladder
i think a lot of players watching this
podcast are listening will be playing on
the ladder either from low tech to mid
sticks or mid to high and they're in
like a hustle mode and they want to get
to that next level for you how your day
is different back in those days
yeah i was just like looking back at i
think the mistake that it was just like
grinding too much like grinding too many
hours and grinding too many tables and
probably not being too selective about
the tables that i was playing uh if you
really want to climb up the snakes you
also have to make time for studying
right and then because just like from
like grinding out hours and hours and
hours uh it doesn't work like that
because you still you still need to
improve you still need to get better so
i think looking back the mistake that
i've made was just like grinding too
much with too little knowledge uh but i
also didn't have a goal basically i was
just like doing the same thing all over
again you just need a direction right
you need to you need to know where you
want to be at a certain time obviously
you can't say like in three years i'm
gonna be a high stakes player but you
have to have a goal and set like a limit
that you want to play and that you want
to have a win rate on rights so you need
to you need to be goal driven because
otherwise you just show up every day and
that's what i did and i was just like
doing it because i did it yesterday so i
was like i'm gonna do it tomorrow and i
wasn't really aware of like what's
happening so like setting a goal what
you want to achieve and also like making
time for studying instead of just like
grinding grinding grinding i think
that's very important because yeah in
the end it's about the path right it's
not about the goal but you need a goal
to to have a direction right
yeah you need to go first to decide the
path to get you there so it's like
exactly
and then make sure you
sorry and then and then make sure you'll
enjoy the path as well because then if
you if you don't enjoy the path if you
don't enjoy the time that you need to
reach your goal it's not like you'll
reach your goal and you'll wake up with
a smile every day rather imagine you go
to university for example four years and
you get your bachelor's degrees but you
really didn't like the four years of
like studying or whatever you did and
you think you will be happy when you
have your bachelor's degrees you will be
happy about your bachelor's degrees for
maybe like a day or two and then all of
a sudden you have your bachelor degrees
and then what's next right and you look
back at four miserable years and it
wasn't really worth it so like have a
direction have a go but also make sure
the path to it or the way to it or the
time you're spending to reach the goal
is enjoyable for you or it's like yeah
yeah very important very important
lesson yeah i think we spend most of our
time pursuing things on the path but at
the end they kind of get the
destinations of very fleeting moments
often we don't even spend the time
acknowledge it and picture anything i
worked long towards i got that outcome
and i was like okay onto the next thing
didn't acknowledge it i've got one of
those degree papers somewhere gathering
dust achievements i've had in my life
it's like oh on to the next thing so if
you're enjoying the path that's the real
thing how can i wake up every morning
loving my days i think i had an
interview with steph curry recently the
basketball player and they were going
how are you so consistent how do you
always put so much time into your craft
and he goes i love my days i love my
days i think that's a really good thing
it's like i what that really means is
he's on the path towards the goals he
wants he loves the path he loves the
pursuit when you do that you find that
blend for yourself you don't need
discipline you don't need someone with a
whip you don't need consequences because
you're enjoying the pursuit so when
you're younger take some time to figure
out what the path is you might be some
trapped doors on the way and some some
go off track occasionally but i think
always thinking okay what's my thing i'm
aiming for and how can i create ideas
and a path to that which i enjoy the
process of i think it's good
yeah all right i want to ask you about
emotions so you touched on your career
punching screens smashing mice and then
you also touched on the fact that you
would say you're probably better than
your peers at handling your emotions now
so i want to touch on some of the things
you may have done to uh go from this guy
who's smashing the screen to being very
zen-like or at least in control of your
emotions relative to other players in
your group what's the things that have
been important for you to get a handle
on your emotions whilst being a poker
player uh i think what helped me quite a
lot was uh jared teddler's book the
mental game of poker uh yeah to
understand where your emotions coming
from and to understand that it's natural
and it's also like when you're reading
your book you're also learning a lot
about yourself as well right it's like
kind of like a self-help book and you
have to all these like little exercises
and as we've mentioned before you're
just like writing down your thoughts and
you're writing down your emotions and
then all of a sudden you're reflecting
on it and then at some point it's making
sense right like in the end it all makes
sense that these emotions are happening
because you play and when you play you
want to win right you don't want to lose
or you don't want to draw you want to
win but in poker it's just the thing you
can't always win because there's always
basically probability so uh making peace
with that and understanding where my
emotions coming from
that definitely helped me a lot then
obviously getting older being more
experienced like realizing okay this
cycle is gonna happen over and over
again like now this is not the last time
uh but there will be better times coming
as well
i think that's quite important and then
obviously i guess i'm already 33 the
tesla's the wrong levels they're
they're probably already dropping a
little bit so having less tesla's thrown
up but just like having more experience
have a bigger bankroll have more comfort
and have more confidence in general and
know that things will go a certain way
after some time and it's just a cycle
it's the same as on the stock market or
with crypto it's like now we're in a
bull market but we know we know there's
gonna be and having this this confidence
of like knowing that things will be good
again or having this
certainty that things will be going good
again at some point and then depending
on how much work you're you're spending
on improving it will go you will come
faster to the times when things will be
better right just like having the
certainty that this is not gonna be the
status quo and that chaos is not the
status quo and there will be good times
coming again you have to push through
learn your lesson improve and then
there were there's another day when the
sun is shining right
great stuff yes i think the first avenue
there for you was reflecting uh jared
taylor's book was a great kind of in
point for you to go into yourself and go
for the exercise that he maps out in his
book and then experiencing and there's
no substitute in life or experience and
i like at the end point you've come to
the same wisdom where you realize
everything's a cycle there's a great
principles by ray dalio and he talks
about cycle and things just another one
of those you know another cycle that
goes up goes down it goes back to
normality sometimes we're in the chaos
of a down and we're like ah not
realizing it's gonna come good again
it's like the sun comes up sun goes down
kind of analogy but it takes a while to
get that point especially when emotions
are involved because emotions kind of
paint a lens that this is what life's
going to be like if you wake up
depressed or low energy like life sucks
not this next hour sucks not this
emotion emotions gonna pass by it's like
my life sucks right now and we need to
get past that and realize wait a second
this emotion is gonna pass this phase of
my life it's gonna pass it's gonna be
another cycle on the other side there's
gonna be some good times however i've
gotta embrace going for these tough
times some lessons to learn often a lot
of lessons to be learned i don't want to
say rush through this this negative
periods and yeah i think wisdom of
understanding it's going to come back
around in a good way and you're going to
learn from me to come up with a side so
i think that's a a really important one
i know myself if i get caught in emotion
if i can like talk before observe that
emotion you just realize it's gonna pass
it's gonna pass like it's like it's not
gonna last forever it's gonna be gone
before i've even
took time to to notify it so i think you
understand that emotions don't and i
still cling on to them the other thing
emotions last a long time and i like
when you talk about pushing things down
and putting the monster under the rock
and them growing it's the same with
emotions that you push them down and you
don't you suppress them over and over
they aren't going anywhere for a long
time they're going to blow up in
different ways and they may carry around
for a long part of your life but if
you're experiencing emotions you're
actually with an emotion they're very
quick like they're on a short time frame
relatively to a
kind of your life so i you can get
through many emotions very quickly if
you experience them so good stuff i like
that yeah
the pain will come suffering is optional
right you know that the downswing is
gonna be coming but if you suffer from
if you're making a burst and it actually
is if you don't see it for what it is
then it's even more it's like harder to
endure but if you know it's going to
come and you know how it's going to be
you know it's going to pass
yeah yeah
yeah yeah you don't there's an equation
for that something like suffering equals
pain times by resistance or something so
how would you resist the situation yeah
equal suffering so the pain is given
the pain if you resist the pain you
suffer if you let the pain come through
you you're okay so yeah great stuff all
right i want to touch on a few uh things
that you talk about uh favorite books
because you talk about the certain time
of your life where you were doing
introspective work for your 2015 2016
time you really dig in deep in yourself
and we've talked about poker books like
jerry tenness and the game of poker is
there any other maybe i would say the
poker that had a big impact on your life
yeah it's definitely um i was reading as
a man thinketh uh i think it's from paul
allen it's a very old one it's like a
hundred years old like i tried to read
it in english but i only went through
three pages so i bought it in german so
i definitely recommend this one it's all
only like 90 pages but get it in your
and get it in your mother language don't
read it in english because it will be
impossible this that this one had a
really big impact because it's about
like
seeing things positive instead of
negative and that negativity leads to
nothing and positivity basically leads
to everything right like if you have
negative energy like it will get you to
certain places but it will get you to
the wrong places and negative limits
negative energy is also limited whereas
positive energy will get you to the
right place and will make you meet the
right persons and it's also unlimited
right because if you're sharing positive
energy i will also come back to you and
then it's just like it's unlimited so
that one was really good uh then i was
reading uh both of jordan peterson books
12 rules for life and 12 more rules for
life uh i think he has like very strong
opinions but he's also
he knows so so many different things and
he's he's digging down deep on so many
topics so i would really recommend this
one and then there was another book from
there carnegie how to make friends and
influence people i believe it's called
it's also like i like these old books i
like books that are like 100 years old
because it's not like just like how you
say it's like a fad that's coming up or
it's like a hype that's coming up or
like here the five secrets of happiness
or like in two weeks to a six-pack like
all these these bullshitting books
they're coming out now so i really like
uh the wisdom from my gold uh like
people that that were really successful
this one really helped me a lot uh yeah
to make friends and how to make friends
and what are actually people looking for
looking like because
a lot of people that i just say oh but
i've noticed that you put out your
instagram story right and then you're
waiting for somebody to reply and you're
just like putting out things
and putting out things but in the end to
really get attention to like to get like
really attention and affection from
people you have to ah you have to ask
them how how it's going for them and
what they are doing and then they will
be speaking right now returning to you
and then all of a sudden when you give
more than you expect and then people
will turn back to you right if you're
nice to them and you're asking them for
their opinion on what's on your mind
they will eventually come back to you
it's not like you're putting out your
instagram story of the picture at the
beach obviously you will get a reply but
it's not going to be long lasting
because people there just like replying
because they're seeing something else so
it's not like really in-depth so uh this
book was also really good and there are
a few there are a few more i can't think
of right now but maybe we can put like i
can write down a list and maybe you can
put it into the into the youtube link
here i think that's the best fight if i
give my favorite books out that help me
a lot and
that's quite helpful yeah we'll do that
we'll do that we'll get another stuff
you will oh
audience enjoy that
yeah and then there was a big audio eye
there's one big audio book it's on
audible but probably on other um like
audio audio apps as well uh it's called
uh buddhism for beginners uh by jack
cornfield and uh yes i think it's like
nine or eleven hours and i'm still
listening to it because like he's like a
monk and he's like like telling some
personal stories and telling some like
uh teachings of the buddha
and i think there was so much wisdom on
it i was reflecting on a lot and the
examples and the stories that he's
giving they are so simple but there's so
much truth in it and i took a lot away
from this like from like the teachings
from the buddha or like the bible even
like i was reading or listening to some
interpretations of the bible and these
these stories are like two three
thousand years old but they are still
around and there's a reason why they're
still around because there's so much
truth to it
so yeah that was like quite helpful for
me as well for sure
listen great book suggestions we
intelligent from even from that list
that you're a very deep thinker and
you're on this you're searching for
wisdom like things that have lasted this
long like a long time it's very easy to
call them the gimmicky new strategies
new approaches but often if we go deeper
into like things that have survived
literally hundreds of years and people
are still reading them today there's a
good chance that what they're saying is
universals into the human psyche the
concepts of being human or they
understand something at a high level
which is not going to go away and yeah i
think as a man thinking it's very
similar to uh think and grow rich like
kind of popular one from that genre
where like controlling your thoughts and
the energy of your thoughts and
depends on how deep you want to go this
concept but it's very black and white
and simple to me in terms of if you're
thinking positive things you're
generally going to go down lifelines
that correlate with that on the flip
side you're thinking negative all the
time you're going to be the unlucky
person who's always ending up in unlucky
scenarios and tough situations so
regardless how much law of attraction
you believe in there's definitely things
going on with that concept where which
can't be denied so yeah i think azam i
think it's a very short version of how
to uh understand the thought process and
thinking ways that help you then how to
make friends and influence people i
think it's a great book i think everyone
should read that especially if you want
to have a good social life and one of
the key takeaways i got from that book
was kind of what you touched on and
basically people are way more interested
in themselves than they are in you
regardless what you do you could be the
most interesting person in the world to
yourself they don't care ask them five
questions about themselves they're much
more likely to talk to themselves i
think that when myself when i could
picture myself when i learned this
concept i was in social scenarios you
know i used to think what can i tell
them about myself i was like oh nobody
cares all they care is themselves so i
can ask them questions so then they need
to freeze it because then you can just
ask open questions and be interested in
the people and all of a sudden they're
interested in what you're doing later on
like once you've actually engaged that
process so i think it's a good like life
lesson it's understanding human nature
that we are that's not going to change
everyone's interest in themselves with a
self-interested narrative going on and
if you want to be a social person you've
got to play the play by the rules and be
the person who asks questions
all right great stuff so any uh i should
actually renee any books for you would
suggest we're gonna do a book list maybe
i can cook with some as well any books
that i've had a powerful event in your
life
um
actually the first the first ever
self-help book that i ever read was
miracle morning by hal elrod if i'm not
mistaking
uh that basically
sets sort of the domino and action of
reading other books because there you're
gonna have learned like hey it's like
when the morning we're in the day oh if
you do this sort of things so it's like
the concept of oh wait you actually have
a control over how your day is gonna go
if you do these things in the morning
you know
that like that mine says like
interesting and then i think actually
the second book was the law of
attraction which i think if you read the
real law of attraction book a lot of
people are gonna be like oh yeah sure
yeah sure wait ask for the universe and
the universe will deliver like that got
a little bit of a bad rep right but then
like more think and grow rich as a man
think it uh
a lot of joe dispenza stuff
there they go a little bit more deeper
into that topic and that's definitely
you know positive energy i'm a big fan
of uh other books principles from ray
dalio i think you already mentioned i
think definitely uh definitely must read
all the books from
ryan holiday
i think he has four by now
five four four
oh good especially obstacles the way
which is probably a theme of this
podcast
uh yeah just this came up now from the
top of my mind
actually i wanted to it was interesting
that at some point you came to the
conclusion you said also i was lacking a
goal because you were mentioning that
you were a bit too lazy right why why
why they took 12 years not six and you
say i was lazy didn't study enough but i
then actually wrote down it's probably
because the lack of a goal and then
later you said actually but i really
didn't really know where i was going so
i think that's so important because
the the how i remember my career at some
point i met met up uh with explode and
he was always he was saying go guys
we're gonna try to become the best so it
was me explode poker kluka and i never
really had that goal before so then what
you're doing is you're just doing enough
to get by right you have to pay your
bills i was just living i was playing
poker two to live and when there was a
bigger goal you suddenly think oh
becoming the best okay well what would
we have to do in order to become the
best and then suddenly like studying is
obviously yeah it's obviously part of
that right hiring coaches putting in the
hours uh looking at strategy from
various various uh perspectives so gto
exploitative nda et cetera because you
have a goal right and the more important
that goal is so the more important the
why behind the goal the more it's going
to determine if
you have to push yourself forward
towards the goal or if you're going to
get put towards the goal right how
important is that goal for you on a
deeper level except for just making
money right
so i think that's if if you're lacking a
little bit of motivation and you're
trying to push yourself to we have to
really push yourself towards
studying and towards showing up probably
have to take a
good look at where you're going and why
i think that's probably the main
takeaway
that
i got from why it took you 12 years and
not six
it was yeah didn't have a y or didn't
have yeah i didn't have the direction uh
yeah these days i think i'm i'm way more
i'm way more clear i like i know my
position in the poker world and i know
that i'm not not like a top 20 player i
know that i'm not do would be doing well
right now at the minute like a 10k rack
battle or something so i'm avoiding it
i'm also at the middle i'm traveling a
lot and there's a lot of things
happening at the minute so i know i i
can't jump into these games and think i
will have success so i know that like
when i was younger i would have probably
seen the game would be like i'll be
tempted to play and let's see what's
gonna happen but now i know i know the
games that i'm playing right now i'm
beating that i'm good at them or maybe
i'm one of the better players at them um
but to to make the next step but like
i'm not sure if i even want to make the
next step but we'll make the next step
of like trying to become like one of
these like top 30 or top 20 players i
don't know
if i want to do this um because i have
to put a lot of work and it has to be
less traveling and less less social
activities for sure so i'll see see when
summer's over and then
but it's important to know who you are
like where you're standing and like not
try to to play above your limit or
uh think you're one of the best and then
try to compete with them because there's
not many good things will be happening
no and other things right now are more
important in your life right you try to
live your day-to-day which is according
to your goals and like you said if you
want to go battle linus and stefan at
10k yeah you probably have to alter what
you do on a daily basis in order to get
there and in this case for example that
would be
mean satisfy uh sacrificing maybe some
traveling that you're really enjoying
and then this was actually also a point
that we touched on right about
you have to be happy with your
day-to-day and i think it was in the
podcast with johan right where he said
the moments where i spew the hardest is
moments in my life where i'm just not
happy and a spew is
his body sort of telling him like hey
i'm not happy right now i don't want to
play poker so i'm just gonna spew off i
thought that was very very very big
wisdom do you know do you know something
similar like when you're not happy
and it's almost like a sport a form of
self-sabotage your your body starts to
sabotage itself because it doesn't want
to be here playing poker right now
yeah i noticed one thing and i was
reading about it uh in jordan peterson's
book as well and he was like there was a
topic about like if you're a flat or if
the space that you're living in is not
organized and clean you will also not
you're also your faults won't be
organized and you'll also have turmoil
in your head and i was like i thought
that was quite interesting like i was
struggling with it because i was always
living share but now living by myself
the first thing i do in the morning is
make my bed and then clear up my room
like my flat here right like that make
sure there's nothing there's like no old
cups or there's like the floors vacuumed
and everything is like clean and tidy uh
because that because when i walk in 20
times and you see this chaos you see
like an old cup or you see like an old
glass or like your clothes they are
they're lying around on the floor on the
couch this also doesn't give you
like this peace of mind uh and it's
reflecting on your situation in your
head as well and then sometimes i
realize okay it's not as tidy as i want
it to be in here and then i'm thinking
what about your head and then i see
what's going on in my head and it's just
like my head and my thoughts are
spinning around so this is something i
do on a daily basis uh for me like keep
the flat clean keep keep everything tidy
like make sure every morning spend like
10 minutes so they're just like having
it the way i want it to be and then i
have like clarity in my thoughts as well
and then i can walk in a few times take
a break from a session get a coffee get
a drink and everything is the way i want
to be and i come back and everything is
calm in my head i think this is
something i do on a regular basis or
like on a daily basis basically every
day
interesting interesting concept is
definitely within your control
if you're living alone i would say that
i am the disorganized one in our house
my wife is more like you she before she
starts she wants everything to be
organized so i sometimes she has to go
do something and i see her clean the
whole house i'm like
okay what weren't you supposed to go do
that but she cannot start without the
the place being clean i have the same
with my my desk my office has to be
clean but around that you know i don't
see it as long as around my screen my
desk and that's everything tidy then i
can just do my thing but maybe i'm not
aware of other mess around influencing
the quality of my thoughts so hey maybe
something to to to give a try i wanted
to touch on one more thing also when you
also mentioned well why it took 12 years
not six you were talking about
that you know you were maybe just
playing too much
again i think we can relate this to the
goal
when you have a big goal a question you
should always ask yourself when you play
a session is how can this session
contribute to me achieving my goals
right every session is a little step
towards your goal and when you don't
have a big goal and when maybe at this
point in your career
from a money perspective you were also
already satisfied you weren't really
grinding with a certain purpose so what
that happens is you adjust autopilot you
will not be engaged whereas if you're
trying to become the best your brain is
like okay we're trying to become the
best i'm trying to become better oh this
is this is the new spot that i'm working
on you're looking for new spots to
improve you're way more engaged so all
the sessions that you will play are
going to be quality instead of quantity
i think this is a very important
point for people who are doing a lot of
autopiloting you need
a purpose you need a goal and you need
to always ask yourself how can this
session contribute to that goal and try
to show up in a way that will help you
get towards that goal so that was like
the last piece of advice any any final
words on that before we uh
oh but you're summarizing quite well i
have to say it's hard to add something
uh how to add something purposefully
it's very good i like it you you also
mentioned that currently you know you're
not really sure if you want to try to
take a shot at trying to become top 20
top 30 rack mainly because of the
sacrifices so what are
what are the main reasons you play poker
right now like what are your
main goals in poker right now
yeah the main goal is like to to um keep
up the status score obviously like i'm
playing for the ma like first i'm
playing to actually be better than
yesterday and like to enjoy the time
that i'm playing but obviously there's a
monetary incentive behind it as well
like my goal is to like to make the most
money i can do uh with like the least
stress so i like i don't like variants
at the minute i don't want to go on big
downstream so that's why i'm boarding uh
these like these wrecked battles and
stuff because again like i'm on and off
here and then you have like a big losing
there you have like a bad stretch
because the edges are so small
and i don't want to lose a lot of money
and then go on a holiday because i know
i can't enjoy my holiday so for the
minute it's like to keep the variance at
the bare minimum to play like soft games
or to play games where i know i'm at
least the second best rack at the table
and um yeah to invest as much money as i
can to be financially like free or like
financially independent at some point
where i have like less stress and uh
yeah where i don't need to grind as much
anymore and then where i have more time
to like think about the things that i
might want to do after or like the
things of like how to help more people
or to have like a bigger impact on
society or at least like have a bigger
or better impact on my friends and
family or like the people that are
important to me so for the minute it's
really just like enjoying myself on a
daily basis enjoying the sessions that
i'm playing making sure i'm not playing
too much making sure i'm playing the
right stakes where i'm one of the best
players and then if i have more time or
if i'm willing to sacrifice more time
maybe i'll take a step at the big game
but i have to make this decision i
really like it the way it is at the
minute but i also know i'm probably not
gonna like in half a year or like in one
year's time if i keep on playing the
same stake and like keep on not having
this like challenge or this like goal
that i'm striving to
outsource maybe that competitive nature
right that we talked about all the way
in the beginning of the podcast like how
do you then try to find within the
current grant how do you then find
ways to satisfy that competitive nature
and still i mean the the games that i'm
playing it's it's not like they're very
easy games but people they're actually
very good at poker and it's still like
very compelling like still super
competitive at these games so for the
minute with like the time and energy i'm
having i'm fine with that and i'm fine
with that kind of competition but as
soon as i have more time or as soon as
i'm willing to spend more time into
studying and more time to play bigger
games there will be obviously i will be
looking for a bigger competition but for
now for the minute i'm fine with it and
i'm willing to have like
less of this like uh yeah this feeling
of every day i need to compete i need to
compete i let this a little bit on the
side but therefore i'm having like i'm
having like holidays or like i'm going
on trips with my friends or having some
time off or
yeah just have more free time and then
it's especially for me not having these
huge swings will also like help me to
have like a better quality free time
because uh yeah when you step into the
ring with the big boys the swings will
be big and then you're off time and they
are everything else besides the table
your social life will also be like
ideally it shouldn't but i know it will
affect me a little bit for sure um yeah
so for now it's fine but for the future
uh i'll give it uh i'll see how i feel
see if i enjoy whatever like see enjoy
enjoy this like big
uh this big work life balance where
poker is not the main thing anymore
where i enjoy like meeting people and
stuff and like i don't know taking time
to do a lot of sports and to take time
to read books because maybe i feel like
i want to do a little bit more poker and
then i'll probably give it another shot
for the minute again it's good for the
future for half a year on a year's time
i don't know we'll see and i'll try to
make my best my best decision for sure
yeah i think that's all we can do right
uh what is important to us changes and i
think yeah we're especially in in the
life situation
uh that we are at we are fortunate that
we can adjust our strategies or how we
approach on a day-to-day basis based on
how we're currently feeling at that
moment yeah um
in poker what is something that you're
excited about now strategically let's
say we do uh we hop on a coaching call
tomorrow or it is a strategy call and
like wacko this is a spot i'm so excited
about
let's talk some strategy about the
situation any situation that comes up
that that has uh intrigued you
yeah i'm always a bit excited but also
always a bit nervous when i see the
stefan guy all of a sudden having like
four or five different race sizes and
then all of a sudden he's three betting
smaller and he's having like three
different three betting sizes and he's
four different open brace sizes and then
all of a sudden he starts betting like
200 pop like i think it's like very
interesting and sometimes i'm wondering
if there's like a big intention behind
it or if he's sometimes just like
freestyling or like taking the momentum
that he's having in a game and when he
knows he can run over people that he's
doing that um so like it's very
interesting to see him and i'm curious
what's gonna happen because like the
other guys like marcus and uh linus they
they kind of like stick to their
strategy they're not deviating as much
but this guy he always seems to there's
always something new that he's doing i'm
always wondering has that a purpose is
that good will this be working out in
the toughest games and then if it's
working out all of a sudden you have
like a new era of poke all right then
all of a sudden it seems like the gto
approach the solver based biosolver
approach is done
and we go past that point and all of a
sudden we play these like super complex
strategies with three different sizes
but maybe he's just freestyling maybe
he's i don't know what he's doing
uh maybe he's just using again the
momentum in a session and maybe when
he's running over people he like starts
to use make like make the best out of
his image and like just like betting big
and stuff i don't know but uh like i
always like try to see him and get some
inspiration from what he's doing and
then yeah seeing it and then questioning
myself or like speaking with the team in
the background like is this really good
what he's doing can we implement it is
that is that really something that makes
sense or is it just him being a bit
crazy or him just like sun running or
maybe bedroom bad running who knows who
knows
yeah it's a very thin liner when i see
hands off very sweet or stefan it's like
okay is this genius or just madness i
think i think there was a comment made
like this hand is either seen on 10 no
or 10k now you know in the middle you
don't see this hand it's 10-0 or 10k now
and when it's at 10 now you're like and
also i see some hands that if i would
see my student do the time dude what the
[ __ ] man seriously take it seriously but
what they are doing is you're like okay
i guess you know you you give this some
respect that there's a fall process
behind it that i just don't understand
yeah of course and you always it's like
because back to that i was always like
yeah like i saw him that these guys i
played i put it to the silver and then
all of a sudden someone was saying badly
plain i was like yeah come on these guys
they can't be that good but nowadays i'm
always asking myself like what's the
what's the point behind it right like
what's their thought behind it and why
did he play a certain way because then
you can actually learn from this right
because if you're just saying oh but he
played it badly and look at the solver
you don't learn anything but if you're
coming with like an open approach and
like trying to figure out why you did it
or what's behind it or what's the reason
behind it i think then you can actually
and you can actually learn from it
yeah that that actually makes a lot of
sense speaking it when you're at the
tables
uh
do you have
maybe like a current
sort of nemesis you don't have to say a
name but
what what type of player
is this nemesis and what is it about
this type of player that you find
hard to play against or that triggers
you
um at the minute i would say so when i
play these 5k games on acr i think the
best player who's playing it obviously
they're sometimes playing 464 sometimes
in these games but i think uh davey
jones uh he has improved a lot a lot a
lot um because i remember when he came
up like three years ago or something i
think he made the transition from heads
up or two years ago
he wasn't that good and there were like
clear flaws in this game
but uh yeah what's annoying about him
like well what's annoying in general
about these like good players they put
on the pressure in all all type of spots
right they will find the bluff on an a
size spot whereas like a mid stakes or
like a 1k 2k player
he won't find the unnatural platform
like an ace high dry board and um yeah i
mean these guys work ethic they're
sitting there every day and they're
performing every day and their results
are really great
and yeah what's so good about them again
that they find the unintuitive bluffs on
the balls where where like most of the
populations end up laughing and then you
sit there you have a bluff catch and you
don't know what to do right and then
yeah you always knew what to do but then
suddenly david jones shows up and like
yeah
yeah maybe get that rng out
the rng that i'm not using and then
you're lost a little bit yeah he's
definitely like in the games that i'm
playing at the minute like up to 5k he's
definitely uh one of the best ones and
then obviously daryl is playing them as
well and i regard him as a like
definitely as like a top five wreck at
the minute like him davey jones and
there's linus and marcus and
uh obviously there's some russian guys
in there like stefan for example this
aurora guy and they're all like pretty
good
they're very tough to play like they all
have their own style but um like in a
way that they know how to play their
strategy and they know how they come
across at the table so it's like really
tough to play it against these guys and
then i think at like 2k and stuff
there's nobody really like standing out
from the crowds or where i feel like oh
god this guy
this guy is beating me up or i have a
tough time against this guy it's more
like these like top 10 guys top 15 guys
that are really
putting the pressure on they're going
different ways and they know more and
they're playing the spots better than i
do and stuff so
yeah there's definitely a gap uh once
you play 5k there's a there's a player
who's only playing these games that make
your life way tougher than uh than a 1k
or 2k that that is for sure it's you you
mentioned and that's actually something
that i still really like about poker
they all have their own styles right
like you can like many many strategies
can be plus a fee how you actually the
strategy is going to determine how plus
v of a player you are what do you think
is something about your strategy that
or your approach that gives you an edge
so i have to give away my little secrets
here
no i mean in the end there are no no big
secrets i think in the past i've played
a little bit of a more crisis strategy
like the last two years two and a half
years i played extremely aggressive and
was like over frequencing in most of the
spots and i think it has worked out for
me
nowadays or especially like last year
for example i noticed that people have
picked up on this and i got called down
left and right and left and right
so uh i've like toned down the the
aggression a little bit like the
frequency uh i decreased them a little
bit and um yeah that's what i've been
doing at the minute just like looking
for better spots to be aggressive and
not being overly aggressive in every
spot and obviously sacrificing a little
bit of my redline that i used to that
used to be like the determination of my
strategy yeah you have to have a winning
redline then you're playing a good
strategy
but then again there are guys who have
like a winning redline strategy like
stefan and linus but then all of a
sudden there's a guy like barry sweet
coming in and his rob his red line is
completely dropping because he has a
completely different different approach
to poker so uh yeah in the end it's
about what i've said before as well is
like understanding the game
understanding the players and
understanding the spots and like picking
the spots where you go for where you're
bluffing a lot and then picking the
spots where you know this guy will call
second pair again and then if you know
he's called second pair for stacks again
then you just like jam second pair with
a better kicker for value
instead of like over bluffing the bottom
range like continuously and just getting
caught everywhere so this is something
i've been doing lately or like spending
more time with like see the spots see
what the guy is doing and see his
frequency of calling down if he's
calling me down to light i will jam uh i
will jam a little bit tighter or like if
he's calling me down with uh
like a third pair all the time i'll jam
second half of value instead of taking
the bottom of my range and bluffing it
all in right but then again you're off
the solver completely again
and uh yeah
west you're the white wide western and
all of a sudden uh yeah it's a new
strategy it's a new game that you're
playing but it's interesting and that
makes poker interesting whether you're
always changing and you're always like
trying to improve your approach and uh
not doing the thing that you did a year
ago because obviously it's not gonna
work out anymore because people have
become better right
yeah i think it's also a misconception
about redline i mean it really depends
on your approach and i think also
there's certain players where i redline
more against a certain players where our
blue line more against them and i do
understand what you like if you take
three years ago four years ago
uh the average player was
more passive and more willing to fault
than the current day player so i
definitely
would say the same as you that there's
more players now who
i try to run over a little bit less
and i'm more forced to make tougher call
downs uh if i compare my stats in the
past to now in the past i would bluff
more i guess on average and would fall
more on average and now it's like maybe
bluff less than average and fold less on
average but this is just an adjustment
to the modern name player who's way more
into piyo and who's way more aggressive
way that's willing to fold so you know
you're just adjusting to the games and
obviously you know sometimes you still
see a rack in a game that's like hey
this is the guy i can pound on nice
finally
but yeah it's it's it became a bit more
the exception than whereas in the past i
think it was more the rule right that
people were just too passive and too
much folding yeah these days it's a bit
more merch right you're you're merging
your value range a little bit more and
then if there's a guy calling too much
you're putting in like more like thinner
value if the guy is overfolding a little
bit you're just adding more plus to it
right this is basically the entire
adjustment
all right guys that's poker in a
nutshell
easy
easy game
all right
we're
we're quite long i think we're gonna
wrap it up do you have any further
questions adam
no okay from my ends i just like to
thank julian for being so open and
sharing so much wisdom with our audience
have you got any better words yourself
julian that you'd like to share with our
audience yeah first of all thanks for
having me thanks for having me i really
enjoyed it and i already said it to
renee before like like i like how you
prepare this podcast right you're like
actually like super prepared you're
sending in this questionnaire and then
you get to know the person that you're
interviewing better then you always have
something to talk about and i really
enjoyed that it was going so in depth
and that we're like digging deep and
like yeah giving giving back some of our
wisdom to like even some younger people
that are listening and like making them
life a little bit better and i also like
that it's not just about poker it's also
a bit about life because in the end like
life and pokemon also it can be a little
bit correlated as well
and yeah in the grand scheme of things
like the life and like the wisdom that
we take from this more important than
poker so i really enjoyed it i really
enjoyed the conversation it's like three
hours now and i'm starting to struggle
as well to find the right words but uh
yeah again thanks for having me and i
had a really really really good time
what a great conversation with julian
that was as always adam what were your
main takeaways what did we learn from
julian
i was very impressed with julian i
thought he had a lot of wisdom and a lot
of experience that he's gained the hard
way so to speak 12 years to get to his
ultimate outcome of playing 5ks
regularly and there's a lot of
great wisdom that he's learned
throughout that time that he was kind
enough to share with us throughout this
conversation one thing that came across
was his kind of holistic approach to
life and poker he almost treats
everything as fitting into this kind of
balanced perspective where he's got
relationships in there he's got his
daily habits he's got exercising he's
got how he's showing up on a daily basis
and he talked about that story in his
career when his relationships went
really badly and poker instantly went
badly as well he went into depression i
think as a poker player it's really good
to remember where a piercing first and a
poker player seconds and we can't
compartmentalize them we can't go poker
is this and then my life's a mess over
here and he talked a lot about the chaos
get getting good going through the chaos
sounds getting everything in place even
towards the end he was talking about um
make sure his environment is really tiny
so his mind is very tiny so i i like how
holistic he was talking about life
overall and poker and he was also trying
to keep things simple even when he
taught a poker strategy for a long time
he's talking about keep it simple until
you get to uh the masters level on the
real high high level make it simple make
your life simple clear your room clear
your space and make your strategies um
as simple as you can next thing was
reflecting he spent a lot of time
reflecting on
his weaknesses as a person overall he's
always a guy who's seeking wisdom he's
reading very deep books that have been
around for a long time but i found him
someone who's done a lot of
self-exploration and coming to terms
with his kind of dark side and his
insecurities and he had a patch of his
life where things weren't going so well
i know like we're talking to him in this
current day and things are going great
for him he had long patches where things
weren't going well and he was almost in
a depressive state and things weren't
progressing and he had to take a real
deep hard look at himself and reflect on
what wasn't working he saw some things
that he didn't really like and he didn't
back away so he talked about meditation
being a really important habit for him
and he got good at observing his
thoughts observing his reactions to
things and he started realizing wait a
second i'm not showing up in the way i
want to which then took us to those
store concepts of controllable variables
and once you realize you're not showing
up in a certain area you've got two
options you can either keep going the
way you go in and ignore it or you can
start immediate head-on and go wait a
second i control these variables how i'm
showing up daily is my job i can start
improving this and we talked about over
and over that i could kind of his drive
to be better i'm training to be better
and i think it was really good had the
conversation started with sports and i
went to gaming and then went to poga and
the trend lines was coming through the
whole time of always being be getting
better and learning from your
experiences but even seeing that there
was a patch in the middle where he kind
of went off the rails a bit way he
wasn't progressing so yeah there's so
many lessons there but i feel it was a
really wise guy and i'll be replaying
this for myself to listen to it to uh to
take more notes how about yourself renee
what was the top three takeaways
yeah i thought he was a role model for
what this podcast stands for right to go
through your career where you face
obstacles and learn lessons
through the obstacles that you face and
i mean that's his mindset right he was
conscious and continuously looking for
opportunities in moments of adversity
what's this moment trying to teach me
how can i become better apparently i
wasn't as good as a player or as good as
a person as i thought i was that's okay
now i'm gonna try to make progress
indeed like the work ethic that he took
from gaming from sports
there he learned okay we should just try
to continuously get better he's starting
to apply that to poker as well i thought
a very important takeaway was the goal
right that was something that when you
asked him why did it take 12 years not
six not something that he mentioned
straight away but later he came to that
well i guess also i didn't really have a
goal he said that he was lazy studying
didn't didn't wasn't really focused
while playing but that was all because
he didn't have a purpose was probably at
the end you know he already grinded a
little bit the money part was a bit
satisfied from the perspective of
satisfying his environment showing that
you know he was good enough that his
career choice was a good decision that
was probably also satisfied so at this
moment i think he just needed a new
sense of purpose that could make him
excited and that makes him care about
this upcoming session again right so i
think in general that's always a very
important takeaway
uh indeed looking for
controllable things within the chaos
captain coming back
also knowing that what you're going
through at this moment is temporary and
it will pass right that was also a very
very big takeaway
uh yeah i mean
a lot of goodness but these were a
couple of points that i that i wrote
down
