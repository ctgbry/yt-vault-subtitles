what's up guys it's adam karma here and
i'm the mindset and performance coach
for poker ambition over the past few
months myself and renee have been
working hard to provide you guys with
the best content and coaching
experiences to turn you into the best
poker players you can be rene will

[00:16]
poker players you can be rene will
continue to provide you with expert
strategy and technical knowledge and i'm
going to start producing more mindsets
and performance content for you guys to
help you to level up so if you do enjoy
this type of video make sure you smash
that like button before you go so you
know to bring you more valuable content

[00:30]
know to bring you more valuable content
like this with that being said let's
dive into today's video in today's video
you're going to learn the optimal
grinding to studying ratio for poker
players now this is a big question to
tackle i've probably been asked this
question
at least 50 times for my coaching career

[00:47]
at least 50 times for my coaching career
players asking me i don't how much
should i grind how much should i study
what's the optimum ratio and to be
honest i've shied away from the question
i've been like oh it's very specific it
depends on your circumstances
but today i'm not going to sit on the

[01:00]
but today i'm not going to sit on the
fence i'm going to give you exact direct
numbers of how much should be grinding
how much you should be studying relative
to your situation and then we're going
to stress test it with real life
examples to see if it holds true i want
you guys in the comments to let me know
if you disagree with anything or from
your experiences you found those these

[01:16]
your experiences you found those these
ratios not to be true but we're going to
tackle it and we're going to give some
real concrete advice and actual steps
for you guys to take as a result all
right now before we dive into the juicy
stuff i want to introduce you guys to a
problem solving model called the

[01:31]
problem solving model called the
multi-arm bandit problem all right the
band is referring to a slot machine
right this is used in machine learning
and it's going to be very apparent for
what we're going to talk about today so
imagine you're a gambler in vegas and
you're stood in front of six slot

[01:47]
you're stood in front of six slot
machines all right
and each slot machine has its own
individual pl structure all right so
summer know fast and some of them up
here and i'm slow
you sit down and you start playing on
one machine as you're playing on this
machine you're getting information on

[02:01]
machine you're getting information on
this one machine and now you have the
option to keep playing on that one
machine or to stand up and try a
different machine all right since
there's one machine you're getting some
good
spins i've not really played much slots

[02:15]
spins i've not really played much slots
but you're getting some good momentum
you have the option to either exploit
the machine you're playing all right
exploit the machine you're playing or to
explore other options although this one
might be paying out at a certain rate
you don't know what you're missing all

[02:30]
you don't know what you're missing all
right so you've got the option to
exploit the current machine or explore
better options all right now your
ability to make the most money over the
long term is your is going to be
dictated by the this equation how much

[02:45]
dictated by the this equation how much
you can use your knowledge to exploit
what's in front of you and how much you
can gain new knowledge to improve your
strategy all right to jump between
machines so as a poker player
this is the exact same situation you
you're in when it comes to grinding and
studying grinding as long as you're a

[03:01]
studying grinding as long as you're a
winning player is you exploiting all
right you're exploiting the games and
you're getting paid at a certain rate
right you make that short term
profitability and you you're studying
is you're exploring you're trying to
find better strategies better ways to

[03:15]
find better strategies better ways to
play so you can come back and make more
money and over the long term
your long-term
profitability is going to be judged by
how well you do both of these all right
how well you have the ratio the ratio of
grinding to studying to exploiting to
exploring i'm going to tackle this today

[03:31]
exploring i'm going to tackle this today
and hopefully give you guys
some good ideas of how you should manage
this equation all right so
with that as a kind of framework i then
want to set another pretense and the
pretense time is going to set is as a
poker player you have one of one or two

[03:46]
poker player you have one of one or two
objectives all right and they're
generally going to correlate to the same
strategy you either want to be as good
as possible you want to become the best
player you can be so that you can play
high stakes or whatever states you you
click classes the highest for you and
you want to make as much money as

[04:01]
you want to make as much money as
possible in your career and generally
those things are going to correlate to
the same sort of approach all right
because if you become as good as
possible that gives you the opportunity
to make as much money as possible i'm
sure you guys will all agree with that
the best players are going to make the

[04:15]
the best players are going to make the
most money depending on game selection
but yeah you're going to basically try
to optimize your profitability over the
long term not the short term this
matters a lot all right if we're playing
a longer term for him it's going to make
bigger impact all right the next
pretense i'm gonna set is that your put

[04:30]
pretense i'm gonna set is that your put
korea
is gonna be
mid to long term all right so we're not
talking about how to make the most money
in a month or in a week because if we
did we'd be talking about complete
different ratios let's say your
singapore career for the for the nature
of this video or is going to be two plus

[04:45]
of this video or is going to be two plus
years all right at least two years but
two years and on and the reason i'm i'm
setting this as a pretense is if we're
thinking very short term how to make the
most money right now
it's gonna be completely different your
approach to grinding and studying is
more of a short-term model whereas if

[05:00]
more of a short-term model whereas if
we're thinking more long-term over the
course your career which i'm sure you
guys will agree do you care what you
make in a day or do you care what you
make in your career it's much more upon
your career right so if we're optimizing
for the longer term we're going to
approach it differently all right it
does it matters
quite a lot all right so with that in

[05:16]
quite a lot all right so with that in
mind i then want to set you guys some
considerations before we go into setting
the exact amount you should be grinding
and the exact amount should be studying
so some factors i've come up with
there's a this is not an exhaustive list
by any means there's definitely ones
that could be added but here are some
things to consider before you decide on

[05:31]
things to consider before you decide on
your kind of grinding to study ratio
the first thing is your ability relative
to your steak all right so if you're an
absolute crusher at your stake you've
got a high win rate some of the highest
win rates you've seen at your stake
you're going to make a lot of money by

[05:45]
you're going to make a lot of money by
grinding by grinding the high hours at
those games all right so you generally
want to increase your hours if your win
rates and skill levels really good at
that game all right these are factors
we're not going to go too exhausted on
them but we'll come back to them as we
go through next thing you want to look
at is how fast you're progressing slash

[06:01]
at is how fast you're progressing slash
moving up sticks all right if you're a
low stakes player and you're progressing
quick you're moving stakes at a very
fast rate you might want to have a
different ratio of studying to grind in
i'm going to talk about these
specifically when i go through the rules
and examples but how well how fast

[06:16]
and examples but how well how fast
you're progressing if you're someone
who's quite content with the stakes
they're at and you're not looking to
progress quickly you might want to have
a different approach which would
generally be more grinding heavy so
those progressing quicker are generally
going to have a steady heavy approach
those who are progressing slower or less

[06:31]
those who are progressing slower or less
less kind of high going to the less high
stakes might want to go for a more grind
heavy model all right next thing we'll
look at is your endurance for grinding
how many good quality hours of grinding
can you get out of yourself it's all
about a good scene i want to grind eight

[06:45]
about a good scene i want to grind eight
hours a day but if after three hours you
start losing focus and you start playing
your bcd game
we're not gonna be able to optimize
eight hours of grinding all right so
we've gotta get realistic with how much
you can actually get out of yourself you
can train that endurance over time but
this is the fact that to bear in mind
when it comes to setting these hours

[07:01]
when it comes to setting these hours
then we've got how much you can learn in
a given day slash week all right how
much can you actually learn in a day or
week now if you speak to most poker
players they would say they're studying
they're learning they're trying to
improve they're trying to get better
they're watching videos learn lots of

[07:15]
they're watching videos learn lots of
stuff all right that was interesting i
listened to a razor edge podcast with
ben cb and he said if you asked players
to write down 10 things they had learnt
and implemented into their game in the
last six months
most players would come up short

[07:32]
most players would come up short
all right so uh we've got to ask
ourselves as support players how much
are you actually learning putting into
your game and effectively improving all
right so a lot of people think they can
learn so many hours a day it's not
really true all right so most models

[07:46]
really true all right so most models
what i've seen and from like kind of
high performers you can get one
to three
high quality deep focused hours of
studying in per day all right this is
almost any topic all right there's a
great book called deep work by cal
newport who thinks the best performers

[08:01]
newport who thinks the best performers
can get up to three hours of high
quality really high quality learning
whereas most people one is a good
benchmark all right so we're going to
come back to this because it's going to
set a pretense when we go into the
numbers but we get at least one and
three is kind of the upper boundary all

[08:16]
three is kind of the upper boundary all
right we can push it on from there
especially if we look at different study
methods but in terms of intense learning
that's that's in the framework we're
going to be using and the final
consideration is what are the
opportunity costs of not grinding all
right will the opportunity cost when i
study over grinding all right i could

[08:32]
study over grinding all right i could
have done another 20 but those are the
first ones that came to mind and the
most some of the most important ones
when we're considering are grinding to
uh studying ratios all right now i'm
going to do some breath and i'm going to
come up with a rules instead of rules to

[08:47]
come up with a rules instead of rules to
follow it's going to be two rules and
then we're going to explore if these
rules stand up in different situations
all right so when it comes to setting
your optimal grinding to study ratio
there's two rules i want you guys to
follow

[09:00]
follow
all right rule number one
is you should grind more than you study
all right you could grind more new study
so at least fifty percent of your
designated hours to poker should be
grinding and you might say adam why is
this all right and the reason is when

[09:17]
this all right and the reason is when
you get above that 50 markers stood
again there's a tip and point where you
can't implement what you're learning all
right so as you guys know as poker
players there's an element of learning
new stuff but it's not no good just
gaining knowledge gain knowledge gain

[09:30]
gaining knowledge gain knowledge gain
knowledge get knowledge you've got to
actually use that knowledge in-game and
implement it and i've literally i've
worked with hundreds of board players
like multiple hundreds of poker players
i probably spoke with maybe five to 600
players at least um in their careers and
i haven't came across a player a very

[09:45]
i haven't came across a player a very
successful player i was crushing their
games who studies
more than the ground all right and the
reason being is it just becomes really
hard to implement it really comes really
hard to implement your learning you get
to a point where you're almost more
confused because the knowledge coming in
you can't filter it into your game all

[10:01]
you can't filter it into your game all
right so
this is the rule number one is we've got
to grind
sorry yeah grind more and we study as a
pretense all right so uh anyone who's
thinking all right i'm just gonna grind
like say some upcoming players and i'm
just gonna i'm just gonna study eight
hours a day here it's okay but is that

[10:16]
hours a day here it's okay but is that
effective all right so the first rule
i'm gonna stress test this or
bear with me because we're gonna go
through examples of mistakes low stakes
high stakes players and see how this
would look and see if we can actually
break these rules in practice
that's the first rule the second rule is
you should aim to study at least 10

[10:31]
you should aim to study at least 10
percent of your total polka hours all
right at least 10 percent all right you
might go well i don't know where you're
plucking these random numbers from all
right so the reason being is because as
i said before
most people can get one high quality

[10:46]
most people can get one high quality
hour of study of deep focus of deep
learning out of themselves in a given
day all right that's like not a high not
low it's like most players should aim
for one high quality hour all right
so if you can get one high quality alba

[11:00]
so if you can get one high quality alba
that high quality alba is going to be
great roi by that i mean it's going to
improve your game over the long term
it's going to allow you to have good
earning potential over the long term so
if you've got you're the guy got the one
quality hour every single day you're
going to progress and your knowledge and
skill level is going to improve at a

[11:15]
skill level is going to improve at a
good rate a good rate which is going to
give you more inner potential so
multiplayer should be aiming to get that
one hour now if you're a grinding
machine and you're going like crazy even
then you can still get that hour all
right so say you're you put 10 hours
into pocket every day
you could grind nine of those hours

[11:32]
you could grind nine of those hours
in one hour of study all right so even
on the top threshold of grinding you get
nine hours of grinding you get one hour
study all right so we want to aim for
this i'm going to go through some models
and some examples to see if this all was
true all right so two simple rules

[11:46]
true all right so two simple rules
for you guys to bear in mind at least
half your hours should be grinding and
at least 10
of your hours should be studying so what
we've got here we've got
50 50 is the kind of the most extreme
outlaw yeah then we've got your grind

[12:00]
outlaw yeah then we've got your grind
numbers this one can go all the way up
to 90 but not above 90 in general all
right again we'll talk about examples of
where you might want to break that but
germany between 50 and 90. you're
studying on the other side it's between
50 and not more than 10. all right as

[12:15]
50 and not more than 10. all right as
high as 50 not as low as 10. all right
so these are bandwidths to work in all
right so we can toggle them up and down
but we can't go too far those ranges all
right so now we're gonna go for examples
of how this could look and also what
different players different stakes might
want to use as their approaches and why

[12:32]
want to use as their approaches and why
they might want to choose more studying
or more grinding based on their
situation all right so first of all
we're going to look at a low stakes
player all right so he's been playing it
six months to a year doesn't matter how
long and he's putting 20 hours into
poker so the first thing before we do

[12:46]
poker so the first thing before we do
anything else split our was decide how
many hours you were putting into poker
in a given week all right in a given
week all right so let's say this player
is putting 20 hours into poker in a
given week because it's almost like
having a pie you've got to cut the pie
between studying and grinding we've got

[13:01]
between studying and grinding we've got
to decide in advance how big the pie is
all right it's not infinite all right
it's gonna be in that bandwidth all
right so this player is doing 20 hours
of poker per week so first of all
some of the as a low stakes player
the opportunity costs of not playing are

[13:17]
the opportunity costs of not playing are
lower right compared to high stakes guy
if you're you're lowest x guy
not playing the opportunity costs aren't
that big all right just your hourly is
lower all right you also have the most
to learn so the roi you're studying is a
lot bigger if you look at learner models

[13:30]
lot bigger if you look at learner models
there's almost this like very steep
learning curve at the start we have a
massive gain and then you have something
called the law of diminished returns as
you study more and it almost like evens
off in this very um depressing way if
you're a high stakes guy you you towards
the tail end of this flat almost like
flat curve with your learning but it's a

[13:46]
flat curve with your learning but it's a
low stakes guy but so much lame all
right so you've got to this opportunity
to uh improve your game a lot by
studying but also you need to play you
need to put reps in it's like in the gym
and you put reps in to actually get good
at the game so we can't just gonna study

[14:00]
at the game so we can't just gonna study
for 20 hours we need to actually put
reps into playing all right so we've got
opportunity costs of learning and sorry
playing on on that big and we've got a
great opportunity to learn but we also
need to get reps in for
our kind of grinding so how would you

[14:15]
our kind of grinding so how would you
approach it as this player i would say
we should really approach it with in
terms of trying to get that one hour of
high quality study a day all right so
that says players playing five days you
spend five days in the poker i say go
for five hours one hour a day of

[14:30]
for five hours one hour a day of
studying all right so i've given five
hours of studying that would give him 15
hours of grinding and his ratio of
grinding to study in would be 75 percent
grinding 25 percent studying all right
so you'd fall nicely in the model the
lowest this guy could go would be to two

[14:46]
lowest this guy could go would be to two
hours if you did two hours of studying i
needed 18 hours of grinding that'll put
him right at the bottom in terms of his
is kind of 10
to 90
ratios all right so that's a kind of
good framework if he went over 50 let's

[15:00]
good framework if he went over 50 let's
say he was doing 10 hours plus i said
that would be too much all right he's
pushed it too much this lowest this guy
needs to get reps in of playing poker
now she's using what he's learning all
right so somewhere in that one hour like
a 25 to the end would be a good model
for this player now let's have a look at

[15:15]
for this player now let's have a look at
a mid-sticks player and let's say he's
put in 30 hours a week into poker all
right so now this player has
more opportunity costs and he doesn't
play the cost of great of studying is
going to
hurt a bit more because he could be
grinding having a good hourly uh but at

[15:30]
grinding having a good hourly uh but at
the same time he's still got a lot of
progression to make all right he's still
trying to improve his game both his win
rate of the level he's playing and he
has the opportunity to progress from mid
stakes to high sticks all right so this
player needs to have a learning curve if
he wants to maximize his potential to
earn money in his book career he needs

[15:45]
earn money in his book career he needs
to have a good study habit so again this
player might want to start out with one
hour a day all right let's say this guy
plays
six days a week all right so you do six
hours of
studying and then you do 24 hours of
grinding all right so six hours of

[16:00]
grinding all right so six hours of
studying 24 hours of grinding this would
leave him with a ratio of 80 grinding to
study it all right so still in that that
framework that we've set let's say this
guy is a bit of a he loves learning and
he's really good at studying and he
enjoys it let's say increases his

[16:16]
enjoys it let's say increases his
threshold because you want one hour idea
that's nothing for me adam i only two
hours a day awesome let's test that so
two hours a day would be 12 hours of
studying in a week all right there's a
high quality of us this is not passive
watching twitch you're watching youtube

[16:30]
watching twitch you're watching youtube
even watching like run it once or
passive training videos this is full
immersion this is not taking this is
complete distraction free really
engaging your mind and learning the high
level all right this is not
watching passive content all right so i
say this play i did two hours a day

[16:46]
say this play i did two hours a day
that'd be 12 hours in a week of grinding
i started studying and 18 hours of
grinding and the ratio would be 60
grinding to 40 studying again very much
within the framework which i'm setting
all right
let's say this guy wanted to go

[17:00]
let's say this guy wanted to go
for three hours a day because i know i
want to do more studying than him three
hours a day now he's broken this model
that i've come with all right and now
he's he'll be grinding 18 sorry studying
18 hours and he'd be grinding only 12.
now his ratio of grinding to study in

[17:16]
now his ratio of grinding to study in
would be 40 grinding 60 studying all
right so this player i would say he
needs to grind more so increase his
taught levels to so it's at least 50 50
or study a bit less put some of those
hours in to grind him all right could it
work potentially i haven't seen it work

[17:31]
work potentially i haven't seen it work
in practice but you generally because
you want you need those plain hours it's
so hard it's like if someone gets strong
in the gym it's like okay you can take
all the supplements you want you can eat
all the food you want but you need to
get the gym and certainly the time to
lift it's the same with pocket you need
to put those reps in you need to
actually use that knowledge and as soon

[17:46]
actually use that knowledge and as soon
as you tip that threshold too far
you just can't
you don't you're not able to implement
you're learning in a quicker way like
there's more knowledge going in but
there's no implementation there's no
deep knowledge that you're actually
being able to use into your game or
there's too much knowledge you become
overwhelmed all right so that player

[18:01]
overwhelmed all right so that player
again would have two advice would be his
kind of limit for
studying
all right then let's go
to
a high stakes player all right so a high
stakes player let's say he's playing 50
hours a week all right generally the
highest six players are gonna play the
most there's a reason they're the high
sticks guys and let's say this guy has

[18:17]
sticks guys and let's say this guy has
massive opportunity cost by not playing
his hourly is really high he's in super
juicy games and he wants to uh maximize
his ability and let's say he's playing
five days a week and he spent 10 hours
into grind and just into pocket all

[18:30]
into grind and just into pocket all
right now this player has more of a
trade-off to make and we could argue
okay in the short term
he's best of grinding all right because
he's able he's for the roof but if this
guy's plan on playing poker for that two
plus yes two plus he has a poker he's
going to want to make sure that players

[18:45]
going to want to make sure that players
don't overtake him he wants to make sure
they keep in with the curve that he's
improving his game so he can continue to
maximize his ability all right so this
player just maximizes his grinding
doesn't study at all there's gonna be
limit amount of time for other players
overtaking all right so with that in

[19:00]
overtaking all right so with that in
mind this play again might want to go
right i want to have that one high
quality hour one high quality hour idea
of studying so make over five hours a
calendar in a week of studying one hour
idea five days and then 45 hours of
grinding all right because i was really

[19:15]
grinding all right because i was really
high so this player would fall into the
category but 90 grinding and 10 percent
studying he's maximizing his hourly so
he's exploiting exploits by exploits but
he's still exploring he's still getting
better he's still improving if he tipped
that too far might say 1999 grind in and
kept that studying law

[19:30]
kept that studying law
he's playing a risky game all right
because how long before someone else
other players will take him and his
hourly drops especially the high-stakes
games when the fields are a lot smaller
all right so because we're trying to
play this kind of multibanding game we
need to exploit by playing but we also
need to explore how to get better and as

[19:47]
need to explore how to get better and as
soon as we stop exploring and just
exploit exploits we're getting overtaken
all right and we're gonna we're not
gonna get the optimal strategy and we're
not gonna make the most money over the
course of our poker careers so hopefully
this has been of interest to you guys
and i would like to know your thoughts

[20:01]
and i would like to know your thoughts
in the comments so let me know what your
current ratio is let me know in the
rational terms how much you grind
compared to how much you study as a
ratio i'd love to know if any of you
guys are not within the boundaries i've
set and if you're not let me know why
and let me know if you think it works

[20:15]
and let me know if you think it works
for you obviously everyone's individual
and there's different things that we
have different people would hope this is
giving you guys a good framework all
right so uh to give you the rules and to
simplify it and summarize everything aim
to grind more than you study aim to
study at least ten percent of your

[20:30]
study at least ten percent of your
grinding hours and aim to grind into
study sorry at least one high quality
hour at least one high quality hour per
pocket day all right if you can stick to
those three rules you've got an amazing
system all right that's generally going
