[00:01]

seven losing the small blend let's just
hope everyone faults
and then we're gonna pump it up
let's go guys pump it up bump it up

[00:45]
let's go guys pump it up bump it up
[Music]
check come on my friend
i think our hands was a little bit too
weak to

[01:00]
weak to
to bet again
actually in hindsight maybe actually i
should have just bet again
i thought it was maybe a bit too weak
ace deuce or something fine
a three a four five sixes i think seven
deuce is not just a check fold on the

[01:16]
deuce is not just a check fold on the
turn
sad face we flop trips pips is usually
not a bad hand
this is mr nabzu let's see if he's going
to do something finnish
yeah he's going to do something finnish
guys

[01:31]
guys
he's going to do something finnish
love it actually i think this is a very
good play
shout out to miss and upstoop
that's going to be we're going to be put

[01:46]
that's going to be we're going to be put
in quite a tough position
okay it's an interesting river if we
were beat guys
we got saved by the bell what should he
do
that's why i guess there is no point in
raising i mean
he's gonna call us with an eight uh

[02:02]
he's gonna call us with an eight uh
with aces and with eights though
oh god we got saved by the we got saved
by that river guys oh my god
elgin would have lost a stack trips over
trips
in the one of the first biggest big

[02:16]
in the one of the first biggest big
hands on stream but hey why worry about
that when you get aces
16 bb for the grab the grass
mr straubman that's good luck thank you

[02:30]
mr straubman that's good luck thank you
very much
okay got two collars
actually maybe we should have used a
different sizing here i think actually
in hindsight an over bed would have been
good here

[02:47]
yeah i should have just over bet the
turn that would have been better
here we make something very beautiful as

[03:02]
well
actually i think i had a similar spot
that i wanted to look up exactly
i think i'm just gonna give up oh step

[03:18]
i think i'm just gonna give up oh step
on the shoulder guys step on the
shoulder goddamit

[03:35]
[Music]
throws a little over bet why not
why not why not
like a seven on the turn eight

[03:47]
like a seven on the turn eight
also an interesting card
definitely i think also a card that i
accept i accept

[04:00]
accept i accept
yes we have the best hand sometime but
yeah then i check
that's the river not
not not not like a spot that i'm very
excited about
for you jared the best player in the
pool no but there is this thing going on

[04:16]
pool no but there is this thing going on
allegedly everyone says he is the best
five in the nozzle player
a very good player for sure
guys we have pocket four so you know
what my what my policy is right when we
have a pair
you fall pre-flop with a pair you cannot
flop a set guys

[04:31]
flop a set guys
and now he's going to squeeze it now i
have to
i have to confirm this again uh-oh
but maybe maybe with a little bit of
luck

[04:47]
charlie carroll
you can make it all right guys
let's pop a set i am lucky i am skillful
and i will win you gotta feel it

[05:01]
and i will win you gotta feel it
guys no it's not it's a king i've loved
but i see a runner running straight
flush for us
he throws a little 11 percent i like it
ben i'm a fan i'm a phantom fan

[05:19]
interesting turn ah this turn really
sucks
he bets again okay so he probably

[05:35]
he bets again okay so he probably
is and is my hand life

[06:04]
hello

[06:16]
the positions are quite tight like it's
very hard for me to show up with a bluff
here
i usually just have a suited hand
or a set

[06:34]
or a set
you guys like ace jack suited a sense
suited river the ace queen
that's what it's looking like that's
what it's looking like
oh god exciting times guys exciting

[06:46]
oh god exciting times guys exciting
times god damn it
why do you always make us sweat oh i
cannot look guys
cannot look oh he falls
thank you sir see we've been a little
bit slow on the cliffs huh
i know there's actually also last stream

[07:02]
i know there's actually also last stream
let's see if we have uh oh we we gotta
set that
set check that's my philosophy lopsets

[07:17]
set check that's my philosophy lopsets
i think it's always with this kind of
situation it's very hard to make money
huh
come on nine ten suited you made
nine tenth suited big bat

[07:30]
nine tenth suited big bat
big race oh
did he indeed make it actually he can
still have his d nuts
that's how you do it guys you see

[07:48]
that's how you do it guys you see
you wait until the guy makes two pair
and then with 280 bucks
it looks so simple however you have top
upset aces
i like five four students i'm in i'm in

[08:07]
bingo is afraid now he's afraid like oh
my god
oh my god did he really nines
really really

[08:18]
less hand seven seven four four
my friend

[08:31]
oh vanquish is also everyone is
interested in the spot that bingo
bingo has a tough spot now

[08:55]
i know you are not capable of following
the 8i flush draw

[09:12]
but now this guy is throwing out a big

[09:15]
but now this guy is throwing out a big
bed
hey
not very happy about this one
i didn't view it with the five four i
didn't do it

[09:30]
didn't do it
didn't feel it with the five what are
you guys
did i have called when it when it's your
money yeah
when it's your uh i think you bet like
280 bucks
what is your turn would you have called
with your 280 bucks that's the question

[09:46]
with your 280 bucks that's the question
let me know in the chat or in the
comments down below
i chickened out guys i'm a little bit
ashamed after just making that whole
statement like oh guys you know i called
this so you guys don't have to worry now

[10:01]
this so you guys don't have to worry now
everyone is like
what it's us that was exactly what we
were trying to prevent
i just didn't have a good feeling about
it

[10:17]
okay it's a lot of nice let's go
good hand big bet my philosophy

[10:30]
okay he raises interesting
that's a good turn very good turn

[10:47]
that's a good turn very good turn
that's a very very good turn really like
it's almost almost like almost like
making a set

[11:02]
but then
here the cherub man the german wants to
wants to play around

[11:15]
wants to play around
okay okay okay okay oh we got the queens
so we ain't going anywhere
we are a little bit deeper though but
they're not to do anything else than
the m with queens i think

[11:33]
yes jax one less than me and we both
make sets
but luckily for me i have the highest
one

[11:54]
okay both guys calls when two fun
players call on a board like this you're
quite happy when you have king queen

[12:02]
continue some money in the pot then
race
i'm so unhappy about this situation

[12:16]
ah it was a little bit shallower like 30
bb
snap call 40bp snip call
a screen definitely calling

[12:30]
a screen definitely calling
it's not a single draw on the board
just the problem is like if he has a set
i'm dead huh
so we don't really have a lot of equity
versus
that brains but then again if it just
shows over a random hand

[12:45]
shows over a random hand
then we do quite well
i think he's just a little bit too deep
to call
ace queen the guy can turn over a screen
now that's what i'm flopping about

[13:01]
now that's what i'm flopping about
see
i am interested my friend gigi from uh
bulgaria
throwing some hungarian money here give
me some bulgarian
honey thanks be kind you know what

[13:20]
honey thanks be kind you know what
i'm just if he pots the flop checks a
turn
not even worse five fifty now zoom is

[13:31]
not even worse five fifty now zoom is
harder than two five live okay
shout out to the two five live grinders

[14:00]
oh
guys we flopped the nace we flopped an
ace
okay he makes a
[Music]
next small bed again extra thing is

[14:17]
next small bed again extra thing is
quite good
actually is this the point that we just
ship our money in
this exact hand probably right

[14:34]
seven was good enough for it
it was a recreational i'm okay checking
normally i would just bat

[14:52]
on a turn actually i'm gonna go for a
bed now on the turn
when the jack rolls off

[15:03]
but yeah if i would have check raised
the smaller size in there with the jack
seven i think
batting turn is fine and then

[15:24]
and then just betting river again in a
normal in a normal
check raised line that term but yeah my

[15:30]
check raised line that term but yeah my
stack would have probably gone in and
then actually we would have actually
lost a stack
okay bingo
we got bingo this crazy guy

[15:56]
he's gonna call any any hand with a
spade basically maybe even
just two random overs

[16:06]
don't wanna bet so don't want a bad call
wait wow how

[16:18]
i don't even know what the call is were
we lucky unlucky yeah i don't know
like lego check right here and on the
other table i'm gonna go for it delayed

[16:30]
other table i'm gonna go for it delayed

quiet because the tables have been a bit
