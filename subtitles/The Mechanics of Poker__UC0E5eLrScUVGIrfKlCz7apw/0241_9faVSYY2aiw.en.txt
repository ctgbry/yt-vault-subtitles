There seems to be a gap in the awareness
of the low performer where if you were
to ask them, hey, what did you do today?
Their story around what they did would
be significantly different than an
objective account of their process. It's
that discrepancy. I think that's another
thing that distinguishes the high
performer from the low performer. The
low performer has an obsession with
making it sound like they did more than
they did that
day to the point where it almost
inadvertently gas lit us as coaches
because, you know, we couldn't figure it
out. The guy is saying he's doing
everything he needs to do and his
schedule is dialed. And then we take a
deeper look and he's eating pizza for
breakfast and he's staying up till 4:00
a.m. at the bars. It just didn't track.
