welcome back to another play and explain
HL Zoom this time jumping straight into
the action we have D9 here and on this
board I decided to check I think it's
high enough that we can start having a
cabat range but I like to check the A9
and put it in the check race and we
opened here pocket Jacks got a call I
think checking here is by far the best
option now as play I think we have to
start getting some value out other hand
I think his range is going to contain a
lot of worse paars and a nine so trying
to get value think is way better than
going for a bluff catch line you know
snap raises the river also on the bigger
side this a bit weird though I think I'm
actually going to
jam and here with the Jacks I think we
have easy call
twice and had this guy Bluff with 910 so
the as is pretty pretty interesting I
feel like we probably block the best
hand he can have in King n 108 he never
has anymore we can definitely have 108
Queen 10 I think it's very unlikely I
think most players just stab Queen 10 in
the turn so I think this is just is
going to work well exploitatively yes we
did not block we did not block a queen
or a 10 but hey uh I think it's is one
of these spots where we just have such a
big Advantage feel like it's a spot
where people could for example fold
their range at at lower stakes and the
Jacks it was three-way I believe I think
check raising is there is by far the
better option there if you're going to
see bet a hand it's probably Jacks like
the higher pair the more you want to go
for the check
race then facing a stab we could start
raising but uh I wasn't really sure who
the small blind was so yeah I think
calling is is also fine but three-way
like if it was heads up I would always
just call but three-way you know you're
a bit more incentivized so maybe raise a
turn to deny Equity from the guy behind
you bucket KN I was going to say is
actually a hand that's probably going to
get over called uh by majority of
population here versus three bet but I'm
kind of getting sucked in here H5 suited
I think it's probably one of my first
candidates to start for B
bluffing so that's what I'll do here is
a pot from this probably a recreational
player uh I'm going to start off with a
c here
and get a fold
there this
hand can either check I think check
raising is nicer if you have higher
cards so then basically your check also
has like some Showdown value so I'll go
for the BET here with A3 so let's see if
ACE check with a of clubs there I think
going for a check race is pretty good
here with Ace 5
I think I'm going to at least double
barrel this hand and then go from
there King High Bo are just very good
for
the for the
imposition player they're going to have
trouble
defending on they I'm actually just
going to fold straight away here on the
turn I think he's letting off us to hook
here
here FES without Spade I think I'm just
going to check fold straight
away sevens I would call regardless of
my suits but I feel like when we get
lower fives probably needs some extra
Equity yes you know recreationals
overstep but they also overstep like too
much top pairs stuff like
that I think this a guy Recreation
player called called called us here as
well here at Aces I think I'm just going
to check
call it's a good
turn now reverse H poot I think raising
here is now pretty
important because I feel like this this
is very much in line with a 10 and I
feel like he's going to check back the
river a lot so I feel like now trying to
extract value it's probably a bit bit
better without any information and then
you could say well but now you make him
fold all your Bluffs your value with
aces in my opinion in that spot should
not come from letting him Bluff you your
value should come from trying to stack a
10 let's say you do have a 10 then a 10
makes money out of letting him Bluff
catch
okay a 10 does not have much EV in
raising so therefore Bluff catching is
an easy alternative he would have to
overbluff significantly for us to be
check calling Aces there again simply
because how much value we lose from for
example a 10 or maybe you know he gets
sticky with pocket a or something you
know I've seen crazier
stuff pocket kings definitely for
betting gem all right will take
it he has Aces
diamonds I he hit it one eight so we can
hit a king I'm sure
not that sure not really sure who this
guy is if this is a quote quote
professional short short stacker I think
for flinger is fine but I think it's way
more likely that he's just a
recreational
player uh I'm going to check this
back and here with the King three I'll
start with a
stab I'll check this one back as
well I think the nine is a good card to
Barrel on
one here I think bluffing is fine with
my
hand try make him full hand like pocket
fors same hand decided to go for the
three qu there with the King three I'm
going to actually go for a call here I
see three recreational players then I
think cold calling is going to
outperform three betting because the
three if have three betting NES here is
are quite low we get squeezed definitely
going
to call and see what
develops very bad board for us so we're
just going to check
fault pots again I think he poted
earlier as well when we had n yeah with
the King three I think you can have two
sizings there on the turn thinking three
plays nicely in this sizing if you want
to have one sizing pot or something
could be
good easy go to Jack eight and probably
folding turn on improved bit of a weird
sizing actually going to PE one more for
this sizing see what develops my
out kind of go both ways on one side I
have more Equity versus a lot of his uh
draws bucket 3es in tile formation I
like calling pocket 3es when it gets
white I prefer hands like six and sevens
now feel like we do have to raise I'm
probably going to f for
reras yeah
Queen it's Queen
10 actually if you have a hand here like
pocket n or something you probably want
to actually be checking this is actually
a board
that explo ofely you could also just
range B actually I like checking this
hand I don't mind
it so that's what we're going to
do he checks again I'll go for a delay C
bat here Queen We Three it EAS see on
this
board face a raise which is a bit
weird she going to come over the
top and here the queen
10 got a fult
and here we also get a f I think I could
just size quite big there with the queen
10 given the way people construct their
ranges I feel like the check call there
is usually a bit weaker than in theory
so therefore I'm it's allowing me to go
bigger than Theory just think like hand
like pocket
a it's going to be a a bigger proportion
of his range
G to just check F this if I had any any
of the other suits I would definitely
either check graay or check call 9 check
check I think just checking is the best
option the seven could have definitely
hit him definitely don't want to get
raised etc
etc goes for this half poy bat
interesting maybe eights or nines it's
bit more unlikely since I have a
nine or it was just complete bananas
he beted ace high it's a weird bet don't
really see any reason to bet he had A4
of Hearts don't really see any reason to
bet you just want to probably just check
it down check it down and try to win for
his my king queen H the king queen Su
decid to go for call for but bit on the
loser side but that's for sure here at
the ace10 with the Spade I probably
still
call Queen 10
if he was the hijack this would have
been a very great card cuz I have Queen
10 off and he doesn't but now we it's
divided so probably going to call again
we can do something on Spades but first
an overb probably Force to fold can we
call lead
spade out of the box do we sometimes are
we sometimes no I think we just have
theault like this is also a turn on
which he has to be a little bit careful
and I feel like people bet a bit too
often with one street hands so they go
Pat check too often on a board like that
instead of check bat which they should
do with more hands like Ace King for
example so therefore I feel like we
should probably not [ __ ] too much with
the betting
range poock
shut probably Recreation player I know
was not full stacked and I have not seen
him
four here
turn we have the king of spade which is
a bit annoying in terms
of how often he's going to Bluff I feel
like if people do start bluffing here
it's 54 pocket Force so hence with extra
Equity he does use a little bit of a
weaker sizing so I'm going to call at
least one and reevaluate Fair B River 67
out got there 54 improved Four's
improved so I feel like we're just going
to be forced to fold 689 pretty good
board for the big blind here so I'm
going to jam and now I think we're just
forced to
fold here I'm actually going
to check again I
think and call
riverse would have definitely raised if
the river was not a for straight and
maybe actually first that sizing could
have I think actually I called too fast
should have probably raced for that
sizing but hey let's just move to the
next hand and get Del Asis that's that's
you know it's a good way to do it here
kind of depends
on how nit your opponent is if your Val
should just come from stacking him
straight away or uh just calling let
letting him do something
funky all low so I decided to go for a
call that's more from my own strategy
perspective I would probably 50/50 if I
would slow play or fast play this
hand from Peri strategy perspective but
obviously just try to look for
Tendencies of your opponent or of the
pool to either always fast always slow
play for example I think it's fine if
the guy just a nit just always fast play
and try to stack him and I would just
call down hope he's blasting here with
something like king queen suited or
something
great run out or could we have just got
it in Pre flop and he just say Kings
it's OB also an
option we've just been playing all this
hands it's also a pretty bad River frame
56 67
ace5 pocket for should probably Bluff
sometimes here on the turn check
check definitely checking the river
probably going to go for a check call
here some of the time I think that's
that's fine
people are not going to be fating too 10
in my experience we block H4 we unblock
all the Bluffs x 78 and stuff so I would
have probably checked called there and
if we're over calling that with Force
for example he should start value Bing
maybe as thin as the hand that he has so
just don't really think that's an
exploit that's happening a lot here
where's Lee United from Ireland we made
a 24 which actually on the bigger side
for this spot therefore I think jamming
actually is also a fine option folding
is also fine option there's just a lot
of fine options go for the
call on a queen High board so my
motto on in a lot of these spots is just
to do a lot of raising so I think I'm
just going to go straight away check
raise this and here I'm going to go for
an overb with the
95 turn is close we have no diamonds so
I think then jamming is fine I think if
we have a diamond I don't mind checking
a queen
sometimes definely going to jam here I
hand like
eight I think that's a fine gem as
well just pocket
Jacks
968 again not probably not going to be
the
highest yeah actually but snap got there
with Jack I think it's pretty loose to
be
honest it's pretty
loose we can EP we can just
bet 1/3 I think that's
fine usually when the boards get a
little bit lower half B is preferred but
two tone we have T I think those
circumstances lead to one3 also being
fine so I'm happy I didn't have pocket
eights since he SN go with Jacks
probably fault like tense is already
better and he just has yeah you
know Kings Aces Ace queen king
queen just in general when you call in
that spot and the board is Queen high or
higher so the board contains a queen a
king or an ace yeah you're just a little
bit [ __ ] because you will have more
hands like bucket sevens pocket eights
pocket NES and he will just have all the
Broadways so then what you usually want
to do is you want to you don't want to
playb a lot you're going to do over
folding compared to MDF so in terms of
how often he bats how often that has to
work and how often you have to defend in
order to discourage him from betting any
two but when he has accurity Advantage
yeah there's just not much you can do
and trying to fight back in those spots
is just going to lose you a lot of money
then what you can do is you can just be
very selective and mainly do mainly play
raises here check check check
check guy betting one3 in position don't
really see a lot of Bluffs to be honest
usually they don't really value bet to
Tin here and if he has a king he could
bet bigger and you know there's a random
fact so and we get great odds so let's
see it there the king that's fine I also
like King Jack King 10 definitely has
that he could sometimes stab with on the
Flop stab with on the turn so feel like
there's just enough reason to toss in
the two big blinds and give the guy a
free coffee or two depending on where
you
live first recreational I'm G to do
something exploitative here with Ace
King I think I'm going to mainly size up
size my
Bluffs small and my value big because I
think it's just a very inelastic
board meaning that when he has Ace he's
going to call any amount when he has
Queen Jack King 10 stuff like that it's
going to call any amount now he will
have a bit more offsuit hands in his
range than for example normal call range
so actually what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to fire again for a smaller
sizing
I think checking after having bet as big
as I have don't think is great let's say
I would have bet small on the Flop and
his range is wider I think checking and
letting him blow something on the river
is fine but I think when we go Direction
Let's extract most out of his value
range uh I think them betting turn is
fine sizing wise I think one3 is good
like we're trying to uh if we go to big
there at some point we will be isolating
ourselves only versus higher Equity
Holdings I want to put him in a tough
spot to hand like like 10 jack off suit
or like just a suit at a and I feel like
if we go to big those hands are just
going to fold and then what's left is
some point what at some point what's if
you go in at some point what's left
there's only flushes but somewhere you
know along the along the bed sizing tree
there is an optimal sizing where we
still get enough value and we try to put
him in a tough spot and I feel like that
was that was it right there let squeeze
here with the queen
Jack probably going actually one big
bigger but is fine get a
call it's going to be very very very
tight range but we're playing H Zuma I
don't know who the who these guys are so
you know there's always a random factor
involved I'm going to start with check
which I which I will do probably with my
entire range if both guy calls both guys
call because I have a lot off suit hands
and those make up for quite a lot of
Combos and there more Su have I'm
probably just going to check race
okay and there he was with the very
tight cool car range showing that ja
suited Chop
Chop see here D King check check I'm
going to call the river I don't know guy
is but there's a chance he could be
recreational
defend 43 off suit I mean could actually
be
a fine defense but let's re here with
the 910 could also call think both
options are fine when he for bats he
does snap forbat that concerns me a
little bit the sizing is on the Lower
Side 910 suited I'm going to lean
towards a fold if I had better let's say
king queen suited obviously I call if I
have wor like 56 suited 6 seven suited
feel like we have to call as well but
not too happy with n and suited
particularly and with the snap forbat I
wanted to actually three here with d H4
I think I'm still going to do it
but this guy just called my squeeze with
10j suited so most likely we have way
less fault equity and therefore you
should probably just remove your three B
Bluffs so yeah don't don't try this at
home I actually check race straight away
with the queen Jack actually also
wouldn't mind check
calling cuz I feel like then if the turn
is an ace or a king we can just take it
away on the next street and if we had a
queen or queen or Jack it's pretty good
for us I think both options are fine
like there's definitely some things you
can do if you check call but I feel like
this is the lazy
option to King seven TR three to King 10
going to go for a
call King seven I think it's clear check
back on a 10 and re-evaluate the r River
probably calling he checks on this Jack
Jack n
board probably just going to check as
well and see what happens that's usually
my My Philosophy run out here doesn't
get any better 48 34 and I also made a
straight he checks again I think now we
probably have license to to bet I think
somewhere down between half pot and 1/3
so course this sizing obviously have a
snap call can have the same hand or he
can be
bluffing he's jackar with the
98 decent
turn this likely going to overb and
we're just going to have to fult think
here oh I think ex checking is going to
be a bit better with specifically 98
blocking the nines and the eights to be
hands that he would check back or like
like 97 or 78 I think if he has a 10
he's just going to Val B himself so we
mainly lose value out of maybe like a
five or pocket force or
something he had ace high we could give
him a chance of bluff I think checking
there is by far better with 98 than
basically all the other options and then
the plan is when he BS that we're just
going to rip our whole stack in five for
suited my favorite hand never lets me
down flop a
Paar probably going to go at least one
bet but wouldn't hate to see myself go B
betat if we
improve face a pretty big check
race uh it's probably already CL I'm
going to call and kind of see what
develops we have position so what's kind
of the worst that can happen well you
can make two and any other guy has a
better hand no that's that's fair that's
fair uh but you're not calling pure on
based on the strength of your hand
you're calling because you have position
you know you could maneuver some turns
and
rivers uh this is already bit dicey but
I feel like we have to call feel like
our hand is not great good enough to rip
so I'm going to call and reevaluate the
river problem is a lot of his Bluffs
here should probably come from having a
five but I don't think he's going to
Bluff with two bu of draws one two three
four five
six seven
H what's his value one two three four
five six
seven you know checks going to rip it
him he could have Ace King I think
sometimes he could have but I just don't
think people check enough strong hands
here so then we're just going
to two draws missing and I could maybe
turn like five six suited or something
into a
bluff versus a river for
10 10 ex Spates that would have probably
been
done but yeah you're not necessarily
calling because you know you have such a
great hand but you're just calling
because you have position and you know
being in position is just very powerful
here queen I'm going to lean towards
check and probably bet the river
Queen's just ripping I think it's the
best
play jacks are tense I think calling is
also fine or if you have Aces but I feel
like kings and queens are just the hands
that you mainly want to
rip T and Jacks you know they are
already a little bit they already make a
little bit less money ripping so then
the alternative of calling becomes
interesting and Aces uh as just the the
Bluffs just have so little little Equity
fors Aces that that's fine as well
here with d A10 forb
bet very bad board similar to the forb
pot we played earlier that was a c for
poto with the a Queen this is just a
board where you're going to have to
massively over fold for example if you
have Ace queen of harder you know just
folding or let's say you have pocket NS
just folding straightaways it's
mandatory here versus m r Queen 10
actually I think it's already a bit
close you usually want to expand with
like connectors like five six off for
example would have already been way
better here one3 delay I'm going to PE
one just get a great
price
re-evaluate I think I'm just going to
fold here he check back so
quick that I feel like and then this
line I feel like it's quite in line with
an ace and I feel like if you had
Complete Air you might there's on
average people then also go for for
example check check bed line so not
really too concerned to be exploited
here here facing 13 one3 I am a bit
concerned that this
is uh like a weak valure
hand like king queen or something but we
just get a good price and you know
sometimes it's not and sometimes it's
just 68 suited so there for you call
here we get three from what I think is a
recreational player on the smaller
side see see what flop
Rings snap check and he probably doesn't
have ER if he snap
checks imagine ER kind of thinks about
it and then I think on the turn if he
has queens or jacks or something with a
diamond he's probably
calling same if he did check back Ace
King or if he Ace Kings or let's say he
did check back Ace queen or Ace Jack
feel like he's almost always calling
turn so I think just betting big there
with your flush is probably the best
option and I feel like checking again
there towards recreationals they just
don't value betting enough they try to
take an ace to
Showdown uh so I think quote quote
trapping there is a very bad play
there's a fine spot to stab here with
the
jacku feel like we can Bluff quite a l
rivers three five 8 9 10 we could hit a
jack that would be amazing and just I
think on average at 100 l no offense uh
people are just going to be a bit more
transparent meaning that weak is weak
strong is strong so I feel like on
average if you face two checks people
are usually just not going to have it
it's kind of my conclusion I would say
here here the 37 go for a check rise I
think it's a nice hand unblocks a lot
his folds it turns a lot of straight
draws with the flush draw so then I
think we can bet pot or slide over on
the turn very often so with small C here
with 78 on like this two Broadway board
there these boards are just going to be
very good for
you on the turn think 7 eight not having
a nine I think is good so Jack nine
Queen nine or like call F in his range
it's kind of considering what kind of
strategy I would use there I don't
really think we're very incentivized to
bet bet off uh bet again with like third
pairs so then I feel like betting a bit
bigger is fine so I feel like betting
something like a St plus and then
something sometimes adding in obviously
some checks feel like that's going to be
well here let me see I think we almost
have a straight flush so let's start
investing because I'm an optimistic guy
and you know you want to invest in your
optimism that's not a straight flush
feel like I could probably bet this end
again should be strong enough and I feel
like I unblock quite a lot of the king
jacks ajck off suits and stuff like that
on a
queen feel like he's done already quite
some folding don't block Queen I blocked
the flush like seven8 7 n of space 8 n
of space so I feel like something like
King 10 or nine 10 suited that blocks a
queen would have been would be better so
I'm just going to give this one up oh he
called again with check 10 that's a bit
of a loose
call one of the reasons why I liked
uh why I liked the 98 on the turn so
that he has more hands like that like I
don't I didn't block any Jacks and my
optimism did not get rewarded here for's
a MIM race and I have this guy tack as
recreational let's try to get in there
and let's try a Dunkey let's try out a
double
dunk definely when when he M raises we
can get in here with Deuces fours five
sixes all that type of good
stuff my strategy here is going to do a
lot of block betting again here I'm
going to check with the 67
I feel like on a turn we want to go very
big or check and I just don't think
67 strong enough to go big or check uh
big in big bet so then what's left is
check and I feel like the four is pretty
good for him we block off the folding
range I feel like just giving up here
first two players is probably the best
idea and he folded here with the Jack
four so our
double luckily we did not hit a heart
there
here we get a call cold call from this
guy this seems to be a board that
connects pretty decent with cold call
ranges or at least if we can put this
guy in a Range uh that being said I'm
still just going to go for a
cat and go from there check the turn
definitely have to fold on the river
here I'm going to go for the check race
with the
54 and here be I don't see any any hand
that missed so going to fold
here probably a recreational player
again from Germany see if this guy wants
to get involved as well also a 5,000
hand real money player shout out to
you let's go
sir cashed out no
resumes runs at
once similar story as earlier with 67
however now there's not a
recreational player in the big blind but
you know still we get a good price what
I like with 67 suit is that we can
represent sets without having a set
that's
uh that's I think the true power of
these sued connectors so let's see if we
can flop a six or a seven and then play
it like a set this pretty decent B for
me I would
say gold calling from the small blind so
let's lead out
probably close to range but we are
playing for Donkey from dkey from New
Zealand Donkey from New Zealand got a
donkey donkey himself Queen 10
seeting expecting an overfall and that's
just how we're going to make money king
T
suited TR forbat there ISO from
Brazil H Queen 10 this is a lot of
way no diamond going to go for a check
but would not hate to do something
else
here start with a
10% going to call with the queen
10 probably checking the
river betting half pot I think here
again with King 10 is fine and bluffing
anything
that's not a flush complete if my
internet allows it to because apparently
we're disconnecting and with the queen
10 here we checked again I believe this
guy's probably a recreational player
probably just going to call and hope for
the best he calls I'm probably folding
yes this is very this is very tense okay
yeah that's not a great River I'm going
to give that one up and he calls okay
well in that case I'm
out oh [ __ ] I wanted to see what
happened
ah got out kicked Queen Jack the
imposition player had oh the other guy
called with pocket sixes so definitely
recreational player and the King 10 you
know just going to give that one up this
board I'll play very different in this
positions I think just starting with
one3 cat here is fine but in later
positions I would definitely have a
different strategy I feel like under the
gun you know we we just hit this board
so well that just seeing a lot I think
is good here it TS
there a recreational I'm going to bet
again and pocket think it's easy to
check yeah he checked pretty fast this
is pretty
close you didn't even consider value
betting huh feel the position are a bit
too tight to Value bet pocket a here but
I'm very tempted
to luckily I didn't that's kind of the
thinging right because like a nine is a
bit more of a quote quote easy check
when your big one first under the gun
but if he showed like the same timing I
would definitely definitely Patrick bat
if I was in a later position cuz then a
nine has to think about it but
uh now a nine it's a bit bit of an
easier check so to speak B
King these low boards are going to be
very good for
us in these three rep pots since we will
have hand like King 7 off and stuff like
that that being said I don't think Ace
King really benefits a lot from betting
so I'm going to go for a check and
definitely calling wouldn't mind raising
some different suits but I feel like
this hand calling is
fine I'm probably either calling or
raising the river like raising is
probably going to be slightly
better raising to a sizing where I feel
like I could represent Aces or a five
feel like those are definitely going to
be still in my value
range Aces King five a internet is not
uh helping us today let's see what the
result is okay we Face a gem well in
that case we're out this guy I'm not
really sure if this guy is a
recreational player or not if it's a
recreational player betting big I think
it's by far the best play if he's not I
want to bet
small pretty sure it's I think it's
actually a recreational so I went for
the for the bigger bet there limp
from early is from Germany unlikely I
would say to
be W so probably
recreational I'm going to check
and kind of
see what develops he checks very fast
again so it's unlikely I think that
we're beat I think I'm now going to make
a value
bet I think there's a very big
difference between solver GTO and in
practice because people that especially
recreationals they're going to give you
a lot of information if you check back
the reason why you would see that range
on the board is because you have an
advantage and checking back and when you
have an advantage you know C betting is
just going to outperform a check back
because in a check pack especially in a
board where you have an advantage the
out of position is not going to do
anything but obviously your recreational
things different so yeah don't just uh
rain seabat vers recreationals in
certain spots here I had a I would play
a bigger bet check on ace910
specifically and then probably use my
lower parid Diamond I wouldn't mind to
always been Deuces trees is maybe
pushing it a bit over B here with the
ACE
check here we keep on checking now we
check here with the
threes and we win would have probably
needed to call this some of the time
versus a bet simply because we unblock
all the Bluffs and we block his main
value which would be like and like Ace
three Ace do obviously we don't block
Ace do but you you get the point like I
love these weaker
Aces I feel like pocket 3 there probably
a call on the river he probably checked
back King high or something nope he just
he just didn't bite he had six3 suited
he actually was blocking the calling
range so would have been okay Bluff he's
unblocking the falling range which would
be king queen king Jack or in general
like King five Su King six suited or
something I would say defitely had you
should he should Bluff it on the river
quite often King Jack 643 this is going
to be very high check back board for
me and the big BL should probably lead
if the big BL doesn't lead the way you
make money here is just by getting to
see a turn and then over fold so if he
now stabs you might think like ah King
Jack WS blah blah but I saw a turn which
is already amazing uh and he's even
going to let me see the river which is
even more
amazing so I'm very happy so far how
this hand went Maybe even win versus
King 10 you never know but likely just
his ace
high yeah could maybe consider bluffing
King Jack there you we're going to check
back almost rain in that flop and on
turn we're going to check back a lot
again so maybe just over betting River
it's going to be pretty good I was
thinking maybe like obviously if you
have if I have lower like King Nine
would definitely Bluff and I thought
like Queen Jacks but I would probably
also start bluffing like some Queen
jacks on the turn so maybe actually the
king Jack is a bit of a weak played hand
SC is
3.5x usually an indicator of a bit of a
stronger
range so what I'm actually going to do
here especially for this stack is going
to check
back because I don't really want to get
re raed and same now vers a DK I would
much rather race Ace Queen without
without the a diamonds simply because
then I don't mind getting re raed and
also then he could call me with the not
flusher for example
there it is there's the
king there's the king we were looking
for Ace King always gets there it always
gets there interesting checkback here on
DUS sking King I don't
think should have any check packs he
checks back again he probably
has a worse Ace than me this is a board
you should definitely be careful on C
betting do I want to do something with
King
Jack don't mind the float let's see what
develops snap checks well now we play
the board that's not good let's go for
an overb
then let's hope he doesn't put us on
bucket Deuces actually I would
probably check race quite a lot of the
Bluffs and given the fact that he snap
checked the turn I think we had Ace Jack
plus we could definely just
overb Race 10 maybe even check six
rainbow just going to range
B bucket sixes versus memor is call the
button this seems to be easy check back
G to play overb check Queen 10
definitely not not strong enough to do
anything Eight Is Not Great snap check
definitely going to fail your bet now
versus a snap Che and hope he doesn't
have
King 10 but I feel like King 10 is going
to think in these later positions so
this was very similar to the pocket
eights situation we had earlier and
pocket six I think check again I would
probably step like some of my lowest
pairs with a heart on the Flop so we had
our pocket fours or something maybe we
could start stepping in on a turn it
just gets a bit more better hands and
fold like fives and sixes and sixes you
know just gets a little has a little bit
more Showdown value versus for example
four is and five so therefore I think
checking is fine this guy thinks about
for quite a while that's a B I think we
just fold there's not much much else to
do there's a limp Queen and off it's a
bit loose and there's also recreational
small blind so I'm going to fold pocket
10 I think is strong enough where it
comes to the point we never have to
consider folding so I'm going to
call and check all the Flop bucket
Queens can either forat or
call I rolled a four B uh a call no wait
I rolled a four forb okay so go for the
forbat 10 probably check folding if I
had n obviously it's an easy easy
continue if we don't have a heart it's
probably a continue that's kind of
theistic to look for in these type of
spots I don't think we have a bet on the
river with bucket tense
here positions are simply too tight here
I'm going to seeb
with pocket Queens
and he checks back with Ace King with
the Ace of Hearts oh wow that's
definitely a hand B should Barrel the
turn with I would say on Queen 587 turn
two hearts just a bit passively played
by him it's unusual for Brazilian here
the queen start with of
cat yeah probably barreling usually like
you're overpress with a heart let's say
we had Kings or Aces a a
Hearts A of Hearts A of Spates or
something that hand that would say it's
a high frequency check on the turn same
with
Kings but maybe you know because we're a
little bit deeper as well maybe Queens
would make an in a check maybe I'm over
playing this hand now I'm not 100% sure
feel like right now you know it's just
jam and hope he doesn't slow didn't slow
play
Aces oh it C me down with nines but yeah
so ristics there for for turn check is
basically you're going to check hands
that that block the calling range and
like I said it's usually going to be
your overpar with a heart and then
probably the ones that block the floats
for example I had the four of the Queen
of Clubs which reduces King Queen of
Clubs Ace Queen of Clubs so there's less
Bluffs in his range so therefore I think
betting is slightly better or at least
that was my
consideration here pocket T now this is
IR regular and therefore uh I think just
range betting is a bit better because
the EV of check is decreased assuming
that you know he going to play well
facing a check pack so now there's just
not a lot of extra money to be gained
see Bing go for check R think we have an
easy fold here with pocket
tense if that queens or Kings I
definitely think we're calling but I
feel like pocket tense is just a fault
so yeah we're going to be uh be wrapping
