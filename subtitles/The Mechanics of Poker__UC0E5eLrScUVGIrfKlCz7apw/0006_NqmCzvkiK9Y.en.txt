[00:00]
any open gems i love it i love it
i love it so basically uh it could have
ace king without any heart
that would make a lot of sense
how much am i getting 38 percent

[00:19]
i cannot chat okay [ __ ] it guys good
luck
all right all right all right all right
so far no lag seems good got a visit

[00:32]
so far no lag seems good got a visit
from the internet guy who
installed a new modem
so let's see if that does some wonders
meanwhile we forbaded the ace four and

[00:46]
meanwhile we forbaded the ace four and
now we get cold format
in general i think this range is quite
tight
and you could call this
uh i'm gonna approach it a little bit
more of a but
a little bit more a little bit more of a

[01:00]
a little bit more a little bit more of a
nittier way
like if these are probably close and
just to keep myself in check i will uh
just to keep myself in check i will just

[01:15]
just to keep myself in check i will just
say like okay i if i shoot it all
i'll call kings here we get donk bed
which i think actually
is a good play

[01:30]
attorney checks i think with kings
exactly we have a check

[01:47]
and under if we have a value but
but i think it's a good dunk for him
because the four six deuce is definitely
a board i'm going to be
spot controlling on quite a lot

[02:01]
spot controlling on quite a lot
as basically i will not raise deuces 4 6
on this table and he will have them all
so basically
dunking will prevent me from pot
controlling
if you guys didn't join the discord
community yet you guys should join the
discord community

[02:15]
discord community
i guess we can start to create some
milestones in our discord community see
we can get some cool
some cool yeah like achievement
milestones
what would you like to see happening if
we reach

[02:30]
we reach
1k subscribers 2k subscribers is that a
lot is that
i have no clue how much do we have i
think
200 i'll leave the exact numbers up to
gilly he knows best
but i'll leave the exact things that's

[02:46]
but i'll leave the exact things that's
gonna happen i'll leave that up to the
community i think that's uh
i think that's a good idea
jam done okay good luck
and we get general the truth as well
good luck

[03:02]
assume hand oh [ __ ] i i have to cash out
options still on
oh we we're losing the first one
and we're chopping the second one
wait he cast out i hope he cast out

[03:18]
wait he cast out i hope he cast out
yes he cashed out
that's good for us
let's play a part here versus the
recreational
for the person who asked about tags
anything green

[03:31]
anything green
don't if you saw but anything green is a
fish
or a recreational player fight
is there anything like can you call can
you use the word fish
uh is that a thing

[03:48]
uh is that a thing
or should i always say recreational i
rarely ever see content creators or
streamers or something say fish they
always say recreationals
let me know if i'm if i'm allowed to say

[04:01]
let me know if i'm if i'm allowed to say
fish yes or no
okay gilly is making it hard to get to
play to get into the discord but it's
good stuff guys
actually the newsletter as well is good
stuff releasing very
uh content on there that we don't

[04:15]
uh content on there that we don't
release on social medias
i have my three lessons learned which i
always like to make
usually at the end of the month i get
asked renee what did you learn this
month my friend
and then i give them like a bunch of

[04:30]
and then i give them like a bunch of
stuff that i learned
so if you want to know more about that
what i learned month by month
never stop learning you should sign up
to the newsletter
in the meal i'll take a little zip of my

[04:45]
in the meal i'll take a little zip of my
tea and actually i found out that you
guys are basically watching nothing
and just because we're in the mood we're
gonna go for a little for about here

[05:02]
and it went through let's flop a
straight flush here
uh getting punished or are we gonna
it makes it quite small we can still i'm
gonna i'm gonna cooler

[05:16]
gonna i'm gonna cooler
cooler score here okay okay okay okay
flop
open ender
hx definitely don't want to get check
race so i'll check back

[05:37]
[Music]
he checks again this is probably the
point i should do
some betting

[05:46]
if he has a king i think he's just going
to fold right
oh and we got him with the good old 35
suited

[06:01]
suited
if you could get coaching from anyone
poker who's top three
quite interesting i would say limitless
would definitely be one of them this
who else who else i would get poker

[06:15]
who else who else i would get poker
coaching from
gotcha limitless kacha
limitless kacha i'm trying to think of
the third one
i'd love someone love to be like someone
creative you know

[06:31]
creative you know
what is the correct sizing here i got
just better sizing for which i can
vape it quite thinly
who else do i think is i want the
creative basically i'm looking for some

[06:45]
creative basically i'm looking for some
people
you know probably probably some people
would have expected
oh of course man for getting creative
player mr baron of course
i have to remove these other scenes or
at least i cannot use the numpad because
basically the num lock keys

[07:00]
basically the num lock keys
they refer to i think some old scenes
that we used
in oh someone is interested hi there mr
danny
so mr dani is mr danny going to be
looser or
tighter given that there's a fish here

[07:19]
i'm going to go for a looser so i'll be
more inclined to slowplay my aces
and i'll show you how when i'll show you
how to make money in poker guys
you should get two aces have a low flop

[07:32]
you should get two aces have a low flop
called the four bet and just let the guy
do something
that's it that's a secret
danu here from russia

[07:49]
nuts run out

[08:00]
yes sir king 10 thank you
thank you thank you russia
mother russia
that's how you do it guys that's it

[08:15]
that's how you do it guys that's it
it's as easy as that get aces
and let the guy barrel off
interesting question here from hollow
bean do you look do you lose your skill
while
when you just play very little and how

[08:30]
when you just play very little and how
do you update how do you keep up to date
to teach people why you don't play
i think actually understanding how to
teach poker understanding how to play
poker it's actually
something different and i actually found
it to be
hard to kind of balance the two that's
kind of the phase where i'm currently in

[08:49]
but people often often mistaking like
that a good player is necessarily a good
teacher
um
it's something that sometimes gets

[09:00]
it's something that sometimes gets
overrated
yeah i think i have a
call could i raise his hands could he
have eight
no i tense i would raise but nice i
guess i will just call
and in the meanwhile here we're gonna

[09:15]
and in the meanwhile here we're gonna
cooler our friend
goose core straight flush okay well at
least we have a pair that's not bad
nine half flop is nine and eight is not
very good because it will definitely
connect with this four betting range
here we make a small bet and he folds

[09:34]
and he opened gems i love it i love it
i love it so basically uh it could have
ace king without any heart
that would make a lot of sense

[09:47]
how much am i getting 38 percent how
much do i have
oh goosey goosey
let's have 25 versus his mate hands he
can

[10:00]
can
nine you can have ace king without a
heart
i think ace king without hearts are
probably a good play he could have a
flush on himself
he could have draw himself like jack
queen this is quite close

[10:16]
queen this is quite close
but i'll hope for the ace king without a
heart
i cannot chat okay [ __ ] it guys good
luck
jack queen yes he had the jack queen

[10:31]
jack queen yes he had the jack queen
i'll resume the hand no thank you oh he
hits
no way okay
fair fair fair fair i like his gem
i think ace king without a heart there
and jaquie are definitely good answer
gem with

[10:45]
gem with
and i mean i still have like 25 or
something versus his value range so
i think that is a good hand to play that
way
i don't want to give away too much of
the text with someone asking
what is like the best tech this is going
to be super narcissistic

[11:00]
to be super narcissistic
but i will explain
so the best racks are gold which
basically
at some point i had like better wrecks
that gold you know your linuses
your big blind bats your otbs they're

[11:17]
your big blind bats your otbs they're
all gold and actually what i noticed
when i started to play against them
basically because i had them tacked as
gold
basically before the game even began i
was already one zero behind because in
my mind it was like
i'm playing against a gold guy uh

[11:31]
i'm playing against a gold guy uh
and i noticed it yeah it would just [ __ ]
a little bit with my mind
we're flopping a set again how is this
possible
only sets they talked about this twitch
good run guys i'm really
really happy that i'm experiencing it

[11:45]
really happy that i'm experiencing it
and is this this crazy guy that we
played against earlier
that i forgot to tag anyway
ah so bad because this guy did do some
funky stuff
but actually to go back to that story so
i noticed that basically every time i
would sit down against

[12:00]
would sit down against
gold players yeah i would just already
be one zero
behind before the game even start so
then i felt like okay i'll use this
psychology
in my favor so i untacked everyone who
had gold
and only made myself gold so it's kind

[12:15]
and only made myself gold so it's kind
of a
psychological confidence boost thingy
as you can see now gold is only reserved
for
myself explode and poker clue
aka the poker ambition

[12:32]
gang students yeah the students
the students didn't don't don't have the
gold tag yet but there's definitely a
couple who are knocking on the door
and actually there was another question
which i started
never finished due to mr sondheimer

[12:47]
never finished due to mr sondheimer
jamming away with the jack queen that
kind of
broke my thought process obviously i had
to think about the hand for a little
while
[Music]
but yeah the question i think was if you

[13:01]
but yeah the question i think was if you
lose your skill when not playing so
basically what i've done for the last
two years for the people who didn't
see it exclamation point youtube
i think actually it's also one of the
banners that sometimes comes by where it
says who is the weko
basically i went in the lab for two

[13:15]
basically i went in the lab for two
years you could say mainly focused on
trying to get a group of students up to
a higher level
as i always thought that
um i did not necessarily think

[13:34]
um i did not necessarily think
i was that special i mean i kind of felt
like well
i mean if if i can do it then why can't
someone else
because i didn't necessarily think that

[13:47]
i got poker to success due to me being
talented or
smart in some sort of way that is quite
interesting
i'm getting 17 but this checker is
quite small actually this could be a

[14:00]
quite small actually this could be a
hand like eight seven eight nine
yeah the problem though is if i call on
a and i make my hand i'm not even that
happy but
i think i'll call and make my hand and
then be happy against the
fun player and not be happy versus the

[14:16]
fun player and not be happy versus the
um versus the reg he checks
it starts that's that really feels like
i had like eight seven
eight nine he checks back as well this
can still be anything
check as well okay and now we're

[14:30]
check as well okay and now we're
probably beat unless he has eight nine
it's interesting
okay eight nine versus eight six

[14:45]
okay eight nine versus eight six
one time ninths
versus king so i was very far off
so basically what what holiday asked so
i went in the lab for two years i think
i was there right with my story

[15:00]
i was there right with my story
i was in the lab for two years uh
because oh yeah because i thought if i
can do it everyone can do it that was
kind of the story right
because basically i thought it was just
like a couple of things that
i was doing well that was definitely

[15:15]
i was doing well that was definitely
explainable to other people
so we decided to focus on that
i've kind of lost my track my thought
process here one second
man playing playing and telling stories

[15:30]
man playing playing and telling stories
that have enough to playing and
commentating on the hands is not that
hard but playing
and telling another story that's
something i have to get used to
but luckily we have the fault with an
eye that gives gives us some peace
so yeah basically i don't think uh what

[15:46]
so yeah basically i don't think uh what
it kind of came down to
if you're just basically studying poker
and try to figure out how to best
explain it
that's i think a part of the learning
process basically
they have i think they have a saying
right like you can only monitor
something
uh once you can explain it to other

[16:01]
uh once you can explain it to other
people so actually i thought
that that was kind of a part that was
still missing
in my poker career
so yeah i think actually you know i
think i think actually the fact that i
went sort of in the lab for two years

[16:16]
went sort of in the lab for two years
made me first of all way better player
and
a way better coach i mean because you
have to learn
a lot of things that you do or that i
did uh when i was just
focused on playing it's very intuitive
and basically i would say that coaching

[16:30]
and basically i would say that coaching
or becoming a content creator or
becoming a poker teacher
whatever you want to call it it's a big
part of that is
making the intuitive uh
trying to make the intuitive translate
the intuitive is something that you can
explain

[16:45]
explain
basically
i'll go for an alphabet why not why not
why not why not
and actually like and that's actually i
thought a really cool a cool thing about
the coaching

[17:00]
the coaching
project that we did basically because
in that process of trying to make your
intuitive knowledge conscious and try to
explain it you actually spot a lot of
flaws
because basically you say yeah you know
i do this because of that and that and
when you ex

[17:15]
when you ex
want to explain something i mean you
want to be sure that what you're trying
to explain is right
[Music]
oh i cannot use the numpad keys

[17:31]
now we're at this table
so you know you have to explain and
often i kind of catch myself like oh
wait actually this is not even true
this was a flaw in my own game it was
quite close
i was doubting between half pot and

[17:48]
i was doubting between half pot and
i think i think the only thing here i
can do is rip it in but i'm not very
happy about it
it's basically just a little bit better
i think than calling but yeah

[18:03]
and in the other board we get tripled on
it smells a little bit like
ace king flush does complete
i mean the thing is ace eight is
probably an okay i had to call with

[18:15]
probably an okay i had to call with
compared to that like a standard jack
then check check queen he could be
bigger with a couple of those hands
let's see it
then jack yes yes

[18:30]
then jack yes yes
thank you explodes if you're watching
this
because we just got off a session that
we did for
our cfp for the upcoming lesson and
actually a concept that we talked about
came back in this hand so i'll

[18:46]
came back in this hand so i'll
i'll dedicate this 300 to my good friend
explode
aka flowmaster importance of studying
guys
never stop you can still learn so
much um yeah the fight for i mean

[19:00]
much um yeah the fight for i mean
basically if you
probably actually that hand we will put
in the youtube highlights
basically if you look at that hand
you will hear me say name name a couple
of hands that he could play this way

[19:17]
of hands that he could play this way
and yeah basically if your opponent
doesn't play those hands that way yeah
you should not call
because obviously versus only value you
don't do that well
i think here with king 10 it's quite
interesting yeah we should probably make

[19:31]
interesting yeah we should probably make
a race
we should probably make a race
i'm not that happy about it
but i'm not that happy about it yes he

[19:45]
but i'm not that happy about it yes he
has a lower flush
sometimes something sometimes something
also goes wrong guys
if you have any more questions come come
to the q a on insta which will start in
20 minutes
[Music]
what else that's it

[20:00]
what else that's it
tomorrow again four o'clock thank you
for all the people that are tuning in i
hope you enjoyed it
