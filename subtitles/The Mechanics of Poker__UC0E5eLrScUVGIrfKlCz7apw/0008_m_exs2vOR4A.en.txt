[00:01]
[Music]
let me see let me see what
i'm gonna bet
and we fix i don't have queen jack
okay guys tough decision tough decision

[00:15]
okay guys tough decision tough decision
just call it just kali
all right all right all right all right
all right guys
i think we are live
and just as the last time um

[00:30]
and just as the last time um
first three minutes just to before we
start playing some hands to have some
people enter
i was going over my pre-session hands i
already watched 18 hands
remember these were hands that i go
through before playing
that for me demonstrate a certain

[00:46]
that for me demonstrate a certain
concept that i want to have top of mind
while playing
um i don't know which this hand is
i have ace five
okay yeah so this is i think is for
example a good example of a hand

[01:00]
example a good example of a hand
for me it clearly shows i'm trying to
trap a fish
oh sorry fun player
luckily no one watched yet so uh
for the fun player and in general i
think i have like six hands in here in

[01:15]
think i have like six hands in here in
my presets and that's where i try to
trap a fun player
yeah that basically against fun players
i want to kind of
save my checks for bluff catching and if
i have a good hand i want to focus more
on just trying to get as money
as as much money and as possible and

[01:30]
as as much money and as possible and
sometimes i guess i still kind of
fall victim of a sort of trapping
mindset for example i
would have liked to see myself lead here
with the 10 jack of spades
um because he's going to bet very
polarized on the river

[01:45]
polarized on the river
i don't i do think if i check he will
bluff i mean that's kind of actually
what you see quite often here with fun
players
that they don't value that thinly but if
he has 910 he will bluff
um but i think a hand like 10 jack of
spades is definitely strong enough to

[02:00]
spades is definitely strong enough to
just bet out itself
and i would just reserve bluff catching
before i had like queen
7 suited or whatever bad hero call
and then mainly i don't mean like ah i
shouldn't make bad hero calls oh really
but there's like a concept behind when

[02:17]
but there's like a concept behind when
something like i have some good hero
calls in here and i have some bad hero
here and by looking at them before i
start playing i kind of uh
yeah i can i can see that i can start
seeing the difference i think this
actually was another example that i
tried to slow play or

[02:31]
tried to slow play or
i tried to play it basically and the guy
just got the fun player just called an
eight
[ __ ] my life uh so yeah
i think that's definitely uh so you guys
can hold me accountable
if i try to slow play or versus fun

[02:47]
if i try to slow play or versus fun
players with very strong hands like here
that's
uh you guys should say mr wacko
that's not what we agreed upon doing
this session right
then i'll say you're very right that was

[03:00]
then i'll say you're very right that was
a clear mistake by me
all right but without further ado let's
get into
some action huh i know that's what you
guys are here for
so am i actually and as

[03:17]
so am i actually and as
i'm your player and your dj at the same
time
you know since we cannot have any
parties due to the
corona situation we we bring the party
to the switch stream

[03:30]
to the switch stream
that's kind of how it works right
calling
we'll be raising this flop

[03:57]
calls interesting turn

[04:00]
calls interesting turn
you look at what i'm raising on the flop
this exact hand
what do i want to do with this exact
hand i mean i can have loose sevens i
can have some boats both don't really
want a bad big however
there are some hands up on the bed big

[04:16]
there are some hands up on the bed big
yeah i think this hand wants a bit big
he could if he had a better king like
ace king king queen he could have three
bet the flop some of the time
so i think it's very likely that we have
the best hand

[04:33]
i think he can call us with worse he can
fold some draws so
all goodness with that sizing
one the fun player min race the small
blind called i decided to try to flop a

[04:45]
blind called i decided to try to flop a
straight
we're almost there that's not it
but it's it's not a bad card he did pop
the flop though so
a little bit concerned he does decide to
slow down a little bit which i'm happy
for
because you know i'm dutch so

[05:02]
because you know i'm dutch so
we like discounts and this
was the focus point guys we shouldn't
try to
trap with strong hands versus a fish i'm
just gonna bat big see if he calls me

[05:16]
just gonna bat big see if he calls me
like something like a jack or something
that's why you set focus points guys
that is why you set focus points
what did he call me with yeah you see he
would have checked that behind

[05:32]
same if if i'm around someone who has a
very strong accent without
without me wanting to actually start to
copy his accent
with two hands here we have

[05:46]
with two hands here we have
the five six suited where we get three
bet we call and flop a six
and the jax he's still debating if he
four bets we're probably calling
he four bets

[06:02]
there we go we flop decent i would say
not bad not bad and on table two we
called as well and we turned decent

[06:15]
see i think there's not a lot of reason
here
to raise even though we have quite a lot
of equity
can we get better across the fold
i think i'm going to jam it in

[06:35]
i think i'm going to jam it in
and on table one gonna check color with
the jacks
interesting turn

[06:47]
and then i'll get back to the 5 6 suited

[07:11]
is a hard time in this hand preflop as
well

[07:15]
well
think
[Music]
what is bluffs should we fast by this i
mean we block
jack

[07:35]
yeah i'm gonna fast play this
there are some action kills versus i had
like ace queen asus
like for example an 8 would have been

[07:45]
like for example an 8 would have been
action killer i was debating calling and
then if
action killer if an action killer would
come i would
probably bet up myself that was kind of
what i was debating
um

[08:02]
the thing is like we cannot really call
rivers unimproved
so yeah but we will get bluffed by a
hand like jack knight suited queen
unsuited
jack queen i think these are all hands
that are probably going to bluff me

[08:15]
that are probably going to bluff me
all of rivers yeah then we're
going to fall i mean if an eight or a
knight comes you could say we could
maybe bluff but i think then
basically if he checks on the knife for
example i think he will follow
true on his blast mainly so then he
probably has a check car as we can still

[08:31]
probably has a check car as we can still
his queen i know i i just thought that
playability on rivers would be quite
poor
looking at it so that's why i decided to
jam
basically it's like some some bluff

[08:45]
basically it's like some some bluff
prevention
and i mean yeah if we get cold we have
quite a lot of faculty
so i don't really mind it i don't think
in my head as well i thought we could
make him fold a better draw but i don't
actually think that
uh that that is really the case

[09:00]
uh that that is really the case
they stay over here and we have a cold
format

[09:17]
he calls
you can play this flop a couple of
different ways i'll go for the
small bet

[09:30]
gonna be quite hard for him to defend if
you look at how it goes range versus
range
you can also start checking back and
maybe induce some things i think kings
without the
with the club it's a bit harder to get

[09:45]
with the club it's a bit harder to get
called by a worse hand
i think we should probably just check
if i had kings without a club i could
maybe consider
i could consider blocking again getting

[10:02]
i could consider blocking again getting
caught by a king i flushed her or
something but yeah that's not not really
the case
and i think versus block we kind of have
to oh
even though i'm not very happy about it

[10:15]
even though i'm not very happy about it
yeah two aces okay we got away quite
cheaply there
that's good that's good barrel on the

[10:30]
turn

[10:55]
[Music]
mm-hmm

[11:00]
mm-hmm
and i think on the river we have check
with this exact hand
um i mean we're not blocking any

[11:16]
um i mean we're not blocking any
middling hands that he could be see
betting
like 910 jack nine but then again he
could also be checking back like some
queen jack
what i think i think i want to see what

[11:31]
what i think i think i want to see what
he has the queen 10. it's kind of the
thing i'm not really sure what a
seabedding frequency is here on the flop
uh versus guys who have a little bit of
a lower c-bat
would check back these type of hands
more often

[11:47]
so yeah i guess that's what you could
decide it on
i think that's kind of the the main
factor so uh versus a high seabird i
think we have a good call on the river
versus the lower sea better i think we

[12:00]
versus the lower sea better i think we
don't have a good go on the river
because basically yeah he has to show up
with bluffs and the bluffs are
two cards in the middle of the seven and
the queen i would say
those are like his most likely hands but
those could also be good checking
candidate
hey i ran across your youtube channel

[12:15]
hey i ran across your youtube channel
and really have liked the videos thank
you very much
very helpful stuff the bluffing one
really helped me out in my thought
processes that's kind of i
i'm very i'm really hoping that that's
kind of you take away from
the video because especially

[12:32]
the video because especially
actually in any in any
[Music]
in any few people like to copy what
other people say but i think that's
especially true in poker
so once a couple of people start to
steer poker in a certain way then

[12:45]
steer poker in a certain way then
everyone
just kind of follows without thinking
about it for themselves
and i don't think this is uh
this is this is not necessarily very

[13:00]
this is this is not necessarily very
beneficial so when i
started to make content i really wanted
actually i started to make content
because i thought i had a different
way of approaching the game different
philosophy towards a game a different
way of thinking
so i thought i could bring something to
the current poker industry which was

[13:16]
the current poker industry which was
lacking
so yeah i'm really hope i'm really happy
especially like i focus a lot
with my students as well on thought
processes
uh because that's usually where i'd see
go wrong we decided to

[13:30]
go wrong we decided to
limpy limpy with the ace 8 and the flop
is not very favorable
but i think with exactly this end we
probably have to do something right

[13:47]
probably have to do something right
let's make a race
turn actually turn a bear

[14:01]
turn actually turn a bear
is not necessarily that bad

[14:15]
this doesn't really make much sense in
my opinion
why would you mean that here

[14:30]
why would you mean that here
okay i have no [ __ ] clue what's going
on with this head
this guy's [ __ ] with me interesting
river

[14:48]
what the [ __ ] is going on in this hand

[15:03]
that was the weirdest head i've ever
played no that's not true
ever played on stream i mean only stream
twice so
it's not very hard to do that was a
weird hand are you in the chat
are you in the chat mr espacela

[15:18]
are you in the chat mr espacela
and are you just trying to see how i
will respond
that was a weird hand that was a very
weird hand
but he didn't bite huh he didn't bite oh

[15:31]
but he didn't bite huh he didn't bite oh
fellow a poker ambition coach explode in
the mix
trying to limp him from the small blind
uh sir
six seven suited queen jack
good hand can kind of go either way

[15:46]
good hand can kind of go either way
quite a low number so i'll go for a
check
and we hit we hit we hit
we hit we hit
ah this is quite a good song guys i have

[16:01]
ah this is quite a good song guys i have
to say
[Music]
let me see let me see what i'm gonna bet
and we fix i don't have queen jack

[16:15]
okay guys tough decision tough decision
just call it just cali
oh worst river in the deck
how does this river come seriously
a pear and a flush like you would say

[16:30]
a pear and a flush like you would say
don't pair the board
don't bring a flush what do they do they
do both
and basically now everything got there
so four
six not really worth much ah and he over
bets

[16:45]
he over bets

[17:03]
don't have a club which is actually good
at that i don't have a diamond
because if you decide to continue
bluffing it's probably with a diamond
i think i still have to call

[17:16]
as i said it's probably good that i
don't have a diamond because if he
decides to bluff it's probably with a
diamond
why the
trapping me preflop

[17:30]
it's this guy this guy's from the
philippines guys
the philippines represent
probably not going to be a white white
christmas in the philippines

[17:45]
but uh he's trying to trap me i think
probably should three web most of the
time i don't think
you should check raise the turn i was
thinking more event like age
jack ace queen could be but i thought
also maybe i had like

[18:00]
also maybe i had like
i don't know ace tree with a diamond or
random ace diamond with an eight
something like that
or maybe like three nine suited

[18:20]
you
