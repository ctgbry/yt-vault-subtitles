Bluff something with the Queen of Hearts

you're really bluffing the queen of
hearts seems a little bit optimistic

[00:47]
welcome back guys to another wacko show
yeah we got the little mint 3 Bet here
it looks like we're gonna get sucked in
and flop a flush
oh he actually manages to fold
oh I ain't oh that's a good flop

[01:01]
oh I ain't oh that's a good flop
or at least you know
if we are peeling three bets then this
is quite decent starts off with a small
back that's also so far before I'm
liking my situation
it's not necessarily the turn I wanted
but hey

[01:18]
I think I'm still gonna pee we could
still be betting like the same hand like
some random Ace King High
we have a three if he has an overpower
we have an out

[01:48]
foreign
off not happy about it but
let's draw a little ten percent

[02:15]
any faults she Breaky man [ __ ] hell
moves to the Netherlands and becomes
cheap ten percent of four four dollar
twenty twenty dollar
twenty dollar
look at this suited and connected

[02:30]
look at this suited and connected
gonna go for it
[Music]

[02:51]
come on a little fight by Bluff we're
defense for the fans on stream okay it's
a flip hey thank you always runs once
huh
damn that guy runs good versus me

[03:01]
damn that guy runs good versus me
because every time when when I made it I
say oh yeah he's the guy who runs once
and I always lose
maybe that's his special power
but remember we talked about this his
strategy was to try to put people on
tilt so we're gonna go Zen

[03:23]
foreign

[03:49]
cost of flat I mean go to
um there's a site called nubio
n-u-m-b-e-o

[04:00]
and nubio yeah you can compare cost of
living there you see the average cost of
every city Etc now you can kind of
compare cities which is quote quote
better but I mean I moved around a lot
and in my opinion quality of life is
really

[04:15]
really
relative to what has a higher preference
for you for example
me and my wife as well Sunny climate is
very
uh
so that's for us that's way higher on

[04:30]
so that's for us that's way higher on
the list than maybe for other people
let's play a part of Mr bricky again
whether they actually check down with
when we had the five three okay there's
Jack
with a heart

[04:47]
flop two pair that ain't bad
to pair ain't bad
foreign

[05:35]
make everybody on the turn

[05:45]
probably gonna check behind quite some
Rivers
that being one of them
but I think overbed is still good I
think if I'm that smaller you can just
realize with fours and fives
which I think is opening a little bit

[06:00]
which I think is opening a little bit
more with two recreationals on the table
am I going to check behind
I'm saying that but

[06:17]
[Music]
I think I'm gonna bet
checking behind feels a little bit weak
but it's quite close

[06:33]
any vs Ace King
then so be it a screen could check race
turn some of the time
I do not understand
okay that
that's a good sign

[06:49]
I don't really have I'm basically I'm
saying I have trees and Deuces which
most people are probably not calling but
then again there's two font players in
the pot so
it's likely that
I will have them the plus he could put

[07:02]
I will have them the plus he could put
me on are like flush draws
maybe fours and fives type of Holdings
AVS H4 H5 it's a bad call probably he
should be looking to call hands like
ace10

[07:15]
good that I didn't check back Ace 10 Ace
Jack with a diamond would be like the
the not call hands
yeah there's Jack yeah I figured I had
like that good call
Ace and suited definitely calling isn't
suited maybe a little bit loose

[07:32]
nose it's loose guys it's loose

[07:51]
hey you
losing you're losing your mind

[08:03]
where's the barrel I think we have an
easy call

[08:28]
Jax okay Jax

[08:31]
Jax okay Jax
get rid of David Queens can actually
make a little call here
[Music]

[08:46]
why not

[09:01]
he calls
I'm gonna make a little dunk bed again
so basically to inform you Gilly we open
limp the button button with our last
seven
days and everyone
bot and we we managed to build a bot so

[09:18]
bot and we we managed to build a bot so
you know it was quite it was quite a
cool hand and then afterwards we made a
nice cold four bet and now we're back to
only five six big blinds
so maybe we're cheating a little bit but
you know it's fine

[09:31]
you know it's fine
it's a bad River for the people who are
colorblind there's four hearts in the
Bible and we don't have one anyway
rivers of nine God damn it
seriously we were in such a good shape
in the meanwhile guys we got a little
seven Deuce you think we can win

[09:45]
seven Deuce you think we can win
and win a couple of big blinds here open
three bats raise and take something like
that
he calls I make a c bet and then we've

[10:01]
he calls I make a c bet and then we've
won
that would be great man come on sancti
collaborate here with with the peeps
I'm gonna see that this board one third

[10:15]
[Music]
fault sanctity God damn it
let me hold
[Music]
we're so close thank you

[10:34]
GG guys GG guys we tried
we tried GG guys it's done
oh if he just presses the four button

[10:45]
oh if he just presses the four button
how can we not just get like that 25
faults in that spot
this one is quite interesting

[11:09]
ten six huh
I'm a genius

[11:15]
I'm a genius
oh my God that's got to be the greatest
car in poker a little limpy limpy with
the A3 he calls
sorry I check he bets half what I call
River over bats curious as I am guys

[11:32]
River over bats curious as I am guys
called me showed over to 10-6 10-6 oh my
God
am I the best 10 a minute set say it you
have to say it ten six how sick is that

[11:46]
have to say it ten six how sick is that
how sick is that color with the ace10
I have Jack Queen here if I always find
these interesting boards I'm not really
sure
not very sure sizing wise what to do
usually here

[12:05]
and for turn it's like turn is actually
also quite interesting
maybe I should check some of the time he
check raises okay
this kind of the problem with this exact

[12:15]
this kind of the problem with this exact
hand right wow I was considering
checking because uh basically
we have no we cannot really improve now
that's kind of the problem
I'm still calling but I feel like he's
gonna burrow River at a decent frequency

[12:32]
gonna burrow River at a decent frequency
and basically I cannot improve the board
can only get worse it can pair it can
get a heart
uh so maybe I think I misplayed this
hand
and multiple
parts of the tree

[12:46]
now we actually probably do have the
best hand right
I mean I'm gonna check behind so much
hands it makes no sense if he has a
flush
it would check to me I also don't think
he's gonna call but hey if if he's
calling one percent then it's already

[13:01]
calling one percent then it's already
better than a check back
assuming my read is correct that it
never has a flush here

[13:20]
wait and the life will be gone
and that's what we call a good turn

[13:34]
that's what we call a bad River God damn
it man

[13:51]
we actually also called Uber there with
the ice Jack which is nice
actually makes a check back

[14:00]
actually makes a check back
interesting
foreign
we're going to check all the Flop we

[14:16]
we're going to check all the Flop we
turn quite decent I would say
she got a lead out why not make a little
lead

[14:31]
lead
let's see what he thinks about that
we were actually in a similar spot in
the other stream and actually said oh
maybe I should have let out so I'm
trying to learn from my mistakes
the board Parry isn't great I also see
like some straight some flushes there's
a little bit of everything on the board

[14:48]
goofy guy actually I'm still gonna bat
small again

[15:01]
let me already think a hat if he raises
Avery raises he says he has pocket tents
I don't like him and suited it's
unlikely
okay king switch is very likely

[15:19]
he raises God damn it God damn it
three combination Kings one of tens four

[15:33]
Knights seven
Eights
ten
Bluff something with the Queen of Hearts
I guess

[15:46]
I'm really bluffing the queen of hearts
seems a little bit optimistic
could be bluffing Ace King
I'm gonna make a very nitty fold here
what do you guys think of the

[16:00]
should we have called The River
she could have 10 Jack suited actually I
forgot about that hand that's actually a
decent hand that he could be playing
this way

[16:22]
and Jack suited and then maybe Queens
with a heart but I think people
tend to call that a little bit more
often than race
I mean I can have also turn I can still

[16:32]
I mean I can have also turn I can still
also have
eight tense
actually also have a straight flush who
straight flushes actually six seven Jack
Queen
definitely reasonable hands

[16:45]
definitely reasonable hands
