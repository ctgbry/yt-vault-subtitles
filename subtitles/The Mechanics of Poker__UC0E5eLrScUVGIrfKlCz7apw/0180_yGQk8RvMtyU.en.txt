[00:00]
yeah I think I think anyone studying
blockers before 5K is kind of wasting
their time
you you mentioned that uh at some point
when you were talking with Adam you
mentioned that you were still screwing
up a lot what were some leaks that you

[00:16]
up a lot what were some leaks that you
had to overcome in order to yeah to sort
of earn your place with the big boys
I was like scared to fold because of
people's names
and like like not even like not even
like not even like following Theory

[00:30]
like not even like following Theory
catchers I like I was just like I just
had this image of like what a good
player was and I was like a good player
is someone who runs you over and then I
would just have hands which is just pure
folds in theory and I'd be scared to
fold them because I was like you know
that was just how I had this uh

[00:46]
that was just how I had this uh
to sort of like and I had to you know I
had to actually like you know work on
that and just not like
you know like thinking something Beyond
like
oh my God like I'm playing against Duty
like you know like like I can't fault to

[01:02]
like you know like like I can't fault to
duty he'll know
um like he'll know if I'm folding um and
it's like well yeah so I was like I was
like going way way overboard which is
like I mean it happens to like so many
people when they move up in Stakes is

[01:15]
people when they move up in Stakes is
like they think um
they suddenly like they suddenly think
yeah everyone at the next stake is like
a psycho and can and can see like your
money scared it's like okay I have to
have to like rebel against this money
scared image so it's just like instead
of instead of being money scared I'm

[01:30]
of instead of being money scared I'm
just like handing them my role like
every time they flop a hand
um like yeah obviously you just have to
be you know you have to be somewhere in
the middle like like if you're just yeah
it like like is one thing hero calling
and then it's another thing just like
calling every catcher every time without

[01:45]
calling every catcher every time without
much subtlety and I think it's just like
you know these are smart guys they can
just see that you know they don't
necessarily know why I was doing it
right but like they you know they can
see it and like and then suddenly and
then suddenly like the mistake gets
accentuated because like these guys are

[02:00]
accentuated because like these guys are
just very very quickly
um it's like you can only do that so
many times before you're never seeing a
bluff uh so yeah that was something
which I which I like had to get over
like like yeah especially when you start
calling things that are just never
recall it's it's usually alerts the

[02:16]
recall it's it's usually alerts the
alarm but like if you call if you call a
frequency hand more often than like the
other person's like well there's
probably Frequency Car if you call it
always it's very hard to figure out
obviously over the long term your
frequencies can be a bit out of line but
if you start calling [ __ ] that's just
never a thing the other person's like oh

[02:30]
never a thing the other person's like oh
interesting yeah yeah yeah I was just
like
and I think yeah as well like I would
just like have like a decently strong
hand and then like you know if a good
player put me all in I wouldn't even
like really think I'd just be like I
have to call this guy and then like you

[02:46]
have to call this guy and then like you
know later realize oh this hand is
actually like you know it's a strong
hand but like he's rapping stronger this
hand is a mix but like I would just have
like Snapped the call button because I
just like ah he has Bluffs like you know
and it's like well I'm not really giving
him much incentive to find the Bluffs

[03:00]
him much incentive to find the Bluffs
like you know you know it's it's it's
exactly also what you were talking about
with Adam as well in terms of what is
the deciding factor especially
we always Focus so much on on Theory and
in theory everything is very close so

[03:15]
in theory everything is very close so
the side effect I think I think that's
also to come back to what Adam asked me
like for example overriding blockers on
blockers especially in sportswear where
just have infinite combos to work with
like obviously in the solver it's very
important but in real life if you play
against the nits or someone who's very

[03:31]
against the nits or someone who's very
aggressive or over aggressive that's a
way more deciding factor in terms of
what we should consider if you have the
information and you play against someone
who's in it yeah I don't care which
blocker you have or which Unblocker you
have it's probably something not very

[03:45]
have it's probably something not very
useful to think about I think um
yeah I think I think anyone studying
blockers before 5K is kind of wasting
their time
I think it's just
like they're so like they're so
unintuitive

[04:01]
unintuitive
they're like so many times I hear
um I hear people from like mid-stakes
talk about their blockers and and
they're just doing the opposite thing to
what they think they are because it's
like there's just so much you know
there's like so much going on with all

[04:15]
there's like so much going on with all
of these like tiny effects
um which like all like add up and like
this is the kind of thing which I was
like getting lost in
um and like trying to like perfectly
account for all this stuff
um
and and like I think yeah it clearly has
a place

[04:31]
a place
um
but it's also it's like
I I I I think like there are so yeah
there are just so many people I've heard
who who like spend all their time like
digging into the blockers in one like
insanely specific River spot and it's

[04:45]
insanely specific River spot and it's
just like
well like it it's a much bigger strap
mistake
to like to like not have to like have
like no Bluffs or like way too many
Bluffs than it is to like pick the
slightly wrong combos

[05:01]
slightly wrong combos
um so like if you can identify like a
bunch of reasonable Combos and then like
sort of like you know it like even if
you don't like have an exploitative read
but you can go okay all these combos are
reasonable I can probably go with it
like about this much from all of them
and then just like you know be fearless

[05:17]
and then just like you know be fearless
and adjust later rather than trying to
wait like work out the perfect one and
just be like okay like this is the one I
go and then like you'll be gaming for a
second and you miss it and then suddenly
like and then suddenly you're a net
because like you missed you missed this
like this like specific blocker combo

[05:32]
like this like specific blocker combo
which was supposed to do something else
and then it's like okay well
you know now for this session I've just
been less aggressive than that I should
be I saw like Phil golf on talking about
this thing where it's like
the way he rated his sessions was like

[05:45]
the way he rated his sessions was like
um you know what like one of them was
like how accurately he was playing but
also it's just like how much he was
like the power I think he talked about
which is like going for spots like you
know going for spots fearlessly and like
not worrying like you know like playing

[06:02]
not worrying like you know like playing
playing in a way which he knew was like
making Evie without being like overly
apparently about the outcome and stuff
like that is like way more important um
to like keep up your aggression to a
proper level and like force people to
bait you off and like force be like you

[06:15]
bait you off and like force be like you
know and win pots than it is to like you
know get some magical blocker play like
completely correct yeah and also in your
decision making process let's say for
example you look at spots like and you
end up like this is usually what happens
to me like okay this seems very close

[06:30]
to me like okay this seems very close
and that's when it's already closed then
suddenly like smaller things can start
to take place like yeah okay this this
hand is maybe not ideal but you arrived
that by first thinking about other
variables and then you arrive to the
conclusion okay it's very close and it's

[06:46]
conclusion okay it's very close and it's
very close then we could maybe see like
okay well I have this block I have that
blocker maybe there's an impact or you
know or playing a limp bot or a four bad
pods makes a big difference there are
going to be spots where like
blockers are like really important like

[07:00]
blockers are like really important like
especially as as ranges get tighter
um
but but it's also like you know if you
if you mess up the blockers that you're
bluffing with even in these spots where
there are like really good preferred
blockers but it's like but you still
have like a good overall aggression

[07:16]
have like a good overall aggression
level like your the amount of like Max
CV that your Strat is losing is still
pretty small
um yeah compare compared to just uh
compared to just being like you know in
pursuit of perfection but just ending up
too tight because like the solver will

[07:31]
too tight because like the solver will
always do things which are which are
like too hard to find I think like
they're they're just always like these
little bits of aggression where it's
like oh you missed like you know five
percent here five percent there and it's
like okay well there's this one you know
really obvious combo which we rolled

[07:45]
really obvious combo which we rolled
like a perfect like 35 with it's like be
your your strategy is still passive you
know you you because uh yeah because you
haven't picked up on these all these
little bears
okay
you already mentioned uh coaching a bit
who in your career has had a very big

[08:02]
who in your career has had a very big
impact on your current success and what
do you recall being one of the most
important lessons that this person has
taught you
oh well um
definitely uh Yuri let's give a shout

[08:16]
definitely uh Yuri let's give a shout
out yeah a lot amongst like
other guys are gorilla like Bart's been
uh bought like grind Corps has been
amazing as well
um
that's the most important
um

[08:30]
um
yeah I think I think the most important
thing was honestly just like hearing on
repeat until I believe that the high
stakes players are humans too
um and just like having yeah and just
like having the confidence to yeah to go
out there and like try and work out what

[08:45]
out there and like try and work out what
is actually going wrong
um in their Strat and it's like you
don't have to you know you don't have I
didn't have to do it necessarily for
everyone off the bat like I don't have
to sit down and then like you know like
the first time I'm playing 5K and trying
like own duty but like there are plenty
of guys who are like in a similar spot
to me and like don't just respect them

[09:01]
to me and like don't just respect them
because of
in terms of
like strategy
um
so it just Springs to mind is like
learning from
um
learning from like Barack

[09:16]
learning from like Barack
um
just how important like
how important your execution of your
Strate is over just your knowledge of
your Strat
um he plays like what is Baseline like
quite a simple
like a simple strategy to like

[09:30]
like a simple strategy to like
understand like what's going on and like
what what the ranges are but then his
execution within that Strat is
so insanely High
um and so yeah that was kind of the
thing which got me
you know got me a bit more uh like

[09:45]
you know got me a bit more uh like
yeah a bit more focused away away from
like the weeds of things
um and like and like it was more yeah
it's more more about like like picking
up like all the info that I possibly
could
yeah and this is kind of a a trap that

[10:00]
yeah and this is kind of a a trap that
you can fall in when trying to get
inspired Maybe by how other people play
one day you're like oh now I need to
play like stay from the other day and
we're like no I need to play more like
Barrick we had uh we had Matt I love
Avril lavignon uh a previous podcast uh
and he was also way more in in terms of

[10:16]
and he was also way more in in terms of
the simplified camp and like I said I
think also earlier
you will see successful players do
completely different things okay like in
the end it's going to be the execution
of your strategy that's going to
determine DV executed correctly you have
high V executed poorly you have poor EV

[10:31]
high V executed poorly you have poor EV
regardless of the strategy yeah yeah I
think um
yeah I mean like there's even
those guys who have like
like they smashed me heads up and I was

[10:45]
like
really confused until like I noticed
like eventually after being down so many
buy-ins because I I was like really
confused because his strategy did not
seem like
that you know like like that insane like
he was clearly making Theory errors but

[11:00]
he was clearly making Theory errors but
I was like really struggling and it's
like you know it's what I was saying
earlier about like always being in the
tank and like you know you're just all
like always feels like there's pressure
on like you're you're just not winning
very many parts
um I just realized like after a while

[11:15]
um I just realized like after a while
um after recording a session I was just
like oh he's he's a timing tell god
um like this guy has like this guy is
spending so little mental RAM on
I mean like like oh don't get me wrong
like this guy's still playing like fine
but like I was just like I was like how

[11:30]
but like I was just like I was like how
am I losing to a guy who's like you know
he's making an easy mistake here and
he'd be a mistake there uh and then he's
just like completely like smashing me on
timing towels which is like I only
realized like after I'd lost like a
bunch of money to him
um I was just like okay okay I need to
you know I mean I need to pay attention
against this guy like he's just owning

[11:46]
against this guy like he's just owning
me like he's owning me so hard in this
like in this area where
you know it's like it's like you sort of
project how you think about Pokemon to
other people it's just like oh why like
you know I'm thinking of it as like you
know a chess game and trying to
complicate the position and then he's

[12:01]
complicate the position and then he's
doing that thing of like he's going
straight to something which just
supersedes everything else where it's
just like oh I took some like weird
timing which allows him to hand read me
down to like very specific range and
then he can make a very accurate
decision against that range which is why
I was always in like constantly in these

[12:16]
I was always in like constantly in these
tough spots and like
one of the things which is always like
scary if you're playing someone heads up
is when you have a combination of
um you know you are seeing some huge
plus from them but you're also getting

[12:30]
plus from them but you're also getting
like value tricks where they're like
massively over playing hands and then
they're also like giving up some pure
Bluffs in other spots where it would
have looked in buying and you had the
hand
um and like you have like all this going
on and it's like it feels like the guys

[12:45]
on and it's like it feels like the guys
inside your head yeah yeah especially
when you when you when you when you call
light in the spot where he went in and
then you were like okay now I'm this is
the spot I'm going to call him and then
he gives up it's like um yeah yeah I
mean I I had like there was one like

[13:01]
mean I I had like there was one like
really specific animal I didn't even
like I hadn't even made a hand but I was
just like so sure I was calling down and
like the guy like Snap gave up like a
pure follow through and I was just like
I just felt like I was like wait how am
I like how was he like how has he done

[13:15]
I like how was he like how has he done
this because it like he felt like uh
like the rest of them actually being
like super super aggro and I was like
wait how is he like how's he not gone
with his hand like um and then I yeah
and that was the kind of thing which
made me get like really paranoid and
start like recording this actually and
going over afterwards and I was like oh
like okay I guess I was just like I was

[13:33]
like okay I guess I was just like I was
just making all my obvious decisions
within like one second and then like you
know tanking when I actually had one I
was like okay like maybe I need to maybe
I need to be a bit more like respectful
of that area of the game like just

[13:45]
of that area of the game like just
because I haven't worked on it doesn't
mean it's not a way that someone can
generate a win rate yeah it's an
interesting point you guys obviously
let's say you evaluate someone's level
you evaluated Through The Eyes that
you're evaluating a bit like oh I look
at this look at this game theoretically
he makes this a lot of mistakes but

[14:00]
he makes this a lot of mistakes but
let's say he's still a big winning
player well there's more most probably
there's indeed an area like for example
what you mentioned with timing tells
that you don't really evaluate in terms
of when evaluating how good a player is
but if he's still winning and to you
terms of like he's a good player he's

[14:15]
terms of like he's a good player he's
actually not a good player then what's
going on probably something to learn
there
