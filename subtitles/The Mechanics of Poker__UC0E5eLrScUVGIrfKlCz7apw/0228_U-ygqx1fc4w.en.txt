[00:00]
poker is one aspect of your life uh and
it's obviously one that you want to
optimize and do do good at but yeah the
rest of your life is also important it's
going to influence how how much time and
energy you're going to be able to put
into poker some point you just accept
that you're you're bigger than your your

[00:16]
that you're you're bigger than your your
poker identity and uh those other areas
they influence it today we will be
chatting with high Sixx entity player
and serial entrepreneur Peter Arts
because you do a lot of things right you
your your entrepreneur I saw keep note

[00:30]
your your entrepreneur I saw keep note
speaker you you are the CEO and you have
a cono of a company uh you have a kid
and another kid on the way you're also
High poker player it's like how Peter
has been playing poker for over 17 years
has two Triton trophies and has won

[00:45]
has two Triton trophies and has won
numerous big events online I hated the
fact that you couldn't really get a
clear answer to how you played a hand if
you made a mistake or not and then you
would talk to friends and some of them
would have a different opinion than you
but you you were still not convinced who

[01:00]
but you you were still not convinced who
who should I trust myself should I trust
my my peers that were commenting on the
hand investing versus growing your bankr
my girlfriend she she's actually trying
to educate people on uh these types of
financial decisions and and the most

[01:15]
financial decisions and and the most
important one is yeah not leaving your
your your money basically uninvested
yeah there are basically eight Arch
types in terms of financial personality
the primary one for me and probably the
one that most poker players are going to

[01:30]
one that most poker players are going to
have is like the rebel when you lose
money it's related to oh I I just lost a
piece of my safety or a piece of my
piece of my certainty where indeed where
where you said it I see it as like
bullets munition you know we need we as
poker blades we have money we need to
shoot I think if I would see a

[01:46]
shoot I think if I would see a
meaningful way for these types of
Technologies now to improve poker or to
integrate with poker I I might be the
one building those type of uh of uh
applications I like it you have a team
of Na

Ado guys enjoy this episode Peter when I
uh looked you up on hand the mop I saw a
very impressive 5.6 million life
earnings including two Triton titles but

[02:47]
earnings including two Triton titles but
what actually caught my eye is this
let's say baby version of Peter with a
big smile on his face having presumably
just won his first ever live event uh
how old were you when you started and

[03:01]
how old were you when you started and
What attracted you to the
game so I started playing poker when I
was about to turn 17 years old um I
actually had to use my dad's ID to sign
up for a for poker website um I started

[03:16]
up for a for poker website um I started
through a a training site called poker
strategy which was quite big uh back in
the day I started uh with $50 starting
Capital that they provided for free and
they gave you a I would say a course or

[03:30]
they gave you a I would say a course or
like a very basic strategy they call it
the short stack strategy where you
bought into tables for 20 big lines um
and this was kind of in the the climate
of those days we're talking U 2008 was

[03:45]
of those days we're talking U 2008 was
kind of a proven way to to build up a
bank roll like if you just play
tight uh and just played good hands and
you try to get the money in the Middle
with those good hands you were almost
certainly uh to become a winning player
and to kind of build your bankroll if

[04:01]
and to kind of build your bankroll if
you follow that exact same
strategy um especially with how rake
worked back in the day where you just
had to be dealt into a hand to receive
uh part of the rake back this was a
really very profitable strategy and the

[04:16]
really very profitable strategy and the
whole business model of that Focus the
training set was also to get as many uh
profitable players that could just
survive and generate rake uh because
they were receiving a cut of course um
so that's kind of how I got started uh

[04:30]
so that's kind of how I got started uh
but you had to do an ID check back in
the day and and you had to be 18 and and
actually needed my dad had to convince
my dad for a couple of days give me this
this opportunity um in the end he did
and uh this this was kind of how how I

[04:45]
and uh this this was kind of how how I
got started but this yeah was 2008 the
picture that you were mentioning was
taken at EPT uh Paris I think 2012 yeah
must be 2012 or 2013 somewhere somewhere
over there and it's a it's a heads up

[05:00]
over there and it's a it's a heads up
tournament that I won uh so between 2008
and 2013 somewhere IED to heads up uh
cash games uh and I was very fortunate
to to have this uh live win experience
of of a heads up tournament at at the EP

[05:16]
of of a heads up tournament at at the EP
which I don't believe they're still
still doing but they used to have those
32 men 1K heads up uh and yeah was able
to come out on top which was a great
feeling of course especially at that
young age and coming for a life
tournament probably one of my first uh

[05:32]
tournament probably one of my first uh
times playing live so yeah that was
really really a memory I I treasure a
lot yeah you looked you look like a
happy little boy uh on the picture that
that's literally the first thing that
stood out to me besides all like I said

[05:46]
stood out to me besides all like I said
all your impressive uh impressive
results you mentioned uh you started
playing like this cash game short St
style poker strategy then you mentioned
transition to heads up nowadays you're
an MTT player what made you transition

[06:00]
an MTT player what made you transition
to
MTT well I've always been somewhat
fascinated by by mtts I used to play
them already I I so I would say starting
2019 I took mtts really really serious
uh started to play higher buying as well

[06:17]
uh started to play higher buying as well
uh start to study more uh and really try
to compete with um the best players at
the time starting 2019 but before that I
was already playing a little bit on the
side could like on Sundays because a lot

[06:31]
side could like on Sundays because a lot
of my Belgian friends they were
primarily MTT players so I kind of got
sucked into it through them and of
course uh there's something magic about
mtts like running deep getting getting a
big score that that's always a different

[06:45]
big score that that's always a different
type of experience than just grinding
cash and and seeing the the buyin kind
of accumulate into your account sure but
uh entities they were Al always
something uh exciting to me uh I was
actually losing uh a lot uh on them in
like 2016 17 18 eventually managed to

[07:03]
like 2016 17 18 eventually managed to
get third in like a w Coupe um to to
kind of get break even um but but but
then yeah 2019 mtts kind of uh went

[07:15]
then yeah 2019 mtts kind of uh went
really well with like a sixth place in
uh in scoop Main Event fourth place in
in W coup uh main kind of back toback
that kind of launched my I would say MTT
career uh then covid hit and the there
was nothing to do and and yeah GG came

[07:33]
was nothing to do and and yeah GG came
up as a poker site and uh that kind of
got got everything in like uh yeah
faster faster movement uh in in terms of

[07:45]
mtts how did you uh how did you keep
going and what did you have to fix
throughout the years I think you
mentioned 2016 2018 you're not the most
profitable MTT player how did you
continue through that rough patch why
didn't you quit and what did you have to

[08:00]
didn't you quit and what did you have to
do to to fix your game to actually
become an profit MTT player yeah I think
um a lot of my mistakes that I was
making at the time they were probably
because I was primarily a heads up cash
game player which is somewhat maybe the

[08:15]
game player which is somewhat maybe the
the the furthest away that you can be
from from like an MP
player um you're always in like heads up
cash you're always uh doing big range
well wide ranges against wide ranges um
there's usually you can call a lot wider

[08:32]
there's usually you can call a lot wider
on the river because the the other guys
range is has a lot more air or or junk
in it and in mtts it's just really not
the case some boards when when a certain
range that's already very narrow on

[08:45]
range that's already very narrow on
certain board just doesn't have uh a lot
of Bluffs or or people are not uh
correctly playing in a certain way and I
just wasn't adjusted to this type of
environment where a utg range is a lot
different than then a cutoff range or

[09:00]
different than then a cutoff range or
the big line defending range is is
completely different from from a lowjack
opening range is a lot of big
differences and and uh for textures um
that one range hits very well the other
doesn't and those type of Dynamics were

[09:16]
doesn't and those type of Dynamics were
really unknown to me at the time and I I
probably played two tag from the big
blind as well a bunch of those mistakes
that I'm sure a lot of people were also
making at the time um but still this
this heads a ground and maybe being too

[09:30]
this heads a ground and maybe being too
much of a calling station on the river
and maybe yeah just showing up with to
weak of a range sometimes or not being
too aware of of the strength of the
opponent's range or of my own range and
really exploiting that I think those
mistakes kind of uh led to me not

[09:46]
mistakes kind of uh led to me not
performing that well I also think I just
didn't uh really ran very good because
this is also an important Factory in
mtts I also saw this with a couple of my
friends at the time they didn't really
have uh the successes that other people

[10:00]
have uh the successes that other people
were having and looking back on it I I
definitely wouldn't say that me or my
friends were that much worse than some
people having a big score but yeah it
just didn't really materialize and uh I
think just variance is like it's I'm

[10:16]
think just variance is like it's I'm
sure it's been discussed a hundred times
on this this podcast in any poker format
it's just uh a really big thing and um
yeah realizing that and and and uh well
adjusting to that but just accepting
that is is a big part of a a

[10:31]
that is is a big part of a a
professional's
Journey um but I'm yeah I'm glad I I was
able to turn it around uh eventually and
and become break even and then become a
winning player um and maybe even
experience a very positive side of

[10:45]
experience a very positive side of
variant uh the last few
years what made you like throughout that
period where things were not going to
way what made you continue because I can
imagine if you change formats and let's
say you lose you lose an MTT for a year

[11:00]
say you lose you lose an MTT for a year
you're like well that's probably not my
format and it's very easy to just you
know look at the lobby like oh you know
there's head UPS in goes of well there's
cash games make sure I should play this
what made you stick to the mtts were you
like consciously like look at okay this
is literally this is really just the

[11:16]
is literally this is really just the
most profitable form of Poker right now
has the most longevity what kind of went
into that yeah so at the time I don't
think it was necessarily the most
profitable form of Poker there weren't
that many high stage tournaments uh well
whereas now can really um yeah play very

[11:31]
whereas now can really um yeah play very
high stakes which obviously have a
percentage return on investment it just
becomes a bigger uh profitable
opportunity than then back in the day I
remember the Sunday 500 on Stars being
like the the biggest ntity uh of the

[11:46]
like the the biggest ntity uh of the
week um I think so definitely not uh
wasn't clear that it was going to be the
most profitable form of Poker um I think
what kept me going was just also this

[12:00]
what kept me going was just also this
uh wanting to perform or wanting to
achieve something and just wanting to
have the feeling or kind of get this
monkey off my shoulder where um I didn't
want to leave it um as if I wasn't good
at it or if I was failing at it I kind
of just wanted to prove for myself that

[12:16]
of just wanted to prove for myself that
I was able to do it or that I was able
to come out of on top I think that was
also a part of it and definitely then
the longevity of mtts is is of course in
terms of Poker ecology is a lot better
than than cims you see already many Test

[12:30]
than than cims you see already many Test
games uh becoming more private and just
um for recreation there is not not a
great format to keep on playing they
just lose too quick too quickly I would
say and the variance is not high enough
usually um for them and mpts kind of

[12:46]
usually um for them and mpts kind of
really uh have this perfect sweet spot
of uh allowing uh a recreational player
to have an amazing experience winning a
tournament um and and getting all the
feelings and and the money that comes
with that

[13:00]
with that
um and and and you kind of see this in
in the most successful tournament Series
right now it's just a nice mix of of uh
poker enthusiasts everyone loves poker
there um but yeah I think this is the

[13:15]
there um but yeah I think this is the
format with the most longevity wasn't
necessarily back in the day but just
really wanted uh to prove that I could
win or that I could perform
well so you not necessar because like
some people have mixed motivations right

[13:30]
some people have mixed motivations right
that we spoke to on this podcast so you
were not necessarily sitting there
calculating what's the highest hourly
and you were not doing it purely for the
money but from what I'm hearing of you
you saw like losing in mtts not as a
sign that you were not good at it so you
should switch but you saw it as a

[13:45]
should switch but you saw it as a
challenge like oh you're saying I canot
beat these MTT so is like this this
competitive Drive is this a big part of
you're longevity in poker because like
you've been playing poker now for 16 17
years you know it's it's a very long
time if you're just in it for the money

[14:02]
time if you're just in it for the money
uh you know and you don't have a big
love for the game I can imagine it would
be uh easy to quit by now but is is that
like that competitiveness nature is that
something that keeps you in
poker for sure I think challengeing

[14:15]
poker for sure I think challengeing
competitiveness is a big factor why I I
still play and why I um play in the
games that I'm currently playing in um I
definitely was first drawn to Poker
because of the moneymaking aspect the
ability to sit behind your computer play
a game

[14:30]
a game
I was already playing uh games for fun
at the time so so having something where
you could actually earn money was was of
course great but I think over time
especially when I started playing inps
it became really more about wanting to
yeah be able to compete being being part

[14:46]
yeah be able to compete being being part
of of the scene it sounds uh it sounds
worse than it is I I would say but just
really wanting uh wanting to achieve
something to perform uh and I remember
at the time I wasn't really thinking

[15:00]
at the time I wasn't really thinking
about uh Roi or uh even being profitable
or EV that much I I just wanted to
improve uh because I was I was seeing
mistakes I was improving myself was
seeing mistakes in others and I kind of
logically reasoned that uh I should be a

[15:16]
logically reasoned that uh I should be a
winning player and kind of wanted to to
prove this to myself but the only way to
do that is kind of to keep on playing
until you have some good results and for
still looking back now uh that did end
up happening so so yeah great for

[15:31]
many uh I feel like people can have a
different sort of response when faced
with tougher opposition like people
might get insecure or shy away
especially you know things then don't
really go their way they're like wow
these guys are probably better to

[15:45]
these guys are probably better to
me then there's the other side that
people almost thrive on this pressure we
had Mario mbak on a couple podcasts ago
and he said if you put the lights on
Final Table big money that's where I
thrive you know that that's like I get
in the zone because I need kind of this
the certain pressure how is it for you

[16:01]
the certain pressure how is it for you
like when you face tough tough
opposition what kind of what kind of
triggers what does that trigger inside
of
you yeah good question um so when I was
primarily playing heads up cash games
for example I used to be more avoiding

[16:16]
for example I used to be more avoiding
of uh good players thinking more about
uh time spent profitability is it worth
to take these big Varian against a good
regular player I was much more aware of
this and I would say I kind of avoided

[16:30]
this and I would say I kind of avoided
uh playing good players uh a lot also
because it wasn't really necessary just
um felt like there were there were
better things to do better games to play
but in nbts of course you don't have
this choice you you uh you get put at a
a table with they certain table draw you

[16:46]
a table with they certain table draw you
have good players some some some worse
players than them
um and I really like uh yeah competing
against uh those good players um looking
at at what they're doing maybe trying to

[17:01]
at at what they're doing maybe trying to
learn from them but also then seeing
people that were having really good
results for example that that had just
won Sunday million or a big tournament
and then they were making clear mistakes
and this kind of gave me this empowered
me because uh I was seeing their

[17:15]
me because uh I was seeing their
mistakes I was not making them uh and
even with all those mistakes they were
able to have these types of results and
that kind of motivated me a lot um kind
of lifting the ve a bit over their poker

[17:31]
of lifting the ve a bit over their poker
like pulling away the curtain over their
own poker success and seeing that hey uh
the way they're achieving these types of
scores isn't necessarily perfect uh and
and I can maybe be be better than them
or or make less mistakes than them and

[17:46]
or or make less mistakes than them and
and have the same results and I think
that's
um that realization definitely motivated
me to to to keep improving to keep
playing um and in terms of of feeling
pressure and um yeah I think most of the

[18:02]
pressure and um yeah I think most of the
online games that I'm currently playing
have a lot of very good players in them
um I really enjoy playing those games
and I'm kind of already more used to
them when I go on to a live uh poker uh

[18:16]
them when I go on to a live uh poker uh
stop there's uh the mix of players is a
lot different uh but even then in in the
high binds you you face all those uh
very strong players and it's kind of
what I'm used to and
um yeah what I really like and and I

[18:30]
um yeah what I really like and and I
don't shy away from anymore which I I
did in the past I would say when playing
a different format but now it's it's
just become part of what poker is for
me you've been in poker uh 16 years I'm
curious like because you you've you I

[18:46]
curious like because you you've you I
think M started 2008 like poker has has
changed a lot right so how is the let's
say sort of the job subscription of what
you needed to be a professional poker
player how has that changed over these
16 years that that you've in

[19:00]
16 years that that you've in
poker yeah I think if we look at the 16
year period one of the the biggest
changes for me personally was the Advent
of of GTO solvers uh they really uh
changed the game uh from more of a yeah

[19:16]
changed the game uh from more of a yeah
intuitive and feeling game to a much
more technical uh game and this is
actually what benefited me a lot I think
I was always uh very
I I hated the fact that you couldn't

[19:30]
I I hated the fact that you couldn't
really get a clear answer to how you
played a hand if you made a mistake or
not and then you would talk to friends
and some of them would have a different
opinion than you but you you were still
not convinced although maybe they were
more experienced players and you always

[19:45]
more experienced players and you always
had these mixed uh mixed signals like
who who should I trust myself should I
trust my my peers that were commenting
on the hand uh and so so the Advent of
solers really gave me a lot of give me
some new tools to play with and to

[20:01]
some new tools to play with and to
discover um yeah more the science I
would say behind poker
uh and and and so so that was key for me
uh the ability to to learn from a source
that I would trust I would say uh I also

[20:16]
that I would trust I would say uh I also
bought some courses in in 19 2019 2020
from I remember Nick petrangelo course
uh for
example um which helped me a lot just
because he was a very
[Music]
he was a player that had achieved a lot

[20:31]
he was a player that had achieved a lot
uh uh back then he was playing very high
stakes and this was finally someone that
I would be able to trust uh if he was
saying something on a video I would pay
pay attention whereas lot a lot of other
training sites you weren't really always

[20:46]
training sites you weren't really always
sure um if this is the best information
that you're receiving or the most
accurate or the most
relevant um and that course was also
about how to how to use a solver uh and
and can kind of BU build further on that

[21:00]
and can kind of BU build further on that
and I think that changed the landscape a
lot and just that games got got tougher
people start to play in a certain way
well there are still variations in
playing style but I think it's uh
although there are people in in mpts

[21:16]
although there are people in in mpts
mostly live that that still win without
uh studying the solver I I think it's
it's almost mandatory that you you work
in in uh in this way uh and it changed
poker the poker climate a lot another

[21:30]
poker the poker climate a lot another
big event would of course be Black
Friday where the US kind of got shut off
and games also got Duffer um but yeah I
I've been around for quite a long time I
still have a lot of uh memories about
things that happened Scandal or people

[21:46]
things that happened Scandal or people
and and all that stuff and it's nice to
have that type of of History uh with me
I really appreciate um the the poker
scene uh and everything that that comes
uh with it

[22:00]
uh with it
um yeah it's nice to look back uh on
such a long time of playing a game I I
still love to this
day what kind of advantages do you think
this back of experience of 16 years
gives you compared to like some of the

[22:16]
gives you compared to like some of the
newer newer school kids you know that
maybe only have been playing for three
years but you know they they
straightaway learned poker let's say
quote quote the right way right because
as a fellow old school player we have a
lot of unlearning to do do as well uh on

[22:30]
lot of unlearning to do do as well uh on
top of just learning the the correct
ways what kind of advantages do you
think you have compared to like some of
the new kits on the Block s to
say yes that's a good question um I I
also I used to uh think that um people

[22:47]
also I used to uh think that um people
kind of would uh improve faster than
they're they're currently improving
maybe or that a lot more players would
be coming up because you have have these
solvers you can can have put infinite
time into to studying a solver we have

[23:02]
time into to studying a solver we have
tools now that you can play against the
server so it's really a very nice way of
of learning and improving and and I
would have guessed that and that's
something I've I've been uh doubting for
the past years like if you're not

[23:16]
the past years like if you're not
studying enough or not cons consequently
improving uh you're you people are going
to kind of move past you you're not
going to be profitable anymore all that
stuff but I feel like it it's not really
or or in some way I've been able to to

[23:31]
or or in some way I've been able to to
maintain an edge uh despite maybe
spending less time in the past year year
or two uh with solvers just because of
um some kind of yeah Street poker uh
thinking that kind of Dev developed

[23:45]
thinking that kind of Dev developed
while I was playing heads up um because
you have
to uh be able to think and and also be
in spots where you may not know the game
tree too well through study and and and
I think in some way I I I just uh been

[24:01]
I think in some way I I I just uh been
able to to do well in those make good
decisions um while I'm sure that that
there are people upand cominging players
of course if you you you haven't been
playing for for for a long time then
improving and studying is going to be
more um more Focus uh I would say um but

[24:21]
more um more Focus uh I would say um but
yeah it's not all about putting time and
work in with solvers it's also about
experience about um maybe developing
good mental framework of course uh so I

[24:32]
good mental framework of course uh so I
think indeed this this bag of experience
like you say um it's helping me more
than I realize
sometimes Adam what kind of uh
advantages would you say that usually

[24:45]
advantages would you say that usually
these uh these old school players have
what's kind of your take on
it yeah I think as said it's often
experience a lot of intangibles a lot of
Street poker as he mentions and I guess
come from a heads up background as well
you played a lot of spots a lot of flops

[25:00]
you played a lot of spots a lot of flops
post flop and yeah I think experience is
very hard to quantify 17 years just
think of all the the hand scenarios
opponent types problem solving you've
done and you put a someone a solver yes
they're going to have a lot of good
outputs but the experience I think

[25:15]
outputs but the experience I think
you've gained is going to be very hard
to catch up so I think experience in
everything there's an element where it's
an advantage you know obviously youth is
also an advantage like the youth have
that kind of that drive that ambition
they're like spending eight hours in a
solver you're spending one youve got
that experience Gap so yeah it's always
a a kind of cutand house game and I'm

[25:31]
a a kind of cutand house game and I'm
definitely don't know the answer in
terms of which one comes out on top but
it does seem that experience can often
hold off talent for quite a while so
yeah it's interesting to observe yeah
I'm really curious for this conversation
to take a little bit in a different
direction and going a little bit into
money management building a bank roll

[25:46]
money management building a bank roll
and the reason for that is obviously
you're playing the tritons right now
which is the Pinnacle of high stakes
poker you have a company that focused on
digital asset growth and your wife's an
author of the financial book and
financial coach so so many Avenues to
pull on and I feel like every poker

[26:01]
pull on and I feel like every poker
player to some degree is trying to grow
their bankroll for various reasons and
having different success rates with that
Journey so first of all I'd like to talk
about your journey of building your bank
RW you mentioned as an 18-year-old kid
you started with this approach to kind
of win increase your bank roll quite

[26:16]
of win increase your bank roll quite
quickly and yeah talk about how you
initially built your bank roll what was
some of the kind of trial and error
approaches you had as you were initially
starting out on building your bank
role yeah um interesting uh so I already
mentioned the the $50 free $50 plus $100

[26:33]
mentioned the the $50 free $50 plus $100
bonus that you had to kind of clear that
was uh the model back in the day uh with
a short sex strategy I was able to build
like a TH or $2,000 bank roll off of
that kind of transition to those heads

[26:46]
that kind of transition to those heads
up cash games um I remember going to
University to study I just turned 18 in
September of that year uh I started with
about $2 or
$3,000 um and and by January I had

[27:00]
$3,000 um and and by January I had
$30,000 all from playing heads up I was
playing 2 4 36
510 and then uh while I was having exams
I was still playing poker uh a bit on
the side and then in two weeks I kind of

[27:15]
the side and then in two weeks I kind of
just uh lost lost everything uh I guess
kind of uh destroyed the bankroll I was
uh building over over those four
months um and one of uh my good friends
still to this day uh who was playing uh

[27:30]
still to this day uh who was playing uh
much higher Stakes than me uh fixed
limit hold them actually uh he kind of
gave me a stake that I was able to win
like 10 or $15,000 playing heads up um
was about I was able to keep like half

[27:45]
was about I was able to keep like half
of that and and that kind of got got me
on my feet again there was definitely
also this period uh then where where I
wasn't playing too much uh maybe six
months of of not playing poker too
actively uh I'm glad I can kind of
picked

[28:00]
picked
up where I left up at some point um and
then yeah I was playing mostly on uh
well on all the the the sides that kind
of had heads up uh cash game tables uh
for many for many years uh there was

[28:16]
for many for many years uh there was
this concept of
uh well they called it bum hunting back
in the day um all people would call it
the game
selecting um as I was saying I didn't
really see the value uh back then
because I was also studying and and

[28:31]
because I was also studying and and
having other things on my mind uh in in
trying to compete with people that were
only focused on poker um and I was
mostly trying to to to make money and
and build a bank role or I kind of try

[28:45]
and build a bank role or I kind of try
to secure some form of uh Financial uh
security or some Financial basis to
build on maybe later
um and then in 200
19 when those npts became more seriously

[29:01]
19 when those npts became more seriously
I I think I kind of got quite lucky in
uh in final tabling scoop and and W coup
final tables that that are obviously
like a big bankr boost um allowed me to
play higher entities higher average

[29:16]
play higher entities higher average
buying uh then had some really big
successes in the summer of
2022 we had like uh 2.5 million in
Cashes in in in 10 days or something
both on and live but that kind

[29:30]
both on and live but that kind
of yeah you you build it up over quite a
long time and you just keep going and
keep uh progressing and there are
obviously downfalls where you fall back
a little bit but you just get have to
keep going to try to

[29:45]
keep going to try to
persevere um in terms of yeah playing
now tritons uh definitely don't have uh
have all my action always um once you're
you have this uh reputation of being uh
profitable player you're able to sell at

[30:00]
profitable player you're able to sell at
at at markup percentages where it's it's
a good way to reduce variance to kind of
lock in some profits
to uh and I've been enjoing that a lot
and um we'll see uh how how that
continues in the

[30:15]
continues in the
future what would you say have been some
of the biggest Financial lessons you've
learned you mentioned building your Ro
to 30k and then losing that very quickly
I'm guessing that was a bit too
aggressive with bankroll management now
overconfidence game selection yeah what

[30:30]
overconfidence game selection yeah what
have been some of the lessons most
notable lessons you've had to learn as
you've built your bank roll over
time yeah exactly kind of what you what
you mentioned you make those mistakes
I've always been someone who um even if
I get good advice it's kind of goes we

[30:47]
I get good advice it's kind of goes we
have a saying here in Belgium goes into
one year and then outside of the other
so it kind of doesn't really stick um I
kind of have to hit my head into a wall
and then kind of recover from from the
blow uh I would say and this is how I

[31:01]
blow uh I would say and this is how I
learn this is how I stop making mistakes
in the future um I think it's a natural
way of learning sometimes maybe I would
like uh to kind of have the the prence
to not uh make those mistakes in the

[31:17]
to not uh make those mistakes in the
first place but it is what it is
um yeah in terms of money management you
also have to have a bit of confidence
and faith in yourself that even if uh
something turns sour or it doesn't go
well or you hit uh a down swing which

[31:33]
well or you hit uh a down swing which
I've also been uh through uh on many on
quite a few occasions that it'll you're
always going to be able to turn it
around and the answer is uh just keep
keep going and maybe uh focus on
improving your game because that's

[31:46]
improving your game because that's
actually a thing you can control you
can't really control the outcome of a
chance experiment which which poker is
um yeah just uh look within yourself and
and and keep going and don't doubt and

[32:01]
and and keep going and don't doubt and
and don't stop
yeah how do you think about what should
be the priority of BR grono bankr I say
this from the context of some players
want security so they want to have like
that kind of Nest Egg to uh feel
comfortable so they can maybe buy a

[32:15]
comfortable so they can maybe buy a
house settle down or create some sort of
financial buffer other players kind of
want to grow a bank roll just to play
higher just for the opportunity to uh
seek new games there's kind of a balance
between those two one create a bit of a
comfort to being able to seek
opportunities especially in the poker

[32:30]
opportunities especially in the poker
realm as you've kind of grown your B
bank roll have have you thought about
those two differences and how have you
kind of prioritized either more security
growing your bankr net worth or seeking
more
opportunities yeah it's a very good uh
question I think it also what factors

[32:47]
question I think it also what factors
into these types of decision a lot is
just your uh your situation in life if
for example I start out 18 19 20 years
old uh you kind of can take a lot more
Financial Risk then for example I'm
right now 33 I have a child second one

[33:01]
right now 33 I have a child second one
on the way this is where um if you're
now risking money that you really need
uh to kind of keep your family going uh
in a good way that's that's probably a
lot of a pressure that a poker player

[33:15]
lot of a pressure that a poker player
shouldn't really have so then maybe you
you have to seek out a different
strategy or be a lot more
conservative um so I was fortunate to
start poker uh playing without too much
financial troubles or pressure um I was

[33:30]
financial troubles or pressure um I was
also just studying I had uh a small uh
dorm I guess which which my my my
parents were paying for um so I didn't
really have that much expenses
everything um that I had from poker

[33:45]
everything um that I had from poker
income I could kind of uh use on things
uh as I wanted to um so there's
definitely that decision do you want to
consume what you win or do you want to
save it up for your bank roll
um and I think currently uh looking at

[34:02]
um and I think currently uh looking at
the the current climate of of Poker you
have a lot of high stakes action but
then you also have a lot of uh players
that are playing maybe $500 or or 1K
buying uh online that are really uh good

[34:16]
buying uh online that are really uh good
and high quality players that maybe want
to make the jump um to higher Stakes
online or um or or those big life
tournaments of course you already see
some of them making that that move and
the the fact that you can sell

[34:30]
the the fact that you can sell
action uh or or get a stake or or be
backed by by good players also playing
those games is is a solution for many
but I think there's a lot of value in
getting to to a bankroll where you can
uh have a good piece uh in in good games

[34:45]
uh have a good piece uh in in good games
uh and and most of the best games I
would say in terms of Roi are
currently uh yeah the High Roller life
uh poker
tournaments uh and being able to to have
a good piece of yourself in those ones
is is kind of important so if you're

[35:01]
is is kind of important so if you're
able to kind of uh get to that that
level there's a lot of value in that
because the skill gap between maybe
players playing in those tournaments and
uh players competing in in online games
I don't think it's necessarily that that

[35:15]
I don't think it's necessarily that that
big so it's it's mostly about how how is
big is your bankle and are you able to
to play those games and that makes a big
difference I think in in hourly uh
returns picked up on there one was the
bankroll management approach overall and

[35:31]
bankroll management approach overall and
just not being Reckless of your bankroll
we can touch more that later low and
financial pressure you mentioned you
never had much Financial pressure but it
sounds like it's a a key variable to be
able to make good financial decisions
and then have a good piece of yourself
in good games and progressing towards a

[35:45]
in good games and progressing towards a
situation where that's kind of true for
you now culy know like a lot of players
who kind of struggle to build their
bankr I know myself like the first three
years I would make money and spend it
and just a mindset issue around just
being young Reckless and not really
thinking too far ahead and thinking that

[36:00]
thinking too far ahead and thinking that
money was always available it wasn't
until like the third year of okay I've
still got nothing in my bank account
after another year of grinding that the
frustration started to build and I
started go how do I start to build a
bank roll whilst making money so I'm
curious enough for you when you went for
that transition I'm sure there's a point

[36:16]
that transition I'm sure there's a point
where you started to acquire a lot more
money than you were spending how do you
think you players can break through that
b bit of a reckless fears where they're
not really thinking too far ahead of of
what opportunities are available
yeah um I think I was just fortunate

[36:31]
yeah um I think I was just fortunate
also back in the day there was just it
was just a lot easier there was a lot
more money to be made especially in the
heads up games those if you compare it
to now I think the volume of HED up gas
games must be like almost a tent of what

[36:45]
games must be like almost a tent of what
was going on in 2011 2012 for
example um and there was just it was a
lot easier to just build make three four
5K dollars a month and kind of uh over
shoot your expenses and I think that's a

[37:01]
shoot your expenses and I think that's a
lot more difficult uh in today's climate
if you're just playing mtts you also
have this this variance um coming into
it and then when you have a big score
you kind of have to uh probably recover
some losses and and make sure you don't

[37:16]
some losses and and make sure you don't
start going on a spending spee because
um yeah those big scores kind of make up
for for longer periods of of draw
down it's definitely tough if
if your income or your EV from poker is

[37:30]
if your income or your EV from poker is
close to your expenses and you're not
really able to to build a bank roll um
yeah that stuff I I think it just been
fortunate to to overshoot that Target uh
quite fast and then not have too many
monthly expenses myself and definitely a

[37:46]
monthly expenses myself and definitely a
drive to to play higher games always
that was that was certainly there
because especially now speaking more
from the heads up
background um the ability to sit at at
higher Stakes uh and and to catch uh a

[38:02]
higher Stakes uh and and to catch uh a
big whale sometimes uh was huge of
course because the game was the same the
level of the opponent usually was the
same as well it was just about more
money so uh I can of did prioritize uh
trying to play as high as my bank roll

[38:18]
trying to play as high as my bank roll
was able to let me get away with and
probably got quite lucky during some
periods where I might have been quite
aggressive on bankroll management that
that there wasn't a big
big draw down from

[38:30]
big draw down from
these yeah I'm curious know what your
thoughts are on aggressive shot taken in
bankr management compared to
conservative approaches and it sounds
like for you you like the aggressive
approach especially because you had low
living costs but also felt you could
rebuild I think think a lot of players

[38:45]
rebuild I think think a lot of players
almost like way too long they maybe
don't work out the compounded effects as
you mentioned of playing these higher
games maybe have a mindset issue around
they're not quite ready not quite good
enough or they just have some sort of
limitation around how much money they
need to keep at all times to to make
feel comfortable so for you know what

[39:02]
feel comfortable so for you know what
you think about the kind of pros and
cons of being aggressive with your bankr
let's say you're quite young mid 20s
your living cost are somewhat reasonable
and you have some games you can play
where you can make it somewhat
predictable win rate do you feel these

[39:15]
predictable win rate do you feel these
players should be aggressive with their
bank roll management presuming that they
have the ambition to play high stakes
one
day I would say probably not um it was
different for me back in the day because
uh the EV of just playing in a in a

[39:31]
uh the EV of just playing in a in a
higher buying format was was just a lot
higher and I I don't think that's the
case currently uh if you're playing for
example $50 average buying
tournaments um those are going to be
softer than a $100 average uh when you

[39:46]
softer than a $100 average uh when you
play a schedule like that so it kind of
progressively becomes uh more difficult
whereas in my situation it was just a
bigger game for more money but the game
wasn't more difficult so it made a lot
of sense to be more aggressive being

[40:00]
of sense to be more aggressive being
able to capture that opportunity as well
so um the strategy is just a lot of
difference uh if if it isn't really a
higher EV format that you're able uh to
play um maybe for example for online

[40:15]
play um maybe for example for online
players um taking shots at live entities
could be a good example of where maybe
they try to get a lot higher piece of
themselves than they would when they're
playing online or or they really try to
actively seek out those opportunities

[40:31]
actively seek out those opportunities
because for example big Main Events
where you have like a lot of binds up
top that they can really be a
Kickstarter from many people's poker
career so giving yourself that
opportunity um I think that's probably

[40:46]
opportunity um I think that's probably
uh the way to do it kind of uh grind
together kind of uh a b that you can
then take higher risk with in in high EV
Games such as life tournaments although
there's going to be a big part variant

[41:01]
there's going to be a big part variant
involved uh which you do have the
stomach I think that would be one of
those areas where maybe people can take
more aggressive shots but uh for online
games speaking for mtts I don't think
really the the risk reward is there to

[41:15]
really the the risk reward is there to
play higher games where it's just going
to be tougher for you to win uh and
maybe a different situation comes up
where if you're playing in games that
have a high rake and maybe you can move
up to where the rake is a smaller
percentage of uh of the buying or of the

[41:31]
percentage of uh of the buying or of the
blind I think this comes up more in cash
games than in mtts that could be a good
reason to to move up in Stakes I guess
uh but it really all depends on is your
EV a lot higher in those uh those games
and if not it doesn't really make sense

[41:46]
and if not it doesn't really make sense
uh to move up I think yeah I think I
think actually in cash games it's it's
inde need a little bit different as well
because you can shut take a good game
let's say for example you play an
average toel But You observe like the
500 games and sometimes you can get like

[42:00]
500 games and sometimes you can get like
the nut seat on a will yeah your Audi is
going to be way higher regardless you
know like your seat selection or the
seat that you have to position on the
recreational in cash games is just going
to have such a big impact on your win
rate you know so I think in cash I
usually always give the advice that like

[42:17]
usually always give the advice that like
okay there's certain Port where you
should maybe Reserve like five buy to
take shots in amazing games you know
yeah I think that's a great suggestion
and and like you mentioned in cash there
are these types of opportunities where a

[42:30]
are these types of opportunities where a
higher game is a much higher EV and it
can make sense to take those shots I
there's thinking mtts it's maybe okay
there's some kind of special MTT maybe
you could save up some buying for for
like uh a main event during a big series

[42:46]
like uh a main event during a big series
like uh in September or in May there's
usually big series and there you maybe
uh take a shot in one of the main events
I think that's also a very reasonable uh
approach to take but just
starting to play higher um in in normal

[43:01]
starting to play higher um in in normal
games in npts it doesn't make that much
sense to me but yeah cash games those
big Main Events maybe Big Life Main
Events those are where I think you
should be uh trying to estimate your EV
and maybe take a more aggressive

[43:17]
and maybe take a more aggressive
shot yeah picking your spots a bit more
wisely and calculate it there I want to
talk about investing versus growing your
bankr and I know yourself you managed
digital assets so you obviously know a

[43:31]
digital assets so you obviously know a
lot about this space and I think a lot
of poker players are simultaneously
trying to set themselves up for the
future whilst also having dreams of
building their bankr to play high stakes
and I think a lot of players I know
myself I was in this category you think

[43:45]
myself I was in this category you think
you'll get to a financial goal where you
kind of set up for the future and then
you'll start thinking about investing
stuff from there and in the meantime
everything's just grow the bankr so I
can play higher and yeah I'm curious to
what your thoughts are on that mindset
I'm sure a lot of players fall into this
category of I just want to build my bank

[44:00]
category of I just want to build my bank
roll and I'll think about how to manage
my money as I get filled in the line
when do you think that switching points
are where players should start to uh
maybe educate themselves on what to do
with their money as they're claiming the
financial
letter yeah that is indeed interesting
now first of all I don't think you need

[44:16]
now first of all I don't think you need
to keep 100% of your bank role in cash
always you could always uh buy for 25%
of your bank will maybe buy buy stocks
with it for example or something else
sure um because you don't need that
liquidity to play uh it just needs to be

[44:32]
liquidity to play uh it just needs to be
there in they you lose a lot that you
can kind of fall back on it maybe sell
the the other assets uh hopefully not at
a loss um but the EV of having those
assets is higher than than having cash

[44:45]
assets is higher than than having cash
um but then in terms of uh it just
becomes a um I guess a calculation
between what what's the best for me uh
if I increase my bank rle play those
higher games how does that that
increased my profitability my hourly my

[45:00]
increased my profitability my hourly my
EV um compared to not being able to
higher games uh and want them to keep
things uh
invested um but I don't think your bank
roll should be 100% cash I think you can
be and i' I've usually been kind of

[45:15]
be and i' I've usually been kind of
fluid with this concept of of bankroll
because some people have a very Set uh
idea of bank this is what I do for poker
and then I have some money that I don't
touch for poker under no circumstances
whereas I've usually uh well for the

[45:32]
whereas I've usually uh well for the
majority of my bker playing career have
operated under the assumption that my
network is my bankroll basically um and
especially when you're starting out
that's going to be the case especially
when you're 18 19 year old you're going

[45:45]
when you're 18 19 year old you're going
to take risk like that if you of course
have a family or have other obligations
or you need money from more important
stuff than than playing poker then of
course that that does change uh
um yeah I think it's very personal I

[46:00]
um yeah I think it's very personal I
think it also comes with how high your
risk tolerance is but definitely of
because for example my girlfriend she
she's actually trying to educate people
on uh these types of financial decisions
and and the most important one is yeah

[46:17]
and and the most important one is yeah
not leaving your your your money
basically uninvested uh and kind of
always uh find some place where that
that money can can compound and become
become
bigger um it it's probably should be uh

[46:32]
bigger um it it's probably should be uh
thought in in in schools even so and
certainly a poker player is going to
kind of need this type of information or
get familiar with yeah how to manage
money even outside just the poker game

[46:47]
money even outside just the poker game
uh to kind of achieve the best uh
success I would say even for your bankle
right if if you're putting 25% in I I'm
saying like uh American S&P tracker uh

[47:02]
saying like uh American S&P tracker uh
which makes 10% a year or over the the
course of four or five years that
already improves your bank role as well
compared to when you just leave it in
cash on on on the poker side it's not
earning
anything

[47:15]
anything
um but yeah I would definitely say it's
it's important and it can the two can
kind of complement each other uh you can
use poker winnings to invest or you can
uh the
increased uh gains from investing to

[47:31]
increased uh gains from investing to
kind of uh bolster your your bank roll
and and kind of uh make this this number
when you add everything up bigger and
and be able to make decisions of that
bigger number so from from what I'm
hearing you say you're mainly talking

[47:45]
hearing you say you're mainly talking
about digital assets here right because
I can imagine let's say for example I
take half of my bank or put it in a
house or something it's a bit more or
that house still has to be built you
know and then if I suddenly need it it's
not easily accessible So when you say
like you're complete net worth but to

[48:02]
like you're complete net worth but to
have like that part of your bank that's
basically only if you go in like 5%
worse runs or something you mention
stocks that's a bit easier right
tomorrow I can just sell my stocks have
that money liquid take can put it into
the games again right so I guess there

[48:15]
the games again right so I guess there
is a little bit of a distinction there
that we have to make yeah yeah of course
I I was talking about liquid assets like
stocks digital assets um in theory you
could buy even a gold bar and and sell
that again and uh if if things uh come
really bad I think a house as well

[48:34]
really bad I think a house as well
um you could always sell it I guess
worst case uh that's not fun um but I
would kind of
still yeah I've never been really in

[48:46]
still yeah I've never been really in
this situation where if I buy a house
this is still part of my bank role I
guess you can kind of debate whatever it
is um but I think for a lot of people
it's going to be easier to kind of
disregard it and and put it as like a
loss Resort safety net

[49:04]
loss Resort safety net
um yeah I think yeah liquidity and asset
is of course very important if you're g
to g to make him part of your bank rle
and indeed like you say digital assets
are the the most liquid and the most uh

[49:17]
are the the most liquid and the most uh
easy types of assets to sell or to move
um because yeah I mean not I I'm not
sure uh how it is in other countries but
uh funds from from poker websites Banks

[49:31]
uh funds from from poker websites Banks
aren't always that that happy to kind of
see it and if you're constantly moving
between your broker and poker websites
it's just a lot of traffic and can give
you a big headache as well so it it does
have some advantages to just pay digital

[49:46]
have some advantages to just pay digital
I guess uh
completely it feels like from what you
said that that most players would need
their own personalized financial plan
just based on then them bank roll what
games they're playing what their goals

[50:00]
games they're playing what their goals
are how much kind of variance they have
in the games they're playing I'm curious
to know have you got any resources or
anywhere you'd recommend for some
players to educate thems themselves
because I know a lot of Po players may
have their heading their sand so to
speak I know your wife's got a book on
this topic so any resources that you
recommend for players who are like

[50:15]
recommend for players who are like
actually I know nothing about my
financial opportunities I have all my
money sitting in E wallets or in cash
I'd love to uh make some better
decisions on my own bank CW
um i' I've never really had this type of
formal uh plan I'm not really that

[50:31]
formal uh plan I'm not really that
organized I would say uh in I mean I
have some ideas in my head around these
things um but it's not very structured
or very formal uh I I wouldn't say I
really have uh many resources to

[50:46]
really have uh many resources to
recommend to people um so my my
girlfriend she indeed um educates people
about these types of Concepts but it's
mostly in Dutch which is a of course
minority of people listening will be be
able to understand that but I'm sure if

[51:01]
able to understand that but I'm sure if
people start uh Googling or asking chat
GPT or or finding good YouTube channels
around this stuff they will be able to
to find good
content um but yeah it's very important

[51:15]
content um but yeah it's very important
and the earlier you start um investing
and start compounding your Capital uh
the better it gets and and it's really a
lifelong journey uh that a lot of more
people uh should be doing because it's
really the difference

[51:30]
really the difference
between um especially in 30 40 50 years
The Compound Effect is is huge and uh
it's really the difference between uh a
lot of money and just uh normal amount
of
money

[51:46]
money
uh yeah I don't think people need to
need to uh go go that crazy or or I
think for most people they don't need to
start uh stock pick
or uh or especially not day trading or

[52:00]
or uh or especially not day trading or
leverage trading they should just uh
invest in in trackers um S&P tracker or
an ETF that encompasses World index of
of companies something easy like that is
already doing doing a lot uh long term

[52:19]
already doing doing a lot uh long term
for sure yeah I think it's really
important to think about and as you
mentioned like right right now you might
be loving poker and just in it for the
progression but in 10 15 years time your

[52:30]
progression but in 10 15 years time your
efforts put into the game you want some
rewards for that you want to be
financially set up for the future so if
you want to stop playing poker take a
break whatever you're in a great
situation and that doesn't happen just
by keep making money and not thinking
about it you've got to be thoughtful for

[52:45]
about it you've got to be thoughtful for
a long period of time with financial
decisions so yeah I think it's
definitely a good topic yes I've
actually used trbt for this purpose I
gave it the job of a financial my
financial advisor I put in all my my
details my assets and what my goals were
and it's actually quite good it's giving

[53:00]
and it's actually quite good it's giving
you at least a ballpark direction of how
you should be thinking about asset
managements what sort of options you
have available based on your kind of
risk profile and it opens up a thought
process of H what should I be doing in
this situation with my current finances

[53:15]
this situation with my current finances
I think even if you don't get it's not
about getting perfect it's more about
making small decisions to move you
towards the financial opportunities you
want in the future and realizing as a
pocket player you actually need to think
a lot about this compared to a normal
person most people have a job they have
a salary they have a pension scheme with

[53:31]
a salary they have a pension scheme with
their work it's kind of figured out a
little bit for you maybe not the optimal
way whereas as a poget player hopefully
you're building up more and more of a
net worth year on year it's now what are
you going to do with that to allocate
that in the right way and as you
mentioned 15 years 20 years of good
compounding decisions is going to put

[53:45]
compounding decisions is going to put
you in a very different situation
compared to you not putting thought into
it I think it's good to start even when
you've not got much money so you're
already prepared I'm curious to know for
you what keeps you in poker obviously
you've done a well out of pocket you've
been very successful even recent Triton

[54:00]
been very successful even recent Triton
stops you've kind of tick tick ticked a
lot of boxes is it just the enjoyment of
the game or what keeps you competitive
and want to keep
playing yeah good good question um I've
actually when I had that big success end
of
2022 uh I I won a big online tournament

[54:17]
2022 uh I I won a big online tournament
had like an online bracelet um won a Kon
tournament which was a big achievement
for me finally uh it was actually the
first live final table I reached and
then I immediately was able to win it
which is huge of course uh and and I

[54:31]
which is huge of course uh and and I
kind of uh felt relieved of a lot of
pressure uh when that period uh passed
and and actually in my mind I was kind
of done with poker
for I didn't think forever of course but
kind of uh semi-retired from the game I

[54:48]
kind of uh semi-retired from the game I
would say and then nine months later I
listen actually to mechanics of Poker
podcast with yans Arians who who's
become a good friend of mine uh since
then and kind of got motivated again to

[55:00]
then and kind of got motivated again to
to start playing uh and just really uh
enjoyed it again and so it's definitely
just a love and passion for the game um
also the competitive nature Still Still
does a lot for

[55:15]
does a lot for
me um and I also think the the ability
to play this live poker tournaments uh
and travel to some nice destinations uh
uh meet interesting and fun people uh
seeing them a couple of times a year

[55:31]
seeing them a couple of times a year
developing relationship with some of
them is is also a really nice component
of uh of the type of Poker life I've
been uh blessed to be able to to to lead
uh so so I actually have had these

[55:45]
uh so so I actually have had these
periods where I've been less motivated
uh less sure about my future as a poker
player um it's it's mostly right now
these these big online series that
really motivate me to play where there
where I can really kind of focus myself

[56:00]
where I can really kind of focus myself
for like six weeks on on playing online
three four days a week um and then these
live live stops where you're all also
just completely focused on on playing
poker and uh you can structure your life
around that uh in those moments um and I

[56:18]
around that uh in those moments um and I
think for me that's that's going to be
it uh for the future the near future um
and I don't feel feel much much pressure
to to constantly grind or

[56:30]
to to constantly grind or
to um never miss a Sunday or that kind
of stuff it's just um I play when I feel
like it I play I I usually want to play
When the the games are good or the the
buying is good or the the price pool is

[56:45]
buying is good or the the price pool is
high that kind of
stuff uh and and of yeah that's that's
really a an ideal scenario to be in to
really just enjoy the game while also so
feeling like um in every field I play I

[57:01]
feeling like um in every field I play I
I'm I'm doing reasonably well uh or at
least not losing losing a lot maybe some
very uh small online game maybe if you
haven't played for four or five months
and you dive into a very rck heavy uh um

[57:17]
and you dive into a very rck heavy uh um
MTT maybe maybe you're losing but in
most live games definitely going to be
going to be fine and and that's probably
going to remain iess for for quite a
long period so uh this is this is how

[57:30]
long period so uh this is this is how
I'm seeing it right now this is when I'm
most motivated when I'm at my B and uh
yeah sometimes there are stretches where
I I play a bit less and that's
completely
fine feels like the enjoyment of
competition is still very strong and

[57:46]
competition is still very strong and
you're a point now as you mentioned
where you hav nothing to proove you're
doing it for your own enjoyments and now
you're playing these big Liv stops which
are enjoyable in thems and you're still
enjoying being competitive in that Arena
which is great we talked a lot about
your successes and you rising up for the

[58:00]
your successes and you rising up for the
stakes I'm curious to know what was
being a rock bottom moment or like a
hard pot of your career I know you
mentioned Ren You' kind of had a few
patches where you struggled to make
money mtts what would you class as the
most challenging part of your career and
how did you navigate that

[58:15]
how did you navigate that
period yeah so definitely the first time
I kind of blew up my bank roll was uh
was kind of a bad moment needing help
from outside um of course it's already
been quite a long time ago uh and I
think uh just yeah the the playing mpts

[58:32]
think uh just yeah the the playing mpts
in
1718 um I think there was another period
um I'm not sure exactly when but
somewhere in the five years when when I
went to quite a big downswing six nine
months of not really getting getting

[58:45]
months of not really getting getting
much done especially live for example I
think I didn't really have any success
until um the Triton win in 2020 too I
never really I got never I got like 20

[59:00]
never really I got never I got like 20
in in an EP uh once um I played a lot
kind of a lot of WSOP Main Events also
throughout those 16 uh years and never
really had had a big success big score
and and that was
definitely uh I mean it's not like one

[59:17]
definitely uh I mean it's not like one
big moment I guess but it's it it was
like a feeling of of yeah failure I I
don't want it's maybe a bit too strong
of a word but just not getting this the
results that you

[59:30]
results that you
wanted um so that was like an insecurity
uh for a while and and yeah something
that I I kind of needed to prove to
myself uh hey it's not going to be in
insecurity anymore I'm going to change
that weakness of myself into into a

[59:47]
that weakness of myself into into a
strength I love that your first answer
was nothing really and then it was like
16 years without a big live score and I
think because you've got such a long
longterm perspective you've been in
progress so long you've kind of L like
progressed like slowly in your own minds

[1:00:01]
progressed like slowly in your own minds
to like the next levels buzzing patches
of six months here 12 months there long
extensive 16 years live where you
haven't had the results that you would
wanted I'm curious to know for you how
does that impacted you mentioned this
little bit insecurity maybe a chip on

[1:00:15]
little bit insecurity maybe a chip on
your shoulder have you used that as like
a fuel to drive yourself to be more
competitive to study harder how has that
generally impacted you and what's life
like now when you haven't got that
insecurity or anything to
prove yeah I think for sure when when

[1:00:30]
prove yeah I think for sure when when
I'm running that or when I'm not sure
I'm beating the games or I'm not getting
the results that's when I kind of am
most motivated to change that
situation uh so being on a A downswing

[1:00:45]
situation uh so being on a A downswing
or starting my MPT career on on a big
downwing I would say is kind of has been
a blessing in the end because it kind of
made me uh yeah go harder at it work
harder than than I would have if I would
have just Bing something immediately and
probably I probably would

[1:01:01]
probably I probably would
have would have lost it or or wouldn't
have been uh that serious about it
because it be came too easy now it was
very hard for me to to have certain type
of success
[Music]
um uh so so yeah that's been good I also

[1:01:18]
um uh so so yeah that's been good I also
think um once I have a big big score for
example a couple of months ago I I had
another big track win and it it just the
pressure kind of leaves you a little bit

[1:01:30]
pressure kind of leaves you a little bit
you're kind of building up to this
moment trying to
get get that result and once you have it
like kind of yeah Le leaves your body
it's kind of off your mind you're kind
of satisfied for a while again and I'm
sure I'm going to get that thrive in the

[1:01:46]
sure I'm going to get that thrive in the
future again once it's been a in a a
series of of kns getting maybe scores or
not playing that much um but it's
definitely been having bad results is
actually has been good for my game and
and motivates me a lot more than than

[1:02:01]
and motivates me a lot more than than
having a good score because that that's
kind of the the cherry on top of of the
long
journey uh and after that I sometimes
fall into this this spirits of okay it's
been good I've had uh um I've had this

[1:02:15]
been good I've had uh um I've had this
moment uh I've achieved what I wanted to
achieve let's see let's see what's next
let's see what where life takes me also
sometimes I might have like prioritized
poker during those rough patches or or
moments that you're still trying to to

[1:02:30]
moments that you're still trying to to
get somewhere um and maybe then there
are some other uh areas of your life
that need some attention or where it's
maybe a good idea to
focus yeah I think that's a good point
to touch on when you have a big goal
that you're striving towards and you

[1:02:45]
that you're striving towards and you
finally achieve it it's like an Olympic
Athlete winning the gold medal or in
your case when the big Triton stuff is
the equivalence all of a sudden you're
going to go into a bit of a low like do
me is going to drop you're going to feel
a little bit like H what do I pursue
next I think that's uh not always the
easiest place to navigate but sounds

[1:03:01]
easiest place to navigate but sounds
like for you you're quite used to these
kind of cycles of okay I'm not currently
pursuing a major poker goal but I know
it come back give me a few months or how
long it takes and the next thing will
appear so I think it's a a good cycle to
uh to be mindful of especially anyone

[1:03:16]
uh to be mindful of especially anyone
who plans to achieve big goals when you
get there there will be some little low
as you come back to to Baseline U so a
good thing to touch on there you
mentioned earlier on the conversation
you've developed good mental Frameworks
I think this was in the context of
experienced players having advantage

[1:03:31]
experienced players having advantage
over new school players what are some
good mental Frameworks you've
developed I think these these things
just come over time you really can't uh
can force it it's it kind of comes
through experience

[1:03:45]
through experience
to going on a down swing coming out of
that down swing seeing seeing that
period as okay that was necessary for me
to get to this point it's uh it's it's
all part of it like the the variance in
poker is there I have somewhat of a

[1:04:01]
poker is there I have somewhat of a
mathematical background as well so
really understanding how the law of
large numbers works and how chance
experiments work and understanding EV
understanding variants um in in that

[1:04:15]
understanding variants um in in that
regard probably has helped me uh and
just kind of being insensitive to to
financial loss to to to busting from
from a tournament of course it's easy to
say but you have to

[1:04:30]
say but you have to
really kind of feel pain maybe thousand
times until the the Thousand first time
you don't feel feel anything anymore or
just gets a bit less over
time um yeah I would say the most
important part is just kind of try to

[1:04:47]
important part is just kind of try to
focus on making good decisions um and
making sure that that you do whatever it
takes to keep making those good
decisions or you keep Improv moving your
decision making process that's the only
thing you really can control so focus on

[1:05:00]
thing you really can control so focus on
that and the rest should should flow
quite
naturally yeah I think it's important as
you mentioned how long some takes to
learn lessons and experience often is
needed so you've got a degree in
computer science you're very good with

[1:05:15]
computer science you're very good with
numbers I'm sure intellectually a lot of
the large number Stuff variance stuff
you're very familiar with and it's just
normal probabilities but until you
experience it enough times it's a very
different thing to intellectually
understand something you need to go
through down swings it's like one of
those things where the numbers make

[1:05:31]
those things where the numbers make
sense but the experience is a lot more
painful so for you it sounds like you've
been quite patient with yourself during
these processes have I got that right or
have you went through a lot of um mental
pain as you've experienced these swings
throughout your
career I guess so uh I don't think um

[1:05:49]
career I guess so uh I don't think um
poker has really affected me a lot in a
negative way in terms of being less
happy because I wasn't performing at
poker or or that kind of stuff uh maybe

[1:06:02]
poker or or that kind of stuff uh maybe
a little bit sometimes but I don't think
it really had a very strong impact
mostly use it as as kind of a fuel to to
drive me stronger and further uh from

[1:06:15]
drive me stronger and further uh from
that point
on
um I mean maybe it's also personality I
I'm not sure uh I think I've seen other
people will certainly struggle a lot
harder uh or um yeah friends that I used

[1:06:31]
harder uh or um yeah friends that I used
to play with that are not currently
playing poker
anymore um kind of had to leave it
behind because they were not getting the
results that they wanted um so I've kind
of observed this in other people and
I've kind of been blessed to not have

[1:06:45]
I've kind of been blessed to not have
to um experience this feeling of of
maybe uh not being good enough or or not
getting there uh myself
sounds like you're able to use a lot of
these experiences as fuel even the

[1:07:00]
these experiences as fuel even the
negative ones to work harder to be more
motivated more competitive more driven
where other people maybe struggle to
always direct that energy towards uh
progress or improving Rene for you which
lessons have you had to learn the

[1:07:15]
lessons have you had to learn the
hardware through experience rather than
being able to
intellectualize h i mean there's so many
lessons been over over over all these
years
uh I would say you know what's

[1:07:30]
uh I would say you know what's
interesting sometimes you think you
learn the lesson and then you know at
some point it comes back and then you
you realize it maybe like a month in or
two months in like [ __ ] how i' I thought
I've kned this especially when when we

[1:07:45]
I've kned this especially when when we
talk about mental game stuff mindset
stuff you know it's very easy to
suddenly you know fall into all patterns
again I guess the only difference is
that and that's kind of the process that
you make that you recognize it sooner
like in the past you recognize it 3
months in now you recognize it two
months in one month in but I feel like

[1:08:00]
months in one month in but I feel like
you're constantly trying to recalibrate
yourself to to stay on the right path
and I guess that's kind of the the skill
that you develop it's it's in my
experience it's almost impossible to
prevent right you're going to have times
where you show up on your C game or it's

[1:08:16]
where you show up on your C game or it's
just recalibrating sooner I think that's
also if I could contribute something to
experience and like the value that gives
that gives me is like you know yourself
a bit better right have more
self-awareness you've bring through more
things so you spot it and your course
correct sooner I would say that's the

[1:08:32]
correct sooner I would say that's the
main advantage that I think my
experience has over like new kids that
still have to kind of learn themselves
right how do you show up how do you feel
you start to recognize oh I'm feeling I
feel I'm feel like I'm not in the right

[1:08:45]
feel I'm feel like I'm not in the right
state to play well for example that's
something that you have to experience
multiple times to recognize that feeding
um so especially I think learn a hard
way how to deal de with feelings I would
say deal with emotions around the game
you know I've went to phases where I try

[1:09:01]
you know I've went to phases where I try
to completely block it off or you know
keep it all in then I went to face where
I would just let it all out you know and
then I act experience with with with
multiple things uh so I guess the main
and still the hardest lesson to learn up
until today is yeah learning learning

[1:09:16]
until today is yeah learning learning
how to deal with your your emotions I
would say around around poker and all
the things that come up I you're you're
nodding your head quite a lot Peter you
sounds familiar
yeah I definitely agree um yeah keeping
keeping uh your tilt under control or

[1:09:32]
keeping uh your tilt under control or
kind of dealing with disappointment I
guess in npts is the very very common uh
also I think making mistakes uh letting
yourself make mistakes not letting a
mistake influence you after it happened

[1:09:46]
mistake influence you after it happened
and kind of really be okay with this and
accepting that it's part of of
everyone's game basically that you make
mistakes and
of course you try to Minimate minimize
the amount of mistakes and the severity

[1:10:00]
the amount of mistakes and the severity
of those mistakes but that's kind of all
you can do you you can't really avoid
them uh completely um and don't give
yourself too much of a hard time over
them um because that's always what
actually um has angered me well if anger

[1:10:16]
actually um has angered me well if anger
is again a strong word but uh something
that has frustrated me is when I make a
clear mistake and I real realize it
after afterwards um it's it's a lot
worse for me than than busting a
tournament or losing a flip even in an

[1:10:32]
tournament or losing a flip even in an
important spot it's like okay I wasn't
able to influence that at all but this
one hand I played or this decision I
made this River decision this call this
it's usually a river call

[1:10:46]
it's usually a river call
uh yeah I could have play that better or
or I shouldn't have gone into that spot
shouldn't have lost those
chips those types of I
I had to kind of experience that a
couple of times before you really also

[1:11:00]
couple of times before you really also
become insensitive to that so it's again
more focused on what you're able to
control yourself and if you you make
mistakes there um yeah that's always
been more frustrating than just the
outcome of a flip or or a tournament or

[1:11:18]
outcome of a flip or or a tournament or
or or a cooler or whatever because yeah
you you quickly learn that those can be
controlled anyway so focusing energy and
time on that is is really kind of a

[1:11:30]
time on that is is really kind of a
waste yeah I can I can relate I
think the most difficult thing I have
trouble with is indeed disappointment
disappointment of my own performance
disappointment of you know that I just
played the session like [ __ ] I can do so

[1:11:45]
played the session like [ __ ] I can do so
much better like why like why did this
just happen you know it's like the
frustration uh like yeah it's the
knowing you can do better but it does
doesn't come out and I'm I'm curious
actually also wanted to tap in I think
this this relates nicely uh so if I talk

[1:12:02]
this this relates nicely uh so if I talk
for myself I also don't play poker as
frequent as I used in the past because I
do other things right we we record this
pod I make I make content I have
coaching I have family so there's
multiple things going on where to back

[1:12:15]
multiple things going on where to back
in the past it was just like poker 247
my whole life was around poker my
routines were around performing the best
I can you know at the tables how have
you
found it to I guess I should rephrase

[1:12:30]
found it to I guess I should rephrase
like how do you manage your time and
remain efficient because you do a lot of
things right your you're your
entrepreneur as all keynote speaker you
you are the CEO you have a Koo of a
company uh you have a kid and another
kid on the way you're also High six

[1:12:45]
kid on the way you're also High six
poker player it's like how like do you
do you sometimes to tap into also the
frustration and KN you could do better
do you something also have poker session
where like [ __ ] if I would just focus on
poker I could play so much

[1:13:00]
better well maybe that that could be the
case I I do remember uh when we we just
had the first child um she was born in
August and you had a big poker series
starting end of August and in September
and uh I I did play quite a lot even

[1:13:16]
and uh I I did play quite a lot even
during that period I was fortunate to
have my girlfriend uh support me in that
uh but I wasn't always uh um I didn't
always have the right amount of sleep I
would say so sometimes yeah you're
you're going to uh I think sleep is

[1:13:32]
you're going to uh I think sleep is
quite important for performance as you
probably both know uh and and not having
the the right amount of sleep um and
also something like that is you just
have to accept that maybe your
performance is going to be worse because
of your life situation you know and it's

[1:13:47]
of your life situation you know and it's
poker is one aspect of your life uh and
it's obviously one that you you want to
do uh you want to optim and do to good
at but yeah the rest of your life is
also important it's going to influence

[1:14:00]
also important it's going to influence
how how much time and energy you're
going to be able to put into poker so um
at some point you just accept that
you're you're bigger than your your
poker identity and uh those other areas
they influence it and and you do try to
fight some form of of balance and for me

[1:14:16]
fight some form of of balance and for me
it works the best when I have this
stretch of a couple of weeks where I can
kind of direct Focus to Poker a lot uh
um and and really be able to perform and
put that first and then after that
period is passed again then then I can

[1:14:31]
period is passed again then then I can
put uh put other things um more
primarily uh for my time um in terms of
yeah I I I do have a couple of projects
couple of companies that that I'm active

[1:14:45]
couple of companies that that I'm active
in um I think most fortunate for me
there has been the ability to kind of uh
delegate tasks uh put competent people
into important position positions where
for me the need to be there
operationally or to to execute and the

[1:15:02]
operationally or to to execute and the
key executing figure is not there and
it's mostly about making decisions or
having the right decision or um
understanding the market that we're
operating in very well and knowing where

[1:15:15]
operating in very well and knowing where
we need to go and then articulating that
Vision towards the people that that are
working with me I think that that has
been uh the way that I've been operating
and I've been blessed that um those
people uh that are working with me are
fine that that that that's the way uh it

[1:15:31]
fine that that that that's the way uh it
works
um yeah it's definitely sometimes a
challenge to to kind of keep everything
uh running smoothly and I do feel like
hey if I would be only playing poker of

[1:15:46]
hey if I would be only playing poker of
hey if I would only focusing uh on my uh
my businesses that yeah maybe those
would perform better of things would go
faster
or but that's that's going to be be a
thing I I'm I'm just uh not

[1:16:03]
thing I I'm I'm just uh not
really good at forcing myself uh to pay
attention in a certain direction I want
to do a couple of things um and even if
that means that that I can't do those

[1:16:17]
that means that that I can't do those
things as good of or as efficient as as
a person that is only 100 100% devoted
to that one single thing
uh then that's just going to be how how
it is uh it's it's either you do one

[1:16:30]
it is uh it's it's either you do one
thing very well or if you have the
ambition to to do a couple of things to
to because
you you want success in pooker but you
also want to build successful company
well yeah you're going to have to make
some compromises in both fields for that

[1:16:46]
some compromises in both fields for that
um and I try to not do that with with
the family of course I think that's
really what I'm trying to put first um
so so yeah it it's it's a big mix but I
do enjoy having a lot of interests

[1:17:03]
do enjoy having a lot of interests
um and and yeah because otherwise I
think yeah I just need need different
goals in life and and different ways to
develop um different challenges to

[1:17:16]
develop um different challenges to
achieve I I think it's it's just part of
of who I
am yeah also sounds like realistic
expectations right kind of aligning line
your expectations that now that you do
multiple things you know yeah you're
going to slack maybe a certain errors

[1:17:30]
going to slack maybe a certain errors
like you said maybe uh maybe you could
have done better but you should try to
do as best as you can with the time that
you're willing to commit and it see it
seems like you have your your values
right in terms of what's really
important to you I think actually
another skill that's that just popped up

[1:17:45]
another skill that's that just popped up
in terms of what you learn along the way
is I guess be compassionate right when
you make these mistakes you know for
example you jumping into the Siri while
you had less sleep I have the same like
basically when I don't sleep well yeah
the rest the rest the the performances

[1:18:00]
the rest the rest the the performances
suck even like in a podcast like this if
if we had the podcast and my baby uh
destroyed my night sleep I feel like I
performed less and like it's really that
Still Remains the hardest strer even for
example if I have a podcast on and I
feel like I didn't I didn't really bring

[1:18:15]
feel like I didn't I didn't really bring
my AME because I was tired there's like
a sense of disappointment like I should
have done better you know you know also
for for like the guests you know a lot
of guests maybe this is their first time
ever doing a because you know I want
them to have a good experience so and I
have the same like around poker I just
want to show up as the best version of

[1:18:31]
want to show up as the best version of
myself so I think what I should work on
is again that realistic expectations
right that we have a range in how we
show up and some compassion in there
that's fine this and you trying to make
the best of the circumstances I like
what you said that you like to and I

[1:18:45]
what you said that you like to and I
think especially mtts are very very nicy
for this but I guess you could do the
same for cash that you know you you work
towards a series right and then during
the series it's poker that's what you
prioritize and then you sort of move on
I feel like that's a a nice way to
balance instead of you know for example

[1:19:02]
balance instead of you know for example
throughout the week I do a little bit of
I work a little bit on that a little bit
that littleit that then play some poker
I feel like it's a bit harder than if
you just go into the mindset of okay now
it's just poker or now it's just family
or now it's just business but even then

[1:19:15]
or now it's just business but even then
like in poker I'm curious how maybe some
people listening that also have a family
or maybe if you just have a relationship
how do you switch between I'm Peter you
know you know the the the stoic poker
player who crushes who crushes people at
the table too I turn I turn around and

[1:19:31]
the table too I turn I turn around and
I'm daddy Peter and I give my kid a
loving hug how H how do you how do you
transition between the two or any you
like for people don't have kids you give
your girlfriend a loving hug you know
and you're you're present with them
you're emotional with them which is like
in my opinion it's the complete opposite

[1:19:45]
in my opinion it's the complete opposite
of what you have to be as a poker player
how how do you
transition yeah I don't think uh with uh
my child it really it comes quite
naturally but I do think relationships
um as a poker player it's very you're

[1:20:00]
um as a poker player it's very you're
always thinking logically trying to shut
out feelings where in a relationship
it's it's also often how the other
people other person feels um and
feelings actually become quite important
in terms
of um getting along and and being happy

[1:20:17]
of um getting along and and being happy
together so that is definitely you just
have you can take a pure logical
intellectual approach to to relationship
and to a discussion in a relationship or
and you just have

[1:20:30]
and you just have
to yeah think more about about feelings
maybe this is also a man against against
women thing uh more than it is a poker
player against a non- poker player thing
but yeah there's definitely the way you

[1:20:46]
but yeah there's definitely the way you
learn to think as a poker player the the
feelings you shut out and then in social
situations it becomes more or not
everything is is is like a problem to
solve or or something where you have to

[1:21:01]
solve or or something where you have to
be very strict and
principled um you can let let things go
A bit and I think maybe it's also nice
to to be able to have that outlet in
poker where you can have that really
complex problem solving

[1:21:16]
complex problem solving
stuff whereas then with with family um
you can have more the the soft side of
yourself and and I think those kind of
things complement each other actually uh

[1:21:30]
things complement each other actually uh
I don't feel like there's a lot of
tension between the two in my life
currently well then then then you got to
figure it out for the people listening
you know I think we've if you're in a
relationship you've all heard the well
you're here but you're not really here

[1:21:45]
you're here but you're not really here
you know you still thinking about a head
that that that just screw up and I also
start laughing so that probably sounds
to him as well it's like the classic one
right and what I found uh most helpful
is that for example after I had a long
long session I I don't interact straight

[1:22:02]
long session I I don't interact straight
away with the wife I don't think that's
that's that's really good like I take I
go take my dog out for a walk or I'll go
to the gym because I feel like I have to
I have to kind of process it or for me
personally if there's really a hand that
bother me I have to kind of analyze it

[1:22:15]
bother me I have to kind of analyze it
and come to a conclusion like accept
Okay I play this bad or you know give it
give it a place before I can be present
with my wife because else I feel like
very easily triggered you know you have
a bunch of things on your mind and then
she starts to complain about something
or mention the topic that you're like

[1:22:30]
or mention the topic that you're like
sorry but my I don't really have the
head space for this right now but it
sounds like uh uh you you you have the
part uh I don't want to say figure it
out but you know it's just always a
working process and you have days that
you're better better than others
right yeah that that's true um maybe I

[1:22:47]
right yeah that that's true um maybe I
like accept accepting that we have a
range in also how we show up as a
husband boyfriend father you know yeah
for sure maybe I do should mention like
my girlfriend is a ex po well she's a
poker player herself she used to

[1:23:01]
poker player herself she used to
actually be friend of Poker Stars back
in the day when that was still a thing
um so she she understands the landscape
uh a little bit and uh she always at
night when I go to bed she asked me how
was how was what were the results but of

[1:23:16]
was how was what were the results but of
course as a MTT player he usually losing
losing losing until you have like a big
score but okay uh there's this
psychological effect of a loss having a
lot higher impact than than a win and
then of course the fact that you're

[1:23:31]
then of course the fact that you're
having a lot more losses then sometimes
that one big win uh makes it so that
yeah usually the the news for her
whether it's at night when when she
wakes up or or in the morning isn't
always that positive and I feel like it

[1:23:45]
always that positive and I feel like it
affects her a bit more than it affects
me like I'm I'm very easily able to
stomach uh losing sessions but for her
it's uh it's it's sometimes more
difficult it's also because we have a
bit of a different Financial personality
that's that's actually something that

[1:24:01]
that's that's actually something that
her second book that she just published
is about about financial personality
types um and that framework did help us
understand each other a lot more and
kind of makes sense and um once you you

[1:24:17]
kind of makes sense and um once you you
learn about yourself and your your
environment um you kind of start seeing
that things are are normal in a way um
and that it's it all has an explanation
uh for example you

[1:24:31]
uh for example you
mentioned
um yeah being uh being better for
yourself and allowing yourself to to be
fine with showing up maybe not not at
your aame and it's it's just very normal
that if you have a a life needing to

[1:24:46]
that if you have a a life needing to
balance different stuff against each
other that that that it's going to
happen and uh definitely shouldn't beat
yourself up too much over those type of
things I feel I'm curious could you
maybe uh little sackway here maybe

[1:25:00]
maybe uh little sackway here maybe
elaborate on the on the different how
did you say it the relation relation no
money relationship types uh Financial
personality types like Financial
personality T because I I can relate and
I think people maybe that are also in a

[1:25:15]
I think people maybe that are also in a
relationship you know they can relate I
grew up Netherlands this Village you
know I never had any worry in my life my
wife Brazil completely different and
actually we had some podcast on with
Brazilians I think it was Pedro yeah I
think Pedro mentioned it that he sees

[1:25:30]
think Pedro mentioned it that he sees
like Brazilians are way more focused on
security you know using poker as Finance
security is very important because
because they they have that less right
when growing up so we have completely
different types we think completely
different about money I keep her out of

[1:25:45]
different about money I keep her out of
like poker swings always when she asked
me how did it go I always say yeah yeah
you know went okay I guess it guess like
when she never asked me how much I won
or lost you know it's just like how did
it go and she says you always give the
same answer it always went yeah yeah but

[1:26:00]
same answer it always went yeah yeah but
she leaves it at that like she doesn't
press on for the results I guess that's
nice no no no because like I I I learned
that like she yeah for for her she
cannot handle handle the variants uh so
I just leave her out out of what's going

[1:26:16]
I just leave her out out of what's going
on in that in that area but yeah there
are basically eight Arch types in terms
of financial personality uh I think
maybe the primary one for me and
probably the one that most porker
players are going to have is like the

[1:26:30]
players are going to have is like the
rebel so this is kind of the the
Prototype of like a risk taker someone
who's uh very good with financial
decisions who
um yeah like a risk mostly risk taker is
not too attached to to money sees it as

[1:26:48]
not too attached to to money sees it as
as a tool um kind of that type of
personality and then my girlfriend her
primary
money type is the collector which is
someone who always wants more money

[1:27:00]
someone who always wants more money
feels like she won't have enough tries
to kind accumulate
accumulate that's that's actually the
correct term
accumulator um and those are kind of
yeah very conflicting with each other uh
because she sees losing money as as

[1:27:17]
because she sees losing money as as
something bad while while as a poker
player and as a rebel of course uh it's
just necessary part of of the process
and uh but now that that we know that
these types of different personalities

[1:27:31]
these types of different personalities
exists uh we we kind of understand each
other a lot better um and that's that's
been definitely uh a good thing to
experience and and I've noticed that
when you mention these types of
financial personalities is definitely
something that a lot of people are

[1:27:45]
something that a lot of people are
interested in
um because it's it it speaks to people
like
people um realiz I that we're just born
different and other people have
different personality types and that's
going to influence how how we think

[1:28:00]
going to influence how how we think
about things how we interact with each
other and realizing that hey people are
different it's normal that conflict
arises or that you think different about
this it's I like it when when there's an

[1:28:15]
this it's I like it when when there's an
explanation for things why why why you
can explain why your reality is the way
it
is I think the biggest thing that it
contributes to a relationship is the
ability to show empathy for the other
person because you understand when

[1:28:30]
person because you understand when
there's a conflict and let's say for
example I'm sure you've had a financial
Conflict for example in the past with
your girlfriend but now that you kind of
understand like oh but you're just a
completely different you have a you have
a different character you have a
different type so you understand where
she comes from so then there's no no

[1:28:48]
she comes from so then there's no no
more friction and obviously you know you
you you you understand and you give
empathy towards the situation I
definitely can relate I think exactly my
wife is a collector she always wants
more and more and it's almost feels like
if if it goes down it's like a certain

[1:29:01]
if if it goes down it's like a certain
sense of I feel like The Collector comes
from a certain High need of security or
safety and then when you lose money it's
related to oh I I just lost a piece of
my safety or a piece of my piece of my
certainty where indeed where where you

[1:29:15]
certainty where indeed where where you
said it I see it as like bullets
munition you know we need we as poker
plays we have money we need to shoot you
know I see it just as you know I need it
I don't give the same value to it as she
does you know so obviously you know if
you lose a big chunk of your net worth

[1:29:30]
you lose a big chunk of your net worth
and she literally fused now 25% less
safe or less less secure that's a
problem uh where you see it just like oh
investment turned
bad yeah exactly and and I think indeed
like the upbringing that you mentioned
of your your wife or girlfriend uh

[1:29:47]
of your your wife or girlfriend uh
coming from uh a background where
there's more scarcity definitely leads
you into more of an accumulation mindset
where if you don't have have this type
of environment growing up because it's

[1:30:00]
of environment growing up because it's
almost a little bit of a financial
trauma um yeah having not especially as
a child when you don't understand why
there's not enough money or why you
can't pay for certain things that other
families can um it can have a big big

[1:30:15]
families can um it can have a big big
effect on you and and I also come from
this this backgrounds of just a nice
middle class
family um really very average in terms
of uh of financial um capabilities but
but definitely didn't have anything to

[1:30:30]
but definitely didn't have anything to
worry or never felt like we're going to
lose our house or we're going to not be
able to pay for important stuff like
that and definitely we've both been
blessed uh being able to to grow up in
those types of families yeah I feel like
in uh if you grew up if you were born in

[1:30:46]
in uh if you grew up if you were born in
the Netherlands or Belgium you know
you're already born a bit Lucky in terms
of there's less like people of different
social classes live next to other but
there's less of a show of culture so
your neighbor can be very rich and you
can be moderate and everyone just gets

[1:31:00]
can be moderate and everyone just gets
along whereas in Brazil it's way more if
you're poor you're actually really poor
and your lifestyle really changes if
you're rich you're very rich and your
lifestyle really changes so you see rich
and poor way more so you growing up and
like you said I definitely think it's a
some sort of a trauma because in her

[1:31:16]
some sort of a trauma because in her
case also like it feels like it's never
enough you know that's for The Collector
at some point it's never enough it's
like yeah okay you have now already x
amount of money it's like and you know
at some point you need to feel secure
with the amount of money that you have
like where does it end you know uh so

[1:31:30]
like where does it end you know uh so
yeah that's that's really interesting to
see in terms of uh relationship

but without further Ado let's get back
into more goodness in today's

[1:33:16]
episode I wanted to bring it back to uh
to a little bit of Poker uh you
mentioned the transition to life you
even recommended like oh if you're
already beating you know 500 average
buying you know maybe you should try to

[1:33:30]
buying you know maybe you should try to
take a shot at like some of these live
high rers right I think that's what you
said that currently now that's where the
rri is high but you talked about it like
it was a
transition that basically was literally
the same game or it's that's kind of the
vibe that it got from yeah you know you

[1:33:45]
vibe that it got from yeah you know you
just switch to live so I'm curious like
how was your experience switching from
online to live and what adjustments do
you think are necessary like how is the
environment
different yeah so so I actually like I
mentioned had played a lot of live

[1:34:00]
mentioned had played a lot of live
tournaments over the course of my career
didn't really have big successes now of
course going to tritons is is um is a
bit different uh but at the same time
it's not like was the first time I was
playing live I just knew the type of

[1:34:15]
playing live I just knew the type of
players that were going to be in those
fields I compared them to the strength
of players in the online games I was
playing so and and it just felt like
okay uh players online are going to be
be a bit tougher and you're going to
have more recreational players in these

[1:34:31]
have more recreational players in these
uh live live tournaments which is very
understandable right just a live
tournament has a lot more to offer to to
a recreational poker player because it's
also a social experience they get to
travel they get to yeah just sit face to

[1:34:46]
travel they get to yeah just sit face to
face with people talk it's it's just
more friendly to it's a more chill
environment than sitting behind here
computer alone in your room so it it's
natural that those fields are going to
be a bit more bit softer than than

[1:35:00]
be a bit more bit softer than than
online so just knowing that the online
games I was playing were were definitely
more difficult I was performing well in
them uh and then it definitely helped
going to my first Triton there in uh in

[1:35:16]
going to my first Triton there in uh in
2022 coming ride off two huge scores
online I think in in the course of like
four days I had at the 400k first place
and a 600k third place um and then so I

[1:35:30]
and a 600k third place um and then so I
was already feeling quite well uh
feeling quite confident and then I went
to play my first tritons actually
bubbled ex Stone bubbled a 30k Tron
event for 85k M cash and then the next

[1:35:45]
event for 85k M cash and then the next
one was a 50k 6 Max and then I was able
to come out on top of that one so it's
really a nice story of kind of the the
max pain I would say in a tournament uh
and then the max gain in the next one so

[1:36:01]
and then the max gain in the next one so
um yeah the in terms of adjustments
sorry but go ahead yeah I was going to
say that that that that is a big bubble
30 85k like I don't know much about FTS
but that sounds like a huge a huge
bubble yeah true well in some online

[1:36:16]
bubble yeah true well in some online
games you have like bubbles that are
four five times a buy but yeah I I
believe it was something like that or
maybe was 78k I'm not exactly sure but
it was definitely uh more than than
twice the buying by by a bit of a margin

[1:36:32]
twice the buying by by a bit of a margin
um how does that change like strategy
both I think let's go it like pre-bubble
because I guess like I guess having less
chips hurts you more having more chips
earns you earns you more so how does

[1:36:45]
earns you earns you more so how does
that change I understand like on the
bubble the kind of effects that would
have but how how does that kind of
change a little bit pre-bubble
well how how I see it the more important
that the Min cach is uh the more

[1:37:00]
that the Min cach is uh the more
important is to to try to get to that
Min cach so it just means taking less
risk uh as the field Narrows down um and
especially when you're on the exact
bubble the the ranges by which you can
call all ins just become very very uh

[1:37:18]
call all ins just become very very uh
very condensed especially in those those
online games where I was mentioning four
or five times the and they just like
three four five people paid um because
of the small field uh there the strategy

[1:37:30]
of the small field uh there the strategy
really becomes uh crazy it often ends up
being like some guy with 40 big blinds
and then three or four other people with
10 big blinds and just the guy with 40
big BL just open jamming every hand
every hand yeah the others can only call

[1:37:45]
every hand yeah the others can only call
Jack CL basically so how would that like
obviously because the EV of being the
40bb guy is so much greater how would
that for example maybe if you're two
tables or three tables in in do you make
any any adjustments like is it worth

[1:38:01]
any any adjustments like is it worth
taking a little bit more risk here and
there because like it it's a bit hard
right because obviously you're not going
to make a minus E decision but you could
maybe make a minus EV chip decision
that's higher variant because you know
in the future having the stack is so is

[1:38:15]
in the future having the stack is so is
worth so much more than just hanging
on yeah that's that's an interesting
topic I think there are quite uh
differing op iions on this if you ask
maybe 20 of the the best players that
you might get some very different

[1:38:30]
you might get some very different
answers uh but I feel like it's usually
not worth to gamble for a bigger stack
especially in this format
because the the the payoff is just not
well not high enough like maybe in this

[1:38:46]
well not high enough like maybe in this
extreme scenario where you know you're
going to be able to like put maximum
pressure on everyone uh at basic a
single table during the bubble it it's a
very unique situation but in general um

[1:39:00]
very unique situation but in general um
if you're talking already about making a
minus EV chip decision it's definitely
going to be minus uh Dollar in terms of
ICM so you're immediately like
sacrificing ICM dollars and even chips

[1:39:16]
sacrificing ICM dollars and even chips
to maybe get that big stack uh well
maybe it's a bit hard to quantify the
exact value uh of having that big stack
because it also depends how the other
Stacks uh develop um it's it's really

[1:39:30]
Stacks uh develop um it's it's really
hard but I feel like being conservative
as you come closer to the bubble
especially as as a mid
stack uh is more at least my Approach
than than thinking okay hey um if I
double here I'm going to be the big stck

[1:39:46]
double here I'm going to be the big stck
bully that kind of
stuff I don't feel
like too much of that comes in
uh unless on the exact bubble where like
people have to be extremely tight but
even then that can only especially when

[1:40:01]
even then that can only especially when
you have multiple Tes that can only take
a couple of hands that you're really
able to capitalize on that
position um if it's a single table with
such a special bubble of course things
change but that's kind of more of a rare
occasion and most people haven't even

[1:40:16]
occasion and most people haven't even
ever come into a situation like that
because the the fields fields are
usually bigger than the bubble happening
on one table right yeah that's why I was
so curious when you mentioned like this
these huge bubble like oh that that's

[1:40:30]
these huge bubble like oh that that's
that's pretty interesting and this is
like actually one of the things that you
you least liked about poker right
because we were talking about
uncertainty that and the fact that
solvers came just that offer like some
certainty so how do you deal with like
all this like especially in around the
ICM and around tournaments there's a lot

[1:40:45]
ICM and around tournaments there's a lot
of things that like you said you can
talk to 20 players and you still you
always go back to poker in the past
right where we didn't have the answer
mhm yeah I think um those type of
situations just
require um another another model to

[1:41:00]
require um another another model to
study there are definitely tools that uh
make these ICM calculations for you and
if the you you just input a different
price pool different type of Min cach
and you see the outputs change so it's
it's definitely something as I got

[1:41:15]
it's definitely something as I got
confronted with these types of problems
and not sure if I made a correct mistake
a correct decision I I would kind of go
check and run a Sim to see hey uh was
this correct and how far was I off and
and sometimes you see okay I was correct

[1:41:31]
and sometimes you see okay I was correct
it was fine I shouldn't have to feel bad
or or doubt myself but it's good to know
and other times I just see oh I made a
big mistake here let let's give give
this spot some time uh to make sure that
next time I'm I'm better equipped to

[1:41:47]
next time I'm I'm better equipped to
make the correct decision um so yeah I
just definitely had to like uh
specifically study those type of
situations because they they are a lot
of different than when the main Cas is

[1:42:00]
of different than when the main Cas is
maybe 1.5 ex to buy in or you're just
playing a very large field also
different
Yeah you mentioned that you know
nowadays there's a lot of tools tools
get better even like for these type of
things right you can kind of put in

[1:42:15]
things right you can kind of put in
various ICM situations and see how the
solver would change you mentioned when
solvers came out earlier in the
conversation is that solvers allowed you
to discover the science behind poker
which I really loved I really loved that
phrase I wrote it down how how has

[1:42:30]
phrase I wrote it down how how has
solvers helped you understand the
science of Poker and what what did you
learn about the science of
Poker yeah so uh I think it was
mentioned I have a degree in computer
science so I am technically a scientist
and I definitely believe in the uh

[1:42:47]
and I definitely believe in the uh
scientific methods in terms of solving
problems um so when solvers kind of uh
came onto the scene the the game theory
uh behind game theory is kind of a

[1:43:00]
uh behind game theory is kind of a
component of mathematics
um it it it was I also read books about
the game theory before that um not
related to Poker and it just it gave me
a framework uh or at least a a the way

[1:43:17]
a framework uh or at least a a the way
that these outputs kind of uh come to be
they are there's like mathematics behind
it there's there's logic behind it
there's no uh human bias involved uh and
that's just a nice Baseline to start

[1:43:32]
that's just a nice Baseline to start
working from uh and when you talk just
talking to people they have their own
biases their own experiences their
own uh player the way they are as a

[1:43:45]
own uh player the way they are as a
player and on the way the hands they've
maybe even recently played that
influence their perception of the spot
you just have a lot of human things that
come into it and that's not
really
um yeah something you can trust very

[1:44:00]
um yeah something you can trust very
well especially if it's someone else's
opinion and then you have to draw
conclusions from that becomes very
difficult just solers were this thing
that okay uh you can you can trust this
as long of course as you do have to
thinker a lot with the parameters and

[1:44:16]
thinker a lot with the parameters and
the inputs and those can also have a a
big influence to
um that's definitely there there as well
but it just it gave me something to
study it gave me something um that I
could rely

[1:44:31]
could rely
on
um and yeah those tools have definitely
gotten a lot of lot better over the
years um I really like GTO wizard for
example
um because it just becomes very uh

[1:44:45]
um because it just becomes very uh
intuitive for people to to use right in
browser first solver I used was was
Spyro solver you had to like have a
different
server for that you had to to yeah the
tree setup it wasn't for many people I

[1:45:00]
tree setup it wasn't for many people I
think not that easy to do and the fact
that I maybe was quite familiar with
computers and also during during my
education there were a lot of these
setup problems I kind of called them
where you need to work in a certain

[1:45:15]
where you need to work in a certain
programming environment but then
actually setting up the programming
environment was like maybe one of the
the hardest thing kind of getting
familiar with this this uh environment
that you have to work in that kind of
was a challenge a lot but just just

[1:45:31]
was a challenge a lot but just just
having to do it because of because of
your uh education kind of also made me
do it more for probably solver software
which I think for many people was
just um a big hurdle to take and now you
have these types of solvers that you

[1:45:46]
have these types of solvers that you
just use in the browser and and are very
intuitive to use and it's become a lot
more mainstream I think to to check a
spots in a
solver um yeah so it's which Futures do
you like the most which Futures do you

[1:46:01]
you like the most which Futures do you
like the most uh when it comes out the
GT wizard I think the the training
feature is great uh I used to have
something similar uh set up in the past
actually uh when I still had the the bio
solver Library there was this kind of

[1:46:16]
solver Library there was this kind of
program that let you play against
those um hands that you kind of saved on
your hard drive but I was familiar with
the concept before and but and I think
it's it's one of the best ways to learn
because you're can of just playing hand

[1:46:30]
because you're can of just playing hand
uh and seeing mistakes and it it comes
closest to the Natural decision process
that you're you're taking at at the
online
tables um the ICM postop solver is is I
think uh something really nice that I

[1:46:46]
think uh something really nice that I
was kind of waiting for um because gpv
decisions uh uh um they're actually not
that frequent anymore I would say well
anymore most of the important decisions

[1:47:00]
anymore most of the important decisions
are going to be under the influence of
ICM in mtts so you kind of want
some some way to also study that and um
I think that's really the the AI solving
wizard U is really nice so I think those

[1:47:17]
wizard U is really nice so I think those
two um and of course there are many
great other features but I think those
uh those have a lot of value for me you
have some advice around how to best
study with with solvers because you

[1:47:31]
study with with solvers because you
already mentioned especially in the past
right when you had to set everything up
there's a lot of Errors you could make
around the parameters I mention I I
remember blundering various times where
it's like oh this output looks a bit
different maybe I'm on to something oh
no I just forgot that I I this allowed

[1:47:45]
no I just forgot that I I this allowed
the solver to do x and x which sometimes
in that process actually you learned a
lot of valuable stuff as well so it
wasn't completely useless like you said
nowadays uh stuff like GTO wizard you
know they've already run everything for
you to made sure the parameters were
right so they they they give you good

[1:48:00]
right so they they they give you good
Solutions how do
you get the most out of it so how does
kind of your study process look because
nowadays everyone has the tools so now
the ad is more okay how do we use the
tool do you have some advice around that
yeah I think the most important uh thing

[1:48:17]
yeah I think the most important uh thing
to to to realize is um which decisions
or which spots are actually very
important and uh influence EV in a
tournament a
lot um and and study those uh like have

[1:48:34]
lot um and and study those uh like have
these different categories of spots uh
for example just short stack B flop ICM
spots are quite important then I think
SE betting on on boards is for example

[1:48:45]
SE betting on on boards is for example
something very important I've always uh
been of the opinion that the the further
you you go away from like pre flop so
you have four streets in poker the
higher uh the number of the street
basically is the less confidence you can
actually put into a solver because

[1:49:00]
actually put into a solver because
humans are going to deviate on later
streets the uh error is just going to
become come bigger think pre flop and
flop is is easy to study you can kind of
replicate that from a solver without too

[1:49:15]
replicate that from a solver without too
much I mean of course you have to keep
thinking but uh I think solver outputs
for those streets are very good and also
easier to to learn because there's
less less history uh in in the game
three of that certain speed uh so I

[1:49:32]
three of that certain speed uh so I
think actually focusing attention there
and then
having a good understanding of course of
of turn and River spots so I think maybe
there's more you can use a trainer more

[1:49:45]
there's more you can use a trainer more
for those kind of spots and and maybe
try to more religiously copy the solver
on pre flop and flop Stu
and then turn and River you you really
have to I feel
like uh learn more general concepts and

[1:50:01]
like uh learn more general concepts and
be able to apply those in in game
[Music]
um yeah I think that's that's that's
some decent uh that's actually just how
I view it of course I could be
completely wrong but I feel like it

[1:50:15]
completely wrong but I feel like it
makes some some sense
um yeah pref flop is very important NTS
uh a lot of the times especially late
stage you're going to be all in Pre flop
um and and you can actually get

[1:50:31]
um and and you can actually get
reasonably quite accurate in in in those
and the using the trainer you you really
filter out where you're still making
mistakes and I think it's quite
motivating to to see your score improve
over time um as you do those drills it's

[1:50:47]
over time um as you do those drills it's
a bit like a video game right it's kind
of game gamification of a game you know
uh I'm wondering you mentioned obviously
the later the street for the deviation
is it then also you mentioned already
the impact of human bias that I kind of

[1:51:00]
the impact of human bias that I kind of
wanted to touch on like how does that
obviously we see the strategy on the
screen how do we then translate that to
the real world where there's human bias
you feel like the human bias just
compounds also when when the streets
progress so following the solver quote
quote ridly is not going to be as

[1:51:16]
quote ridly is not going to be as
efficient as pre flop and under flop and
do you maybe have an example of how
human bias then impacts the strategy on
these later Street yeah for sure I think
um threee flop people pay quite close to
to what solvers say on the Flop some

[1:51:31]
to what solvers say on the Flop some
people uh do some weird stuff maybe
already but most people
still copy the the or or use sizes that
make sense according to solver but then
in turns and rivers um yeah as the hand

[1:51:46]
in turns and rivers um yeah as the hand
progresses uh there's like at every
decision Point There's an opportunity
for a player to kind of make a deviation
from what what the solver says or what
this may be optimal uh and
it's yeah as you get to the turn in the

[1:52:02]
it's yeah as you get to the turn in the
river it's those deviations become more
impactful on the eventual result of what
a solver would still uh still say uh
best example maybe just on the

[1:52:16]
best example maybe just on the
river um where maybe the solver is
saying uh you bet go all those hands
these type of hands but then in reality
the spot is usually under bluffed people
don't find the bloves

[1:52:30]
don't find the bloves
or and and and it's just burning money
to against most people in the population
to to call so white they actually have
tojust by just folding more
um or or bluffing more because people
call too tight that kind of stuff it's

[1:52:46]
call too tight that kind of stuff it's
just on the river it becomes more
population dependent and player
dependent than on the flop for examp
example
um it's it's actually rare for me I
think to base my flop decision on oh I'm

[1:53:00]
think to base my flop decision on oh I'm
placing playing against this guy or this
guy I'm now going to use a different
size um or I'm gonna maybe in sometimes
you have decision do I see it or do I
check back I think against more

[1:53:16]
check back I think against more
competent players you actually balance
that a bit better than maybe against
players that that is not so important
but
uh it's kind of a standard standard game
I would say on the flot but then as the
hand
progresses um player Tendencies

[1:53:32]
progresses um player Tendencies
population Tendencies intuition about
the spot it becomes more important in my
experience which also makes sense right
because as you mentioned pre- flop
players play Closer to Optimal flop
still close to Optimal and basically the

[1:53:46]
still close to Optimal and basically the
closer people play to Optimal the better
it is to just focus more on defense and
you just play a solid GTO strategy but
when they start to deviate this also
when you started to deviate how do you
study the
exploitative part of the game how do you

[1:54:00]
exploitative part of the game how do you
get better at playing term rivers and
finding these
exploits uh it's it's for me it's mostly
about studying how how the game should
be played even in GTO I know I'm not
that big of a note Locker myself uh I

[1:54:18]
that big of a note Locker myself uh I
think the problem with not locking is
that it's a manual operation always is
and you you can only study one spot you
have to kind of spend a lot of time it's
also involves usually an assumption
about your opponent's game again uh

[1:54:31]
about your opponent's game again uh
which is dangerous to make I feel um
you're usually going to end up with a
lot of uh decisions that are close in EV
uh between for example checking the turn
or continuing to Second barrel and there

[1:54:46]
or continuing to Second barrel and there
it's mostly more like a logical
reasoning against this type of player or
um
given how usually hands are being played
or or what I how I think he will react
uh I'm going to choose this option when

[1:55:01]
uh I'm going to choose this option when
I know in GTO it's it's the EVS are
quite close you know and if I feel like
there's a
clear uh best play I I will usually make
that one if it's close then you just
start reasoning okay against this guy in

[1:55:18]
start reasoning okay against this guy in
this situation or or what I want to
achieve I think I will I will do now
this knowing that it's even in in a GTO
context quite quite close and kind of
needs your own bias your own input at

[1:55:31]
needs your own bias your own input at
that point to to make a decision between
the two very close
options yeah that's important to to to
explain as well because like in solver
when a hand is played pure in a certain
way it's usually because you know it it

[1:55:46]
way it's usually because you know it it
just has clear eristics that make that
line pure right that for that hand to
suddenly play different the player type
would have to be very different than
someone who's GTO It's usually the hands
that are a mix where it's like hey these

[1:56:00]
that are a mix where it's like hey these
are more sensitive to be influenced like
the the EV of these plays are more
sensitive to be influenced by the
opponent that I'm playing again so when
you're in a spot even and you like I
said you already sometimes have it on a
flop it's like this hand is actually
Clos it's not a range back board it's
not a range check board this hand is

[1:56:16]
not a range check board this hand is
close can generate EV in different ways
and then like oh I have a mediocre hand
my opponent is pretty aggressive well
let's just check back and let him Bluff
me and I'll just call for example right
so those hands require more thinking in
terms of hm how does this hand generate

[1:56:31]
terms of hm how does this hand generate
EV versus my opponent then if you don't
know anything about your opponent your
opponent plays dto we go back to the
solver which said yeah you were
indifferent anyway so just do half half
and you know figure it out um this is

[1:56:45]
and you know figure it out um this is
also where Street poker thinking comes
in that's something that you mention
earlier in the podcast as well right the
street poker thinking what do you mean
exactly by that and I think you also
mentioned something around uh that
people should focus on improving their

[1:57:00]
people should focus on improving their
decision making process so how does the
decision- making process how do people
improve on that and where does the the
street Poker come in yeah the street
poker I kind of view this as um given
that uh I played a lot before solvers

[1:57:17]
that uh I played a lot before solvers
were a thing and before it was a
clear greenwork to fall back on
it was most of us were just trying to
reason logically of course um but
without much yeah things to fall back on

[1:57:33]
without much yeah things to fall back on
I think that was kind of the era of
Street poker where um you make decisions
in in a way different way
[Music]
and and I think that kind of helps you

[1:57:47]
and and I think that kind of helps you
uh that kind of still helps me when I
get to in a situation where I'm not sure
how the solver would play or how would
react um and it helps you also in trying
to come up with exploits or uh getting a

[1:58:02]
to come up with exploits or uh getting a
little bit in the situation where
um yeah how you think the player plays
how population plays and and how you
adjust to that um outside of kind of

[1:58:15]
adjust to that um outside of kind of
this this uh this world that's purely
the solver um it's
it's kind of the the human element the
human intuition built up over time uh
and mostly trained through an era where

[1:58:32]
and mostly trained through an era where
you you didn't really
have solvers or something clear to fall
back on maybe not the clearest PO
process or the clearest
framework uh in place but you still had

[1:58:45]
framework uh in place but you still had
to make decisions you still had to make
adjustments and and having that having
had that experience I think uh uh helps
you right now uh when you're outside of
your like known Theory Zone

[1:59:00]
your like known Theory Zone
uh and then uh the other yeah focusing
on decision making process is basically
almost the same I would say as trying to
improve at poker because of course poker
is
making a lot of decisions and trying to

[1:59:15]
making a lot of decisions and trying to
make the well the best decision um given
the knowledge at the time
and uh making sure you're equipped to to
make those decisions and and most of
that is is probably going to come

[1:59:31]
that is is probably going to come
through through
studying uh with solvers um and and
making yeah making yourself equipped to
kind of deal with different situations
as they come up at the porker table um

[1:59:45]
as they come up at the porker table um
and as I said before probably focus on
uh those situations that come up the
most that generate the most e
v
um kind of improve as a player is is the
only thing you can really do if you want

[2:00:00]
only thing you can really do if you want
to improve your results even though
sometimes it might feel like what does
it even matter if I improve as a player
uh this guy just won a tournament he's
really not the greatest player he's
making these and these mistakes and not
making these mistakes not having these
type of

[2:00:16]
type of
results for for sure in in the live
scene there there is this this thing
where you're just going to have people
run very hot over a five or 10 year
period even a lot of of EV and and
others are just not going to have the

[2:00:31]
others are just not going to have the
results even though they're great
players so there's also even though you
should focus on on becoming a better
player and and because it's the only
thing you really can do at the same time
all the results are just going to be all

[2:00:46]
all the results are just going to be all
over the place and not necessarily that
correlated to to this the skill of of
the player participating in this
tournament so that's also a realization
that you're going to have to make uh or
or need to have is that while there's

[2:01:01]
or need to have is that while there's
definitely competitive element in poker
I feel like for True
competitors they might often be like
kind of disappointed especially in
entities
because yeah you're you're just not
going to be the best players are not

[2:01:15]
going to be the best players are not
really going to be having the best
results it's almost unlik very unlikely
uh that the the ones having the best
results are actually the best players uh
in the field and it's it's kind of
something you have to accept it's what
makes Poker unique it's what uh makes it

[2:01:32]
makes Poker unique it's what uh makes it
a game that can be played for money uh
where actually good players can kind of
reliably make money because of the fact
that some uh worse players participate
and it's really what makes Poker unique

[2:01:46]
and it's really what makes Poker unique
but it is something you do have to uh
accept while at the same same time still
having the motivation to to improve and
and to become better and to make good
decisions because that's at the end of
the day the only thing that you can
really influence and have an impact on

[2:02:03]
really influence and have an impact on
um yeah yeah it's it's can definitely be
very frustrating at times of course
every poker player knows but in the end
yeah there's a reason why people like to
go play poker against the best and not
chess against the best right this it's

[2:02:16]
chess against the best right this it's
just no fun and I can definitely see how
athletes that go-play poker see how this
might be a bit unfair like you know if
you're if you're just a better you're
just a better football team you know
obviously there are some variants but
usually over a couple matches it will

[2:02:31]
usually over a couple matches it will
show that you were the better football
team right whereas in poker like I said
five to 10 years varant in life poker I
mean that's that that's pretty insane to
to touch on the decision decision-
making a little bit more uh I was
curious like when you make
decisions what for you are some of the

[2:02:47]
decisions what for you are some of the
most important things that you take in
consideration and maybe also what are
some things that in European people pay
way too much attention to or give way
too much weight to when making a
decision it's a bit of a difficult

[2:03:01]
decision it's a bit of a difficult
question for me to to answer I would say
because for me I'm
not I I I usually get to a decision or
to an idea pops into my head quite
intuitively and then I start thinking
about it but the the core of the idea or

[2:03:16]
about it but the the core of the idea or
the core of the decision or what I want
to do is usually already there in some
sort of conscious way that's being
handed to me and then you start kind of
uh questioning that idea or trying to to

[2:03:30]
uh questioning that idea or trying to to
find a flaw in in the idea or trying to
kind of maybe convince you of something
else more from like the The Logical
mind
[Music]
um but that yeah it's really hard for me

[2:03:45]
um but that yeah it's really hard for me
to like um have like a really structured
way of course it's like okay my range
his range the board how it interacts
um the stack to BT ratio how how the
hand is going to develop over multiple
streets all that stuff is definitely

[2:04:01]
streets all that stuff is definitely
there uh but I would say most of
like decisions come quite n naturally to
me it's like uh not really conscious way
of thinking like you could say okay I'm
going to check or I'm going to bit and

[2:04:16]
going to check or I'm going to bit and
I'm going to evaluate both options and
once I've uh had the pros and cons for
each of those options now I make my
decision it's it's it's different for me
it's more like I feel like I want a bet
and then I start thinking is this

[2:04:30]
and then I start thinking is this
really uh the correct play should maybe
I should check sometimes or and maybe in
only a minority of the case I actually
change my decision um it feels very
intuitive to me most of the time so

[2:04:46]
intuitive to me most of the time so
you're very very in tune with your
emotions like we already talked a little
bit about human bias coming in
especially we talked a bit more about
that the how that influence how that
influences our opponents how do you
minimize falling victim for human bias

[2:05:02]
minimize falling victim for human bias
yourself and what is like maybe you can
give an example of a bias that that that
that you still sometimes feel like you
fall victim to that you have a hard time
correcting I think maybe one of the the

[2:05:15]
correcting I think maybe one of the the
biggest difficulties or biggest flaws
maybe currently still in my thinking is
maybe and I think this is also
applicable outside of Poker is that um
kind of a tendency to assume that other
people are also thinking the way that

[2:05:30]
people are also thinking the way that
you are thinking or playing that the way
that you are playing uh and that can
lead to to wrong decision making and
wrong assumptions um and that's always
it's I think that thing is always going
to be present because you're going to
weason about your opponent as if you

[2:05:45]
weason about your opponent as if you
were playing in his shoes um but if you
haven't maybe uh if you're for example
have a very different playing style to
the population or you're ahead of you're
have a big skill gap between you and

[2:06:01]
have a big skill gap between you and
your opponent that's not going to be the
right way to approach the situation
usually um but I do think in generally
like your your own bias is kind of uh
also what makes you your unique type of

[2:06:15]
also what makes you your unique type of
Poker play like your own bias also has
your exploits or the way you're going to
uh think about what the right play is
and I think it's it's also important to
to trust it and but to realize why why

[2:06:32]
to trust it and but to realize why why
why you're you view the game this way um
and it does have some some logic behind
it usually uh like
I it's hard to give a specific situation

[2:06:45]
I it's hard to give a specific situation
but but for example maybe at at some
point in the past I believed I believe
like there was this tendency of just uh
range SE betting for for a 33% U pop for
example and then there was this people

[2:07:01]
example and then there was this people
as people started studying certain spots
more people started experimenting with
the bigger bed sizes on the
Flop um and then
just thinking how it would like affect

[2:07:15]
just thinking how it would like affect
people or how realizing certain people
are playing suboptimally against this
and then kind of really trying to abuse
uh those bigger bit sizes to get more
fults or to get sometimes more calls
and um it's it's it's it's hard of

[2:07:32]
and um it's it's it's it's hard of
course to describe your we're almost
trying to describe kind of yeah your
strategy building and and how your your
way of thinking about the game is and I
don't think it's really fit to be put
into words very well

[2:07:47]
into words very well
um but of course I your your your the
bias that you develop is can of your
your nature as a player and how you
think uh you should be playing uh
certain hands yeah I can uh I can

[2:08:00]
certain hands yeah I can uh I can
definitely relate with the projection
bias obviously for example it's easier
let's say you play vers recreational and
if you kind of studied recreational
Tendencies You Understand sort of how
they approach the game and then when you
understand their flaws you kind of
understand how they're thinking so you
don't really fall victim to that but the
closer your opponent starts to

[2:08:17]
closer your opponent starts to
play like optimally there it becomes a
little bit harder and then basically
what you're going to do is you're going
to project sort of GTO with a mix of
what you know but then there's like
certain spots where it's like oh it if
he really knows that this spot is very

[2:08:31]
he really knows that this spot is very
easily over bluffed or under bluffed if
he knows that he can take advantage of
it but does he know that and then for
there it's like yeah I don't know how to
really estimate your opponent like and
and you know even within Rex you know
you have clear like nid guyses clear

[2:08:45]
you have clear like nid guyses clear
more aggressive guys so you can kind of
but there is a range where it just
becomes more difficult and that's I
guess where good intuitive players that
have a good feel for the situation I
guess that's where it comes in they just
seem to be able to be on know on which

[2:09:00]
seem to be able to be on know on which
level their opponent thinking and
therefore they can kind of sort of
outthink their opponent right uh I'm
curious um in your looking back through
your poker career what has been the
biggest strategical breakthrough that
you've had where you're like oh wow that

[2:09:16]
you've had where you're like oh wow that
was a big aha moment this can be maybe
studies study sessions that you done in
the solver this could also be
uh coaching that you got from someone
you mentioned also more recently working
more or getting more in touch with J uh
any any type of aha moment that stick

[2:09:30]
any any type of aha moment that stick
out in poker for you where like oh this
definitely changed how I approach the
game um tough It's kind of tough to say
I I maybe uh in the beginning when I
started working with solvers kind of
studying for example for the ex the

[2:09:46]
studying for example for the ex the
exact same stack size how uh under the
gun lowjack and button were playing the
exact same board against the big bind
for example and then how that kind of
changed bet sizes betting frequencies um

[2:10:02]
changed bet sizes betting frequencies um
I think that was really because I was
coming from this situation where you
play the small blind you play a big
blind in heads up okay there are the
ranges are quite wide but uh in mtts
having those different scenarios where

[2:10:17]
having those different scenarios where
your range widens up as closer you get
to the button um also the big blind
range changes of course defends wider if
your range is weak rebets uh wider if
your range is weak um that helped me a

[2:10:32]
your range is weak um that helped me a
lot kind of to to realize uh the
differences in playing style uh even if
you're the aggressor depending on on on
what your range look like looks like
uh it it's it's maybe explaining it

[2:10:47]
uh it it's it's maybe explaining it
seems a bit silly that this is like a
big aha moment but
um yeah for me it's just it kind of
opened up more strategic diversity in
terms of uh all these spots are kind of

[2:11:01]
terms of uh all these spots are kind of
difficult and they lead to to a
different game three afterwards whereas
before that I was just way too static in
thinking we're going to a flop uh I have
this range or this hand and I'm not
really that much aware of the Dynamics

[2:11:15]
really that much aware of the Dynamics
for what what's going on at all yeah you
don't even have to think anymore about
the range of your has because always the
same range so in in that process it's
that that's why I can understand I think
I heard once the podcast with Kevin
rabbitow where he said he when he
transitioned from Cash Cash heads up

[2:11:31]
transitioned from Cash Cash heads up
cash games to mtts and he was applying
the same study method from heads up cash
to mtts he's who realized well if I
continue this same study method I will
have studied mtts 40 years from now you
know because it has some Cas you can
just go so in deep depth where you

[2:11:45]
just go so in deep depth where you
approach it more like the poker
scientist right what you mentioned that
you use solver to understand the science
poker so where what you did is you set
it up a tide formation wide formation a
couple boards and then see okay what is
the impact of wider ranges versus
tighter ranges or and then you could use

[2:12:02]
tighter ranges or and then you could use
the same and then just sayange stack
sizes oh what happens if the stack size
is greater stack size is smaller so mtts
requires a way more holistic approach
whereas cash games you can or cash games
in general and especially as up you can
zoom in way you can go way more in depth

[2:12:17]
zoom in way you can go way more in depth
uh because we there's just less
variables to study basically uh so I can
defin understand that if you if you
transition from hats up to mtts that
that's obviously a huge aha moment for
you uh I'm also curious also curious

[2:12:30]
you uh I'm also curious also curious
what people do on a on a daily basis now
you said that you let's say for example
there is a there's an online event
coming that you want to play let's say
it takes like a four-week event or
something how does your preparation
towards an event like that look like
nowadays and how does your day-to-day

[2:12:46]
nowadays and how does your day-to-day
look
like so yeah in terms of preparing it
all uh
[Music]
study a bit more
intensively um try to repeat certain
important drills for

[2:13:00]
important drills for
example uh in a lot of online mtts you
register quite often at the last moment
you get into with 10 big lines is about
33 40% of the field left and you spend a
lot of time as this short stack um so

[2:13:16]
lot of time as this short stack um so
those types of scenarios are actually
quite quite important uh so so I would
just like maybe play a lot of hands and
and try to get some confidence
um again because usually when I haven't
played for a long time I feel like I'm a

[2:13:30]
played for a long time I feel like I'm a
big
Rusty um usually it goes away
immediately once I'm playing poker but I
I always feel like oh I need to I'm not
in the zone as I used to be when I was
just like thinking about poker playing
poker maybe more

[2:13:45]
poker maybe more
intens um so so it's just kind of trying
to get me into a more comfortable
mindset uh
usually um
studying spots that I think are
important uh maybe more than than I than

[2:14:00]
important uh maybe more than than I than
I would if I'm not actively uh playing a
series uh and then in terms of the dayto
day
um I try to to to get enough sleep uh
after the session which is somewhat of a
challenge because you might end your day

[2:14:17]
challenge because you might end your day
at like 4:00 5 a.m. and then there's
stuff happening around the house maybe
wakes up at 7:00 a.m. for example
sometimes need to to bring it to the
daycare uh so you kind of have this
sleep that's kind of
interrupted um which isn't great of

[2:14:32]
interrupted um which isn't great of
course but yeah it is what it is that
that's what happens when you're a poker
player and you you you have family that
needs you
um
uh and then the rest of the day it

[2:14:46]
uh and then the rest of the day it
really depends on if I have any other
obligations in terms of work or maybe
meetings um I try to make do a walk
every day be be out in nature because
yeah you're going to be sitting still
for maybe 10

[2:15:01]
for maybe 10
hours that day so being outside getting
some sun if that's possible just walking
and maybe spending some time away from
screens um is maybe a stable thing I try
to

[2:15:15]
to
do other than that um trying to work out
if that kind of into the
schedule
um
but yeah not other than that maybe yeah

[2:15:30]
but yeah not other than that maybe yeah
not nothing really
like big that I I feel like I need to do
or like has a big impact on my mood or
my
performance um sometimes I do review
like what happened last night in the

[2:15:45]
like what happened last night in the
morning usually will happen with like
key spots or key decisions or or if I'm
not sure about something I might run
like a Sim uh or or review some GTO
Wizards
stuff um but in in that period it's

[2:16:00]
stuff um but in in that period it's
mostly about like playing and and trying
to to be well rested well fit and and be
able to perform again that
evening what have you noticed really
helps increase your performance for
example people are you into meditation

[2:16:17]
example people are you into meditation
we had Mr Von on who would sometimes hop
in a cold shower
uh stuff like that any any any like
performance habits that you noticed that
are helpful for you or maybe any things
that you like to do before you start
playing specifically like a little

[2:16:31]
playing specifically like a little
routine or something that you do in
between breaks that's that's kind of
holy for
you um not not really I mean I've taken
a cold shower once uh or or five or 10
times in my life maybe it's not like a
habit of mine um meditating uh I

[2:16:47]
habit of mine um meditating uh I
sometimes do probably not often enough
because usually when I when I'm finished
meditating I feel really really good but
it's hard to kind of consistently put it
into into my life I would say but it's

[2:17:00]
into into my life I would say but it's
probably a good idea before I would
start playing that uh I do some like 10
15 minute meditation I think it's it's
quite helpful to calm down the mind um I
I've definitely had like live poker
stops usually when I'm when I'm alone

[2:17:16]
stops usually when I'm when I'm alone
and I have more time because sometimes I
bring now the family with me and then
it's it's a whole different experience
than when you're alone on LIF stop you
have a lot more time to prepare uh and
to to have like a morning routine uh I

[2:17:30]
to to have like a morning routine uh I
used to kind of put in a a meditation
session
um but yeah during breaks I usually just
go down uh down the stairs and get some
coffee or get or refill my my cup of
water like walk around a little bit not

[2:17:47]
water like walk around a little bit not
not really nothing special I wish I
could give you a spectacular answer but
it's not the
reality all good all good Adam uh I
would like to actually hand it over to
you with a topic that we discussed but I

[2:18:01]
you with a topic that we discussed but I
had a couple of other question that I
wanted to touch on before we we were
moving on uh we we mentioned a little
bit about the projection bias right
there was something that Peter also
sometimes fall Falls victim to myself
included sure audience can relate as
well any tips around the biases in

[2:18:18]
well any tips around the biases in
general but specifically the projection
me Peter are very curious for your
knowledge I was listening along to that
as well and yeah I think projection bias
first of all you've got to be aware of
it sort of spot it so as P nicely said

[2:18:31]
it sort of spot it so as P nicely said
it's often you think people are thinking
like you and it's watching that kind of
default thought patter and play out and
very often it's realizing that you're
playing an individual a different person
or it's in a relationship and you you
talk to someone who very different
personality to you and spot in what they

[2:18:46]
personality to you and spot in what they
would do differently so uh I think as
you mentioned Peter as well it's r
understand that wait a second like my
default is to uh implant what I would do
in the situation onto them as like a
framework and then to go actually who I
against so as you you mentioned as well

[2:19:01]
against so as you you mentioned as well
Rene here it's very easy against a
recreational player because you was
going through different framing but
someone who's very similar you start to
go into either oh he plays like GTO oh
he might play like me he just watching
that kind of like a lazy thought pattern
to be honest where we just think people

[2:19:15]
to be honest where we just think people
think like us and not realizing we're
against individuals so I think the first
step is to Spot It and the second step
is to really understanding what what is
this person giv you information wise
that allows you to have a different
framing so a different perspective of
this person if it's a recreational

[2:19:30]
this person if it's a recreational
player you're in a different mode
completely if it's another fellow reg
regular you might okay this guy's pretty
good but does he think like me another
thing I see as well is players who like
you mentioned as well have a very
extreme playing style comp comp to the
player pool they assume other players

[2:19:46]
player pool they assume other players
are going to play like them so they go
oh yeah I would Bluff here so he must be
bluffing and you put your style onto
them all they'll see like things like
they'll almost predict that their
opponent can read their minds they're
like oh I'm capped here my opponent will
know I'm capped here therefore I can't

[2:20:00]
know I'm capped here therefore I can't
Bluff in these kind of things so yeah
they just trying to be mindful that we
have a tendency to do this we as as
Peter said as well we often try to put
oursel in someone else's shoes the
problem with that is we're appearing in
their shoes so we often take our mindset

[2:20:15]
their shoes so we often take our mindset
with that so we've got to try to break
past that and also just looking out for
where it appears for you I think a lot
of reflecting on this this is this is
not like a quick fix as as you can
probably realize it's being aware where
do I project onto the people where does
that projection go wrong so you guys
have spoke about biases a lot and I

[2:20:30]
have spoke about biases a lot and I
think it's knowing where your biases
take you off the wrong track where where
do I where does my bias take me in a
direction that leads me to make mistakes
those are the biases that we we really
care about and those the ones that we
need to to pinpoint so yeah when I work
with players on biases I generally get
them to build awareness around their own

[2:20:46]
them to build awareness around their own
biases the situations where they come up
and then trying to come up with
solutions for those situations of when
this happens how can I change the
framing of the situation so I don't go
to my default of projecting what I would
do onto them sometimes it's great other

[2:21:01]
do onto them sometimes it's great other
times it's a it's a big deviation so
yeah it's a work in progress and B are
really tricky just as a thing is uh it's
one of those things we can be aware of
intellectually like Peter talked about
experience versus knowledge bies are
very much in this category we can do a

[2:21:15]
very much in this category we can do a
lot of studying of them but until we
understand for experience where these
biases impact or decision making and we
feel the pain a lot of times and we
start to go wait a second this bias
keeps showing up in this situation and
we work backwards to go how can I

[2:21:30]
we work backwards to go how can I
pinpoint that I think it's yeah it's
going to be patient with that process to
to to unravel
it for you any more biases that we
haven't talked about you did see a
projection bias uh R has opened
Pandora's Box now so any of the biases
that you've noticed for yourself I

[2:21:46]
that you've noticed for yourself I
always feel like intuitive players are
often more prone to bias in in the fact
that they judge they're basing decisions
of how they're feeling in the moment
which is where often biases live any
other kind of biases you've noticed or
have to work through over your

[2:22:00]
have to work through over your
career well I think also maybe uh kind
of a characteristic of biases is usually
that they're not really aware of them uh
if I would be like more aware of the
bias I think I could do some stuff to
kind of uh reduce the impact of it

[2:22:18]
kind of uh reduce the impact of it
um so can really uh give you a clear
answer on that there's probably
definitely wrong assumptions I make
about how opponent play or how I'm uh

[2:22:30]
about how opponent play or how I'm uh
playing certain spots for sure um but I
also feel
like well the these biases it's kind of
like your impressions it's it's the way
you play It's kind of what makes you
your unique uh type of

[2:22:47]
your unique uh type of
player um and it's kind of what what who
you are and what you become or or
basically who who you bring to the table
in that decision- making
process
um and and normally like hopefully uh

[2:23:04]
um and and normally like hopefully uh
you kind of develop this this bias
towards
finding the right play or like your your
biases kind of lead you to does have
always doesn't always have to be
negative right can also lead you to

[2:23:17]
negative right can also lead you to
finding the correct uh adjustment or or
exploit or what you feel like is going
to work the best at the table um and in
terms of yeah being intuitive player I

[2:23:31]
terms of yeah being intuitive player I
think uh this is the case um but this
intuition comes
from uh having seen a lot of spots and
studied the game
um so hopefully if you're like exactly

[2:23:48]
um so hopefully if you're like exactly
replicating what you've studied
uh and not let letting too many biases
creep into that
um hopefully you get you're getting that

[2:24:00]
um hopefully you get you're getting that
right kind of like intuition um but but
of course I think in in in in how we
live our lives and how we make decisions
there's always a lot of subconscious
things coming into that uh we're usually
not really that aware of how our

[2:24:17]
not really that aware of how our
decisions come come to be so I'm sure uh
everyone has these things and it's all
normal part of life so if you experience
them it's not uh the worst

[2:24:30]
them it's not uh the worst
thing yeah it's interesting as you were
speaking there you were almost speaking
about some biases being a strength like
your intuitive reads on players and
developing your own style where bias
leads you to maybe over Bluff under
Bluff spots but it's coming from an
experiential lens of an intuitive reads

[2:24:47]
experiential lens of an intuitive reads
where when I think about biases I often
think about maybe a bit of a blind spot
or something that makes you deviate a
little bit off track but it's
interesting as we can use a positive
bias or a negative whereas I'm Ken of
framan is a negative question whereas

[2:25:00]
framan is a negative question whereas
you instantly went actually I can be
biased towards actions which I think are
are good towards me um yeah I think
biases as you mentioned they're tricky
because I think they come from two main
routes the first is the ego the ego
likes to protect itself it likes to be
right you get things like confirmation

[2:25:15]
right you get things like confirmation
bias short-term gratification which just
all about self- protection I want to be
right I want to be smart don't make me
vulnerable I want to be H correct here
and the second BL um bias comes from
blind spots and blind spots or are the
the brain's shortcuts fast circu in so

[2:25:31]
the brain's shortcuts fast circu in so
anchoring bias we see one piece of
information we have a good first
impression of somebody we're like oh
this person's good oh this hand's strong
and we use a shortcut of the brain to uh
to make information easier to process so
often when we look Downstream of whereby
it comes from it's like it's an ego

[2:25:46]
it comes from it's like it's an ego
protector or it's a blind spot and as
you mentioned earlier awareness of these
is is important and yeah we can almost
certainly have biases towards the good
behaviors or things that lead us to
decisions that through experience and
intuition we've we've molded to make

[2:26:00]
intuition we've we've molded to make
good decisions so for you being an
intuitive player I find a lot of players
who who do play more intuitive style
have to be quite acceptant of mistakes
and I say that because when you're
intuitive you're almost like trusting
yourself to solve problems as they come
up whereas the more logical framework

[2:26:16]
up whereas the more logical framework
have a little bit more of a fallback if
you have a GTO framework and you make a
and go H what do the Sol um I'm okay
where intuitive players can kind of go
more extreme and go one side the other
and they just trust them themselves in
those moments so as you've developed

[2:26:31]
those moments so as you've developed
throughout your career how have you
dealt with making mistakes and been
accepting and moving on from mistakes
throughout your career yeah I don't
think it's necessarily that black and
white between logical and intuitive I
think a lot of the intuition uh comes

[2:26:46]
think a lot of the intuition uh comes
from from logical reasoning or comes
from studying uh
things that make sense um it's just that
the decision comes quite you almost feel
the decision and then you start thinking
about it uh is how it works for

[2:27:01]
about it uh is how it works for
me um so there is definitely something
to fall back on for me like I do put a
lot of faith in in solver outputs and
and um and what we can learn from them
and and how we can like use them to

[2:27:15]
and and how we can like use them to
judge the decision we just
made and often when the two I I made
another decision than what the solver
says there there is some Gap to bridge
between why this happened and maybe it

[2:27:30]
between why this happened and maybe it
was the correct play
right solver doesn't always make the
correct play uh exactly in game or
against certain players or against the
population so but it at least asks the
question it's at least something where

[2:27:45]
question it's at least something where
you can compare your own uh decision
against and that's is like a base to
kind of figure out the problem after it
has happened in preparation for the next
similar problem that happens in the
future um and in terms of dealing with

[2:28:02]
future um and in terms of dealing with
mistakes um it's it's mostly about
accepting that you're going to make them
thinking about how can I avoid making
mistakes in the future or or lessen the
impact of my mistakes I think that's
also a

[2:28:15]
also a
big uh Cornerstone of my game is that I
try to
make if if I make mistakes try to make
them as small as possible so that they
don't have a huge impact on my um on my
Roi or my EV I think I do some things

[2:28:32]
Roi or my EV I think I do some things
really well better than than other
players and I probably do some other
stuff worse than than the other players
if I can kind of minimize the the impact
of the things I'm doing worse but I can
keep building on my

[2:28:46]
keep building on my
strengths um then there will be more e
coming from those strong areas of my
game uh where if I'm trying to lessen
the impact of of
mistakes it doesn't cut too much into

[2:29:00]
mistakes it doesn't cut too much into
this EV generated by those those strong
areas so that's kind of how I'm viewing
mistakes something inevitable but also
something that you you can work on to
try to eliminate or try to avoid making

[2:29:15]
try to eliminate or try to avoid making
and it it there's always some
disappointment when you realize hey I
made it clear clear mistake here uh
where maybe I I could have solved it uh
but there's
also uh you're also somewhat thankful

[2:29:30]
also uh you're also somewhat thankful
making a mistake and being able to
realize it because you're probably not
going to make it in the future again if
you're doing it well you you actually
learn from from your
mistakes yeah as he mentioned they
inevitable I think that's a really good

[2:29:46]
inevitable I think that's a really good
word to use with mistakes because no
matter how good you get a poker you
never going to uh be a perfect version
of poker player who never makes mistakes
you also mentioned minimizing which as
you you're trying to navigate decision-
making trying to avoid big mistakes and

[2:30:01]
making trying to avoid big mistakes and
big custy blenders but then also KN a
mistake as a learning opportunity so
we've got like three things kind of
coming together there which kind of give
a nice framework of how to accept
mistakes better they are inevitable you
don't to try and minimize them without
doing that completely and then they do

[2:30:15]
doing that completely and then they do
happen you can learn from them I think
that's one of the harsh realities of
life isn't it that we learn more from
mistakes than we do from successes and
imagine like if you had no feedback from
failure I'm sure some people could
progress well but a lot of us we need
those kind of failure points to go oh
mistake that I can improve this area and

[2:30:32]
mistake that I can improve this area and
the mistakes are like the the flashing
light of work to be done work to improve
on over time that leads to a better
version of yourself so yeah good stuff I
also like how you push back on that kind
of intuition versus logic and there
isn't like a clear winner it's like a
interaction between the two I thought it

[2:30:45]
interaction between the two I thought it
was a a nice way you phrase that CU I
think it's a accurate representation of
how we're Mak the decisions we might
have a stronger preference towards one
but we're constantly logically working
through stuff as well as using some sort
of intuitive read coming from a maybe
larger subconscious conscious data set

[2:31:00]
larger subconscious conscious data set
all right you've had a long career so I
do want to do a bit of reflecting on
that Journey you've had what would you
say has been the greatest contributor to
your success in
podcast
um I would say probably it's also a bit

[2:31:15]
um I would say probably it's also a bit
of an an natural Talent or or maybe uh
just
um interest for for games interest for
um problem
solving
um I was always uh interested in in in

[2:31:32]
um I was always uh interested in in in
strategy games for example I think from
a young age playing uh strategy games
um it kind of gave me the perfect uh
learning route even from a young age

[2:31:46]
learning route even from a young age
kind of preparing me for these types of
uh High imp strategic decisions that you
make in
poker um I really
think playing strategic video games is
probably like what was the best

[2:32:00]
probably like what was the best
preparation for me uh and kind of what
led me to do well or kind
of um yeah made me made me uh set up to
be to be maybe a player that that was

[2:32:16]
be to be maybe a player that that was
able to improve fast or progress fast I
think
um the things we do as a child have have
a big impact on who we are as an adult
and
um yeah from from when I was like four

[2:32:31]
um yeah from from when I was like four
five six year old um I I was um playing
these games like Age of Empires and U
Pokemon game boy games and all that kind
of stuff and I think it it really helped
me just um develop a lot for games and

[2:32:49]
me just um develop a lot for games and
for strategic decision making uh while
also when my mind was still young kind
of uh develop these these ways of
thinking or these these Frameworks of of

[2:33:01]
thinking or these these Frameworks of of
how you should approach uh
problems uh in that way and then I I
think I guess uh with the the studies I
did um them being bit mathematical in

[2:33:17]
did um them being bit mathematical in
nature uh also kind of
developed my mind in I think the right
way as well or was like a good
complimentary thing to be doing next to
Poker because was also quite
intellectually challenging in a

[2:33:30]
intellectually challenging in a
different way
um I think maybe had a combination of
those two things uh that are maybe not
always present in
everyone
um they they're probably kind of uh a

[2:33:45]
um they they're probably kind of uh a
big part of of My
Success uh other than kind of probably
being uh more
lucky on average I think also there's a
lot of survivorship bias in poker um so

[2:34:00]
lot of survivorship bias in poker um so
definitely want to be aware of that as
well
uh but I think that's maybe applicable
to to most people
so what would you say are some skills or
character traits you've had to learn on
the job you mentioned these kind of

[2:34:15]
the job you mentioned these kind of
preempting skills and childhood
experiences that set you up well what
are some things that you had to learn
through experience while as
plan
um I think of course the the mental Game
of Poker and how you develop and dealing

[2:34:31]
of Poker and how you develop and dealing
with with with losses and all that kind
of stuff
um I guess uh winning and losing money
was was kind of new uh compared to to
other games

[2:34:46]
other games
um other than that yeah well
uh of course poker teaches you unique
skills unique experiences um can't
really
pinpoint
uh that other than then basically yeah

[2:35:01]
uh that other than then basically yeah
just just um learn how to play poker
well learn how to deal with uh swings uh
learn how to to fit poker into your
overall life uh learn what what place uh

[2:35:16]
overall life uh learn what what place uh
it takes what you get out of it why why
you do it
um that kind of stuff
um yeah maybe it it g gave me some uh

[2:35:31]
um yeah maybe it it g gave me some uh
some more confidence as
well in in finding some type
of identity and
success
um you know realizing your go you set a
goal for yourself realizing it uh that

[2:35:48]
goal for yourself realizing it uh that
does give you some satisfaction some
confidence
some um sense of accomplishment and
achievement that that really helps with
happiness and all that kind of stuff
so yeah poker has been uh been great and

[2:36:02]
so yeah poker has been uh been great and
I'm really happy with the place that it
has been able to to take in my
life yeah one topic we've touched on but
not went as deep as I would like is
around patience and I think for you

[2:36:15]
around patience and I think for you
you've obviously worked hard for a long
period of time right now you're probably
towards the Pinnacle of your PO career
is very easy to think that success has
come easy and I know a lot of players
struggle when they have periods of many
years of not living up to their
potential or what they feel like they

[2:36:31]
potential or what they feel like they
could do I think a lot of things if
you're good at something you see a lot
more direct feedback especially like if
you're very good at sport you often win
stuff in poker especially mtts as you
mentioned there's a lot of variance lot
of luck and you might just have really

[2:36:46]
of luck and you might just have really
high dreams and aspirations but not hit
those for a long time I feel like for
you just listen to your story it feels
like you've been able to instill a lot
of patience whilst being driven working
towards goals I think that's an
underrated quality where other players

[2:37:00]
underrated quality where other players
might get overly frustrated or give up
on their Pursuits so for you how have
you uh thought about patience or how how
do you feel that you've been able to
cultivate patience to uh stick the
course even when things haven't been
going your
way yeah I just think um I wasn't that

[2:37:15]
way yeah I just think um I wasn't that
focused on on on results most of the
time and just really the enjoyed playing
enjoyed
improving um and try to make the best
decisions at the table and seeing what
what came from that and uh not being too

[2:37:31]
what came from that and uh not being too
focused on on like res the result and
and all the financial stuff that maybe
comes with it trying having like
Financial pressure to to perform or
maybe being in in makeup for some people
and having to grind that back not having

[2:37:46]
and having to grind that back not having
all this outside pressure uh on on your
poker playing I think uh is
definitely yeah it can be definitely
detrimental to your motivation to play
uh and in your ability to perform so um

[2:38:03]
uh and in your ability to perform so um
yeah there was patience involved for
sure
um not that I felt like uh I was waiting
for something I was just uh playing and

[2:38:16]
for something I was just uh playing and
improving and uh trying to achieve stuff
and sometimes it took longer for me
um but yeah I mean that's that's it how
it is for some um and I'm kind of

[2:38:30]
it is for some um and I'm kind of
grateful for for that in the end because
it it made me kind of strive to be
better all the time instead of having a
big achievement and then kind of resting
on your laurels because You' you've just
gotten it
yeah yeah I think it's trying to get

[2:38:46]
yeah yeah I think it's trying to get
that balance right between trying to
improve trying to make progress trying
to become a better version then try and
then trying to align that with a goal
that's the direction for that so I'm
curious to know with you what have been
some of the uh bigger goals that have

[2:39:00]
some of the uh bigger goals that have
taken a long time to reach over your
career that you've set as a Target in
your progression in your growth path
that when you got there it was a nice
moment or it was a a long path to get
there yeah for MTD player usually
there's just going to be uh a big score

[2:39:16]
there's just going to be uh a big score
in terms of uh uh t with a high Buy in
or with a high price pull uh and then a
satisfactory end to the tournaments I
think I've been quite blessed with if I
make final table I usually have a quite

[2:39:32]
make final table I usually have a quite
good placement I quite a lot of first
places when you compare them to how many
final tables I I kind of make but maybe
I'm not that often making a final table
but when I make it I usually have have a
good result um terms of Triton final

[2:39:47]
good result um terms of Triton final
tables for example I think I've made
three and i' I've won two so that's
that's an exceptional
result
um yeah winning a tournament is really
the goal um well not not really uh in

[2:40:03]
the goal um well not not really uh in
ter well it's the ultimate achievement
um but the goal is usually to just make
the best decisions and get the the spot
in the tournament that that you well
that that you basically get that that

[2:40:15]
that that you basically get that that
just happens right it's it's uh you make
good decisions and then
um bars fall in a certain way and either
you're still in or you're out and you
can't really influence that too
much um but yeah winning a tournament is

[2:40:31]
much um but yeah winning a tournament is
of course the the ultimate satisfactory
uh moment as a poker player and uh as an
MTT player and just those two Triton
wins um they were very big in terms of
the score itself and then the whole

[2:40:47]
the score itself and then the whole
atmosphere around it um
yeah it's it's just very nice uh to have
people back at home rail you support you
all that kind of stuff is is really nice
at a

[2:41:01]
at a
benefit what makes the Triton stops so
special it seems like a lot of high St
players really have them as the Pinnacle
of their year at the moment what is it
about the the whole Triton experience
which you feel is is different from
other high

[2:41:16]
other high
tournaments yeah just really the focus
uh on high storment in the first place
then the the level of execution and then
just the attention to detail the quality
of the competition uh that they organize
is just very very good also the fields

[2:41:32]
is just very very good also the fields
are just a nice mix of uh really good
players mixed in
with uh more recreational players that
that just want to compete that that uh
have a lot of money as well so there's
there's for us uh regulars this this

[2:41:47]
there's for us uh regulars this this
quite quite quite um a bit to be made I
would say there's also tournaments every
day starting it's just a nice grind like
one tournament's done doesn't matter

[2:42:00]
one tournament's done doesn't matter
tomorrow there there's going to be
another one uh very often you're able to
register
into day two or the late registration
ends very late at night so you're kind
of constantly
playing um and every tournament feels

[2:42:15]
playing um and every tournament feels
like a new chance uh it's just yeah it's
really nice uh experience for sure I I
it's my favorite stop and one where I've
also had like uh some some really big
success so for me it has a special place

[2:42:30]
success so for me it has a special place
in my heart for sure nice yeah it seems
to be the the big aspirational goal for
a lot of the spire and poker players now
they've done a very good job of
marketing it as a pinnacle experience
something to strive for maybe even more
than any other events as i' say at the

[2:42:45]
than any other events as i' say at the
moment so yeah it sounds like your
experience has correlated with that as
well which is was really nice what would
you say is the one thing poker has
brought you that you didn't expect
getting into poker 17 years
ago well I I never really expected I

[2:43:01]
ago well I I never really expected I
guess to make it this far
um or yeah or or travel as much as as
I've done uh for those live
tournaments uh I'm not sure I really
thought too much

[2:43:16]
thought too much
about the future or how I would would be
playing poker in the future I definitely
wasn't thinking there was going to be a
tournament player for
example
um yeah I really appreciate also the
people you meet through through poker uh

[2:43:33]
people you meet through through poker uh
for example at Triton Monaco there were
a couple of old school poker Legends I I
want to call them uh that that have
since moved on to other things

[2:43:45]
since moved on to other things
uh that are now coming back because they
were successful at that other thing they
have a lot of money they they start
playing poker again and it's just uh
nice to meet like smart people um have
have interesting conversations uh I

[2:44:00]
have interesting conversations uh I
think that for me is also a kind of
underrated uh benefit of of the
situation that I'm currently in that
it's just a nice atmosphere of of good
chill people um and and you see them

[2:44:15]
chill people um and and you see them
every stop and you you improve your
relationship slowly over time sometimes
you're by chance seated next to someone
that you get to know better um or not
and so it's it's kind of this mix of
Randomness in in what your experience is

[2:44:30]
Randomness in in what your experience is
going to be like is is all is also like
really nice you never know what you're
GNA get in you don't know which
tournaments you're going to do well in
if you're going to do well in a
tournament not sure who you're GNA play
with who you're gonna what's G to happen
and I think maybe that's like um one of

[2:44:48]
and I think maybe that's like um one of
the things that attracts people the most
to Poker and maybe Ghost type of
tournament stops specifically is that
it's just a kind of a uh bag of mystery

[2:45:01]
it's just a kind of a uh bag of mystery
that you kind of open
consciously um and you kind of let it uh
come over you and and see see what comes
out of there and for me I've definitely
been blessed uh with some very good runs
in these these tournaments so that's

[2:45:15]
in these these tournaments so that's
that's
nice I'm sure I've just inspired some M
players to want to play the Trident if
they weren't already aiming for that
because that was a very yeah very nice
way to put it and uh it sounds like the
overall experience is something that
many players who would have aspirations

[2:45:30]
many players who would have aspirations
of getting to that stage would would
would enjoy as well reney would you ever
fancy doing one of the Triton
stops interesting question I mean over
the years I've got a more and more

[2:45:45]
the years I've got a more and more
respect for entities and how complex
they are and how easy it is for cash
game players to overestimate their skill
because all my skills are basically
worth very little when when the moment
basically when when the EVS start to to

[2:46:00]
basically when when the EVS start to to
be made you know at the shortest stack
ICM final tables I mean I'm I'm clueless
like I recent I think actually I think
it was the last life event I played I
did actually final table and I reviewed
it afterwards I thought I played pretty
well to be fair I think throughout the

[2:46:15]
well to be fair I think throughout the
tournament I played very well because
throughout the tournament you especially
the live poker the event that I was
playing it usually has a decent average
stch size so I don't get in too much
very short te scenarios and I do
obviously understand some things about
short Zack but obviously not to the

[2:46:31]
short Zack but obviously not to the
level where I could compete in a Triton
right this was a uni bet open so a 1K
buying so the average level is just
going to be low so I'm pretty confident
that I'm going to be uh one of the
better players regardless of not having
the experience in mtts but then when it

[2:46:45]
the experience in mtts but then when it
came to the final table and I reviewed
it with an MTT player there was that a
whole different philosophy like I was
trying to get in there and he said no no
no you shouldn't be in there you should
just fold so the other guy shelves
because then he's going to bust more so
basically by you
opening uh you've now eliminated the

[2:47:00]
opening uh you've now eliminated the
chance of him busting by x% I was like
huh never heard thought about that so
you know there's there are so many
things you know and like ICM like I was
I understand some Basics like like Peter
explained I understand the value of your
stack goes up etc etc but you know

[2:47:16]
stack goes up etc etc but you know
obviously nowhere to the level of nuance
needed to be uh profitable in in those
fields so while I think
definitely uh looking at it like I said
they marked it very well that even for
me look at it like next would be pretty

[2:47:30]
me look at it like next would be pretty
cool to play um I don't think I have the
necessary skills to be to be playing
that right now and in order to get the
skills I need to dedicate quite some
time which I'm currently not really
interested in dedicating to uh then if I

[2:47:45]
interested in dedicating to uh then if I
would play them for fun I mean I think
the lowest one is 25k if I'm not mist
taking uh yeah it's pretty expensive
just for fun I mean honestly if I just
compare it to okay what what what would
be like my Roi how much would I actually
lose so if I think about it in those

[2:48:00]
lose so if I think about it in those
terms they like okay you know I'm
willing to you know I I don't even know
how much I would be losing but uh let's
say
it's I have no clue but let's say it's
10% so paying 2.5k for the experience I
mean I went on holidays for 2.5k so if I

[2:48:15]
mean I went on holidays for 2.5k so if I
compare it to the holiday but obviously
you know
that's over the long term I'm sorry like
a fish right expl they say yeah but
that's in the long term I hate these
discussions uh but yeah obviously in the
short term it would just be a 25k uh
investment so no you won't see me uh

[2:48:32]
investment so no you won't see me uh
anytime soon playing uh most likely
unless you know one of our sponsors like
hey wo we like you let's put you in the
tournament you know but no not not not
not a big chance of me showing up but I
do really appreciate what they're doing
for poker and how how they make it

[2:48:46]
for poker and how how they make it
exciting and yeah it's it's just it's
it's just amazing to watch uh yeah very
very very excited uh about that um I
want to talk a little bit about more
about your other Interest next to Poker
and your businesses that you run you run

[2:49:02]
and your businesses that you run you run
a couple of software development
businesses I'm curious about which poker
skills you think transitioned well into
business uh yeah what what kind of
skills did you develop in poker that
that helped you succeed in business

[2:49:19]
that helped you succeed in business
H yeah just decision making I guess and
um U yeah having a framework or or
knowing which uh things are important to

[2:49:30]
knowing which uh things are important to
make decisions which factor in
um in po making decisions in business is
kind of uh kind of the
same um just analyzing situations

[2:49:46]
same um just analyzing situations
analyzing the market
um finding kind of a competitive Niche
uh is is
is yeah it I'm not sure the overlap in

[2:50:00]
is yeah it I'm not sure the overlap in
business and poker is that that big
[Music]
Um poker you do kind of on your own
without too many at least I've done this
mostly on my own this maybe big
difference between some other uh players
who usually have like more of a group

[2:50:16]
who usually have like more of a group
around them for me Po has been more of a
solo activity especially the last few
years whereas in business there's only
that that much you can kind of achieve
on your own and you're starting a
company like okay you can have the idea

[2:50:31]
company like okay you can have the idea
you can have a whole blueprint but then
you're going to have to find people that
you can convince of your vision and can
help you execute on uh on it so uh it's
it's more about people it's uh it's

[2:50:46]
it's more about people it's uh it's
about communicating your vision clearly
to those people and uh and having them
efficiently work on
it um so for me it is quite uh quite
different um I would say poker is is

[2:51:00]
different um I would say poker is is
actually a lot easier to spend time on
it's just more naturally
entertaining um whereas business or or
working on my companies uh
feels uh feels more like sometimes

[2:51:15]
feels uh feels more like sometimes
chores that need to be done in order to
have them ACH machine run
smoothly
um but yeah I mean it's certainly very
very uh very interesting and and um a

[2:51:30]
very uh very interesting and and um a
big challenge of mine to we're now
building a software product I don't want
to dive too too deep in it necessarily
because I don't think it matters too
much but uh just seeing how that all
comes together
um and and kind of being the head of a

[2:51:47]
um and and kind of being the head of a
team
uh it's it's a nice experience to have
it's it's nice to have options outside
of Poker to be able to do something
intellectually stimulating that is not

[2:52:00]
intellectually stimulating that is not
just a poker hand always and to just
have like a different thing to to put
time and energy in is is yeah I'm really
grateful that I've been able to to
cultivate something like that in my life
as

[2:52:15]
as
well I can relate in terms of transition
in away from poker I think you also
mentioned earlier in the composition
basically putting you in a situation
where there's an opportunity for growth
also in a different direction right than
just thinking about poker hands um it's
interesting that you also mentioned that

[2:52:31]
interesting that you also mentioned that
while I think poker players are very
skilled in one area they can be very
lack a lot of skill in a different area
I I met a I met a friend of mine who was
doing an NBA in uh in Rotterdam he he's
a project manager works for like a big
consultancy firm and I worked together

[2:52:46]
consultancy firm and I worked together
with him uh on the business a little bit
and he said it's really interesting that
I can have very high level conversations
with you but sometimes it's like I'm
talking to a [ __ ] baby you know it's
like because I I've I've specialized you
know we learned into a very specific
direction if you have you noticed

[2:53:00]
direction if you have you noticed
something similar in in in your business
where like people are like oh I can
level very high with you here but then
other levels like come on the average
employee would do this better you know
yeah definitely because I I'm I've
worked with with uh guys that have just

[2:53:15]
worked with with uh guys that have just
after they completed their studies they
went on to work for an employer so they
have a lot more experience in in
software development for example and
luckily they've brought that experience
uh with them and and they've had that
input to to to our company and and to do

[2:53:31]
input to to to our company and and to do
the product so that's obviously great
but definitely some things that I I
didn't learn or didn't know because I I
was just wasn't uh wasn't doing what
they were doing um and it's always been
for me this bit of a duality uh in my

[2:53:46]
for me this bit of a duality uh in my
identity as a poker player and my
achievements as a poker player uh and
then what I've been doing next to that
whether it was uh doing these uh
University studies or now uh doing

[2:54:01]
University studies or now uh doing
several several companies actually um
it's a it's it's it's like your identity
is not really that clearly defined like
are you a poker player are you a you
know
entrepreneur

[2:54:16]
entrepreneur
um because you have to split your time
between the two and sometimes it feels
like you're you're both and sometimes it
feels like you're you're none of them
you know it's it's uh it's tough
sometimes I would think just focusing on

[2:54:32]
sometimes I would think just focusing on
one thing is is is like it's easier or
it's less complex or it's the path to
what you want to do or need to do is way
more clear where now it's it's it's um

[2:54:46]
more clear where now it's it's it's um
there's always this thing I can fall
back on the other part or if if I feel
like I'm not succeeding at one area um
there's always at other area in my life
that I can feel well feel good about or
or I can get some form of satisfaction

[2:55:02]
or I can get some form of satisfaction
from or Achieve Financial success in
um that can be dangerous because it can
kind of uh demotivate you to excel at
one or the other um but I mean for now

[2:55:16]
one or the other um but I mean for now
it's it's been going quite all right for
me
uh and we we I'm doing well on both
fronts so U well there has been a
struggle um I feel like currently at
this moment
um uh yeah I'm I'm really happy with

[2:55:32]
um uh yeah I'm I'm really happy with
having opportunity
to to well try to achieve something
great in in both
Fields I guess you know like obviously
in business just like in poker setbacks
are inevitable so having already dealt

[2:55:45]
are inevitable so having already dealt
with setbacks in poker and dealt with
losses that that definitely gives you a
very big asch I think to other
entrepreneurs who may be just starting
out you know and who don't have the
similar experience also F actually was
talking with this with someone else
maybe you have a similar experience if
you also do other things next to poker

[2:56:00]
you also do other things next to poker
poker becomes a great procrastinator
have you noticed this as well basically
because poker is so dop dopamine
stimulating that other tasks often can
feel boring and then poker is like you
do something but you should actually be
doing other tests but you can tell
yourself that you're being productive

[2:56:16]
yourself that you're being productive
right because you're playing poker but
it's just like uh it's just a great
procrastinator because you get your
dopamine and have have you noticed
anything similar yeah yeah for sure that
that definitely comes into effect uh I
don't want to call it an escape

[2:56:30]
don't want to call it an escape
necessarily but it always feels like
okay I go on a live trip for two weeks
um I know the company is in good hands
like uh the development process is is
being taken care of quite professionally
but it's it's still like okay don't want

[2:56:45]
but it's it's still like okay don't want
to call it an excuse but it's like
because it's poker because it's about uh
high stakes and and and it's probably
quite also makes decent income probably
or EV it's like important to do or it's

[2:57:00]
or EV it's like important to do or it's
worth to do and and it it becomes this
this thing that's that's worth it or
that it's um it's okay to sacrifice
something else for whereas if that
wasn't the case I guess uh I wouldn't be

[2:57:15]
wasn't the case I guess uh I wouldn't be
able to kind of get away with it for
myself and maybe even for my my
environment as well so it definitely
like you said I can relate to that uh
the the the trill or the dopamine you
get from poker is uh I don't want to NE

[2:57:31]
get from poker is uh I don't want to NE
necessarily call it addicting but it's
it's um unique and um other type of
activities don't necessarily come close
so so um it's easy to fall back on for

[2:57:45]
so so um it's easy to fall back on for
sure yeah
you uh you mentioned that when you're at
the stop you know that the company is in
good hands obviously in order to do the
amount of things that you do you need to
delegate and find the right people
something that you mentioned uh could
you maybe give some tips around uh

[2:58:01]
you maybe give some tips around uh
effectively delegating and uh I think I
heard the terms for once working less in
your business but on your business so I
guess that that you could probably
relate to that and how to find the right
people yeah so most of the people that

[2:58:16]
people yeah so most of the people that
I'm working with in uh in the projects
I'm doing they're actually guys that I
know from University so I know them also
unlike um I would say a personal level
um and after that other people joined

[2:58:31]
um and after that other people joined
that I I maybe uh no know less
personally um so for me I just had to
look in my uh group of friends I would
would would say it because a lot of them

[2:58:47]
would would say it because a lot of them
they also come from Computer Science
Background our
developers um was fortunate to to give
them the opportunity to come come work
with
me um and then it's mostly about

[2:59:00]
me um and then it's mostly about
communicating your vision or what you
want to do or what you want to achieve
from a from a business point of view
from a commercial
standpoint to uh the technical people
that are then in charge of
building the product um and and it's

[2:59:17]
building the product um and and it's
really articulation of that Vision that
is really important because I'm the
domain expert I know what I want to to
achieve and want to build for them
they're like more the experts at

[2:59:30]
they're like more the experts at
building and not necessarily at the the
domain or the environment that they will
be operating in so it's it's for me to
explain them hey you will be you could
maybe compare it to like a Navy SEAL or
something that's like very uh adaptable

[2:59:45]
something that's like very uh adaptable
and able to uh perform in in all types
of situations and then before he goes on
a mission I'm the guy preparing him with
like all the Intel all the information
you're going to be in in this type of
environment this is your mission this is

[3:00:00]
environment this is your mission this is
what you want to do this is how how I
would guide you through it but then um
they're actually going to be the ones uh
executing on on the task
um with with me like kind of monitoring

[3:00:15]
um with with me like kind of monitoring
and seeing seeing uh uh seeing the the
the work as they're kind of doing it but
more from like an organizational
standpoint not really in
that um actively working on development

[3:00:30]
that um actively working on development
because there were some times where like
they do they're doing daily meetings at
9:00 a.m. for example yeah when you're
sleeping until 4:5 you're going to bed
at 4: 5 a.m. getting up for like a daily
scrum meeting of only 50 minutes where

[3:00:45]
scrum meeting of only 50 minutes where
just sinking with each other uh it's
just you you don't really have the
energy or or it's also just not
productive for them or for your poker uh
performance
so um we've gotten to this point where

[3:01:02]
so um we've gotten to this point where
there's kind of a a nice divide in in
what the development team is doing and
what I'm doing in the
company yeah I like it you have a team
of Navy Seals and then in the morning

[3:01:16]
of Navy Seals and then in the morning
they they catch up and like where
where's the bus oh the bus the bus
played poker until last night till late
last night so he can't go to the
car that's good stuff you you mentioned
your your your uh your your de your

[3:01:30]
your your your uh your your de your
software development companies uh I saw
you you are the CEO co-founder of
everblue Finance specialized in digital
asset growth in general you're
passionate about anything digital web
free metaverse where do you see the
future of these things going and how do

[3:01:46]
future of these things going and how do
you see it impacting
ER yeah so these are all very
interesting Technologies indeed like
blockchain and smart contracts are like
two of the main technologies that we're
using in the company um I think it's

[3:02:01]
using in the company um I think it's
definitely the future it's like a
alternative way to to operate uh
Information Technology infrastructure
usually uh We've also always had like
trusted middlemen or um application s

[3:02:18]
trusted middlemen or um application s
that that service like social media
they're usually like using it a server
side model where the server has all the
information everyone's connecting to the
server but you don't really see what's
running on the server or how your data

[3:02:30]
running on the server or how your data
is handled I think that's kind of a a
broken model and I think there's a a
better alternative for that of course
we're in still in a very experimental
stage and very nent stage of of these uh
new technologies but they fascinate me

[3:02:47]
new technologies but they fascinate me
for for multiple reasons um I think they
just uh have the ability to bring more
freedom not only Financial Freedom but
just Freedom of Information and and um
yeah just a better experience better

[3:03:01]
yeah just a better experience better
infrastructure to To The World At Large
and
um yeah it's it's been a just really
always been curious and always been
passionately following this technology

[3:03:15]
passionately following this technology
space I'm just happy that I can uh have
a company now that that that does
something with this um that's able to
contribute something because I really
feel like we're we're doing
something uh really bleeding with

[3:03:30]
something uh really bleeding with
bleeding edge technology
like there are many software companies
in the world of course some doing
something very boring or something very
easy I would almost call it um whereas
we're really trying to invent um kind of

[3:03:47]
we're really trying to invent um kind of
a new Al gthm or a new way of of doing
things with technology that's that's
really new as well so it's it's very uh
stimulating and exciting to be to be to
be working with this type of uh

[3:04:01]
be working with this type of uh
technology how do you see uh the future
of Poker yourself in it and how do you
see these type of Technologies impact
the future of
Poker yeah you you already see kind of
uh poker s sites kind of integrating

[3:04:17]
uh poker s sites kind of integrating
stable coins or doing their random
number J random number generator on
chain I'm not sure if I think there's
that much value in all in in in the
second part um but certainly for

[3:04:30]
second part um but certainly for
payments I think stable coins uh are
very beneficial for for gambling
sites
um yeah there will definitely be
experiments and there will definitely be

[3:04:46]
experiments and there will definitely be
you can also do some stuff with nfds I
think Tron at some point it's some form
of NFD thing as well there's going to be
people are going to try new things
[Music]
um yeah we'll have to see because a lot

[3:05:02]
um yeah we'll have to see because a lot
of these Technologies they they hold lot
of Promise do they materialize like meta
ver is a good good example of okay the
the idea is there the idea actually has
been around for for a couple of decades
already but really where the mainstream

[3:05:16]
already but really where the mainstream
people are are using this technology
it's not there yet but I'm sure virtual
reality metaverse ai ai integration all
that kind of stuff is going to have
their impact on on poker
too

[3:05:32]
too
um but it's it's always hard to to
predict the future or to to to even
reason about the future because I think
if I would see a meaningful way for
these types of Technologies now to

[3:05:47]
these types of Technologies now to
improve poker or to integrate with poker
I I might be the one building uh those
type of uh of uh applications
so
um I'm not sure but I'm definitely I'm

[3:06:02]
um I'm not sure but I'm definitely I'm
pretty sure that there will be impact
and we see it slowly with stable coins
becoming a a great medium of exchange
for for poker sites uh just gives a lot
of flexibility to poker players and it's
in those areas where it has like

[3:06:16]
in those areas where it has like
immediate benefits for people uh I think
poker Community has always been quick to
adopt uh these new technologies
um yeah it's definitely a net positive

[3:06:31]
um yeah it's definitely a net positive
uh for for Humanity and and I really
believe in them even though there's a
lot of doubt and a lot of
um yeah even even the sector itself
digital asset space is is is kind of a

[3:06:46]
digital asset space is is is kind of a
clouded area where you have small things
like a small area that that produces a
lot of value and then there's a lot of
cowboys and uh snake oil salesmen that
try to profit from the the Greet of

[3:07:02]
try to profit from the the Greet of
others and that's also ongoing and then
people from the outside looking in they
only see the bad stuff and and kind of
let their own buyas creep in um that has
been very interesting to observe uh

[3:07:16]
been very interesting to observe uh
especially also having a bit of a more
more technical background and being to
able to understand these systems and
comparing them to what we saw in in
school and how Legacy infrastructure
operates and works it gives you another

[3:07:31]
operates and works it gives you another
dimension to to understand everything
and it's definitely next to Poker also
like a passion of mine for
sure like the future is going to change
a lot right compared to how we know it

[3:07:46]
a lot right compared to how we know it
now and that's basically ever growing
like technology grows faster and faster
how does that
impact uh more of a personal curiosity
question how does it impact in how you
want to raise your your

[3:08:00]
want to raise your your
children and like for example quotequote
Traditional School Systems and stuff
like that I hear uh you know I felt like
some influencers that are like no we're
not going to put our kid in traditional
schools because you know they're
prepareing for something that may may
not be there in the future anymore or

[3:08:16]
not be there in the future anymore or
that may not be something that they
believe in or how they've achieved
success how do you see that in terms of
parenting your your your children going
forward in the future that's unnown and
fastly changing because for example I
could prepare my daughter for a job

[3:08:31]
could prepare my daughter for a job
that's not no longer there in 20 years
for example yeah it's ConEd as
here now of course like it's still going
to be quite far out until they really
have to make like a decision for for a
job U but I guess looking at elementary

[3:08:46]
job U but I guess looking at elementary
school when when they're like five six
years old uh by then I think um AI will
have progressed even further and
hopefully I I'm pretty sure there's
going to be technology that will help
people or children learn or going to be

[3:09:01]
people or children learn or going to be
like their AI buddy or assistant that
they're going to chat with um about and
and about learning stuff and that that
it's kind of uh assists them with uh
with learning or or teaches them like in

[3:09:16]
with learning or or teaches them like in
a playful way about things I'm not sure
if the school system is goingon to be
adjusted to these types of things uh
usually
um it probably will be quite expensive

[3:09:30]
um it probably will be quite expensive
and usually it's a very slow ship to to
change course uh the education system at
least here in Belgium probably it's
going to be more the private sector
right that's going to be fastly fastly
adopting and like I don't know how that
works in Belgium but probably similar to

[3:09:46]
works in Belgium but probably similar to
denans if you want the government it has
to go through controls and then it has
to be regulated to all schools uh before
we there you
know yeah so I think that might be very
slow um but I think it's up to us as

[3:10:01]
slow um but I think it's up to us as
parents to kind of give them these tools
and to outside of school kind of
stimulate them to to work with uh things
that are good for their development uh I
I mostly look at school for for other uh
things more as like learning to to deal

[3:10:17]
things more as like learning to to deal
with authoritative figures and having
multiple authoritative figures in their
life and also just
socially uh develop as a person make
friends um I think those two are going

[3:10:30]
friends um I think those two are going
to end up being like the most important
reasons why to send U children to public
school and maybe School uh the education
system does have to change a little bit
to kind of uh more accommodate those
needs or those um things for children

[3:10:48]
needs or those um things for children
and outside of that I think being able
to to keep up with the latest technology
yourself and then equipping your child
with them so that it's able to like
learn uh things because for

[3:11:03]
learn uh things because for
most I think most people that kind of
exceed at something or that if you want
if if you want an advantage in life it's
usually not going to come from from
school necessarily it comes from school

[3:11:16]
school necessarily it comes from school
plus something outside you're being
stimulated or you're being for example
your parent teaches you chess for
example and that means like
maybe yeah just the the the the
beneficial effects of problem solving on

[3:11:32]
beneficial effects of problem solving on
the mind of a young child that kind of
leads to like this compounding effect
later in life um so I think it's up to
us as parents to kind
of um if we see the educational system

[3:11:46]
of um if we see the educational system
is lacking a certain way or not
providing what we think can be provided
there's plenty of time for us as parents
to kind of uh supplement that uh in the
time that they're home or or maybe

[3:12:00]
time that they're home or or maybe
there's like maybe the they there's not
really the possibility I guess to go
part-time to school but that would
probably even in an Ideal World be the
case
where um you do some form of
homeschooling

[3:12:15]
homeschooling
or yeah I haven't really given this too
much thought
um but but I am convinced that the
optimal way of teaching children and
preparing children for things later in

[3:12:30]
preparing children for things later in
life is going to change a lot I just
don't think the education systems are
going to adapt fast enough to that and
it's going to be up to
us um if we want our children to have an
advantage or to be better adapted I

[3:12:45]
advantage or to be better adapted I
guess yeah I I I I completely agree with
what you said like I see the same in
terms of at least Elementary School like
yeah they need to learn how to read
write deal with authority make friends
like being I think your main job as a
parent I think I heard uh uh Jordan

[3:13:02]
parent I think I heard uh uh Jordan
Peterson say that your main job as a
parent is to make your kids socially
accepted by the a of four he said
because if if they're not socially
accepted by the AE of four it's a very
slippery down downhill from there so
that's your main job right first year is

[3:13:15]
that's your main job right first year is
just making it survive I've I've
supressed first year she do
live now now kind of the educating
starts right and then elementary school
like you said but it comes down to
taking responsibility of further
education I read your idea as well of uh
trying to get more homeschooling um but

[3:13:32]
trying to get more homeschooling um but
I think people listening to this podcast
you know they're already a bit more they
have a different mindset I think than
than the majority uh so yeah taking
responsibility they're an educating and
not not only pointing at education while
you're the one who should teach my child

[3:13:45]
you're the one who should teach my child
you know whereas the majority of
population in Belgium and the
Netherlands will point at their school
for they you have to teach your sh but
yeah taking responsibility there I think
is a it's a good thing to close this
topic off with I want to thank you very
much Peter uh I want to leave you with

[3:14:00]
much Peter uh I want to leave you with
one final question what would you like
the main takeaway of this conversation
to be for our audience that we had
today
uh let me think um for me it was uh one

[3:14:15]
uh let me think um for me it was uh one
of the reasons to kind of on the podcast
is because these types of podcasts have
uh been inspiring for me in the past uh
hearing a player that has had certain
success convey their thoughts seeing

[3:14:30]
success convey their thoughts seeing
that those players are also human that
they also uh make mistakes have uh maybe
maybe people disagreed with me for
example in things I said so um that that
I'm they were also just human um and

[3:14:47]
I'm they were also just human um and
that people are definitely able also to
like have the same can achieve like the
same things uh that I've been able to
achieve it for
me kind of

[3:15:00]
me kind of
uh yeah lifting the curtain up over over
some of these players that I used to put
on like a pedestal and then you see them
on the podcast and you see
their they're they're human and they're
similar to you as well and you see a lot

[3:15:16]
similar to you as well and you see a lot
of you develop sometimes sympathy for
them um it's kind of a motivating thing
to also uh to also try to get to get to
that point or maybe to achieve that so I
think that was for me the main reason to

[3:15:31]
think that was for me the main reason to
kind of uh try to inspire some people uh
tell them my story uh that it's full of
ups and downs and patience uh and that
you really have to stick with it if you
really love the game and you feel like

[3:15:45]
really love the game and you feel like
it's uh it's future for you of course I
think people starting right now will
have a lot different experience than
than I've had in the past because I've
been playing for such a long time was
blessed to play in in easy games the
beginning

[3:16:01]
beginning
maybe
[Music]
um yeah I think uh if I uh if I'm able
to inspire some people if if uh some
people are like more motivated to to get
to the top um I think that would be like

[3:16:18]
to the top um I think that would be like
uh the main main goal for
me well uh it was very inspiring at
least for me I'm sure Adam is inspired
as well we usually leave these these
conversations quite inspired uh so I

[3:16:31]
conversations quite inspired uh so I
want to thank you a lot man for uh for
uh for sharing your story with
us yeah no problem was uh very fun to
think about the past and uh to get some
hard qu questions directed at me um so

[3:16:46]
hard qu questions directed at me um so
yeah I was very F to do thanks this was
the first uh English speaking podcast uh
that I've actually done in poker um but
I i' I've done a couple of in DCH and
stuff was very fun
thanks what a great conversation that

[3:17:02]
thanks what a great conversation that
was Peter thank you very much for
sharing the wisdom that you gained along
your journey Adam any main takeaways
from today's
conversation yeah I really enjoyed
today's conversation it was a bit
different to some of our previous guests

[3:17:16]
different to some of our previous guests
which I
his background in finance and money H
made some interesting Avenues to explore
bankr management one of the key things
he was talking about was making sure
you're being mindful of where your role

[3:17:32]
you're being mindful of where your role
is allocated not having it all in cash
and thinking about your bank role and
the big takeaway is thinking about how
you can grow your role as an asset as
you're trying to progress with your
career everyone has different goals
different things they try to achieve but

[3:17:46]
different things they try to achieve but
I'm pretty sure everyone listening would
like a big of anroll at the end of five
years 10 years and thinking through your
own strategy for doing that um I think
he opened up a lot of avenues to explore
that think about that and yeah put some
time into it because I know myself if

[3:18:00]
time into it because I know myself if
someone had told me this in my early 20s
maybe I wouldn't have been receptive to
it maybe I would have been but I
definitely needed that extra knowledge
about what to do with money and how it
works and how to invest money rather
than just acquiring other thing patience
I know he's had a long career and it's

[3:18:16]
I know he's had a long career and it's
easy to see people playing tritons and
assume they've always had it made or
they on the path to success he mentioned
having 16 years before he had a big live
cash and that's a long time in any
anyone's career path obviously a lot of

[3:18:30]
anyone's career path obviously a lot of
success on the way you mentioned
multiple six to nemon periods where he
just wasn't getting results and yeah
just the lesson from that for me was
just the ability to be patient when
things aren't going your way he
mentioned that he's very performance
driven rather than results driven which
helps a lot during those times but

[3:18:46]
helps a lot during those times but
there's times where your problem solving
life things aren go the way you want
them to and just stay in the course and
yeah F tune that kind of patience skill
there was an interesting conversation
around intuition versus bias he
mentioned that he's very I think it was

[3:19:00]
mentioned that he's very I think it was
You Ren who tried to pinpoint him on his
decision making process and he wents
quickly to an intuitive framework
instead it's actually quite hard to
break it down because I think quite
intuitively then we talked about how
biases come into that decision making
process that have also logic he's often
using intuition as an initial guide and

[3:19:16]
using intuition as an initial guide and
then logically kind of stress testing
that intuition with different Dynamics
and player types and then we talk about
biases and how they can interact with
that intuitive framework and the final
thing which was a theme throughout was
enjoyment enjoyment of the game right

[3:19:30]
enjoyment enjoyment of the game right
now he's got nothing to prove he doesn't
need to play poker if he doesn't want to
he plays it For the Love of the Game and
the love of competition which sees him
playing Triton stops when he wants to
but the enjoyment of the game I think
that's a key lesson to find ways to
enjoy poker and yeah maybe if you're

[3:19:47]
enjoy poker and yeah maybe if you're
grinding it too hard or you feeling like
you're losing the little for the game so
you remind yourself of the big picture
of why you play the reasons for it and
try to recapture some of that enjoyment
I think would be a a good takeway lesson
how about yourself fredd what the main
takeway is for

[3:20:00]
takeway is for
you yeah you already touch on on the
patients uh there were a lot of other
skills that come with the patients right
we talked about acceptance you already
talked about enjoyment and he also
mentioned luck right that had a big
impact on his career but I feel like

[3:20:17]
impact on his career but I feel like
due to all the other qualities he
managed to stay PO for 16 years so he
managed to put himself in the situations
where he get lucky where other guys
might have already quit so yes sure you
know like he said you know if you reach
a final table get lucky get first a

[3:20:31]
a final table get lucky get first a
couple times instead of seventh for
example obviously it has a big uh big
effect on your result and also obviously
The Compound Effect of that result uh
but all the qualities and skills that he
developed around it to get himself in
the position where he was able to get
lucky uh that's obviously a skill he

[3:20:47]
lucky uh that's obviously a skill he
already talked about the mindset he I
like what he said about um uh mistakes
that mistake point you in the right
direction this is definitely a mindset
right also throughout the 2016 period
2018 where I was losing mtts he didn't

[3:21:00]
2018 where I was losing mtts he didn't
see it as like oh well this is not for
me or he didn't see it as mistakes it's
like well apparently I'm not good at
this he saw it as a challenge he sees it
as something to grow in uh so that's I
really like this mentality around around
uh making mistakes and around down

[3:21:15]
uh making mistakes and around down
swings um
he he talked a little bit about solvers
and studying and he said discover the
science behind poker that's how we used
solvers and I really lik that he also
shared that in his aha moment right
where I like oh I started to experiment
with the solver and uh change a couple

[3:21:31]
with the solver and uh change a couple
of variables like the positions like the
stack sizes so I I I started to
understand the bigger picture right the
science behind poker so I really liked
how he phrased that um he mentioned as
well in terms of time schedule I thought
was interesting because he has multiple

[3:21:45]
was interesting because he has multiple
things going on he liked to have poker
in like a month period there's a certain
event that he only focuses on poker and
then he moves on to the rest and for the
rest it was very accept uh important for
him to delegate find the right people we
talked about that and acceptance right

[3:22:00]
talked about that and acceptance right
acceptance that if you're not 100% just
doing one thing that you know you're
going to slack a little bit right but he
frame it was important to have not his
identity not to only be poker right so
that if poker maybe doesn't go as well
he can get satisfaction out of other Pro

[3:22:16]
he can get satisfaction out of other Pro
uh about an other project that goes well
we also talked a little bit about GTO
and exploitations he said he follows GTO
quite R rically pre- flop and on the
Flop which makes sense because people
nowadays also play most GTO there but
then Turner River becomes way more of an

[3:22:31]
then Turner River becomes way more of an
exploitive game where he applies his
street poker thinking as as as he
labeled it so yeah a a lot of good stuff
