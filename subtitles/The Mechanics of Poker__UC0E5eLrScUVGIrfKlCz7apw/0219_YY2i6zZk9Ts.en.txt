why is it that despite the rise of
powerful tools like solvers and GTO
wizard AI we have seen the average Rim
rate of professional slowly declin over
the last few years I will explain the
answer to this question by showing you
guys the five bad habits players start
to develop when studying solvers and GTO
strategies so you can stop the decline
rise upwards and make more money let's
go bad habit number one being stuck in
defense playing not to lose instead of
playing to win when we open the solver
we see a GTO strategy GTO strategies
provide a framework for unexploitable
play by balancing optimally which makes
it unbeatable regardless of your
opponent's strategy its goal is not to
win the most amount of money possible
but instead play a defensive strategy
designed not to lose not losing is a
great place to start if you are a losing
player however it is likely that your
goal is to make the most amount of money
possible which happens to not be the
objective of the model you've been
studying while there are benefits in
taking a more defensive approach when
playing versus tougher opponents or in
difficult notes in order to boost your
winnings you must evolve towards a more
offensive strategy to take advantage of
the numerous opportunities that are
available to you at the tables bad habit
number two trying to copy GTO strategies
instead of learning poker Theory as we
concluded gto's goal is not to lose
while we are more interested Ed in
making the most amount of money possible
now this does not mean we should all go
and cancel our GTO wizard subscriptions
but rather that we need to shift our
focus and adjust what we aim to learn
from these solvers as when we stop
trying to memorize and mimic the solver
and look beyond the frequencies and
range constructions of the GTO model We
Begin noticing returning Trends and
patterns of play for example in which
circumstances we usually increase or
decrease our bet sizing or bet frequency
what C hand classes achieve in commonly
used lines and how they generate their
EV understanding these drivers will help
eliminate fundamental flaws in your
approach to the game help you make
better decisions even if you are a more
exploitative player because Theory
unlike GTO strategies offer more
flexibility which allows you to adapt
and maneuver and apply it in various
ways and
situations bad habit number three
thinking in have to instead of can I in
solver l players have full information
about the other strategy this means that
it has to construct its ranges in a way
that makes its opponent indifferent
meaning that for many hands in your
range there is no clear higher EV
decision to be made in other words
you're being put in a tough spot because
no action is clearly better than the
other the solver has to do this because
his opponent is also playing perfectly
therefore any imbalance in its strategy
would have direct and expensive
consequences however in the the real
world these consequences don't exist as
most players are too preoccupied with
their own ranges and frequencies trying
to mimic solver strategies they aren't
focused on your range and even if they
are aware of it they won't be able to
execute the same counter strategy a
solver Wen game so the truth is you
don't have to do anything instead we
must focus on what we can do based on
the incentives given by our opponents
and whether the we are considering
making will be plus in this situation
let's say we Face a triple barrel on the
river holding a bluff catcher how do we
decide if we should call here if you
think you're going to have to call this
hand a certain percentage of the time
you're implying that either your
opponent is playing a perfectly balanced
strategy or that you are able to execute
a perfect GTO strategy which in both
cases is very unlikely when deciding if
we should pull the trigger on a bluff or
in this case make the call on the the
river don't focus on whether we have to
call or Bluff our hand a certain
percentage of the time for the sake of
trying to be GTO instead focus on if we
can make a plus of bluff or call in that
specific spot so in case we are
considering a bluff is it likely that
your opponent is going to fold enough or
in our Bluff catch situation is this
spot sensitive to being over or under
bluffed as these are the factors that
will truly have an impact on your win
rate bad habit number four thinking
about your range and frequencies instead
of your opponent's range and tendencies
shifting from half to to cani is part of
evolving from a defensive to offensive
thinking framework we must stop thinking
in threats and instead look for
opportunities given by our opponents
that allow us to make higher EV
decisions instead of focusing solely on
your own cards range and tendencies lift
your head from the table and start
looking at those of your opponents
you'll start to notice that most of the
time they are not playing a strategy so
GTO that they make your decisions
indifferent instead they have Tendencies
and give away information that
incentivizes us to take one action more
often than the other if we go back to
the key poker theoretical concepts of
solver can teach us it is that acity and
frequencies are the main driver of
strategy every human opponent has
difficulty maintaining the exact
frequencies and range construction of a
solver and since their range
construction determines our equity and
Equity is the main driver of strategy
our main objective should be to figure
out what our opponent has and what he's
up to as this information allows us to
make higher EV decisions and deploy more
effective strategies against them bad
habit number five randomizing your way
through the hand if we look at a GTO
flop cat strategy we see the solver
mixing a lot of hands this mixing means
that both lines are generating the same
EV it can't play its hand at a full
frequency as this would either over or
undershoot the appropriate frequency for
the situation he is in it also can
simplify by always betting this hand and
never a similar hand in this category as
villain knows his range and this would
make his strategy very predictable and
exploitable when we try to copy GTO
strategies and start mixing combos
simply because the solver does so many
things can go wrong with the most
significant error being not
understanding how EV is generated in
both lines taken the actual EV of the
hand and therefore its indifference is
determined by how you execute and how
your opponent response in both lines
being mixed whichever line you
understand fully and can execute best or
in which you induce the most mistakes
from your opponent will be the highest E
Line take this turn spot for example we
can either bet or check our hand in
theory however after we check we must
now raise our hand versus a riverbat at
a high frequency but if we instead check
turn and fold the river the turn would
no longer be indifferent and batting
would be the highest a strategy what
often happens is that players start
randomizing hands without understanding
its incentives in both lines they then
end up clueless on where they are at at
the hand and later streets leading to
more randomizing and mistakes as they
fil to plan ahead bonus bad habit the
blocker fattish when we are stuck in
defensive poker have to thinking and
failing to plan H ahead to figure out
how to best generate EV our
decision-making process becomes a mess
we then start looking for any type of
handhold to help us make a decision and
the most common handhold is blockers
since solver strategies are perfect the
only way we can influence our opponent's
frequencies and gain the EV needed to
make something plus v is through the
impact of card removal AKA blocking or
unblocking call or folding ranges while
it's true that blocking or unblocking
increases and decreases the chances of
something happening in most real world
situations this alone is not the
difference between a play being plus or
minus EV but instead it will only
enhance or decrease the EV further take
the following example we are on the
river and deciding on whether we should
Bluff our hand after having B the Flop
and turn goes check check we see that
the solver clearly has a preference for
Bluffs that are not blocking the folding
range while it is definitely true that
this will decrease the percentage of our
Bluff working it's not that relevant as
the impact that this will have on our
Bluff beam plus evv is simply too small
so to have this very high up in our
decision-making process seems pretty
useless in reality there are plenty of
other variables that will have a greater
impact on the EV of our play play Then
blocking or unblocking but since we just
spend a 100 hours in the solver this is
where our mind goes towards when having
to make a decision this steady decline
in win rate of professionals over the
last few years has got me wondering are
the pros winning less because the feud
is becoming more GTO or are they winning
less because they're trying to play GTO
