yes yes yes thank you mr boris brecha
for this lovely tune to open the stream
with
inside of a little seven dudes in the
small light are we gonna go separating
straight
straight from the bed yeah we're gonna
go simmer losing straight from the bed
he believe it alright let's go guys i
open
i just show them drunken style and i
think it's good for poker like bring
some fun enjoyment
it's good for poker guys are we gonna go
straight
you know outside the little seabed
got some potential i see some straight
draws some
sort of spade draws oh
he raises they're [ __ ] kidding me my
friend
you [ __ ] kidding me
are you [ __ ] hitting me
let's go mr cerebral oh
straight away guys straight a [ __ ]
way i don't think about it
pajama yeah yeah pajamas my birthday
gift from
friends it's nice oh my god what a start
guys
what a start they keep on trying
they keep on trying but they're not
succeeding
oh what am i doing what am i doing
well we're turning sets that's what
we're doing
guys it's well it's gonna be one of
those days and seven dudes back to back
oh maybe we can do something here with
the seven dudes
oh we actually gotta walk with the seven
dudes they're so afraid of our seven
deuce powers that they actually start
giving us walks
here actually i think i'm gonna just jam
what do you guys think about that play
this is how i roll right guys i make
good hands and then try to just shove my
stacking
kind of how i roll but that's what we do
literally that's what we do
and he folds okay
okay it's screen suited for sure is jack
suited probably as well so then probably
can't be
and we're dead on the turn
why didn't we have the seven deuce guys
so we called the three four suited check
out the flop they're in the three
back rivers and a's i check he bets
and now it's obviously the question what
should we do
obviously we're just gonna go for it
guys we're gonna go for it
we made it 242 dollars 242
for this man that's the price that's the
price we're putting in
now the question is what did he do
what did he do
he followed guys
thank you tina thank you thank you very
much tina
so much five by bluffing huh ace five
you know it's like the
this is for the gto kids this one is for
the gto kits guys
this was for the gto kit
is gto gonna do the trick he thinking
about it ah
oh sick movement come on
yes i'm the boss who do you think you're
[ __ ] with mate
ah he wants to play with us at [ __ ]
kings let's go let's go let's go
put some of our money back i've lost
some pre-flop
stuff
finish right you again
yep oh my god aces are you kidding me
are you kidding me man king
king king
unbelievable
i had a feel i have a feeling like you
know that if there was no luck in poker
i would just win them all
who said that
at the preflow points unless we're
bluffing our bluff bluff went to the gto
ace five suited
as soon as we have a value hand that's
not really going our way
maybe james were calling
and he had a set blocker a turn zip
locker that's called a well out
that's the one out guys that's that's
how you make one outers
that's how you make one outers guys
that's how you do it
one out four bet against chips
encryption we're gonna get the money in
again let's hope we win
and oh spew caught us with the h4 which
is perfectly fine we lost the first one
come on oh my god we lost again
guys if there was no pre-flop points in
poker we would be rich
guys we would be rich
to refer back to that question that
someone asked if you were as rich as you
got a millionaire
i said that i would get my own private
island by the way it's up
when i say my own private island it's in
a
it's in a place where there's a warm
climate
actually it's like an island that has
like a big mountain
and then on the other side of the
mountain we make a ski dome so i can go
to the beach and snowboarding after
that's
that's some gto stuff right there the
age queen here
and go for a little see that
it's interesting i think barreling is
probably appropriate
in terms of sizing i'll go very very
very very very small
let's see what happens
erases okay okay okay definitely tagging
along here on the turn
with river and ace this is like
probably a switch again so what are we
gonna
do probably don't bet right but what
sizing
10 percent again
nuts random is completely confused chaos
at the table guys
there's chaos at the table
he races okay interesting i mean i don't
think we
can damn this could be a re-bluff
uh i mean he has nines
like if we jam yeah we don't really get
all by words i guess
oh he just had ace queen no funky [ __ ]
there
he just had a screen create some chaos
again here
with the pocket knights
but actually i don't really like this
one but
it do it definitely tagging along
turn the set that's not bad that's not
bad
and that's how that's why we can tag
along guys because we turn a lot of sets
what is he thinking about man he too my
tree is leveling himself pretty hard
guys let's hope he does not have
queens now he doesn't have queens
let's hope he doesn't have uh
jack 10 but i don't think so
should not have that many jackpen
oh he has jeff tim
my god he had the only jack 10
he had the only jack ten
he had the only jack them what a
horrible out that nine was
what a horrible out that night was guys
he had that jack ten
there were the [ __ ] jacks
oh that is a flop guy that's what we
call a flop
is our this is this pocket jacks gonna
make us money now
we obviously go for the trap guys this
guy also he plays quite a lot i'm not
really sure who he is
clean on the turn
does i think change something
low playing time is over guys
so
okay he didn't snap so that's good
are we gonna make some money back that
would be nice man come on
hero call one time king 10
yeah that is a recall my friend it is
heracle
gg for not trapping again sometimes i
fall for the trap to trap again
but as my students will tell me renee
you told me that if you trapped the flop
and it didn't work you cannot trap again
which though no this is actually
actually very good knowledge
uh some free knowledge if you're
trapping the flop that means he's
aggressive
okay or you're inducing in this case
because i have the nuts
then when that doesn't work then no fall
in the trap of trapping again because
then you're just losing value most of
the time
a little bit of a wisdom as well here
it's good for poker and good for my
bankroll as
i'm printing money with the seven dudes
we are literally printing money
private island here i come
you know what we can do guys i buy the
piano
okay then we do the video etc and then i
can give away the pm to the followers
oh pocket kings we're gonna get him
pocket kings yeah actually
that's quite good let's do that
let's do that napsu is trying to win his
money back
boris man anything from boris bracha is
usually golden
oh wait we have seven due suit uh seven
deuce
six sevens let's go
and they fold like they always do
gretchen the final
actually i don't know this song i'm
curious
but usually boris pratcha is good
how good is nuts enemy european i mean
