you started playing poker when you were
only 16 years old I was wondering what
got you into poker at such an early age
and what uh attracted you to the game
you know I was so playing with some with
some fans like couple Euros games like
it wasn't me a couple Euros was like in
low currency but yeah like couple EUR
games and
uh yeah you were play like after school
and stuff and yeah I was playing with my
M account on poker stars and stuff and
and yeah and watching like some YouTube
videos about TV shows about poker and
stuff like that and uh yeah it was all
very exciting and F fun fun thing to
follow I guess any specific uh people
that you were following on YouTube that
stood out to you for example I was
always watching uh High St poker and I
loved Sami Fara did you have did you
have some some some some Idols like
that yeah I remember watching Simon for
those guys like Tom Tom V Patrick
Antonio F yeah all those guys I
was I think I watched all like 10 10 10
seasons I know F episodes so I was
watching and probably a couple times on
repeat I was watching where I'm like
just playing poker watching those
episodes yeah and uh yeah but let's play
couple couple dollars games on stars and
with with friends and stuff and
uh I recall actually uh I think I
watched uh it was Patrick antonus Tom
dwan and Ivy D playing three-handed I
think this was like some Party Poker
Live event and I saw uh Patrick Antonio
had an over pair board came low he
started betting out of position as the
Razer and then Tom dwan he had middle
pair something he called he called and
then the river he turned his hands into
a bluff he went Co call race with middle
pair and I was like wow that was like
out of the buck stuff man back then I
remember I would go back to the online
streets and just basically try to
represent represent the set Always by
just playing Cole Cole race that was
just a new move that I learned and it
worked very well man these guys were
very ahead of their
time yeah I mean maybe if people falling
or something I mean it it could have
worked on a player pool you never know
like most fense could have worked the
player pool and and
stuff yeah but as I said yeah just
started broken like 16 17 years old
first on a months
account yeah just just playing lots of
sit and go like breaking EV in sit and
go maybe making a little a little bit of
money and
uh and actually when I was 18 years old
It's Kind it's kind of interesting story
because I could I could already create
an account on my name so I kind of but I
did it in a very sloppy ways so I I just
logged in on same internet connection
like on my like sister's email just
created my another another account on my
name and and tried to chip dump and they
caught me and I had like thany balance
and I just confiscate my thany balance
and let me play on but all right my name
on my M's name so I just like gar one
gar one screen name firstly was like on
my mom's name and I was 16 17 years old
and yeah so that's that was a bit
stressful backman yeah like 10K was like
90% on with b r onone so in one day or
something yeah I was going to say how
did you say I would say this is like
your first sort of setback in your PO
career you would say you you grinded up
10K you know it's obviously a lot of
money for you back at the time I'm
sure it was sad and like conversation
with po took like a couple months and
uh I think initially my B like
permanently but when I I was like going
back and back and for man and negotiat
now like oh they just confiscate my
money but they override my my my mom's
account name that I was playing on on my
name and they just let me play so yeah
like for first couple months yet it
was it was stressful like M period but
in like couple months already after that
I just was grinding back up with some
bank roll and like having money and we
playing games and yeah it was everything
was back good in a couple months time
it's like it's like at at that time
maybe it looks like big deal but now
it's like
a couple months like so so easy to make
money on of mid Stakes like it's not not
not not not such a high States I
guess you uh you mentioned already a
little bit that you messed around in the
beginning with some sitting goes you're
primarily uh a PL cash game player did
you start to play four card PLO straight
away or did you mess around with hold
them a little bit in the
beginning I think I play like hold them
in certain R like 180 19 years old and
then
then jump a little bit to P but I wasn't
really winning but I was like maybe
playing Zoom for like a year like maybe
50 cents $1 Zoom or something and uh or
maybe even lower yeah for like one year
and uh and breaking even
but yeah but uh when it's stuck yeah I
think I think when I was like 19 years
old I had like maybe 20 G on my name and
like I remember that time I was like
able to move out my house like just R
apartment you know small apartment in my
city so yeah like just move out out my
parents house like 19 years old and just
like yeah so like I had 20K and just
like I I I didn't go to college or
anything so yeah just time to gr it out
or something I guess take it take it
more serious and
uh may I just playing p l it man and and
back then there wasn't any solers so we
just like you maybe you subscribe to
Rond rolls you just watch some Phil Go
on videos like uh try to pick up on some
ideas but like back when there was no PL
solver so no one had like three4 thres
or anything you couldn't really study
like that
but so for the for the new the new the
new school people listening like wait
wait you studied poker without sers H
how did you guys do that back in the
time how did that
work I don't know you just play and try
to see see maybe what what people on the
higher stage do what what what kind of
prea ranges we play and uh and also just
um also I like the theory Theory a lot
like
uh I was reading fors I I I like both
mematic or poker book I was reading I
don't know if you guys know the book
it's uh it's it's like very dense like I
couldn't go for over algebra but I was
thinking like I was thinking about toy
games like oh you BL Bott range and what
what happens to people adjust here and
here so I was already trying to like
figure out some things like what's the
structure of a a game I guess and just
grind out but I wasn't even making money
I think I was like R back Grinder like
like in poer gra there like there like
800k hands so I think I think it was
only like one year or year and a half
period but I was like U just back around
there but when when I transition from
like Zoom
pools to to like uh cash games like
regular tables and
uh and I I think that I think that was
very good for me because uh
like I always prefer a slow space you
know I never enjoy playing like 16
tables I always enjoy like play more
like six tables eight tables and like f
through hands so like I think decision
to to like C like reg tables that I was
like smaller player pool so I could like
remember like which R like I could
recognize a little bit of their
Tendencies what we've been doing
and man I could I could pay more like
attention to each particular table so
like I was able to like
big and but the game was also like I
think that slower Pace like helped me
quite a lot so like so so when I
transition from Zoom like to there
tables I was moving like from $1 $2 to
two far like uh every two months I was
moving a steak so like I went from like
in one year I went from like 1 two to
1020 and next year 10 to 550 like and I
never had the down since to be honest
but yeah so it was it was crazy but I
think the slower PA is what I prefer so
much like it's
if it if it makes sense I don't know
yeah if I talk from my own experience I
feel like Rush games I mean it's Lally
or at least it used to be the name right
I think food Guild call it rush you know
Stars call it Zoom your fast forward
whatever but it really makes me rush it
makes me Rush my game like I
automatically start to play faster it's
like almost I feel Hasty right and when
you feel Hasty you cannot really think
through decision so in general for
example nowadays you would usually steer
people away from Zoom actually it's
something that I notic as well when you
s over your result you clearly saw that
like you beat all the stakes right you
started I think at 25 uh 25 Cent 50 Cent
right 50 andl or 50 p uh and then I saw
everything the fast format of all the
stakes they were losing but the normal T
you were crushing so that was like a
really a h moon for you I guess that you
were like hm maybe I should play less
tables think through hands you know I
guess Also the table Dynamics maybe you
started to pick that
up yeah I it was just my my personality
I was
like even like I read a book like early
in my career like like thinking fast and
slow so I think I was always like more
like you know I I wasn't really like
enjoying beh I always enjoying more like
a structure type of things so I think I
always like to enjoy like and and
historically I would like l a lot of
time bank and stuff so I always like
like in sure to just play slower like be
cognitive about each each situation
what's happening a little bit remember
so maybe I can pick up and learn and uh
understand and maybe maybe I was
studying something at that time and
so so I can see on the tables and I
could actually implement it so so it it
was yeah I always like just prepar to
play slow like less amount of tables
play slower
and maybe maybe midak I was like move
playing like six tables eight tables but
when like since 1020 2550 I was like
mostly just keep like to like three four
five days tables unless there's like
really good like a lot of really like
good games with a lot lots of recreation
say play like eight 10 tables but they
never enjoyed to play like so so many
tables so I was like was just a bit like
slower enjoy more I think was slower
Pace was giving me just much better
results I think yeah so you mentioned
that uh you know like like you said you
started 16 and now you're talking about
when you were like already 19 grinding
almost 800k hands in in this span of a
year maybe a little bit over year quite
high volume I'm sure we will get back to
that um you were already professional
back at the time and when when and how
did you make the decision of becoming a
professional like what kind of attracted
you to the idea of of being a
professional poker player you saw
Patrick antonus sitting there you know I
think Patrick antonus was was like one
of the you know when you started or when
I started as well you looked at Patrick
tone is like wow right I think there
were even memes going around like what
people think I do but what I actually do
remember those me you saw Patrick Tony
sitting there all cool was that kind of
the idea that you had about being a
professional poker
player not
really to be honest at what time when
you like 20K Bank know oh maybe I can
make maybe maybe maybe if I start making
like 50k a year or maybe it's going to
be like oh I will be rich or any to
compare to what what you are like maybe
I can make 100K like I never imagined
like I could be like P I thought all
there's like so many billion people
billions people in a world and I'm just
one of the guys and I know I know I want
to try hard it but and uh and put the
effort but I I never imagined I can only
see like one one step ahead you know so
if you play one two I think oh maybe
there's like two four three six guys I
remember I see like some guys playing
510 I imagine oh these guys must be
making so much money if they can win
like at same at five Danes
so yeah so I never imagine it's it's
it's
uh I could even make well I don't know
but like but I I I I did want I was I
was going after my goals like every day
goals and all or like or like in one
year I hope maybe I can get better maybe
in one year next year I can get like
double Earth or something
so yes so I I don't know and I never
imagine myself being in that position
but but yeah like after some point
you're just playing and it's kind of
becomes normal and you just look at next
goal and next goal becomes bigger and
bigger I guess yeah so every year you
kind of started to believe more in what
was
possible I don't even know if I believed
it I I think I was just taking proud in
doing good things what I was doing like
I was being proud of being a doing G
good results at 24 when I went to 36 in
a couple months when I was when I was
being very proud with I'm having good
results 1020 and and the money was good
and I was wanteded I was excited to make
even more money so was go to 2550 and
was very good working out and
uh we and one guy I remember I want I
want to give shout out shout out to one
guy this is not like not named WR but on
ran once's videos like where it was s
reviewing No Limit videos and my friend
remind me that I was like for one or two
years but like big I was playing blo but
I was like always watching like s No
Limit videos and trying to pick up
things so like even I was playing
different game but I was like a big fan
of Poker and like just that type of
mindset like structures and the and
exploits and adjustments
and I remember I was studying with a
couple people
like I think I think Dios like like I
probably read mathematics of poker book
like a couple times like I was just I
didn't know algebra all but but I was
enjoying my like th games so much and uh
so it was all very exciting I guess but
yeah
so but I never really saw myself like
three steps ahead where I could go I I I
was only seeing one step ahead but I was
like trying to be efficient and trying
to reach my The Next Step all the time
because
yeah I remember those uh those SS videos
he was also I remember he also messed
around quite a lot with toy games I
guess his his very theoretical approach
mathematical approach kind of associated
related to you right also with the
mathematics of Poker you mentioned also
that you were doing some reading you
mentioned Thinking Fast and Slow what
drove you towards that side and have you
always been going out to resources like
books videos to
improve I think I was always better like
at like map M things when like verbal
things so so even in like in a in a
school like even what when was like
first class first grade second grade
third grade like when when I was doing
math I could do like math test like like
very easier and all all the like
language like like liuan language
classes or English language classes it
was so much more
difficult so I was like I think I was
like maybe like just that type of
mindset you know I had I don't know like
a yeah but I remember like first fourth
grade for like simple math you know like
I don't know like uh you combine you
divide so like I would do that like 45
minutes like T like 10 minutes and like
and it was three I could like you know I
was always go like small like like
divide and like
uh I guess yeah that was kind
of yeah it was I guess my strong
Pursuit and then later when I was like
playing 2550 5100 I think uh
I I think my weakness was like actually
maybe overdoing that like trying to not
being as fortable I think I think I
could have like a j to player pool a bit
better and stuff yeah so so I makes
sense yeah but yeah I've I've heard this
before like I personally never really
came from from a math background I I
don't know I thought very intuitive
about the game like and certain things
make sense is this plus of V or not that
L Lally that was that was basically the
main F process I really focused on okay
well what's his range what what is my
what basically I was thinking my hand
against his range and against his
tendencies that was how I approach poker
for the majority of my career I remember
at actually also some guys on the
podcast that went very much on the GTO
route early especially when solvers
weren't out there very the mathematical
route and they they also said I think
like the the calling one minus Alpha and
defense frequencies that's usually where
where they kind of screwed up did you
have like a similar experience at some
point where just pure math or that
version of GTO back in the days kind of
let you down
I don't know if if if I really let him
down but but yeah I was like a guy with
trying to figured out what's what's
minus alha here and and and I was always
worried about people exploiting me or
something I was never never really
looking to exploit people know I was
more like in a defensive manner but
trying to play a strong game and
uh and and I think generally how I
approaching Pok like just try to might
be exploited but
uh yeah but I wasn't looking for so many
exploits I guess but
uh but later on I picked up I picked up
like on population Tendencies and uh and
uh and some like and also like on on a
high St if you like play 25 50 plus 50
100 plus like the player pool is like
pretty smaller I guess in P it's like 20
people so you kind of so you already
have like history with almost every
single player so you kind of adjust you
not even like yeah you kind adjust to
like people dependencies you already
remember this guy I played like three
years already so you kind of SL P kind
of smaller I guess but yeah so point you
get so much information on specific
components that you cannot really uh
ignore it anymore right whereas in the
beginning of your career or if you play
lower mid Stakes big pools like for
example the the zoom pools or fast
forward pools uh yeah it's a bit more
rewarding to focus more on your own
strategy you already mentioned like
through this first 800k hand patch right
you learned that uh the zoom format
wasn't for you right that you prefer to
play lower tables any like specific
because like the 800k hands that
followed actually you made a million
right so what what what what did you
learn other then you know Zoom isn't for
you and you should play less tables and
actually think through hands what what
else did you learn in that first 800k
hands that kind of set you up to win 1
million in the following 800k hands
I think next 800 800k hands was more a
like more like two three two year two
three year period so it was like a my
period was longer you know so I was
playing a bit less hands but
also also I think it was just natural
progression like you start 16 17 you
have a couple years to learn poker and
iide pretty young so I was playing like
18 19 years old so I think like couple
years I I don't know if it was a have
moment but yeah like like I I I probably
figured out some mistakes I was doing
some I fixed some pre flop I fixed some
bad tendences
I maybe I speaking maybe in six marks
you you you get bigger percentage B
bigger percentage for like
tables maybe get a bigger percentage of
recreational players when in Zoom pool
so but I remember when I was playing to
far like I was playing one two to four
three6 at the same time but you could
pick like there maybe like 20 20 tables
riding so I would pick maybe 10 best
games you know I I I close down Wars
game maybe was a new game coming up so
you always a little bit choosing so I
think maybe it was just naturally like
you could have like slightly better
games because you could get bigger
percentage of on Recreation or something
you know but but but I was still working
all almost this time with like I was
making some new friends like like like
um not also play PLO or something or
played a game but also studying PLO so I
was still learning but I I can't really
tell like what was exact thing like I
change I don't know if my mind my minds
are Chang I think I just naturally kind
of you grow up in know like 189 maybe
you you kind of you not not figure out
but like couple years you work and you
just like noticing things and you become
better and
uh I think I was starting using when I
was like 22 23 years old so it's still a
couple years later I was I was already
playing 2550 and without a solers so but
yeah so like I don't know I wish I wish
I could tell more what people were play
playing now what what was a big
breakthrough but I think this was more
like just natural progression I don't
know if it's like a sport maybe just you
know just growing up in a shape in shape
or something I don't know so yeah of
often often in the podcast the word
experience has been brought up right
that you cannot really shortcut
experience you just need to put in a
certain amount of hours certain amount
of EV I guess also to become familiar
with yourself right like okay how does
grass V when does grass V performance is
best right you already figured okay Zoom
is not for me maybe I should play less
tables so throughout those hands if
you're curious about yourself right and
if you're looking to improve I guess you
just naturally get to know yourself how
you work what works for you is does that
sound more like what was going
on yeah I think so and
uh yeah I was always improving and
another big breakthrough I don't know
like if you guys want to if I'm already
juming ahead but like when I was 21
years old 21 years old I I went to like
uh to like I I flew down all the way to
Rio to me some another pocket players
you know so we were playing PLO so I was
like in a I met some people like in PLO
Circle already so we all playing like
kind of 1020 2550 and we got some guys
were like 10 years old we retiring below
and I was just moving out so know so we
are changing like having like changing
ideas and mindset so I picked up what we
had and uh and I was learning from them
getting all feedback from them getting
feedback from me and stuff and we yeah
that type of thing so but but I don't
know technical I don't even remember
what technical exact thing but yeah you
just like try to good play good P FL you
try to whatever we have like some
polarized ranges like you BL but range
if if you have a read someone overfall
overfall you try to Bluff him more if
you if someone is maybe too aggressive
you TI you tighten your ranges you or
you you you play less hands but you play
more more aggressive to punish them or
something like
that it was like a logical preol
thinking you know I feel like sometimes
if you say to your new school players
like oh wait that's an interesting way
of looking at it so I feel like you know
there's definitely some some benefits in
in in having
having grown up before before solvers in
terms of you know the way you think
about how to come to an optimal solution
other than uh other than pure pure
solver work Adam um I was wondering any
any lessons you think that every poker
player kind of has to learn in the
beginning of in the beginning of their
career like we talked about experience
sort of things you know you just get a
shortcut so are there anything things
that send out to you that you know
players just have to learn through
experience in the early years
poers hard and you suck is a realization
that you need to learn through playing
and I think when you first get into it
you're all excited yes I've played my
friends I took $2 of my mat let's do
this poker stuff I just read a book I've
watched some Source videos I'm going to
crush at the high stakes let's go then
poker comes punches the other the side
of the head a few times so I just
learning to grow up and realize it's a
tough game there's a lot of nuance that
takes a long time to learn and you can't
shortcut that so I think the first few
years are getting rid of the ego
learning how to learn it's probably a
very valuable lesson learning to deal
with emotions and swings it's very hard
when you're when you're playing for a
few dollars not too bad when it's your
lifestyle it's your income and your kind
of livelihood on the line playing a game
all of a sudden the pressure starts to
build how do I support myself should I
get a job like my friends so there's a
lot of things obviously depends on the
age you start uh I started young you
started young all three started quite
young so we can relate to the having the
hustle to make money to support
ourselves other people might come from a
bit of money or a job or something but
most need to learn how to manage their
lifestyle deal with the setbacks and
realize that it's a tough game it's
going to be take a while to learn so I'm
I'm curious to know for you guys this
with your journey you've had a smooth
ride from the sound of it but one thing
I feel that is overlooked is how much
you've prepared for this so it feels
like the way you're talking there you
live very much in the moment you don't
set like a three-year goal and then work
towards it you're like right here right
now that's challenged that's conquered
this moment in front of me but it feels
like you have an element of preparation
that I feel like isn't normal of the
ordinary so let talk us through those
early years how are you preparing to
beat the levels that were in front of
you yes so it's through it it was
like it was it all all was like so
exciting and and like challenging
exciting but so yeah I think I was
basically like living breathing and
doing all the things po related like uh
for like eight years like even if you
play like eight hours a day you know I'm
still like I wake up I shower when I'm
shower I'm thinking I'm thinking what
what hands I played yesterday what
what's upcoming with what's what's
schedule today because I know oh I show
up the re games which is what's going to
happen more or less so even if I play
like eight hours today I think it's like
10 10 11 hour job still like because
even when you're not playing you still
like sometimes you just stay stay in
your house and you just like thinking
about hand so
it's it was like yeah it was full-time
job and I would take a vacation to be
honest it's or like days off I
was I probably take a one day off a week
or something but but sometimes I don't
even take days off or something I just
like you know I would still like go out
party or go to a gym most days and like
still keep up but
uh but yeah it's was like full-time job
and and even though
like I even though I don't think I I I
have like any like experience of like
downfall for myself but I saw some other
people like where they struggled
like like for example when I was 20
years old I was trying to find some new
study partners or someone one guy D two
post like study like do you guys look
for study anyone wants to study together
I message him and started studying
and through him I met these three guys
but but this particular guy that I
message
like so so we here play but I was like
picking my games but this guy would just
come and he would play but freehanded
games to his incompetence and he would
always go like 1020 and play freehanded
like strongest 1020 lineups and for like
three years and and everyone says like
friend like oh there's no way he's
making money so like so he for three
years just go doesn't do doesn't really
make any money he he could like just
pick his game play play games players
but he almost like doesn't want to do
that and just plays like strong
freehanding games and obviously after a
couple years you just R away because you
don't make any money you just play you
play a level to your competence but you
need to need to find games that are
lower to your to your like where where
you can beat for games you low to your
competence you like you cannot just play
or like move up to a stage for that
lever of your competence or you're just
breaking even or something things so
it's just not going to work out you need
to have a urge find find answer you have
an urge I guess and
uh but when it comes to Performance I
always like I was trying to like yeah
keep keep my body in shape like exercise
maybe before was exercising quite a lot
like five times a week six time a week
going for gym going for runs and uh yeah
just playing like six 78 hours a day and
most days and
uh yeah it's like full-time job I I
don't you know what if if you ask me
like some particular questions maybe I
can answer any better but like I don't I
don't know where to extrapolate from B
yeah we'll go deeper and yeah I think
for you we can see this level of
dedication Obsession and wanting to be
the best before this podcast you reached
out with some friends to get some
questions and to get some ideas to ask
you and one of your friends Tom and give
some insights into how you approach
stuff which I thought was really
interested is interesting and he said
you delicated very quickly to cleaners
and Cooks to make more for poker you
figured out the best times and the best
games to play and then you base your
sleeping habits around that you have a
natural sense of stoicism I'm going to
underline and come back to that you are
open with mistakes and having a growth
mindset rather than a fixed one and you
have a ton of great habits so I wanted
to put that forward because it shows a
level of dedication and professionalism
to Poker like an athlete like Tre like a
sport and everything's taken care of so
I want to come back to your friend said
you have a natural sense of stoicism so
when I think of that I think someone is
quite level-headed they take life as it
is they they focus on what they can
control and what they can't so for you
what is that natural sense of stoicism
that is that potentially helped you with
your PO
career I don't know I don't even I don't
even like to use thate of B on myself
you know like I don't even like maybe
some other people maybe call it better
or I un likee you for B on myself
because because I was like I also like
throughout all most of my career I also
was more like self-critical instead of
like like
uh instead of reinforcing myself on
positive things I was more like scanning
for negative things that I did in my
tables and everything so that's more
like
but yeah when it comes to
preparation yeah what what I think yeah
at some point you can just yeah dedicate
quite a bit of face and I think what he
means like yeah you are just like friend
in Brazil like sometimes you would share
houses or something or or live close by
and and yeah like a lot of people I if
you can afford like yeah you can get the
cleaners we have like private cooks and
and now you can just have like ubber
obviously but but yeah but yeah but I
think more important I just take care of
your health and
uh yeah but you need to take
responsibility for whatever whatever you
know your your career and stuff so you
with nothing's going to happen for you
like you need to go out there like seek
information and uh keep yourself
responsible like if if you want if you
you just think you're gonna show up to a
game that or I just play four hours a
day I I I was you so curious and but
going to be a younger guy where just
where like wants to eight hours a day
two two days two hours in solers and
just talks with five other guys that
wants to for same take I mean we
probably not going to like out War them
in one year time or something and where
so it's it's just like I think it's kind
kind of Pretty Natural
but yeah I think it shows how high the
bar is like at the top like yourself the
preparation the mountain you do to
prepare yourself for the hours you play
then everything that goes around your
grind to make sure you're prepared is at
a high level and you can't just show up
and expect to beat people like you who
are putting more work in so I think it's
a a good wakeup call to players who
maybe don't treat it as professional as
you but have dreams of playing the high
stakes now you mentioned you are very
self-critical and I always curious about
this because self being self-critical
can also help you learn very quick
you can look at mistakes and study
harder but it can also be toxic if
you're too negative towards yourself it
can Lear a spiral so how would you use
this self-critical feature in order to
learn to improve and to increase your
learning oh yeah always
like I think last couple years I was
more transitioning to like try to
positive reinforce
myself but like since I was like I again
until like whatever until like 27 26
years
old and most my career like all I would
do on tables I was like scam mistake so
did I make a mistake here I was just
like like every I'm scanning I don't
want to make a mistake I want to don't
miss anything I want to do even in your
life or I'm thinking or not not I'm
going to go to gym and and I feel good
or I'm always like think oh I miss out
or like I need to do this because I fall
back or something so y like on my career
I think I was most like like
just my my my was reinforc for like you
know like not criticizing yourself but
like try to scan for like weaknesses
instead of like having some positive
like oh this is but I think I think it
was good to certain extent but
uh at some extent it's also you you just
luse more more energy so if if you you
just wanted to play 2K Habs or something
like that I think I I don't think I
could keep a good volume but like just
scanning and trying to pay a lot of
attention to each each each single hand
so I think I would use more energy so I
I think very situation it's more eff
it's more efficient to be like very
critical to yourself but
also but also some of things you start
to like look at too much of a detail but
it doesn't really matter and just kind
of you just kind of a bit like a bit too
like musing too much energy that because
in efficient so I think yeah I think at
some like right now I would use it if I
advise people I would I would advise
them to like me be more balanced because
some some sometimes on some things you
don't need to use too much enery but but
some things are important that you need
to make sure you do right yeah so yeah
very good advice oh perfect I think it's
very good as well because you mentioned
kind of the both both sides of it one
scanning everything to make mistakes and
how that can help you improve and get
better but also you can overload
yourself you can be too perfectionist
look at too many details and almost like
expensive energy so for you in a
practical way let's say when you spotted
mistakes ear in your career maybe when
you had less of a a pretty graph to look
at how would you learn from mistakes how
would you get better when you saw
mistake here what was your going to
process for Learning and eradicating
those
mistakes like at that particular time I
don't know if I was really see
mistakes I think I was just grinding out
playing
like I wasn't doing so much solar world
because like
like like how you going to know
something is a mistake you maybe you
lost a hand and you don't like how you
play a hand but there's no way to
confirm as a mistake and I didn't have
so many people to ask
so but maybe thankfully the player po
was like I could still beat them so I
could still like make a living from it
but but late later I did like when I was
like five years my career or something
with solers and stuff like yeah like I
could go in technical things and like
could dedicate things to do and
uh I could look look look half myself I
could go through through like uh hold
their manager and stuff and trying to
find things or like or where is
imbalances where is people like winning
more of a b than me or like winning more
hands winning more hands than me what
situations and stuff like that yeah but
when I was when I was super young like
18 19 20 like yeah like I was most like
reading books about like uh on Theory
like mathematics po I'm reading I'm
trying to playy games I'm trying to
understand what is what what is this you
poker thing is this like just luck or is
this like you actually have some thought
process and you can structure and you
can oh say there it's
like there is three stets and it's and
it's no limit you supposed to bet like
uh how do you say geometrical sizing
because that's going to exract you by
mostv other thought so see about those
typee of things I was trying to
understand the just the structure of
Poker yourself you know
so but but analyzing for mistakes is
hard to know what's what is a mistake
especially playing where you know beting
so it's like it's very hard to know what
what is a mistake so I wish I could tell
more about it like like I don't even
have it well I think yeah the big
takeaway there is you don't dwell too
much on them and a lot of players spend
all their days thinking about a mistake
they might have made and uh yeah not
sleeping very well because of it whereas
you you're like I don't know was mistake
I trying to learn the bigger Concepts
the bigger picture and keep learning it
feels like you for you forward motion is
always been the name of the game keep
running volume so alongside that and
often overlooked skill and poker is
being able to put in high quality volume
consistently it sounds like throughout
your career you've been able to do that
so for you how have you managed to
optimize and continue to put in high
volume from a excited 19-year-old all
the way to a very successful 29y old
what's being the keys to to you putting
high volume
so last couple years
so I wasn't so excited about B like to
to be honest I was like how how fast I
don't know I don't know his good is fair
here but yeah but before we like when I
was 21 I was just tra I was Trav with my
friends and uh we go you go nice places
go like Brazil you go like South Africa
and you all just grind and and it's very
exciting to make good money and and I
always like the game I
always I feel like I a ner guy and stuff
and
uh I always enjoy like a little bit of
board games and stuff like that and and
I think this kind of Poker was thing
like kind of fit fitting my personality
pretty well always was very exciting a
bit
competitive and I could learn things and
everyone was traveling and also you're
making money so you know at the end of
the day maybe I can spend the sum in the
year world or something so it's it's
always very exciting so so I I never
really had to for at least for me like I
never I had to like oh I wake up I need
to find motivation no I wake up yeah
maybe you go exercise or maybe go
sometimes like go to the beach or
something but a lot of it is you almost
already you're almost itching oh I want
to go play some poker I want to compete
I want to so like most of my career I I
didn't have the expression to be honest
so it's but I like it was it was like
bad for me it was just very exciting I
wanted to make more money and uh there
some people compete compete with and
and I
guess and and I guess it was something
I'm good at so may poker is is also nice
nice to build something good at you know
po like nine out of 10 some other things
I'm not so good but like so I didn't
realize maybe later I realized oh maybe
I'm compensating a little on poker but
but it was always so exciting for me
so if it makes sense yeah it sounds like
you've got that excitement curiosity
enjoying it a nice balanced lifestyle so
you're not Bing out then also a work
ethic in a professional approach the
game and you couple all those things
together and your Summer's just there
consistently you're not really thinking
about being motivated you're just always
showing up there's a book I read once
called The War of art by Stephen
pressfield and that's all about like
being a professional and what you do and
sometimes you're motivated and you want
to do it other times you sure up no
matter what you just get there and and
put the work in I think some people
really struggle to relate to that
because they rely on motivation they
feel motivated sometimes and they put
hours in other times like I don't feel
like it where yours like I don't really
care like I'll go to the gym come back
and get get going I'm not really
bothered about the the fleeting feelings
that I experience now for you you
mentioned in the questionaire we give
you that the most enjoyable part of your
career in the high point was the journey
and like the middle years in particular
I think it was like 2019 2020 roughly
where you living with friends you're
around lots of people but you're
climbing up the poal lettera and you
mentioned during this heory you are
preparing to overtake the world so what
was about this time that was enjoyable
and how were you preparing to take over
the world during this part of your
career
yeah like we just some couple poker
players
like Liv in exotic
places like we like I have a couple like
we called students but we also
like like I want I want to give a shout
out to one
guy like one of my my friends like like
this guy he is like PD in game theater
so I I know some other players before me
like he has some guys in in U like game
theer guys but but those guys like he's
like G Alex from GTR in B so so so he
already bu like one of the limit solers
and he was playing like five time the
limit but he was he wasn't enjoying
playing so much but he was like enjoying
the all the game tier aspect so so so
yeah so was that's like PD and game the
so like we we a couple players we just
like we hired this guy and he was coach
us and uh like some our students been
asking him so much questions but for me
it was so very exciting everything it's
I was just asking this guy with question
so what's happening here like can you
explain this to me
like but also this guy he was already
come from a Lim background so he knows
how to do all the solers V you ask him
oh can you look my can you do like leak
findings so and and after after after
some point like you just traveling
getting a group and you just have like a
big feedback loop coming so I don't know
it's it sounds a little like a bragging
I know like for lower size guys maybe
it's not so related but it was at that
point was so exciting because oh I'm
making oh I having one million BS in my
account have two million my my account
there's some high St to climb and I
think oh maybe it's go be higher St I
don't see yet now so I just going to
keep preparing as much as I can and
hopefully where it's like some come ups
and I can just take advantage of
opportunities and just maybe get to some
big games so you have good RN rate and
keep it up so it was yeah all very
exciting yeah I think it's a good
reminder as well that often the high
point is that growth period where you're
learning you're improving you're getting
better you're striving to get the top
then when you get to the top obviously
it's amazing but often you miss that
journey of like trying to get better
trying to improve and from your story it
sounds like those are the G you look
back on is like the magical G where you
just absorbing information you're having
a lot of success but you're you're
aiming to climb higher and higher which
is a yeah a good good um reminder I'm
curious to know for you did you have
anything to prove during this point so
we're getting the sense of excitement
Obsession for the game but at some point
you realize hm I'm pretty good at this
game and you realize you're beating
people around you you start thinking
about the the highest Stakes you can
play and at some point maybe you start
to think about beating other people or
try to prove how good you are but you
was anything driving you internally to
want to keep pushing to get higher and
higher and and beat the best
I'm not sure so I think maybe was
slightly compensating like you know I
was just good at poker so maybe I'm not
just so good in our last like not so so
social guy so I was a little
compensating and I also consider was
considering what what's the right point
to retire know because I think oh you
like I'm still beating the game so much
but I'm thinking oh if I make less than
10% of my money or like less than 10 if
I if if I have full-time job but I make
less less than 10% of my money should I
I was like I was considering for a
couple years once the I point know we're
retire I'm not retiring yet but like I I
was like always considering oh like I
know at some point well I probably
should stop doing poker and should just
go like explore our Ventures maybe like
try to become better socially get more
balanced lifestyle more like uh improve
improve our communication skills and
stuff
so but also a lot of things like a lot
of is being real en Force by you being
good pocket player but also you know so
for myself and from other people maybe
or like perception so so I was like keep
keeping my ball running for a couple
more years but yeah like but last couple
years it wasn't so exciting to be honest
but but uh yes so for you as you
mentioned there as well like when do you
pivot to something different if you want
to you've invested so much into poker
you've climbed the ladder you've at the
top of the the game you're getting very
lucratively rewarded to keep playing but
at some point you're like I've kind of
won the game I've kind of achieve what I
wanted to achieve I've got the financial
results I've got the success I've got
the the overall achievements that I
wanted is there something else I want
and life's always this complicated game
of choosing your path in life and when
to explore other things so obviously for
you you've never really had to explore
that for I'm guessing a long time
because the first seven eight years of
this amazing Fun roller coaster and at
some point maybe more recently you've
started to ask okay when do I do other
things do I want to do other things and
because I put so much into the poker has
that left some gaps in my life that I
want to maybe address at some point so
obviously things to explore as you as
you age and mature and think about the
future in a in a more holistic way but
it feels like the energy put in the PO
obviously has been very much rewarded
and yeah feels like for you wasn't
coming from an ego perspective it's more
that the Love of the Game just wanting
to play and just it's one of those
things when you keep putting effort in
and you keep showing up results take
care of themselves to some degree then
everyone asks you around you starts
going how did you do it what was the
plan how did you master this and you're
like I just kept showing up and just
kept playing and all of a sudden I kept
beating everybody and here we are today
having this conversation so yeah think
I'm getting a little bit of that from
from your journey well actually like one
interesting thing that was very very
good in my polar career like when I was
reaching like 2550
Stakes like it was like 20 like uh I was
21 years old 20 years old and
uh and at that time like pin po was like
B6 sauce I and it was so nice that when
I reach f55 like this guys retired as
you know so like everyone like all the
top guys like all like all the like all
the top players backyard down like
retired and like so there was almost no
no old guys left for me like when I
reach 2550 so it was it it was very good
timing for me to be honest too so it was
I think I maybe have like slly more
smooth Journey because like just for
circumstances around like some people
retiring and stuff and
uh is that a little bit a bit sweet do
you uh and some elements wish they were
still around to
play yeah because I was always got an
image like oh this is the type of guys
are going to have to compete or I
thought the new guys going to come up
they're going to be also the same games
like these guys just there new names but
these guys but it wasn't really like
that to be honest
but it was like like a couple strong
guys but most of the guys weren't even
trying so hard
I think there are some other guys we
just try to jump into games like get
some money from a recreational but but
there wasn't so many like Str like guys
trying to like oh I'm GNA just go into T
I'm GNA become very solid poker player
but also like very solid in my specific
format and when I just Tred to compete
so hard so yeah so it was good for me
because it was like more smooth ride for
me but it's uh you know so but so it's
maybe a little bit sweet but I'm happy
with it made it made me my games a bit
easier I guess but yeah yeah the path
opened up but there's a little bit of
that competitive drive that window there
if I had have played those guys it would
have been a fun part of the journey and
there' be a yeah cherry on top of the
cake so to speak to uh to do that but
yeah as you mentioned it created a kind
of a smoother path so for you you've had
like a long career and it feels like
there hasn't been many big drop offs in
terms of your performance there hasn't
been any major burnouts any major
crashes so there's some form of the way
you've managed yourself on a regular
basis with your habits your routines
your approach to Poker that has worked
really well for you so for you like talk
us for like how you manage your energy
on a daily basis what are your habits of
showing up because we're sensing a very
hard workout grinding hard putting lots
of hours in but there's no drop off
there's no like Big B out nobody crashes
unless unless there is it feels like
you've approached it with sustainability
so how how was me your approach to your
poker lifestyle and keeping that balance
right yeah
so so eight years I was like living from
some like last couple years like I was a
little messing up like I was like or I
go out dra game but sometimes I'm I'm
home I'm bored I'm playing poker and
like last like last one two years
probably like like 30% of my S are
playing drunk to be honest I'm still
making money so I'm still making money
but but
uh but first like four or five years or
something it's always just like
Supernatural you just travel around and
uh
and you have some friends and I have
some X po play by retire we just go to
we live we go to to beach we go out we
go go to dinners we get some drinks and
uh yeah it's it's
uh yeah try to get in a Fleep and go to
a gym I guess and U and uh yeah I wasn't
was never like yeah trying to keep
reasonable enough di yet but it much
yeah just
I I gained some weight couple couple
last years ago but before that it I
don't know it was it wasn't so hard but
I think the pock itself was very
exciting to be honest so it's I don't
know I don't know what to say about yes
it's it's a nice I didn't I didn't knew
this career P career P to be existed to
be honest like I I to be honest I didn't
even finish the high school I dropped
out to four grade so so like I was like
a a little bit of hooligan so I dropped
out four grade I didn't finish the high
school and uh oh I always knew I'm a
smart guy I always knew I'm smart with
money but
uh but oh ver poker I think I'm decent
it and I'm just like focused learning a
little bit learning and uh yeah it was
all very exciting and yeah I I need need
to find motivation because I just wake
up and I like I like playing poker so we
just show up and uh
and and I think maybe I'll say like
mathematically not
I'm not like the smartest guy but like
I'm I'm still like good good at math and
stuff so I was able to compete on it and
yeah yeah it sounds like the living and
breathing pokam kind of everything else
kind of went in hand with that the
lifestyle stuff it just became of course
I need to sleep of course and went to
the gym just like all the things around
it to facilitate performance especially
during those eight obsessive years when
you just that's all you did and all you
thought about so yeah it kind of makes
sense why there wasn't really any
burnout you didn't really think about
balance and stuff it all just came into
a a packaged deal of how to perform so
much like we're into uh risk taken and
your approach to risk because from the
outside looking in you've played some of
the biggest online pots in the world
things that made people go wow like it
just blows your mind like how much money
is on the table and and you've obviously
transitioned from lower Stakes to at
some point been in those games how have
you approached the swings and deal with
risk especially as you've made big jumps
to playing like bigger games that are
like even for yourself big how have you
dealt with the potential swings you
could take at those new stakes and how
you handled days or or sessions where
you've had big negative swings
I think maybe like 2550 was 50 100 when
I was moving
up because I move up to 2550 quite fast
and maybe I was trying to pain 2550 with
like 60 bu 60 buy you know bank or
something and I was taking shots at 5100
with like 40 buying bank roll
and and I was always good at like both
games like both 40 l was good at short
stack I was good good at bit High stack
so so if I'm taking shots you probably
if you taking shots you probably want to
like uh find the better games and like U
and maybe short stack if you can and
stuff like
that so yeah I was doing that
but so so maybe when I was 21 to 25 it
it kind of matter in some a couple
situations or think I think short maybe
200 but I never really had to go down
but after like after I was grinding out
like couple years uh at some point I was
like I was just bank for like f 5100 I
had like what whatever 500 buying know
so or like 100 200 I also had like yeah
a lot of buying so and and I could also
short stack and we G very soft enough so
like I wish I could tell you wish it's
not bragging I wish I could tell you
guys you something more but like for me
I I like it was only early in my in my
career like like mov 2550
5100 but maybe you want to short stack a
little bit you know and just pick your
games a bit more better or stay or stay
at the stake that you're comfortable
with like like I never like to go down
too much but I I was always
like I was also s like I didn't like
like big down so I was always trting to
prepare a lot and if there a St ation
you can like short stack which is which
is not good for doesn't sound good for
action but if there is a guy if you
Recreation joining or six game and it's
do shot you probably better like go
short stack and if you don't have so
much bank roll
so see that sounds like a lot of
managements and always have enough of a
role to play the games you're playing so
it didn't affect you financially the
swings what about when you're playing
those crazy games like 20g and om Rose
where there's like three million on the
table it must be a little bit scary to
be going those big pots any do you feel
anything during those games is there any
uh emotions that go on after those games
and thinking about the vast amount of
money you could win or
lose I wish I wish I was a little bit
better prepared for those games
because I remember those games
like I a like 20 25% of a bank roll in
like crypto you know or like like that I
could deposit or something
and uh at the start like like we playing
those games and I think I just read like
two million ding or something and I'm R
for do million down thing and I just
busted my crypto and I didn't want to
send sell my assets or anything like
stocks or or another things but they
were three good tax of selling you know
so I I think a little bit better
sitations and then next year he just had
just had the craziest games so he could
could play and I busted like two three
million bank roll or something I to fre
down thing and I like I could deposit
but I have to sell some assets or
something to deposit and it's it's kind
of you know you already like trigger
some tax events and set sell it if you
have some stocks or something but om for
all like it's like like it's probably 50
50% and maybe some some guys we have
more crypto or something they could just
have like big you can draw some more
money so so basically couple months I
just played it but I just busted what I
was able to bust it like reasonably and
uh
but where one or two guys and all just
cashed in I think big one year I think
you won like 20 million or something
about the year I don't know it was 2020
or something in those games it was crazy
but
yeah so you mentioned they losing two or
three million and it's we just got this
point there I didn't think there was a
big down in your career that we could
talk about but it feels like you was
brushed over that like it was nothing
yeah 23 million and we move on did that
not affect you did it creates how do you
how do you deal with a swing of that
nature you said 25% of your assets that
time see yeah for a lot of people that
would be a bit of a traumatic experience
that would be a peak law they remember
that I go oh my god when I lost that
much money it was a big negative for you
you kind of brushed over it as a uh bit
inconvenience need to move some money
around no big deal why do you feel like
it didn't affect
you to be H I was playing like four Siz
so I have still have some some bankr all
all other sides so I was I was making
good money on other sides and
and I think it was less than 25% of B
but
yeah but
yeah so I just took my shot I know I'm
plus I I just lost it and now I have a
situation do I sell some assets pay some
tax EVs and just try to grind it up back
up or I go to other s side try to grab
them my Ving and it's and I I might get
some hate from people for like talking
like that or something because this
feels like bragging or ignorant but but
yeah I just lost it and uh whatever next
like next day next two days after okay
we go on Asia we go on GG we go Poker
Stars we gr out this does his thing and
he and he cashed in and good luck to him
I guess so that's that that was it
basically not not much more to that yeah
you said I took a shot that was plus a
and it unfolded as did here we are no
big deal get on with it it's a a very
very strong mindset I think it's very
obviously the money we're talking about
is very high but I think a lot of
players listening relates to the swings
they take for their stakes and how it
feels to lose a part of your bank rle
and yeah that's that's pretty much what
you need to reflect on you took the shot
it was P to be hopefully in your
interpretation and move on and I think
lot people struggle with that you don't
struggle with this which is probably why
your friends said you're a natural stoic
because the stoicism is that kind of

without further Ado let's continue
chatting with
grav reney for yourself can you picture
any big swings you've had and being able
to brush them off as casually actually I
can relate to uh
um what grees was saying about I didn't
like to lose therefore I I come in very
prepared I was like yeah that was
exactly what I would do like I would try
to optimize everything to minimize only
the slightest chance of a big down I
remember throughout my career I think
the biggest down spring especially you
know when I was like peing Peak years of
my career I don't know what the big
biggest down swing must have been but
maybe 10 10 bance 20 20 would be pushing
it
and you know some people are listening
like you you you ran very good sir I
mean it was maybe like 800k hand sample
so sure we we could discuss that but I
feel like if you really come in prepared
and you know and you you never get
caught by surprise by your opponents
because you literally know what they're
going to do you know exactly how the EV
is going to flow to you you're very much
in control you know when when you don't
feel like it you know you always check
in with yourself like am I going to be
playing my best you know when to quit
you know which games to jump like I
think a lot of what grass was also
saying is like managing the swings right
you know which games to sit which games
not to sit when to sit when not to sit
so there's so much more that goes into
how you can reduce variants I think
grassby also mentioned short stacking
into certain games if you take a shot
only play when when when the game is
great right when your position the fish
is great there's so much things you can
do to to manage your down swing or for
example you know if you took a bit of a
hit yeah move move down once St be beat
up the guys at the lower stake one day
get your confidence back and move up
like there's so many things that that go
into it so uh I I can definitely think
about if you have me like uh uh Rock
baller moments these were more earlier
in my career when you know I was I was
inapt in makeup and uh uh a lot of
financial pressure you know having to
pay the bills with with the money that
you make that was very stressful time
but after I managed to grind out of that
no then after that there were no uh uh
big big down swings that uh that I can
uh I can recall so I can definitely
relate to what Graz is saying here um
graby I'm I'm I'm curious you mentioned
uh uh that you traveled for eight years
you were living out as a SASE uh now
this is obviously a lifestyle that for
example when I got into poker I did like
something similar actually we didn't
cross path with I cross path with some
of your friends in Rio as well traveling
around with with some of my friends uh
uh
it had it ups and downs do you maybe
have like some tips and advice in your
eight years of traveling experience for
people listening who like oh I would
also like to travel the world and play
poker it can I know in my experience it
can sometimes sound a bit more romantic
than than it actually is obviously it
has ups and downs could you maybe give
some tips around how to do this properly
uh with all the experience that you have
first couple years it was really
exciting this is so yeah I think I meant
to meet those guys and Des
when I was like like 21 year 21 years
old
so and it was almost like my first time
davel like and and even though I could
write in English very well like my
accent my accent was like like I have
very very strong accent
and I was quite ner the kid I could uh I
was like speaking very fast so yeah like
like yes so even I could write in
English very well like but my speaking
like a lot of people like say oh you
speak too fast we can't understand your
action is so like so difficult so yeah
like even even like it took me like some
years to adjust to it
but but yeah it was just so exciting to
go to a new place like meet new people
we we have people like similar people
it's doing similar occupation and I
guess probably my mindset is kind of a
little bit similar too
so no it's just it was like just a nice
crowd to crowd to hang out with and
those friends has to be friends and you
have like all there's like at some
places where it's like 10 people 20
people like maybe 30 people Circle right
but it depends how much you extend and
uh yes so first couple yes I wasn't even
thinking I was I think in most places
for Visa you can show up with your
passport you get Visa hour 19 days so
you just stay like almost three months
and you moved another place and almost
three months and you move another place
but
uh yeah after yeah after couple years of
of traveling that man it's kind of oh
you have to fly again oh yeah I have now
do I have now to book airb be like oh I
need to look for a place to live where I
have to back on my like paring station I
need to find another airbn be
so yeah at first exciting but after you
do it you do it for so long it becomes
almost like oh a routine and at some
point because oh it's not actually so
comeni it's just staying one place and
just having your own base and just and
also maybe just making relationships in
one place and and instead of traveling
because also you travel with some some
people but sometimes some people like
don't want to travel anymore and stuff
and or we get all like maybe older and
they say one place not all there but
like we get a girlfriend we want to live
here you don't want to travel anymore
and yeah
so but but also like in
2020 it it like a CO year so it was kind
of yeah like just uh jump jumped off a
bit but yeah 2020 I was just 2021 most
most of the C years I was just yeah just
stay the but even even if I was
traveling I like I was still staying a
lot lot a lot inside my inside my house
just grinding out you know and just
playing poker so but
uh yeah yeah guess for young person
young people if if I think it's it's
probably exciting if you just if you're
s in Europe and and maybe somewhere from
cold there maybe like northern Europe or
Eastern Europe or whatever Scandinavia
yeah maybe maybe it's fun to just know
go to Thailand go to South
America maybe you don't need to do it
all year all year around but
maybe go for winter season or go half a
year and half a year home I mean as if
you're a poker player area and you're
still young maybe you haven't even
bought a house you don't even have a
house maybe like you just rented
somewhere and yeah it's easy to you
cancel rent and you I'll go travel now
and so it all was very exciting and a
lot of a lot of fun I
guess throughout your in your
conversation with Adan uh the power of
curiosity came through I think
throughout this conversation in general
right you're always looking to for ways
to improve and that curiosity leted you
to work with a a coach I guess we could
call it that was very specialized in
Game
Theory what was like a big aha moment
that that that you got from working with
this guy and what do you think are some
common mistakes players make because
they misapply or don't understand Game
Theory
properly maybe some situations like he
showed me some
situations like there is a situation
there
is like if you're playing K and someone
and and you see someone as someone makes
a mistake and you say you choose to
exploit
them so you gain like say
EV one unit of year but if they see it
and they counter exploit you like they
gain seven units in the you know so
there's some situations that the exploit
with counter exploit is like not
proportional payout know or something so
like I remember I was writing down some
storys like oh this is maybe this is
like two to one to exploit
but this this one okay I he might be Mak
a mistake so I'm exploting him but every
time he want to he want readjust and
kind of exploit me like the maximum like
for every export I do he that's like
seven days so I need to be like seven
times right and he needs to be only one
time right so
yeah so maybe the people are like just
playing a game of a cut a mouse you know
so you need to remember like where's
yeah so it's not everything is like one
to one you know like also where's like
if you do it Sol ver you can kind of
measure or
like like I think the most examples the
examples that the guy was given like
from No Limit I don't know Play No Limit
but but like for structure of a game
like and the situation so
yes so I think in some it's good to
explore like if you see some Tendencies
but like but where's the people just
always play a cut c mouse game and I
think you if you if you cannot rely on a
the and just like you know where's your
treasure go or like Sol the game plan I
think there's so so so many M like and
people just start cutting slow you know
I mean you can get get shot quite fast I
don't know but if it makes
yeah yeah I I can't really this so if if
I understood correctly uh for example
let's say I have a good hand and
therefore I scroll up my sizing a little
bit to get a little to squeeze out a
little bit extra value right you could
say okay that makes a little bit more
money because you know he calls a little
bit bigger bet but if he finds out that
if you have something you scroll up a
little bit or SC and when you don't have
it to scroll down a little bit the
counter exploit is quite expensive
that's kind of what you're what you're
referring to or do you maybe have a
practical example yourself of something
that you were maybe misapplying and then
change after you learned
this like like I don't remember exact
situation but I think it was more like
referring
to not to the sizing but to the action
taken more like in a river if say
someone check races you or if you if he
bets and he thinks he Bluffs too much so
you're going to check race and bl re
Bluff him because he's profitable but if
he want time counter exploits counter
adjust to you and he doesn't it starts
under bluffing you and you start like so
you lose like seven times you to one so
there situations like where it's like on
the river especially like like if you
play like always get a mouse game and
you just think oh this this this is like
too much doing too much and you're just
like so so it's good to know you can
adjust and I was looking to to adjust
but some situations like that payout I'm
not very proportional I guess or
something if it makes sense sounds like
a a risk reward type yeah risk reward
yeah guess but I didn't have the H
moments like with with this guy but but
the thing what I I love I like so much
about him
is I think this guy's probably was like
even smart like I'm kind of smart but I
think his py is probably smarter than me
like you know I think he's found like
like like like some like crazy like like
computer Professor or something or
engineer or something too
so I think he just like maybe with fing
with performance or he didn't like CL
sper so much or something
but but I think he was like smarter so
so I think we we talk with same language
and I was I was already like aware of a
Content but he's just like a smarter guy
and he could navigate or he could he
could like leak plug leagues on my game
find leagues and stuff like that so but
I was also like studying with some other
people like friends of friends that
would put it the same group and stuff
but other people they they wouldn't even
asking questions they would wouldn't
even watch my videos because we always
interested in him but like I had so much
fun to watching all videos like trying
to pick all our mindset and stuff so
yeah I don't know I I just was always
curious about that those type of games
and those type of situations and
whatever mindset
yes yeah it seems very in line with what
you also said right that with for
example the mathematics of Poker you
were really trying to understand I think
you mentioned it the structure of Poker
like how how is poker structured what do
you think are common
mistakes that people make because they
misunderstand how poker is
structured I'm not sure to to be honest
there's lots of ways to like I I saw
also a lot of couple exposive players
they do very well
but like like like like I I don't know
it like how do we explain it but it's
yeah I was just trying to figure out
what what there was like okay where
where's like linear ranges for polarized
ranges how much we can
bet which board is better for which
player and if someone adjust to this
what is the right adjustment and how
much you can adjust and stuff like that
I was just considering time to
premeditate those type of things and uh
we I was to conceptualize premeditate so
I'm prepared so I'm not like I'm com
like so when
I I always like enjoyed it because but I
feel like oh I learned one thing so I
don't need to go back after I learned I
already have it so I can just build
another step and after that I can build
another step so I feel like or like even
if a player pool changes I'm still like
oh everything I did before is still
useful and I can just keep up from that
same place and just keep going you know
so it's I just like
r r mindset like with suit me well I
guess over years for most
part if it makes yeah if you build a
very very solid structure right around
around Theory mathematics things that
will always hold in any type of
circumstances I think that also really
helps in terms of you know you said you
always consistently showed up in terms
of volume right even if you would play
your B orc game if that fundament is
there right the theoretical fundament is
sound then you know you will naturally
also have less swings because your
fundament is sound and therefore you can
grind more volume also on your B and
your C game you did however mention
earlier in the conversation that I think
it was when you were moving to 2550 5100
where you also started to see more value
in playing offense right in being a bit
more exploitive also the player pool got
smaller so you got more reads on players
do you recall any any exploit where you
were like hm this is actually solid risk
reward right because you kind of
mentioned it's like ah exploitation you
know a little bit too at sword because
yeah you gain a little bit but you can
lose a lot of your counter exploits do
you remember uh like some exploits that
come to your mind that you were applying
that you do do think is good risk
reward I I mean High St players already
know that but a lot of the people were
just like too passive or falling too
much so to be honestly a lot over years
like just betting more and it was
working very well like being more
aggressive with some checks and you and
uh a l even against the population like
just if against checks you bet more and
it was working very well to be more on
aggressive size with with bats and
uh playing a bit bigger percentage of
the PO I guess when when we like I don't
know I don't know how my PO on it but
yeah just trying to capture bigger
percentage of a p but but mostly because
people were like a bit more passive or
we have weer checking ranges that was
working quite well to be honest
yeah
so but yeah but but but I still didn't
adjust so much I think like I always
only just like last couple years but
like but uh but but yeah yeah so yeah I
think overall just I know think I want
to put it on on to like Po all but yeah
I guess that was where most people Le is
we just like over folding especially We
All Fall we falling 7% reverse and you
know you know what happens when someone
4 7% reverse so it's it's a spot so
that's that's what the biggest leaks but
yeah yeah especially if you can maximum
that pot folding 70% of the river seems
like seems like a pretty pretty
significant leak now obviously there's a
lot of differences between No Limit
holding and PLO something that I want to
get into but it sound from the sounds of
it if we talk about exploit and just the
natural tendency of people like in
Holdem it's the same right people you
know usually they overfolded yes
checking rang are often a little bit
weaker right they're less protected
people are a bit more greedy and they
kind of front out their aggression let's
say you have a solver that would delay
their aggression with certain value
hands especially your vulnerable ones
you know people will frontload them in
bad B check or uh bat check instead of
check bat so these are like I think very
like certain tendencies that very well
between holdam and om and I think in
general right when you talk about the
structure of the game and how Poco works
and kind of you know the forces of
equity and all that type of stuff like
really fundamental uh uh structures of
Poker I think there are a lot of
similarities between the two if we talk
about differences over the years uh you
know many many No Limit Holden players
have have transitioned to PLO I think
Mikey boy fin L is you know to call like
two of the more successful ones that
have done it what do you think are like
common mistakes that no limit Holden
players make when they go play PLO four
car PL in this case right we're talking
about yeah the two guys you mentioned I
think they play more like heads up
and man in head up cring it
and I don't know if they had any
structural mistakes or anything I think
they were just playing pretty pretty
good treas and stuff maybe they missed
like hand or too like exact hand to do
it
but Al also both of them pretty show
better heads up now so anyway so it's
but yeah like before I was I was
listening to the the Apollo podcast that
you guys like did like two years ago and
he said he played with lios and stuff
and yeah and he was very impressed with
this game yeah so yeah I know lers did a
very well against quite a few like BL
guys so yeah it's
just but
um yeah a lot of guys a lot of guys were
able to transition like successful to
six Max but a lot a lot also didn't able
to transition like that depends if they
came like I guess I know there's a
couple names that we came we weren't
really able to beat L limit so I decided
to to be low so I didn't evolve I'm not
beting but no limit I'm transition to be
low didn't work but but if we were like
getting bored of No Limit and weing no
limit but we able to like transition to
P if tradition P like from being like
strong play a lot of them were able to
like dial in pretty well
and I think the structure is kind of
it's pretty similar like with the the
equ of hand bad and stuff it's it's I
think the game structure is like prly
similar to like there big there probably
two big big bad games and uh all the
same Concepts apply like similar you
just need to figure out maybe slightly
thresholds or slightly blockers and
that's
it somebody just said what's interesting
he said okay if the guys were already
crushing at No Limit and they just got
bored and they want to try PLO these are
obviously the guys that will do a little
bit better in there is also like a
little lesson you know if if things are
maybe not really going your way in your
current format sure there is a chance
that an other format might just suit you
better but often than not just changing
formats because one format is not really
working maybe you have to kind of change
your approach towards towards poker in
general right just switching formats is
maybe not the solution these guys that
do switch formats and they didn't make
PL work what do you think they usually
get wrong when they transition from nor
limit hold to PL why why doesn't it work
for some of
them well we we probably already have
some quite quite a bit like some
weaknesses in the old game right we we
probably had good enough like
fundamentals or structures or or
whatever we put in less less effort from
other guys so yeah like if you like I
don't want to mention names but some
guys I know like like also when like my
people in po like where was like
scripting days so where like like some
biggest scriptures but they have four
win rate and no limit with oh I add
another game PLO and transition but they
were like weakest players the table
still
so yeah yeah depends if if you love a
game and you're very good in your game
and I don't know how many po guys are no
limit but but there's quite a few No
Limit guys that like try to play p and
lots of them had like pretty good
success and very successful and very
good players I don't know so but he also
we but this is Al I'm talking like 25 50
plus 5100 so we saw already you know
this is like high sck players and we've
been around for a long time so we just
I'm sure we're just a smart guys and
it's yes it's quite impressive go going
we have some of them yes
and to be honest a lot a lot of them
probably played better than than the BL
guys I was used to because they were a
bit better like fundamental there where
they were trying to protect the checking
rages a bit more we like we we're trying
to like defend everywhere like one Manus
Alp a bit more than so a bit less like
like just
simple like like uh how do you say like
simple like I level mistakes where you
can just all point B point and just take
advantage off so yeah
but you you played mainly uh uh or at
least for the majority the majority of
your volume in your career has been six
Max you also do play heads up PLO when
did you first mess around start messing
around with heads up and which which
format do you like better six Max or or
heads
up I'm not really sure probably six Max
because just relatively better six Max
six Max when heads up
but the the thing heads up
tables like when I remember I was moving
moving up in POG Stars was my most when
I was up to 2550 it was on POG stars and
back then we still had like we still had
you know like like a heads up tables and
each steak we had like six six open like
it wasn't king of a lobby but it was
like oh like two for steak and have like
six seats open so I was ready trying to
hop in to everyone was like waiting
there was like 50 people wait 50 tables
waiting the tables for like guys to show
up so so I was trying to bounce off my
weakest players I was already like
thinking oh which one is the weakest one
of this maybe like so I I you see who is
not playing who so I trying to bounce
him off or like play a little bit so so
I was always like mingling between both
games because I knew that heads up like
you don't play so many hands but for
wies are so crazy so like if you get
like just recreational player come to
have fun with you and just play so
it's yeah basally my whole career I was
just bouncing a little bit but TR to
jump into heads up and study a little
bit St thresold
but and play some RS too but uh yeah
like I I was never like never really on
on the top guy maybe like couple years
ago I was almost like getting maybe like
top five or something but
but yeah but but it's also hard
transition between two games know
because you cannot just study six Max I
put all an edge of playing six Max but
also like study heads up it's like it's
too much to spread around
but what are the what what the biggest
adjustments you have to make if you
transition from six Max to heads
up heads up just wider wider ranges and
uh and from heads up players I hear
themselves like I think heads up guys
like they be more happy to play like
against your opponent maybe like find
the exploit explor more like adjust the
Dynamics and in six months I think
you like you
always I think there like you have like
more players to pick so we can for me at
least for me I could not like oh I know
I have 20 play your player pool so we
have I play a couple tables I can
remember all this guy doing worse on
worse but on most situations I'm just
going of going automatically because I'm
not going if I'm playing four tables I
cannot really remember oh this gy turn
so it's kind of hard to remember you
know everything or like so
yeah I think that you can just maybe
just focus a bit Focus maybe a bit more
on your opponent just his Tendencies and
some adjustments and how how you with
his game matching and
uh yeah I guess there bigger difference
and know you also play way more hands
pre flop so yeah it's like I don't know
you said playing 85% of has be FL set of
six Max you know
but but the rules are the same so I
don't know it's it's the ru
so betting rules and everything is the
same
though I Saw You Dropped a a power
ranking on two plus two not that long
ago on this list you ranked yourself
second at six mix p l and only lost the
buas AKA omaf for rules which you have
been mentioning as well uh uh kind of
succeeded you you put it in first and
for heads up it was Barry sweet who for
you was clearly the goat uh what is it
that makes you rate these two guys as
like the best and what makes them the
best like what what do they do
differently than the rest that makes
them so uh so hard to play
against for all in six M I think he won
the most money to be honest but also
with was comp poker gam so that's why I
put him first I think maybe in tactical
game if you go all at like 40 B blinds
60 B blinds B FL 100 B blinds uh I think
maybe I'm better than him like in M but
I also played for all quite a bit heads
up and and I lost against him heads up
so I feel I feel like oh this guy won
more money against me in six Max overall
but he also beat me heads up so I can I
canot put myself in front of him now so
I have to put him first but so that's
for
reason and yeah yeah it's quite good if
heads up against at least against me
like he he won money
so and bar is bar is just a yeah I don't
even dare to talk about this like the
best Heads Up Guys knows because I think
this guy beat every every guy heads up
and he beat every PL guy heads up so
like like it's it's it's just unnown
truth I think he started with PL he beat
everyone PL and then do no limit and one
get everyone No Limit he want against
everyone no limit so
it's and he keeps on going right uh I
think in your in your top three I think
it's the Barry Sanita then and I'm so
good if I'm not mistaken top of my mind
and then and then then these three guys
are battling up with each other they
must also have like a very very very
competitive mindset right they must just
be sitting there waking up every day
like oh they must be living their life
man they must be enjoying
this
yeah Al I know like San is younger at
least but I don't know when I was moving
up I know bet it was already like at the
highest St when I was moving up playing
like two two four or something so I
don't know so this guys like for 10
years he just beating everyone down like
everyone comes anyone wants anyone can
get it so it's kind of yeah it's pretty
amazing I don't
know it's it's pretty like intimidating
to like even like consider playing him
not not not that I could play because I
know there's like seven guys in front of
me but but I need to beat first get
right but yeah through your career uh
you already managed you already uh
um mentioned you know be prepared you
work on youra game you study you
surround yourself with the right people
you mentioned solvers a couple times
what for you have been you know looking
back what for you have been some of the
most efficient ways for you to work on
your game delegating stuff is pretty
nice I know I know for for for the lower
guys lower stage guys but just moving up
is it's not very easy to do that but
uh yeah BAS from throughout most of my
career I had like two two full-time
coaches and
uh even even thought I could do
everything with solvers myself you know
like I I know how to run solver know how
to open Sims
everything but I still had like one guy
so basically the guy he was coaching
Theory but he also he he was po player
himself so he can go to your doctor base
he can look up hands he can narrow spots
he can see
oh you're not winning here enough or
whatever your percentage winning has
here is not enough
and then he can find it he can give you
drills to plug in those leagues so I was
paying in small percentage of winnings
so he he did a very good job on me but
but but also like another guy he was
like
U before that he was play he also
playing P side the lower but he was also
like coaching side so we he kind of he
could coaching site and he was Co coach
on a coaching site
so so he just basically with
the would run run SIM for us and would
make us presentation so so like oh a qu
session and I know like he he cook like
maybe one video and or like video on
Excel a week and and every week or like
or twice twice a week and and I just
watch like one video of one hour video
but but but is like probably like five
hours to coaching you know so like it's
like narrow or look you have six monks
cut off situation cut off against big
blind out of position to turn River for
both players you go Buton against andp
like and and so yeah dedicating a little
bit of your stuff like for other people
to do it like if you can do because like
before that I was watching some some
some of our coaching videos myself but
like since I was like 21 22 years old
I think I can do all thing like better
study myself but also if I can dedicate
it you know my time like just pay
someone to do it for for me and uh and I
didn't I didn't do it by myself like
some of my friends also to find find it
like with coaches and it's good for him
we getting like paid but they also play
like a bit lower so we also learn from
what what you what you saying your
mindset so yeah like like like like some
just delegating some of the like
coaching stuff is was was very useful
because if he can put me if he can like
narrow like five five coaching like over
running Sims
and and like preparing just narrow down
like five hours of work to one hour or
something and you just watch it so it's
like it's much more condensed and like I
know it's I think it's much more eff
efficient and I probably might might get
a lot of ha for this but yeah that
that's that's the way I did it so it's I
don't know I mean it this is this is
this is definitely uh Next Level smart I
don't think I've heard anyone mention
something like this on the podcast so
from what I understood maybe for some
people also listening maybe they play
mid stakes and they don't have a coach
and now they hear like one of arguably
one of the best if not the best six Max
PLO player plays the highest stes you
said basically throughout your career
you always had a coach and it seems like
is it also like some accountability
basically it sounds like you just sent
him over your hands every month he just
runs runs it through his database check
and kind of sees if your game where
where your game might slack off so is it
also like some sort of accountability SL
awareness because like often you know we
might find out a leak but we find out
pretty late right but with having this
coach full time it seems like they can
make sure that you stay on the right
path yeah and there is still a lot of
situations like to to study so I have
six mons to study I want to study heads
up I want to
and and also I think this guy is
just he's probably enjoying more to like
go through solvers for you or like go
through database for
you and and you and even if as a good
player you're still like you have a
blind spot so you have like Tendencies
where you too passive too aggressive or
you or you just do things but you still
like there's things you you don't even
know it exist but this guy she oh where
is this this thing you know this line
this line you know Tak advantage or this
is what's happening and then and then
also if if as the same person can just
also give me drills to to same situation
I mean you're just going to improve for
quite fast so yeah like I I could if I
didn't have him I could research it
myself too because like I I know how to
run over things and stuff myself and and
look up for database I guess but or all
hold the manager and stuff and go for
filters
but if if someone can do it for you I
mean I was able to find someone to do it
for me and and I think the guy is
actually smarter than me I think if if
if he had to play chess or something you
know learn so I think I think he was
smarter if he did like two I think that
guy smarter maybe a little bit so so
it's I mean it's quite impress if he can
have some smarter than you but maybe it
doesn't like maybe maybe he has anxiety
for poker or something to play himself
so he can do it for you I mean it's it's
I think it's like big Edge but so it was
pretty nice I me
I'm so it sound like obviously you know
in my head sound sounds great let's say
for example I would have Lon is review
my hands you know that would be great
that's usually what people think about
the coach right they think okay I need
to find someone who plays higher than me
who's better than me but obviously
you're already one of the best and
you're playing already super high so you
always have to sort of look down the
stakes to find a coach but it sounds
like what you're saying also is that
people kind of get the wrong maybe you
should look down a stake and there's
guys that might even be better than you
or maybe at least better from the study
side or like you said they like the
strategy side way more than the playing
side is that kind of how you teamed up
so you might think that this guy maybe
has more potential to be even better
than you but he doesn't like to play or
you know his performance habits suck or
you know like I said he has anxiety
around playing is that like how do how
for like our audience listening and
maybe for me myself as well like if I
try to find someone like that on my team
what is the type of profile that I'm
looking
for I think maybe I just toy to PID I
think I I paid like 20 20% P throughout
my career to these coaches I I like
there's couple other guys for but we
didn't play so much he play blow stes
but sharing my same coaches but I think
we justify it or like say I say okay
iidea myself how efficient I can be and
I think oh
we probably by by having them maybe my
yearly V like 40% you know something so
for me like first late or something know
or 20% or something so yeah I always do
that
but I think I just got lucky with this
guy because this guy is just I don't
know if there's any better better guy in
a poker ball I don't know I know no
limited guys like this Ella guy or
something that's very smart and everyone
is just talking about him
so so I guess I just found a guy
but that's not not on like YouTube or
not so popular maybe just or or or maybe
he just loves loves the game of poker
like in a theor aspect but he doesn't
want to play so much but yeah he was
always just happy to to like coach and
answer questions and was always scos
and and yeah a guy himself probably
smarter than me so like just just it's
just perfect opportunity if he doesn't
want to play himself but and he can get
PA a couple 100K a year or something
from coaching and I make couple M so me
it's it's I mean it's it's I think it's
like it's it's you know you know it's
plus to be deal for both
so I don't know what to say about it
more but it's yeah it's no it sounds
like maybe some luck I don't know it's
you know it's probably quite a bit of
luck maybe sounds like a good deal and
then from what I understood let's say he
finds a leak you said you get a
presentation so he basically spotted
like some leaks or maybe you sended him
like some hands where you're like H not
really sure how this situation would
play could you maybe find it out for me
and then he basically goes into the lab
and gives you a presentation on that
spot is it kind of how I how I
understood it
correctly yeah after session I I just g
a screenshot some hands post and send
him or maybe POS in like little group
chat and a guy looks looks it
up but like but like biggest hands going
for bigest hands probably not the most
efficient way of studying to be
honest like like I I think right now
there it's
like in PLO like I don't know name is
but I think online like we have like
online we have you have drilling stor
just know can open like cut off against
B blind so so so if I had a coach I
think I would just go like drill a lot
of situations like and I would start
from my most common ones like single
race B like button against big blind for
both
positions button get MP and then single
race and three B those type of
situations and I I would just drill but
yeah but like couple years ago also OB
service like are kind of slow so I just
was like like I was able to do it like
uh yeah just D myself more like
efficient know but like I I don't know
if I'm getting invited in any private
games for for like talking like that but
like it's just yeah the way the way I do
it but
yeah you you men you mentioned drilling
a lot obviously to drill you first need
to know which type of strategic approach
you want to take like in the solver you
can input various various sizings
various ways you know and it will kind
of out Ru the tto strategy how does the
process of strategy creation look like
and how do you come up with what for you
are the strategies that you actually
want to play and start practicing
I say heads up maybe single SP situation
so first you need to recognize the board
and maybe get a get an idea oh this is
this is more like 70% betting frequency
50% frequency % so and then we just kind
of nrow from where and okay it's 50% B
frequency okay so we going to need to
mix quite a bit and and you never I
never get you never going to remember
exact hands but you you
canot you know which gun a betting and
maybe like the strongest hands maybe we
have some certain blockers so you need
to check back for for a
balance and which are better hands
blockers as bluffing and what candidates
and then and you just take from there
and then you get in situation turn
situation and then out the position
responds right and you you have a
decision again did it we better or did
they check and when narrow down and and
you're try to try to win the p a bit
more often when your opponent little
more efficient R basic C I don't know
the secret to Poker
guys really with the PO the opponent bit
more efficiently a bit bigger pot
preferably so you mentioned already you
know like that you've identified like
obviously when you look at when you when
you identify the board to you estimate
the equities there are certain hands
that are quite clear then at some point
we get to like the mixes right like okay
these hands can kind of go either way
it's very hard to get it all right
that's also what you already said uh
where does uh uh simplification for you
come in and how does that look like in a
practical
sense the simplification to with coming
if if if I will look at an open end and
I will try to guess him okay so okay we
studing where situation I think this 50%
betting frequency I think the solver
after 50% betting is just folding
whatever 45% and then and when when I
think oh it's this opponent with Ty of
he is more sticky on SOL compare does he
raise more on solver and when I'll go
back okay this guy is too passive okay I
go a bit more this guy is a bit too
aggressive okay we maybe when makes
sense we go bit bit more past him and
stuff like that and and take him from
there so yeah so guess I would try to
remember with So Sol the TR a little bit
and then oh and how how we Sol to what I
do but I'm going to compare what what
does my opening do in my situation I
logically just going back and when you
can well do I need to be more aggressive
more passive and basically with mixed
hands I think that's where that's where
I would try to bounce around a little
bit and
uh and go further and maybe hopefully
your opponent has some big leagues
somewhere but as the highest stes not so
many of them have
and and and we probably and mean these
guys are probably studying more than me
too because like I I've been here for
eight years there some guys like we like
24 23 years old and they I'm a bit lazy
now but these guys are moving up and you
know so they they want to bring over
action they want to study a couple hours
a day and uh we are a bit more sharp and
get a bit more excited too like like if
we excited I'm po probably 9 out 10 and
mine's like five out 10 so I'm a bit
like I think I'm a bit falling behind
but not not too far behind in heads up
settings but six mon max if there big
games coming up I mean I would play but
yeah
but it sounds actually very similar to
uh to how I see mixes basically you
already mentioned right through through
through through Theory and understanding
the structure it's very hard for a pure
hand to go the other way right therefore
the leak in your opponent has to be
significant that the E would actually
switch that a pure hand do something
else where a mix hand then people kind
of run the G for example and they kind
of leave leave the the opportunity for
Edge they they don't grab the
opportunity for Edge how I see a mix is
like you know the AL solver gives you a
lot of answers but now he's he's
questioning you back he said I'm not
sure what to do with this hand maybe you
can figure it out right that's I think
how you should see it and then my
process is very similar like oh I have a
mix this hand can generate EV in in
either line let me see if my opponent
incentivizes me to take either line a or
line B right so a mix people just
straight away hit the RNG but people
should see a mix as an opportunity to
gain EV right because these hands are
not pure everyone does the pure hand
it's what you do with the mix and that
that kind of determines the EV that
you're going to
generate yeah yeah you you told me
better than me yeah May better yeah I
think it's basically simple as that but
the hard part will come like actually no
thres no my hands and uh and being able
like having good enough potential span
to execute it and uh and also if you
moving up in Stakes also just you know
there's going to be anxiety of moving up
in Stakes actually money moving around
and so you can always solers but you can
move up stakes and there anxieties
performance on side and stuff moving up
and and yeah and it it becomes like
executing it or like or and or maybe
your inner biases like
sometimes like I I know that people
like if I have like if if I'm I feel
like I'm getting somewhere and and
unnown I I tend to like a little bit
like not leash out I T to take more
aggressive action I try to raise or
something there like there's like no
also have some something like I think
I'm more like PR side if I feel like oh
someone is like here and I don't even
know the situation but I I try to exp
explore the situation by being not by
being more passive but by being more
aggressive I think like you also have to
like I bit know yourself too like you
know type of situation yeah it's like
your own biases
right yeah yeah I think so and it's but
it sounds very much in line with what
you kind of identified right as like the
general leak that people usually lean
towards over folding being too passive
under bluffing so then as a default if
you're in a situation where you're not
really sure what to do and you have the
option to aggress it seems like it seems
like the right the right way to approach
it you'll probably be uh more right than
wrong right when we talk about conver we
already touched a little bit about
frequency uh do you use RNG in your game
and if so uh what do you use it
for I I never use it like like like a
year ago I I did open like or Google
rator okay one to zero one to 100 and
and now I try to press a little bit but
it's only
because I I'm not getting good reads on
people or something so may maybe that's
probably bad sign because maybe game's
getting to T because I I would like not
to use it I would like to just have an
idea what people are doing enough and
just press a button so I don't really
think I'm using in any efficient sense
but but uh think like in in general do
you agree that uh I think RNG should be
lo used as a last resort so when I see
players on Lower midak use RNG I'm like
okay guys there's this you could have
you could have come up with an optimal
decision here you didn't you you didn't
need to use the RNG like I can
understand that if if grasby sits down
at uh 50 100 or higher PLO you know he's
probably playing against guys that even
the mixt they're not really incentivized
by by their opponent strategy right
because everyone starts to play a bit
more solid but if you play on Mid Stakes
I guess your recommendation would be to
to think a little bit deeper for
yourself and not spin the RNG too
often I think with n like first thing
just like oh do the guys even assume
that we know the strategy well enough to
even know where to use RNG like where is
the borderline hands so for me what I I
didn't for most of I I even was
comfortable that I I we know which
should be mixed like I know oh here here
but I can not even like you have
information like so it's always just
like I know this is more more less about
the line hand and maybe I look at oppent
what his
Tendencies yes so I think if you're like
playing like playing mid Stakes or
something yeah like for chances but you
you that you like uh that you know St
you're good enough but but to be over
but some
mixes I are pretty low but like yeah but
but if you try to figure out hand
and you you're probably much better
trying to look at your open and ask the
question yeah is this guy like calling
too much you falling too much much you
to take it it's this guy raising a lot
of hands is here ra never raising hands
like never check raising so I think we
better questions to ask and andone try
to figure out out hand because yeah
like that would be my advice I guess for
for my people but yeah I can relate when
and then and then sometimes you know I I
have a lot of experience coaching we can
maybe go into this if you have if you
have done some coaching as well and what
has your been your experience but like
from my experience then they say then I
would ask this question well you know
what do you know of your opponent what
do you know of your population they say
well I don't know I don't I don't know
and therefore they end up rnging so okay
well if you really have no information
but you used to have some sort of
information right you used have for
example your intuition you have
experience play in the game but let's
say you have no information then okay
yeah roll the RNG but then Mark this
spot and spend your study time or in
your case you would you would shoot your
buddy a message right hey I don't know I
don't know if this hand should go left
or right my read on this situation I
don't have a read in this situation can
you come up with a read you know can I
find more information either on my
population either on my opponent that
will make have that will allow me to
make a better decision a more informed
decision in the future instead of rnging
at this moment uh do you have any
experience by the way in that in like
coaching players I believe you did try
to do like a little cfp another a while
ago have you have you been taking some
students on what's what's so what was
the situation there yeah yeah but that
reminds me also like a little bit about
PR team team we talking about
MG yeah like I could not could not agree
with you more like yeah if you don't
know the SP like just also the way I was
learning like pre flop when the first
solers came out like oh solare came out
we can Sol a pre flop like okay I Sol it
for for bre of my games and when okay I
did some drilling but when I I don't
really know with 34 is it open not so I
just take a yzo screenshot and I take
one two days and I I have like 20 people
hands and I go check every P hand and I
open E what's the EV this is what's the
correct action and the EV difference for
folding or different from half far ways
from different action and then just like
okay I did like for one year B flop and
then just just d d pretty well so yes so
if you don't know the answer you
probably you shouldn't just try to nng
it but you just you should probably try
to like get an try to find an answer to
the situation firstly so I would agree
with that and yeah maybe just take G
screenshots or a screenshot and just
somehow folder it and then go back
through the hands and try to learn
that you you grew up a pre-s solver
error I think you only started to use a
solver uh you mentioned F2 actually
already playing high stakes do you
remember uh uh your your first kind of
introductions to solvers and what for
you has been like a big aha moment when
you started using solvers and that had a
big impact on your game and that changed
the way you approach it compared to pre-
solver I just like the fact
that everything interesting I would find
in solware I could it was all logical
like everything like everything is Sol
you find oh okay this is not this is
like new but you can still like figure
out logically like simple steps like
okay he isn't here but why because you
go back to the anges you go back so
I was always trying to pick up the
patterns and the biggest thing was like
like also think about Pok like so much
but how much you put effort is like it
correlated very linearly I guess to to
your like it it was not no person like
no it found no Superstition we just okay
I'm studying I'm getting better and I
could answer his questions
and yeah first M server which most
people use for for p
came out it's
like yeah we start started running BS
like I started running BS like and
preflow everything and yeah when I like
answer was like oh you can recogize the
patterns and everything was so
everything you can figure out logically
and when when you learn the patterns you
kind of can use it a little B
universally for situations or you caniz
situation maybe you do understand about
same situation but you kind of start
recognizing it a little bit more and
more and stuff
so that was bious at that moment so I
could just I would look at Sol but I
also try to figure out logically why
it's doing that what for ranges
and yeah but
uh so very like you already said
universally you were again looking at
the solver not to figure out if you
played your hand correctly but you were
looking at it at a bigger picture like
you know the structure of Poker how does
this how does this two you know Act add
to how I understand the structure of
Poker yeah because you're not going to
study every single spot you know but
you're still going to have to play like
thousands of hands and you're not going
to have studed every single spot but
maybe you can maybe you can reconize
like not I don't know pars or what's
it's called or like similar
situations and you just this is
different situation but you know this is
like what to studed and the parameters
of it like kind of similar so you can
the logic to figure out what more nice
you should do with your hand and so yeah
it's back part was very
nice in your conversation with Adam I
heard you dro the word feedback loop um
which I understand as the process of
improving as a player uh how does
feedback look look for you and how has
it evolved throughout your career
yeah you basically just put some out if
you can get an answer it's very nice you
know so like like I like I have a little
bit like self studying partners and
sometimes like you would be like or may
inv might some friend to join it but
this guy like feels like oh he doesn't
really want to read it or like keep up
with it but if you if if you can have
someone like maybe mes guys maybe you
can find some friend to like stud the
solers to together and then oh you just
ask questions you expose hands you try
to find an answer and and then you get
feedback to that hand or you kind
recognize the patterns and maybe maybe
you forget about it but your friend
reminds you and keeps you to that bad
place and and but the niest place is if
you can find like a I guess a a back
like some kind of structure where you
don't need to go back really or or if
you fall back you fall fall back on like
10% was but it's very fast to come back
and just you can just build on top a
little bit and I guess
and like I don't know if you guys want
to even cover like investing I was like
I don't like I just I I just put my
money like in S&P 500 and stuff you know
I I don't want to check it I never check
it so you just like like like I don't
like if if there's a face that a low EV
things but you have to put a lot of time
you don't want to do but I I would like
to learn a thing and I could keep it at
think for like 10 years or something if
I learn this hopefully like I want to
like learn a thing that's not useful
like in a half a year or something or
two months I don't know so if it makes
sense what do you uh what areas do you
believe are most crucial for players to
work
on every single aspect like I I never
started this like I never struggle with
um with a mental game I think or or like
tilt or anything but if you have tilt
issues you definitely need to like make
sure you not like make sure it most of
the days going to keep your game like to
a level or a minus you you don't want to
just jump to see see level games
but yeah just tryy try to study games
like keep
up don't don't talk too
much I guess sleeping good maybe is good
it's something you should do but
exercise
diet those are very important
but I mean if you go to
Poker like also like I don't know if
there is people that study 10 hours a
day but I don't think you need to study
10 hours a day like maybe it sounds like
I studied a lot of hours but I probably
study like maybe I don't know 200 hours
a year or something so it's not so much
like it's 200 hours a year it's maybe
what is like 40 minutes a day or
something like from care and even last
couple years I didn't studed so much
like but Al but if you if you learn a
little bit of structure of a poker game
itself like oh what what's
uh what are the rules like okay if you
open it's betting what's my response is
what what's the bet size is how much we
need to defend against it and uh who has
the better board maybe and and maybe
after that you going to build up a a
little bit with solvers and stuff
but and maybe learn Treasures with
solvers and adjust to your player pool
and figure out how player pools plays
how maybe some re on
opponents yeah but but probably also
like a lot of pocket players should
should try to D in like off off table
things like yeah get your diet right I
guess or and sleepy patterns because
without the performance you know without
feeling good I mean it's got to going to
be keep up a month of playing like like
a year of playing I don't
know I feel like of off the table work
is at least 50% uh of what brings a
success to a poker player you you
obviously you've met a lot of poker
players along the way I think you gave
one example of a guy whose game
selection was very poor right he just
kept on sitting 300 1020 ver the pass at
that stake while that's not really an
ingredient uh for success in your you
know in your surroundings looking at
people that didn't make it what do you
what what are like some common trends
that you saw Why by players filled and
and you
didn't to be honest I have a little bit
forign L with my my friend group a
little bit but but it's for a different
topic but one one one very interesting
like celebr thing celebrator thing is
that the people had met like eight years
ago there like eight 10 people everyone
like made it like know so it's like like
not a single guy didn't made it like
this guy but I was talking about I
didn't I didn't meet him real life we
talk on internet but with every single
guy met it's like basically for the same
Circle but did not everyone was like GTR
or something but they all like or like
or he didn't like or didn't stand it so
much or didn't like he had like a
mindset of like technical aspect mindset
but but everyone really made it for that
Circle but is it the power of is that is
that the power of just being around the
right
people yeah and maybe just me meting
like you know a lot of them already
playing with 10 to five 1020 maybe some
guys lower 510 but yeah I guess if if
you're around people maybe you don't
want to fall down so much you know I
guess or or maybe or if if you have 10
people around you want to still find the
feedback and if you respect someone and
maybe he can have smaller gr but if if
you think of this guy if he has like
already like four four four out of
things going on like you got good diet
SES well you start
this maybe doesn't doesn't like just
play completely games out of his league
and he won't maybe a young young D like
24 years old and he wants to keep up
here like oh I want this to be my
profession maybe that's the right person
for you to be around you know that you
find one of one or two or three people
around like that and you probably can
give give each other help I guess but
yeah yeah I feel like if the
environmental factors are set up right
then you know technical game is
something you you can work on right
unless someone is very risk Avers and
very biased towards paity and just
cannot aggress and just just cannot deal
with kind of the gamble aspect and the
risk aspect if if that you know if
there's not very very clear uh uh uh
sort of restrictions or objections there
then I think the technical game you know
everyone can kind of
learn are there any that in Europe opin
often overlooked or underr with ways to
increase EV as a poker player that come
to mind like some maybe or unorthodox
things that people don't necessarily
think about straight away but that are
in your opinion very good to increase
your
EV for example you actually mentioned in
the beginning right about the
Outsourcing I think you you talked with
Adam you outsourced a lot of things you
talked about adjusting sleeping times
based on when games are best that's
definitely I think one that we don't
hear very often for
example yeah my my friend wrote it but
I'm not sure if I really did it like to
adjust it I think that the game is for
best at night but I also like go out go
out party and know my schedule was
already like late so I go to sleep 5 in
the morning and wake up like noon or
something so I don't know if I did it
deliberately but yeah night hours a bit
better to play because was like in
historically was like more games because
a lot of people like just play more like
evening night hours in Europe
so yeah for me as a young guy without
the family without like any kids I don't
need to wake up early so it was pretty
convenient for me to just play like more
like evening hours night hours keep up
quite a bit of of
work but but yeah maybe if for your for
your games where it's like a place can
move maybe Thailand or something better
schedule or or or maybe there like heads
up Lobby and
uh and and like there's 12 hours that
like people occupy with heads up Lobby
and you cannot sit down but you want to
play heads up so maybe I don't know if
you're in Europe you can change your
schedule completely like different hour
differ to austr or something and maybe
you can just if you can if you you can
like afford living it of course but like
the expenses everything when traveling
but maybe like they play 5 10 and 20
just okay I want to play heads up but
this is like thei that you have maybe
can chase 12 hours I mean that would be
like very beneficial to like it's almost
like a game selection too it's you know
it's a
like Al a lot of effort I would put
throughout the years like is to be able
to like sit down tables like six ma like
like for six Ma you will be able to sit
only one or two players per table and
usually Mr gra joins and as stars and it
was like okay where it's like three or
four seats open so we get getting day
can and it was like 10 people on on a on
a waiting list you know so if you're
able to play like freehanded h up a
little
bit yeah I was I was always able to like
get in in the games but there like
there's people if if
you
yeah yeah I guess you need to also be
able to get in the game SL so that's
also like it's not a straight
straightforward aspect of just of just
uh I know it's not even when just
completely
skill I think some guys I heard
like they move like in UK to
live closer to like poker stars in Cas
servers they figure where it is and you
know talk about yeah and and maybe have
like I don't know I don't know what the
internet wi thing but they had like the
biggest one strongest one of them and
and they had the biggest script and
public script and C was still L they
just like jump in the SCP so it just be
able they R the best players but they
were able to get in all the games so
they but I think like now it's not not
really possible I think poker SI removed
at that time of option you not you
cannot really do it anymore but
yeah just you need just to you need to
figure out an angle to be able to get in
the games and find a way to make some
money yes yeah I it's like a it's like a
big mindset a very good uh study partner
of mine uh not now retired but I
basically did poker with him throughout
my whole career he had a very similar
mindset man he always F he always found
an angle he always found a way to
increase Fe and he fought very far
behind he did like basically every that
you said and then he went be beyond that
basically and on top of that you know he
was also a very good poker player he he
was like the best example of you know
thinking about how to make the most
amount of of of money in poker and I
remember I think it was Mexican if I'm
not 100% mistaken that that moved is off
men uh I remember that time also because
we were also trying to optimize for
script actually we we were actually
trying to build a a private script back
then me me and this buddy and I remember
it was always finished we gave that was
a German guy remember was a German guy
he build it for us you know almost
finished and then we showed him like a
site a similar something like to get
give him an idea and I think he was like
hey wait they charged like 500 bucks per
month for this when it was done he went
away we never got our products and most
likely he just took the product went to
the market and made a lot of money
that's why so a little bit scammed and
that and then afterwards actually I was
taking a subscription of a German guy so
maybe it was him that would would have
actually been quite funny but I remember
back then yeah you know that was part of
your consideration internet speed like
scripting all that type of stuff yeah
you were very busy with a lot of other
things then necessarily just improving
technically in order to make more money
in uh more money in poker Adam in your
opinion what is uh something that's
often overlooked or underestimated
that's actually a great way to increase
your evv as a poker
player I think grasis actually covered a
lot of the ones I would cover as well in
terms of the lifestyle and the way you
show up and there's a lot of small
things that make a big imp influence on
your overall performance like sleep for
example it's the most boring Topic in
the world to talk about but probably the
biggest performance enhancer your
overall lifestyle like Stress Management
how you look after your body in terms of
diets exercise I think are probably very
still overlooked on the whole from poker
players I think the high Stak circle is
more CED up on that and take it more
seriously but your average poker player
I think will kind of brush it aside and
go yeah yeah that's just not normal
stuff I don't I don't do that yet I'm
just playing pocket a strategy game see
I think those would be the the ones I
would um gravitate towards then also
just making sure you're fixing your
biggest mindset leaks that are impacting
performance whatever that is to you if
you tilt a lot big issue if you have
biases big issue if you can't get
yourself to sit down and play because
you're distracted you can't focus
there's a big issue so I think
understand for yourself what is that
biggest leak it's obviously most players
know this if they sat down for 20
minutes like right what has hold my my
back in my career they can come with
their top three things and then working
on fixing them in the best way to uh to
eradicate those those issues yeah and
then and then as well on top of that if
they already know but they don't fix it
is probably often that they're like for
example like you said at high stakes
people you know they approach it in a
different way or they approach their
health in a different way right they're
trying to show up the best way they can
because they have tough opposition and
then often if they know at midak like oh
you know I don't take my diet are series
I don't take my exercise cerity but
that's because I play midak and midak is
easy well guess what if you don't change
now right you have to start acting like
a high six poker player when you're
already at low six that's the only way
you can get to high six right you have
to become a high six poker play player
first and then you actually get to high
stakes it's not like oh when I reach
high stakes that's when I will start
take care of my diet or that's when I
will start to take care of all these
things no you have to do it now I think
maybe it's actually it's probably even
easier to do it other way around like
well like while was M up one two to four
like I would only play poker I would not
not watch any YouTube videos on our side
I would listen to music everything I
just it was only po tables and I was
here like rested FES with shower
whatever you know everything eat that
get coffee like just playing you like
know no music nothing
but yeah that that that's how you get
out of mid Stakes right and people are
like no yeah but I play mid Stakes so
why would I take a shower or oh I could
I could watch YouTube on the side and
play eight tables because it's only mid
Stakes
yeah yeah that's a trap right you you
get stuck there because you haven't
applied yourself fully and that's the
reason you're competing against the
other guys who are willing to go all in
and go to any angle they can to get Edge
and you're not going all in and you lose
to those guys and those guys outperform
you they get more efficient and you're
kind of half hearted I think that's
where a lot of players get stuck they
think they're trying hard but hopefully
listen to a conversation like this and
they go wait a second there's so many
areas that are look thinking about
because I'm not fully serious about what
I'm doing some players like yourself gr
V comes naturally you are obsessed with
the game and it just goes right how do I
become better it everything so I perform
better it naturally all aligns other
players need to be more intentional go
right I'm not I'm not sure the way I
want to that aligns with my future
Visions I need to make changes to
everything across the board ideally
surround yourself with people who are
obsessed with it surround yourself with
people who all the version you want to
be in are ahead of you you look at them
you go wow this guy is such a high
performer it motivates me to step up I
think that's a real way to get out of
your current environment or your current
situation to be in it environment where
people are obsessed with what they do
that often as gra mentioned will rise
your bond stop you falling lower when
things when things go stay so I think
it's a a good reminder so you mentioned
gr when you're talking to Renee about I
think exploits you talking about these
merge ranges and when you basically have
to go for a frequency player and you
mentioned the the importance of having a
good attention span in order to execute
your strategy so I'm curious to know for
you you played long hours you played a
lot of volume in your career how do you
make sure your attention span is really
sharp your focus is high does it come
down with these lifestyle factors or is
there any other things that really help
you to focus at a high level maybe also
maybe I have like some like OCD I but
always on PO was like I could never let
like or maybe it also comes down to like
a fearing know of like maybe not making
mistakes not focus enough to so I know I
ruce a little bit more energy for every
single hand but
uh but I was always like TR to keep up
like or like like a lot of people like
join on a table like other like we join
and uh it feels like oh I'm here to
maybe just Target or with Recreation
player or I'm not even caring not even
curious about this topics or this
situation I'm I'm let go go behind
easily or something there I was always
like just looking like it and it like
how do you say from the standpoint one
and I was like always trying to well
whatever I'm FL turn I'm keeping keep
trying to keep up what what's the anges
what's the action okay whatever I know
okay this is for anges was happening and
business response to business response
how I respond how much I can I
can I adjust somewhere and what what's
the proper proper amount to adjust do I
want to adjust like Mar SP or maybe
explore I just one3 m but I still C like
8% my V you know and you're always just
like oh what this is happening this
player it's maybe also maybe just
competition I don't I want I don't want
to let let this guy run run me over or
anything so I'm just going to keep it up
and know it's
and obviously there some hours to get
tied but like even if I'm get tied like
if I'm it's not like I'm movies on the
side I'm still like even have started
I'm I'm I'm just this is my interesting
this is my most interesting thing I'm
just like play playing a hand and I'm
trying to keep up because I know
tomorrow I show up and play the same
guys and I try to do better but I
already want to get my information
what's happening today like I want to
keep all information what's
happening that was super interesting how
you went through that so you mentioned
using more energy per decision and
keeping your mind engaged I think you
went through about five or 10 questions
for one spot to keep the Mind firing
keep the mind active I think this is
such an undervalued skill set where a
lot of players who've played five five
years plus for example will start to get
bored they mention autopilot they
mention okay I get distracted when I'm
playing because they're not keeping the
Mind engaged they're not firing away
with question after question depth after
depth in every spot they play in because
they feel like it drains them it costs
energy and they go to autopilot so for
you it feels like this is came you
mentioned OC D might being the driving
Factor but also like a u obsession with
performance what I get from listening to
you speak is a drive to perform high
level so is that the main thing that
keeps the Mind engaged for you just
wanting to uh play the best you
can yeah just probably like natural
compe as
you you're probably competing with a
couple guys around with your your same
level maybe like last couple years like
Oma for RS okay on AC there's like we
play six Max but there's only one one
person able to open with
a and it's like five six seats open so
like oh I I I don't want to watch the
lobby and maybe there regation joints
and I join after him so now like The
Game Stops and there's almost for all
and me and we have to figure out which
one is better us so who who keeps the
lobby and who goes to know budes with
able and maybe PES the game misses the
game so it's basically throughout all my
career like we had this just like okay
this is my opponent and gu for I lost so
may he was better but but uh like most
like eight or 10 guys like yeah I was a
lot of them retired some other guys that
like I was competing for years like a
lot like a lot of volum
like they're like OT he was playing so
much Vol and everything and and like
other other guys so yes but last like we
just like yeah trying to whatever like
like try to capture the most TV of
whatever whatever was available in
you're online and in an hour and try to
figure out the best fre to do it and
uh yeah and be efficient it I guess and
take part of it maybe a little bit
something like
that yeah you mentioned trying to
capture the most EV that is available so
for you do you have that same drive to
forkus a high level when you're playing
a soft table compared to playing the
best players in the world does is any
difference in how you focus or you you
constantly trying to make the best EV
decisions not really so if a table soft
and
sa some some regular and
uh I know it's quite a bit weaker and
and it's a rag so like I I might think I
have like I can go like two steps ahead
but I never but I never want to be like
two steps again you like just I think
being two steps again it's like mistake
I always want to be like one step ahead
you know this situation you cannot like
go like bounce back and forth like the
two steps like two steps you canot go
like there it's like so is
so like my station probably would be
like oh like there is one big whale and
there is like five good five top top top
V layers so I know well maybe like the
maybe losing he's losing like 50 100 so
we all make per 100 so that so it's
great because we all make make our but
but I want our players to be as strong
as as possible so is so I can go like my
full School set try to figure out all
like what's what's the lines so we
compete so so much and and I can use all
my skill set so like my ideal game would
be like oh it's like six9 game with one
massive well but like four other players
like the the best players available like
like that would be my ideal game like
but like playing like playing like 600
game with it not happens but like 6 game
with like slightly wash RS like it's
it's really annoying because like it
feels like oh you're not improving not
really you cannot copy so so many things
from him
like this is also interesting topic like
because from throughout my career I feel
like I was studying so much more so I
feel like I I feel like I could not copy
like almost anything from other people
at tables unless like unless exception
except a couple guys but it's almost
like feel oh it's me and my like my
things I learn of the
tables and and it feels like other guys
could copy F from me so I feel like oh I
do something for half a year or
something like or even some like simple
six Max like six Max situations but
there we have like we have some like
tables AC with 10 big blinds and there's
10 big blinds buying I don't know if you
guys know there
tables so we be like brief of Dynamics
and would be like some extreme scenarios
and and I Sol it I knew how to yeah but
like so I put all the effort but like
half a year later everyone kind of
catching up catching up catching up so I
I felt like I felt for me like to study
it would take quite a bit of effort or
like mental effort to improve it but I
feel like it's it's also easy to like
copy but if but you have to copy you
have to someone to you have to have
someone to copy from but if you don't so
like I feel like I was putting so much
energy but I couldn't have couldn't copy
from any ones to be honest but I I can
copy from Face from like heads up
players but six marks players it wasn't
many things to copy from you know like I
think my friends a lot of describe me
like I a great sponge like if I if I I
see someone
likes I see someone I like the person
does like I try to learn from it I try
to copy thing but in my six man fa I
feel like I didn't have so many
situations where I could copy things I
don't know if it makes
sense yeah it feels like you go your own
path and you got your own way of
learning that is unique to you so
copying kind of works from a learner
perspective but you can't just take what
somebody else does and just plug it into
your game you said that your dream
lineup is one whe and for world class
players why is that your dream lineup
and how do you feel like you gain more
Edge in that lineup than maybe other
players set at the same
table like I like two things in po the
things I I like is competition and I
like making money so so play play
mediocre re play mediocre re I feel like
I'm not like very mediocre but I don't
need beat him for so much but I it's I I
also feel like it's not so high
competition I'm learning so that's kind
of you know it's like it's not exciting
fore to do but but if I can have like
one B well just play just get spe your
money away and I can have like four play
four best players I to comp for so I can
get this station with these guys I can
get the Dynamics that this guy like
playing with 50% VP or something brings
and and you go off so trying to figure
that out so I feel like that's the most
exciting thing so you make a lot of
money but you also have like four other
guys that you have to stay at the same
level and try to figure out oh what's
going on here like what what you doing
are you exploiting me can I adjust
what's happening what's the right what's
the right Sol answer to the
situation the perfect plan of
competition and making money what your
favor is that's like yes
like like yeah a lot of probably a lot
of Po players in a poke ball
maybe I I feel like there's a lot of
Pock players but they there they help
but there's the population of people
that only had one of them
so maybe they just like to make money so
they try to get in good games they try
to bump F but there people that like
like I'm sure like G like diao that you
guys had before a few years ago I'm sure
he's like a competition guy because he
doesn't give TI to bum Hun he doesn't T
to CH tables doesn't TR to play many
hours when he comes to play he like
picks like opener are going to play him
heads up and how kind of similar skill
set so he likes the competition side and
he's just playing competition whereas
whereas I like I like both sides I want
to make as much money but I also like
the
competition like I to do more so I just
a lot of time I'm just end up like say
staying front of Compu like eight hours
a day or something 10 hours a day just
trying to get in games but but also ver
like competitive game or maybe player
too
so yeah it's interesting how you
mentioned that as well how some players
just want to make money with bum hunts
will often do very well financially for
a period of time but their game won't
develop at the same level and all of a
sudden the game probably overtake them
when the games get tough then there's a
guy who likes to R battle and play tough
lineups he's probably not going to make
the most money in his career but he's
going to get very very good at poker
then there's a sweet spot in the Middle
where you merge those two you're very
competitive but you're always trying to
make money you find that balance between
the two and you kind of optimize them
both at the same time which is a The
Sweet Spot for for most players I think
look at most players you honestly ask
them why do you like poker so yes I'm
comp competitive but also I want to make
money I don't want to come out of poet
in a bad financial situation so yeah I
think there's a a good balance there all
right I want to ask some reflecting
questions like looking back on your
career so far you've had a long career
you started very young what do you think
has been the greatest contributor to
your poker
success to my pocket
Journey the thing I Mak very excited
like finding right people like going
like traveling with places finding right
people and like you having similar
mindset and and like they feel like they
appreciate me like we go to Peach we do
that like being in a good poker Circle
it was very nice and
uh but but to have success I also I I
just really enjoy like poker game and I
feel like oh maybe with the one Pursuit
but but I'm kind of good at so maybe I'm
not so good at maybe I don't know at uh
public speaking or something so but I
feel like maybe I'm good at like board
games or something so I just you know so
it just like so it was also very
exciting to just explore over over the
or like trying to figure out you get put
in a PO like Po station any station flop
through and
opponent it always felt exciting or what
what's what I to answer here what's
what's what I to expon you said that you
likeed to meet new people and people
with the right the right mindset or
similar mindset what is it about the
right mindset for you what does that
Encompass for people you've met along
your a poker
Journey Depends for the situation right
it depends from what what
what you also just make friends and
stuff
but for poker
like the to to Poker I probably want to
like have someone like as competitive
like they don't need to play my Stakes
but but they probably need to have s
five mindset like I try to talk with
some people or people like with GTR
oriented or something and uh it was
mostly because we are friends of friends
and stuff and it it would never work
like I canot find like similar
conversation so we probably see see
angles for matter see by same angles but
but it's just we we we like we're not
like like uh how do you say we not like
overlap we cannot use like it feels like
we cannot in po sense we cannot like sh
like improve improve each other so much
but but when it comes to PO just like
like probably a lot of poker players
maybe we just or we we own town maybe
maybe we have friends outside poker
which might be PR beneficial some sense
but my friends were like
inside almost all them are like inside
of poke but they was traveling with
so so we we need to also try to solve
similar problems like oh what the right
set up how many screens to play like
where do logistical problems let's order
some good office chairs keep comfortable
and stuff like you know so or
like getting boring to grind maybe take
take a week off or something type of
friend I don't know yeah it's like
you're on the same path and you have the
same interest and you're overlapping in
terms of your dedication to Poker your
interest in it and your interest outside
of Poker as well some overlaps I think
they're the main things that lead you to
gravitate towards people to want to
spend time with them and also fun to be
around on some level as well um you said
there as well that you have been
naturally good at poker po has been one
of those games you picked up you're very
good at it compared to the things why is
that what do you think is about your
personality character traits that
allowed you to Jael so well with
po not sure you got can you guys me like
is for difference between me and you
could see between M player or what's the
difference between me and other guys so
what what do you say because it's hard
to self prescribe sometimes you know I
just do my thing and I try to compete
whatever's my player pool things
so yeah I get that it is some hard to
stop and go what has made me successful
it is some easier to compare because you
can not even got blind spots necessarily
but for you it's come natural so when
some comes natural it's like asking a
tennis player how to hit a good forehand
he goes just hit the ball and it just
flies down the line uh so there's the
element of just doing what you do and
it's it's come quickly to you I'll
reframe the question from a different
angle to have success in poker I think
you mentioned that you need talent in
our questionnaire to some level what do
you feel like you needs talent-wise
character traits in order to succeed in
poker they say in 2025 in a more modern
era do you need to be good at maths good
at solvers are anything things that you
feel like are crucial for a player who's
trying to strive and poker now to be
successful I'm I'm not sure I I just I
just hope a landcape going to be like
healthy enough for like 18 19 year olds
20 year olds coming
up because all my career like I was 20
years old my to some other guys would
say oh B is coming up in one year poker
dies I never believed it I thought oh
but I was actually
guessing like oh maybe SI remove high or
which actually happened but I I I never
felt like oh Sol coming up it's GNA it's
going to change the game because I feel
like we people that never started solers
or La before we not going to start
studying now so
it's yeah I just W like
it a lot of Depends of of like economy
of our field you know I don't know if if
if if if I'm bringing any good through
the economy of the field but but but you
know if there's like if it live poker
grows or online poker if there's like
good places to for young people to
compete if you want to improve improve
on skill sets and if players appreciate
it I mean I hope for po poker pocker SC
stays like available for people that we
just that that rake is good enough and
you can go and the games are soft enough
and there not enough games running that
you can have a chance to like grind out
and one two 2 4 3 six and
uh and make a Liv and and if it's not
online hopefully there's some live games
that you can go to maybe local casino or
on a casino in a bigger City or
somewhere like yeah like in your in your
in your own country maybe if a capital
city go move and go in a c there some
good games running or or go go go go to
Poker store cpts and and stuff I don't
know and grind Wills
out yeah I just I just hope like I
always enjoy po poker so I hope a poker
like their envirment stays he first
so so so that people that choose to to
make this the living out of this
profession we can just make a living
because you never you never know maybe
it's like the low stakes are like too
hard and there is like
maybe everyone just r or something but
like like I don't know the dyamics but
or everyone just or or or the poker size
just change from from pocket tables to
the some some play games like house
house B like a PO with a house b or
something it's that you know
so so those those type of friends I
think are kind of big threat for poker
but I would like to see a poker like
stay you know healthy and just people
grinding out from low stes to high
stakes yeah as you said there obviously
many threats in the future but right now
poker is very much still alive and there
are many ways that you can make a Liv in
poker different Avenues from online to
live to cash game to tournament Grinders
and it's find that path that resonates
with you that resonates your learning
style that you enjoy um and yeah I think
that's the the journey you need to
figure out for yourself which kind of
poke a journey aligns with you and you
how to uh put the time and energy into
it so for you looking back on your
career you've obviously done very well
financially what other ways has poker
had a meaningful change on your life
other than the success you've had at the
tables from a financial perspective
where do you feel like poker's had a
positive change on
you I'm not sure I I can translate man
poker skills to like live settings maybe
if I me to investing or something like I
like
that I think maybe not directly from
poker but maybe like studying talking
with some friends or or like or or like
hiring people to do like uh off table
work for me and I did it over very years
and I knew damic or you have to almost
like have to hiire people maybe I
learned where
but the biggest thing I probably enjoy
from me is like Financial Freedom maybe
just being able to live whereever you
want I bought my mama house and stuff
like that so that's nice and uh yeah
just those type of things
and but
where Pock skills would can relate maybe
to some investing stuff or maybe maybe I
can open like insurance insurance
company or something I don't know
where's my focus or
maybe running a training side or
something but besides that I don't know
in a
PO yeah you learn to be competitive and
and I I enjoy ende but it's it's a
little bit like I don't know what what's
the focus is it's a little bit like uh
it's always like entertainment right the
high St what there's like 20 guys or
like 30 and there like one guy wants to
come come play for Gamble and it's
basically you you buy entertainment you
pay for entertainment and we have a guys
to provide good entertainment play for
high stes or like or or go compete yeah
but it's B type of
think yeah I can think one thing which I
would add to that is for your Journey
what you've learned along the way you've
obviously learned how to learn like at a
high level like a really really high
level but I think a lot of people we
don't learn that because AS school we
get given a direction topics that we're
not really interested in then you finish
your education maybe do University where
you pick your degree again you just pick
what you're good at and at some point
you start going into the real world and
learn how to learn for yourself like
self-directed getting better or
something for your own sake you're your
boss there's no curriculum for you
there's no way of figuring out um a test
to pass it's like every day applying
yourself to get better I think for you
just listening to your story that that's
something that I've taken away from your
journey like the ability to learn how to
learn at a high level in an obsession
with your craft to uh to try and master
it and get better at it what is your
definition of success and how has that
changed over the years through your PO
career I still need to figure out yeah
what one of my definition of sucess it
was like to become rich so but like I I
don't think it I think that's a small
part of definition of success to be hon
like I need to do quite like I already
started doing like but I need yeah I
need to like with like social skills a
bit better and
stuff and
explore and improve like I've been doing
a couple things like in in that that s
like like recently like like I'm not
very good social but like I started
going like improv classes once a week
just to like participate with some
people like U yeah just to learn to so
not socialize but like like I have a
safe place to socialize a little bit so
once a you you just go show up
and and and now after like eight years I
moved back to lato so now so so and and
in lato like before I was in living for
like eight years I would come back like
one one month a year I would spend here
but I wasn't making new friends
so yeah maybe go to go to like yeah if
to answer your question yeah like just I
think there's so many like fig to become
successful but so I think fin natural
did quite
well and I know poker poker sense I can
compete
but yeah I I need to dial in a bit
better like some other things and like
improve social skills maybe some public
speaking or like stuff like that and uh
and yeah and and and maybe post post po
care you don't go to extremes because to
high extrem because I think in poker you
kind it's very isolating and you're just
like kind of like oh this is one good
thing but it's like it was still very
exciting for me but this was it's kind
of repetitive it's only like it's only
like strengthening your one part of the
face but it doesn't streng doesn't give
you too much another parts of of a
lifestyle I
guess the reason I like to ask that
question is often success and
achievements are very closely linked for
a lot of people but people like yourself
who had of high amount of achievements
often think of it differently they
realize achievements one part of success
but it's not the whole picture and like
actually relationships matter actually
Health matters actually other areas of
life also matter alongsid it and it's a
a moving equation that's why I asked how
it's changed over the years because some
parts of your life you prioritize
certain goals you achieve those and get
success in them then other things come
onto the to the surface like you
mentioned more social time more
interactions back to your home country
to build more social bonds more
connections I currently live in barley
right now been here for 10 years so uh I
feel that I I've missed a little bit of
that deep social bonds with my close
peer grips so I I know like myself
that's kind of a little bit missing from
my vision success as well so he just
trying to figure out for yourself during
these years what aligns with your
current vision and how you make steps
towards that so that's why I like to ask
that all right looking back on your
career what are you most proud
of I mean I'm proud about my about my
results and uh
I'm not sure
it's I don't know if I and also like I
think I did good with like coaches I
feel Tre coaches well and stuff and
people I was like like walking with in a
close
proximity but
uh yeah I don't know I I don't want to S
depressing but it's like it's poker you
know and I don't know I did a lot of
like poker career and
uh I was good at I think I was pretty
good at my job but it's uh like to be
proud I guess I'm proud of being good at
my job but it's like but I don't know
the job description itself is it's it's
if if you're going out in the poker say
oh I'm I'm I'm poker
player yeah maybe we say oh I'm very
good like a chess because if it's like
like like a if you Compu as a
competitive game oh it's good because SP
player but also just po player you just
you're a smart guy you just in whis
profession but
your profession is just gambling I guess
it's like so but I'm proud to be good at
my job that's I'm proud of it about
that I
guess yeah great answer and yeah I think
that's the thing right you've done
really well with what you've decided to
dedicate your time and energy into it's
funny with poker isn't it because from
some people looking from the outside
looking in they think it's more gambling
orientated and like there's not much to
it other people get really fascinated by
how the Strategic level how deep it goes
and how smart you must be to climb to
the top of the poker ladder um when
you're in it it kind of feels normal for
you just like it's just a game I'm good
at it and that's that but there's
actually a lot that's gone into into
your craft so for proud you also
mentioned results and if anyone seen
them you've got like some of the sickest
graphs on all your sites like multiple
Millions on ACR party poker poker stars
how much do graphs matter at this stage
because I know a lot of players they
almost like fixate bit too much in my
opinion on having a pretty graph on
having a nice win rate having a good
good amount of money obviously alongside
that but at the end of it once you've
got climbed the hill you've got those
how much are the graphs to you
personally matter at this
stage it's still not not a nice thing to
show you know it's still a nice thing
to it's also like it's just almost like
evidence of being good get at your job
but I just wanted I just posted it just
to get get myself a clap on a bag and
just whatever feel good about myself
house but but uh
it it doesn't really matter much I don't
know but
it's it's uh it's a I I feel I just just
wanted to slide her back just to get get
myself p on her back and that's it
but to be honest I wanted to ask you
guys a question like recently I was
making a call with some po po friends
and we were just uh because I I knew I
was going to talk with you so I wanted
to just practice a couple hours of
talking so I called and one of one of
the guys was stay in B actually and one
another place and we play people a lot
and he watch like one hour one hour
footage of me playing and and and and we
got talk a few hands and we say like we
play 510 and 20 and we say oh I think I
would play like 90 95% of your hands
almost the same and this is like one
hour and doesn't feel like different I
say and I think I I think yeah yeah I
think I think you will it I think I
think that SCH said is not so much
different so not so much different but
maybe just just performance perform
anxiety like because it was like 100 200
games or like four tables or something
and this goty place prob like 1020 510
or
something
and so I think the skill set itself like
for 90 95% of the actions is
like it's almost like similar but like
maybe like like 5% or 10% of astion and
and and and anxiety of stay maybe that
makes the difference or
something yeah so so my take on that
would be uh the details of those five
10% probably matter more significantly
than we equate to and I think it's often
like say you look at all the big pots
playing the session in like the coolers
like yeah that's kind of standards and
there's a lot those little small BB pots
that kind of people brush over but then
the best players play those really well
and over time those can add up add up
add up to a to a large win rate so yeah
I feel like yes obviously there's a
breakdown in performance when a a player
goes from a lower stake to a mult really
high stake if anyone tries to play the
stakes you play without sweating and
having some anxiety there's um it's
probably unlikely so there's element of
performance drop off at the stake but I
do feel like the the details like the
level of thinking that you're doing in
these spots and the ones you're picking
up that you do deviate and the reasons
you choose to deviate I think they' be
great edge of no so that would be my
tick on it Renee what's your thoughts on
that yeah I feel like at high stakes it
is the five and 10% that's play
different that's actually what's going
to make the difference right because
especially now you know people the
mistakes are getting less and less an
average mid six player is already way
better than it was 5 years ago so it is
the difference between that 5 10% also I
would say the biggest difference and
it's only getting a bigger difference is
just their ability to perform Under
Pressure like you already said are you
able to show up and think rationally
don't get caught up by emotions due to
high stakes due to tough oppositions
like basically your ability to perform
your game because I'm sure and this has
maybe also been your experience with the
guy you worked with right in terms of
that that you got coaching from there's
some guys that play mid Stakes for
example that if you would talk poker
strategy which you're like oh wow wh why
why did you play high scks right but
then like you said performance anxiety
comes up there's all these other things
that prevents them from performing you
know may maybe when they sit and perform
and they make a couple mistakes they
lose their [ __ ] they start to play bad
they start to get emotional they start
to get tilted there's so much things
that that go on in terms of there's such
a big difference between being being
able to talk strategy or being able to
to coach for example and being able to
perform well at a high level at high
stakes right it's a really different
skill set in my opinion and to touch
actually a little bit on the graphs as
well I feel like for catch game players
gra we we don't have trophies right we
don't get a trophy like tournament
Players they get trophies or baselet or
stuff like that catch players just have
a pretty graph man that that's our
trophy right so you know we also want to
get a trophies you know and but like
tournament Players they they have like
trophy trophy things right why why can't
we just hang up our graphs everywhere
right as as like you know every year
you're just listing your that that's
your trophy like yeah also even if
people like pretend we don't want we
don't want any compliments if they
pretend to still Everyone likes to be
compliment Everyone likes to be
appreciated Al so it's just universal
truth doesn't matter your low St High St
so yeah like Everyone likes to like just
likeit little bit compliment so that's
the reason I posted right is yeah just
get some you
got every human has the need for for
recognition validation right some more
than others obviously uh there's always
outliers in the story but yeah for me
like if someone would just list in his
graph every year and hang them all the
wall for me it's the same as like a
tournament player showing off his
trophies I mean tournament Players that
they they should they have like a trophy
Locker right why can't we just hang up
our graphs that that's how I see it
personally yeah let start new trend cash
game players every year I want to see
graphs on the walls in a frame yeah yeah
but yeah yeah I understand completely
it's like the the validation recognition
for the hard work you're putting in it's
like you don't need validation for
everything but you're working hard
towards this it's meaningful to you
you're good at it and maybe 30 people in
your environment know you're really good
but most people don't you're like hey
I'm pretty good at this like here's my
result to just a little bit of p in the
back in prayers recognition for for the
h work you're doing I think very very
normal all right what do you think is
the hardest thing about being a poker
player it's not easy do what you do it's
not easy the lifestyle the grinds what
do you think is the hottest thing about
being a
poke it's just like I think it's like
very ative thing you know just
especially online poker players
like you do mostly by your by
computer everyone is just a male and it
would be nice to have like 50% of
females that would be nicer because you
don't have to go you maybe have find
some de inside Pok ball instead of going
C Pok ball that we fine
because I think like if you're a doctor
that's like 50% of doctors are like
girls now if you're a lawyer where like
you can find the lawyers but you're not
going to find another pocket players so
that that that's a fun thing that would
be a fun thing
but yeah play just maybe isolation espe
online is you just like you you stay
online so many hours by yourself and
uh and real skills that doesn't
like where you going to use like real
skills like you eight hours online and
he's just grindy poker and but it may
notate so much to to the real world to
be honest other things
so so I think that's the toughest
challenge with poker World guess like if
you want to be online poker professional
poker player but yeah yeah I think it's
it's an isolated male dominant Pursuit
especially the online grinds and there's
not much glamour in it obviously you
play the highest Stakes which from the
outside looks glamorous but it is you
and your computer long long hours de the
deer often no one else around unless
you've got a little bit of your grind
with so how have you dealt with
loneliness over your career how have you
kind of managed that trying to connect
with people because you did mention
relationships and finding the right
people to be around has being important
to you have have you balanced that with
the the lonely isolated online grind
that that you have to do I when when I
did travel like I had a like friend
friend group you're going now for drinks
you go like you do some sports together
go to the beach
together so about was funny yeah it's
like okay you 68 hours to play poker but
you're like couple hours to socialize
and I'm I'm also like the type of guy
but I cannot socialize all day long
every day like I need like three days by
myself and like a couple days like with
people so like I'm also like maybe if I
like socialize more and improve like I
can socialize increase the percentage of
how much I socialize with people
but but even even even if I don't play
poker I'm still sure I'm I'm sure I I
still GNA be some days I'm just by
myself because I get that around people
I think so like so I need a couple like
one day by myself and I can go out and
do some things again with people
so but yeah it it will depend for every
person for personality I guess m how I
do it but other people have different
type of how much they social social
interaction we need and stuff and
uh yes some people are more social they
just get gra gratification by around
people and some people like need more
isolation I guess or like I get even if
you enjoy being around people and fun
time but still like after a day or two
you get exhausted from socializing you
to like go lock yourself up for a day or
two I think yeah it's F what works for
you right that kind of sweet spot it was
interesting when I got into Pok myself I
was quite exted quite social and then I
went into online grinding and playing
10hour days and I think I would have
went crazy like from a personal
perspective but I had two my close
friends in the same grind house as me so
I live with to my best friends and we
talk a strategy so I had that social
connection alongside the grind everyone
else outside of that little bubble I it
barely spoke to for years apart from
like the other little thing here and
there um so yeah I think it's like
trying to find out kind of what what
works for you if you are obviously more
social person you need to find that kind
of Sweet Spot maybe you will play less
online volume or you'll be in a grinding
house or something like that to uh to
get those connections or if you make to
many sacrifices like say you are someone
who likes to be around people and you
isolate yourself for year after year
online grinding at some point you will
most likely hit a Tipp in point where
you feel like the trade-offs too big for
yourself you got to find that kind of
that rebalance yeah that's for you
you've you know when you need to connect
with people you're good by yourself a
lot of time grinding and then just
trying to see friends when you can and
obviously traveled a lot the last eight
years or the last 10 years to with
friends which have been yeah social
environments as well all right what is
being what's the nicest thing about
being a poke player we've touched on the
hard stuff what's the fun stuff about
being a poke
player not having any boss but that's
nice
and being able to to to to live from
like more from any place you want you
can as long as you you have internet
connection and I guess technically if a
country allows you to play from it
so like maybe if if America was allowed
maybe I would go like if I play play
forl B for America maybe I go go some
more time in United States but it's
still very nice to be able to travel to
a lot of countries and just live from
there and uh work your own hours you no
one tells you what to do you just you do
you do your own thing and
uh maybe maybe meet some friends yeah
make some couple friends in poker world
and
uh make some money I guess if if if you
if you're doing good at it yeah but
I would I would say that's that's the
nicest things that I would see in the
poker
world you got the freedom to choose your
own adventure hopefully profit on the
way and that's the fun thing about poker
I think also as you mentioned for this
conversation poker allows you to realize
that the effort you put in can get the
get rewards from it I think often life
that's not always true if you work hard
at something like poker it dis reward
you maybe not one for one maybe not
directly maybe not on a yearly basis
even but over time if you apply yourself
well poker will struggle to make you run
bad enough to not reward you so I think
that's a a good thing as well on on the
pursuit of that so I want to my last
question for you there's a midday player
watching this or listening to this
conversation and they're inspired by
your story and they're playing 100 andl
maybe 200 andl pay a law and they're
ambitious like you they've got like
hunger you head as a 19y old and they
want to make it to your level and the
patent they want to do it what be some
advice and words you would give to that
person you can almost relate this to a
younger version of you uh on the come up
how would you any advice you would give
to that
player if you really enjoy
it you have to really enjoy
it if if you're 19 and you're force
it unless you have no success and and
you and you still like the game and you
want to find a way to have success so
you you can figure out how to figure out
your struggle so you can start enjoying
it and then to enjoy it and keep for you
keep your occupation for many years I
think you should do it
but if if you kind if your enjoyment
levels are not there to like just oh
okay I I wake up I I I I exercise and I
I and I go just I go to work and I be
quite a professional
and I will study I
will I will pay attention on my tables I
to try to keep up with it and and at the
end of the day if you still have the
winning session but you was oh I'm in
different I don't know if I'm play but
if if you still everything is going well
and and you not enjoy maybe it's not for
you but if everything is going well and
you enjoy it it's probably it might be a
very good profession for you so I would
say if if you enjoy it yeah keep it up
and find way find ways to improve at fer
and uh don't be ignorant don't be
ignorant with st with shots you take or
like what kind of games you play or like
don't even if you if if you make it's
okay to make a mistake but uh don't
double down on it you know if if you
make a mistake don't just keep repeating
or exaggerate from a mistake you you
make mistake you I need to like oh I
lost here I need to Chase or I need to
like double down or something or I lost
to this guy are gonna go in on a casino
something know you took short you think
must s you lost you take a set up back
to where you're winning and keep moving
trying to make the best decisions from
your from your current situation
great advice there's a lot of a lot of
wisdom back in that it was the enjoyment
first and then they get better and enjoy
getting better and get out your own way
don't be ignorant learn from mistakes
and yeah strap in strap in for the ride
because it's going to be a a long but
hopefully hopefully fun ride so yeah
great advice Rena for you what do you
think is the nicest thing what what has
been the nicest thing for you about
being a poker
player it's funny to tap into to to to
the enjoyment that he just mentioned
because then like obiously if enjoy
something and if you're motivated to it
then obviously uh it becomes easier so
then the question is how can we make
something enjoyable and I feel like when
you really try to dedicate yourself try
to set a big goal and really become
curious how you reach that goal like for
me poker's been most enjoyable and we've
heard this I think throughout many
conversation and grasby again pointed
this out right when he was ready he was
trying to take over the world or if I
think about my career at the moment
where we were trying to take over the
world like me and my group that that's
when poker's most enjoyable so we got
like we got a big goal we got a nice
challenge outad of ourselves we have
that competitive dve we're curious we're
interested in like okay we're here now
and we're trying to get here and we're
we're very much in the moment right
we're really trying to uh trying to
figure this out and I guess our skill
level like obviously we're in like that
flow state right it's not too hard but
it's also not too easy so if you keep on
riding like that flow State up that's
when poker is is most enjoyable and then
yeah to to answer your question what's
what's the nice thing about being a
poker player that basically you have you
have everything under your own control
right often we're we're talking about
variants and stuff like that but if you
really think about it like like grass
also said we have no boss we have no
let's say in a in in a soccer team you
have a coach that might not or not like
you or not like you or not play you or
does play you in a said there's so many
outside circumstances I feel like as a
poker player we have way more control
than actually in the outside world right
where you have bses who have to like you
or want to promote you or you know like
we've we've many times touched on the
variance that's in the Olympics or the
World Cup and stuff like that these only
come around once every four years to as
a poker player we could just show up
every day on our mission improve and
it's that process where you really
dedicate yourself to it when you have a
hard puzzle that you have to crack and
you can just show up every day and try
to crack it that's that's what poker's
most enjoyable yeah if you if a poker
enjoy it if if if it over all like nine
of of 10 days nine of eight out of 10
days n of 10 days you played in last
days you enjoyed it's probably
profession for you but if yeah so just
buck it up buckle up for a long ride yes
there's not going to be a fast
ride you might go up in stage and might
get kicked back a little bit down
and but see and and like see also see
these obstacles in the way uh see these
as like opportunity right to learn if
you can start to reframe those and like
oh cool I get an obstacle that I can
learn from and it's very easy to say now
I'm sure there's some people listening
you know that struggle to pay their
bills that that need to have like their
monthly income from poker there's a lot
of stress involved it's very hard to
enjoy poker if you're in that situation
so when we touch on what's the hard
thing about being a poker player like we
obviously there are some survivorship
buyers here and there are some buyers in
terms of that all the guys that we have
on were successful poker players but the
majority people are struggling right so
what's hard to thing about being a poker
player I think to get to that point
where you know your your income in poker
is not directly anymore related to the
bills that you have to pay because it's
very hard to enjoy poker when there's
Financial stress it's very hard to be
curious towards the game it's very hard
to not be result oriented when you have
to pay the bills this month so the
hardest thing is to get out of that and
to to put yourself in a position where
you can actually enjoy the
game 100% true yeah if you get get if
you can get to a point where
maybe your income is like twice your
your bills and you can build up and you
see oh you're building your bankroll
every year even even get small down
thing can build it up and next year you
have more more of a bank Ro to and and
maybe more of a skill to take shots of
diff and higher States
and maybe next year your ta has only
like 13 or one5 of your income that
becomes like very pleasant like very
pleasant like how to say adventure to to
go with from like from pretty safe
environment financially you're still
going to have your swings and they still
gambling
but at least the most money you make you
can keep it on PO and and and you don't
have the living experiences with like
biting into your like po po Adventure I
guess to make it repping up this
conversation gra V what would you like
the main takeaway to be from this
conversation we had
today I wasn't sure how going to appear
on a camera and stuff but you know like
like as as I mentioned before like like
like when I was 20 21 I was so impressed
by by watching like ben6 podcast source
and stuff maybe I'm not on the same
level like popularity or even like I
think maybe even better but
but maybe there's going to still be some
people going to be impressed by what
they have to say and maybe maybe can at
least I can impress some young people
are trying to move up in stakes and we
can see what this life lifestyle is
about
and and give them better perspective how
it goes I guess or like or or what what
are adventures and what what's the the
and the point of view of one one one one
guy that made it but maybe there's some
other guys that make it and may have
different perspective
and uh yeah just want to maybe leave
like uh like some some some feedback for
guys that moving up and they can see how
to do it or
something oh it's been very motivating
if I if I talk for myself I feel like
you shared a lot of uh a lot of
interesting perspectives uh obviously
there's always a trend and some overlap
between your guests but I definitely F
you brought some lot of unique points
that I think a lot of our audience will
will benefit a lot from
so thank you a
lot thank you guys for having me it it
was a pleasure you guys a great great
host like I got recommended from a
couple people they say oh these guys are
great they make your life easy if you
want to come up Podcast which is like
this is a place to come so yeah thank
you for inviting me and I'm very happy
to come here to chitchat about some
things and like maybe get have some
story to tell and uh and Inspire younger
generation or at least if not inspired
give him some feedback how it looks like
the poker from one of angles in the
PO thank you Graz viz for sharing all
this wisdom with us throughout your
story Adam any main takeaways from this
conversation yeah I really enjoyed the
conversation I thought we covered a lot
of really high level topics the thing
that was coming through a lot for me
throughout the conversation was his
obsession for the game but also about
getting better about learning improving
his constant drive and curiosity around
that to keep improving and it sounds
like for him which might be different to
other players he didn't really have big
goals going in I think you asked him
like did you want to be like antoniio
did you want to be like a big high St
player and he's like nope just wanted to
beat the game in front of me I never
thought two levels above just that next
level and that obsession with being in
the moment doing what you're doing but
trying to get better at your craft I
think is yeah the kind of one of the
keys to his success that kind of yeah
non-stop curiosity and try to get better
alongside that Curiosity he had he has a
very good Focus attention span and I
really liked how he was keeping the Mind
engaged around his Focus he was asking
himself I think it was like five to 10
questions for one spot what's this guy
got how's why range interacting with his
all these deep level questions to ensure
that his attention is where it needs to
be that was coming from a drive to comp
compete and beat his opponents but also
he's curious he wants to know how can I
maximize my EV here which links in with
his two main things he likes to compete
and to make money and for him he's found
a sweet spot between the two where he
can play at a very high level his dream
game is one whe for the best players in
the world that might not be everyone's
dream lineup for him that's great
because he can stimulate his mind with
competition but also make money doing
that and that's his kind of sweet spot
so he's found his own kind of path there
and you talk a lot about kind of find
your own Journey what works for you he's
very kind of mindful to talk about his
journey because this is what works for
me don't necess say it's going to work
for you and for him he's found that real
sweet spot of what engages him next
thing I tou on was self being
self-critical I was interested in what
he said about that he mentioned that you
can push it too far and you can be spend
too much energy on things that don't
matter I speak to a lot of people
mindset wise who over critique they
spend too much time on the small details
their mind is too perfectionist and they
almost like zooming in at every single
small Nuance where he he was talking
about scanning for mistakes always scan
to make mistakes but not overemphasizing
any not overreacting go yeah a mistake
happens no big deal and then one of the
funny parts I found of the conversation
was
in the kind of questionaire we talked
about we P the conversation he mentioned
no no Rock B moments smooth ride no down
swings so I all right I'll I'll ease off
the down swing conversation then he just
casually says oh yeah I lost two to
three million in this one session and I
lost 25% my bank roll and he has brushed
all like there was nothing and I think
his quote was I think I thought it was a
plus a spot and I lost no big deal so I
think that mindset of not reacting to uh
things not going your way doesn't matter
if it's 2 million or 2,00 ,000 it's the
same game of just take plus big spots if
you lose what can you do about it get on
with it and I think that mindset is hard
to relative for a lot of people but yeah
very powerful so I was really impressed
with how quickly he was able to for some
more controls next day he's back to
grinding in in his mind he said I'm back
in those games next year when I've
rebuilt my bank roll and I've got enough
exposable income to play those super
high games so yeah I liked everything he
was talking about mindset wise I really
related to it I also like how deep you
went into for talk about lifestyle and
sleep been is such a good performance h
a diet exercise how looking after your
body holistically is what helps his
performance so yeah really glad that
that came out in the conversation which
hopefully will inspire some listeners to
uh to make some changes as well how
about yourself R what was the main
takeway for
you I remember a little Goosebump moment
when you guys talked about and I like
the phrase like take over the world I
was like oo and I like I could get a
picture how that would look right it was
him and his friends traveling sitting
down and think okay how are we going to
take over the world right how are we
going to [ __ ] you know beat everyone
up uh that was like a little gooseb
moment and how they we going to do it
preparation that was something that
really stood out to me the amount of
preparation and the management he said I
don't like I don't like down swing and
he said then there's some sort of fear
of mistakes and this type of mix made
him manage his shots very nicely right
he said when I take a shot I make sure
it's a good game maybe I'll come in
short stacking to reduce the variance
and he talked in general about many
other things outside just the technical
game to make sure that he set himself up
for Success curiosity you already
touched on was a very big one I was very
surprised like he's probably arguably
one of the best six maxpow players in
the world and he still has a coach right
he said thr out as a career always the
two coaches something that you would not
expect right you would expect a mid six
guy to have a coach and to be fair most
mid six guys don't have a coach so
that's that's pretty pretty interesting
uh also in terms of efficiency was also
something that wrote down and that kind
of ties nicely to the coaching right
that he kind of outsourced his studying
and outsourced his coaching uh which I
thought was yeah a very smart thing to
do and it really sound like something
that uh uh that works a lot for him when
he did work with solvers in the general
right he had a curiosity to understand
the structure of Poker he hired the PO
guy who was specialized in Game Theory
he read the medic Medics of Poker and
when there was were solvers he would
looked at it in a universal way right he
tried to understand how is poker
actually played then when that fundament
was there then from there you know he
could figure out oh I have a mix let me
see how my opponent plays should I go
right should I go left and I feel like
if you only play exploitative you start
to mix and go left and right with all
types of hands that go so far against
Theory uh uh that you could actually
screw up quite bigly if you read is
wrong right which is actually also
something that touch on kind of the risk
reward from an exploit is this is this
exploit worth making because if you just
think about oh the guy deviates I make
an exploit that's not the whole story
right because if he's onto your
deviation and he counters then how much
do you lose you kind of call it as let's
say you gain three points for your
exploit but if he counters you lose
eight risk reward might be off so I
thought that was a very interesting way
of thinking about it as well and in
general just yeah very out of the box
thinking in a lot of these uh these
areas So yeah thank you thank you very
much man for sharing sharing all the
wisdom I thought it was a great a great
