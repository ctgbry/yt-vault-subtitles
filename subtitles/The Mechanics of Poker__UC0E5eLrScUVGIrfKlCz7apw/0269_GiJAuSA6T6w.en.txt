What was your goal this year?
Consolidate myself as a hike six crash
game player.
&gt;&gt; Oh man, I'm like [music] freehanded with
Kevin and Davey and Lionus. Like I was
not like feeling scary. I was like
motivated. [music] I'm finally here.
Like I dreamed about that my whole life
and I just focused on performing. It's
completely different, man. Like the guys
are protected in every node. They will
have the right frequency, [music] the
right hand glasses. So you really cannot
mess up and try to go for Oh.
The new king of cash games is here.
Today we will be chatting with freshly
crowned cash game world champ, the
Brazilian high stakes cash game player
Pedro Birusin Doedo. In this episode, we
learn about Pedro's journey. 5 years
ago, I was playing 1 cent to cent like I
was doing and 5 years ago. I had no clue
about poker, any clue about theory,
about GTO. I didn't know what any of
that was. approach to strategy and
mindset being way too station. I'm still
am but not as I used to be. Playing on a
few that people were not that aggressive
on GG. So I was calling everyone and
nobody was bluffing. So that's a a big
reason like it's really hard to make
money when you are calling everyone and
nobody's bluffing
&gt;&gt; and walk through the insane final day
that made him the champion.
&gt;&gt; I think it was even worse than a final
table. like it's a final table that went
for two days, you know, and you have to
like you have to to sit out and watch
the guy play and just hope like somebody
is not going to to pay them off or make
or hope they make mistakes. [music] Hope
they go on a down swing. Surprised me
like seeing like a lot of guys tilting
on the chat talking trash like a lot and
I didn't expect that.
&gt;&gt; Did you get involved?
&gt;&gt; No, but they involved me. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; [music]

Without further ado, guys, enjoy this
episode. the champ. Pedro, thank you for
coming on the podcast, man. [snorts]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, thanks for the for the for the
invite. I've been watching like episodes
my whole career, inspiring all people
that came here. So, it's an honor to be
here.
&gt;&gt; So, this is actually the real high point
of your career, not winning the Cash
Game World Championship.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, for sure, man.
&gt;&gt; Well, first of all, uh obviously huge
congratulations for winning the 2025
version of the Cash Game World
Championship. It's obviously insane by
itself. Uh but even without this
achievement, it seemed like 2025 uh
really was like your breakthrough year.
Uh absolutely crushing the 2KL games on
GG, which are currently the highest
stakes and toughest games I think they
offer. Uh we will dive into your whole
journey in this podcast, but I want to
start this conversation towards let's
say the end of last year during maybe
the first cash game world championship.
Where in your career were you at during
this time? And did you follow the action
back then? And did it motivate you to
one day participate? Or maybe you even
considered joining already one year ago
or do you think you weren't ready yet?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was falling for sure, but I like
one year ago I was like so far away from
playing the stakes that I was not
planning on on like playing that on a
near future. Uh, I think last year I was
grinding NL200 ACR and I was doing like
the kind of supernova elite problem that
they have there and I just got banned in
the middle of the challenge. Like I was
like 80% completed. I have like almost
two million hands almost completing the
challenge and I got banned and I lost
all the progress. So I didn't got any
money and I had like to
reschedule everything that I have to do
in my year. Like I lost all my progress,
all my grumped
back to playing GG and start to playing
500 1k 1k and taking shots at uh at high
stakes by the end of the year. So yeah,
I was following for sure, but I was not
having plans on playing this. As I say,
I was like so far away from playing 10k.
Like I was just hoping on the 1k hands
and so yeah,
&gt;&gt; but it definitely was something uh that
you were intrigued by. You liked it kind
of the the setup, the competition.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, for sure. For sure. How can
you not like it? you know, like all the
guys that you have been following to
your career, like all the the goats and
the the end bosses playing against each
other, like I think for anyone that
likes cash game is like
the best format you can have watching
all the the legends playing together.
&gt;&gt; So, basically, uh, fast forward one year
now, you actually won the thing. So, how
has your game evolved over the year? And
how have you maybe evolved as a player
in the course of 2025 that made you feel
like this time you were actually ready
to battle and possibly take it down?
Yeah, as I say like in the beginning of
the last year, I was playing I have
already played like 1K and 500 before,
but I was so tired of GG that I I tried
to do this this challenge by playing
like I think I need to play only ACR
like close to two and a half million
hands to get their supernova elite and
get like close to 200k in rake back. So
I I last year decided to do that. got
banned at the ACR by a unreasonable like
like
they they accused me of soft playing
guys from Brazil which was insane like I
was just like punting everywhere against
the guys and like there was no reason at
all for for the band. So I really got
scammed scammed by ACR.
&gt;&gt; You were getting too close to actually
reaching the Supernova elite program.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
And so I I I've decided to when when I
got banned for NCR, I have to
do other things like I I didn't have
like the the challenge to do anymore. I
couldn't get the supernova elite. So I
went to back to GG, started playing 500
again, 1k again, and I just started
crushing all the limits. I crushed the
500 1K and I started to play 5K in the
same year like from July to to December.
I play 500 1K started taking shots at
5K. I was doing really well at 5K and
then the games got uh like closed the 5K
5K 5K games got closed at GG.
So they they start with the 2K games and
I start to play 2K, started doing really
well at the 2K games and then uh this
year I kept doing the same thing playing
the highest games that I that I have uh
available and I was doing really well at
all the games that I I was playing. So
this year I had like already playing I
had already played 10kl at other sites
but really small sample 5k too but
really small sample. So by the end of
the by the end of the year when the the
challenge the challenge began I was like
having the best year of my career by a
lot. Like the last year had already been
the the best year of my career, but this
year had been like four times better
than the last year. So I have like I was
already have like a great year. So I
decided to take a shot, you know, like I
set like seven by shots for the
challenge and and that's it. Things ran
really well. I run pretty good. Uh it is
what it is. You said that even prior to
you know winning the Kashkan world
championship it was already your best
year so far. What do you think was the
main contributor for that? Do you recall
like any big evolutions you made in your
game or as a player over the course of
2025 that you know put you in the
position that you were ready to take
this shot against the end bosses?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's pretty clear what I like.
I've been an MDA g guy for
the most of my career like I joined
metag game I was five years ago I was
playing one cent to cent like I was
doing five years ago so I was I had no
clue any clue about poker any clue about
uh the about GTO I didn't know what any
of that was so I start to I I joined
Metagame and I was I start to playing
like MDA strategy is the first thing
that you you learn when you join metag
game is like how media works like a
simplified strategy and so I spent like
two or three years playing only MDA uh
going up the stakes but just by playing
MDA and then when I got like to 200 L
something like that I start to study
more GTO and learn the GTO concepts and
all these things. So I I always had like
a strategy of mixes of both like playing
GTO but always knowing that the pool
tendencies and all of these things and
when I was playing the challenge I I was
playing like 200k hands a month. So I
tried a lot of strategies like I tried
to play like one month I was playing
like only GTO. Another month I tried to
play only like MDA and was seeing what
works better because I I I had to play
so many hands that I I think was cool
like to try a lot of strategies and see
what was going to do best. And one of my
classes with Salo
uh he told me like Melie you are so an
intuitive intuitive guy you always talk
about your intuition and everything you
say about about your intuition is like
always right but you don't follow it you
try to follow the GTO you try to follow
MDA and you don't go with your intuition
and you should try to to follow your
intuition more and when he told me that
I I spent like 200 100k trying to follow
my 200k hands, grinding 200 and LL
trying to follow my intuition and I I
just crushed it. Crush it and since then
I just became like I can say like an
intuitive player like I go with with my
intuition a lot like I
I don't I don't care about deviating
from MDA or deviating from the if I have
the how you can say like the feeling of
the thing. So I think that was something
that changed a lot like I started to
believe believing and trusting my
intuition and by the time I started
doing that I just start to crushing
every game that I played.
So then uh if we look at the online
poker for example as a video game right
you you explained you started at 2L and
you you know you go to the next level
the next level the next level then I
kind of see like the Cash Cam World
Championship I guess you can kind of
compare it to like Bowser's Castle you
know in in Super Mario you know you
reached the end level now it's up
against Bowser in the castle. What were
like kind of your motiv motivations to
uh uh to take part in the challenge?
&gt;&gt; Just playing against the best like I I I
want to know like how how well I would
do if it was if it's going to be like
that hard if it was impossible. Like I
want to test myself like I was I am
pretty aware that a lot of guys there
are way better than me. Like I don't
think like and the guys the time that I
have in poker these guys have the double
just playing high stakes. So I didn't
expect to go there and crush everyone
because the guys have way more time of
poker than me. They can be way sharper
than me like but I just want to test
myself and see how I would go I was
going to to perform there. So it was
just like a personal challenge for me.
Did you like plan it ahead of time when
you heard of it or was it more like oh
[ __ ] it's going to start next week you
know [ __ ] it seven buy shot let's go
&gt;&gt; yeah exactly like that like I didn't I
was wasn't plann
I actually start like a week later on
the challenge because we have like the
meeting of the the the team I was
traveling with my family I was just
playing my my normal my normal ground
grind on GG and other sites
And I was having like a a good month
already. I was like 80K up or 70K up.
And then somebody told me like, "Oh, the
challenge is going." And I and I I
thought, "Oh, man. I'm doing already
well this this month, so I'm going to
take a shot." And I did.
&gt;&gt; So it comes back to your intuition,
right? It's just intuitive. Hey, I feel
like it now. And my intuition said this
is a good this is a good time. You
obviously said, you know, you're you're
not ignorant of the fact that they have
way more experience at high sex than
you, but there was still you you have
enough confidence in your game to be
like, oh, you know, let let's give it a
try. What do you think is like your main
strength uh coming in? Like obviously
you were the underdog kind of you said,
right, in terms of experience, but I'm
sure you have certain qualities that
gives you the confidence that you at
least think that you have a shot, right?
If you're if you think that you have
stand no chance, you wouldn't
participate. So, what do you think gives
you that confidence uh uh yeah to take
that leap of faith in your game and jump
in?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know that I'm not going to be as
sharp as a lot of guys are, but there
are a lot of other players that are are
are that are aren't [laughter]
I don't say I don't know how to say
that. There's other players that aren't
good as they are. like they're kind of
at my level, but
uh I think I I could perform really
well. Like I'm really hard to to tilt.
Like I can play long sessions and play
my a game for long hours and
uh not try to level with anyone or get
tilted with anyone. And I also believe
in my game. I maybe not as sharp as some
of the best guys, but
there are other other competitors too.
So, I think it was a fair game. I really
like that. It shows kind of the
perspective. There's this great quote
that I like is what you focus on is what
you feel. And basically, if you look at
everyone who participates, well, if you
focus on the guys that are worse than
you, you feel pretty good about your
game and you hop in. Whereas, if you're
like, "Oh, [ __ ] I'm going to be have
I'm going to be up against Kevin Owen
Lionus. You know what? Maybe maybe I
don't feel that confident anymore, but
you said I mean, you know, you you
should take a look. There's also guys
that you know that are don't want to say
spots, but for the challenge, they are
kind of the spots. Like, did you have
like certain lineups in mind or that
that you were maybe looking to avoid to
give you uh
&gt;&gt; No, I was actually playing I was
actually playing on one like I played
threehanded with Dave and Kevin. I was
not like table selection or anything
like that.
And that was just purely you you did you
feel like for example I think there's
again two two sides of this like someone
can sit down and kind of feel
intimidated or there's like the flip
side you love it so much oh wow cool I'm
up against Dave Kevin which side you
fall on
&gt;&gt; exactly like oh man I'm like threehanded
with Dave Kevin and Davey and Lionus
like I was not like feeling scary I was
like motivated like I'm finally here
like I dream about that my whole life
and I'm I'm here. I'm just and I just
focus on performing, trying to not make
big mistakes and just following my my
game and
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; it's very common that I hear
[clears throat] throughout all the
podcast that we did that when people
move up or play tough for opponents that
they kind of fa to bring their own game,
right? They think they have to do
something special or they give their
opponents much credits. Were you able to
just play your regular game or did you
notice uh some something like that going
on as well when you played against like
the top guys?
&gt;&gt; No, no, I just try to follow my own
game. I know that if I try to deviate,
I'm going to lose a V. I'm going to make
more mistakes. So, I just try to play
like uh the game that I play against
good regulars that I face. So I try to
be like more balanced and I try to go
for huge exploits and trying to like
don't deviate a lot and try to be more
more precise
like obviously you have experience at
high stakes but was this the first time
that you played with guys like Dave Jess
Owen Kevin Lionus etc. And if so, how
was it to how is it different playing
these guys than playing your your
regular opponents?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I've played like most of the
guys I have never played for. I never
played Dave. I never played Lionus. I
play I play Owen and Kevin, but just a
little bit. I think we're just messing
around at 2KG and I play some hands
against them, but not a big sample at
all. But mo most of the guys I've never
played before and it's completely
different man. Like the guys are
protected in every node like they will
have like the right frequency, the right
hand glasses. So you really cannot mess
up and try to go for oh this guy's
capped here. They are not. So you just
can't go for the same exploits that you
use at your normal stakes. And yeah,
basically it like you you have to be way
more aware that they won't be capped.
They will have like the the combos that
they have to protect their range and
they will put you in way tougher spots
than the normal competition. Yep.
Did they throw you off at any point?
Like especially in the beginning, was
there anything you didn't expect where
you're like, "Oh [ __ ] Well, this
definitely another level. I have to I
have to I have to sharpen up my uh my
skills here." Or was it pretty in line
with what you expected?
Yeah, definitely. Uh
they they they put you in tougher spots
all the time. So, but I was I was
expecting that, you know, I'm playing
against the good guys. I I expected them
to do that like and it's not that I was
like oh I didn't expect these guys to do
that. They are the guys that you expect
to do this you know
&gt;&gt; and you love it right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah for sure. For sure. I was so
hyped to playing this. I was so happy
playing this. Uh so I on the first days
I was just like playing one one table
two tableling and trying to mix it with
my own grind. And then I start to to to
run good and to to play well and start
to to be up a little bind. So I I quit
all my my normal grind and just start to
grind the challenge and like it was like
the moment that I have more fun in my
whole career. I think like was so fun
playing that. I enjoyed a lot every
minute of it.
&gt;&gt; I want to kind of walk a bit through
like the timeline. I was looking back at
your result and it seemed like you said
you had a seven buy in shot. Never
really needed it. It seemed like like
the first 10 days were, you know, kind
of testing out the water, not kind of
break even.
Yeah, exactly. Uh I was not putting too
much volume on the beginning, but I
never really needed to use like the
seven binds. like I I I got into some
kind of big down swings, but I was
already up in the challenge, so it was
all good. I didn't have was close to to
have to to quit.
&gt;&gt; Was there anything that surprised you
about uh how the games played?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, surprised me like seeing like a
lot of guys tilting on the chat. I
didn't expect like all the stop guys to
to be ted and I saw that a lot like guys
uh talking trash trash talk on the on
the on the chat like a lot and I didn't
expect that.
&gt;&gt; Did you get involved?
&gt;&gt; No, but they involved me [laughter]
there. There was no hiding.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Uh I'm curious what did uh
what did like a typical day during the
challenge look like for you?
Any like any routines or habits that you
relied on uh to make sure that
&gt;&gt; the same routine the same routine that I
have waking up early like 6:00 a.m.
making a a morning grind stop have lunch
go to the gym do some exercise come back
grind the game. So I just followed the
the same routine that I always have. I
was not trying to to change anything. As
I say, like I just
just from the to the end of the
challenge, I I I have like the okay,
maybe I can win this and then I have to
change some some things like I was
grinding a little bit more like trying
to fight for the the top the top three
uh positions. So yeah, but most of the
challenge I was just following my normal
routine and doing the same thing that I
always do.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I was looking at your at your
graph and it seemed like around day 12
to 14 you picked up some heat. I think
you went on like a 10 by an upswing.
Fortunately, that was short lift because
I saw two days later you basically were
back break even again. That was like
halfway through the challenge. any like
reflecting you did at that point or was
it just like ah just a matter of
continuing and you know I feel like I'm
playing well.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, as I say like I think that's a
strong like thing in my game like I
don't get like uh I don't care about
losing buys and getting to down swings.
I just know it's part of the game. I
don't tilt. I just keep playing my best
and I don't let this
things that come from variance to to
affect my game. In every top sport, data
is used to find bigger edges and poker
is no different. Alongside using solvers
to build a strong theoretical
foundation, I started studying
population tendencies back in 2016 to
get a more accurate picture on how
people actually played. I went from
trying to mindread my opponents to
clearly seeing where the exploits were
and which decisions were actually plus
EV. Once my decisions were rooted in
data, I stopped second-guessing my
bluffs, calls, and folds and became far
less affected by short-term results as I
now knew exactly what the ranges really
looked like. Just like solvers have
evolved from setting up your own piosims
to effortlessly browsing any solution
you want in GTO Wizard, data has gone
through the same evolution. What used to
require massive databases, powerful
computers, and hours of manual work is
now fully accessible instantly in your
browser. Thanks to Snap NDA. With Snap
NDA, studying how humans really play has
now become more powerful and accessible
than ever before. You get access to over
450 million hands played across all
major sites, removing any sample size
issues or guesswork. Snap MDA
automatically compares human tendencies
to GTO play and instantly shows you the
EV of your plays. Alongside river
bluffing frequencies, it shows flop and
turn range compositions not distorted by
showdown bias, allowing you to clearly
see where ranges are too strong and too
weak, so you can avoid and strike
accordingly. You can filter for any
specific player profile from aggressive
to passive rags and from small fish to
big whales and start to see that what
looks random in isolation actually
follows clear predictable patterns once
you zoom out. In short, Snap MDA shows
you exactly what the ranges really look
like from pre flop all the way to the
river. And once you know the ranges, the
correct strategy becomes much clearer.
You can even analyze the strategies of
top performers or this group of bots
that have been consistently crushing the
games. So, if you're tired of
uncertainty and overrelying on blockers
to make decisions, Snap MDA can help.
Start with a 7-day free trial and get
15% off your description using code
mechanics link down below. But without
further ado, let's continue with today's
episode. Do you ever doubt in like uh
start doubting your game when you're
going to downswing? Like especially I
can imagine in obviously in your regular
grind where you have established
yourself and you have millions hands of
data you know to back up that that
you're a winning player and obviously
your identity is very in line with I'm
you know I'm ped I crushed the 2K and
now games on GG but you don't really
have the same sample in in a format like
this right so I can imagine if you would
go on a little downswing that doubt
could creep in that was the any at any
time the case for you or you think it
was kind of the same as always.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think so. Like I was for
sure making mistakes, but I was also
spotting people making mistakes. So I
knew what's fair game. Like
I'm making mistakes. These guys are
making mistakes, too. Let's play and
let's see how it goes. Like 10 by 10
down 10 binds down swing is like pretty
common. Like it's normal. You face that
all day. So yeah,
&gt;&gt; I like I I like again the to highlight
the perspective again like yeah sure I
make mistakes and if you just focused on
your own mistakes you know you might
feel better about your game be like hey
but there I I've seen them make plenty
of mistakes so it makes you feel good
about your game again. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Um
&gt;&gt; everybody's making mistakes, right?
Nobody's perfect. Like of course the top
guys are making less mistakes but
everybody's making mistakes all
&gt;&gt; I like to usually say that poker is a
game of mistakes. You have to make less
than your opponent and then you will
win, right? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Uh it seemed like uh day 18 seemed to be
the turnaround point for you. You booked
your biggest winning day of the
championship and setting the run upwards
in motion. Tell us what happened.
Anything particular or was it just you
know the card started falling your way?
&gt;&gt; To be true like I don't remember the
days. I don't remember like oh this day
I lost that much. I this day I I I won
that much. I was just playing every day
and not caring about results that much.
So, I really don't remember what day 18
was
&gt;&gt; until someone uh Hey, hey, hey, Pedro,
you're you're leading. Did did you know
that? Like, oh no, I I did it.
&gt;&gt; Oh, for Yeah. Yeah, for sure. I was
checking the leaderboard. I was seeing
this, but I don't remember when was the
turning point. I don't remember the day
or how many buys I won or how I felt. I
was just like playing every day, waking
up, checking the leaderboard, and
grinding again and just going, you know.
Well, I'm sure there was one day that
you do remember the day that you took
the lead.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I think
I was really close to take the lead. Uh
it was me, Davey, and Kevin, but Kevin
was away. I think he was in Japan and he
was not playing for a while. So, what
like me and Dave like really close to
take the lead. So, I remember when I
take the lead because I I messaged
everyone. Oh, yeah. Take we took the
lead. We took the lead. But he was all
right so far away from from from the end
of the challenge that I didn't get that
hyped you know I know that everything
could happen so I Yeah. So then uh when
indeed I think it was one of the last of
the challenge like a day before it ended
out of nowhere I think you were kind of
I think we we spoke a little bit on
Discord right like you said Kevin was
traveling and you were in the lead so
there was not really an incentive for
you to play right I think Dave was quite
far behind so it was kind of a situation
where if Kevin doesn't play you don't
play
&gt;&gt; yeah yeah exactly
&gt;&gt; the same that happened with me and
project like when we were getting to the
end of the challenge Because the the
challenge is made this way like you
don't have any incentive to to play when
you are in the lead because you can go
just you can just go on on a down swing
and and give like the first place for
free for the second place. So you just
sit there and and wait for the guy to to
catch up. So I started doing that like
by the end of the challenge when Kevin
was already uh out out but he came back.
So I just was waiting to see like how
how Dave would perform. Like Project was
not even close. He was way down there
and just booked like 24 buys in a day
and then he he became a threat. But I
was just like checking up the
leaderboard, see how the guys were doing
on the on the day and be ready ready to
grind if somebody catch up.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because I I I can imagine your
eyes were mainly on Kevin and then you
heard, okay, he's traveling. I think it
was to Japan off snowboarding or
something and you were like, well,
that's uh stay there, you know, that I
can just remain sitting out. Davey, you
know, obviously was there and then like
you said, out of nowhere, I think it
literally a day before the end suddenly
prodded you with a 24 buying upswing.
Now he's saying
&gt;&gt; you did say like you know obviously
uh uh it like you can expect it but a 20
I I think no one saw the comeback of
Owen coming right that's obviously such
an insane swing but you did say like
okay I wasn't getting too comfortable at
the leap because I know anything can
happen. Were you still surprised that
this happened?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, for sure. like I didn't
expect like uh Owen to to came from
like to have like an upswing like that.
I don't remember the last time that I
won like 24 buys in 24 hours. But he's
saying congrats to to him. Such a beast
like giving trouble all of all of the
the last days and putting the grind.
Insane, man. What what he did was
insane.
&gt;&gt; Well, getting to know you over the last
25 minutes, I think you liked it. You're
like, "Ah, we're back on." Or was there
was there a po or was there another side
where you're like [ __ ] not you know I
was in the lead why did this happen?
&gt;&gt; Yeah both like my competitive side was
okay things are getting interesting but
I also really want to win like I really
want to book the win so I was like oh
man this [ __ ] is coming close
and he he's he's going to fight for that
for sure. So yeah kind of the on both on
the both sides.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean I mean if if if if there
was a movie production team behind it,
we would have believed it because it
kind of came down to the last day,
right? I think it was as close to what
you could get to like playing a final
table, right, in a in a cash game
format. It was you, if I'm not mistaken,
&gt;&gt; I think it was even worse than a final
table. like it's a final table that went
for two days, you know, and you have to
like [laughter]
you have to to sit out and watch the guy
play and just hope like somebody is not
going to to pay them off or make or hope
then make mistakes. Hope they go on a
down swing.
&gt;&gt; What was more stressful watching or
playing?
&gt;&gt; Watching for sure. Like I told that to
everyone when I was playing like okay
project is first now I just sit there
put some music I was playing and
singing. And I was just really chill,
just trying to catch up, like doing what
I always do, like playing poker, like,
okay, I'm I'm not I'm not nervous at
all. But when I take the lead again and
I go out from the computer and was just
watching, it was [ __ ] I was so
anxious, like so intense, and just
watching without being able to do
anything. It was, oh man, it was insane.
Insane.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, especially if then Owen and Kevin
start to clash in the pot. Uh I I recall
a big pot putt that Owen was playing
that he was a bit tilted off. I heard in
in hindsight that if he would have taken
a different line, but that's also what
Kevin said in the end. Yeah. Well, you
know, I could have taken a different
line on day three, you know, and it
would have make a difference as well. Of
course. Uh I think there was a So the
last day it was prod was in the lead, so
you were still chasing. There was a big
hand I think that kind of that twisted
around for you. We played a four bet
pot.
&gt;&gt; Was it four bet? Yeah. in in general.
Actually, I maybe first want to ask like
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the queens that that was like the
breakthrough hand, right? That that that
allowed you to sit up. But maybe before
we dive into that hand,
&gt;&gt; like the dynamic of the last day, were
there any like strategic adjustments you
were making? There's sort of like some
ICM in play because like you get better
odds, right? Because if you can sit out
that's obviously worth something and you
get 50k on top extra. How did that kind
of alter your strategic approach? like
when you are like like in second place
and the first place like two BBs ahead
you you have to play tighter and just
wait for kind of kind of how is ICM
plays like you can't just be punting and
just like uh taking like play wide and
aggressively. You should tighten up and
play more more tight overall
at least is what I think. So, I'm not an
MT expert, but I I feel like that was
like the the the correct way to play.
You're just trying to to get QBS and get
the lead again. So, yeah, you're just
trying to focus on on doing that. And
when the gap is bigger, I I think I
heard Kevin, he came on the stream right
after then that he said uh about that he
was considering calling Owen down with
ace king high or something because he
said, "Yeah, you know, I only have to be
right what 15% of the time because if I
win this pot, I could be in the lead and
I can go sit out and there's 50k extra
on top." So
&gt;&gt; there's like it's almost like there's an
extra big ante in that pot that you
could take in consideration. So your
odds are suddenly getting better.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So maybe talk us a little bit about that
last hand. I'm sure that's a hand you
remember
&gt;&gt; the queens.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And I was actually drawing
that in the hand and just hit runner
runner quads and it was like the last
hand that I play and after this hand I
told like man I going to win this [ __ ]
like impossible. I'm making runner
runner quads.
This is mine. Like oh he's not going to
catch up. But he always did that again
like but uh gave me confidence you know
like oh man this is meant to be you know
uh but yeah it also it was me and Owen
were just like oh 2B ahead the other guy
came he's one BB ahead and this hand I I
I took like a lead of 3k is not
anything on playing 10k but it's better
than 2Bs right so it gave me like a a
time to breathe, to to go out, smoke a
cigarette, and try to relax a bit.
&gt;&gt; Try to relax a bit. I mean, it seems
like I I looked at your Instagram. There
was uh you've invited quite the party in
your house, huh? You had like a lot of
support around you. Everyone was
drinking, you know. There was like some
pagi playing, you know, for the people
who don't know, like some Brazilian some
Brazilian music in the background. It
seemed like a pretty relaxed vibe.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they were relaxed. I was not
relaxed at all. [laughter]
Yeah,
&gt;&gt; it must be very difficult as well
because you're kind of there trying to
relax but in the same time you know that
literally a minute from now you could
have to go back to your computer sit
down f and refocus.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like we had like a notebook in the
pool like and we were like the guys were
there like I has Zen Hoko like the guys
from from Metagame. They came here like
to to see the the final day and they
brought they they brought to him a guy
with a camera to to record the the last
days and record like the celebration and
the they make like a documentary. I kind
of say that. So they were they were
tense too but they were for sure I think
more relaxed than than I was. So I
always when I I was not in first I would
go with there with them like try to to
to talk a bit and relax like to smoke a
cigarette and and talk with the guys. It
was good like it was better than sitting
alone in my computer and looking at the
screen you know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Then you just sit there alone with
your thoughts. You have no one to talk
to. I mean obviously then you know
people you would go to your like own
online community right you would be
chatting there but I can imagine like
&gt;&gt; the vibe from what I saw especially then
when you win that you were not just
there sitting alone behind computer but
it was more like an actual live final
table where you had all your friends and
like I saw in your Instagram it was just
a big party.
&gt;&gt; I'm sure I'm sure you guys had a good
night
&gt;&gt; for sure man. Yeah. Yeah. I celebrate a
lot like we drink to to the the sunrise
and it was really good. My my family
came, my father, my my mom, my friends,
the guys from the team. So, it was a big
party.
&gt;&gt; Still recovering. Uh
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; looking back at the at the event, any
anything that stood out to you? Any main
takeaways? How do you feel about it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, man. It was just insane. like the
I think was the best experience I had
with poker like in my my whole career. I
never had like a big final table or a
bigger hit or any title or something
like that. So I was just planning on
taking shots and playing against the
best guys. I didn't imagine that I would
book a win. So yeah, insane run, insane
insane ms insane insane challenge. So
yeah, everything was insane about that.
&gt;&gt; How much in your opinion? Like there was
I don't know if you followed any of the
streams but every time different people
came on and always the same questions
arise like oh sample size variance what
does it matter how much do you think the
results of this challenge indicate who
is currently the best six max cash game
player and kind of so kind kind of
asking are you now indeed the code the
goat of cash games
&gt;&gt; of course not man yeah everybody that is
a professional understand that that low
sample variance plays a a huge hole So
you can't just say like I'm this guy is
the best because in 40k hands he was the
best. It's just insane like we would
have to play like for years against each
other to to see who is the best and even
playing years var would still play a
hole you know. So yeah. Are there like
some uh some other guys that come to
mind that gave you a very hard time or
that you would still rank higher than
yourself despite you being the crown
being the being crowned as the champ?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, man. Proj is so good, man. Pro is
so good like he gave like a lot of
trouble. He played really well and also
Kevin Chu David and Jason Ko all of the
guys man they are all tough to play
against you know like there's no easy
competition there but a lot of respect
for all the guys they all all be
business
&gt;&gt; you're looking to continue uh seeking
them out and and battling
&gt;&gt; I don't know man uh I I I can't actually
battle with them because I I don't have
my I can't play at the ACR and that's
where most of the games run. So, I'm
kind of capped to play at TG and at
coin, but the games at Coin Poker don't
don't run as often as I want. So, yeah,
I don't know,
Adam. I can imagine uh that if you come
from such a high as Pedro is now, it's
very hard to kind of switch your brain
again and sit down and go back to your
regular grind. any uh any any advice
maybe that you have for Pedra as a
mental game performance coach in terms
of how to go from here,
&gt;&gt; how to make that switch?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I thought the same, but me and
Pedro spoke before we came on and he
said he was back grinding straight away.
So, that didn't really apply. And yeah,
I think it's like it's like when you
achieve a big goal, there's a massive
kind of dopamine release. There's a big
kind of release of adrenaline. You've
achieved something major. So you go out
to your normal life, there's going to be
a little bit of a not not feeling like
as as engaging, not feeling as driven.
Uh but yeah, I think the main thing is
like getting back on routines, getting
back into your normal rhythm, realizing
you're going to maybe be a bit flat for
a few days, you're not as driven as you
were. Maybe there's still excitement,
adrenaline in your body from the
challenge itself. And I think it's
giving yourself time a few days, a week,
whatever it takes for your body is to
reset yourself. Your nervous systems
took a absolute battering, being in a
high stressed cortisol state for a
while. So anything you can do for your
nervous system to let it recover. But
yeah, I think just listen to your body.
I think Pedro, as you mentioned, you're
very intuitive. Very good time to use
that intuition. Do it do what you feel
like doing in the short term. Uh prior
recovery as well. Yes. I'd love to
change the conversation a little bit
towards mindset and how you were able to
battle the best players in the world
consistently for days and days. You
mentioned some really interesting
things. One was that you were hard to
tilt and I find this fascinating. So for
you in terms of your performance, your
mindset, how much did mindset play a
role for you in terms of being able to
consistently play at a high standards
compared to some of the guys you were
playing against?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. When I say like hard to to like
it's not that I like Buddha playing like
or then I'm I'm Zen. I am really like
responsive like I I sh like not in the
chat but I I'm here like oh this
[ __ ] Oh, good. Oh, like so I
get angry, but I I don't transfer it to
my game. Like I don't start to playing
bad because I got angry with something.
So I'm really good at keeping the game
plan and don't change the way I play
despite how I'm feeling, you know? So, I
think it's like a a good thing from from
from my from my games. Like it's really
hard for me to to take a different line
or do something that I wouldn't do
because I I lost a pot or because I'm on
a down swing. I get angry for sure. I
get frustrated, but I don't apply that
to my game, you know.
&gt;&gt; How are you able to do that in a
practical way? Because a lot of people
relating to this will feel the same
emotions as you. But those emotions have
an intensity and often emotions can
drive action especially like heightened
emotions like anger. All of a sudden we
can start playing faster making
emotional decisions. It feels like
you've got some sort of override there
which will always use your kind of
baseline strategy and emotions rarely
take the wheel. So for you how do you
kind of stay in control whilst
experiencing heightened emotions?
&gt;&gt; Yeah I don't know actually how I do
that. I think it's kind of natural like
I think I I have always been like that.
I got better with time for sure because
I was facing like the the same pattern
again and again. So I have to to get
better at it. I also like work with CP
like a mental coach for years too. So he
he definitely helps with that. But
there's there's a really part that I
think it's like natural person to person
like I like some guys will will will
tilt and some will not like I don't
think there's anything special that I do
like oh I do that and I I I
have this method or I I meditate before
I grind. I think it's just the way I am.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, it sounds like you can stay
in control whilst in highly activated
states. So, you still feel like you can
make clear decisions. Uh, which maybe is
a natural thing, something you've
learned as you've grown up, but it's
definitely feels like a a very good
skill that allows you to perform really
well in this environment. When you
decided to do the challenge, what was it
that made you feel like you could come
out on top? I know you spoke with Rene a
little bit about this, but I'm curious
about like the mindset of stepping into
an environment where you're playing
against other really good regs. Did you
have to go into any like gears mentally?
Did you have to uh psych yourself into a
certain state? Did you feel any sort of
thought patterns that were channeled
towards this specific challenge?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was just talking to myself like
every day all the time like you are
going to win this, we going to win this.
Like I was I I already seen myself as a
winner before it happened. Like
everybody that I talked I was like I I
already won that. I already won that. I
won. I won. I won. like and I think like
this helps to give you confidence and
and and and
make you more comfortable and just
seeing you as the the champion before it
happens like uh and talk that to
everyone like oh we already won like
it's is already mine. So uh you see like
a lot of
great performers that at least they they
do that like even even if we're not the
best they just believe that you are it's
going to help a lot.
Is this something you've done often
throughout your career? Kind of project
the future kind of almost like manifest
like this is going to happen for
yourself and how much comes from like a
strong belief like do you actually
really believe this is going to happen
or you trying to kind of create an
environment where you feel positive
about it? I'm curious to know that.
Yeah, sometimes I I actually even don't
believe but I I keep repeating that
myself and and make me believe that like
sometimes I'm like on a really down
swing, really big down swing and your
your subconscious like oh man we are
going to lose again today we're going to
lose but I always try to to to stay
positive like no no it's going to be
like the turning point here we are going
to crush we are better than these guys
is is just like variance so let's go
let's go like I try to to to keep myself
positive
It's not possible at all the times like
poker is so rough with that like there
are so many things that we don't control
but yeah that's like the the the process
the thought process that I I try to have
always like try to be positive and try
to to see me as the best player and as a
winner.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it's really working on
trying to instill a belief in yourself
and some that belief is really strong
and it's come from a real safe place.
Other times you're trying to almost like
project it out there to kind of feel
that energy of what it would feel like.
I picture Muhammad Ali saying he's
always say I'm the greatest. I'm the
greatest. And then in an interview later
on his career he said I used to keep
saying it but I didn't believe it at
first. I said it before I believed it
was true. And it's one of those things
where you're trying to like build a
narrative for yourself that you can kind
of feel into. You're trying to back it
up with action and you're trying to uh
kind of create this bubble around
yourself where you feel invincible. So
yeah, I'm feeling that kind of energy
from you where you were going in there
go right I'm going to come out on top
and you're kind of putting that energy
in there to kind of strengthen that
belief. Did you have to uh strengthen
that throughout the challenge? Was there
any points when you sort of place some
of the better players where you're like
wait a second maybe like uh I'm a little
bit at my depth or did you always have a
a pretty strong belief in yourself
throughout?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm kind of like I don't try to
think a lot like oh I'm facing this guy
or I'm playing against Linus or I'm
playing against Proy or I'm playing
against Davey. I just try to focus on my
game. I try to not make much mistakes. I
sit there with confidence and battle and
I I I try to not overthink, you know. I
don't think it's it's good to to be
thinking all I am playing this guy. I
have to do things different. I just keep
with my my game plan and I try to not
think a lot.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think this leads into intuition
as you were speaking about earlier and
trusting yourself. So for you like how
do you how are you able to do that when
things are kind of challenging? I think
intuition is one of those things where
when you feel confident, you feel in
control of variables, you can like lean
into trusting yourself. It feels like
for you based on that conversation with
SO when he was kind of saying um that it
was a strength of yours, you've really
went all in on trusting yourself in
these moments. So yeah, I'm curious to
know for you if you could maybe relate
to us what it feels like to trust your
intuition because it's one of those
things that we could talk about a lot
and sometimes we kind of miss what it
means for you personally. So when you
say trust your intuition, how does that
feel different from like just going with
a read?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I think like maybe you have like
you know that that hand is like a pure
bluff, but you get to the river and like
your subconscious are telling you like
don't bluff that [ __ ] the guy always
going to call you here, you know, and
just just trust like that inside voice
that is telling like in the subconscious
telling you what to do or or you have
like a read like you think oh I think
this guy is playing this way against me
like go with that you know go with that
that thought that is talking with you
like oh oh man this guy is not bluffing
you or you shouldn't bluff here like I
really take that in consideration you
know I really uh Uh sometimes like even
I struggle like I know it's a pure cop
but my intuition is telling fold and I I
I'm like there oh my god like I stud
this thing before is telling me to to to
pure call this is like a profitable call
and and then sometimes like I go against
my intuition and I'm wrong my intuition
was right again. So yeah. Yeah, I try to
actually like I don't go like full
blindly on intuition like I'm always
studying like trying to get better at
GTO. But I think as GTO makes your
intuition get better too because you
have like better understanding of the
game, better understand how how the the
range will will will
do in in certain times of birds. So
yeah, I think it all goes together like
experience playing a lot of hands. I was
I have always been a grinder. Like I
always played a lot. I've I think about
poker
every day all day since the beginning of
my career. Like I'm really addicted to
it. I'm really obsessed. So I'm always
studying poker, playing poker, talking
about poker. So this play like a big
role on your mission. Like it's I think
your mission is nothing more than your
subconscious, right? is all the
experiences you had, the things that you
studied like the the the
things you have gone through. So I
really try to to take that in
consideration.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly that. I feel like it's the
kind of combination of all your
experiences, all your knowledge, all the
kind of millions of data points that are
running below the surface that you might
not be able to cognitively talk about or
logically process, but it's all that
kind of computing power. So like when
you get a read this guy's bluffing here
or this is a clear folds it comes from
that kind of big data pool. So yourself
you me you mentioned like almost you've
got this intuitive voice that's telling
you to do one thing then maybe a theory
voice or a kind of strategic voice
saying one thing. Is this like quite
distinct for you? Can you kind of spot
the difference between like oh that's my
intuition lead me that way because it
feels like for you there's a bit of
separation there which I think many
people [clears throat] might not be able
to relate to that.
Uh do everything like if if I can spot
like the difference between like knowing
the GTO and knowing the intuition.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. How do you know coming from an
intuitive feel like not a bias? How do
you know like oh that's my intuition
that's speaking here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. Because like I have like
the clear like GTO vision for for for
example like on the spot like I remember
the scene. I remember seeing like this
is a pir but I don't want to call that
you know like oh man the guy's always
always gonna have here it's hard for him
to find the bluffs like uh I didn't see
this guy bluffing at all like he's a
need so you know like everything like
knowing the GTO is like you remember
like as you remember like something like
kind of material as I don't know if I
can express myself this way but you
remember seeing the thing like and
intuition is not like that is intu like
more a feeling, you know, you you don't
have like a a image of like the scene
and then a chart telling you to recall
that. It's just like a feeling that you
have during the the hand. Uh it's hard
to to to explain, but yeah.
&gt;&gt; No, Pepe science. It's kind of the the
challenge of intuition is it's not
really a logical framework. It's coming
from a it's a field-based kind of
decision points. So, when we try to put
weight on it, we kind of fall into
logic, which is not what intuition is.
So, it's an interesting conversation. So
for you, like do you feel like you trust
your intuition like 90% of the time in
those moments when you've got a kind of
decision to make? Do you lean heavily
towards intuition or how do you kind of
h decide what to go with in that moment?
&gt;&gt; I like I try to like just use like on on
rivers on tough decisions like if I know
a spot is like this is like a pure pure
call like or is a pure bluff and I will
not follow my intuition. But if I'm like
having to take the time and trying to
think about a lot a lot about of the
hand, if I'm not sure what's happening
interior, if I'm not really sure what's
going on, then I take like my intuition
like if if it's not a clear answer, you
know, if I don't have a clear answer, I
would take my intuition really in
consideration. I always I always do but
if it's a a a normal spot that you play
many times and you know this is super
plus I'm not I will not like don't do
that because of my intuition is just
like on the how can you say like micro
decisions or micro like you are not
really sure about you so could be this
could be that or like you are not like
100% sure then I I think I I took my my
intuition like a lot in consideration
Yeah, I think in those moments as you
mentioned like in river spots there's
often like a few subtleties that will
kind of sway the decision one way or the
other and you might not be aware of them
cognitively but your intuition is kind
of fine tuned to them picking up those
little small details. So it feels like
for you that's when your intuition
really comes into its kind of front
forte where you will you'll trust it
strongly. Yeah.
spot like I didn't have like I studed
like a multi-way spot or like a a note
that never happens you know like I'm not
using like on a my intuition on a bad
check bat on a single spot you know so
it's just like on the toughest parts
like you don't have a clear vision on
GTO you don't have stud that too much so
then I take like my intuition or or the
guys like shoving 5x on the the on the
favor going all in and you you really
don't know what to do. Like there I take
my my intuition in consideration but not
on the the average spot. No,
&gt;&gt; we asked in the question there what sets
you apart from other players and you
said I'm completely obsessed with the
game. How would you define your
obsession? What does that look like?
It's kind of an addiction. Like I I want
to play poker all the time. Like I I was
planning like on took a break after the
challenge and I was playing a day before
a day after the challenge. I was already
playing and now we're back to my grind.
So I really love playing poker. I love
playing poker like uh I I discovered the
thing that I I like to do in my life,
you know. I I never had that. I never
dreamed about being like a doctor or a
lawyer. I never really know what I want
to do in my life. And when I discovered
poker and it clicks, you know, that's
it. I want to be a poker player. I love
doing that. And I've been doing that
since since then. Like I I play all the
time. I talk about poker all the time
and watching poker stuff, studying. So
I'm just living poker 247.
&gt;&gt; Was poker your first love or did you
fall in love with anything else the same
way you have with poker?
No, I I always have like other things
like like skating and bike. I I always
like like uh sports that give you
adrenaline. So, but when I discover
poker like I abandoned everything and I
just became a sick grinder and now I'm
back like to to do things that I like
besides poker. But I spend years without
doing anything but just poker like
poker, poker, poker, poker. And then as
now that I I reached the high stakes and
I tried to get back to do like the robs
that hobbies that I I used to like like
skating, uh, biking and but yeah, I gave
up on everything for some years and just
focus on poker.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd love to go through your early
years and your kind of journey to where
you are now. Kind of piece together for
the audience like how you got to where
you are. I think you mentioned you
started 2020, so you must have been
around 26 around that age. And I think
from the questionnaire you filled in,
you said you went broke many, many
times. So talk us through like those
early days like how you were kind of
supporting yourself going broke. Did
this not make you think you're on to the
wrong path here? And what were some of
those initial challenges you were
experiencing when you first got started?
&gt;&gt; I I I went to Ro because I I have no
idea. I have no proper bankroll
management. I didn't know what was a
a bank management. Like I I didn't know
anyone that was a professional poker
player. I just like a friend invited me
to a live game. He didn't even know like
that this could be a profession. You
know, we were just playing like for fun
and I got addict addicted to it and I
start to like buying curses, studying by
myself, but I didn't have any mentor,
anyone to follow. So I just like I would
put like uh $50 at poker stars and was
playing 10 and you know with five
buyings. Of course I was going broke. Uh
so I I didn't have like the the proper
methods to to be a professional. I was
just going with like completely random
like putting some money playing whatever
I want and losing everything and I was
doing that over and over again. So yeah,
it was like a lack of of understanding
of of the game.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; When did that change? When did you
realize this approach isn't working and
I need to uh change direction a bit?
&gt;&gt; I was uh at college at the time and then
the COVID hit and the classes were like
shut down. I I went back to live with my
my mom. So I had like 24 hours. I had
everything paid. I didn't have any
expenses. So, I saw that as the time to
focus on on my dream that was to become
a a poker player. Uh I I I gave it a
shot again but doing the same thing that
I have done before like and I went broke
again and I say man no this is not going
to work and this is going to be the last
time and I'm going to to apply for a
stable you know I going to see if
somebody catches up to me and teach me
and this is going to be the last time
that I try and then I applied to some MT
stables and then I I discovered Zenon
that had like BRPC at the time And I I
always like the cash games more than
MTS.
So I I saw Zing and he has like BRPC,
but they only accepted guys from 50 and
L and above and I couldn't beat 2 and L.
So I say, "Yeah, that's kind of out of
my league." But they had like a a a team
that they would took like two and
players and and teach them to at least
beat 50 and LL to go to to BRPC that is
metag game now. And they accepted me and
I became like completely upset and I
moved up the stakes like really really
fast and joined BRC and I'm here now.
&gt;&gt; That's right. So for you, like what were
some of the initial goals you had?
Obviously, you're loving the game,
you're obsessed with it. Were you just
trying to play higher and higher for the
pure enjoyment for it, or did you have
some sort of competitive drive to get a
certain stakes or any other goals
outside of that?
&gt;&gt; I always saw you like a like a video
game, you know, like there is the next
level. Why I'm going to stay at this
level? This doesn't make sense like for
me at all. Like, okay, I'm beating 100
L. Why I'm not going to play 200. Then I
beating 200. Why am I not gonna play
500? Like why I would stay on the same
level? So I just see like that's like
there are all these levels and I want to
go on all of them. Like I want to crush
everything and I going to try to to to
be the best player. This was like always
always my goal like going going up in
the stakes. Like I never had like oh I
want to play like you know want to make
5k a month and I'm good. I always wanted
to to to go to do the best you know.
I love that mindset. I feel like that is
where a lot of players start out, but
then I think as you get to certain
levels, the money starts to feel a bit
real. Like say you get a 50NL, 100 NL,
200 NL, all of a sudden you can change
your life circumstances. You went from
being like a bit of a broke kid like
hustling to make things work and now
you're like, "Oh, I've got actually real
money." And that's when a lot of players
can kind of pivot a little bit to get
more comfortable. So for you, was there
any moments where the money aspect
started to kick in? Like you were making
good money or was that just never a
motive for you? You always wanted to
play that kind of next level computer
game.
&gt;&gt; No, never. Like I I always want to take
like the shot at the next thing the
moment that I could, you know, if like I
was allowed like you No, you can take
the shot. I will take immediately.
Sometimes I will take the shot even if I
I couldn't. [laughter]
And so I I always want to play higher. I
want I always wanted to play with the
best. I was I I always want to like be
one of the best. This was always my
goal. I was never focused on money. I
was focused always focused on the
competition.
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Talk us through what it feels like to
shoot a new level. You've done it so
many times in the last three or four
years. When you go to that next level,
are you trying to prove yourself in
terms of I'm going in there to prove to
these guys I'm good enough. Do you feel
like your your strategy's already good
and you want to kind of get the results
to validate that or how are you
generally thinking about those kind of
early steps into a new player pool
against new players? Yeah, I I think
that's was like a big factor that I I
always move move it up move it up fast
and didn't have like a lot of troubles.
I I never changed my game because I I
see a lot of people doing that like they
move up the stakes and they try to play
different and they try to do that and do
this. I always stick with my game plan
like I always focus on my game. I I
never was like impressed, oh I'm going
to play against this 500 LL guys. I I
never have like this kind of mentality.
I always just joined the pool and was
think to myself, okay, let's crush and
that's it.
&gt;&gt; Listening to you speak, you can tell
you've got a very strong mindset. Uh
quite unique in terms of your ability to
handle variance, handle down swings,
just keep progressing without any
thoughts about money. How much has have
you had to work on your mental game? How
much has it been something you've had to
pay attention to to uh to build a
mindset that can deal with variance and
the the swings that you've had to to
base?
At first I was I I tilted a lot like I
used to like broke my keyboard
almost every day. Like I was on my old
house my door was all fed up all with
holes and was punching the wall and
punched the door and broken keyboards,
broken mouses. But I I started to work
with CP a mental coach and he obviously
helped helped a lot. But also being in
that spot over and over and over again,
you start, okay, I'm not going to broke
my my keyboard again, like it's not
going to work, like it's not going to
change anything. So being on the spot
over and over and again, you start to
getting way more mature. And I think
like you start to understand the nature
of the game, you start to understand the
variance. And I think it's just like
also a natural process of of the player
to start to to understand that. Uh yeah.
&gt;&gt; So for you, do you feel like you just
had to have the experience of losing
playing a certain sample to really
internalize what variance felt like and
then to accept it or is there also
things that you're working on in terms
of mindset wise to uh to reframe things
to to deal with things quicker?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. like always like trying to
focus on what on what you can can
control and all of the things like
trying to have like not the mindset on
on focus on the money just trying to to
to perform and trying to take the the
best decision you can and the these are
things that you you start to get used it
and you start to apply the the the more
you you get mature at the poker but the
at the beginning is hard because you
don't understand the things a lot you
think you are in control of a lot of
things that you aren't. So you start you
you tilt a lot. Also have like a good
bankroll helps a lot like when you are
moving up in stakes and you don't have
like a lot of money and you start to get
on down swings and you see your money
like going out and you you have to pay
the bills. This this also really
frustrating. So when you start to having
like a healthier and healthier bankroll,
you start to tilt lead because okay man,
I have years of my my expenses paid. I
don't have to to worry about the the the
results that I have today. So a lot of
things go in consideration like you just
getting more mature as a poker player in
all of the spec like having more money
having more aware of the things you can
control working with the your your
mental coach and yeah I like a a lot of
things like going go into that. What's
your record for most of keyboards broken
in a session?
&gt;&gt; I have played like I have broken like
two keyboards in the same day.
probably a few holes in the door.
&gt;&gt; I used to like buy $10 keyboards and I
was sometimes I used to like go to the
store and buy four of them. But that was
it was not a good strategy because I
knew that I have more on the side. So I
was broking more because I have more. So
I started to just buy one by one because
I have to go out and buy a new one. And
then I was thinking twice before broking
it because I knew that I would stop have
to stop play and go to go buy a new one.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It sounds like you were planning
to break some. You've got them as
breaking toys there.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. It was really good actually.
Like it's really good to do that.
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Good feeling.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Are you grinding hard studying solvers,
reviewing hands, but still not getting
those results that you know you're
capable of? You're putting in the time
and effort, but without clear direction,
that effort does not pay off. That is
why I created the Mechanics Leakbuster
program, which is the exact system I
used to make over seven figures playing
online poker and have since taught to
hundreds of students so they could do
the same. Through our league finder
stats and pop-ups, you will gain clarity
on your biggest leaks and tendencies,
insights on how your strategies have
been performing in game, and the impact
variance has had on your results. But
knowing your stats is only the
beginning. In the program, we dig deep
into the root causes behind your leaks
and tendencies and use a proven
sevenstep system to fix them for good
and gain the skills to improve and
continuously evolve. As a poker player,
you'll study more effectively, overcome
leaks and tendencies that felt
impossible to break, and rebuild trust
and confidence in your game, finally
seeing your hard work pay off as you
move up the stakes. So, if you're ready
to stop guessing and start improving
with clarity, break through the patterns
that have been holding you back, and
take your game to the next level, join
the Mechanics Leakbuster program using
the link down below. Yeah. So, it's
really interesting hearing you speak
like that because I think it's easy to
uh to think someone who doesn't tilt
that much, especially your current
level, that they're quite internally
quite calm, which you've talked about
you're not at all, but also that they
haven't had to deal with kind of real
burst of anger and frustration, but
you've you felt it all. You've dealt
with all of them. It sounds like for
you, you function very well with
emotion. You function well with
adrenaline. You function well with
heightened states. Has this been
something that you think from your
skateboarding background or motorbiking?
I think you said you did as well. Do do
you feel like you've trained your body
to deal well with kind of adrenaline to
be able to to keep your mind calm?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure man. For sure. Like when
you do like this kind of things that you
can get killed like you can die, you can
die if if you make a mistakes like when
you go and and play poker and the most
you can do is lose money. It doesn't
feel so so scary, you know, like the
best the worst thing that can happen is
like lose a few a few dollars, lose some
some dollars. So it definitely helps,
you know, like you don't get like so
anxious or so frustrated because you've
been through more
more more experience that put you in
more danger than playing cards online,
you know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's interesting. So I feel like a
lot of this when you you think about
building a strong mindset, a lot of it
comes from experience. like the nervous
system learns to uh deal with danger,
deal with the kind of release of
cortisol, adrenaline in the body and
feel like I can handle this and you kind
of can't cheat the system. You can't
kind of meditate your way to it. You
can't journal to it. You just got to go
for a number of experiences where you're
like ah when this happens I can be okay
with it. So yeah, for you you're doing
things quite extreme outside of poker
where you're like ah a card game loans
this is easy. I'm not going to die
today. Literally not going to die. Um so
it feels like an easy thing to do. So
yeah, I'm not sure if the the
recommendation is to do some extreme
sports for guys, but it's something to
think about. Get out of your comfort
zone, do things that maybe get that
adrenaline spike and train yourself to
be able to handle hiding adrenaline,
hiding feelings, and to train yourself
to be okay in that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So for you, like when you were starting
with the climb, when did you feel like
I've arrived? I say that loosely. I mean
for you in terms of I'm making good
progress here. I think I can keep going
to the top.
I actually I I always feel like I can do
more and I think like that's the reason
that I'm always progressing like I never
have like this okay now I'm doing it
well I'm always pushing myself and and
being hard on myself like you can do
better this is not enough let's keep
going like this results can be just very
like I I always have like this feeling I
never like okay you are doing so well
now you are so good like I I I don't
have like this kind of mindset. I always
trying to to push myself and and and be
hard with my my goals. And yeah,
even today like I I just won the
challenge and like I'm I'm always
thinking like, okay, you you run well,
you you did well, but that's that that
doesn't mean anything. Like just let's
just keep working, keep studying, keep
playing. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think it's a winner's mindset.
If you look at like kind of the great of
sports, getting to the top's one thing.
Staying there is another because the
mindset now is people are chasing you.
You got to prove yourself again. Prove
it wasn't a fluke. Longevity is probably
the the biggest indicator of how really
good you are over time. If you can stay
at the top for for multiple years, a
decade in some some instances. That
really shows to yourself and everyone
else that you're really one of the best.
But yeah, it was interesting as you
mentioned there because I think for you,
you've got two things going in tandem.
One is this belief in yourself that you
can do anything. You can learn. You can
get better. You can reach the top. but
then also maybe an insecurity that I'm
not quite good enough yet. I need to do
more. I think when you pair those things
together, it one drives you forward, but
it also stops you getting complacent.
Because I feel like one of the
challenges when you're having success is
you start to go feel good. I can relax.
Yeah, I'm doing well. But it feels like
for you this kind of maybe an insecurity
might not be the right word, but it's
some sort of internal drive where I can
do better. I can get more for you. Does
that feel like a u a heavy feeling or
does it feel like an automated feeling?
I was trying to get into like the root
how it feels for you to feel like I want
to be doing more. Does that come from
like a frustrated drive or is it more of
a an energizing growth drive?
&gt;&gt; I think like
I'm I'm so happy playing poker. I'm so
happy doing this like that I just can't
get comfortable like I I living the the
dream for me, you know? I wake up every
day and do the thing that I love the
most that is playing poker. So I think
it's like just motivating like okay man
you are you are living the life of your
dreams. you are doing what you love, why
not get better? Why not do better? So, I
think like is is in a positive way. You
know, sometimes is is is it's kind of
pressure too like you just want to relax
and do other things and your your head's
like, man, you should be grinding. You
should be like getting better. Sometimes
it's kind of overwhelming, but I like
it. Like I I love I love poker, so I
love this that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It feels like you've got this
constant almost inner drive to want to
get better, to improve, to see how far
you can push things. And the good thing
is you're enjoying in every moment. When
you've got that enjoyment and the the
love of the game, you're like doing
things that other people might have to
work really hard at and discipline
themselves and you're like waking up
smiling your face going, "This is
awesome. I get to grind."
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I'm guessing like you do have times like
maybe periods where motivation isn't as
strong. I know maybe maybe not recently
cuz it feels like you've had an amazing
12 months in particular. Have you had
any po points where maybe you haven't
had as much love for the game as a motiv
motivation? And if that has been true,
like anything you've changed during
those times or you just are you somebody
who grinds through?
I I still didn't have like this moment.
I see like a lot of people say that, but
in the five years of my career, I never
have that. If I have I'm on a down
swing, I'm motivated because I want to
get out of there. If if I am on a
upswing, I'm motivated because I want to
make more money. So, I never felt off of
motivation till now. But let's see how
it goes from there. But I I never had
that problem. Like I I'm always
motivated.
&gt;&gt; I've heard someone say that you're very
good at playing regs and you always have
throughout your career. What is it about
playing other good players that brings
something else out of you? Do you feel
like that's just the competition drive
or when you are playing the cash game
championships? What does that kind of
challenging lineup bring out of you
which maybe playing fish or soft
wouldn't bring out? I think like is is
the moment that I play the best. Then I
I'm more more focused, more present at
the game because for me that's the the
true competition, you know, like that's
like the hardest the competition can get
like and I I enjoy that. Like it's what
I like about poker is the competition.
Of course, making money is also great,
but what makes me love poker is the
competition and try to be better than
the guy and try to outplay the guy or
understand what he's doing and doing
accordly. So I always loved rag battling
like it's one of the things that I like
to do the most but I play GG now and
it's hard to play it's hard to do rag
battles when the rake are so high so I
it's something that I can do so but when
I have the the opportunities is
something that I really enjoyed because
of the competition.
&gt;&gt; Yeah it sounds like for you you thrive
on challenges and you thrive on playing
in tough lineups. So you mentioned for
you you're intuitive player you like to
trust your reads. I'm curious to know
like when you're not on top of your
game, how that how you need to alter
that because I picture when you're on
your A game feeling sharp, your reads,
your intuitive drives are kind of uh
really in sync and you can get a go with
them fully. Let's say you're not playing
your A game. Let's say you're playing
your C game. How does that look for you
personally when you're a bit off? Maybe
your reads are a bit off, your intuition
is strong. What does your C game look
like?
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
that's the beauty of playing cash games.
to know when I'm not playing in my game,
I just sit out and go do other things.
Like I I really try to do that. Like I
can play my game for really long time
like I think I'm good at that. I can
perform on on my best for long hours. So
when I'm not doing that, it's really
clear for me like okay now you are not
you are not doing well. So let's take a
break. Let's play tomorrow. Let's like
avoid playing on on on this kind of
state. But yeah, I I just try to avoid
if I'm not playing if I'm not feeling
well, if I'm not playing well, I I won't
play, you know.
&gt;&gt; Perfect. Yeah, you have the
self-awareness to spot that because
you're in your ear games too often. So
when you notice that's not true, you
don't force it. You kind of take those
breaks and you don't play through it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I'm curious to know your approach to
risk. It feels like from the outside
looking in, you're a bit of adrenaline
seeker. You maybe probably take on risks
that other people may not. You risk your
life in terms of extreme sports
occasionally. In terms of like risk for
poker, how do you think about like
moving up stakes, aggressive bankroll,
shot taken? How do you think you handle
risk and what's your kind of approach to
risk taking?
&gt;&gt; I think is there like
uh it has two sides on that, right? Like
it's good because you I I love taking
risks like my whole life. I I I like
taking risks, but in poker is like it's
good because you're going to be
aggressive. Like you are going to take
shots at higher stakes. You are going to
be fearless. You are going to play
against anyone. You are going to make
the bluff and make the call. I think
it's like a skill necessary for a poker
player, but you can also bury you. You
know, you can like be displaced with
bankroll management. You can play games
where you are not winning because you
want to take the risk. So I see that
with like two sides is good and is bad.
So I just try to to to be on the good
side that and try to work on on the bad
like try to not do the the bad parts of
taking risks in poker. So it's not
actually it's not always possible but
it's what I try to do.
&gt;&gt; How do you stay on the good side and
what are some of the things you had to
change or things you you have to
cautious yourself so you don't take on
too much risk?
&gt;&gt; [sighs]
&gt;&gt; I just try to be like self-aware like uh
everything that I do I will like try to
to take a break like or analyze and I
also talk with with with other people
like talk with with the with somebody
from this table or talk like with my
mentor coach or talk with my girl what
what you think about me doing that I try
to take like I I'm always going to take
the the the risk fine, you know. So, I
try to to talk with people that are more
more that play safer than me and and see
their their perspective.
I like that cuz I feel like when you've
got a certain personality type, it's
really hard to see a different
perspective. You often need other people
around you to kind of give you that
insight that maybe you don't have. You
mentioned you took a seven buying shot
take out the challenge and then you had
a break even spell I think around the
10day points as Rene not noted but you
didn't really know. Um, if you lost
seven buyins around, let's say day 10,
do you think you would have stopped or
would you uh have told yourself to keep
going?
&gt;&gt; No, I would have stopped. I would stop.
I think like uh
&gt;&gt; like it's such a hard it's such a hard
lineup. like I was playing like my
normal game is like 2k and I was playing
10k and l so it's not a really really
good good like like good like uh uh plan
to set a shot and on on 5x the stakes
that you play and and not follow with it
you know so I was really like focused on
okay it's going to be seven buys and
that's it you know so I you can get on
such a huge makeup and lose lo lose so
much like and to to get that back plate
to K&L is so so [ __ ] hard. So yeah,
one thing you've done very well
throughout your career I'm guessing is
talk about things in buyins. So you
mentioned there seven buyins but it was
actually 35 buyins if you're a normal
stake and for you it feels like you're
able to just like go for a strategy take
a shot take and not worry too much about
like the the financial repercussions.
Maybe you kind of have a strate strategy
with your bank roll as you did with the
challenge for you. How do you uh handle
the bigger swings? Cuz I think a lot of
players who might take that approach,
they would not be able to uh deal with
the fact that these are 10k buyins
instead of 2k buyins and they're
swinging left, right, and center. But
for you, you're like, "Ah, seven buyins.
Let's go." How do you not get too
attached to the the larger swings,
especially as a year ago, you're playing
NL 200, now you're playing NL10K and
swinging seven buyins here?
&gt;&gt; I think like you have to do that. If you
if you play poker, think about money,
you are just [ __ ] You know you you
can do that if you are especially if you
are like just always moving up mistakes
if you are think about money you are not
going to perform you are always going to
be money scared so it's I don't know how
I do that I just do it but it's I think
like if you don't do that you you can't
do that you know if you if you go to
play 10k thinking about money you're
screw no
&gt;&gt; yeah I think for you it comes down to
your overall motives you were never in
pocket for the So why start thinking
about money now where other people who
were trying to make money or get to a
certain checkpoint financially? It's
hard to switch that off. It's hard to
get to a certain level and go, "Oh, I'll
get to this amount and stop thinking
about it." So for you, it's never been
in your goals, your reference point.
You've always thought it as a game that
you want to level up the character and
money's just been a byproduct. Has there
been any time where you've kind of kind
of checked in with yourself and like
actually I've made quite a lot of money
in this game and anything changed or you
still feel quite the same just enjoying
the game and not really worried about
the the results side?
Yeah,
like it's actually really good make
money like this changing my life like
and from the people around me like I can
help other people's I can have a good
life me and and and my fiance like of
course money changed but it didn't
change like the passion for the game and
didn't change like how I approach the
game like I just won the challenge and I
was playing 2KL again yesterday
It was definitely not for making more
money. It's just because I love playing
and I was doing what I love. So yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Great mindset. So so good to uh
feel internalize that love of the game
and just no matter what stakes you're
playing, you feel happy, content in
those kind of pursuits. Rene, for you,
do you feel like you've been able to
have that same approach to shot taking
play for buyins? I know when I speak to
players like probably one of the hardest
mindset challenges of m of stakes is one
the ego side of playing type of
opponents but also getting past the kind
of new money swing the new biggest down
swing the new biggest swings and he
doesn't sound as prom
do you have any tr troubles with kind of
jumping up stakes
&gt;&gt; I mean I think it's very hard to be like
better exactly because I feel like he's
he's definitely you know on on on
champions league level there I' I think
I've got better at it but I feel like a
lot as a lot in my po career I kind of
got better at it just by learning or
finding, oh, I run into this. Okay. And
then trying to trying to get mindset
tricks to to kind of make me feel
better. But in the end, I do kind of
like what Pedro says, uh, if you kind of
read through the lines, in the end, you
know, you have to just do it, right?
There's there's no escaping the
uncomfort. It's just it's just part of
the game. So, he doesn't make a big deal
out of it. Yeah. Okay. Of course, it's
it's not as comfortable as your previous
steak, but obviously, what did you
expect, right? that it's the only way to
go through it is is to go sit down and
play, right? I feel like with everything
the better sense, yeah, you you you just
do it as part is everything is part of
it. Like he doesn't create stories
around it, which then creates emotions
around it. Um, so I I I would say I got
better at it, but definitely uh I've had
my fair fair share of struggles, but I
feel like nowadays as you also mature
like like obviously like like P also
said with experience with mature also as
your bankroll grows, you know, if you
don't play a ridiculous stake, usually
it doesn't really uh bother me as much
anymore. And it's it's the same with the
perspective like what what Pedro said as
well. if you go in a downswing like
actually I was talking to to to a
student of mine and he was talking about
down swings are stressful I was like
well that's a story that you created
that it's not true for everyone like you
could also look at down swings in a
different way I was like oh I never
really thought about it that way right
uh so it's kind of you kind of create
the narrative right you and the
narrative creates kind of the emotions
around it so for example if you're in a
downswing like Peter said it's very
motivated right to get out of it or if
you're in a downswing it's a great
opportunity to to lose lose less than
your opponent, right? If you zoom out,
if you make if you lose less than your
opponents in the downswing, in the end
you have a higher win rate, in the end,
you're a better player. So, there's all
this kind of mindset tricks things. And
I think for some, it comes natural, more
natural. But it seems like for Pedro,
because of the amount of volume that he
played and amount of experience. It's
like what he said. Well, I I noticed I
had a certain approach, it wasn't
working, right? Smashing my keyboard all
the time. At some point, I notice, okay,
if I do that every time this happens, I
have to keep on doing it. This is not
the way it works. So then you upgrade
your your perspective so to speak. Uh so
I feel like uh uh he builded this
mindset uh through experience and being
put in situations and be like oh my
current approach is working. What's a
better approach or what's a better
perspective? Um so yeah very very
impressive very well done. Um I want to
kind of take it to a bit more of a
technical focus. You mentioned uh that a
big change for you uh in your career is
when you joined a stable in this case a
metag game in the past BPRC. I remember
actually we had Zenya on the podcast. I
don't know if you if you've listened
that one you said that you listen to
some pots before. Hope it hope it was a
motivator for you. You moved up very
fast after you joined the program and
you talked a lot about stick with the
game plan. Right. Meta kind of gave you
that sort of foundation, right? From
what I understand, they give you a sort
of blueprint or gameplay to follow. Uh
where a lot of the heavy strategy work
was kind of already done for you, right?
And basically you just had to go there
and execute. If you had to explain the
meta methodology, how would you describe
this approach?
&gt;&gt; Yes. So you join like as a completely
new like you don't understand anything
about theory or anything and they just
give you a blueprint like so on a single
spot on this kind of board you are going
to bet range on this turn you're going
to bet this size on the river you're
going to bluff this this this. So it's
like a yeah exactly a blueprint that
anybody can follow you know you just
read you you you you
follow the instructions and reply that
in game on your game and you are going
to to to win you know so you don't need
to understand theory you don't need to
understand range interactions you don't
need to understand blockers you don't
need to understand anything you just
follow what is there and you are going
to make money of course like for lower
stakes and micro stakes, lower stakes
and even mistakes. When you get higher,
you you you you
have to improve and and learn theory and
and and get sharper of the game, but
they develop a strategy like that you
anybody that follows can can can win,
you know.
&gt;&gt; What are the strengths of having like a
pre-built strategy to follow?
the strengths. I think like when you are
starting at poker like and you have like
learning GTO and study GTO is really
complex for a new guys like Zabur like
is he's going to take a lot of time to
to to know how to to look in into Sims
and how to navigate through the server
and how to interpretate like the things
that the server says. So when you have
like a a predefined strategy and the guy
is trying to make a living for broker
and he's trying to to make some money
when he have like a such a simplified
strategy that is so easy to follow and
he just need to do that it to give him
the confidence okay it's possible to
make money you can win in this game you
can make a living on that and that's is
it's really necessary to to give you
like the the first start you know okay I
can quit my job I can make money with
that and then you start to
getting sharper and sharper and study
GTO and get way deeper in the game. But
it gave you the initial start to to to
to everything, you know, to to see that
it's possible to to to make money
playing the game.
&gt;&gt; How does it then evolve? You kind of
said you you said a couple times, you
know, works really well in the
beginning. And how is it how does it
evolve after you go up in the stakes?
&gt;&gt; I I I think I I was playing only mediate
two 200, you know. I was playing only
MDA like not not even studying anything
about t like only playing MDA to 200 L
and I was already doing a lot of money
playing 200 like putting a lot of volume
get a lot of rake back with just MDA you
know I was just playing MDA and making a
lot of money playing 200 but then when
we started going like to 500 1k the the
leaks on the pool start to be not that
relevant you know like the the pool
start to not having that much leaks they
they start to to adapt as with you. They
see you exploiting exploiting all the
time and they start to to to counter
exploit you and that hurts a lot even
more than exploiting you know. So when
you are exploiting you are getting
counter exploit is going to to bleed a
lot of money. So you have to start to
developing GTO strategy and
understanding GTO and being more
balancing, being more protected and
overall having like a a solid solid GTO
game like you need that to play against
tougher opponents because they're going
to pick up, you know.
&gt;&gt; Are there like some things in the
blueprint that you still apply up until
today, for example?
&gt;&gt; No, not anymore. Yeah, like I it's
always in your like in your
mindset and your thought process because
you remember, okay, this line is
overbluffed, this line is under bluffed,
like this blah blah blah. But like these
are not the guys that are over bluffing
or the bluffing, you know. So you you
shouldn't like trust like they are the
outliners of the MDA, you know? They are
not the mess from the like from the MDA.
They're not the mess. They are the
outliers. So you shouldn't like really
uh apply that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we did a we did a podcast. I
forgot the name, but he also said like,
"Yeah, you have this MD entity guys, you
know, they base their strategy off of
MDA and then they come to play at
Tritons and they apply that, but they
don't really realize that the population
they're now playing against is a little
bit different than the population they
did their MDA strategies on."
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. So MDA is not that
mass database analysis. So they are
going to give you like the leaks of the
mass but when you are playing that high
you are not playing against the mass you
are playing like against the the guys
that are not doing that you know so yeah
not a really good idea to to follow MDA
playing against Lionus and David you are
I think one of the if not the most
successful player I think that that
probably came through meta um why do you
think you succeeded with it when others
didn't obviously everyone one, they get
the same blueprint, they get the same
coaching, but here you are, and I'm sure
many kind of stopped along the way or
didn't have the same success you did.
So, why do you think uh the players
failed despite getting the same advice?
And why and what set you apart? Why did
you succeed?
&gt;&gt; Um, I don't know, man. Like,
I was never good at at football, for
example. I was going to the kids with
the football class and I just suck and
there was kids that were good at this
like so I think it's just some people
have like a natural talent for some some
things and they do some things better
than other. I suck at a lot of things
that I do and I'm good at poker. I think
that's just life you know and also like
I I really dedicate myself. I love the
game and I spent countless hours
studying and playing. But I think there
is also a big factor of uh just having a
natural talent for some things some
people have and some people don't.
&gt;&gt; You think it's also
uh that the mythology and how you were
taught just kind of resonated well with
you? You think that plays a part? You
think certain approaches can resonate
better with one person, less with
another?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so. I I I don't know how
how did how much important is it but for
sure is it affect you know like okay do
that like go and do that for but for
some people like oh maybe not here okay
like then they try to like oh I I don't
believe this this immediate stuff okay
uh I don't think okay but on this board
or on this texture he is not going to
bluff and they try to like think with
their own heads when they don't know
[ __ ] about poker so they they try to
deviate And I I was never that guy like
I was I always follow the instructions
you know do that I did that do this I do
this. So yeah.
&gt;&gt; What about uh your strength in terms of
volume? Uh in the beginning of the
conversation you said that uh prior to
you know jumping in these high stakes
games you you were playing over 200k
hands a month at ACR to try to get this
challenge. And from what I heard from
you in general you're a super high
volume grinder. That obviously is
something I think that would set you
apart from some of the other students
that maybe started with you. You think
what do you think is the benefits of
being a high volume player?
You you get more experience, right? Like
of course like you you learn by by
studying but
playing also gives you experience like I
giving intuition is like is a big role
like of how much you play like you see
like experienced players have good
intuition because they have gone through
that spot many many many times against a
lot of type of players against like
everyone's and they're doing that over
and over and over and over again they
are seeing the results maybe they're not
tracking it but in your subconscious
because you you have been there many
many times. So it it make you like uh it
make make you have like a a better
feeling at the game I think. So, and
also you make more money, right? You you
you
as much like you are play well if you're
if you can play well for for that many
hands like as much the more you play the
more the more you earn, you know? So,
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I guess that's not necessarily
guaranteed for everyone, right? Because
I I think if you push it too much with
the amount of tables you play or the
amount of hand they play, I feel like
then for some players they fail to
improve. How were you able to put in
that match hours? I don't know. Maybe
were you playing a lot of tables or a
lot of hours? Maybe to also clarify that
&gt;&gt; 200 200k hands.
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt; It was like I think five zones, six
zones and two regular tables. like 18
tables, 80 tables, like six zones, two
regulars, like a lot of tables and a lot
of hours. All all of them combined.
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess if you play 200k,
you can't you have to combine the two
because I'm asking that because I feel
like there's a lot of players if you
only focus on volume, they kind of feel
on the improvement side, but you seem to
find that balance.
Yeah, like as I say like I think like
the fact that I enjoy so much is make me
make it easier for me to play for long
hours and and have like uh good results
because I'm enjoying the moment you know
uh I'm not like oh I can't play anymore
like I'm I'm thrilled to be that like
like I'm enjoying the moment so make me
be more focused and be more present and
take better decisions because I'm I'm
enjoying that you know
&gt;&gt; what about curiosity
Yeah, I definitely play like a big big
role, you know, like but I I have never
been like the really studious guy like
that spent hours on on solvers. I was I
always more of the the grinder, you
know, but the grinder that if I have a
doubt and I will stop the grind and and
stud like between the sessions I like I
I'm checking hands between my my breaks
and like all of this. But I'm not the
guy like oh I stayed I stud like four
hours a day I spend three hours. No, I
spend like 10 hours playing and
sometimes I review some hands and that's
it. So from that point of view,
especially when you joined the stable,
it was kind of a match made in heaven,
right? They want someone to grind and
you want someone to do the strategy for
you.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Perfect combination. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; So, but I think also what you said there
like I think a lot of players who go for
a high volume, they might not enjoy it
as much as you and they kind of look
like, oh [ __ ] I have to play another 5k
hands today. Did you understand that's
kind of becomes their main objective
like a finally five dozen hands where it
seemed like you were still enjoying the
game. You were trying to get better. or
you were still curious for situations. I
think that's definitely a different like
you can approach the high volume grind
more for the sake of high volume or just
it's a result of you really really want
enjoying it. You want to get in spots
and you want to get better.
I think it's just like for for the love
of of the grind like especially the
beginning now I'm not like that anymore
like playing higher like I don't feel
like that the necessity of playing a lot
but early in my career like I I want to
do that you know like if I play like
100ks in the month I was like oh I want
to play more like like if I take a a
break or going to holidays I was looking
forward to come back home and play you
know so this was not I was not forcing
myself to do that. I I was doing because
I want to do that. So yeah.
&gt;&gt; Are there any downsides of uh playing
this high volume?
&gt;&gt; Uh yeah, for sure man. Like it's way
easier to get like tilted than like even
like I could say like I don't tilted a
lot a lot. But when you are playing that
high volume is impossible to to to
always be on like on your A game. you
are going to play on BC E game and
you're going to tilt a lot and your your
routine is going to suck because you're
going to play like two late nights and
you are going to wake up at at 12 12
p.m. and you are going to sleep bad and
you're not going to exercise. There is a
lot of downsides. So yeah, I definitely
have a way healthier life now that I
don't do this this thing and I'm
enjoying a lot more now too. like I I I
I prefer like the the life that I have
now, but I think it was necessary to to
became the player that I am and I think
it's play a big role on that.
&gt;&gt; I think this this comes back to this
conversation often as well, right? It's
not like you just kept on doing it.
You're like, "Oh, this has some
downsides and you try to learn from the
experience and try to improve and that's
kind of how you kept on uh moving
offwards." To give people an idea like
you you said that you were uh not
stubborn, right? You said, "Okay,
there's people smart and mood." They
gave they made me this strategy. Why
would I think for myself? Uh, I think I
think I heard you mentioned that
together combined with a high volume and
you're very rigid in following the
blueprint that at some point the sides
thought you were a bot.
Yeah. Yeah. I think I was playing like
10 and 25. No. Yeah. I think I was
playing 25 and
I got banned at at 888 Poker 2 because
they thought I was a bot because I was
playing like early like I have like two
two months in my poker career. I was
already playing like 25 and now I think
and I was always playing like 150k hands
a hand 150k hands a month and just
playing blueprint and never change the
strategy like doesn't matter the time or
I was just playing like
like a bot you know like you give like I
script to the bot and he play like 150k
hands in the month always doing the same
thing doesn't matter the player he's
playing against it doesn't matter he's a
fish he's a rag like he's always doing
the same thing and I was doing that but
it was actually me just following the
blueprint and being a man.
That's how uh I I really like this
example because if you get detected by
by a bot that shows like you know how
much of a a robot you were in terms of
okay I sit down make the hours and
execute the game plan. Over time uh I'm
sure you you have evolved beyond the
blueprint and you gave your own twist to
things. How has your methodology
evolved? What's the biggest difference
between the metagame blueprint and the
the billin blueprint I guess we could
call it?
Yeah, I think I I already talked about
that like trying to not follow like here
you have to do that, here you have to do
this. Like really go with my experience
and my intuition and I think it's a mix
like of what I understand of UTO. I
still have like a lot of understand I
still have like a lot of things to to
stud and get a banner but I try to to to
follow more like simplified strategy. I
still like to play really simplified
like I simplify a lot on if I can bat
range on on a flop I was bat range like
I try to to simplify a lot is something
that I have coached with Martinelli too
and yeah I learned a lot with him like
playing simplified the stretches on flop
and just like trying to RNG turn and mix
the stretch and turn like on GTO concept
and intuition mover so it's like a mix
of a lot of things.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's quite that that's quite uh
that's that's quite the evolvement. So,
to kind of to kind of recap, if you can
simplify and flop, that's where you like
to simplify on turn, you mix and review,
you let intuition take over.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. kind kind of like that. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Could you maybe give an example of like
I think flop simplifications everyone's
pretty familiar with, but could you
maybe give an example of like turn
approaches
&gt;&gt; and how that has?
So I'm I'm play like a c bet range on
the flop and then on the turn. Okay. Now
here I know that I have to bet 25% of my
airs and I have like to my my draws I
have to be bet 50% of the time and my
top pairs I have to bet 80% of the time.
So I just RNG and go with that. Like I
try to be like more GTO oriented on on
turns and rivers too like like I try to
to to think about a GTO perspective but
as I say I take my intuition in
consideration too. I take my wheels in
consideration and I try to not be like
RNG using RNG on rivers to to take the
you know
&gt;&gt; when you say on the turn okay I know I
have to pick air 25% the time does it
matter which air like is there a false
process before that like okay I have a
good candidate because like in certain
situations obviously certain hands are
preferred or certain top pairs are
absolutely or relatively better than
others etc etc or do you try to keep it
as simple as okay top pair I have a Dep
depends on the spot. If it the spots I
know deeper, I I'm going to do that. I'm
going to go deeper on blockers and what
kind of air, what kind of top air, but I
have like if the spot I didn't like not
as sharp as as I want like if I don't
know the spot too much, I will
simplified it. You know, oh is air is
air is stop air stop air. So if I'm not
sharp as sharp as I want on the spot, I
will be more simplified. But if I went
through the spot and I and I I know that
the theory uh response I will I will
follow it you know. So I simplify where
I don't have like clear answers.
&gt;&gt; Do you think that's uh what what what
benefit do you think that that approach
gives you
&gt;&gt; with to not have to to think a lot and
and and like spend a lot of times on
little details you know. Oh, here I want
to bat with the seven spades but not of
the seven of hearts. And this drain a
lot of energy, you know, like being so
precise drains a lot of energy. And when
you are playing like a lot of volume, if
you try to do that on every hand, you
are going to get [ __ ] you know, it's
really hard to to play a lot of lot of
hands and being so sharp on all of your
decisions. So if you can't have a a
strategy that you can simplify and not
lose a lot of V, you know, okay, if I do
that, I I will be correct. I will maybe
make a little bit mistakes sometimes,
but it's not going to be like a a
blunder. It's going to be like a
a frequency mistake. And this it's not
going to be a big thing. this uh make
you not not spend a lot of energy, you
know, so you you you can be like like
spend more energy on the your river
decision or on other things or on the
other table that there's some big big
hand going on. So yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of what I thought like
you you save your energy for more
thinking when you're on the river,
right? Where basically the EV of your
disposition is greater. But you did say
like, okay, there's spots where I do
know I have more knowledge or or this
combo is better, blah, blah, blah. But
then it becomes intuitive, right? So you
don't have to waste that brain power on
it. It's more like, okay, I don't
clearly don't know the spot. I can now
spend 30 seconds using all my brain
power or I can just fall back to the the
thing that I know and any note, you
know, I should have 25% of my error.
Well, this is air. I'll just RNG 25% of
R. I think it also really raises your
floor, right? I feel like in poker
everyone like you can improve in two
ways in poker. You can try to play
better or you can try to play less worse
basically, right? And I feel like this
is a nice default to to fall back on.
Well, at least I know that, you know, if
I just RNG air 25% of the time, then at
least my floor is pretty solid. Exactly.
Like it's so hard, man, like to to have
like all the the response for poker. The
game is so big and like it's
it's so hard to be like so precise with
like GTO arises on every node like you
you you need simpl you need to have like
a some kind of uh simplification like to
perform at least on a on a good level
and then as the time goes on you start
to going deeper deeper and you know so
you have to like have a a default plan
to to don't as you say like have a floor
and that's it I'm not going to lose a
lot if I do that. But as time go goes
like you you don't have to rush like you
start to understand the spot better.
You're going to be there again and you
are going to stud and yeah I try to I
don't I try not to rush things that oh I
need to to know this and that all of the
time. I I try to have like some kind of
simplifications that I just can with
time like learn and get better. I think
it is important to add for for the
listeners uh obviously what you think is
simple might be different what a
simplified strategy is for someone
listening right playing 20010 that
that's one but also like this is not the
end point like it's something that you
fall back on when you have no other
things going on right like I said it's
kind of to make sure that you raise the
floor and from there I feel like if you
have that baseline uh it allows you to
spend more time on making better
decisions right So it's an enabler and
not the end point. Whereas I feel like a
lot of players get this wrong. They they
build their baseline strategy and they
think like okay this is the end. I made
my strategy now I can just execute. But
okay no this is this is like your
foundation. From here you can start to
play poker.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Um we already talked about like uh the
analogy between poker and a video game
where you have to kind of race through
the ranks. When you look back at your
journey through the stakes, was there
any jump in stakes that you find harder
than than than others?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. Only one like I I I
always only took one shot. I took one
shot at all the stakes that I that I
that I have gone except for 1K. 1K. I
think I took like 20 shots and I failed
on all of them. I I I think it like it
was so hard, man. so hard like because I
always had like such an easy run like I
was just like going through the stakes
and having no like hard times and when I
get to 1K like I just couldn't beat it.
I was go take shots, lose, go take shots
and it took like more than a year like
maybe two years trying to to beat 1k.
&gt;&gt; What made you kept on shutting? I think
at some point people listening if they
take a shot 10 times at some point
they're like well I guess this is not
for me you know I know you you you live
in Brazil right 500l you can make a good
living you can have quite a comfortable
life like I know that this the money was
not your your motivator but I can
imagine after like the 15th time you're
like maybe it's not for me
&gt;&gt; n I will feel like a loser okay 15 times
okay I can't this is not my type I
wouldn't let go like I would keep trying
until I do it like no way I would stop
trying after 15 times and I was like
just like go oh okay uh 1k is too hard
for me no way man
&gt;&gt; what is it about 1k particular the pool
the side whatever or about your approach
that made this shot so difficult why why
do you kept on failing
&gt;&gt; I think there was so many things like I
I have like a lot of things to get
better at my game I have a lot of things
to fix. I have like I also like didn't
have like a good bank row so I was like
playing with money pressure and man I
think everything like everything like I
need to be more mature because I was
taking shots with at 1K with like one
year and a half of poker you know so I
was not you can't be like that good with
that little time you know so I just need
time I need to get better at poker I
need to get better at my mental game
everything everything
&gt;&gt; and the only way to get better at it was
taking shots.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I I need to know if I got
better, you know. So, I took the shot, I
went back, work, try to take the shot
again. Okay, it's not enough. Went back
again, take the shot again. So, yeah, I
I kept trying.
&gt;&gt; You said that you uh had many leaks in
your game that you had to fix. Do you
recall maybe certain bigger leaks? Uh
and how did you go about fixing them?
being way too station. I'm still am, but
not as I used to be. Like I was way too
station, way too station playing on a
few that people were not that aggressive
on GG. So I was calling everyone and
nobody was bluffing. So that's a a big
reason like it's really hard to make
money when you are calling everyone and
nobody's bluffing and I was bluffing
also everyone. I was being extremely
aggressive and people had already pick
up on they knew I was doing that and
they were just calling me down a lot. So
I was just spewing and get calling and
calling everyone and not getting
bluffed. So yeah, maybe it's hard to to
beat a game when you were doing
something like that.
&gt;&gt; What eventually clicked? Why did uh I
think you said 20 shots. Why did the
20th shot work?
&gt;&gt; I don't know, man. I just kept trying
and it worked. You know, [laughter] I I
think like the big part was like between
those shots, I was say, "Oh man, it's
enough like I can't take more shots. I
need to make money." Then I went to to
make the the challenge on ACR, you know,
and then I was like playing a lot of
volume and I was trying a lot of
strategies because my strategies before
were not working to to beat 1k. So I
started to try a lot of things. I even
play like I'm going to play blueprint
again. I'm going to play only GTO. I'm
going to play and then like I mixed the
boat. I'm gonna play blueprint with GTO
and then then I have like as I say in
the beginning I had a a class with solo
and he say man following your intuition
your intuition is always right like you
have like a really good intuition. I did
that and I have like my best mode in the
challenge and I started to to take that
more in consideration and and be a more
like a kind of need to achieve player
and it's going it's going really well
since then.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like you mentioned that seemed to
be like probably the biggest
breakthrough moment in your career.
Probably the best advice you've ever
been giving. On the flip side, what do
you what is kind of the worst advice
you've ever been given or that you hear
a lot in the poker community that you
don't necessarily agree with?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you you have to call this hand.
You need to call this hand like this.
Such a [ __ ] man. Like
&gt;&gt; what is flawed about it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you don't have to do anything. You
are not obligated to do anything. You
can do whatever you want. You know, you
don't have to, you are not obligated to
do anything because like a scene told
you to do. Like you are not playing
against robots. Nobody's playing GTO.
Some people are playing closer. Some
people are almost playing GTO, but most
of the guys are not playing against
people that are even playing closer to
GTO. So, you are not obligated to do
anything. Like, you can make deviations
and you can like go with your reads way
more than you think. Coin Poker is one
of the fastest growing poker rooms out
there. And from what I've seen and
experienced, it feels generally built
with players in mind. They got fast
payment processing, a global player
pool, and a clear focus on
sustainability and communitydriven
development. They have been very
innovative, rolling out things like the
Cash Game World Championship and the
recent addition of 72 bounty tables,
which says a lot about the direction
they're going. As part of that growth
and innovation, Coin Poker is running
its winter series from December 26th
until January 26th with 10 million
guaranteed across the series. This is
currently one of the sites I like to go
and play. But hey, that's just my take.
I'm sharing this forformational purposes
only. If you want to take a look into it
further, there are more details in the
description down below. You mentioned
before that you are addicted to playing.
Obviously you said also by playing you
can get better especially the way you
approach it. Did you how did your
studying look like uh um when when when
going through the ranks like you said
that you know you were mainly focused on
playing but I assumed you did some
studying. What kind of forms of
improving on your game worked for you
and how has that process evolved over
the time?
&gt;&gt; Oh for I I have always been studying.
I've just like was not like the guy that
studs more than play. I have never been
this guy but I have always been
studying. I'm studying with all the ways
you can imagine like group studies
studies by myself with solver with data
studying like I love watching videos
actually I love to see people's playing
and explaining the thought process it's
one of the things that I like to do most
like I watched all the the content
creators from YouTube all their videos
over and over like I I've watched like
all the videos available at at meta game
like I love to see people playing and
and talking telling about that their
thought process. I think I I can like
absorb a lot of that. So I did all all
of all all of of the studs that are
possible like group studying solid
studing studies with silver reviewing
hands. I I do everything a little bit
you know
&gt;&gt; out of these which for you have been
most effective?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Now I think like
uh
for sure like watching people play and
see like but not just people playing and
and and chatting like when people are
playing and explaining all all of their
thought process you know okay this hand
I'm going to do that because my range
wanted to do that and I you know like I
like I like this this approach like I I
feel like when I watch people play I can
take good things like see how he
approached the games and sometimes it it
even helps me more than looking at the
scene you know because sometimes I look
at the scene I'm just like see
frequencies but I I don't understand the
concept and sometimes I'm I'm seeing
somebody play and he he explain why you
know here your your range are going to
do this because of that that that and
that's that clicks for me sometimes more
than look at a thing you know
&gt;&gt; so like for example the guy making the
video has already processed it and now
says it in his thought process and
that's easier for you to soak in.
So you think you've always again we kind
of come back to like working in a team
right at Meta or in a stable you have
people around you kind of doing all this
work and then they can explain you a
concept or playing. Is that like the
best? Are you more like a sponge? So if
you're around the right people you soak
up all their you soak up all their
knowledge and you straight away go into
execution mode.
Being a sponge is a great is a great
quality. Um, what advice would you have
for uh for midstakes players who are
fired up by raiding you and seeing you
watch the Casame World Championship and
they want to one day compete in it as
well, but currently, you know, they feel
a bit stuck, don't see the road ahead
clearly. Any tips or recommendations?
What should they be uh be focusing on in
order to uh next year take a shot as
well like you did? M yeah like be brave,
gr hard, stud hard like there's no
secret everybody knows what you have to
do right just put in the hours lock in
and yeah like don't fear like
be brave like take the shots put the
hours and that's it there there's no
secret
when you say be brave and don't fear how
does it look in practice Like how can
people like okay I I should be brave?
What what should they be brave at? What
how do we turn the word brave into
action?
Just do it. Right. Okay. So you want to
take the shot? Go take the shot. Try it.
Fail. Do it again. Fail again. Try
again. Fail again. So just just go and
do it. Don't overthink. Don't don't
don't
put yourself like in one spot as you
think you can do it. Just believe in
yourself and and try.
But what if they're afraid
&gt;&gt; or it makes them feel uncomfortable?
&gt;&gt; You are you are going to be afraid,
right? If you if you didn't feel afraid,
you won't be a challenge. You know,
challenges are going to feel afraid. You
are going to feel fear and you're going
to be afraid. And that's part of it. You
got to face and do it and learn with
that. Like there's no no other way. Like
you got to do it. You got to go and do
it besides feeling afraid or or having
fear or you got to do it. You just got
to go and do it and and and and try.
&gt;&gt; You said the magic word despite and
that's kind of why why I asked the
question. I hope this would kind of come
out. You said despite being afraid still
take the action because people a lot of
times they they feel their insecurities
or their fears and they see that as a
sign that they are not ready yet.
&gt;&gt; Whereas you now say like it's it's part
of it. Be brave.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You are always going to feel that
you know like all the fighters all the
the athletes from every sport they they
all have fear they fear before
a a fight they fear before a match like
they they are anxious like it's part of
it like you just got to go and do that
despite the fear like just go but Pedro
I I I don't feel confident enough in my
game and I still have a lot of leaks
then go instead go get better and try
again.
&gt;&gt; But keep on trying, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; And then that's it, right? You don't
know if your game is good enough for the
next unless you try it.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. Then you you fail
again and then you work on your game
again and you try again and you just
repeat that.
&gt;&gt; Adam, what does uh be brave and don't
fear? What what do you think about when
you hear that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think Pedro summarized it great.
It's not don't fear. You do feel the
fear. Being brave is feeling the fear
and taking the action anyway. And I
think often, as you mentioned there, NA,
the problem people have is they get
stuck in the fear and they let the fear
drive decisions. When in reality, if you
if you let the fear speak and act out,
it often leads us to retreat to play
things safe to protect ourselves. But
being brave means just stepping into
that and stepping into that for the
right reasons. So yeah, I love Pedro's
approach because it's it just simplifies
things. is like imagine you're sitting
watching this and you go right I want a
shot take the next level let's say you
got the bank roll for it one you can
study to get yourself ready for it but
at some point you go right play play the
games then you either get beat lose some
balance or you have a good run and
that's just a data point okay cool it
wasn't good enough back to studying go
again and just create that kind of
feedback loop it sounds like for you
Pedro you're very good just create a
kind of game out of that all right if
I'm not good enough yet I will just go
again and get better so for you like I
think the challenge with this I'm trying
to internalize this for somebody else
they might use the failed attempt as
proof they weren't good enough and their
confidence is a bit more fragile than
yours. So let's say you've got a high
belief in yourself that you can always
learn, get better, then yes, just keep
going for it, keep trying. But what
happens if each attempt chips away your
confidence where you go, h this is proof
that I'm not quite ready? Have you had
any issues with your ego, self-belief as
you've had failed attempts?
&gt;&gt; No. No, never. I always believe it. Like
I always get frustrated for sure. Oh my
god. I I didn't do it again and again
but I I never like thought oh this is
not for me. Like I know it was just
matter of time just matter of keeping
putting the work and getting better that
eventually you you will do it like we
are humans like everybody we breathe air
so it's fair game.
&gt;&gt; Does that internal belief come from your
ability to think you're always learning
getting better? Do you feel like you're
someone who uh if you're not good enough
yet, you'll get better and come back as
a better version who will be to win?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. This is not only in
poker, right? In life and everything
like
everything that you do, you have to
learn how to do and you are not good at
the beginning. Everything is like
trying, repeating, fail, repeating,
fail, repeating, trying, trying,
improve, get better, fail again.
Everything in life is about that. And
poker is just like another thing from
the from life that you have to have the
same approach.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think if you take that approach,
you build resilience, you build the
ability to fail, come back again. And I
feel like some people who don't really
try things, who aren't brave, who don't
step into their fears. Often they uh
they use defeat as a kind of almost like
a validation that they weren't good
enough or to justify that it wasn't
quite the right path. Whereas for you,
it's just a game of I'm going to make
this jump. I am going to get better. and
no matter what knocks me back in the
short term, I will learn from that and
get better. So, I think it's a good
thing to uh internalize anyone who's not
quite there yet, try to think of how you
could build your own confidence by
learning from mistakes, getting better
because if you learn from mistakes, then
there's going to be a point where you
learn so much and you get so good that
you make it less mistakes and you become
so good that you can't fail. That's not
actually true cuz various can always
[ __ ] with you, but you get to where
failure becomes very small.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. For sure, man. For sure.
&gt;&gt; All right. I want to do a rapid fire
with you now, Pedro. So, the way this
works is I'm going to ask short
questions and your goal is to use your
intuition and answer them as quick as
possible. Whatever comes to mind.
There's no right or wrong answers. If
you need to pause, no problem, but just
as quick as whatever comes to mind.
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; All right. First question. Describe your
poker game in one sentence.
&gt;&gt; Aggressive.
&gt;&gt; This could be the same answer, but
what's the one word you hope people use
when describing your playing style?
&gt;&gt; Solid.
&gt;&gt; What's the most overrated concept in
poker?
&gt;&gt; That's hard.
overrated concept. It's it's not a short
answer, but I don't think there's an
overrated concept. Depends on how you
use it, you know, depends on how you you
approach. Like a concept is a concept
and it's going to be important. You you
don't have like a bad concept. If it's a
concept, it's important, but depends on
how you use it, you know, depends on how
you you translate that to your game. So,
I I don't have like a a clear answer for
that. Depends on the on the on the guy.
What's the most misapplied concept?
&gt;&gt; Misapplied concept. GTO for sure.
&gt;&gt; What's the biggest adrenaline rush?
Skateboarding down a steep hill or the
final table, final day of the cash game
world championships?
&gt;&gt; Downhill for sure.
&gt;&gt; What's the most underrated skill that
high stakes poker players have?
&gt;&gt; Underrated skill. Resilience.
&gt;&gt; Who surprised you the most in the cash
game world championships?
&gt;&gt; Probably.
&gt;&gt; What do you think gives you the biggest
edge at midstakes, MDA or GTO?
Mistakes. MDA for sure.
&gt;&gt; What's one spot you think you understand
better than almost everyone you play
against?
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; There you go. Which item would you have
loved to have smashed back in your
tilting days?
&gt;&gt; Oh, the monitor for sure.
&gt;&gt; What's been the worst habit that you've
had to break in your poke career?
&gt;&gt; Not exercising. Not making not
practicing exercising.
&gt;&gt; What's low plus EV in high stakes? At
high stakes, intuition or discipline?
discipline for sure.
&gt;&gt; If you couldn't play poker ever again,
what would you say someone next?
&gt;&gt; Skates or motorcycle or something like
that. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Something that spikes adrenaline, no
doubt.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right, cool. That's the rapid fire.
So, now we're going to go into some
reflecting questions. You can take
longer and no pressure to answer them in
one sentence. H. Yeah. For you, what
would you say has been the most
important lesson poker has taught you
about yourself or about life?
Just keep trying.
Keep trying. Yeah.
How is it taught you that? By like it's
just not moving up mistakes but also
like applying the strategies like you
learn some strategy and you go and
execute that and you can execute that
and go wrong for a lot of times and you
just have to keep doing the right thing
and the results will eventually come,
you know. So just keep trying, keep
doing what is right and things are going
to to work
&gt;&gt; for you. Do you set yourself any uh time
frames? Because I feel like with that
approach, it's so good when you uh
remove time restrictions, but I think a
lot of us work towards goals in terms of
achieving x outcome by the end of the
year or by a few years time. Do you
create any time bounded goals for
yourself? Are you somebody who just lets
things take as long as they take? No, by
the end of the year, I always set goals
for for myself.
&gt;&gt; What was your goal this year?
&gt;&gt; Having the best years this year for my
career and consolid uh consolidate
myself as a high stakes cash game
player.
&gt;&gt; Mission accomplished. No doubt.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What do you think has been the greatest
contributor to your success? If you
could package what has led you to be
successful into let's say three traits
or attributes, what comes to mind for
the package of you being a successful?
&gt;&gt; Obsession.
&gt;&gt; Obsession one. Any other side traits?
&gt;&gt; Obsession and like uh for sure having
like a uh a community that I can rely
on. for you. When you say obsession, how
does that feel day-to-day? Is it a drive
just to learn, to get better? Is it
almost like you can't not study? You
can't not play. You're driven so much.
How does obsession show up for you
dayto-day?
&gt;&gt; I think as you say, like I cannot not
play. I cannot don't like I I think
about that all of the time like and if I
trying to do other stuffs, I'm still
thinking about poker. So like I just
can't turn off my head, you know.
&gt;&gt; Has there been any times where
obsessions pushed you too far in terms
of maybe burning out, maybe not giving
yourself time to recover and maybe the
obsession has been a a negative impact
in in a short period?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, many times. many times like didn't
have like getting proper sleep because I
want to wake up and play again and or
because like I really want to get out of
the down swing and I was like playing
more than I should not taking rests and
like being tilted like for sure many
times.
&gt;&gt; How have you learned to balance that as
you matured?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What have been the main changes you've
had to make?
&gt;&gt; Uh like I have to like I didn't never
had a routine. I was just playing
playing playing sleep whenever I want
and wake up and whenever I want and
eating whenever I want and not
exercising and just left having like
really bad habits. So I just get way
better at that. Like I I have like my
routine like I have like my hours to
play, my hours to sleep, hours to eat,
to practice exercise. So I completely
changed that and I improved a lot for
sure doing that.
What what are some of the
non-negotiables on your routine? You
mentioned some there in terms of your
grinding hours, studying, you mentioned
your sleep hours, exercise,
&gt;&gt; sleeping hours. Sleeping hours is like
the number one. Like I need to have like
proper sleep and sleep well. Like that's
number one. It's like sleeping is
actually the only thing that makes me
not grind if I didn't get, you know,
like if I didn't have good sleep, if I'm
not feeling well. Because if I don't
have like the hours that I need to
sleep, like I don't feel I feel like
[ __ ] all the day. So that's something
that stops me from grinding. Exercise is
like another thing that I I'm always
putting on the on the routine, but it's
something that if I don't do I I will
still grind, you know, and sleep. No, I
sleep like number one.
&gt;&gt; How much sleep do you need to perform at
your best?
&gt;&gt; Eight hours, seven hours and a half,
something like that. But I sleep really
well. Like I I I sleep like my I I lay
lay in my bed and I'm completely gone
for eight hours and seven hours. If I
have that interrupted or if I hang over
like I will feel like really bad you
know like I'm really good sleeper but if
I don't have it like I will feel like
[ __ ]
&gt;&gt; So if you don't sleep well let's say
it's it's a normally day for whatever
reason would you then reallocate that
day towards more studying? Would you
have more of a rest day? How do you kind
of use that
&gt;&gt; rest? Yeah. Yeah. Rest. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And what forms of rest would you use
throughout the day?
&gt;&gt; Sleep. [laughter]
sleep like or just chill like watch a
movie with with with my with my girl uh
going like to visit my mom or do
something like not related to you know
&gt;&gt; so this year has been a big breakthrough
year for you I think you said the start
of the year was you're playing NL 200 or
at least late last year now you're
playing NL5 game when you look back on
the year what are you most proud of
&gt;&gt; the challenge for sure winning the
challenge was like amazing man like best
experience I had so far in the in my
career like was so intense like playing
against the best in the world being able
to to do well and booking the win like
was insane man insane insane. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Have you had enough time to internalize
that yet in terms how it feels for you
in terms of how it might impact your
goals going forward or is it still quite
fresh?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I still I still sometimes think
and oh my god I I won the [ __ ] like I
still like like didn't like believe it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
Going forward, what do you think excites
you the most? What do you feel like will
be uh the next challenge to take on?
Obviously, maybe next year they might
run another version. What do you feel
like going forward based on how well and
how much you've enjoyed this challenge?
What are some things that you want want
to do next year in related to that?
&gt;&gt; Probably play higher, you know, find
higher games than the ones that I have
now. Maybe some live games and maybe
some other other opportunities on on
other sides online to play higher. I
want to play higher. Do you feel like
you got anything left to prove to
yourself?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. Always.
&gt;&gt; What's that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't think nothing changed.
Like winning the challenge was just like
a good result that I have over 40 key
hands, but I I didn't prove myself like
I don't think I like I still in in the
uh the top players in the world. So, I
want to become one of them, but I still
have a lot a lot of work to do.
When you say the top players, how many
people do you generally rate in the top
tier? I know it's hard to name names,
but is there like five guys, 10 guys who
are quite far ahead?
&gt;&gt; 10 guys? Yeah, there are a lot of 10
guys that you can name like really fast.
&gt;&gt; And do you feel like you're just behind
those wanted to break in? Still a little
bit of work to establish yourself in
that elite.
&gt;&gt; I I don't know if I'm behind, but I
still didn't have like time to prove it.
You know, I just joined like those
stakes. Like I don't know how well I'm
going to do over a big sample. So, I
still have to prove myself.
&gt;&gt; So, for you, you mentioned that the
other players in the challenge had a lot
more experience. Those elite 10 guys,
I'm sure most of them, maybe prodigies,
one of the younger ones, most of them
been around a long time, got a lot of
experience. How do you feel like you've
been able to close your gap, at least
the gap, and at least get yourself in
the conversation with those players in a
short space of time? Is it the obsessive
drive? Is it something else you feel
like allowed you to uh to close the gap
quickly?
&gt;&gt; You say during the challenge, like how
or no? in general like if you look at
the the players who are above you maybe
the top 10 guys or whoever it is they've
played a lot lot longer than you your
career has been a lot shorter you
mentioned like some guys have played 10
years at the top maybe uh in that range
so for you like how do you feel like
you've been able to get yourself in the
conversations in such a relatively short
space of time
&gt;&gt; yeah definitely like obsession like and
I think like many of the guys that are
there have been like me you know they
has been obsess obsessive with the game
and maybe they are still are and that's
why they are who they are So yeah.
&gt;&gt; Do you think it's easier for someone
who's on the come up like you Prodigy?
Maybe Prodigy's more established these
days, but do you feel like the guys who
are hungry to get this for the first
time, it's a bit of an easier job for
them rather than the guys who've been
more established like a Lionus for many
years? Do you think there's a a dynamic
there which plays into the young
challenger over the the older
established champ?
&gt;&gt; You kind think it's easier like for me
and project like No, I don't think so. I
think like maybe it's kind of the same
like I don't know when those guys uh
established themselves as like the best.
I don't know how the field was back
then. Uh I don't know if if if today is
harder or no, but I we are all going to
have like similar challenges. So I think
it's like similar.
&gt;&gt; Outside of the high stakes cash game
games, do you see yourself playing any
other big live stops? Do you see
yourself want to play the Tritons?
What's the future hold for you? Yeah,
I'm going to start to play more entities
this year, like not not on the on on my
daily grind like but on Sundays and on
on weekends I'm going to start to stud
and play more.
So yeah, maybe some hypes too. Let's
see.
&gt;&gt; What is it about tournaments that you
excited about?
&gt;&gt; Competition for sure. Like the last days
that I had on the challenge like you
always have that on close to that on on
on tournaments, right? like have the
final tables, have a deep run, and you
have like this feeling that you never
have on cash games, you know, and it's
it's nice.
&gt;&gt; There's going to be a lot of people
watching this episode, and they're going
to be inspired by how quickly you've
been able to go from NL 200 to winning
the cash game challenge, and I'm sure
they'll be dreaming, fantasizing about
doing the same. What would be some words
of advice you'd give to that player that
would kind of summarize what we spoke
about today? I think the same that I
gave before like be brave, keep trying,
don't give up like it sounds like really
cliche but that's it you know. Yeah,
there's nothing you can say like uh you
you you got to keep doing what you did
to to take you there, you know, and just
do it more intense and more maybe put
more hours, but keep keep focused, be
brave, and yeah, just go for it.
Perfect. Yeah, I think things are cliche
for a reason because they're true.
There's a deep truth to those things.
And for you being brave, obsessing,
always getting better, always taking the
next challenge has been a a real strong
part of your story and how you've got to
where you are. So yeah, it's a great
great last lesson. All right, Pedro. I'd
like to thank you for your time. It's
been an amazing conversation.
Congratulations for holding on and
amazing success in the Cash Game
Championships and yeah, I'm sure we're
going to see a lot more of you in the
future.
&gt;&gt; Thank you, bro. It was a pleasure being
here. An honor. Thank you. Thank you for
the for the invitations.
&gt;&gt; Pedro Beluzin, aka the champ of 2025.
Great conversation. Thank you a lot for
coming on sharing your wisdom. Adam,
what were your main takeaways of today's
conversation?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well that was a mindset
masterclass. So many avenues I can touch
on here. The first one was obsession.
That came up a lot how obsessed he is
with the game, getting better,
improving. I think people sometimes
underestimate like what obsession looks
like, but it's a constant drive to get
better, to improve, to show up. I
picture myself being heads of sitting
and goes and Dan Coleman who was called
Mr. Green at the time. He came on the
scene and he was playing like 12 to 14
hours a day against everyone. He did
like an interview with one of the online
sites and he just said they said, "Oh,
how do you play so much?" He's like,
"There's nothing else in the world I'd
rather do." I was like, "We're all
screwed. We're all screwed cuz this guy
just all he wants to do is play. He's
obsessed." And when someone has that
drive, they show up in in ways that
other people can't match because they're
not doing it because they have to.
They're doing it because this is what
they want to do. This is the thing that
they wake up to do. So for him, he pairs
that with belief. If you look at
throughout his career, he kept telling
himself, "I'm gonna be the champ. I'm
gonna win." and he was telling everyone
in his circle that he was going to come
out on top. This is something that's not
just unique to the challenge. It's a
belief system that he's always
cultivated. He will get to his goals. He
will get the top because if not he just
try again. You'll learn from that and
get better. So a strong belief and I
think anyone listening, think about how
you can work on building your own belief
system in yourself. Not through results,
not through evidence, but also just by
how you show up and not what you think
about yourself. So for him, his belief
was built because he knows he's going to
get better. He knows he'll do whatever
it takes. He knows he'll work hard. So
that over time builds a a kind of belief
system. He also has a a bit of a
lingering doubt that an insecurity that
he's not good enough yet. A bit of a
fear of needing to get better. He still
felt even at the end there that he
wanted to prove something that he's got
to get better. So I think when you pair
that with belief, it allows you to keep
improving, keep getting better. Another
thing I wrote down which came up a lot
was intuition. How that was a kind of
turning point in his career when he
started to trust his intuition more. And
intuition is such a tricky word to speak
on. It's such a tricky topic. We all
know what it is on some level. But it's
that ability to not overthink and trust
your reads, trust your gut, trust your
judgment in the moment. And in a world
of solvers, a world of using data, a
world of where things try to be more
cleancut, intuition seems like that kind
of messy in the middle. It's like, oh,
but but let me like break it down. And
for him, he's learned to trust intuition
more and more of time. And that's been
like his kind of secret weapon. So he's
built up a a kind of repertoire of data
where he can now go in sports,
especially rivers. He says intuition is
what he leans on most frequently. So I
think it's something to uh reflect on
for anyone listening how you currently
use your intuition and where you can
improve your ability to one feel
intuition get in tune with it and then
two go with it and for him he's very big
on always trusting it another thing was
acceptance acceptance perspective these
kind of go hand in hand for me but his
ability just to see things as they are
just to accept things reality as it is
that's just how it is I lost some minds
I lost them no big deal no stories no
narratives no big deal just to be okay
with it and this is like the ultimate
mindset skill when you look at any kind
of mindset skill that you need to learn
whether it's perspective skills, whether
it's reframing, it's all to get to
there. Acceptance. Once you accept, game
over. There's nothing else to do. Your
mind's clear. You can go to the next
thing. So for him, there's so many times
where we try to pinpoint him. We try to
put him on the spot and he just showed
us that he already accepted it. He
showed us that the perspective was just
it is what it is. And from there, that's
get work done for mindset. So I think
for him, he's got a lot of obviously a
lot of things he mentioned learning was
through experience. So one thing I wrote
down as well, experience has been his
biggest teacher. And other people learn
differently. So I think when you're
trying to learn from somebody else, you
got to think about your own learning
style. We we talk about this throughout
the conversation, but he learns a lot
through watching others but from
experience. That's his kind of two
points. So for him, he is live stuff,
does stuff, gets lots of volume and gets
lots of repetition and that's his
learner vehicle. Other people learn more
from observing, through studying,
through learning actual uh frameworks in
more detail. So you've got to think
about for yourself how it applies. But
for him, it was really interesting to
hear how good of a mindset he's been
able to form through experience and
through accepting stuff and developing
these perspectives through through
living them. Read it for yourself. What
are the main things you wrote down?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, when you mentioned intuition and
when he also mentioned in the
conversation, I was always thinking,
yeah, obviously you should listen to
your intuition. You play [ __ ] 200k
hands a month. I'm pretty sure you
picked up on quite a lot of unconscious
information in in the couple years that
you played because you played millions
and millions of hands, right? Um, I
definitely liked what he said in terms
of uh he he kind of broke it down,
right? That he likes to simplify like
that was one part of like the meta
methodology that he still try to
implement in his current game. Like he
tries to simplify flops wherever
possible, right? Save brain power. Then
on the turn again like with the RNGing
like he kind of knows what the range
composition roughly look like. So he bet
the ex x ex x ex x ex x ex x ex x ex x
ex x ex x ex x exit percentage of your
draws, x amount of your top pairs, x
amount of your air. Then he would just
RNG that and then he would use all his
brain power and intuition to kind of
solve the river, right? But it was very
important that basically what that
allows him to do the simplification
RNGing it raises his floor, right? And
we talked about that you can get better
by moving moving your ceiling higher,
right? Raising your aame or by upping
your floor, aka raising your C game and
having the thing that you fall back on
being less bad than before. And what
that allows you to do to have kind of
that floor, it allows actually for more
room for intuition, right? Because you
have less thing to think about. So you
actually your intuition can actually
lead more of your decisions. Um, so I
thought that was uh uh very powerful.
You already mentioned the perspective. I
really love that as well. Uh when we
talk about the challenge, he said I was
like, okay, well, you know, you think
about the [ __ ] I have to play against
the best in the world. But he was like,
well, well, there's also guys who are
not that great, right? And then the same
with the uh with if you if you only
focus on the mistakes that you make, you
feel pretty bad about yourself. But he
said, "Hey, but they were also making
plenty of mistakes." So there were two
good examples and I think he gave
another one um about the perspective
where where I said the worst that can
happen is that I lose money, right?
Where if he does downhill skateboarding
can go really fast. If you make a wrong
move, you could die. So again, all these
perspective skills. Yeah. make
everything. Uh I think I said like what
you focus on is what you feel, right? Um
so yeah, if you if you focus on the
mistakes that other people are making
and how bad other people are, you feel
pretty good about your game and vice
versa. Um a lot of it we actually
chatted a little bit in between as well,
me and Adam, like you have the mindset
theory, but him it was putting
everything in practice, right? And that
was I think a very big part of this
conversation as well. The ability to
take action, that was also the advice
that he said. He said, "Be brave.
Right. Don't be afraid. And then at the
don't be afraid, I kind of asked through
and it's obviously there is fear. Uh I
think there is this uh I don't know if
this is a little definition of courage
but I heard a guy once said that courage
is despite fear moving forward. That's
showing courage, right? So obviously it
feels uncomfortable to lose a lot of
money, right? To put yourself in a
position where you can lose a lot of
money. Uh but he kind of just embraces
that in comfort and he show he's brave.
He shows courage and he does it anyway.
uh he said obviously uh if you feel for
example not confident enough you should
obviously study and work on your game
right to feel confident but you cannot
there's always that uncomfort when you
go out of your comfort zone when you
take a shot etc when you play better
places so there's on one side obviously
you should study to feel more
comfortable but you cannot study that
uncomfort away at some point yeah on the
other side you have to embrace kind of
what you said in the beginning as well
accept you have to accept that that's
just part of it and once you have
accepted it embrace it uh uh yeah you
can move forward I I mean so much good
stuff. Uh for the people who haven't
read read the book obstacles the way he
took 20 shots at 1K&L. Okay. And he
filled 20 times and paired with that
belief that you said in the beginning
right he believed that he was going to
going to become one of the greatest
players and he kept on repeating it.
That allowed him to take action and then
when obstacles hit his way he didn't see
it as oh wait maybe this is not true. He
thought oh there's a lesson here that I
apparently still have to learn. I'm not
mature enough. That's something that he
said quite often as well. So the 20
failed attempts were just 20 lessons
that he had to learn. And then when he
learned those 20 lessons, he now is good
enough to enter the 1K level and and so
on and so on. And then this is actually
a perspective that obstacles the way the
book of Ryan Holidayiday really good
book. Um kind of teaches you. So if
you're interested in that, definitely go
check that out. Um yeah, in general uh
just a lot of great stuff. So, I want to
thank him again for coming off and
again, congratulations for putting on a
great performance during the Cash Game
World Championship uh 2025 edition.
