you try to do that on every hand, you
are going to get [ __ ] you know, it's

[1:45:35]
are going to get [ __ ] you know, it's

[1:45:35]
are going to get [ __ ] you know, it's
really hard to to play a lot of lot of

[1:45:37]
really hard to to play a lot of lot of

[1:45:37]
really hard to to play a lot of lot of
hands and being so sharp on all of your

[1:45:39]
hands and being so sharp on all of your

[1:45:39]
hands and being so sharp on all of your
decisions. So if you can't have a a

[1:45:43]
decisions. So if you can't have a a

[1:45:43]
decisions. So if you can't have a a
strategy that you can simplify and not

strategy that you can simplify and not
lose a lot of V, you know, okay, if I do

[1:45:48]
lose a lot of V, you know, okay, if I do

[1:45:48]
lose a lot of V, you know, okay, if I do
that, I I will be correct. I will maybe

[1:45:52]
that, I I will be correct. I will maybe

[1:45:52]
that, I I will be correct. I will maybe
make a little bit mistakes sometimes,

[1:45:53]
make a little bit mistakes sometimes,

[1:45:53]
make a little bit mistakes sometimes,
but it's not going to be like a a

[1:45:55]
but it's not going to be like a a

[1:45:55]
but it's not going to be like a a
blunder. It's going to be like a

[1:45:58]
blunder. It's going to be like a

[1:45:58]
blunder. It's going to be like a
a frequency mistake. And this it's not

[1:46:01]
a frequency mistake. And this it's not

[1:46:02]
a frequency mistake. And this it's not
going to be a big thing. this uh make

[1:46:05]
going to be a big thing. this uh make

[1:46:05]
going to be a big thing. this uh make
you not not spend a lot of energy, you

[1:46:08]
you not not spend a lot of energy, you

[1:46:08]
you not not spend a lot of energy, you
know, so you you you can be like like

[1:46:12]
know, so you you you can be like like

&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of what I thought like

[1:46:23]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of what I thought like

&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's kind of what I thought like
you you save your energy for more

then it becomes intuitive, right? So you

[1:46:36]
then it becomes intuitive, right? So you

[1:46:36]
then it becomes intuitive, right? So you
don't have to waste that brain power on

don't have to waste that brain power on

[1:46:39]
don't have to waste that brain power on
it. It's more like, okay, I don't

[1:46:40]
it. It's more like, okay, I don't

[1:46:40]
it. It's more like, okay, I don't
clearly don't know the spot. I can now

[1:46:41]
clearly don't know the spot. I can now

They're doing it because this is what

They're doing it because this is what

they wake up to do. So for him, he pairs

[2:19:32]
they wake up to do. So for him, he pairs

they wake up to do. So for him, he pairs
that with belief. If you look at

[2:19:33]
that with belief. If you look at

[2:19:33]
that with belief. If you look at
throughout his career, he kept telling

[2:19:35]
throughout his career, he kept telling

[2:19:35]
throughout his career, he kept telling
himself, "I'm gonna be the champ. I'm

in his circle that he was going to come

out on top. This is something that's not

just unique to the challenge. It's a

[2:19:41]
just unique to the challenge. It's a

try again. You'll learn from that and

not through evidence, but also just by
how you show up and not what you think

[2:19:57]
how you show up and not what you think

[2:19:57]
how you show up and not what you think
about yourself. So for him, his belief

[2:19:59]
about yourself. So for him, his belief

[2:19:59]
about yourself. So for him, his belief
was built because he knows he's going to

[2:20:01]
was built because he knows he's going to

[2:20:01]
was built because he knows he's going to
get better. He knows he'll do whatever

[2:20:02]
get better. He knows he'll do whatever

[2:20:02]

it takes. He knows he'll work hard. So

[2:20:04]
it takes. He knows he'll work hard. So

[2:20:04]
it takes. He knows he'll work hard. So
that over time builds a a kind of belief

[2:20:06]
that over time builds a a kind of belief

[2:20:06]
that over time builds a a kind of belief
system. He also has a a bit of a

he's not good enough yet. A bit of a

[2:20:11]
he's not good enough yet. A bit of a

[2:20:11]
he's not good enough yet. A bit of a
fear of needing to get better. He still

[2:20:12]
fear of needing to get better. He still

[2:20:12]
fear of needing to get better. He still
felt even at the end there that he

[2:20:13]
felt even at the end there that he

[2:20:13]
felt even at the end there that he
wanted to prove something that he's got

[2:20:14]
wanted to prove something that he's got

[2:20:14]
wanted to prove something that he's got
to get better. So I think when you pair

to get better. So I think when you pair

[2:20:16]
to get better. So I think when you pair
that with belief, it allows you to keep
