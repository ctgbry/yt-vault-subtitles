[00:30]
know to bring you more valuable content
like this with that being said let's
dive into today's video in this video
you're gonna learn how poker messes with
your minds now from the outside looking
in poke has a simple strategy game it's
all about numbers computations strategy

[00:45]
all about numbers computations strategy
and who plays the best strategy wins
it's all a simple game like that but
anyone who's played poker for any amount
of time knows there's a lot that goes on
and there's a lot that goes on
internally as you're trying to play this
game myself i haven't played poker for
six years went through a whole host of

[01:02]
six years went through a whole host of
mental problems emotional issues that
came just from playing this card game
now having worked with hundreds of
players around the world i could say
that i was not alone and that most
players if not all players struggle for
their careers to deal with things that

[01:16]
their careers to deal with things that
come from playing poker so it's going to
be a question what's going on like why
do we have so many problems just from
playing a simple card game what is the
root of these problems if you look at
buddhist philosophy they always ask
what's the root what's the root cause

[01:30]
what's the root what's the root cause
rather than the tree or the branches the
external things on the ends what's the
root cause
so it comes to poker you're gonna be
asking the question what is the root
cause and a few days ago i was rereading
the book called the new earth by eckhart
tolle his famous book is the power of
now some of you guys will be familiar

[01:46]
now some of you guys will be familiar
with in this book we covered a concept
which i thought was really good uh to
apply to porka and to share with you
guys today all right so i'm gonna talk
about that concept and then we're gonna
go into some strategies three strategies
we can use in order to best deal with
the poker landscape all right so uh

[02:01]
the poker landscape all right so uh
he talked about uncertainty all right
and he said when we can't handle
uncertainty it causes fear
and that was like a real nail on the
head for me when i thought about pocket
uncertainty is netted into the fabric

[02:16]
uncertainty is netted into the fabric
all right the fabric of poker is all
about uncertainty you could argue that
it's netted into the fabric of life that
we don't really know what's going to
come next there's uncertainty everywhere
but pockets really really compounded all
right it's compounded in three areas
first of all in the short term by short

[02:32]
first of all in the short term by short
term i mean hand to hands flop the flop
run out to run out all right we don't
know what's going to come next are we
going to win are we going to lose we
also don't know in the very short term
is my strategy working
am i good right now am i beating my

[02:46]
am i good right now am i beating my
opponent or is my opponent exploiting me
the data we're getting back in terms of
feedback from results is not accurate it
might as well be flipping coins
basically monkeys pressing keys on
random numbers it's not telling
information did i play my hand correctly
in terms of the optimal strategy or did
i make a mistake we don't know that's

[03:01]
i make a mistake we don't know that's
like in the hand-to-hand moments unless
you have a real strong confidence in
your ability in that moment so we end up
with uncertainty right in the very
moment what's going to happen next am i
going to win am i playing well all right
so that's the first element of
uncertainty we deal with the second

[03:15]
uncertainty we deal with the second
element is what we call midterm like a
mid-term uncertainty and that is am i
going to have a winning session
am i going to make money this week am i
going to make money this month
especially if you're a full-time player
and your
livelihood is poker all right there's a

[03:30]
livelihood is poker all right there's a
lot of pressure to make money and a lot
of us work either in weeks or months all
right some players have a very clear in
their mind i won't have a proper month
other players are more short-term and
they want a profitable day here or a
proper week but we're human we want to
obviously make profits for what we're
doing we want to able to fund our lives

[03:46]
doing we want to able to fund our lives
and support ourselves as well as pursue
things on a high level we want to be
rewarded for our efforts so in the
midterm there's a lot of uncertainty all
my results going to be good this week
this month am i going to be on a bad bit
of a bit of variance i'm going to

[04:00]
of a bit of variance i'm going to
massive downswing and in the in the hole
this month or what am i going to go to
here and have a massive proper month we
don't know so we've got this midterm
property around our results like what's
going to happen all right that leaves
this like feeling of ah i never know
where i'm at financially i never know if
i'm gonna have a comfortable month or
i'm gonna be

[04:15]
i'm gonna be
struggling a bit all right so that's the
second one and the third component is
well i call it the long term uncertainty
and the long term uncertainty is kind of
two avenues one is
am i gonna be good enough to beat these
games in like say a year from now or two
years from now will i have the skill

[04:31]
years from now will i have the skill
level will i have the motivation will i
be able to still be the games as you
guys know poker moves fast the markets
move fast there's so many learning tools
so many stables so many solvers
it feels like everyone's getting better
quick right and sometimes we can almost
trick ourselves into thinking that but

[04:45]
trick ourselves into thinking that but
it is a proven market and everyone's
getting better over time
so you could ask yourself am i going to
keep up will i be able to uh constantly
stay ahead or if i'm not ahead already
will i be able to get ahead over the
next year or so that's the the one long
term concern the second one is will the

[05:00]
term concern the second one is will the
game still be profitable
will the game still be profitable in a
year two years from now so are you
getting better you you control that one
at least to some degree to most of the
degrees the games are profitable
are they going to be who knows who knows
what sites will be available who knows

[05:15]
what sites will be available who knows
what games are available any of you guys
playing live the past few years i've
realized obviously with the pandemic
like how
that needs to be disrupted like
overnight obviously online games can
change like crazy quick with rake back
deals and leaderboards and stuff so
you've got to really

[05:31]
you've got to really
worry in a way of am i going to be able
to make a living from this game long
term so we've got these three
mecha about three kind of different
timestamps of uncertainty very short
term in terms of in the moment the
variance of the decisions you're making
and you're going to win or lose we've

[05:46]
and you're going to win or lose we've
got results in the kind of midterm where
my profitability is going to be am i
going to have money coming in and out
this month then we've got long term is
this going to be a stable career for me
going forwards is the games going to be
there and am i going to be able to beat
them all right so going back to what

[06:00]
them all right so going back to what
eckhart tolle said he said
uncertainty that we can't handle
leads to fear all right so if we can't
handle it so the uncertainty's there all
right unfortunately for you guys
watching this video like the uncertainty
is not going to go away we've got to
sprinkle some magic dust and then

[06:15]
sprinkle some magic dust and then
certainly goes it's there all right so
the fear that we have the internal
conflict that we often have as power
players is rooted in fear and it's fear
that i can't handle
the uncertainty i can't handle the
unknowns i can't handle

[06:31]
unknowns i can't handle
what's gonna happen all right and when
we can't handle it fear is the ego
having a defense mechanism all right so
the ego is our construct that tries to
almost like protect the weak part of
ourselves and it creates a defense
mechanism which is fear all right and
fear is us trying to uh resist what's

[06:47]
fear is us trying to uh resist what's
happening we're trying to go well the
mind basically goes into crazy more
trying to fix the problem if we
theosomic the mind goes oh this is scary
how do we solve it all right but all
that's really happening is you're
resisting
what reality you're resisting what's

[07:00]
what reality you're resisting what's
happening because like i said
uncertainty is
gonna it's there right we can't get rid
of the uncertainty so
it's we're resisting it and the second
thing is we're not
letting the moment pass by all right
we're not surrendering to the moment as
like i could tell would call it all
right so we need to

[07:15]
right so we need to
understand that the reason we're having
problems is because uncertainty is
leading to fear because we can't handle
it all right so if i've done nothing
else in this video i've showed you the
root of your problems is uncertainty you
can say the deeper root is fear all
right so with that as the pretense and

[07:30]
right so with that as the pretense and
with you guys knowing if you think if
you stop and reflect on most of the
problems you have you'll see they're
rooted in these fears they're rooted in
this um uncertainty and you're not gonna
handle uncertainty all right
and as a result we're having problems
all right so uh

[07:45]
all right so uh
now we need something about cable what
can we do all right this is if i can't
change uncertainty how can i best deal
with uncertainty in a better way all
right and in his book the new earth i
can tell talks about three ways for us
to live in a way that allows for

[08:00]
to live in a way that allows for
less uncertainty or not less uncertainty
but it allows us to uh
embrace life all right so allows us to
handle anything any obstacles life
throws away all right so the first thing
the first tool the first approach you
guys can be using in the face of

[08:15]
guys can be using in the face of
uncertainty is
acceptance
all right an acceptance i probably use
this in many many videos it's one of
those core
um kind of mindsets that you need to be
able to install accepting is just about
embracing reality as it is all right so
it's almost like going i don't know but

[08:32]
it's almost like going i don't know but
that's okay it's okay not knowing so for
example in the short term how do you
deal with short term uncertainty through
acceptance you accept that anything can
happen that you're not going to know if
you're going to win or lose each hand
each session you also accept that you're

[08:45]
each session you also accept that you're
not going to know if your strategy is
beating this opponent's strategy if you
played yourself you're kind of 100 right
so you've got to embrace embrace the
fact that wait a second
i don't know everything and i'm okay
with that i don't know how things gonna
go oh it feels a bit scary but i'm okay

[09:00]
go oh it feels a bit scary but i'm okay
with that it's just kind of
plain on the edges where you're like i
don't know i don't like that feeling but
i'm gonna learn to be okay with that and
what happens when you can't if you can't
be okay with that the mind goes ugh i
don't like this i need to fix it all
right that's when the fear starts you

[09:16]
right that's when the fear starts you
start running around anxiety starts
stress starts all all the kind of
mindset issues that evolve because you
couldn't accept what happens all right
so it's accepting the unknowns
and embracing it it's a feeling right so
what i've learned in my life is embrace

[09:31]
what i've learned in my life is embrace
the feeling of not knowing all right so
uncertainty is like i do not know what's
gonna happen the mind goes we can't have
uncertainty that solve that problem
trying to protect the ego
but
you can in turn to go i don't know
and i'm okay not knowing all right it's

[09:45]
and i'm okay not knowing all right it's
first that might seem to a bit of an
alien feeling to some of you guys and be
like how could i feel comfortable not
knowing because your mind is so active
in those moments but you just sit still
you said still the fact i don't know but
i'm okay not knowing
you can get us this stillness all right

[10:00]
you can get us this stillness all right
that's that's the level of acceptance
all right so first of all play around
with the level of acceptance and try
to just ask yourself why can't i accept
this or ask can i accept this moment can
i accept that i've lost can i accept no
no one if your soon says yes as soon as
you take that box of acceptance

[10:16]
you take that box of acceptance
it lowers that fear all right and the
lowest intensity all right the second
thing we can do to kind of counter
uncertainty is learn to cultivate
enjoyment all right now echotal talks
about enjoyment being

[10:30]
about enjoyment being
in the moment all right so rather like
being like something we get is the end
result it being in the present moment
being fully immersed in what you're
doing is what brings enjoyment all right
and i can picture this in many parts of
my own life when i'm fully engaged when
i'm fully involved in what i'm doing it

[10:46]
i'm fully involved in what i'm doing it
brings enjoyment all right so uh all the
uncertainty and all the doubts of the
minds go away when you fully
get immersed in what you're doing all
right so when you're playing poker if
you're fully playing poker and you're
fully in the game in the strategy trying
to think about stuff trying to play the

[11:00]
to think about stuff trying to play the
highest level in in that flow-like state
it almost doesn't matter what's
happening results-wise because the
experience itself is taking up your
consciousness and as a result it brings
enjoyment all right even if you're
struggling with results-wise same way
you're studying you're trying to learn
you're trying to prove if you're fully

[11:15]
you're trying to prove if you're fully
in but most in the moment that's going
to bring this enjoyment all right so
anytime you're feeling that you're
you're basically feeling overwhelmed you
feel any fears
channel that your attention into
something all right go fully into the
moment whatever moments in front of you

[11:31]
moment whatever moments in front of you
if you're playing pokemon double down on
your focus and really zoom in if you're
doing something else double down all
right and when you're in the present
moments guess what
vs can't live there it's one of those
like weird things that need to
remind yourself like a hundred thousand

[11:45]
remind yourself like a hundred thousand
a million times there is no fear in the
moment
there's no fear in the moment yes in the
future think about the future say it it
fears in the past fears when you're in
your mind your consciousness is in your
mind
and it's not in the present moment if
your consciousness is in the present
moment

[12:00]
moment
there's no fear there's just the moment
it's just the moment that you're
experiencing all right give it your all
what you find is when you can do that
more often the more time you find in the
present moment the more time you spend
the present moment the better you
perform in everything whether it's
pokemon whether it's tennis whether it's
relationships whether it's learning well

[12:16]
relationships whether it's learning well
that's anything you perform better when
you're there you're surprised right when
you're present in the moment when your
consciousness is there all right once
you realize that all right i should
train my mind to have my attention in
the moment and know my thoughts i always

[12:30]
the moment and know my thoughts i always
bring it into the moment all right so
that's the second one bringing enjoyment
to what you do
and the third one which he talks about
is
enthusiasm bring enthusiasm to what you
do now enthusiasm is very similar to
enjoyment but it's enjoyment in the
moment it's been very present in the

[12:45]
moment it's been very present in the
moment but then there's a an added thing
he puts on the ends which is you're
moving towards a goal a purpose an
objective all right so it's like
enjoyment it's like pursuing the moment
with an end goal in mind all right and
ideally those end goals you want to have

[13:00]
ideally those end goals you want to have
them that are uplifting fulfilling to
you and often they involve other people
like you're trying to uh become a better
version of yourself say as a poker
player so you can make money so you can
have a better life for you and your
family as soon as you extend your
awareness your thoughts your ideas past
yourself in your own individual

[13:16]
yourself in your own individual
situation it creates more enthusiasm all
right so enthusiasm have a purpose the
ultimate enthusiasm is to feel like the
actions you're taking are on a purpose
towards a very very meaningful objective
for yourself right so cultivate
enthusiasm we can do it on the big scale

[13:32]
enthusiasm we can do it on the big scale
and have like this kind of life vision i
also have a vision board that we're
working towards an ideal version of
ourself and life that we're pushing
towards that's one way you can cultivate
which i think everyone should be working
towards and then you've got the
day-to-day enthusiasm because this
session this moment this hand this study

[13:47]
session this moment this hand this study
session is moving me towards my goals
all right so it's like having the bigger
picture and in the short term and
realizing
i'm doing this for a reason and the
bigger the reason the more enthusiastic
you'll be all right this sparks the
brain to pay attention

[14:01]
brain to pay attention
so uh acceptance is almost like the prop
the things happened and i deal with it
so the first thing you learned was
acceptance that's almost like [ __ ]
happens now what all right [ __ ] is going
to happen now what all right being able
to deal with those things
enjoyment is the ability to actually

[14:15]
enjoyment is the ability to actually
almost protect yourself from the mind
going to those places because you're so
amazed at what you're doing that's those
the feelings of enjoyment come and you
haven't got time for the mind to be
fearful or uncertain one of one of the
cures for fear is to immerse yourself
what you're doing all right to make

[14:30]
what you're doing all right to make
yourself in the activity you do it and
enthusiasm just has the same kind of
mechanisms it's basically you're so
immersed in what you're doing you don't
have time to be uncertain you don't have
time to fear because you're
enthusiastically pursuing what you're
doing all right so you link those three

[14:46]
doing all right so you link those three
together acceptance enjoyment and
enthusiasm
that's the magic all right that's when
you can really uh stop uncertainty you
can stop fear you can stop anxiety
stress because one of those three things
you're not doing all right if you could
look at it

[15:00]
look at it
situations all you can do is accept it
all right let's say you're a downswing
the best thing you can probably do there
is accept it let's say you're in a poker
session and
think you're trying to certainly focus
and you get the knowledge things aren't
going your way you can accept that
things aren't going your way or you can
start enjoying it more by being more

[15:15]
start enjoying it more by being more
present or you can turn on enthusiasm by
linking what you're doing to your bigger
outcomes all right so we've got
different tools that we can use for
different situations but as a poker
player like i've talked about throughout
this uncertainty is your obstacle
uncertainty at least the fear is the
root of all your problems right it's the

[15:30]
root of all your problems right it's the
root of everything so hopefully you've
learned about why you have problems as a
supporting player but also you've got
three tools now to experiment with so as
you go away from this video or when you
go into your lives and when you start
using these three tools and when you
start using them in different situations

[15:45]
start using them in different situations
and see how effective they are see if
they stop that feeling of fear
uncertainty see if they deactivate the
mind a little bit and get you more
present and more engaged in what you're
doing if they do amazing keep doing them
and your life becomes better and you're
able to manage the program environments
in a much better way all right guys hope

[16:00]
in a much better way all right guys hope
