joining the pot

happy to be here excited yeah I messaged

too quite some convincing but very happy
that you decided to come on I'm sure our
audience will really appreciate it as

[04:00]
audience will really appreciate it as
well Barrick when uh we asked you what
got you into poker you actually
mentioned it was because you were a bit
of a Degen
and that got me to think how does the
start of a degenerate poker player
career look like
okay so yes I was quite a teacher

[04:19]
okay so yes I was quite a teacher
um
my friends can probably approve that
um
so I think I started playing poker when
I was like 13 or 14 actually for play

[04:30]
I was like 13 or 14 actually for play
money my cousin who at the time was a
very good friend of mine uh basically
introduced me to the game and we would
play on Facebook
and I think even on Facebook I was like
a big DJ I would like uh break my

[04:45]
a big DJ I would like uh break my
bankroll like every day basically play
uh until I bust or whatever until you
get the extra chips on the next day and
then around the age of like 17
um maybe 17 18 I I figure out

[05:02]
um maybe 17 18 I I figure out
or you can actually play for money so I
I I started playing on poker stars and I
was quite bad but I had an illusion that
I'm good because you know you win like a

[05:15]
I'm good because you know you win like a
small tournament and then you think like
oh I'm so [ __ ] good in this game but
then you quickly realize that you're not
um and I think after depositing like 50
to 100 dollars like probably 10 to 20
times

[05:30]
times
um I realized like oh there's probably
um like there's probably some skill to
this game like like there must be
something going on over here
um and back at the time there was like a
forum in Israel called the poker land

[05:47]
forum in Israel called the poker land
um and it was very popular and a lot of
the best Israeli Pros leader actually
talking about strategy over there which
was kind of insane if you think about it
um because it was basically a very good

[06:00]
um because it was basically a very good
content in Hebrew
and yeah like I remember just reading a
lot about everything like cash games uh
entities uh yeah just surfing through
the forums and uh yeah seeing what's

[06:16]
the forums and uh yeah seeing what's
going on and then there would be like
some guys who would sell action
uh for like Sunday sessions over there
and I would just uh you had this feature
this cool feature you you can look up
names on PokerStars and see like if they

[06:30]
names on PokerStars and see like if they
have any deep runs so I would just open
like some of the best pros and like
watch them uh as they play uh I remember
it was very cool I even bought action
for like three percent five percent
sometimes uh in my uh yeah it was like a

[06:45]
sometimes uh in my uh yeah it was like a
pretty big amount uh back then but I
still did it
um I said at least that's that's like
profitable probably
and yeah it was uh basically what
happened is when I started playing for
money
um I actually started uh taking some

[07:01]
um I actually started uh taking some
coaching from a guy in that form uh and
after a few sessions I was already
winning the sit and go player
um so
I was doing very well even though I was
probably a fish but I still had like a

[07:16]
probably a fish but I still had like a
decent clue about uh open jamming and
re-jamming and whatever and some ICM and
that was enough to beat like the low
stakes back then and then at some point
it was like

[07:30]
it was like
uh
I I just realized that every time what
happens is I I keep busting my bankroll
because I'm let's say I'm having like a
losing week then I just want to play
bigger so let's say my average buying
was like eight dollars at the time then

[07:46]
was like eight dollars at the time then
I would suddenly play like uh I don't
know like I had 1K in my account and I
would play like a 200 hyper sit and go
um yeah so I I I assume the direct the
wrecks back then they liked me because I

[08:01]
wrecks back then they liked me because I
I would often uh bust my bankroll in
those hypers
um very quickly
um so yeah that's basically uh how it
started for me like
um I would play

[08:16]
um I would play
pretty well in in my Stakes but then I
would just do something stupid to bust
my bankroll
um and to be honest I think uh this
brings like a deeper concept of uh poker

[08:30]
brings like a deeper concept of uh poker
players especially poker players who
come from an MTT background like I've
I've been here to both of the worlds
like mpts and cash games now and I think
there is some different uh in the
characters of MTT players and cash games
like not all of them but

[08:47]
like not all of them but
um like I think MTT they have the they
have like this uh self-destruct deep
inside them I don't know how to like
everyone has it in a different amount of
power I guess and and something else

[09:00]
power I guess and and something else
triggers it for them but
um it seems like the cash game players
are usually more like in their character
more solid people and like nitier with
with management and everything and then
MTT guys they want to play bigger they
want to take the shots they yeah they

[09:17]
want to take the shots they yeah they
wanna again like definitely you can talk
about everyone but it's just the way I
see it and the way I see my friends are
and and people that I know of and
then I think uh yeah I just think uh I I

[09:34]
then I think uh yeah I just think uh I I
definitely had this self-destruct mode
deep inside me
um I'm not entirely sure where it came
from and and exactly uh
why it happened and when it happened but

[09:47]
why it happened and when it happened but
I assume it was
yeah it was just there and and it would
often just come up
um
and I really needed to like lose my
bankroll a lot of times like uh my
friend uh likes to say that every poker

[10:02]
friend uh likes to say that every poker
player needs to lose uh to go bust at
least at least once so I think I went
pastor at least like 15 to 20 times the
the thing is
um all of those times came at a really

[10:15]
um all of those times came at a really
young age and I wasn't even a pro back
then I wasn't making a living of the
game I was basically uh just before the
the Army and then during the Army I was
also playing uh in Israel you have to do
three years of military service it's

[10:32]
three years of military service it's
mandatory so I was doing my service
and then yeah then
basically
um
after my military service I knew already
that I want to go pro like I want to do

[10:47]
that I want to go pro like I want to do
this for a living
um I've had poker friends from
from study groups like from before the
Army and I would talk to them often we
we've become good friends by now and
they already all made a lot of progress

[11:01]
they already all made a lot of progress
since the day we were playing like low
sticks and I really couldn't because I
was basically in the military and then
yeah then uh just uh I just started I
basically told my parents that like uh

[11:17]
basically told my parents that like uh
like a few days after I I got off the
military that I'm gonna do this for a
living like I'm gonna go all in with it
like there is no other way and we've
already had a lot of fights about poker
because they definitely didn't like the
idea and also I think they they didn't

[11:31]
idea and also I think they they didn't
know exactly but I think they realized
that I was doing some stupid [ __ ] like
going Buster and stuff because just by
the way I was behaving and everything
and then uh basically my dad I remember

[11:45]
and then uh basically my dad I remember
he told me my friends are awesome and
they've been really supported uh really
supportive my entire life about every
about most decisions I made that aren't
stupid of course
um but back then they were like
um yeah like my dad told me like listen

[12:02]
um yeah like my dad told me like listen
if you if you want to go travel if you
want to do whatever you can do whatever
but if you if you wanna uh Gamble for a
living then I'm not gonna let you do
that at least not in my house so I
basically left uh you you could say left

[12:17]
basically left uh you you could say left
but I I I I I was kind of kicked out of
my house uh when I was when I was 22.
um and I didn't have much money but I
probably had enough to pay rent for like

[12:30]
probably had enough to pay rent for like
an expenses for like one year
so basically what I did was uh uh
basically decided that like this is what
I'm gonna do I'm just gonna go all in
with it and there is no other choice
like this is what I want to do this is
what I wanna I was super obsessed with

[12:45]
what I wanna I was super obsessed with
the game uh and everything that involves
the game like starting talking about
every spot super deeply even before like
I'm talking like this is not super long
ago it's only like five years and a half
years ago they probably had some solvers

[13:01]
years ago they probably had some solvers
already but I was not introduced to them
um and yeah this is basically how it
starts like I just started uh
started playing uh
um
entities like online live and figuring

[13:17]
entities like online live and figuring
out if I if I can do this and I was
basically of course I've had some
setbacks but I've I've been pretty
successful ever since
Yeah you mentioned that because of your
degenerate Tendencies you got into touch

[13:30]
degenerate Tendencies you got into touch
with poker but you also mentioned after
that you stayed more For the Love of the
Game but still also kind of the
adrenaline that poker can give you right
and actually what you mentioned about
entity players I can imagine just the
format MTT just you know you always have
the dream of the you know the big money

[13:46]
the dream of the you know the big money
the big money score so I think naturally
it draws maybe people and who are a bit
more gambly like oh yeah but I can win
very big today you know whereas Cascade
players are more like steady Eddie you
know every day so I I

[14:00]
survey amongst poker players and kind of
see what personality traits are
different in in different foods imagine
like hyper hyper system goes these
people are probably even more degenerate
um you still have some of that
dejin or at least that chase for

[14:16]
dejin or at least that chase for
adrenaline you play a lot of
short-handed three four-handed against
some of the best players in the world is
that still a bit that decent inside of
you looking for that Russian adrenaline
or is that mainly the Love of the Game
and competing against the best

[14:31]
um
I think it's uh it's probably again I
I've done a lot of work on this uh like
I've done a lot of work on mental game
in general but uh or like mental for

[14:45]
in general but uh or like mental for
life as well I think
um and
I think there is always going to be a
little part of me that is Degen but I
think one of my best strengths is that
I'm very self-aware so if I'm tilted I'm

[15:01]
I'm very self-aware so if I'm tilted I'm
aware of it if I'm feeling certain
emotions
I'm aware of it it doesn't always mean
that I can control it or do something
about it but I'm very aware of aware of
the situation and
I think if I choose to play a certain

[15:16]
I think if I choose to play a certain
game
sometimes there are lineups where I'm
probably at best gonna be Break Even or
maybe slightly winning or slightly
losing
um but most of the time I think it's

[15:31]
um but most of the time I think it's
gonna be
um
if I if I play a certainly in a certain
game I think it's probably gonna mean
that I'm that I think I'm gonna win at
it because
um
I have this thing uh that I am I'm a

[15:47]
I have this thing uh that I am I'm a
very intuitive person and I think uh
intuitive person
means that like intuitive people are
usually people who like they see
something something happening and then

[16:01]
something something happening and then
there is a result and
after a lot of times that these things
happen
um they they kind of get the intuition
of like one thing leads to another so if
I'm playing a game and I see that I'm

[16:15]
I'm playing a game and I see that I'm
getting [ __ ] every time then I'm
probably uh at some point gonna realize
that it's probably not very good for me
um so
there would be certain games that I
would avoid
um like heads up against certain players

[16:31]
um like heads up against certain players
for example and then they would be even
though I haven't done a lot of heads up
study I think uh the game is super
Dynamic and there could be some
opponents that I can beat even if they
have done more starting than me
um but then I would there would be like

[16:46]
um but then I would there would be like
some guys and I would just see that like
consistently there's just no way I can
beat this guy and I will just not do it
um so I think to answer your question
it's uh it has to do a lot with the Love

[17:00]
it's uh it has to do a lot with the Love
of the Game and just uh when the stakes
are very high like you mentioned me
playing uh like three 400 with very good
players so yeah when when you can play
nowadays like 20 KNL with low rake with
uh with the best players I'm definitely

[17:16]
uh with the best players I'm definitely
down for it
um
yeah there is just the Love of the Game
that dwell on it but I also like I just
look at my results consistently and
obviously if I'm getting crushed I'm not
gonna keep playing that game but you
also mentioned if you have a good Intuit

[17:31]
also mentioned if you have a good Intuit
like you kind of feel right when when
you get even though the result might
show something different you do feel if
you're winning or not you feel if you're
in control you feel if the things that
you think will happen will actually also
happen you know if you have like a

[17:45]
happen you know if you have like a
certain game plan going in but every
time other things happen you're like
wait wait maybe I'm missing something
but if things kind of go the way you
expect them to go the players play the
way you expect it to play you feel more
in control you feel more confident this
way because and also I also ask you

[18:00]
way because and also I also ask you
because sometimes people ask me the
question then they show like why why are
these guys playing against each other
right and again well they probably first
of all they're all competitive people
right they all love to compete but most
probably if you ask anyone everyone will
say the same like and this is this is so

[18:15]
say the same like and this is this is so
nice about poker right everyone will
probably say well I think I'm at maybe
I'm Break Even but probably I'm a winner
and everyone says that a winner that's
so nice
yeah I think I think it's uh it's a it's
a very good question like a friend asked
me like

[18:30]
me like
I'm I'm actually not uh
uh quite the the butler guy like there
would be guy who bought it a lot more
than me I just started doing it recently
more
um but
I think it's like uh if you asked anyone

[18:46]
I think it's like uh if you asked anyone
in that field he's probably gonna say
he's winning or like break even in which
doesn't make sense unless everybody is
exactly break even
um but I think there are a few things
that lead us to play those games I guess

[19:01]
that lead us to play those games I guess
one of them is just when you play the
higher Stakes
um
so there would be like 5K games running
probably every day but then when you go
to 10K 20K 40K they would not always be

[19:15]
to 10K 20K 40K they would not always be
good action like now there is good
action but there would be like weeks
sometimes months with no extra no action
and then some of the guys who already
don't play 5K
um they basically have no action and
they want to they want to practice you

[19:30]
they want to they want to practice you
can call it they want to play they want
to be in good shape uh and also they
love the game and also when you have no
action and you're just open sitting like
empty tables all day with nothing to do
then

[19:46]
then
it's nice to sometimes have like one two
hours of action even and then sometimes
like a recreational could jump in and
play and join the game or whatever and
these things actually happen like
sometimes so
I think it's uh as long as it's a low

[20:01]
I think it's uh as long as it's a low
rake environment I think it's probably
for most of the players in that game is
probably sustainable and yeah like
they're probably like break even you
know like uh slightly winning or
whatever
um and yeah it's it's a lot it's also

[20:18]
um and yeah it's it's a lot it's also
very cool it's very Dynamic like you get
the best players in the world but uh you
would expect maybe one would expect that
they are gonna just be like robots
playing uh perfect Theory against each

[20:32]
playing uh perfect Theory against each
other but I think it's far from that and
there is a lot more to it and it's it's
a lot of fun it's very cool
um like you said it's it it's like the
most adrenaline you can get that it's
the best

[20:45]
the best
yeah for sure I think especially you
know what I personally like uh from
three-handed player would say that's
probably probably my favorite because
like when the other positions come in
there's just so many
Equity setups that you're a bit
handcuffed like the equities of the

[21:00]
handcuffed like the equities of the
range is a kind of handcuff you and what
you can do or not but when you play
three-handed this there's way less spots
where the equity is so much in one's
favorite so you can always just you
there's just way more room to play
around so to speak
yeah yeah I agree

[21:15]
yeah yeah I agree
so nowadays as you mentioned most of
your volume comes from cash games but
you did start out playing entities why
did you decide to play entities in the
beginning and what made you decide to
think it was you mentioned the 2021
switch to cash games

[21:30]
switch to cash games
so yeah going back to that one year
after the Army I was playing mtps
because that's basically what I knew
about I was playing some cash games here
and there but I wasn't any good at it

[21:45]
and there but I wasn't any good at it
um and then basically my uh First Cash
games experience as like a pro were like
traveling to like Cyprus or like Vegas
or whatever
and or like Europe and just you're

[22:01]
and or like Europe and just you're
playing like a tournament series and
then you would have days where you just
passed early or like a day with no
tournament and you want to make some
money so you just go and sit down to
play a cash game and usually those games

[22:15]
play a cash game and usually those games
are pretty soft and
um
one could say they actually have you you
can make more money per hour in those
games which I agree and it's also much
more stable and I always had like
friends who play cash so I would just

[22:32]
friends who play cash so I would just
play for a few hours discuss some hands
with them uh see the differences and all
of that but I was basically focusing on
mtts and I've been pretty successful
and then uh basically after that year I

[22:48]
and then uh basically after that year I
I realized that okay like this is going
well I can do that uh and then I decided
to go to Vegas for the first time
and that was a big uh very big climb for
me because the basically a good friend

[23:02]
me because the basically a good friend
of mine told me listen it's uh like
everybody was telling me listen Vegas is
rough like you want to be very careful
with the first time you should go for
like two three weeks just to experience
play the main whatever and be very

[23:16]
play the main whatever and be very
careful and
I was like
yeah I don't know maybe I should like a
friend of mine who is playing cash games
told me he's going for three months and
he was a very good friend of mine and he
told me listen let's let's do this let's

[23:31]
told me listen let's let's do this let's
go for three months you're gonna play
cash games uh for like uh 30 days or
like 35 days and then WSOP starts you
just grind the tournaments do your thing
and you can earn like money stably by

[23:45]
and you can earn like money stably by
playing like for 30 days and then worst
case scenario you're not gonna go broke
like you're gonna lose uh a decent
amount in mtps but you you can win like
a bunch before that so I I thought the
idea was cool
so I went for it and it was pretty funny

[24:01]
so I went for it and it was pretty funny
because on my second day uh there was
like some uh spring series or whatever
going on at the win and I actually
managed to win a 400 tournament for like
30k which at the time I think was my

[24:15]
30k which at the time I think was my
biggest win
um or something uh around my biggest win
uh and it was my first live win and I I
think this was it was maybe one of the
happiest moments of my life probably
like winning my first live Trophy and it

[24:30]
like winning my first live Trophy and it
was it was followed by a month of just
bringing break even in cash so my plan
didn't didn't go my plan of like making
a bunch of money and cash games didn't
go well uh and then the series came and
I was basically running super hot I

[24:46]
I was basically running super hot I
think I was super confident and playing
uh well especially like at least uh
I think I was playing well I don't know
uh maybe I was I was still not very good
back then but uh relatively to what I

[25:00]
back then but uh relatively to what I
was playing I think I was pretty good
and I've actually won like four
tournaments that summer which was kind
of insane yeah it was like the 400 at
the me at the win for like
30k followed by like a 600 definition
for like 40K

[25:16]
for like 40K
uh one kid definition for like 100k and
then uh the tech team uh event uh for
wall for WSOP bracelet with two of my
good friends which was also very very

[25:30]
good friends which was also very very
cool uh very nice and I even had like
the biggest Final Table of my life back
then at least until that moment it was
like uh
1.6 K event at the win uh with like 500k
for first and I got uh like I got it in

[25:47]
for first and I got uh like I got it in
like Ace Jack stood it against Ace 4
student or something and busted ninth
and I remember like this was a big uh a
big moment in my mental career because I
remember like basically what happens in
empty teeth I think is most people they

[26:02]
empty teeth I think is most people they
run deep and then they have uh like
let's say you're like one out of 20 in a
big tournament and then you have like
this huge expectation you're already
dreaming of like ah like there is like
100k 200k 1 million up top doesn't

[26:16]
100k 200k 1 million up top doesn't
matter and you have that amount in your
mind already you're thinking about it
some it may affect their game some it
doesn't but I think as long as you have
that expectation and then realistically
you can just bust two hours after that
or like three hands later

[26:32]
or like three hands later
um that can be really really painful and
I remember like that uh Final Table even
though it was followed by basically
Mingo going to Vegas and 10xing my
bankroll or something during the trip
um I still I was so disappointed like I

[26:48]
um I still I was so disappointed like I
remember I basically became sick it was
like the last day of my Vegas trip and I
I had to like back and uh do all those
kinds of arrangements before my flight
and I remember I was just lying sick in

[27:01]
and I remember I was just lying sick in
bed just couldn't get up and maybe I was
just getting the flu but I think it had
also something to do with just being
really really disappointment like even
though it was like still a great result
I think it was like 50k from a 1.6 K

[27:17]
I think it was like 50k from a 1.6 K
tournament but at the moment you just
feel like somebody
trust your soul I don't know
um
thought this was a very very big
experience for me because ever since
I've been really really careful with
having expectations I think ever since

[27:31]
having expectations I think ever since
basically it's never happened like I've
had so many different uh like I remember
being like one out of 10 in a big live
MPT with like 40 of chips and busting
knives and not even like bunting just
getting cooler

[27:45]
getting cooler
um and I was so okay with it like I was
always obviously disappointed but like
now I just realize these things happen
and it's just a part of the experience
and there is not much you can do about
it also going back to what I said before
I think MTT guys they need to you know

[28:00]
I think MTT guys they need to you know
they need to acknowledge the pain like
there is so much pain to it so let's say
you sit down and you play a cash game
and let's say a cash game guy is having
a downswing losing like 30 binds 50
bands I don't know it can be pretty
painful I'm not saying you're not going

[28:15]
painful I'm not saying you're not going
to have rough moments but if you're an
MTT guy and you're losing 500 buyings or
like you're losing for like one or two
years this is like this is very painful
and this is one of the reasons why I
left mpts

[28:31]
left mpts
um so basically what happened is
uh back then I was thinking I want to
play mostly live because I felt like
live entities are so good and I like
like going traveling to many stops

[28:47]
like going traveling to many stops
um and I was doing really well basically
I I after that Vegas trip I went to
Cyprus there is a cool place called
Merit and I won the main event basically
back to back like two trips in a row for

[29:00]
back to back like two trips in a row for
like 160 180k each which is again like
kind of insane an insane run
um and yeah basically then covet happens
um no more live stops so I was kind of

[29:17]
um no more live stops so I was kind of
not sure what to do but then online
poker boom
so I was again playing online entities
and was doing okay
I think I have a I had a solid year at
covid but then uh

[29:31]
covid but then uh
I realized like this is not working like
I don't enjoy the online streets as much
anymore
uh
especially when it means uh
uh I mean the online entity streets
especially when it means going to sleep

[29:46]
especially when it means going to sleep
like with my Israeli time zone it means
like you have to go to sleep at like
five six seven eight a.m every day if
you want to grind it and for me it was
not sustainable because it basically
would [ __ ] my life
um I was trying to get like a routine

[30:01]
um I was trying to get like a routine
going of like just living like I'm not
saying like waking up 6 a.m but at least
you know waking up like 11 A.M like 12
something like that and being able to uh
to have a social life being able to I
don't know

[30:15]
don't know
um doing some stuff other than starting
and playing and it was very hard so I
was thinking maybe I could uh maybe I
could try something else maybe I can try
to get into Cash games
and then a mutual friend connected me to

[30:35]
and then a mutual friend connected me to
repellent
uh which you've already talked to and
basically
um
him and a great group of coaches

[30:48]
him and a great group of coaches
shifted my game from playing I wasn't
really a beginner because I started
playing like I already had a lot of
money and experience and I
basically started playing like 1K when I

[31:00]
basically started playing like 1K when I
moved to cash games like 5-10
and I was doing already pretty well
um playing those games and
then what happens is my game just
shifted really quickly from playing
those games to like playing like taking

[31:17]
those games to like playing like taking
a shot at 5K on GG and then having taken
a shot at 5K and seeing that things are
going well for one two three months I
said okay I mean usually what happens in
ice takes is there is a big gap between

[31:31]
ice takes is there is a big gap between
the mid Stakes to high stakes so if you
play 5 10 or 10 20 it's really hard to
go up to play 5K
because what happens is there are first
of all there is a lot less action in
2550 compared to like 510 and second the

[31:47]
2550 compared to like 510 and second the
games are much tougher
um also because there is a lot less
action than people play fewer tables
they are much more focused whereas if
you play five ten people maybe they play
especially on GG but they could play

[32:01]
especially on GG but they could play
like 10 to 15 tables or something to
grind the rakeback stuff or whatever and
I think it's it's much tougher to play
the higher game and
then this Gap is really hard to uh to go

[32:16]
then this Gap is really hard to uh to go
through and for me I don't know it kind
of I've always been on the side of like
I said DJ but yeah like
at that point I'm already taking like uh
smart shot taking I I would say because

[32:30]
smart shot taking I I would say because
I had a lot of money from mtks I I I
just wasn't sure that I have the skill
that is required but once I figure out
that I do then basically when you play
the high stakes then often 2550 and 5100

[32:45]
the high stakes then often 2550 and 5100
it's almost the same lineup so you just
then I started playing 5100 and I
basically saw that my results were even
better because it's the same lineup but
uh The Rake is lower and then there
would be like a 100 200 game uh so

[33:00]
would be like a 100 200 game uh so
whenever there was a really good spot I
started playing those games and
then I realized that again like the
results just get better because often
it's it's like a very similar lineup but
it's uh it's much lower rate

[33:15]
it's uh it's much lower rate
um and I guess 100 200 is exactly the
cutoff point where the games become
start to become much tougher because
some of the guys who play 5K regularly
don't want to play
but people who like the the very top

[33:30]
but people who like the the very top
guys they do want to play so like if
they see there is some 20K or 40K action
going on regularly they would just show
up uh they would they would start
showing up every day which doesn't
always happen
um so yeah and then it picked that uh it

[33:46]
um so yeah and then it picked that uh it
pays I've had like a really good year
and it peaked with like the Imagine King
games at the end of 2021 basically uh if
yeah I'll just say it's like some kind
of Chinese guy who showed up and he

[34:01]
of Chinese guy who showed up and he
started playing uh 2550 like free tables
and then he moved up to 5100 and then
100 200 200 400 I think he even played
like one or two sessions of higher than
that but most of the games were like uh
20K and 40K

[34:16]
20K and 40K
um uh when it was 40K it was basically
really tough lineups basically uh the
same guys almost show up every day uh
you could see like Kevin Linus
um

[34:30]
um
uh Ignacio 2D
um
yeah like David Jones Daryl like
literally all of the all of the very top
guys they would just show up every day
like Marcus like on them
um there would be like uh

[34:46]
um there would be like uh
yeah it would be like uh six table with
almost uh the same lineup
um and then it was very it was very nice
because even though we had this wreck at
the table it was still very hard because

[35:02]
the table it was still very hard because
the rake is still uh it's it's already
much lower but it's still if you compare
it to different sides it was still
pretty high
um and you're playing like literally the
best players in the world so

[35:15]
best players in the world so
I I actually I I think I also ran pretty
hot during that like one two months but
I think I was uh probably at the top of
my game of my game back then just being
really really sharp uh studying and
being very consistent and I also I think

[35:31]
being very consistent and I also I think
I've had like a really good routine uh
during that times so yeah I was super
happy
um to be able to yeah to do that
well it's a it's a very impressive story

[35:45]
well it's a it's a very impressive story
Adam I'm sure uh you have some questions
from Mr Barrack sadly uh listening on
the sideline
yeah I'm super curious to uh map out how
you went from this degenerate Gambler
sort of spewing off buy-ins going broke
starting out to this really calm

[36:01]
starting out to this really calm
calculated uh high stakes guy we say
today so you mentions that you went
broke like 15 20 times start now it's
the first question that comes to mind is
how were you uh funding yourself to keep
Rebellion but also um what was going

[36:17]
Rebellion but also um what was going
through your mind as you were continuing
to take shots and fail a poke up early
on can you remember some of the thought
process you were having
so
it's quite interesting because
I was a completely different person I

[36:31]
I was a completely different person I
think I was like 17 18 years old
it was probably like for like a few
years that it happened those things
um and I was basically
uh very emotional I guess I would just

[36:45]
uh very emotional I guess I would just
have a lot of emotions going on and
not
super aware of some of them
I was still a very uh self-aware person
in general but I think I I just didn't
know some of those things happen
um I didn't realize they were happening

[37:00]
um I didn't realize they were happening
and
I just I was super obsessed with the
game like I I think at first it was just
like the gambling part and maybe some
part of me deep inside I just need I
think we all sometimes we we need to

[37:16]
think we all sometimes we we need to
lose uh I don't know how to explain it
exactly but
um there is there is this against
self-destruct uh system in in all of us
but I just think some people it's very
minor for them and some people it's it's
really large

[37:31]
really large
um so for me I think back then it was
really large
um not really sure why
and then basically what happens is uh I
was lucky because back then I was
playing really small so if I was busting
like a one two 5K bankroll it's not a

[37:46]
like a one two 5K bankroll it's not a
big deal whereas let's say today like
you bust like I don't know like let's
say someone who's playing midstick so
like like ice takes and it busts like a
500K roll I don't know how you can
recover from that
um it's gonna be really really really
tough

[38:01]
tough
um and yeah I was just a kid I think I
was a kid physically and mentally and
luckily for me I had really really uh
had some close friends who are really
really
needy and they really uh cared about me

[38:18]
needy and they really uh cared about me
and I remember having a lot of
conversation with them about like uh you
can't do this like this is not like
how it's supposed to go like maybe this
is not for you

[38:30]
is not for you
um they actually they really actually
cared about me which was very good uh
whereas I think some other people they
could be in different environments uh
and I could be led to a diff to an
entirely for a lifetime uh let's say I
don't know I had a friend who told me

[38:46]
don't know I had a friend who told me
licks and like just
I don't know like take a loan and and
play again or whatever and then I could
find myself in depth
so yeah I think it's uh
it's super crucial

[39:00]
it's super crucial
um and and it was very very helpful for
me
um and also ever since I've also done
like a lot of uh uh basically walk on
myself just as a person so going to a
therapist uh
four years

[39:15]
four years
um
and doing some mental game coaching uh
doing all this kind of stuff and also
just evolving it as a person just like
um basically when I don't know how most
therapists work but for me it's like

[39:31]
therapists work but for me it's like
whenever I'm seeing my third piece he's
like he's basically putting a mirror to
my life and showing me like listen you
uh I'm telling him some stuff and then
he's saying listen you're doing this
because of ABC so what you should do is

[39:45]
because of ABC so what you should do is
just you should first pay attention to
it and then I would basically what
happens today is after like a long
progress already
um what happens is in in even in my life
I would go and let's say somebody said
something to me on the street and it

[40:00]
something to me on the street and it
would give me like a certain emotion and
then I would say like oh this is not
happening because of me or him this is
just happening because this brings like
a certain system inside me that makes me
feel this way and it's okay like this is

[40:15]
feel this way and it's okay like this is
who I am it's it's fine like I I should
just know that it's there and how to
handle it not that it control me so
I think this also uh brings a lot of uh
good stuff to the Pokemon tour game

[40:30]
good stuff to the Pokemon tour game
because again like let's say I get
cooler than
I I start feeling this pain inside and I
say like okay like was there anything I
could do no then it's okay I should feel
pain like I just lost a big amount of

[40:45]
pain like I just lost a big amount of
money or like I busted out of a deep run
but it's it's fine it's it's a part of
the process it's it's all good
um and then I think the problem starts
when you make uh mistakes like
um and and then that's much harder to

[41:00]
um and and then that's much harder to
that was the part that was much harder
for me like I think I was very
unforgiven to myself so I would make a
mistake I remember one huge mistake I I
made in a live tournament where I just
didn't pay attention to a guy's stack

[41:15]
didn't pay attention to a guy's stack
size and it if I did pay attention the
spot was super easy and then I literally
got I I busted like uh
a tournament and I remember I was just
unable to play for days
I was basically on Mega tilt for like
two or three days something that never

[41:31]
two or three days something that never
happened to me because I don't know like
I was just like I was feeling I'm so
much better than this how did I not pay
attention how did I do this and then we
again with just walking on myself as a

[41:45]
again with just walking on myself as a
person and learning to forgive myself
for in real life mistakes
um I learned that it's okay like I'm
gonna make mistakes every day in poker
in life in whatever and it's just okay
and I think this was the biggest uh

[42:03]
and I think this was the biggest uh
um I guess
how does I don't know how to say it but
like the biggest progress I guess I made
as a person and as a poker player
because Danny just uh brought me from uh

[42:17]
because Danny just uh brought me from uh
uh stood in a point where I can you know
I can make mistakes and then it's gonna
be like the mistakes are gonna be there
and if I'm gonna get tilted every time
then it's it's not gonna work but
nowadays uh of course I can get uh upset

[42:33]
nowadays uh of course I can get uh upset
with mistakes but I'm just gonna see the
positive side in it first of all uh just
learning more and more to forgive myself
and realizing that it happens every day
and second just okay I made a mistake

[42:45]
and second just okay I made a mistake
how do I improve from that point what
can I do to not make it again
um I think often we also make mistakes
like not one not two even like five
times until we learn how to do it some
people they do it they can do it after
one time for me it's it's usually a bit

[43:01]
one time for me it's it's usually a bit
slower I need I need to I need to do it
like two or three times
um but yeah I think it's uh
that's basically a long story short
that's my that's my process that was

[43:15]
that's my that's my process that was
amazing that was a mindset masterclass
and answered a lot of questions I had in
my mind about how someone goes from a
degenerate kind of gambling nature to
build the mindset that's actually very
tolerant to risk and very balanced and
as you mentioned there first of all you
had some good friends around you to uh

[43:30]
had some good friends around you to uh
straight that right balance to push back
on you I think when you've got
degenerate Tendencies you kind of
walking a knife edge a little bit one
you kind of want to back yourself but
also you're a bit of a loose cannon who
could like go off the rails in in a bad
situations so it's good to have someone
around you to stress test you make sure

[43:45]
around you to stress test you make sure
you're not taking on too much risk which
sounds like you've had I think the main
skill that you really learn is going
deep into yourself and exploring you
said you already had this self-awareness
but you definitely fine-tuned that skill
in understanding like the triggers and
responses I call them where life's in
you're interacting with life and things
are triggering emotional responses

[44:01]
are triggering emotional responses
what's going on there what's causing
these emotions come in me inside of me
how to understand them better and how do
I learn to stay calm in the face of them
and then you mentioned like the kind of
a big one for you which I think a lot of
players can relate to or make a mistakes
one of the real biggest triggers I

[44:15]
one of the real biggest triggers I
experience working with players not
forgiving themselves being very hard on
themselves when they make mistakes he
mentions learn to forgive yourself and
then also kind of directing your
attention to what how can I improve from
this mistake so for yourself in terms of
things that maybe bother you now is
there anything that still causes any

[44:30]
there anything that still causes any
emotions anything that you still need to
be mindful of or aware of as you're
going through your career
um
I would say it's it's all of those stuff
but just uh
they are much less like empowered I

[44:47]
they are much less like empowered I
guess they are just much smaller so I
would still uh get cooler than I would
multiple a few bad words or whatever I
think it's okay
um
and
yeah I think I think it's just important

[45:01]
yeah I think I think it's just important
for one to realize
um what these problems are and just like
focus on how we can improve them
um for me I guess right now it's like
uh
it's it's those things just in in minor

[45:17]
it's it's those things just in in minor
cases I would say like I get cooler in a
big spot or like uh I would make a
stupid cooldown or like a stupid Bluff
or like whatever and I would be uh I
would be feeling some negative emotions

[45:31]
would be feeling some negative emotions
but I would know how to handle it and
just move on and save that handy story
for later uh or maybe like what what
happens often is uh nowadays like
whenever I play cash then I would have

[45:45]
whenever I play cash then I would have
like two one two two three friends
actually who play in the same pools
every day and I would share some
I I can sometimes even share an history
like right at the moment like I just
played a hand and I would like I have a

[46:00]
played a hand and I would like I have a
friend at the table or like playing a
different table but he's online I will
just share it at the moment and then
like you would be like oh you played it
fine you even though like I I thought
like I just made a big punt or whatever
and he said no no it's actually okay and
then those those kind of things uh or

[46:16]
then those those kind of things uh or
like he's actually he can say like it's
actually a big punt when you think about
it now but in game I could have made the
same uh thing like I could see where
you're coming from or whatever so I
think uh yeah I think in general this
this helps a lot also

[46:31]
this helps a lot also
um but but I don't know nowadays I feel
like at least on the mental part I
believe there is always a room for
improvement but
um I feel pretty confident in that area
at least
um yeah I like the Avengers cupboard

[46:45]
um yeah I like the Avengers cupboard
there one from the self-awareness of
understanding your responses then also
again inputs from other players other
people very often we're sore in our own
heads we are caught up in our own
problems that we can't see the kind of
clarity of the situation as well so
getting someone else to uh either let

[47:00]
getting someone else to uh either let
you know you've made a mistake or to
show some sympathy often helps a lot
with our kind of uh process of forgiving
ourselves and rationalizing what we're
trying to do I'm really curious to know
um how your relationship with risk has
changed as your career has progressed so
let's say at the start of your career

[47:15]
let's say at the start of your career
definitely that the generic kind of risk
taker how is your relationship to risk
change because obviously from the
outside you're still taking big risks
you're playing some of the highest games
in tough lineups how do you feel like
you've altered how you take risks how do
you kind of view uh what the fact is
that contribute to take a risk

[47:32]
that contribute to take a risk
so it's a good question
um I think
um it's kind of interesting because
nowadays I basically split my action
into two like I would play
I guess a similar amount of mtts and

[47:45]
I guess a similar amount of mtts and
cash games nowadays
um at least for now
um and it changes a lot but the main
idea I think would be to uh foreign
what kind of bankroll management rules
work for you not what kind of bankroll

[48:02]
work for you not what kind of bankroll
management rules somebody told you or
you've seen on a course
that would be a good Baseline to start
from but then like for me for example I
got people ask me like what do you think
is a proper bankroll management for cash

[48:16]
is a proper bankroll management for cash
games and I would say I have no I have
no idea like I don't know it could be 40
buys it could be 20 binds it could be
200 buys I really don't know it depends
on which game you're playing what Edge
you have in that game
um

[48:30]
um
uh I don't know like how many tables
you're playing like what what are your
commitments as a person do you have like
a family do you have kids to feed do you
have like a mortgage I don't know there
could be so many factors in that system
and so for me I'm single uh I don't have

[48:48]
and so for me I'm single uh I don't have
many commitments uh I pay rent and maybe
I have some Investments going or
whatever but other than that uh yeah not
many not many commitments so basically

[49:00]
many not many commitments so basically
what I'm thinking is I just want to
have the most action of myself possible
of whatever I'm playing even if it means
taking some big shots uh but the reason
I'm being able to do it is just because
uh basically in whatever field I was

[49:17]
uh basically in whatever field I was
playing I've been really I've been
winning a lot and been really consistent
um so I'm basically saying like unless
something changes I'm just gonna take
big risks so let's say if the if the
scale of bankroll management is between

[49:31]
scale of bankroll management is between
I don't know 20 to 200 buys I would be
much closer to 20 bytes for example and
I remember having like uh
nowadays it's like it takes like a
really big game or like a really big
tournament for me to to start selling

[49:46]
tournament for me to to start selling
action but I remember uh
uh when I was considering like taking a
bigger shot and I would actually take
some really big shots
uh to play like a really good high pay
high stakes game just because I felt

[50:01]
high stakes game just because I felt
like if I lose those one two three four
five buy-ins today it's gonna be really
painful but I can handle it and I can
just do like some kind of reset and I've
done it a few times like I've had like
at least 10 days in my life or like 15

[50:15]
at least 10 days in my life or like 15
days over the last couple of years where
I lost like a huge amount where some
people would say like in percentage of
bankroll it's like illegal to lose this
amount or whatever but basically it was
followed by me
uh going back to the office the next day

[50:30]
uh going back to the office the next day
and saying okay I just took a really big
hit that's okay because I I made a good
decision
um and that's also another thing that is
important is does it affect your game so
if you let's say you're it's too big for
you and and it's starting to affect your

[50:47]
you and and it's starting to affect your
game that's then obviously you want to
selection
um and yeah I think for me it's it's
been really good this way because every
time something like that happened I came
back much stronger like I came back I
granted I grinded it back up not like

[51:01]
granted I grinded it back up not like
really back up because it's not like I
lost 80 of my bank or anything maybe
just something like five to ten percent
um and then I would just be like uh yeah
starting over if it was like a 200 400

[51:15]
starting over if it was like a 200 400
game I would play 25.50 the next day and
would only jump into higher games if I
sell action or if the game is really
really good or whatever and once there
were like games like I said with imagine
things they they ran consistently and
Super High games and a lot of tables

[51:30]
Super High games and a lot of tables
then I would sell a lot of action I
think it's only like natural to do it
this way so I think uh for successful
players out there I would say
uh you want to take shots you want to be
aggressive with shots even for
tournaments uh or cash games even
tournaments it's

[51:46]
tournaments it's
it's a lot more it's it's different uh I
can expand some more about it but
um yeah like you you just want to as
long as you don't have many commitments
you just want to take the risks and
again like this is as long as you can

[52:01]
again like this is as long as you can
afford uh the mental uh pain of of uh of
those uh expenses
um or those losses
um and this is I think just the process
of yourself you have to you have to try

[52:16]
of yourself you have to you have to try
different things
of course don't play for 50 of your
bankroll but just try to be a bit more
aggressive than you are if you're doing
well and see how you feel if you're
let's say you you know you now had like
a huge loss how do you feel the same day

[52:30]
a huge loss how do you feel the same day
how do you feel the next day
how is your like
how do you feel when coming back to the
tables and playing lower uh or like
selling action for the same game or
whatever and and just seeing how that
feels and and being always super Dynamic
about it because I think what I see is

[52:46]
about it because I think what I see is
that for example I have some uh some
friend who is a really successful entity
player
um and he's selling I think too much
action
and that's his way that's okay but I
think like I couldn't I couldn't do it

[53:00]
think like I couldn't I couldn't do it
maybe that's a system that works for him
uh but if I was doing uh that system and
not trying to be as aggressive as I am
with the management then I think uh I
would be uh I would have much less money

[53:15]
would be uh I would have much less money
than today and one could say that maybe
you know maybe I also ran good during my
career maybe things could be different
for sure but I just believe the approach
is good just uh yeah like I remember
like last year I had like a really big
downswing and I remember just uh

[53:32]
downswing and I remember just uh
basically what happened it it was the
best thing ever it was the best thing
ever happened to me because I had like a
downswing for six months after the best
year in my career
basically I started 2022 with winning a

[53:45]
basically I started 2022 with winning a
lot of money and then losing it all back
in six months so basically around uh
around September I was break even for
the year and I was really nervous about
it because I said like this is pretty
sick like I was up like I don't know

[54:00]
sick like I was up like I don't know
like uh a sick amount after three months
and then like just losing it all in six
months like what's going on and then I
started to analyze like what happened
during those six months and I realized I
wasn't studying as much I was traveling
back and forth to like uh live stops and

[54:17]
back and forth to like uh live stops and
all of those things really hurt my game
because what happens is I'm gonna play a
livestock then it takes me like that's
at least how it is for me it takes me
like one to two weeks just to uh to see
uh to get into my best form of playing

[54:31]
uh to get into my best form of playing
live or like to a decent form of playing
live now because the game is different
and then I would go back to online and
the same thing happens and then in
between you drop a lot of buyers whoever
you're playing entities or cash games
you're just playing living a lot of
Eevee over there and I realized okay

[54:46]
Eevee over there and I realized okay
this is not for this is not working for
me I should do something about it then I
realized okay I'm just gonna go back
into the lab back into the cash game
streets and I'm not gonna travel for a
while I remember this was I'm not like
uh like the kind of guy who likes to

[55:01]
uh like the kind of guy who likes to
plan uh long ahead like people ask me
like uh what I'm what I'm gonna do next
week and it's hard for me to to say uh
but I remember back then it was
September and I said like until March
I'm gonna stay at home like I'm not
going anywhere unless it's like a

[55:16]
going anywhere unless it's like a
vacation or something but I'm definitely
not gonna play a livestock and and it
was like that
and for six months I've basically uh
maybe I I went for like three days of
Life some at some point but for six
months I basically stayed in Israel uh

[55:32]
months I basically stayed in Israel uh
starting playing and ever since I've had
the biggest upswing ever
um and I realized like okay this is the
system that works for me this is what I
need to do
um so then I decided okay now I want to
play some live so I basically uh planned

[55:47]
play some live so I basically uh planned
ahead to do like uh two weeks of EPT
Monte Carlo two weeks of Triton in
Cyprus and then the entire Vegas uh trip
as long as I have the
um I still have the energy to do it and

[56:00]
um I still have the energy to do it and
that's basically what happened and I I
think it was my my best Vegas ever
because I I came with the with already
being uh into the live streets after one
month of prior to that
and I was in a very good mental state I

[56:16]
and I was in a very good mental state I
had really good results
um yeah just everything clicked and I
think this is super important like just
figuring out what's good for you and to
do that you need to try different things
you need to really listen to yourself
and see like how you feel about certain

[56:32]
and see like how you feel about certain
things and
um sometimes uh some people I think that
the biggest problem is they are not
aware of those things
or some people would even be aware and
they just don't know how to handle it

[56:45]
they just don't know how to handle it
like certain emotions certain feelings
so I think this is like one of my best
friends uh strengths sorry just being
able to communicate about these things
with different players communicate about
it with myself always uh

[57:00]
it with myself always uh
like like I said just being like very uh
results oriented in a good way for once
just like think oh this brings good
results maybe I should do this more like
in Vegas this year I got into doing cold
showers and I would do like I don't know

[57:17]
showers and I would do like I don't know
five to seven minutes of culture every
day
um until I at some point I I was sick
and I just couldn't
um but uh
it was so good because I would see like
it gets me started in a really good way

[57:32]
it gets me started in a really good way
and then I also eat Alfie because I'm
saying oh like
I I was super focused and super present
all day because of those cold showers
and because of uh like consistency in in
waking up at a certain time and and

[57:45]
waking up at a certain time and and
trying to arrive at the tables early and
and doing all of this kind of stuff and
then one brings uh one thing brings
another good thing you're just doing
well in in different areas and yeah for
me it was it was amazing like I I felt
it myself and also uh my roommate uh in

[58:03]
it myself and also uh my roommate uh in
Vegas who is a really good friend told
me the same like he felt like for both
of us uh mentally it was definitely the
best Vegas
um for both of us so it was pretty cool
um yeah I think it highlights really

[58:15]
um yeah I think it highlights really
importantly how much you need to find
what works for you and I really like how
you frame the downswing is the best
thing to happen to you because that
downswing was a cut-less moment ago
right what I'm doing is not working I'm
doing these live stuff so I'm doing
online I'm kind of in between both and
I'm not performing optimally and either

[58:30]
I'm not performing optimally and either
the system I've created to perform at a
high level isn't working I need to
reassess this I need to uh lock myself
away focus on online for a bit and then
reevaluate the online stuff the
livestock sorry so you have yourself
really trying to uh double down on what
works and find that system for yourself

[58:45]
works and find that system for yourself
I think anyone watching this who's going
through a downswing listening to this uh
can use the same kind of philosophy to
go right what's what's not working right
now and what do I need to change what do
I control in this situation and how can
I change some things in my environment
or how I'm approaching things to uh see
some forward motion

[59:02]
some forward motion

further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode
I'm really curious to you for you

[1:01:15]
I'm really curious to you for you
because obviously um listening to speak
it's clear you've got a very high
tolerance for risk and you mentioned
like some factors in terms of your life
circumstances uh the games you play the
kind of overall being young and not much
commitments overall you're in a
situation where you maybe can't take

[1:01:30]
situation where you maybe can't take
more risk than the average person but
you also mentioned something important
that you said I can handle it I mean I
can handle when things go badly I'm
interested to know um how do you handle
when you take risks and things go badly
you mentioned like 10 or 15 days when
things got a bit scary and not not so

[1:01:46]
things got a bit scary and not not so
great recently because when you've got
this kind of high risk kind of approach
you've got to almost like factor in that
you've almost gone for the extreme Downs
as well in terms of the Swing so for
yourself how do you handle really big
swing zones what are the things you do

[1:02:00]
swing zones what are the things you do
to keep yourself seeing earns mentally
active
that's a good one
um so I think like if I look back at
some of those days
um first of all I think some of them uh

[1:02:15]
um first of all I think some of them uh
I was probably not performing very well
uh I remember like there was a day where
I was playing uh like the night before I
went out with friends getting drunk
whatever and then waking up the next day
an action was insane and just sit down

[1:02:31]
an action was insane and just sit down
and play for example so it just goes
back to
again we we have even though sometimes
we have zero responsibility of what
happened uh well we could have some but
um sometimes it's even zero uh things

[1:02:45]
um sometimes it's even zero uh things
just happen I think we I still like to
take accountability for myself even uh
when things uh go wrong in a variance
kind of matter which I think is is a
really good skill uh it might be going a

[1:03:00]
really good skill uh it might be going a
bit too harsh on yourself but I think in
general it's a good approach for poker
because it it just it it makes you more
committed to improve even more
um that's at least how I see it so I
think it's a it's a really good uh

[1:03:15]
think it's a it's a really good uh
thing that I have in my character that's
deep inside me
but uh
yeah I just lost track of what so yeah I
think it's uh
I think if I look back at how I felt

[1:03:30]
I think if I look back at how I felt
let's say like I had a huge losing
session how I felt right after and how I
felt the day after
so I think right after I would just feel
like a big amount of pain it's just like
um like I don't know you just uh you

[1:03:46]
um like I don't know you just uh you
just don't want to do many things you
just want to sit there
and there would be uh probably uh
some maybe healthier ways to deal with
it maybe some meditation maybe some uh

[1:04:01]
it maybe some meditation maybe some uh
yeah I don't know uh talking to friends
or whatever usually I would talk to
friends
I some people they they I think again
like you need to figure out what's
working for you in that way
but in a way that it's not uh

[1:04:16]
but in a way that it's not uh
destructive never for you and your
friends because there would be someone
who is going to share it with his
friends in a way that ah listen I just
lost like 100k I hate my life look at
this hand that I lost and this is not

[1:04:30]
this hand that I lost and this is not
helpful like this is not like
uh even if you if you even if you give
the same amount of information like I
could send a hand to my friend and see
like like look look what just happened
like this is insane
um but I would just had like a few

[1:04:46]
um but I would just had like a few
laughing Smiles or whatever just just to
light it up just to make it seem like
because I'm not the kind of guy who
likes to uh cry about these things I
almost never share bad beats or anything
like that I don't see any I don't see
anything useful about it

[1:05:01]
anything useful about it
um but I actually have a friend who does
it
um and he's not getting tilted by it
it's just helping him to release so
again I think for him for example for
example it it works good but for his
friends it doesn't

[1:05:15]
friends it doesn't
um so I think just being able to uh to
realize that you're feeling pain and
that's okay you just need to to go
through it like let's say uh you went on
a date and you got rejected

[1:05:31]
a date and you got rejected
that's that's fine like
most of the time when you're going on a
first date it's just not gonna work I
don't know unless you're like some kind
of magician
um and and it's gonna happen in a lot of
aspects of life like you're just gonna
you're just gonna feel like uh failure

[1:05:48]
you're just gonna feel like uh failure
the hard part I think about poker is
sometimes you're gonna perform at your
best but the result is gonna suck and
that's the that's the hard part but I
think once you go to enough of these uh
swings you just

[1:06:00]
swings you just
I don't know for me it's kind of natural
like I would just feel the pain
sometimes for me like if it's really
extreme I always have like emotional
eating it's not like I'm just gonna eat
like three kilos of food right now and I
would get like ice cream or like a

[1:06:15]
would get like ice cream or like a
pancake or whatever just eat something
nice uh like watch some Netflix I don't
know just chill sit with some friends
um yeah try to try to just take it easy
for like 12 to 24 hours
uh probably not play again even though

[1:06:31]
uh probably not play again even though
I've I've had some like there was like
this recreational who played for like
two days
and he would basically jump in and out
like five times a day during those two
days and it was a really big game and I
remember losing like a huge amount

[1:06:47]
remember losing like a huge amount
um after like two sessions and then like
it's also very hard because now I have
to selection
and now every dollar I'm gonna win back
is only gonna be 50 cents so it's it's
kind of tough uh but I I just realized

[1:07:01]
kind of tough uh but I I just realized
okay if I'm gonna jump back in I'm gonna
have to do it and I I think I even want
like a decent amount back but I was just
again like just responsible enough to do
it and experience enough to do it
um so again I think it's it's just like

[1:07:15]
um so again I think it's it's just like
yeah we have like a certain like poker
is a profession like we have to we have
to respect it and we have to treat it as
one uh so yeah I think
I think in general just acknowledging
the pain and going through it that's

[1:07:30]
the pain and going through it that's
just I think yeah life is not all uh
rainbow and sunshines you have to go
through some pain you have to go through
some failures you have to go through
some mistakes do some bad faces that's
okay but you just have to to keep going
you just have to keep keep doing your

[1:07:45]
you just have to keep keep doing your
thing and if you trust the process and
you trust yourself to do it
good things are going to happen yeah I
think you've touched on something really
important here of experience and pain
and I think we're very very often
aversed the pain we move away from it it

[1:08:00]
aversed the pain we move away from it it
was funny I just went an ice bath before
this
um conversation at the gym and someone
jumped in with me for like three seconds
then jumped out I was like oh the pain
got too much I did didn't want to
experience there especially just we move
away from Pain and often we play poker
players experience pain they want to
numb it they want to distract themselves

[1:08:16]
numb it they want to distract themselves
it sounds like for you you allow
yourself to experience pain obviously
occasionally you'll do things to uh
maybe lower it but I think you'll use
pain as a kind of a guide to uh reflect
on to move forward and I think once we
realize everything we experience good
bad is kind of Fleet in we have moments

[1:08:31]
bad is kind of Fleet in we have moments
of Joy moms of Happiness moments of pain
and there's nothing to run away from
there's just like experience in it I
think that's one of those subtle things
like as we speak about it some people
will not understand like how what we're
trying to say like experience and pain
like what does that actually mean so for
you uh how do you uh tolerate pain all

[1:08:47]
you uh how do you uh tolerate pain all
right success we're quite diverse as
humans too we're going through a payment
experience how do you allow yourself not
to overreact right let's say you've had
this really bad session you're in a bit
of pain the mind's getting overactive
what are some of the things you do in
those kind of 6 to 12 hours that allows

[1:09:02]
those kind of 6 to 12 hours that allows
you to be with the pain or to uh
reflecting the pain in a more practical
way
so for me it's kind of funny
um I actually have a friend who likes to
say that uh

[1:09:15]
say that uh
he can he's a live player and he likes
to say that like when he's looking at
someone during a live stop he can
basically say he is doing well during
the trip in in two seconds and also like
if he's doing well today like if he had
a session today and if he's winning or

[1:09:30]
a session today and if he's winning or
losing and he's pretty accurate about it
like I remember a bunch of times where
he like whispered to me like listening
is like winning or he's losing and then
it came out to be right
um and and about me is is usually saying
like I I almost don't notice it about

[1:09:45]
like I I almost don't notice it about
you
um which for me is is like a big
compliment because it's basically what
I'm trying to achieve
um so I think
basically what I'm trying to do is first
of all uh uh feeling it so first of all
I would quit the session and

[1:10:02]
I would quit the session and
at some point and then I would just okay
like what now
um so I would just walk around the house
I don't know feeling starting to feel
the pain it's gonna be right here
um and then I would realize like I would

[1:10:18]
um and then I would realize like I would
talk to myself or like share with a
friend that I was doing really badly and
maybe I could have done something better
maybe I I could do something better for
the next time maybe like maybe it's just

[1:10:30]
the next time maybe like maybe it's just
okay but I'm just feeling pain I want to
share first of all this this thing helps
and then just communicating with myself
and realizing like even let's say
the most extreme scenario let's say I
lost 10 of my bankroll or something uh
which maybe happened once um I would

[1:10:48]
which maybe happened once um I would
just say like
it's okay I knew what I'm getting into
and I probably thought the spot is
really good and it was worth the risk uh
and I'm gonna have to like I'm just
gonna look back at some Milestones like

[1:11:01]
gonna look back at some Milestones like
I'm just gonna say like
um it's actually something that I'm
probably not doing enough uh as a person
in general but like
um
like realizing how far I've come uh but

[1:11:15]
like realizing how far I've come uh but
then of those at those moments I think
it can be really useful just realizing
like listen I I'm I'm at a very good
place like uh yeah just just give myself
some uh some boost like some some good
points that I've done uh some things

[1:11:31]
points that I've done uh some things
that I'm achieved that I've just I've
achieved and and that I'm in a good
place in life whoever I lost this money
today or not
and just that uh yeah starting to uh the
pain is gonna be either I don't know

[1:11:45]
pain is gonna be either I don't know
it's not really like I can say these
things and then it's just gonna
disappear I kind of feel like after a
good night's sleep I just wake up much
better the next day
um that's usually uh the best thing I
can get
um

[1:12:00]
um
so I I used to like taking walks when it
happened
um I would just go around play music uh
for me I really like music music is
really motivating and and good for me in
different moods
um so I will just put my headphones go

[1:12:17]
um so I will just put my headphones go
for like a one one hour of just walking
around letting my thoughts just go
through my head and breathing some air
just going outside of the house and then
yeah I don't know just do regular stuff
just watch TV just let the time go by or

[1:12:32]
just watch TV just let the time go by or
just go to sleep depends on what the
time is and I feel like
it's probably used to be sometimes
painful even one day after that but now
there nowadays I feel like it's kind of
over at that point after I wake up it's

[1:12:46]
over at that point after I wake up it's
just another day and
yeah we keep going
I love it I love as well that there was
no rush to get rid of the pain I think
this is the mistake people often make
they almost like want the Pain to End
straight away for you you are first of

[1:13:01]
straight away for you you are first of
all being with it and it's like right
this hurts ah this sucks let's stop what
I'm doing is be with the pain then you
went through like a process of reframing
it uh speaking with other people getting
sort of some cognitive understand of
what actually happens and then also you
mentioned like being grateful for your
situation looking back in the Milestones

[1:13:16]
situation looking back in the Milestones
you've taken so all these things are
helping you to uh process the motion
feel it at the same time the pain still
there for a period of time so yeah I
think there's understand that not trying
to rush through this process allow me to
unfold naturally doing the right things
that allow you to uh deal with it and

[1:13:30]
that allow you to uh deal with it and
yeah knowing that pain plus reflection
equals growth almost always if you can
learn to be with painful emotions
painful situations generally you're
growing through that period so for you
uh you've also obviously built the skill
over time so you tolerate it better and
better you're kind of refractory period
of coming back around from a painful

[1:13:46]
of coming back around from a painful
period to feel okay again it's probably
less than a day now maybe in the past it
was a lot longer which was yeah maybe
super super powerful and I think those
those skills that you learn there are
really useful for The Listener as well
ready for yourself how do you deal with
the pain of being a poker player

[1:14:01]
the pain of being a poker player
well that has been a Evolution
throughout my career I think uh I think
I should be touching this a couple times
throughout various podcasts one podcast
specifically stands out for me for the
maybe new listeners I think it was a
second podcast that we did with benefit

[1:14:16]
second podcast that we did with benefit
beat he he talked a lot about the the
sitting with the emotions I remember
really really pointed out and I actually
went through a similar process where I
started to realize also through work
with therapy and to becoming more

[1:14:30]
with therapy and to becoming more
reflective and self-aware of the
behavior like oh every time when I lose
or every time when I make a mistake I
feel bad about myself and I don't want
to feel bad about myself so what I do
immediately I go full in the grind I go
I do everything to remove that feeling I
do everything besides feeding the

[1:14:46]
do everything besides feeding the
feeling all right other people might do
worse habits you know they might get
drunk or something like that at least I
will got productive with it it sort of
motivated me to work on my game or to
analyze the whole spot to make sure I
needed like some sort of um some sort of

[1:15:00]
needed like some sort of um some sort of
an outcome either I play laid the hand
badly and I've learned something from it
or I can conclusion listen you didn't do
anything wrong I just couldn't deal with
the feeling of insecurity and when I
worked also with therapy it's like wow
okay you don't like to feel insecure
about yourself and you try to do all
this Behavior to make sure that doesn't

[1:15:16]
this Behavior to make sure that doesn't
happen right you become maybe
perfectionistic so you don't get this
situation where you feel insecure and
basically you design your whole life
just not to feel that feeling whereas
the way easier solution is just feel the
feeling and be okay with it and that's

[1:15:30]
feeling and be okay with it and that's
something that I really highlighted that
you mentioned many times it's okay I
feel like it gets way worse as a poker
player when you're like I think you even
mentioned ah I get cooler then I shout a
couple of words maybe some people are
listening like oh no when when I get
cool it I should just not respond
because that's the way it's supposed to

[1:15:46]
because that's the way it's supposed to
be yeah it's gonna be quite hard right
if your expectation is yeah okay I
should just be the Zen master while
playing or I should not show my emotions
and then the emotions do come up yeah
and then you maybe you're only making it
worse whereas if you just accept the
fact that you're human and everyone

[1:16:00]
fact that you're human and everyone
responds to these emotions and a
different way
um yeah you have to you have to just
accept that and I've also highlighted
the word empathy I think this also
actually the trend that comes comes
along quite often through throughout our
podcast I think that's kind of when you

[1:16:15]
podcast I think that's kind of when you
mature you start to notice that empathy
is actually a very good way out of these
kind of situations so yeah I mean I deal
with my fair share of pain here and
there fair share of bad emotions uh I
think another point that I wrote down as
well yeah when when something triggers

[1:16:31]
well yeah when when something triggers
you it's trying to tell you something
right I usually especially like to
reflect on things where I feel like I
respond overly emotional right if
someone punches you in the face it's
okay to be angry but to its degree you
understand are you gonna are you gonna

[1:16:46]
understand are you gonna are you gonna
look him up hunting down and and Destroy
his whole family that seems a little bit
overreactive
so yeah understand so
of course to a certain degree you can
you can react but if you react over
emotionally to a situation situation

[1:17:00]
emotionally to a situation situation
there's probably something to learn
about yourself right and try to dig a
bit me uh try to dig a bit deeper like
oh this is not only emotion that I'm
letting out from this event this is
apparently accumulated emotion something
that's even deeper and I think
definitely working with a therapist and

[1:17:16]
definitely working with a therapist and
trying to resolve that I think uh think
will help you a lot but because
obviously if a trigger triggers not only
the motion of this moment but also
emotions of the past it can be very
overwhelming and harder to deal with so
then we have to resolve the underlying
emotions but definitely emotions like a

[1:17:31]
emotions but definitely emotions like a
compass it shows you where you can make
progress as a human and then
automatically also as uh as a poker
player of course
um wanted to go
quickly jump into your transition from
entities to cash games I was curious

[1:17:46]
entities to cash games I was curious
what kind of strategical adjustments did
you had to make when switching from
entities to Cache do you remember a
couple things that we were like
struggling with like oh this is a bit
different
yeah
um

[1:18:01]
um
first of all I think
um
kovid here was a really good uh
was a really good preparation for the
for the switch because basically until
kovid I was basically kind of like a

[1:18:15]
kovid I was basically kind of like a
street player I would play
kind of freestyle of course I knew like
ranges and and stuff and maybe maybe was
introduced to to solver outputs a few
times but uh
not not much work down in this direction

[1:18:32]
not not much work down in this direction
at least not like uh technically maybe
like manually just talking about a hand
and analyze Theory this way
um
and then during covet I thought like
okay I'm playing online again so I need

[1:18:46]
okay I'm playing online again so I need
to probably
um and I'm playing higher now I I should
probably get like a coach or something
and I got like some coachings for uh for
Theory stuff and and improved a lot in
that direction started working with

[1:19:01]
that direction started working with
solvers basically
um and then when I was switching to
catch games I was already somewhat uh
somewhat good with with Theory and and
solvers and

[1:19:15]
solvers and
I think uh when I met when I made the
switch of course first of all it's like
you're playing a completely different
game it's basically different ranges
um different environment everything is
different and at first it's like it's

[1:19:31]
different and at first it's like it's
really tough because you kind of have to
switch your like meta game beliefs
um some things works for you really well
in in one game and then in the other
format it's it's gonna just be dust

[1:19:46]
format it's it's gonna just be dust
you're just gonna be giving away money
and the other way around and yeah I
think I think I was just in a really
good environment
and still am in a really good
environment of people who just study and

[1:20:02]
environment of people who just study and
play the game consistently and
are really aware of like the theory
Concepts and and the exploits you have
to go to
um in order to to win at your game and

[1:20:15]
um in order to to win at your game and
to try and do basically to to get the
highest Eevee possible I remember
um there was like
I'm not even sure about the screen names
and I just don't want to say uh even if
even if I do that I'm just I'm not going

[1:20:30]
even if I do that I'm just I'm not going
to say the screen name but there was
like this one guy a couple years ago who
maybe even got dead I'm not sure uh he
was like 99
uh using real-time assistance uh and
everybody knew it basically and me and

[1:20:46]
everybody knew it basically and me and
uh doody who is a friend of me uh we
basically throughout the year he had a
2x no win rate than him
so he was basically playing a perfect
strategy but we we were winning uh uh I

[1:21:01]
strategy but we we were winning uh uh I
think he was winning like 4B 100 and we
had like an HPV win rate uh over like
2021 or something and I I think this
comes from like a lot of adjustments and
work you have to do that doesn't involve
Theory
um so that's that's always really nice

[1:21:16]
um so that's that's always really nice
to see because some people say oh like
if there is like an RTA the games are
dead or like if there is like the
solvers got to a certain amount where
you can now just uh you you can solve
any spot with AI in two seconds then
what's the point it's solved no it's not

[1:21:32]
what's the point it's solved no it's not
solved you can just do so many things
and even if one is gonna watch
uh the the games that are going on like
right now like the free 400 games uh of
the best guys you're gonna see that as

[1:21:45]
the best guys you're gonna see that as
well like many they're gonna be many
hands where people uh don't play the the
perfect strategy and of course some of
it is just gonna be a mistake but some
of it is just gonna be uh with a reason
behind it so yeah I think there is this

[1:22:02]
behind it so yeah I think there is this
is one of my best parts about the game
why I love it so much because it's not
sold
there is so many things you can do
um and like every day you learn
something new you try something new it's
pretty cool

[1:22:17]
pretty cool
you already mentioned a bit earlier
uh about the jump between I think 5 10
to 10 20 which jump in Stakes for you
was the hardest was that that jumped
from to play against 5K

[1:22:31]
um so in cash games I think everything
went pretty smoothly
um
I've had some struggles going from 5 10
10 20 to 25 50. I did have those
struggles

[1:22:46]
struggles
um but
I would say it was probably the hardest
because above that it was already all
pretty similar and everything was going
pretty smooth
um

[1:23:00]
um
but if I had to guess I I would assume
it was somewhere around the MTT World
actually
um it's going from playing like I don't
know
mistakes to high stakes entities
and then like playing live high stakes

[1:23:17]
and then like playing live high stakes
entities to nosebleed high stakes
entities they would be I think those are
really tough because
there you actually have such a such a
small Edge
and the variants can be so crucial

[1:23:32]
and the variants can be so crucial
um and yeah I I like to take big shots
like I said so this can be really really
painful at times
um if things are not going well
so yeah
I think this is probably the hardest one

[1:23:46]
I think this is probably the hardest one
in mtts and in cash games it was
probably moving up to 5K because above
that again I feel like
maybe there is a certain difference to
playing 20K 40K games uh
uh like 20K 40K or like 5K 10K but in

[1:24:02]
uh like 20K 40K or like 5K 10K but in
general it's
it's somewhat similar I think or like
it's not it's not as hard as moving from
5 10 to 25 feet it's less at least
that's how I approach it
um

[1:24:15]
um
what was it about like the way the
opponents or the the other regulars at
the games then play at the higher Stakes
that makes them harder to play against
um so first of all

[1:24:32]
um so first of all
I think uh
I think they're just gonna be much more
uh
stronger
uh just about their like Theory
they're just gonna be a lot more uh

[1:24:45]
they're just gonna be a lot more uh
accurate
and then they are also gonna pay
attention a lot more to what you're
doing and how they can uh basically
backfire it into your face and yeah I
think this is probably the main part I

[1:25:01]
think this is probably the main part I
would say just yeah being uh really
really accurate theoretically and and
just being able to to do the adjustments
needed to to take you down
yeah I would say I experienced the same

[1:25:17]
yeah I would say I experienced the same
basically the more you go up the stakes
the less leaks players have so the more
you're kind of you don't really see
anymore where the EV is made it's like
yeah well I cannot really attack here I
cannot really attack it there and then
you kind of refer to a more defensive

[1:25:31]
you kind of refer to a more defensive
type of strategy which feels a bit more
that you just handed into the poker
girls who's going to win or not so yeah
it just makes it it just makes people
way harder to to to play against and
indeed obviously also the pools are
smaller so they pay way more attention

[1:25:46]
smaller so they pay way more attention
to you as a specific player so uh yeah
you have to think way deeper in terms of
okay not only how do I play against you
but how would this player play against
me so it's also way more important when
you play smaller pools high stakes that
you are reflective in terms of your own

[1:26:00]
you are reflective in terms of your own
shredding you're like okay what are
leaks that I have and how I would go
about exploiting myself in a way so you
can also
see like okay if I will be playing as
myself I would do this
and then you could maybe start to spot
hey other players are doing that so he's
probably trying to exploit me on this

[1:26:16]
probably trying to exploit me on this
tendency that I have I don't want to
necessarily say leak it can also just be
a strategical uh strategical reference
throughout throughout your career maybe
when trying to move up to the stakes
would have been like some of the bigger

[1:26:30]
would have been like some of the bigger
aha moments or like strategical
breakthroughs so you could actually uh
yeah move up
um
I would say
it was probably

[1:26:45]
it was probably
um
I don't know if it was strategical
more or else if it was like
kind of a mental thing just realizing
that okay
like I remember moving up to like 5100

[1:27:01]
like I remember moving up to like 5100
for the first time
and I had enough money to play it pretty
comfortably but I said like wow this is
like 5100 like this is pretty sick but
then I sit down the lineup is the same
lineup is 25.50 I was already doing well

[1:27:17]
lineup is 25.50 I was already doing well
and I said okay I'll just play the game
and then move up to 100 200 and then oh
this is actually a bit of a tougher
lineup and then I would play the game
and I would just be like okay this is

[1:27:30]
and I would just be like okay this is
actually tougher but I can do it like
it's just like I I see some people
moving up the stakes and then they just
feel like ah everyone is so much better
now everybody is going to crush me uh I
I can't play with these guys blah blah

[1:27:47]
I can't play with these guys blah blah
blah and I think this is like the main
point just realizing you are again
playing human beings
they are probably more experienced uh
than you

[1:28:00]
than you
um and they are probably uh a bit
stronger than the players you were
playing
at the lower Stakes
but
you're still playing human beings that
you can beat
um it's not like you are now playing
Five robots and you're just gonna sit

[1:28:16]
Five robots and you're just gonna sit
there and lose uh your 10 to 20 BB 100
and and that's it there's no nothing you
can do about it and I actually see it's
like people moving and I've probably
experienced it myself at some point that
uh yeah you just have to again uh

[1:28:34]
uh yeah you just have to again uh
like you're gonna see a certain thing
let's say you had a spot where like you
thought oh this is like a snapfold on
the river or like oh this is a really
terrible bluffing spot on the river and

[1:28:45]
terrible bluffing spot on the river and
then you would see someone moving up and
you would say ah
in in 20K I have to call this on the
river no but the spot is really bad why
would you call or like this this is a
really bad Bluff nah ah but now I'm at
the bottom of my range so I need to do
this so I need to do that and I think

[1:29:01]
this so I need to do that and I think
they they uh they feel like they need to
now play special or like play uh I don't
know
um
reinvent the game or whatever it is uh
because now they're moving up especially

[1:29:15]
because now they're moving up especially
if it's like to uh to actually like high
stakes and it's not you just need to
play solid you need to have a solid game
plan and of course if people are playing
different than in in 25 50 then 10 20 of
course you're gonna realize that and

[1:29:30]
course you're gonna realize that and
you're gonna make the adjustments but at
first you're just gonna sit there play
your solid game plan and try to adjust
uh within time see see how things go
um I think that's the biggest moment
that's the biggest thing I think about
this kind of stuff

[1:29:46]
this kind of stuff
um yeah it's basically the same
uh probably uh popular listens to the
podcast be like hey I've heard this
before because this has been a red line
throughout many guests in Vietnam uh and
it's it's so weird like the reason why

[1:30:01]
it's it's so weird like the reason why
you were able to move up is because you
were you had for example very solid
approach various other strategy then why
do we feel the need to change it when
you go a level up it makes no sense the
way you played you earned your place at
the higher Stakes so why change it what
for you have been some of the most

[1:30:16]
for you have been some of the most
effective ways to improve your game
yeah
so I'm actually not
the average uh high-stakes guy in a
matter of studying I don't enjoy just

[1:30:33]
matter of studying I don't enjoy just
studying
um
there are faces in my career where I
studied a lot there are still going to
be some of those spaces but uh I would
say my routine I probably study a few

[1:30:46]
say my routine I probably study a few
hours a week but I do just share and
look at a lot of Andy's stories every
day
just from friends and then
this is most of my study these days I
just pick up on codes on Theory Concepts

[1:31:02]
just pick up on codes on Theory Concepts
pretty fast and have like a solid game
plan in general and
then I just try to yeah share and and
view as many hands as possible and

[1:31:15]
view as many hands as possible and
get really good info from people who
play the same games
and that way basically
it's it's basically like studying it's
basically like doing a lot of candy
story reviews
but it's just yeah one-handed at a time

[1:31:33]
but it's just yeah one-handed at a time
yeah I think if you especially obviously
if you have if you have good good inputs
around you right from where from very
good players this uh this is going to be
very effective also I assume that you
pay a lot of attention to for example

[1:31:46]
pay a lot of attention to for example
other very study players I remember for
example in the uh
uh when I was at the peak of my career I
wasn't actually like it sounded a bit
similar obviously I was aware of a lot
of theoretical concept but it's not like
I was spending a lot of time in the
solver I was just mainly talking

[1:32:01]
solver I was just mainly talking
strategy with
fellow fellow poker players sharing
hands but since everyone was in the
silver streets and I was playing against
a lot of guys on top Street you would
see them every time making sure the
moves and be like ah that actually makes
a lot of sense and they maybe got it

[1:32:16]
a lot of sense and they maybe got it
from the solver so indirectly I was also
doing a lot of work but I was processing
a bit different I would see a strategy
and be like ah okay this is quite
interesting I can see what what this
sizing or what this hand is trying to
accomplish and I understand the concept

[1:32:30]
accomplish and I understand the concept
behind it like hey okay let me let me
add this now to my own game and that
would actually sometimes see the same
person who I then got that concept from
or at least he was starting to apply it
to this game I then saw him misapplying
it basically he just got it from the
from the solver and just started copying
it it was like wait wait but I

[1:32:45]
it it was like wait wait but I
understood that it would have been an
annoying spot in this situation but what
you're doing now this makes no sense
you're just now copying what the solver
told you to do but I feel like you're
kind of misunderstanding the concept
behind it so often by experiencing and I
think this also the value of playing
against uh tough opponents they will put

[1:33:01]
against uh tough opponents they will put
you in tough spots and you this is
actually quite an annoying situation and
you can then learn from it like okay how
did how did he build a strategy that now
booted me in a tough situation and you
can then try to learn from it so
basically I would almost say playing

[1:33:15]
basically I would almost say playing
against very good players
and paying attention to them and trying
to learn from them is is like a Step
Beyond Consulting the solvers
if that makes sense yeah I agree I
definitely agree
and yeah everything you said makes

[1:33:30]
and yeah everything you said makes
perfect sense
I'm very curious you already mentioned
especially I think during the matching
games you were you had very solid
routines I'm curious like what does a
day-to-day or week to week in the life
of uh Barrett grinding look like

[1:33:46]
of uh Barrett grinding look like
so it changes a lot
like really a lot
um there would be certain times that I
wake up
uh very early in the morning like six to
probably not six six was very extreme

[1:34:01]
probably not six six was very extreme
but let's say in general like 7 to 10 AM
or something
um
just wake up like for example the last
routine before
uh my live experiences recently was

[1:34:17]
uh my live experiences recently was
basically waking up
um pretty early just uh
it's basically uh you I don't know if
you guys heard of uberman
so basically the Uber one morning
routine of just waking up uh immediately

[1:34:32]
routine of just waking up uh immediately
going out to the Sun for like a walk so
I would just take I don't really do a
lot of workouts so I just I I was
walking around a lot and the weather was
pretty great at the spring so I was just

[1:34:45]
pretty great at the spring so I was just
walking around for like an hour or like
90 minutes
and then getting back getting like cold
shower and then like only then get like
something to eat
um then basically what happens is if

[1:35:02]
um then basically what happens is if
it's time to play then I uh if like I
have no other commitments or something
that I've uh scheduled to do this day
then I would just open the computer
see open the lobbies see if there are
any games running and if I feel like it

[1:35:17]
any games running and if I feel like it
I will play uh if I still feel like it I
can like open sit and I don't know do
something until something shows up
uh but life is pretty chill I'm not
really grinding like

[1:35:31]
really grinding like
big time or anything like it
[Music]
um
I think my average this year at home is
like four hours a day or something which
is uh for me it's at least for me it's
not a lot
um so yeah just chilling with friends uh

[1:35:48]
um so yeah just chilling with friends uh
like
ordering food going to some restaurants
doing all this kind of stuff
um
yeah like
studying here and there like again like

[1:36:02]
studying here and there like again like
not super often maybe maybe really like
a few hours a week like three to four
hours something like that
and
yeah there is nothing really uh

[1:36:16]
yeah there is nothing really uh
special going on just like
that that's basically it
um
and then there would be times where like
I wake up super late because I'm playing
mtts for now like like today for example

[1:36:32]
mtts for now like like today for example
um
where the
there is a series going on on GG and I
decided I'm gonna put like three to four
sessions a week
um and then I go to sleep super late I
wake up super late uh

[1:36:47]
wake up super late uh
and basically do similar things but just
much later trying to enjoy the the end
of the summer going to the beach a lot
uh again just chilling with friends
watching some TV

[1:37:01]
watching some TV
nothing too special
before you play do you have any uh
specific rituals you go to like a
pre-session routine or it's just oh the
games are on now I I dive in or do you
at least take some time to think about
okay uh what whatever what I have to

[1:37:15]
okay uh what whatever what I have to
focus on
it's kind of funny because during the
for me it's kind of uh extreme doing the
Imagine King games uh in Israel uh time
zone every day around like 6 a.m or like

[1:37:31]
zone every day around like 6 a.m or like
5 30 a.m he would play his first session
and basically what I did is I would go
to sleep very early like maximum at like
1am
and
which is really unlike me

[1:37:47]
which is really unlike me
um but even sometimes like 11 to 12 will
just go to bed and instantly fall asleep
because I was waking up very early and
then I would just wake up like 6 A.M
open my phone open the GG app if if he's

[1:38:01]
open my phone open the GG app if if he's
sitting in there usually this is the
time where the table wasn't even full
because everybody is sleeping and I
would just instantly sit in
uh you can sit out for like seven
minutes until they uh remove you so I

[1:38:15]
minutes until they uh remove you so I
was just brushing my teeth washing my
face going to my desk switching to my
computer app and stop playing and I
think it happened a lot
some people it would be disastrous for
them for me it's just natural I don't
know I can just do it I can do the

[1:38:31]
know I can just do it I can do the
switch very quickly so in general I'm
not the kind of guy who has like
a warm-up or like a ritual or anything
like that uh uh but I've seen that like
for example before a day of playing like

[1:38:46]
for example before a day of playing like
I think like life is different for me
because online I just sit next to my
desk I'm so used to it and it's so
comfortable and there is no pressure for
me because I don't know it's just my
normal thing but then when I go play
live I feel like it's so much different

[1:39:00]
live I feel like it's so much different
you just sit there play one end at a
time like 20 25 ends an hour and it's
super long and and it's it's uh it's
much more stressful
um like when you're going all in for

[1:39:15]
um like when you're going all in for
like 20K live or online it's completely
different from some for some reason
maybe it's also a matter of experience
or something but at least that's how I
experience it
um
and then uh
when playing live I would definitely

[1:39:30]
when playing live I would definitely
have a much healthier ritual or like
routine and for playing online I'm
definitely trying to do more healthy
things just for my lifestyle but I don't
feel like it has like a huge effect on
my game it probably still has an effect
on my game uh but I don't feel like it's

[1:39:48]
on my game uh but I don't feel like it's
at it's as big as it is maybe for
different people
um but yeah that's just that's just how
I approach it
yeah for example if I talk about myself
let's say I'm aware of certain uh

[1:40:01]
let's say I'm aware of certain uh
certain leaks that have a certain
tendencies that I want to get rid of if
I just sit down start Play Nine out of
10 times yeah I will just sit down and
be my myself which includes the leaks
right that I actually want to fix so for
myself personally before I I start I

[1:40:15]
myself personally before I I start I
definitely have to reinforce like okay
these are things that I would like to
change so that when the moment comes up
I can recognize that my default State
wants to wants to do the thing that it
always does which I identified is
probably some optimal so then at least
before I play I will have certain hand

[1:40:31]
before I play I will have certain hand
marked for example that show hey this is
the preferably the concept in action how
I would like to do it but you know
especially if the leak I can find a lot
of examples of where I will get wrong so
usually in the beginning it's wrong and
then as soon as I did it a couple times
right I'll replace the wrong for right I

[1:40:46]
right I'll replace the wrong for right I
think that just works a little bit a bit
better like to reinforce what you want
to do more of instead of to remind
yourself of what you don't want to do I
find that a bit more a bit more
effective and and then just ride out for
myself okay this is what I'm going to

[1:41:00]
myself okay this is what I'm going to
focus on and then I notice when the
spots come up first of all I noticed I'm
just more focused like I'm looking for
these situations where I can improve and
then when they do come up I'm like ah
yes naturally intuitively I want to do
this but my intuition is clearly biased
towards the leak here so I definitely
noticed for myself

[1:41:16]
noticed for myself
that if I don't
sit down and kind of refocus that I'll
go and autopilot and if the autopilot
then depends like what you're out
apparently your games uh your autopilot
game is very solid that you can just
wake up and and play and play good
straight away but I think again I think

[1:41:31]
straight away but I think again I think
that's also someone that would touch out
throughout this conversation everyone is
different and you have to kind of find
out what works for you you also
mentioned I think earlier as well when
going from online to life that you need
some time to adjust I think you said
like two weeks to adjust to life and you

[1:41:46]
like two weeks to adjust to life and you
also mentioned that you find life
actually more stressful even though it's
only 25 hands an hour uh what a kind of
the adjustments you have to make when
going from online to live play
so
most of the time going from online to

[1:42:03]
most of the time going from online to
live means
um that you're gonna play uh
a much softer field and a different kind
of field so
basically what happens is again like all

[1:42:17]
basically what happens is again like all
your kind of like beliefs and and meta
game that you've been practicing for the
last one to three months or whatever
since the last livestock you've had
um
are not valid anymore like some of them

[1:42:30]
are not valid anymore like some of them
of course are gonna still be valid but
you're gonna have to make some
differences you're gonna have to adjust
again and for me
also another thing is just performance
uh so if I sit down and play live for

[1:42:46]
uh so if I sit down and play live for
three months like I just did I feel like
in if you take the performance I had
during like the the gap of like 30 like
day 30 to day 60 out of those 90 days it
was probably at its peak both like

[1:43:02]
was probably at its peak both like
mentally physically uh and like just
strategy wise and if you look like at
the the first uh I don't know two weeks
or something or like maybe even the last

[1:43:15]
or something or like maybe even the last
week where I was already exhausted
um
I think uh there is a there is like
maybe like a 10 DB 100 win rate
difference between those two guys and

[1:43:30]
difference between those two guys and
for me uh yeah I guess that the the
adjustments are just yeah paying much
more attention to every hand going on at
the table
um which has in online you don't have to
do that because oh there was a big pot

[1:43:45]
do that because oh there was a big pot
and you just pay attention on the river
you just click the replay button you can
just see what happened and take your
note or whatever or like see if the
recreational just is now tilted or
whatever and live you just miss the hand
you have no idea what's going on anymore
and I often see that like playing live I

[1:44:01]
and I often see that like playing live I
would play a table
I'm still definitely far from being 100
focused and paying attention to every
end because that's just impossible
um but I would often see that like
another regular is playing uh uh
recreational in a very bad way and he's

[1:44:17]
recreational in a very bad way and he's
that just means one of two things one is
he hasn't been paying attention or two
he has been paying attention but he's
not making the right adjustments so for
me I feel like whenever I'm going from
online to live it takes me like one to

[1:44:31]
online to live it takes me like one to
two weeks and one of the things that a
friend suggested and I I kind of like
doing is the
I don't always do it but
um I think it's very good to do it once
in a while that like you just finished
the livestock and and you have like

[1:44:47]
the livestock and and you have like
everything is fresh in your mind just
take a notebook and write down like all
of the things you could have done better
whether it's on get on on the felt or
off the field and then like whenever
you're gonna go for a life play again

[1:45:01]
you're gonna go for a life play again
you're gonna do that you're just gonna
look at that and or like let's say in
the beginning you feel like in the first
one to two weeks you're you're having
some leaks that show up you you punt too
much or you I don't know you miss uh

[1:45:15]
much or you I don't know you miss uh
calculate the pot or I don't know
anything you you you feel like you're
you're struggling with you just write it
down and then all of those things before
the next stop they're gonna be so so
much uh so helpful for you
um even if you don't do anything about

[1:45:31]
um even if you don't do anything about
about it just read for 10 minutes what
you wrote down it's gonna be uh
uh so good for you
um so yeah that's I guess that's one
thing and and the same thing goes to
online you just go back and you haven't

[1:45:46]
online you just go back and you haven't
done any Theory work for for a while
even if it's only like two weeks it
matters because you yeah I like to call
you play like uh online is like real
poker and live is like not really really
popular a lot of the time

[1:46:02]
popular a lot of the time
um at least not uh like below like 10K
or something
um and yeah then you just have to
for me this was the most uh the most
important stuff

[1:46:16]
important stuff
Yeah so basically when you're saying
that if I understood correctly it's for
example the things you take in
consideration when making a decision if
you play three four-handed against Kevin
Linus it's obviously going to be way
different than if you're in Vegas
playing as a guy with a cowboy hat

[1:46:31]
playing as a guy with a cowboy hat
that's kind of what you're saying right
we don't have to consider about yes this
hand I should probably check back you
know balance my range here and there
yeah we're playing against a guy with a
Cowboy head in Vegas maybe you should
just play your hand in a vacuum that's
kind of what you're saying yeah and then
let's say you're paying a hundred

[1:46:47]
let's say you're paying a hundred
percent attention to Linus and Kevin
playing
first of all I've already played like
hundreds of thousands of hands with them
um and I have an idea of how they are
playing and even if I don't I can just
off the table just open my poker tracker

[1:47:02]
off the table just open my poker tracker
and go over hands and see what happened
whereas if you're now playing the guy
with the card with a cowboy and you're
likely to only play once in your
lifetime and he has made a certain play
that can change your strategy in a hand

[1:47:17]
that can change your strategy in a hand
you're gonna have against him I I really
believe that it can change a decision
let's say like the guy jams 40 BBB on
the river all in and you now face a
decision with a bluff catcher and you're
sitting there and you're thinking

[1:47:31]
sitting there and you're thinking
like okay like what does Fury say let's
say Theory says this is a free big blind
call uh but but the guy is the guy with
a cowboy hat what is he up to and then
like other than him being with a cowboy
hat you know nothing then you maybe you

[1:47:47]
hat you know nothing then you maybe you
can if you are a very experienced live
player maybe there could be like
lifetails or anything but if there isn't
anything like that you're just sitting
there and trying to think about uh The
Meta of the spot or whatever but now
you're just playing live with a guy and

[1:48:00]
you're just playing live with a guy and
you have no idea how he's playing so if
it's the first hand that he's playing on
the table then you are unlucky
but if it's uh if it's if he has already
been playing for two or three or eight
hours and you haven't been paying
attention whereas another guy has been

[1:48:15]
attention whereas another guy has been
paying attention maybe you make the call
down and lose 40 BB uh and and the other
guy makes the uh the fold and and he
basically just saved uh 40 BB
um or like another example like you you

[1:48:30]
um or like another example like you you
make the fold and he shows the bluff for
and another guy makes the call it's
basically a 40 BB difference and it can
even be bigger when it's uh more deep
stack so I really believe in that
approach like obviously in most
scenarios in poker like you can't really
say ah it's like zero or a hundred Davey

[1:48:47]
say ah it's like zero or a hundred Davey
is going to be somewhere in between
right
um but I really believe that especially
live playing certain guys you can say
like okay there is 99 this guy has the
nuts so I just have to fold the third
nuts because there is not much I can do

[1:49:02]
nuts because there is not much I can do
here
um
also because the way they approach the
game like you said there there are two
different games the way they approach
the game is also so different than
online where it's going to be less
extreme usually because you know people

[1:49:16]
extreme usually because you know people
might I don't know rent them out they
don't want to do it but you know they'll
do 20 of the time in life it's just like
the way that people also construct their
ranges it's very that will very much
lead them towards always having
something and never having the other
where online you know things are more

[1:49:31]
where online you know things are more
randomized so the the EV difference is
going to be less big
yeah yeah exactly and also like uh one
Euro like let's say you are recruiting
even a recreational player and you're
sitting there online playing a few

[1:49:46]
sitting there online playing a few
tables and you now lost a huge hand
you know yeah you're probably likely to
get tilted and and now I would look out
for for this guy and probably be ready
for him to to be more likely to spew but
then if it's live and it just lost a big

[1:50:01]
then if it's live and it just lost a big
part then
that makes a huge difference and if you
don't pay attention then yeah like I
again like I'm far from perfect I I can
sit there obviously and then look at uh
you know I would get a hand I would look

[1:50:15]
you know I would get a hand I would look
at it just drop my phone down because I
was uh sending a message or something
and then I would uh look at the hand
open it and then this recreational would
flatten and I would say ah how does he
have only like one third of a starting
stack what happened I mean these things
happen it's okay it's it's again like

[1:50:31]
happen it's okay it's it's again like
you you need to acknowledge that you're
not going to be focused 100 of the time
and that's fine yeah so but your
attention should be at least listen try
to at least pay some attention so we can
get some information about how these
players are playing yeah yeah exactly
and for example actually this this

[1:50:46]
and for example actually this this
summer I was actually in uh in Vegas
actually we we saw each other there as
well this was the first time I played
life in probably
10 years or so or at least the first
time that I went to Vegas in 10 years
and I was actually very surprised with
how regulars how little people were

[1:51:01]
how regulars how little people were
paying attention at the table I'm also
more like listen when I play Live I'm
gonna try to pay attention because any
Showdown can tell me a lot about how
especially like I said people life don't
randomize [ __ ] it's not like they
randomly oh yeah he would do the 80 of

[1:51:15]
randomly oh yeah he would do the 80 of
the time but 20 of the time he checks
and he's not bluffing that hand or you
know he's always bluffing the hand or
even like in spots where people should
usually never bet and now suddenly have
a betting race okay so you have betting
ranges in these type of spots what does
that say about your checking rates next
time well okay next time when you check

[1:51:31]
time well okay next time when you check
here I'm gonna pound quite a lot of
pressure for example these kind of
things you have to pay attention I
remember actually it was one hand where
three fishes sit down oh no two fish sat
down and one of the fish stood up and
was basically coaching the other two
fishes that's quite an interesting

[1:51:45]
fishes that's quite an interesting
Dynamic and then there was one wreck who
I know is alive wreck he was sitting
there sunglasses headphones
but these guys you know they came in
they were chatty and due to the cheddar
you could notice okay this guy on my
right he was playing pretending but he

[1:52:01]
right he was playing pretending but he
he was just looking to get his stacking
at some point right he was not gonna
play there for an hour and just grind
yeah at some point the guy the guy opens
he has been a bit on the tire side but
to be fair he was just it was about it
was gonna happen I'm and I play no life

[1:52:15]
was gonna happen I'm and I play no life
no life and I could feel at something's
gonna happen so the guy triples off in
position on the board that has two sixes
on it and the life wreck he actually had
a six and he went to the tank on the
river and he ended up in my opinion Slow
Rolling the fish quite hard because the

[1:52:30]
Rolling the fish quite hard because the
fish has had nothing uh and then
afterwards also someone said yeah he
didn't listen to what was going on
because he was with his headphones so I
was like but that's a huge mistake like
these guys sit down you have to kind of
you know chat with them and kind of feel
the vibe at the table and for that you

[1:52:46]
the vibe at the table and for that you
cannot wear headphones in my opinion but
still when I saw majority people are
with music in and like you miss so much
information that
could
yeah that that could alter the way you
would play your hands I was just also in
general surprise with how much

[1:53:00]
general surprise with how much
information was giving away at the table
even though I'm not experienced but
especially with timing and stuff it's
like all the regulars were just snapped
this snap that and then when they would
think then it would say so because every
time they step check it's like okay well
no more nuts in your range that was kind

[1:53:15]
no more nuts in your range that was kind
of every time every time what would
happen I was actually very surprised
about uh about the live poker but yeah
it's like I said it's a completely
completely different game completely
different yeah so what do you see for
example if you you play a lot of life
and you see for example a person like

[1:53:30]
and you see for example a person like
myself online kid coming to life
whatever it's like classic mistakes that
these online players make when they come
play live
um
I would I would assume there were gonna
be some physical mistakes
um I'm probably not the kind of guy to

[1:53:47]
um I'm probably not the kind of guy to
um to give the input on that just
because I'm not super experienced myself
um I'm somewhat aware and I'm doing some
work about that part of the game but
definitely far from like the best guys

[1:54:03]
definitely far from like the best guys
um
I I guess it's just like uh game plan
basically you just need to have a
completely different game plan
um I don't want to dive too much in into
the strategy of

[1:54:16]
the strategy of
how and and why and whatever but the
game is like I said it's just so much
different
um you just really need to have like uh
you you need to figure out where you are
what you're trying to achieve like on

[1:54:30]
what you're trying to achieve like on
day one on day two you just pay
attention to what people are doing or
like you are playing a live cash game
then what is the matter how is it
different how is the spec type stack
size different
okay like you just need to sit there
play solid and pay attention for a few
days if it's the first time you you get

[1:54:46]
days if it's the first time you you get
there and then you again like if you pay
enough attention you you start realizing
what you can do
um and I think whenever I see people who
do that they can be much worse players

[1:55:00]
do that they can be much worse players
than other really good online players
but they are gonna have really good
results and I can see really good online
players coming and just going around
because they have no clue of what's
going on and that's that's definitely
something that I've seen uh going on
yeah especially because because there's

[1:55:15]
yeah especially because because there's
way more spots where people either
always have it and and
they'd never have it for example so the
EV like you said of a decision that you
make is going to be way greater whereas
the online kid will have less experience
and he would probably project his own

[1:55:30]
and he would probably project his own
range onto his opponent to a certain
degree
but like I I for example I was aware of
these things before I before I went in I
went to play live for like two weeks I
was like well I never play live so
certain things are going to happen I
already agreed okay there's got to be a
couple moments where I destroyed the

[1:55:46]
couple moments where I destroyed the
wrong [ __ ] chip obviously happened a
couple times where I was only what I
called but I wanted to three bet you
know or like a completely miscalculated
size of the pot these are things you
know that that are going to happen but
especially trying to not project
uh yeah your knowledge onto your

[1:56:01]
uh yeah your knowledge onto your
opponent that was definitely a big one
that I had top of mind like these games
this is this is different poker like you
said
yeah yeah and like another thing that
comes to mind is about what you said
about listening and I remember an

[1:56:16]
about listening and I remember an
extreme thing that some guy at my table
like rich guy was like probably like
500k dollar watch uh like uh he has like
jewelry he looks like extremely rich and
he looks like he doesn't give any [ __ ]

[1:56:30]
he looks like he doesn't give any [ __ ]
about what's going on and he basically
was talking to his friend on the phone
and was telling him he's going to dinner
with him at 7 pm and the day ends at
like 12 or something so
like this tells you that if he still has
a stack by 6 30 I mean he's going to

[1:56:47]
a stack by 6 30 I mean he's going to
give it away yeah if it's not like a
huge stack maybe then it changes his
plan but he's probably gonna give it
away and I think he gave it away much
earlier but
um yeah like you can pick up on Extreme
things I actually I really enjoy uh

[1:57:01]
things I actually I really enjoy uh
listening to music while playing it
really gets me uh into a really good uh
uh mindset I think so I probably missed
a bunch of stuff but I do pay attention
to showdowns and like you said if

[1:57:15]
to showdowns and like you said if
there's like a big conversation going on
or if there are like fun people I would
often just socialize and see what's
going on not only because at least take
out one earpiece so you could kind of
yeah the better Both Worlds yeah I get
that yeah it's also part of the fun of

[1:57:31]
that yeah it's also part of the fun of
the game the socializing with new people
it's listening not only yeah that was
also the reason I was there like if I
want to listen to music while playing I
I'll stay here beyond my computer right
I'm here in Vegas I want to have I want
to have fun I want to chat with the cow
Cowboy Bill next to me you know yeah

further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode

[2:00:00]
goodness in today's episode
uh you you also have a lot of experience
coaching in your experience working with
with players while coaching them what
are some common leaks that you
constantly see and how do you go about
fixing them
I wouldn't say I have a lot of

[2:00:17]
I wouldn't say I have a lot of
experience coaching I have some
um
I would definitely say uh
uh one of the big things I see is uh I'm

[2:00:30]
uh one of the big things I see is uh I'm
not sure it's a leak but it's just a
thing that people they talk about the
game in one way but then in practice
they play differently there seems to be
like a big performance gap between their
knowledge and their ability to perform

[2:00:45]
knowledge and their ability to perform
and I would say
it probably comes from a bunch of mental
stuff but it's something that I I
consistently see and it's it's very
interesting to dive into this and and
how you can change it because I would

[2:01:00]
how you can change it because I would
imagine uh the things that affect it is
just like uh stress uh it's uh how you
deal with losing hands or like the
session began pretty bad or like you got
the worst River in the deck like all

[2:01:15]
the worst River in the deck like all
this kind of stuff or like you made a
mistake or like how you deal with time
Banks like some people myself included
the more time I have the more I would
heal relaxed even if I need three
seconds to make uh a decision at some uh

[2:01:32]
seconds to make uh a decision at some uh
in some spots I would still uh
feel a lot more comfortable to do it
when I have like 200 seconds time bank
or like no time banking life rather than
having like a 30 second shot clock or

[2:01:45]
having like a 30 second shot clock or
whatever
um so that's another thing
or like people who play too many tables
all this kind of stuff just it's not
really like strategy leaks but just like
I guess mental and and uh

[2:02:00]
I guess mental and and uh
and the management leak that I see often
and I'm not 100 sure how to deal with
them I guess again it's just like a
matter of like trying to realize for
each person where they come from where
these gaps come from and what you can do
about it all right then I actually I

[2:02:16]
about it all right then I actually I
wanted to touch on uh the the projection
and the performance aspect that you said
I wish we I wish we would know someone
who's very good at uh performance mental
game mindset oh there he is Mr Mr Adam
Carmichael this is actually also one of

[2:02:30]
Carmichael this is actually also one of
the reasons why I teamed up with Adam
um in in our own coaching program
because in my experience as well but
also my experience with coaching players
the performance aspect the mental game
aspect like I always say I can teach you
and you probably have the same

[2:02:45]
and you probably have the same
experience our job as technical coaches
is to explain people how to think about
poker how the game works
but then how much of that knowledge you
can apply to the table and how much
access you have to that knowledge that
really depends on like you're mental

[2:03:00]
really depends on like you're mental
game your mindset how certain things
trigger you at the table your ability to
perform and that's I think where Adam
comes in So Adam what are in your
opinion some common performance leaks
and also tip for Barrack he said I don't
really know what how to handle with this

[2:03:16]
really know what how to handle with this
type of students that have these kind of
problems what uh what should we advise
them jump in the cool show where I heard
already but other than that
yeah I like the way uh Barrack described
it and he talked about this performance
gap between the knowledge of the player

[2:03:30]
gap between the knowledge of the player
and what they're building able to
execute in game so first of all we're
seeing that it's not so much a strategic
physical errors there's a gap between
what they're executing game and then
also the factors that lead to that so
you mentioned stress you mentioned
emotion you mentioned like a focus and I
think like this is so hard to like give

[2:03:46]
think like this is so hard to like give
a kind of one could approach solution
but it's understanding that humans are
very complex and we have certain things
that cause triggers responses and for us
to act suboptimally so as you imagine
stress the big one and probably the most
important one is emotions how we handle

[2:04:01]
important one is emotions how we handle
emotions how we handle our interacting
with our environments what thoughts are
coming up and what emotions are causing
us to deviate strategies we've also got
coding the biases which are coming in
which maybe get us to a DBS strategy so
I think rather than coming up with a one

[2:04:16]
I think rather than coming up with a one
solution for each player it's
understanding building awareness so it
says a gap so say various kind of
students and he realizes this guy is
amazing and Theory amazing of the tables
but his results suck all right so we've
got to get there's a gap between who
this guy could be and what he's

[2:04:30]
this guy could be and what he's
performing in game then when he starts
detecting okay where are the errors
coming from and understand that a person
like his lifestyle what he's doing how
he's dealing with stress is a good
starting point but also like how he's
processing information how he's dealing
with triggers I think what we've covered

[2:04:46]
with triggers I think what we've covered
so far in this conversation is actually
a lot of the work that he needs to do
kind of if you watch it they're going to
start this podcast and barracks and kind
of Journey from Degen to a kind of more
mentally calm high-stakes player he's
remember this process of building
awareness around the triggers that cause

[2:05:01]
awareness around the triggers that cause
responses that he's not happy with and
that's generally what's happening with a
lot of these players they're getting
triggered by situations and then acting
suboptimally so it's built in a kind of
toolkit of awareness whilst you're
playing what are the main situations
that cause you to be triggered for a lot

[2:05:16]
that cause you to be triggered for a lot
of players it's making mistakes it's
losing it's going down swings which
leads to self-doubt frustration and
things that cause big deviation of their
strategy so trying to really understand
the player and what they're struggling
with what they're suffering through and

[2:05:30]
with what they're suffering through and
trying to give them a toolkit to deal
with that because the long-term solution
in my opinion is going through your Port
career building more and more toolkits
so that you can deal with more and more
situations so Barack for example like
right now he's got a whole host of
toolkits to deal with adversity to deal

[2:05:45]
toolkits to deal with adversity to deal
with challenges deal with emotions
because these things are needed because
no matter how good you are a poker the
pain is going to come as we've talked
about today and they're gonna have
challenges over and over so I think it's
identifying all those kind of factors
that cause drops and performance another
big one is focus like how well players

[2:06:00]
big one is focus like how well players
can focus this can be down to energy
levels can be down lifestyle factors but
some players just don't payment of
attention again as Barracks talked about
the importance of being switched on for
live but also for online you've got to
be there fully attentive during your
sessions to maximize your ability so

[2:06:16]
sessions to maximize your ability so
yeah so much fun pack I think it's the
main thing is going down the Avenue of
exploration building awareness and then
trying to come with toolkits to uh to
solve all those problems
what I'm really interested to know about
you but Barack uh you mentioned
something earlier which I thought which
I highlighted a few times playing these

[2:06:30]
I highlighted a few times playing these
higher Stakes games and almost like
believe that you belong there and you're
kind of frame of reference was these
guys are just human and I don't need to
uh fear them I can hold my own against
them or even trying to exploit these now
I can see like how that's an amazing

[2:06:45]
I can see like how that's an amazing
mindset I have what I want to know is
how did you instill that mindset in
yourself how do you build that
confidence that when you sit down with
lioness Kevin other players who are
really world-class players some of the
best in the world how do you keep that
belief strong in tough environments

[2:07:00]
belief strong in tough environments
which are you might not have the the
track record at that moment to back up
your belief
so basically I think
like I said before I'm very
uh aware of like results and obviously

[2:07:17]
uh aware of like results and obviously
results can be mistaking
even in
even if there's like a a certain sample
size I wouldn't say big sample size but
even like it a medium amount of sample

[2:07:31]
even like it a medium amount of sample
size they can definitely uh not be
correct uh to what they would be if they
were if you were to play one million
hands for example
um but it's a mix of like having good
results and like Renee said just having

[2:07:48]
results and like Renee said just having
a good feel like you're feeling like
you're in control you're feeling like uh
yeah I got this like I I see the spots
where I'm making the money
um there are definitely spots where I'm
losing money

[2:08:00]
losing money
um but overall like I feel like I'm I'm
doing well and and uh my game plan is
solid for this game
and
if you take that and the results into
accountability then this leads me to uh

[2:08:17]
accountability then this leads me to uh
being able to play it again because
obviously even if I feel in control and
whatever and I'm gonna just drop the two
binds every day at some point I will
have to to stop playing because if just
consistently I'm just gonna lose 60

[2:08:31]
consistently I'm just gonna lose 60
binds a month then I will be out of
money very quickly
um but if I keep playing and see that
like over like one two three years I'm
I'm making money even if in some of the
toughest games it's gonna be very little

[2:08:45]
toughest games it's gonna be very little
money or like even slightly losing
um then then it's fine by me there is
also an added EV of just like let's say
you're playing like a break even game
but uh you're playing a really tough
game and even if you're not gonna

[2:09:00]
game and even if you're not gonna
analyze the hands and and only analyze
like three or five hands every session
that's already a big win because those
three or five hands our hands were
you're probably really really struggled
or like uh you found out something
really big because if you play those

[2:09:16]
really big because if you play those
tough opponents then they they get you
into those notes very often
um
yeah so that's basically how I see it
yeah it's almost frame and those really
challenging games as learning
opportunities chances to grow get better

[2:09:30]
opportunities chances to grow get better
what in your opinion is the most
important skill for a poker poker player
to learn or a trade to acquire let's use
this question relative to maybe a
mid-stakes player who has aspirations of
playing High sticks most important skill
a player shift alone

[2:09:47]
a player shift alone
I think I will just State a few
uh general ones we've probably talked
about all of them but it's just like
um
doing work on yourself both mentally as

[2:10:00]
doing work on yourself both mentally as
a poker player and as a person because I
often feel like poker is really like
life there are many many similarities
and I kind of feel myself growing in
both aspects
simultaneously which is kind of cool

[2:10:16]
simultaneously which is kind of cool
um and there is yeah there is much
to take from each one of uh
like from life to Poker and from poker
life I really feel the threat so there
is that there is a management which
means bankroll management which means uh

[2:10:31]
means bankroll management which means uh
uh game selection which is really really
important
um it means who you're getting involved
with
um so
let's say you have a set of friends from
poker who are like they keep dragging

[2:10:46]
poker who are like they keep dragging
you down if you know what I mean like
they they keep just bringing negative
emotions they keep uh yeah they don't
really add anything to your circle they
don't do anything good to you
um then maybe maybe it's not the best

[2:11:02]
um then maybe maybe it's not the best
friendship for you
um
I can tell like you you really need a
like a good environment
um that's another thing
a lot of I guess just trying to be uh

[2:11:17]
a lot of I guess just trying to be uh
uh consistent with studying and not just
paying attention to solvers also paying
attention to like meta game or certain
opponents or anything like that just
really trying to

[2:11:31]
really trying to
um to build up your uh
skill set not only around solvers
because those can take you only uh so
far and
yeah I guess that's mostly what comes to

[2:11:46]
yeah I guess that's mostly what comes to
mind
how does the player start to build a
good environment of like-minded or even
better players themselves around them
it's always a common trait we see when
we interview players that they generally
the high stakes have got a really good

[2:12:00]
the high stakes have got a really good
PA group of awesome players they're
speaking with but a lot of players might
be listening might not have many players
around who they can talk strategy with
or progress with so for yourself how did
you start to uh acquire more high
quality players in your peer group what
were some of the main things that were

[2:12:15]
were some of the main things that were
important for you
first of all I feel like it's much
Beyond poker it's just like
I believe there is some luck to it just
like
you know when someone I don't know he

[2:12:30]
you know when someone I don't know he
met the love of his wife of his life or
someone met the guy who brought him into
this startup company which he sold for
one billion or I don't know like because
he was in the right place in the right
time or he grew up in the right place or
like anything like that you can see so

[2:12:46]
like anything like that you can see so
many examples of that I guess it's just
life variance right and then it's just
also like
a lot of time uh people connect with
each other not because of Poker like I I
can see like let's say in Israel we have

[2:13:02]
can see like let's say in Israel we have
like I don't know a few different groups
of uh non-regulars and
everyone is friend with everyone but
they would be like those three four five
guys who are really good friends and

[2:13:15]
guys who are really good friends and
then another group of those in another
group and yeah I I'm not really sure
what connects between uh all of those
people but it's just like you you meet
someone at the poker table or like
online and then you meet him at a poker
table and then

[2:13:30]
table and then
one day it either becomes friendship or
not and
um I guess
for me like it kind of happened for both
ways they were like my closest poker
friends they were also they were really

[2:13:46]
friends they were also they were really
good people and pretty good poker
players and they were really helpful
like I said with mental stuff for me and
management stuff and anything like that
they were good with strategy stuff for
me that it's it's basically like again I

[2:14:01]
me that it's it's basically like again I
I can say I'm very lucky in that kind of
uh manner but uh yeah not entirely sure
how to answer that because it's just
like I feel like it just happened
um yeah so I don't know it's I feel like

[2:14:16]
um yeah so I don't know it's I feel like
you definitely have control over people
you don't want in your life that's what
I can tell you and you have to realize
like okay this guy
is just he's he's a friend I like him
he's a good guy but he has like negative

[2:14:32]
he's a good guy but he has like negative
uh impact on me and he has like uh he
brings nothing to the table and I'm not
saying you should be friends with people
only if they do bring something to the
table I'm just saying if someone is bad
for you then you should either like cut

[2:14:46]
for you then you should either like cut
him loose or uh
I don't know give him like less
attention or anything like that and it's
not always easy
um yeah but yeah I don't know there
would be like certain uh people I would

[2:15:01]
would be like certain uh people I would
just stay away from like I would meet
someone at the poker table or I don't
know where he's also a poker player but
I would feel like I don't know it's a
bit toxic he's a bit uh uh bad
influencer though and I would just I

[2:15:16]
influencer though and I would just I
would I can like the guy and I can be
his friend but I will just not be his
close friend
um yeah he's not gonna be my go-to guy
on a day-to-day basis or something like
that
um so yeah that's the way I see it

[2:15:30]
um so yeah that's the way I see it
yeah I think you have much more control
of the people you don't let in compared
to if you let in but I've also thought
like all the people who reach their high
stakes in particular all have really
good people around them and they can't
just all be getting lucky like always
luckily happened to get to the right
people and it's just the kind of
survival ship confirmation bias kind of

[2:15:46]
survival ship confirmation bias kind of
thing going on I think there's a lot of
factors that go on I think one is like
attracts like and when you're on a kind
of path in a really obsessive path to
become the best at what you do you
realize there's another kind of other
underground people who are also on that
path and you'll generally connect with

[2:16:00]
path and you'll generally connect with
them in some way some sort of Laws of
Attraction the University of stuff going
on but we generally like this attract
like and you'll meet these people at a
livestock or you'll chat them online or
you'll have a coaching session with them
and you just connect with them just
resonate really really high frequency
because you guys are on the same path I
think that's a really big one next one I

[2:16:16]
think that's a really big one next one I
think is really important is
um being valuable valuable people
generally look for the valuable people
so if you become a valuable person once
your skills were solvers your skills of
sharing knowledge just you're generally
trying to help other people generally
other valuable people attract themselves
to you and you try them so there's some

[2:16:31]
to you and you try them so there's some
sort of synergy going on there where
these people who like yourself who reach
high sticks have really good people
around them obviously you've got good
personality as well there's an element
of us humans like people who we like
solicit big which is hard to quantify
but I think there's some things that
you're doing right that lead to that

[2:16:46]
you're doing right that lead to that
kind of trending towards I think from a
lot of other podcasts we've got trained
in towards happiness trending towards a
good environment around you I think
these factors matter and yeah hopefully
those who are listening in the process
of building their own peer groups and

[2:17:00]
of building their own peer groups and
it's one of those things well I think
when you're spend a lot of time with
people you're going to like each other
I'm sure your study partners the people
you spend the most time with who you
tend to you like them as people as well
yes they're very valuable yes they've
got good skills but you've got this kind
of synergy between your personalities
which is also important for for learning

[2:17:16]
which is also important for for learning
and growing together as well I want to
know uh looking back in your career I
know you're still very young lots of
ahead of you looking back in your career
is there any moments that have been the
most enjoyable for you or the most
enjoyable theories that you can reflect
on
yeah definitely I think uh

[2:17:33]
yeah definitely I think uh
I think one of them I've mentioned was
the
basically having success at the life
felt for the first time I really
remember that time

[2:17:46]
remember that time
uh
I don't remember like there are gonna be
many many hands and and things that I
don't remember about my poker career but
um
like actually like some some even big
achievements that I wouldn't uh remember

[2:18:00]
achievements that I wouldn't uh remember
like just like that but
winning that 400 at the win for 30k I
remember it was like I was so happy like
yeah like I I have that win trophy it's
not even here so I can't show you but
it's like the basically the winner Hotel

[2:18:15]
it's like the basically the winner Hotel
it's really nice Trophy and
yeah it was I I literally can't remember
many moments in my life where I was I
was happier than that
um it was a big it was a big moment
um and then there would be uh WSOP

[2:18:30]
um and then there would be uh WSOP
bracelet which was
basically the same I was
very very happy and it was it was great
because it was like free bracelets it
was like the tag team event with two of
my best friends and it was an amazing
experience

[2:18:46]
experience
and like it was my first Vegas and like
I I wasn't even sure I can make it
through uh the trip without uh I don't
know without uh having to to go back at
some point or having to start selling

[2:19:00]
some point or having to start selling
action or whatever because it could have
been uh very expensive and then I was
sitting there just winning a bunch of
tournaments winning a WSOP bracelet it
was kind of sick
um then I've had the

[2:19:15]
um then I've had the
I guess last year I had a
so so in cash games I've had the Imagine
King uh era like the I would call it
error like two months or something where
I was basically playing the highest
games every day

[2:19:30]
games every day
sometimes two free sessions a day uh it
was very intense very good I had a
really good routine
um and I was really feeling good like I
was really feeling like I was the top of
my game uh feeling good about life about

[2:19:45]
my game uh feeling good about life about
everything
um yeah it was I was very happy for me
um and yeah I guess I had a pretty big
downswing uh like I said and a lot of it
came from entities as well and then I've

[2:20:00]
came from entities as well and then I've
done a lot of work uh about entities and
I've improved a lot
and then last year I've started having a
lot of success
uh basically had a bunch of final tables
in the 10K Sunday on GG and a bunch of

[2:20:16]
in the 10K Sunday on GG and a bunch of
deep France and good results and I guess
that was also pretty fun like having a
every Tuesday there would be the the
Stream
I think I've been to the final table
like five to ten times
um and I would share the link with like

[2:20:31]
um and I would share the link with like
friends from home like my parents uh
yeah I even remember there was the one
final table where there was like this
big uh Israeli holiday basically
Independence Day and the final table was
that day and I went to my parents house

[2:20:47]
that day and I went to my parents house
I was with family there were like 20
people or something and then at some
point I had to go to my room to play on
my laptop so and I'm playing on my room
and they are watching it downstairs with
the delay so it was pretty sick

[2:21:02]
the delay so it was pretty sick
um so yeah just uh just that and I guess
if I have to talk about uh
dust out of Poker I guess uh it relates
to poker but there was this I had a lot
of trouble with my parents uh even when

[2:21:17]
of trouble with my parents uh even when
I was making money already and being a
professional but at some point after
that Vegas I got acknowledgment from my
parents that like it was obviously a
process it was not a one-day thing ah
like you won a lot of money you're good

[2:21:31]
like you won a lot of money you're good
but at some point I realized that like
my father became from my biggest uh uh I
would say the Opposites of supporter to
like my biggest fan is like every day
every fashion like how how is it going

[2:21:45]
every fashion like how how is it going
how is it going for you when am I gonna
get another link to a final table blah
blah all these things and my mom is like
very supportive as well she's like you
just do your thing I'm happy for you as
long as you're happy and I trust you and

[2:22:00]
long as you're happy and I trust you and
basically my entire family is like that
nowadays and it's it it means a lot
because I wasn't the exact other side of
it and the feeling was really bad
because growing up like
uh maybe my my dad was a bit uh tough as

[2:22:19]
uh maybe my my dad was a bit uh tough as
a parent or anything or something like
that but it's not like I have bad
parents or anything like that it's it's
the complete opposite like I've always
had really good relationship with my
parents and then this happens and I I

[2:22:30]
parents and then this happens and I I
really feels like it feels like
something is really missing uh something
is really painful about it and then now
I it makes me really happy it makes me
really uh satisfied so I'm definitely
very happy about that that's amazing

[2:22:46]
very happy about that that's amazing
yeah I think it's one of those
feelings that most of us have to get
some sort of validation especially from
either peer groups or a family or
parents and often when we go down the
poker path we get anything but
validation we get generally told to get

[2:23:01]
validation we get generally told to get
back onto the normal job path of life
and very often this creates a bit of
kind of distance between
um our parents what our parents want
from us and what we're doing with our
lives and there's a kind of going on
different Paths of what we see for
ourselves when you have enough success
that you have and I hope the players

[2:23:15]
that you have and I hope the players
just listen to this as well can relate
to this when you have enough success it
almost like emerges back and there's a
level of acceptance where they stop
trying to mold you into what they want
you to be and they start to accept you
for who you are and they start to uh let
you make your own mistakes but also they
started more trust in you and I think

[2:23:30]
started more trust in you and I think
this definitely takes time no one gets
this like is a free pass unless you've
got very understanding parents but it
sounds like yourself like just constant
success over time an attitude of
professionalism towards what you're
doing your parents don't have more and
more trust in you and seeing what you're
doing and it comes to the point where
they're like all right you're on the

[2:23:45]
they're like all right you're on the
right path so yeah I must have been a
amazing moment to get that so um did
anything change for you in terms of like
you're approaching things I know
sometimes we can go through life with a
little bit of a point to proof bit of a
chip on our shoulder did anything kind
of change for you or did you feel
different about yourself when your
parents in particular started to accept

[2:24:01]
parents in particular started to accept
your patterns give you a bit more
validation for for the book of pursuit
I think in general uh things changed a
lot over the last few years just
um
not I wouldn't even say

[2:24:15]
not I wouldn't even say
um because of my results or anything
like that of or what I've I've or what
I've achieved in poker because if you
asked me I I think I'm I'm far from
digesting all the stuff like I'm I'm not

[2:24:30]
digesting all the stuff like I'm I'm not
really uh realizing where I am and what
I've done
um and I think that's okay that's the
way I I take these things
um and like yeah like I told Renee like
one of the reasons I I agreed to come

[2:24:46]
one of the reasons I I agreed to come
here like Rene approached me a couple
times before I said yes and
I went to Vegas this year and I like
every table I was sitting in it it seems
like everybody knows me

[2:25:00]
like everybody knows me
um I guess it had a lot to do with like
some ice takes tournaments and online
games that I played over the last years
and and it just happened and I kind of
liked just being under the radar I never
wanted to be famous or anything like

[2:25:15]
wanted to be famous or anything like
that yes I I do want to wanna play poker
and be very good at it but my goal was
never like to be the best player in the
world or like to be the most famous one
or anything like that
um but it just happened that I'm well

[2:25:30]
um but it just happened that I'm well
known
so might as well do the podcast and
I forgot that I forgot the main question
what it was
uh we're grateful that you have to
joined the podcast and I want to share
so what do you think's changed for you

[2:25:46]
so what do you think's changed for you
since you had become a bit more
well-known any sort of things you had to
adapt to uh because like you said you
wanted to go on the Limelight in general
anything you have to adapt to to getting
more attention on yourself
so yeah I was saying uh I've just done a

[2:26:00]
so yeah I was saying uh I've just done a
lot of work on myself as a person and
just became much
like my therapist like to say I'm much
I'm a much better friend of Barack than
I used to be
um which for me is is huge because I've
struggled with a lot of things uh

[2:26:16]
struggled with a lot of things uh
mentally and yeah of course it's still a
work in progress but uh yeah I think
I've just grown a lot of the person and
that's
probably uh

[2:26:31]
probably uh
uh a big part of why I made uh of why
I've had the the big success that I've
had as well in poker so yeah
yeah I think for you as well it's been
very clear how much you've grown both on

[2:26:46]
very clear how much you've grown both on
and off the tables and how they're kind
of intertwined along the way in terms of
understanding yourself better the
self-awareness dealing with your
emotions all of these are like things
you're dealing with both at the pocket
tables and away and yeah I think for you
it's been you've been a really great
example for our audience of what can

[2:27:01]
example for our audience of what can
happen when you really put the work in
on yourself because this stuff's not
easy it's very easy to turn away from
the kind of insecurities the emotions
that come up the pain that you
experience as we've talked about and not
go into it not really explore and go
where's this coming from how do I solve

[2:27:15]
where's this coming from how do I solve
this how do I get to uh to know myself
better how do I become a better friend
at Barack as your your therapist said so
I think those are the journey that
players need to go on to grow hopefully
people are inspired to go down their own
Journey if they haven't started already
so yeah I thank you for being so
vulnerable and sharing your journey I
want to ask you about skipping levels

[2:27:32]
want to ask you about skipping levels
you mentioned like you've basically
jumped in at higher levels especially
when you went from entities to cash
games what do things allowed you to
potentially uh take a few shortcuts and
jump into levels because I think for
some players who may try to replicate
what you do or they would maybe fail at

[2:27:47]
what you do or they would maybe fail at
the first handle so to speak but it's
quite challenging to miss levels often
when players go to new formats they'll
start at like lower stakes in the grind
the way the Midstates and all the work
that way up you can is when I kind of
straight into um uh I think it's 5 10 or
10 20 straight away so you you almost

[2:28:01]
10 20 straight away so you you almost
skipped level so what allowed you to
jump in at higher levels and what are
some of the skills that you need to
learn for that okay so so I was just
clarify that um it's not like uh one day
I decided that okay I'm good enough to
play five then I will do it or like I'm

[2:28:15]
play five then I will do it or like I'm
good enough to play uh a 500 rmtt so I
can play it and and then it just worked
out I obviously started from scratch
um I I think I was playing like
not very high online entities and

[2:28:31]
not very high online entities and
basically run it up
um and then
I don't know like playing 50 ABI 70 ABI
100 API tournaments and then I don't
know I'd be higher than that and then

[2:28:45]
know I'd be higher than that and then
started mixing in live and then
obviously like playing
I don't know maybe 1K API live with
selling action and then having success
just
basically what I'm talking about is
skipping a bunch of uh

[2:29:02]
things along I mean about the road is
that I just had a lot of success kind of
instantly not really instantly but uh
relatively fast much faster I guess than

[2:29:16]
relatively fast much faster I guess than
the average guy in every format and
every bind that I was playing so let's
say for example in Israel there is a
basically I I would say almost no
Israeli Pro that have never been to

[2:29:31]
Israeli Pro that have never been to
Bulgaria because Bulgaria is like uh
there are many live tournaments there
there is I think the Israeli Poker
series goes there for like twice a year
or something and or even more impressed
and basically any Israeli player you ask

[2:29:47]
and basically any Israeli player you ask
has been I've been there between one to
I don't know 30 times and then for me
I've never been there why because I
don't know I just skipped this I I
instantly uh played higher than that I

[2:30:00]
instantly uh played higher than that I
instantly wanted to play a hiring on
that
um but it's not because I just decided
that I can do it it's just because I had
like the the background to to get me
there
um from online and and just uh yeah I I
made some money and was able to do it

[2:30:16]
made some money and was able to do it
um and then when I was when I was
playing higher live it all it also
worked out so basically
if you if you think about it it's kind
of like six years almost of the sun
running but uh yeah if uh if it's

[2:30:32]
running but uh yeah if uh if it's
something like that it's it's something
like that at least when moving up
because
uh the beginning was very good for me I
guess the first two years a lot of
things worked out really well and then

[2:30:45]
things worked out really well and then
I've had a lot of money and I was
already
uh very good about
a lot of the other stuff about
management so then I was able with my uh
good amount of money not to punt it away
and make smart decisions

[2:31:02]
and make smart decisions
so yeah basically
that's that's about how it happens it's
just like
yeah I don't know
having the the talent and the skill set

[2:31:15]
having the the talent and the skill set
to just uh adjust to any format any
buying along the way uh whether it's
from
strategy uh
kind of a point of view or like uh
management point of view or anything

[2:31:31]
management point of view or anything
like that
um yeah also your tolerance for risk is
fairly high so you're able to uh almost
like roll with these good patches and
put yourself in higher games as it kind
of bipark to that and also I think
you've got a very good balance where
you're able to deal with anything that

[2:31:45]
you're able to deal with anything that
happens anyway so it's not like you're
going in these games hoping that it runs
it goes well obviously a lot of your
shot ticks have went well early on uh
but I mean if you get lucky long enough
it's no longer look it's one of those
things where you've got certain factors
that are going your way but also you
were able to handle any risk that you

[2:32:01]
were able to handle any risk that you
took on obviously there would have been
challenges if things didn't go your way
but able to recalibrate so yeah I think
for you it's even though we talk about
being quick it's relatively quick we're
talking about it's still been many years
of progression many years of leveling up
and yeah for you you've just been able
to uh move faster than most people due

[2:32:17]
to uh move faster than most people due
to yeah a lot of things we discussed
today
how about yourself running in how do you
feel like your journey was relatively in
terms of you know take risks were you
able to skip any levels or did you do a
linear buying by buy-in air Pursuit very

[2:32:31]
linear buying by buy-in air Pursuit very
linear starting at the free rules 10 NL
25 an hour 15 now on the now 200 denial
you name it just slowly slowly upstairs
definitely way less uh risk taking way
more risk-averse always playing it safe

[2:32:47]
more risk-averse always playing it safe
so to speak uh so yeah definitely not
like Barrack but I definitely feel like
it's something that enhances looking
back I I should have probably worked on
because I definitely feel like I left

[2:33:01]
because I definitely feel like I left
out
uh yeah a lot of a lot of EV by not
being more aggressive but to be fair
also very early in my career going pro
basically after I decided to sort of Go
Pro stop study I think it took me four
months to go broke

[2:33:16]
months to go broke
so that definitely I think also quite a
big dent like I was I was definitely a
bit more risk-averse after that uh
actually I think it happened twice even
so then at some point I was like okay
I'm not gonna play high sex anymore
because or at least that back then was I

[2:33:31]
because or at least that back then was I
think maybe 10 20 where I think I lost a
lot 5 10 10 20 years ago I'll just uh
I'll just grind to four you know and
then and that's it I I remember I also
looking looking back that has such a
huge Compound Effect because basically I

[2:33:45]
huge Compound Effect because basically I
got broke then I had to get a steak I
have to give away uh you know a big part
of your profit and then if you look at
the compound of that then I didn't I was
risk-averse so I didn't want to play 5
10 or 10 20 so I was just grinding it
back on 2-4 grinding everything back but
also I have to give uh a part of your

[2:34:02]
also I have to give uh a part of your
winnings away so if I look at it the
amount of money that going broke early
cost me it's uh I'm being risk averse so
that experience cost me a lot of money I
I don't want to calculate exactly how
much but if you compound it was quite a

[2:34:16]
much but if you compound it was quite a
lot uh I was I was curious Barrick what
do you think is the most important
lesson that poker has taught you
um

[2:34:30]
I don't know about a
building lesson rather than just
experiences
um yeah I think I've talked about it
a few times by now but it's just
yeah it's just like poker is like life

[2:34:47]
yeah it's just like poker is like life
there is many many many similarities you
just have to pay attention and
yeah it just gives you like uh I just
told my friend the other day where like

[2:35:00]
told my friend the other day where like
um
I was offered some kind of deal and and
eventually I didn't want to go through
with it because I felt like something
was a beach Shady or something about it
and then I told him like I have a

[2:35:15]
and then I told him like I have a
feeling that
for 27 year old guy that you know my my
job is not to socialize with people and
and yeah I'm not like a detective at the
police or anything like that I have a
pretty good sense of

[2:35:30]
pretty good sense of
like understanding how people operate
and and what motivates them and things
like that which is pretty cool
um so yeah maybe it's not like a lesson
that I've learned but just a lot of
experience

[2:35:45]
experience
um a lot of like unexpected experience
that I wouldn't say appears but it's
just it's it's out there
um yeah you would say you just you
developed this skill through your
experience dealing with poker especially
live

[2:36:00]
live
yep yep
you I would say to most people's
definition of success are a very
successful poker player what is your
definition of success
that's uh that's a very good question

[2:36:16]
that's uh that's a very good question
you just brought a smile to my face
because there is uh my favorite rapper
nowadays his name is NF
and he has two songs where he's uh where
he starts with what's what's your
definition of success so it's uh oh

[2:36:31]
definition of success so it's uh oh
really yeah it's a really good one
um I think my definition of success is
so you you guys should look him up it's
it's pretty good yeah so it's uh
I think it's first of all doing what you

[2:36:45]
I think it's first of all doing what you
like I can't imagine what I would be
doing if I wasn't playing poker like
there is literally
I got a really really tempting job offer
last year doing something completely
different getting paid

[2:37:00]
different getting paid
a lot of money I'm not sure if it would
have been more money that I'm making but
it would have been
with no risk so and it could be much
higher at some point
um but I said no and it was a pretty
easy decision

[2:37:15]
easy decision
just because like
I don't know
I I think I had to commit for like one
year or something and I said like there
is no way like I'm not gonna stop
playing playing poker right now there's
just this is what I love to do it

[2:37:30]
just this is what I love to do it
doesn't have to do with money it doesn't
have to do with the risks
this is just who I am
um at least for for a while now maybe at
one point I will want to stop but
right now I don't see myself ever doing
anything different and this is the first
thing and the second thing is just like

[2:37:47]
thing and the second thing is just like
being happy just like being making sure
like okay this is who I am and this is
what I want to do but am I happy
and of course like we all have uh bad

[2:38:01]
and of course like we all have uh bad
faces we all have like ups and downs but
always trying to uh to reach that
happiness like trying to do more and
more things
wherever they are related to Poker or
not and most of them are not related to

[2:38:16]
not and most of them are not related to
poker at all
um yeah just try and doing more of that
and and being happy so yeah just doing
what you like as long as you can afford
to do it and
yes trying to be happy trying to be a

[2:38:30]
yes trying to be happy trying to be a
good person
trying to have like I can definitely say
I I've met a lot of good people along
the way I have a great family I have
great friends from all over the world
um which I am I feel really blessed for

[2:38:45]
um which I am I feel really blessed for
um and yeah definitely uh have uh some
steps uh to climb in order to get that
happiness but I'm definitely uh on the
way there and I'm and I'm happy for it
Adam you have any final questions you

[2:39:01]
Adam you have any final questions you
would like to ask Barrack before let him
go
no I'd like to thank park by his time I
know you were in two minds whether to
joined us on the podcast and run ahead
of twist your arm a few times so we
appreciate you for joining us and our
audience is gonna really take a lot of
wisdom from this conversation so thanks

[2:39:16]
wisdom from this conversation so thanks
a lot for your time
thank you guys that was it was very nice
thank you a lot Barrack for coming on
and sharing all your wisdom that you
acquired through this journey Adam

[2:39:30]
acquired through this journey Adam
what were your main takeaways from
Barrack's story
yeah very inspired by Brett's story and
his journey from the d-gen which we
started the conversation with to the
high stakes player that is today and all
the lessons you learn along the way and
I really liked how we went back and

[2:39:46]
I really liked how we went back and
forth Lincoln lessons he was learning in
poker to how it was impact in his life
and one of the big takeaways for me was
the skill of self-awareness and realized
in wait a second I've got loads of
traits and triggers and things that are
happening at the pocket tables I need to

[2:40:00]
happening at the pocket tables I need to
do some work to address those so you
work with a therapist he did a lot of
self-reflecting and he started to
realize that emotions were coming up
over and over as he's playing and things
were triggering him and he did a lot of
work to understand where they're coming
from and I really liked to like the
place he ended up at the end where he

[2:40:15]
place he ended up at the end where he
talked about experience and emotions
feeling emotions and being with them and
also like being with the pain I try to
really go deep into a few topics for him
and go how do you how do you experience
pain how do you process it and it's
really interesting how we he first of
all acknowledged that I'm just with it I
experienced pain I experienced the

[2:40:31]
experienced pain I experienced the
emotion as it's there and then he talked
about how he uses the mind they can
reframe stuff and come up with kind of
corporate strategies how we talk to
friends they're really information to
them and then how he reminds himself
where he's at so all these kind of
skills he's learning to uh to deal with
the adversity of being a poker player

[2:40:45]
the adversity of being a poker player
and I think it was a really good
conversation about both the good side of
Poker and the challenging parts of it
where things get tough and you do
experience a lot of negative emotions He
also mentioned forgiving himself and
that his therapist said he's a better
better friend to Barrack which I thought

[2:41:00]
better friend to Barrack which I thought
was really nice because I think a lot of
players I speak with have perfectionist
traits they won't do everything right
they want to make sure they don't make
mistakes and they fight against this
urge to want to be perfect and very
often that drive to want to be perfect
creates a lot of emotions creates a lot
of tension Crystal frustration and the

[2:41:16]
of tension Crystal frustration and the
only solution is to give yourself
permission to make mistakes forgive
yourself be kind of yourself I think you
mentioned run it have more empathy
towards yourself these are the only kind
of solutions to that problem not to not
make mistakes because that's like uh
never gonna happen another thing I
related about the conversation is it

[2:41:30]
related about the conversation is it
approached a risk very uh it's not
unique but a very kind of high tolerance
to risk we could call it where he
definitely goes for a more that's taking
a lot of risk and he mentioned the
factors that led to that in terms of his
life circumstances his bankroll his
commitments in life overall and then

[2:41:47]
commitments in life overall and then
also which I thought was really
important how he can handle uh risk he
can handle when things go badly because
that's the kind of double-edged Sword if
you want to go high risk High rewards
you're also going for the high bad side
High downsides when things don't go your

[2:42:00]
High downsides when things don't go your
way and you've got to be able to deal
with that from a mindset perspective
from a almost like a self-doubt
perspective and build a hand of that and
he is definitely perfected that skill
set I worked in those tools that when
things go really badly he can work
himself through that he can get back out
of it so he's able to put himself in

[2:42:15]
of it so he's able to put himself in
these high-risk High reward scenarios
without breaking down now the takeaway
that came across for many topics was
Finding what works for you but it works
for yourself within those Frameworks if
you guys try to repeat everything
characters I'm sure you'll find some
obstacles it's finding your own kind of
path with the kind of

[2:42:31]
path with the kind of
um guidelines that were mapped up today
a lot of really good topics and yeah
looking forward to watching this back
myself how about yourself or anybody
what was in the main takeaways for you
the main things that uh stood out to me
from a technical perspective or

[2:42:46]
from a technical perspective or
definitely dances that he gave around
what do you think common leaks are
another thing that he talked a lot about
was life pay attention Okay it's live
especially if you're an online player
it's a very different game and he
mentioned let's say for example online

[2:43:00]
mentioned let's say for example online
players is way more common that they
will randomize so your decision within a
range might be plus 3bb plus minus 3bb
for example whereas in life where things
are way less randomized people either
always have it or never have it making a

[2:43:16]
always have it or never have it making a
decision or making good decisions or
negative decisions usually costs you
away more money and again that comes
down to
um life
because people don't randomize you have
a way accurate you can get a way more
accurate view of what villain's range

[2:43:32]
accurate view of what villain's range
actually is so it kind of ties hand in
hand with the first part and just the
fact that your decision making process
playing at that level it will be way
different than the decision making
process that Barrack probably has when
he plays three four-handed against some

[2:43:46]
he plays three four-handed against some
of the best in the world okay there's
also definitely something they mentioned
while when I go play a live poker I have
to kind of switch my brain it's a
completely different environment the way
or the things that are taking
consideration when making decisions is
completely different my decision making
process is not the same and if you keep

[2:44:01]
process is not the same and if you keep
your this is making process the same
life you will not get the desired
results as I think I'll something that
he pointed out
and uh alas I wrote down how much
mistakes are technical mistakes because
he observed that
a lot of the problems that players
usually have is not their off-gain

[2:44:15]
usually have is not their off-gain
knowledge but it's their in-game
performance so if you want to know if
this is the case reflect on the amount
of mistakes that you make and see if in
hindsight you immediately know what the
correct play actually is uh because
that's usually indicates more of a

[2:44:30]
that's usually indicates more of a
performance mistake now it could be that
you just over complicated your strategy
or you don't know your strategy good
enough and therefore you make mistakes
when playing but then look for what kind
of triggers that happen or what kind of
emotional state was I in when making
this mistake and what triggered that

[2:44:46]
this mistake and what triggered that
emotional stake because then you can
work on the trigger this is something
for example that Adam puts a lot of work
in in his coaching as well which I think
is very beneficial now if you want to
work with me and Adam and make more

[2:45:00]
work with me and Adam and make more
progress in your career and basically
