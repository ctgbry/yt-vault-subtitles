[00:00]
in the end you have to become good at
poker
okay
and then translate that poker knowledge
technically that you have by playing in
poker games we're actually playing the
volume right preferably for as much
money as possible versus

[00:15]
money as possible versus
as weakest opponents as possible that's
basically how you make money in poker in
a nutshell
[Music]
hi there boys and girls and welcome back

[00:30]
hi there boys and girls and welcome back
to another video here at the poker
ambition channel in which today i am
going to be explaining you guys how to
become a more successful poker player
over the years i've gained a lot of
experience in understanding how this
actually works by rising through the

[00:46]
actually works by rising through the
poker ranks myself by seeing people
around me by afterwards coaching other
students it's gotten clearer and clearer
to me how success in poker really works
and today in this video i want to share
that with you guys now we are going to
be measuring success on a skill from

[01:03]
be measuring success on a skill from
zero to a hundred okay i'll get clearer
in a second but let's say on a score
from zero to twenty if you're a poker
player you're considered a recreational
player you score very low right if 100

[01:15]
player you score very low right if 100
is the highest there's the elites then
zero is the lowest between 20 and 40 you
could call yourself like a little a
hobbyist poker player or a striving
professional and when you reach the 40
to 60 mark i would say the 60 mark
you can be considered a professional

[01:31]
you can be considered a professional
poker player now the higher you go there
because you have successful poker
players very successful poker players
medium successful poker players so
they're from there on the you score the
more success in poker you basically have
so
how do we actually score these points

[01:48]
i'm gonna give
an example how pro evolution soccer and
fifa do it we got the ballon d'or winner
messi
arguably one of the best football
players in the world

[02:00]
players in the world
or soccer for
the americans
uh here we can see
how
high the score messi is 94 at fifa 93
pass
apparently evaluates this player a
little bit higher
and 100 is again the highest so he would

[02:16]
and 100 is again the highest so he would
be considered
an elite right he's definitely within
the 80 to 100 skill
how did he get to 94
we can see that here provolution soccer
does it with a diagram like this and

[02:30]
does it with a diagram like this and
fifa just sums it up he's very good at
passing shooting he has very high pace
so he's very fast he's excellent in
dribbling which is obviously his
strongest skill
bass and fifa both agree
defensively speaking though pass

[02:45]
defensively speaking though pass
basically says it's non-existent
while fifa is a little bit more gentle
and gives the guy a 38 and physically
speaking you know he's not the tallest
he's not you know the the the bulkiest
of players you know he's not a adama
trade from wolverhampton shout out to

[03:01]
trade from wolverhampton shout out to
that guy
no so mainly
he got 294 because of these attributes
right and in poker it kind of works the
same
here they had six criteria where they
evaluated this player on in poker

[03:17]
evaluated this player on in poker
there is four or at least in my opinion
the poker success pie we will call it
four areas we have the engine which up
makes up for 25
of becoming a good poker player if the

[03:30]
of becoming a good poker player if the
technical side obvious we have mental
gamer performance and i think these two
sections are
often worked on
and often discussed the engine i will
explain that in a second has more
something to do with your belief systems
your conditionings this kind of stuff

[03:46]
your conditionings this kind of stuff
and then last but not least we have the
soft skills and management side okay so
get very good at all these areas score
and become a very successful poker
player that's kind of how it works
we should start seeing it as a game the

[04:03]
we should start seeing it as a game the
player with the highest score will make
the most money
okay and therefore will be the most
successful poker player that we can have
make a whole nother video about what
success really is okay because the

[04:17]
success really is okay because the
definition of success
might vary but i think for the sake of
this video let's keep it at who made the
most money right in the end
you have to understand what your
definition of success is and trying to
create your life around achieving that

[04:31]
create your life around achieving that
definition of success okay
you need a little bit of all
the points that i just addressed but can
specialize in different areas to gain an
edge i will give you guys a couple of

[04:45]
edge i will give you guys a couple of
examples
how a certain player specialized in one
area and therefore became a successful
poker player
so we have the dedicated grinder first
and as you can see here he scores 70
which as we remember between 1680 you

[05:01]
which as we remember between 1680 you
were a professional poker player so this
guy is a professional poker player he
scores 70 he has reached a high enough
score by developing in certain areas we
see that this guy
his engine
is very high within the engine there's
motivation discipline

[05:15]
motivation discipline
conditionings belief systems mindset
this kind of stuff
he is an expert
he scores 25 points in this area in
other areas you know he's still well
balanced but
he is not
you know he's not the best technical

[05:31]
you know he's not the best technical
player if he would go up against
the the elite of the elite he will
probably fall short technically speaking
however
he does put in a lot of volume he's very
consistent and therefore in the end of
the year he has still made enough money

[05:45]
the year he has still made enough money
to consider him a successful poker
player okay
another example lioness love as i
already talked about
excels in the technical area obviously
you know we are talking about one of the
best poker players and obviously you

[06:00]
best poker players and obviously you
know engine meant the game is obviously
all on point right because we're talking
about the elite but i'm trying to make a
point here line is very good technical
soft skills and management so in these
for example we could include things like
game selection he doesn't really score

[06:16]
game selection he doesn't really score
that high and i remember when i
uh was playing i think it was 5 10 with
lioness love
we would play three four-handed and then
when the table would fill up with a
recreational player linus actually
always left the game and started a new

[06:31]
always left the game and started a new
three or four-handed game okay he
clearly didn't give a [ __ ] about game
selection
because
he considered himself way better than
the rest so if you are let's say number
one in the world
any table that you're gonna play in

[06:45]
any table that you're gonna play in
you're gonna be a profitable player
whereas let's say you're number 500 in
the world in order to become profitable
at the table you should not play against
numbers 499 and lower right you should
look for games where you play against a
number of thousands in the world the
number 2 000 in the world but given the

[07:01]
number 2 000 in the world but given the
fact that you're very good technically
you can kind of neglect the game
selection because any game that you will
play in you would have a big edge okay
then we can also look at actually at the
score within the score which

[07:16]
score within the score which
i'm going to be talking way more in
depth about later on
but basically if this is technical then
within technical we can see okay what's
your theoretical knowledge what is your
gto knowledge we can see okay how good
are you at exploitation how good are you

[07:31]
are you at exploitation how good are you
playing versus other ranks how good are
you playing against the recreationals i
remember there was a podcast once i
think it was with jeans if i'm not
mistaking it was on the joe ingram
podcast
shout out to joe ingram go check out the
podcast and jeans talked about how

[07:46]
podcast and jeans talked about how
there were definitely tables if he was
up against i think it was ben 86 and
sauce he said yeah there are definitely
way better players than me however if
the fish joins the table and it's
six-handed i make the most money
now what he tried to say with that is

[08:00]
now what he tried to say with that is
that he's not technically or at least a
gto versus rex a better player than
sauce or ben however he thought that
versus the fish
and a six-handed table with the fish he
would extract more money out of the fish
than

[08:15]
than
ben or sauce did so in the end he would
be the most profitable player and if we
call that the definition of success and
he's actually the best player
and now some people would be like yeah
but ben is better and salsa better
and this again is your definition of
success it's your definition of who is a

[08:30]
success it's your definition of who is a
good poker player and when are you a
good poker player okay there's no
universal answer here
another example is the butt the bot is
uh
not a great technical player i mean he
scores half there is a lot of room for
improvement here so if the bot would

[08:46]
improvement here so if the bot would
want to improve
uh his success in poker you should
probably work on his technical game soft
skills management also not that great
but he is a mental game and performance
beast he shows up grinds eight hours a
day has a very decent mindset you know

[09:00]
day has a very decent mindset you know
here in the engine side
but he's just a performance beast what
he knows technically the 12 and a half
that this course here comes out every
day okay we can have someone who's very
good technically let's say you score 25
but your mental game and performance
sucks

[09:15]
sucks
one
what actually will come out of that
technical knowledge in game will be
maybe only even half okay due to maybe
like some mental game issues or
performance issues
or as well let's say for example your
engine isn't on point you're very good
technically but you're very unmotivated

[09:32]
technically but you're very unmotivated
uh or you have a lot of tilt issues
then also you cannot put in the volume
in the end you have to become good at
poker
okay
and then translate that poker knowledge
technically that you have by playing in

[09:46]
technically that you have by playing in
poker games we're actually playing the
volume right preferably for as much
money as possible versus
as weak as opponents as possible that's
basically how you make money in poker in
a nutshell okay but again this player
layer also scores 70. he might grind

[10:00]
layer also scores 70. he might grind
half the win rate
compared to the the technical specialist
for example however if he plays three
times more volume and can
do that more consistently he in the end
will actually make more money than the
guy who's actually better technical okay
and there's many examples of players who

[10:17]
and there's many examples of players who
maybe other players would not view as
great players but they would always be
there every day and in the end if you
look at who made more money it was the
bot
alright another example the fishermen
who specialize in soft skills management

[10:31]
who specialize in soft skills management
he's very good at
playing in very soft games as you can
see here his technical skills aren't
that great let's say technically
speaking his number thousand in the
world however
he has good networking skills he's maybe
a social guy plays a lot of life for

[10:46]
a social guy plays a lot of life for
example gets invited in private games
and therefore he doesn't have to be that
great technically he can be a thousand
in the world because in the games that
he gets himself in he's playing against
the number 10 000 in the world for a lot
of money okay so in the end this guy
could make way more money

[11:00]
could make way more money
than
the lioness love okay who was an
excellent technical player now you know
he still has some room for improvement
because again he scores 70 right as you
can see everyone scores 70 and that's
kind of the point that i wanted to make
he there's definitely room for
improvement right he could definitely

[11:15]
improvement right he could definitely
improve in these two areas however you
know it's a very good uh
very good mindset and always gets
himself in good games knows when to play
knows when not to play etc etc so again
he also scores 70. so there's multiple
ways

[11:30]
ways
you can become a successful poker player
there's various areas in which you can
specialize in
to become a successful poker player
at different points in your career you
will be forced or voluntarily work more
or less on these areas for example if

[11:46]
or less on these areas for example if
you just started out playing poker
obviously you're gonna spend a lot of
time on your technical gaming right it's
kind of the first thing that you do you
might neglect the other factors a little
bit because that's the area that's
especially in the beginning i would say
most important to excel at then at some

[12:01]
most important to excel at then at some
point let's say
you find yourself a bit stuck and you
get frustrated and you're trying to
become better technically you're only
putting in all the time technically for
example you might create a big gap
between your
in-game knowledge and your off-game
knowledge you think you're very good but

[12:15]
knowledge you think you're very good but
in-game it doesn't come out due to other
factors okay maybe you have some
unresolved issues maybe you have
you know a fixed mindset maybe you tilt
easily maybe you have wrong expectations
etc etc all
things that will cost you

[12:30]
things that will cost you
okay
do not become a successful poker player
because if you're only scoring technical
as we saw
let's say you scored 25 a technical one
only five in the rest you didn't make it
you didn't reach 60 80 the score minimum
that you need
in order to become a successful poker

[12:46]
in order to become a successful poker
player or a professional poker player in
general right and obviously i think no
one has zero zero zero
you always have at least one or two or
three or four or five but what do you
specialize in and what can you improve
it

[13:01]
it
there are always some extreme cases
outliers don't look at them as an excuse
he doesn't do x y so i don't have to
either okay this is very common that you
look for the outliers yeah but you know
this guy does nothing on mental game

[13:16]
this guy does nothing on mental game
there's nothing on the engine does
nothing on management he only looks at
the solver and executes well maybe he
naturally doesn't have any mental game
issues okay he doesn't have any
performance issues
all right
same with like if i'm gonna give you

[13:32]
same with like if i'm gonna give you
here a lecture about how important it is
to live a healthy lifestyle then you
look at the guy who just being the
tournament say look at the guy man he
weighs 100 kilos he won't raise 150
kilos he's completely obese yeah it
happens but it's not the majority okay

[13:45]
happens but it's not the majority okay
this is again this is a mindset that uh
i also talk about
so if we go back to messi and messi
would come to me say hey mr wacko
i've seen you on the football pitch you
make some moves here and there how can i
improve you know how can i improve then

[14:00]
improve you know how can i improve then
i would not say to messi to work on his
dribbling skills right he can maybe
score half a point if he would work on
that for a year however if he will put
you know a couple of afternoons a month
into defensive game we can definitely
you know
get him up 10 points right so if messi

[14:17]
get him up 10 points right so if messi
would want to improve
and read and up this 39 uh this 93 and
his 94
he would probably bulk up a little bit
physically
and
improve his defensive capabilities okay

[14:30]
improve his defensive capabilities okay
there's no point for him to work more on
dribbling however naturally speaking we
like to work on the things that we're
already good at so in which area should
you improve to become a more successful
poker player
all right maybe
i hope that the way i just explained it

[14:46]
i hope that the way i just explained it
already gave you gain some clarity into
oh wow so this is actually how success
in poker works and you can now probably
think of some examples or like oh yeah
actually that's true all right
well
becoming a more successful poker player

[15:00]
becoming a more successful poker player
i made a four-part video series
available in academy at
pokerambition.com
where i go very deep into these topics
okay this is just an introduction of how
success and poker works and obviously
now we can go very deep into the four

[15:16]
now we can go very deep into the four
specific topics and start to
give you more information so you can
evaluate hey do i notice hey do i do
this and in the end you would have
very good clarity where you would put
your motivation in in terms of time okay

[15:30]
your motivation in in terms of time okay
i'll quickly give an overview of what i
will be discussing in this video series
in the first part the engine we will
talk about belief systems conditionings
and your environment
and this is basically where the engine
is built okay
often

[15:45]
often
people in the poker at some points if
something is wrong in their mindset in
their mentality and their belief systems
their conditionings
it will come out in your journey to
become a very good poker player
afterwards we talk about mentality and
perception

[16:00]
perception
mainly
about how you perceive certain events
that all events like
bad beats like down swings like other
obstacles in array they're neutral
because everyone will face them and it's
how you face them how you perceive them

[16:15]
how you face them how you perceive them
that will determine if you're gonna make
it yes or no okay we'll talk about
self-awareness as i say here in the in
the engine the warning lights in your
desk informing you about male
functioning in the engine you need
self-awareness because
if this is where you are now and this is

[16:30]
if this is where you are now and this is
where you want to go add some you will
start here and at some point you would
drill off-road right and self-awareness
because this is going to happen only
with self-awareness we can course
correct faster okay
confidence motivation and discipline the

[16:46]
confidence motivation and discipline the
view and loss to your engine obviously
it's also a performance thing we need
confidence we need motivation and we
need to be disciplined in order to
execute consistently after every section
i will give a little evaluation sheet an

[17:02]
i will give a little evaluation sheet an
evaluation sheet comes with the four
part series where you can keep track of
your score and after the four part
series you have perfect clarity
what you score well in what you're not
scoring so well in and where in which

[17:15]
scoring so well in and where in which
area you should put your motivation and
energy in order to become a more
successful poker player
then we talk about the technical we're
gonna talk about how poker really works
a basic understanding of the game then
we're gonna talk about some fundamental
theory and gto how we use it to become

[17:30]
theory and gto how we use it to become
better players we're going to talk about
making highest vacuum highest ev
decisions aka exploitation how does
exploitation work and in the end we're
going to put it all together and playing
your strategy like to sum up
um what is your baseline strategy and

[17:45]
um what is your baseline strategy and
we're going to talk a lot about your
decision-making process right how can we
turn the knowledge that we gained in the
other chapters into questions we can ask
ourselves while playing at the tables
what should we take in consideration to
make better decisions at the table
basically

[18:00]
basically
metagame performance the coach and the
player the analyst and the performer
we're gonna talk about your inner critic
again it's kind of the perception how do
you perceive and how do you react
towards making mistakes
expectation and reality management i'm

[18:15]
expectation and reality management i'm
gonna talk about the root cause to all
your frustrations and the source of
energy is expectation management we
could kind of call it also i think i've
seen this a lot with my students and you
see this in poker all the time people
kind of go off real right we either

[18:30]
kind of go off real right we either
think we're better than we are or we
think we're worse than we actually are
based on short-term results when we lose
a little bit we feel like the worst
player in the world when we play very
well we feel like okay this is new
reality we love this new reality our ego
likes it and

[18:45]
likes it and
basically you kind of get a bloated
image of how good you really are and
then usually at some point that comes
crashing down and then you're at the
other side again of feeding like the
worst player in the world and basically
this chapter will help you stay in line
we'll talk about mental game mistakes

[19:00]
we'll talk about mental game mistakes
how certain mistakes that we make are
not technical but actually mental and i
will show you
uh inspiration mental and history from
jared tender how to work through that
and how we can use this to fix
underlying flaws in our decision making
process and we're gonna talk about the

[19:16]
process and we're gonna talk about the
importance of recovery getting more
success by working less and less but in
these soft skills and management we're
gonna talk about the compound effect how
understanding this concept should affect
what where and how much you play and
spend kind of think rethink

[19:32]
spend kind of think rethink
why we play how much we play which games
we play which approach we take a lot of
things people just do because they copy
other people right they are conditioned
remember it was the first one in the end
and that's why i think it's very
important to start with the engine okay

[19:47]
important to start with the engine okay
and your conditioning
then the feedback loop it's the concept
of continuous improvement basically i
will show you how to get better in poker
which is a very valuable skill
three managing your own career finding

[20:00]
three managing your own career finding
out what works for you and when to make
a change and number four game selection
and grind optimization the way to get to
elite results money rise right and this
is everything to do with
you know
trying to get yourself in the best games
possible trying to play for as much

[20:15]
possible trying to play for as much
money as you can afford to lose because
in the end in a nutshell that is how you
make money in poker
