dear
888 poker

[00:17]
888 poker
i still remember the day that we met
money
flying over the tables
usually in my favor
my bankroll kept on growing
and growing

[00:31]
and growing
as u88 allowed me to move through the
stakes all the way up to 5100 push
forward where i was able to gamble it up
of all the sites that i played on 88

[00:45]
of all the sites that i played on 88
poker you
were always
my favorite
but lately
i've started to feel this mutual
love
fading
as you force me to deposit

[01:01]
as you force me to deposit
over and over again
and i'm starting to get the feeling
that i'm the only one putting an effort
into this relationship
i've responded to your messages

[01:17]
i've responded to your messages
insufficient funds please deposit
i have spoken your love languages by
raking my ass off and what do i get in
return
gold coins and a one dollar blast

[01:31]
gold coins and a one dollar blast
[Music]
i feel like the time has come for you to
speak my love language again
which is a more equal card distribution
among the players
and if you really

[01:45]
and if you really
still love me
even in my favor
[Music]
so it's up to you now
do you love me
for playing on your site
or is it only my credit card
that you're interested in

[02:04]
[Music]

[02:24]
hi there boys and girls and welcome back
to another video here at the poker
ambition channel it's time for monthly

[02:31]
ambition channel it's time for monthly
recap
given the many deposits that i had to
make at 88 poke over the last two months
and the overall card distribution of
which i clearly felt that it wasn't in
my way on all sides so nothing personal

[02:45]
my way on all sides so nothing personal
towards 888 here
i decided to dive into my database and
do some analysis and i was actually
pleasantly surprised with what i saw
so we met our goal for 15k hands a month
last month i think we played 10k
handsome this month we played 20k hands

[03:02]
handsome this month we played 20k hands
the average stake will still need to go
up in order to reach our goals but like
i said weren't running that bad i also
didn't think i played
great so usually not conditions in which
you should be taking a lot of shots but

[03:16]
you should be taking a lot of shots but
breaking down these last two months we
played 728 hands of heads up poker in
which i somehow managed to lose 7.5 k
which is quite weird because
the only times i actually play as up is
when a six max table breaks and we

[03:32]
when a six max table breaks and we
exchange the button or it's in the case
where efficiently joins me and he wants
to play a couple of hands heads up and
it takes a couple of hands before other
regulars joined the table now i do
remember that there were two hands where

[03:46]
remember that there were two hands where
i think we exchanged buttons and i
managed to lose two stacks surprisingly
this was on a day poker
one of them was actually quite
interesting
so this was actually the first one i
call a trivet with ace nine flopped two
pair

[04:00]
pair
and basically
yeah he checked jammed the turn he had
ace king
so that was quite unfortunate and then
the hand after that
we get dealt
pocket sevens we call on the big blind

[04:15]
pocket sevens we call on the big blind
we flop a set
happy life we play it fast and we
actually face a three bet on the flop
which you know is pretty
interesting
we can actually take a look at a solver
to see if this would be a thing

[04:32]
to see if this would be a thing
so we checked towards the small blind i
wanted to say button but obviously we're
playing heads up see if it's one third
i would say we probably have a mandatory
race somewhere
on the bigger side i think it went three
quarters looks like pot is more of a

[04:46]
quarters looks like pot is more of a
preferred sizing we should actually
tribute this hand most of the time
pre-flop
so we went for the check race okay i'll
click pot
and in position should do
no three betting whatsoever

[05:00]
no three betting whatsoever
let me see if there's a smaller sizing
also not really a lot of tree betting i
think a hand
made sense would be like third pair let
me see
second pair third pair
so yeah like a seven nine like a king

[05:16]
so yeah like a seven nine like a king
seven an a7 something that blocks some
value and let's say we have a hand like
jack eight that has quite a lot of
equity versus a hand like a7 so i think
a7 was one of the hands that i thought
he could find
um to take this three bed line with but

[05:32]
um to take this three bed line with but
basically we're going in a line that is
going to be very uncommon and not really
theoretically approved obviously it
happens a low frequency but but i would
say most people then find this play too
often

[05:45]
often
so now it's up to us i decide to call
the turn is an 8 and i actually now
decided to do something funky i actually
decided to lead
um
i think an eight in general should
improve my range i don't think he should
really

[06:00]
really
throw at the flop with a hand like jack
nine as he doesn't want the three bet
and me jamming in pocket sevens and
daddy has to fold so
jack nine is definitely a hand that we
can have in a range um i guess queen
eight we could sometimes have in our

[06:15]
eight we could sometimes have in our
range i guess six nine suited we could
have in our range so i thought that the
eight would be a range of proof of cards
for me let's say we did have a head like
queen jack that hand now improves and i
just did not really want him to
be able to putt control i figured that

[06:32]
be able to putt control i figured that
we should not be going in check on mode
twice and give him the opportunity to
maybe putt control at a certain street
let's say he did three bet he three
better the flop would have like pocket
kings king queen ace queen stuff like
that so i actually decided to come out

[06:46]
that so i actually decided to come out
with a lead bluff obviously is also way
that's likely because we have two sevens
let's say i had queen 10 i would never
lead the turn because then i think he
just has too many seven x that he could
have as a bluff and we block all of the
hands that we are

[07:00]
hands that we are
in this case with pocket sevens leading
into that to prevent them from pot
controlling
now river is a great card i jam and
obviously now we should mainly have the
best hand however he had pocket queens
which is

[07:16]
which is
i would say probably the last hand that
i would want to three bet the flop with
okay so these were two hands that
obviously when you're in a downswing and
you're just playing two buttons to close
the table can definitely irritate you
especially given the way he played his

[07:30]
especially given the way he played his
hand now roughly 25 of my volume was
played three to four-handed which
usually means that there's no
recreational player at the tables it's
just rex battling it out it went quite
well on 1k however as we can see here we

[07:46]
well on 1k however as we can see here we
slide we ended up slightly losing and
money wise we ended up losing quite a
bit and this is because the small sample
that i played on 2k we rank quite bad
mainly in pre-flop or wins
obviously you know you could say that on

[08:01]
obviously you know you could say that on
2k there's a couple of lineups where the
opposition is going to be a little bit
tougher but not minus 65 bb tougher i
think that was around the win rate i was
winning at 2k 3 to 4 handed

[08:15]
winning at 2k 3 to 4 handed
but i would mainly also say that it were
mainly the same players that i was
playing against if it was a lineup where
there's only guys who played 2k plus i
would have probably gotten out of the
way unless i really felt like playing
and then obviously the rest of the

[08:30]
and then obviously the rest of the
volume is played five to six ended which
are going to be most of your volume and
in that actually we did quite well with
the evb 100 of 7bb
in some other analysis i also found out
that basically going all in is not

[08:45]
that basically going all in is not
really working out for me
these win rates here as you can see
already in all in eevee you can already
see the variance but in general even if
ebb be a hundred preflop awareness
you're supposed to win way more money i
looked at my stack off there was one
hand that was quite dubious but all

[09:01]
hand that was quite dubious but all
around i would say in pre-flip point
situations over the last two months the
card distribution has not been in my
favor
and as i mentioned i often saw this
happening at 2k in the three and four
handed games also investing in four bad

[09:15]
handed games also investing in four bad
pots did not go my way usually not a
great indicator of success if you invest
in four by pots you usually want to win
it and as you can see here my win rates
are quite low the average win rate
should be way higher so this is again an
example of how i look at variants in my

[09:31]
example of how i look at variants in my
game
other than just all nev
and i do actually also remember getting
tired of four betting pocket kings ace
on the flop pocket kings ace in the flop
pocket kings ace and the flop i actually
looked it happened like five times

[09:45]
looked it happened like five times
which is obviously quite frustrating
also when i called for bats i did manage
to make a couple of strong hands or when
i had jacks and the board came nicely 10
high obviously the other guy just had
kinks so in general in the bigger pots

[10:00]
kinks so in general in the bigger pots
things were just not going in my favor
nothing we can really do about it and
then there are some other scenarios that
also again you don't really see if you
just look at all any v and even if you
do more filtering it's quite hard to
spot out this variance but i notice a
lot of worst case scenarios happening i

[10:17]
lot of worst case scenarios happening i
make a strong hand i raise the river
nine out of ten times you know he's just
gonna call me win a lot of money and
then one out of ten times he's gonna jam
and
i recall many times that i had to raise
fold or race call very strong hands

[10:31]
fold or race call very strong hands
where basically i ran into an even
stronger hand so i love these situations
where just the ev of being in a scenario
is quite high but there is maybe a five
percent or ten percent chance that
you're actually going to end up being
indifferent those scenarios happened

[10:47]
indifferent those scenarios happened
quite frequently unfortunately which is
not really something that you will see
back in onv or even in the filters that
i'm running
now if you guys want to learn more about
how to filter your game for variants so

[11:01]
how to filter your game for variants so
you can stay mentally sane in the head
or in general if you guys want to
understand how to pluck your games for
leaks these are things that i explain in
our mechanics of poker program link down
below in the description as mentioned i

[11:17]
below in the description as mentioned i
think in the last video where i kind of
explained what i do on a monthly basis i
also mentioned that i take a look at my
stats so i took a look at my stats for
last month and we had a couple of goals
where we mainly wanted to be more
aggressive in some pre-flop spots now in

[11:30]
aggressive in some pre-flop spots now in
most scenarios that worked i remember my
button three bet went up a little bit my
four bet percentages went up a little
bit but there's this one spot that i
just cannot seem to get up okay usually
i don't have any trouble getting it up

[11:46]
but when it comes down to squeeze
percentage
it's been hunting me throughout my
career that i just cannot get that
percentage up so again i'm going to try
to focus on it i've looked at the ranges
i've made filters to look at it after my

[12:00]
i've made filters to look at it after my
session but i just keep on missing the
spots even though i actually noticed in
game like hey this is actually one two
spots and i did feel like i grabbed on
more squeeze opportunities stats wise it
still showed that i was still not
reaching an optimal percentage in that
spot

[12:17]
now as i mentioned i was a little bit
surprised when i saw my results i
thought we were doing way worse however
you know evbr4 and an actual bb of one

[12:30]
you know evbr4 and an actual bb of one
in three to six handed games is quite
decent do think there's room for
improvement but it's not as bad as i
thought things were going
now i don't think i handled the if we
can call it downswing that well
i noticed there were quite some mistakes

[12:46]
i noticed there were quite some mistakes
that i was making due to the fact that i
was in a bit of a pessimistic mindset
there were decisions that i made which
were influenced by i would say fear of
losing and actually wanted to share a
couple of hands with you guys where this

[13:01]
couple of hands with you guys where this
came up
so i'm going to use this hand as the
main example we open king queen of suit
on the button flop comes queen jack four
two tone i decide
to over bat

[13:15]
to over bat
villain calls
turn is an eight
he checks i checked behind
and the river is a queen and he now
blocks
and we call we should erase the river i
think ass blade the rest of the hand is

[13:31]
think ass blade the rest of the hand is
fine
so yeah he showed ace jack
and
i thought this hand was a really
interesting from a mental game
perspective and i will not show you guys
why now rationally speaking i understand

[13:45]
why now rationally speaking i understand
what's going on and i would spot it in
game and try to override it logically
however
i kept on making the same mistakes and
when you keep on having difficulties
what do you do
if you have a problem if no one else can
help and if you can find them maybe you

[14:00]
help and if you can find them maybe you
can hire the a-team
[Music]
okay i didn't have the a-team to my
disposal however i did have adam
carmichael mindset and performance coach

[14:17]
carmichael mindset and performance coach
but you can see the confusion right
we talked about some interesting stuff
regarding the emotions that came up
while playing these hands and in general
why i couldn't think my way out of these
situations i did a session with him and

[14:32]
situations i did a session with him and
i want to share a couple of clips from
that session with you guys then what we
try to do is we try to use logic to tell
that feeling it's wrong and that we
should be okay with it it doesn't work
because whenever this primal unsafe

[14:45]
because whenever this primal unsafe
feeling that unsafeness wants to feel
safe all right so when you feel unsafe
it's really really hard to get yourself
to do something that is deemed risky by
the mind of the body all right so what
we need to do is we get very clear
what's happening in these moments what
is this unsafe feeling all right so

[15:01]
is this unsafe feeling all right so
feelings i will say feelings need to be
felt all right so you need to get to a
point where you're like okay i'm feeling
unsafe in this moment i know this
because i'm going to passive lines i
know it's because i can feel like a
sense of fear but what is this unsafe
feeling all right so i think it'd be
really good to go back through all three

[15:15]
really good to go back through all three
of the hands that you've sent me because
i think they're all really powerful
hands and that's when i get clear on
what is it feeling like so at what
moment do you notice something's wrong
what's the signature you're feeling in
your body and what are the early warning
signs all right so if we go through each
of them and that will give us a signal

[15:30]
of them and that will give us a signal
of what's going on in your body and
hopefully we can identify a moment where
it's like ah when i feel these things
that is unsafe then we can try to see
how the minds interact with that every i
think we're really good to uh to
basically understand how you're feeling
in each moment that

[15:45]
in each moment that
queen hands yeah the king queen hands
all right so do you want to walk me
through that hand and when you felt like
something that you noticed something was
different all right so you're playing
this hand it was pretty standard yeah if
you just want me for the hands how you
felt during it
there's a couple of factors involved pod

[16:01]
there's a couple of factors involved pod
gets bigger
spot gets more connected the board gets
more connected
so there's uh there's there's a future
threat out there
and that basically already
i would say triggers some arousal yeah

[16:15]
i would say triggers some arousal yeah
um
like both logically it's uh i think the
turn is is a is a clear check
uh with the king queen but oh the arouse
already kicks in because i'm starting to
build a big pot a bad card comes on the
turn and then basically

[16:32]
turn and then basically
i'm already projecting like oh i hope
this card doesn't happen oh i hope it's
my might i guess i might automatically
goes a bit to the future and all the
things that could happen okay so turn is
an eight uh let's say it goes now check
check and he over bets okay it's it's a

[16:46]
check and he over bets okay it's it's a
it's a scenario that can happen i think
it's not gonna happen that frequently
but because it can happen in the future
and then i'm up for a decision which you
know in theory is probably just
i feel like we're just going to be
close to indifferent if i look at it

[17:01]
close to indifferent if i look at it
this way
yeah um so let's go back let's go back
to the turn quickly and you said you
noticed maybe some arousal on the turn
so even though because you know this
spot you should be checking more you
know this part has the potential to
escalate so tell me like how that feels
in the body when you're noticing some

[17:16]
in the body when you're noticing some
form of arousal is that your heartbeat
going faster is there a bit of tension
in the body something like how that
generally feels for you when you're
noticing some arousal on the body
i'm trying to uh re-lift the head yeah

[17:31]
i'm trying to uh re-lift the head yeah
i i feel mainly in my belly but it's
hard it's hard it's hard to describe
exactly
um
and then when it actually happened i
feel more in my throat
okay
yeah so the anticipation of it is more
in my belly and then when it actually

[17:45]
in my belly and then when it actually
happened it becomes more of a throat
finger you know like
and then yeah
and then like i said then when it does
happen like i said 50 of my capacity of
thinking logic is already gone because
it's like oh why does this happen

[18:03]
this is exactly what i didn't want to
happen you know all these things that
are very not not not useful uh yeah yeah
yeah so we've got there like quite a
trick a quick kind of cascade of events
so we've got a feel on the belly which
is generally kind of like not a tension

[18:16]
is generally kind of like not a tension
in the body in the belly that's
generally fear that's your body almost
like holding on going oh that's trying
to almost like control the situation
the release of that fear but also like
uh yeah the throat can be like a lot of
different emotions there and then we've
got the mind being active so tell me

[18:31]
got the mind being active so tell me
through when you notice the mind being
active how is it different so i know
you're a very logical person you've got
a very clear way of thinking in hands so
i'm guessing in these kind of spots that
usual framework of thinking gets a bit
disrupted so something for like
something
it's gone

[18:46]
it's gone
okay
with a little bit of luck uh you know
one piece of logic remains uh
okay
some of the differences the differences
you notice and the thought processes in
these kind of moments
you mean the

[19:00]
you mean the
for example when i'm not in a downswing
and then i'm just playing well uh when i
have more confidence i want to know yeah
i want to know like in this moment when
things aren't going okay no one thinks
no i was explaining like the difference
basically okay so
but but let's say for example just to

[19:15]
but but let's say for example just to
keep it in this moment
um
for example when he bets the river small
and this is also a trend
like i can just call
and have the feeling go away
basically means the hand is gone

[19:31]
basically means the hand is gone
okay yeah so if if if i can rush to
showdown in a certain way that's my
checking behind or that's just my
calling
and then basically the fear
is gone or at least you know i'm out of
that arousal state that the hand has
triggered me to be in

[19:45]
triggered me to be in
i usually go for that option so here
it's just like okay if i call i have no
more future headaches okay that's that's
just the fact if i call the hand is over
there's no more future headaches right
but it's not the most plus if you play
because the most positive play is

[20:00]
because the most positive play is
clearly a race um
i think i even wrote it down here that
it's
analyzing it was at least
12 bp or something
yeah around around 12 bb ev well that's
it's quite big

[20:15]
it's quite big
uh
but like i don't see that if he to be
fair let's say he then does jam and i'm
in a state where i make a bad decision
maybe the race is even is even
is even not plus v i don't know it's
it's really depends on what you then do
in the worst case scenario right

[20:31]
in the worst case scenario right
yeah
so like i said then i try to avoid that
situation
yeah so
so let's see let's say you were in that
moment let's say you were able to stay
present and you were able to feel that

[20:46]
present and you were able to feel that
fee on the stomach not in the belly
you're able to feel that almost like
tension in the throat that your opponent
puts a bit on the river and you can feel
yourself wanting to end the hand now
just get it off with call and avoid the
future scenarios let's just say you were

[21:02]
future scenarios let's just say you were
to override that in in game
what is it that you're afraid of all
right so obviously we can say like him
re-raising getting the money in what is
it about that that feels unsafe all
right so like say your opponent puts you
in a spot where you're not comfortable

[21:15]
in a spot where you're not comfortable
and you might make a blunder you might
make a mistake what is it about being in
that kind of spot
that creates some sort of fear what is
it you're actually afraid of in those
moments
yeah like i would say the two things
like i'm afraid i'm beat and i'm afraid
that worst case scenario happens like

[21:32]
that worst case scenario happens like
yeah because in this case you know
that's why i think this hands are
interesting because you're reopening the
action with the race
yeah so you are not you are not and
yeah i would say what if it kind of

[21:45]
yeah i would say what if it kind of
comes to my mind right what if wha what
if
it's i guess i guess the dealing with
the uncertainty that the alternative
line
uh
offers you or gives yes
yes and i think it all comes down in the

[22:00]
yes and i think it all comes down in the
long term to being confident to be able
to handle these tough spots yeah it's
gonna be perfect there is gonna be some
mistakes there so why because obviously
you play poke for a long time you're
very confident in your game you can
think on the fly
why do you feel like why for some reason

[22:15]
why do you feel like why for some reason
is your body telling you that if he
re-raises you're gonna make a blunder
all right let's say you do you do do
arrears and he does
okay the first the first thing the first
thing that comes up yeah because you've
been blundering all the time
so yeah it's like like i said it's it's

[22:31]
so yeah it's like like i said it's it's
a series of events when i make
bad decisions
uh yeah
and you know
obviously
bad decision is quote quote
um
but it feels like extra bad because

[22:46]
but it feels like extra bad because
nothing is working out right we're in it
we're in a downswing so our
yeah like i said basically
the trust in our decisions is is quite
low
yeah right yes yes

[23:00]
yeah right yes yes
so yeah yeah
yeah so why don't i have trust yeah
because the record is showing that
currently uh i'm not making great
decisions
yeah yeah exactly no i get it and it's
it's really hard to go while you just
have more trust have more confidence it
doesn't work that way all right so when

[23:15]
doesn't work that way all right so when
we look at the spot obviously outside
the game it's very easy to make like the
assessments we can basically even like
say he re-raises so so you raise the
river and he jams you all in either one
of three things either he's over
bluffing and call more he's under
bluffing fold your range or he's

[23:30]
bluffing fold your range or he's
somewhere balanced all right
whatever where you want to go for that
line the kind of repercussions of
getting that wrong how bad are they okay
let's have a think about it so i see
yeah
but like these kind of spots are always
potential blunder spots because there's

[23:46]
potential blunder spots because there's
no one in the world that's perfectly
balanced so everyone is over or under
bluffing yeah and now it's up to me to
figure out what it is
and like i said let's say for example i
am against a guy that's
very much outside of uh

[24:01]
very much outside of uh
population right he's clearly over
passive or he's clearly over aggressive
i would say the overpassive one is the
easiest one then you just always
if he jams your confidence very high in
that spot so you don't mind getting into
the spot if he's over aggressive
i would say there's a scenario

[24:17]
i would say there's a scenario
where i would still call just because i
don't want to call off my stack and have
the possibility
there that i lose it
okay so that's i would say it's clearly
a flaw
when you're in a bit of a better state

[24:30]
when you're in a bit of a better state
i've seen myself in this kind of
situation be very happy making the race
making a
even making like a more thin race um
hoping that he jams it in sort of right
yeah i think that's the the beauty of
polka there's always going to be this

[24:45]
polka there's always going to be this
seat of doubt unsure of completely what
the line is and it's the ability to put
yourself in the plus cb line regardless
of like where it could lead to so yeah i
think for you it's like yeah we'll do
relative hands and look through them but
obviously there's this element of not

[25:00]
obviously there's this element of not
wanting to put yourself in certain
situations not wanting to put yourself
in spots all coming down to a fear of
what could happen in the future and
generally the worst case scenario and
your fear is that you'll make a blunder
in a worst case scenario when there's a
lot of chips on the line

[25:16]
lot of chips on the line
i think that that's that fear has not
really come from the accurate players
but fears are not necessarily accurate
and they are very hard to rationalize
when we have a theater we can't just use
rationale to get rid of it i've already
tried that then

[25:30]
tried that then
yeah yeah yeah yeah but i think the
solution right
yeah go on
the solution is right they are very
comfortable with what the fears feel
like all right it's in the moment to be
able to sit with a fear all right so for
you we've got this feeling the belly
we've got this feeling in the throat and

[25:45]
we've got this feeling in the throat and
then we've got the mind also being very
active and at the moment the way you're
handling that is you're going for an
avoidance strategy or a in the hand here
strategy because this feeling you want
rid of it you don't you don't want to be
here and you feel like anything you do

[26:00]
here and you feel like anything you do
that could magnify the feeling that
could put you in more situations where
the feeling gets worse avoid avoid avoid
a void what we need to get good at is
feeling the moment as you're in game i
go oh here we go fear oh this means it's
an unknown spot which i'm unsure about
oh pay attention to how i'm reacting

[26:16]
oh pay attention to how i'm reacting
here i'm probably going to go for a
passive line here okay can i feel it the
body in my emotion i'm feeling okay it's
in the stomach oh i don't want to race
here i can notice myself not wanting to
raise ah and then we'd be in the moment
could be in the feeling and use whatever

[26:31]
could be in the feeling and use whatever
line we're going to use in that moment
so it's it comes back to a point where
we need to acknowledge the fear
acknowledge that this is a scenario
where my body has tagged it as unsafe
unsafe i'm getting this visceral
reaction and if i don't watch this
reaction i will act very primally which

[26:47]
reaction i will act very primally which
will protect my feelings and my emotions
which will often not be the best
for me in the moment so we'll go over
the other two examples we'll see if in
all the scenarios a similar sort of
feeling it's starting to come up because
then we can get very in touch with how
it's feeling we can look at the arousal

[27:01]
it's feeling we can look at the arousal
levels in the body and we can look at
how that's impacting you when we become
solutions to a center of the body in
those moments super stuff the whole
session was really useful and helped me
better deal with my emotions while
playing after this call i took things

[27:16]
playing after this call i took things
even further and got in touch with a
therapist because a lot of the stuff
that i was feeling wasn't necessarily
new to me i noticed that throughout my
career i have always been dealing with
emotions similar to this
i would always find a way to work around

[27:32]
i would always find a way to work around
it or to deal with it but obviously it
would be great to understand what is the
root cause and try to resolve it from
there so these emotions don't get
triggered in certain situations and i
don't have to waste energy fighting them

[27:45]
don't have to waste energy fighting them
now talking to a therapist was already
on my list for quite some time however
the necessity never really reached the
point to which i would take action so
this was the opportunity to take this
necessity book a session and dig deeper
because in general if you find yourself

[28:00]
because in general if you find yourself
in a situation like in this example the
hand that i played while i was in a
downswing and you feel more emotion than
rationally speaking you think you should
be feeling at that moment usually it's
the event that triggers accumulated

[28:16]
the event that triggers accumulated
emotion which is something to do with a
past event that happened in your life
now i don't have the recording of this
session and it would actually be quite
useless for you guys as it was in dutch
and dutch is not really the most common
spoken language but i'll give you guys a

[28:31]
spoken language but i'll give you guys a
quick summary so i wrote down all the
problems that i'm struggling with
and one of the points that i wrote down
is that throughout my career especially
when i became more successful i always
struggled a little bit with that reality

[28:45]
struggled a little bit with that reality
as the way i was grow up i wasn't really
prepared to be very successful then when
you do suddenly become successful it's a
reality that is not in line with your
conditioning that usually leads to
something interesting

[29:00]
something interesting
for example i was not considered smart
when i was younger i was diagnosed with
adhd and the way i understood that at
that moment is that a part of my brain
wasn't working
on top of that throughout my
lower school high school a lot of

[29:16]
lower school high school a lot of
teachers would put me separate from the
other kids so you had the kids in the
classroom and they put me in a desk next
to the teacher aka i was being primed
with you are different than the rest not
necessarily in a positive way and this

[29:30]
necessarily in a positive way and this
was if i was even welcoming the class in
the first place okay also feedback and
recommendations of teachers were usually
not very positive so it wasn't only
speech but also actions that planted
this conditioning in my head

[29:46]
this conditioning in my head
and i actually always used my history as
a story that i thought was empowering
for maybe some of you guys watching as i
would say listen i wasn't that smart but
i still made it and
reflecting back on that sentence that's

[30:00]
reflecting back on that sentence that's
pretty [ __ ] up basically the
conditioning from other people was so
far in my head that i actually started
to believe in it so the conditioning
that i had from when i was little is
that basically that i sucked or as we
labeled it in therapy is that i was a
failure now everyone has gotten certain

[30:16]
failure now everyone has gotten certain
conditionings imprinted into them from
when they were younger and these
conditionings will usually determine how
you view and act i actually explained
this process as part of our webinar
series and how to become a more

[30:31]
series and how to become a more
successful poker player so if you're
interested in that link it down below
so to link this now to poker as you're
probably thinking okay wacko renee sorry
for your youth traumas but what the [ __ ]
does this have to do with the hands that
you just showed me

[30:45]
you just showed me
well basically when i start losing or
when i'm in a downswing it's not only
the negative feelings that
most people have when they're in a
downswing but it's also the accumulated
emotion from past events so basically if

[31:01]
emotion from past events so basically if
i start losing or get into a downswing
or make mistakes etc i am a failure
or at least unconsciously i feel that
and the more this gets triggered the
harder it becomes to think rationally in

[31:16]
harder it becomes to think rationally in
a hand because emotions clutter your
ability to think rationally and instead
of welcoming these emotions or as
benaboo did in the mechanics of poker
podcast sitting with these emotions my
automatic response is to try to get away

[31:31]
automatic response is to try to get away
from these emotions as soon as possible
which i'm sure sounds familiar because
no one likes to feel uncomfortable and
how does that come out in a poker hand
well i might just rush through the hand
to try to get the showdown get the hand
over with i might just fold at the
earlier street i might only call instead

[31:47]
earlier street i might only call instead
of race i thought the king queen hand is
a great example of that
raising
keeps me in that state whereas if i just
call the hand is over the emotions go
away this is a great example of how

[32:00]
away this is a great example of how
mental game or this case even a certain
conditioning influenced the way i play
the hand now the solution to this is not
study more solvers i understand that we
should obviously raise the river but at
that moment again like i said
i wasn't able to think rationally

[32:15]
i wasn't able to think rationally
because my mind was cluttered by
emotions
leading to me taking a sub optimal line
another thing that
i was pointed out in the session
that another way i try to avoid getting
this feeling is by overly studying

[32:31]
this feeling is by overly studying
overly preparing for sessions basically
i try to do anything in my power in
order to not fail
or in this case feel like a failure as
these would trigger certain feelings
that i'm trying to avoid from when i was

[32:45]
that i'm trying to avoid from when i was
younger now obviously this also has some
positive attributes right making sure
you prepare well making sure you study a
lot however it's the excessive over the
overly in that sentence that is the
problem and i think this has cost me

[33:00]
problem and i think this has cost me
quite some volume throughout my poker i
would say volume has always been a leak
of mine throughout my whole career and i
now have a better understanding of why
that is now i hope that by breaking this
down and sharing my story you start to
realize why mental game can be so

[33:15]
realize why mental game can be so
important now this is obviously not the
case for everyone as the degree in which
mental game influences your performance
varies per person but do check for
yourself if anything that i just said
sounds relatable to you

[33:32]
we made good progress in volume 20k
hands which puts us right at our target
we made good progress in mental game and
i was really happy with how my stats
looked over the last two months of
playing so all around i'm a happy guy

[33:46]
playing so all around i'm a happy guy
content wise for poker ambition as i
said we changed some things up we rolled
that out we made some watcher move clips
on instagram we made play and explain
videos and we've done more podcasts so
subscribe to the channel to not miss out
on those i'm going to spend the rest of

[34:01]
on those i'm going to spend the rest of
this week when this video came out
working on the master class of facing a
3-bet while you're out of position which
should be released in a couple of weeks
the main point for improvement is to get

[34:15]
the main point for improvement is to get
less overwhelmed and be more welcoming
for the emotions that come up around
losing mainly doing this by accepting
the emotions as adam explained in our
coaching session i should also be on the
lookout for certain behavior which is
related to extensively doing something

[34:32]
related to extensively doing something
in order to avoid these emotions around
failing technically an improvement point
that i want to work on for the next two
months is spot when i play strong hands
especially
but in general when i start to play too

[34:46]
but in general when i start to play too
tricky and a bit too fancy and it's
basically the same procedure i'm gonna
try to identify mistakes from a
theoretical perspective by marking hands
and reviewing them in solvers and then
the mistakes that keep on occurring even
though i rationally understand why for

[35:02]
though i rationally understand why for
example a solver doesn't want to do that
i will dive into a mental hand history
and try to look at the flaw and maybe do
another session with adam to really dig
into the root cause which leads me to
want to play tricky because to me it

[35:15]
want to play tricky because to me it
feels more rewarding when i get a
stacking in a way that i sort of
deserve the money i induced a bluff
right or when there is a low frequency
play that i can spot so these are
clearly flaws i mean when i'm saying
this out loud i know it's pretty flawed

[35:31]
this out loud i know it's pretty flawed
but apparently i have a desire to win
money that way whereas just stacking
someone in a normal way you know a line
that basically anyone would just take
with a strong hand okay i have a strange
hand let's go bum my mom get the money
in that i think then feels less

[35:45]
in that i think then feels less
rewarding for me but like i said over
the next few months i want to dig a
little bit deeper gather more hands and
dig into my thought processes to see
where the flaw is and try to fix it now
in this upcoming month i will have less
time
as i will go on a small snowboard trip

[36:00]
as i will go on a small snowboard trip
with the family and at the end of march
i'll be going to brazil for two weeks so
most probably the next update will be
two months from now so let's see if we
managed to improve in the areas we
listed so overall lots of stuff to be
excited for i'm really looking forward

[36:16]
excited for i'm really looking forward
to make continuous progress and i'm
curious what you guys are going to be
working on tell me how did your month go
what went well what could have gone
better what are you trying to improve
for the upcoming month
