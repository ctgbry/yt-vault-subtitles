you still value betting thinly usually
what you see with recreationals is that
they kind of forget the value but

what's up guys
we're jumping uh
straight into the action it sounds quite
close
nines and we definitely go
something weird has happened don't ask
me why but if i fold we still see our
hand
hey advice would have worked
oh don't jinx it
ah let's show the olympia mp
play with this guy before
he's pretty crazy in the hatta
let's uh do let's play some alternative
strategies here
i'm obviously in guys come on four big
blinds let's go flush draw nuts
nuts nuts nuts
pot
close with
this guy's pretty crazy
i think i'm just gonna get it in
i think i have a lot of fault equity
it's not full stacked
i don't really want to get bluffed
don't think he's got a bad fold ace jack
or something though that is the problem
so it's ace ten wow that's very unlucky
hey gg sir gg sir
i just think we have so much fault
equity and obviously equity on gold is
quite good and here i overcalled king
five suited
with this guy in a pot we flop a pair
that's usually a good hand
where's this him
he bets again
ace deuce
but that part is ours that is gonna be
interesting dave i have a feeling i have
a feeling we're gonna we're gonna zoom
in in this table a little bit
especially getting uh because we're
gonna play some alternative strategies
here here we call the gold four bet with
the ace king off
he's gone the flop
unfortunately we have a heart which is
not good
he checks
i check
green on the river that's a very bad car
checks
on the river yeah let's give ourselves a
little chicken song there
[Music]
hello can i use your pictures to tindler
so i can finally get some matches
i mean
fine with me mate
actually a friend of mine
i saw in her group chat
that uh it's already i think the second
time
that a girl
sends him a message like look who i
found on tinder like a random guy and
they use his pictures
compliment for the guy
of course
quite interesting so you know i think
they call it catfishing right
but then what do you do if you get the
date
like as far as i know technology isn't
that far that you can digitally stick
your penis into something right so at
some point you know you have to meet a
person here we decided to go for a
little three but with the 5'4 against
our friend sweden's hero
we go for a check race let me think
i don't mind actually a check race
let's put him put him to the aggression
to the test with some aggression
if we get it in you know he's probably
gonna have tens or something and then we
still do fine
also a hard hand to uh
to check all done with so let's improve
our red line a little bit maybe we can
even make him hero fold something if the
turn is a high card or something
oh he has a set
worst case scenario
and we lose
not a stack that's why the play also was
so nice
i was calling here with the king jack
good
turn as we're now improving versus
pocket aces
because for a block which i think is an
okay strategy
we're still blocking
ace jack which is good we're blocking
obviously ace king
he can sometimes bet the same hand
so i do think we have an easy call again
and same with iffy betsy river versus
block i think i'm still just gonna call
we have some kington suited we have king
queen suited which are actually all very
few combos
not really sure
not really sure like on one side king
jack
like ace jack
he will have more boats but then he will
always have
some more king x so i think just raising
age jack
plus and then being more bluff-heavy
with the race i think is good
ace king i would definitely race i'm not
really sure maybe maybe king jackets
already race not sure
burning here with the king seven
[Music]
i just think this guy is gonna be quite
loose
like nine deuce off for example
so i think just applying some more
pressure
and reverb when you flush is completed
this trade is complete so we'll go from
what botany faults guys
give it to me baby
give me [ __ ] what the [ __ ]
if you want to have a better
understanding of what's going on in
these videos in our mechanics and poker
program we focus on when and why certain
strategy generates highest ev and how to
perform more consistently at the poker
tables so you can get a deeper
understanding of how poker really works
and how to get more success in poker so
do you want over 30k dollar worth of
value go over to the site and join our
mechanics of poker program
while we make a little
over bet here on the flop
i'm gonna go for it turn check
very few people
are strong enough
to bet it twice after they've been
called
yeah well we did it three times easy car
on the river
and he has king eight well that's an
unfortunate run out of events
you have to be joking i mean
and trying not to be negative but god
damn [ __ ] [ __ ] obviously check
following the 86 but you guys are
probably more interested in the nut
flush roll so when limp called check
i i is probably iso yeah so he isold
obviously check calling here
king hi
let's have some showdown value
this guy can literally have anything
you still value betting thinly usually
what you see with recreationals is that
they kind of forget the value but
and he can have
10 7 off suit [ __ ]
queen deuce offsuit
thank you very much sir
how sick is that
i'm a genius
oh my god
that's got to be the greatest call in
poker some other youtube stuff coming up
i played in a live game recently
and we're gonna review some hands that i
played on that
i game it's gonna be a two-parter as
there were quite some interesting hands
also guys
the people who don't follow mr nick it
was nick eastwood aka isti
recorded a little uh he has a nice
theory on youtube called punt or no pump
where basically i send him over a couple
of hands
and uh he's going to evaluate them and
then tell me if he thought it was a punt
or no punt
seems uh
seems to be a series that uh that is
sort of made for me
and he was uh he was pleasantly
surprised not necessarily surprised he
was pla he was very content with the
hands that i sent him it was a very uh
very cool
it's going to be a very cool youtube
video actually it's going to be a
two-part
as we were talking for quite some time
so make sure to keep an eye out on his
channel as well out of a little overbear
here with the queen tip
because interesting turn
so don't mind a barrel with this hand to
be honest
maybe this is overplaying it a little
bit
but i do think that if he has just a
bare ace he's in quite a tough spot
i'm not gonna barrel space i think
spades are literally the worst
the worst one to baron he called me with
king jack i think that calls a little
bit light-ish on the turn
you know maybe eight is a little bit too
loose
but that obviously depends on the flop
like if you flop a boat
then i think the pew is fine
if you don't flop a boat then obviously
you know you should maybe reconsider
come on dennis
this is your moment
do something funky
this is the moment
that you throw your stack in
this is the moment actually considered a
little donkey donkey he already does it
for me
oh
dennis
my good friend
we have
a set here as well and a straight flush
and i don't know what else is going on
please go
and here
i think we're calling
i think we're just hoping
ah that's good my friend
that's very nice it's very nice me like
it very much yeah thank you very much
now does he think we're crazy enough
just rip it in now
does he think we're crazy enough
does he think we are crazy enough
hey folds
people i think mistakingly
uh not bluff these type of players
i think the king seven earlier was a
good example where i think the right
adjustment versus guys who are i mean he
was raising the queen dudes off so he's
playing probably 80 percent plus of his
hands
the correct adjustment is that you
should actually be
aggressive back
because they're just too white
because of the bat i'm just gonna call
and let them do something funky
continues betting we're obviously still
in it
we do have one we do add one did have do
have
i'm confused
one sort of bad sizing tail on him when
he would size down so let's say if he
would have bet 1 30 or on the turn i
would have definitely raced because last
time but that was like a mediocre type
of hand
now he checks back to prayer
so this kind of confirms my hero call
with king deuce that they sometimes
forget to value that is that type of
recreational
over but
over bed flop check turn
i'm gonna make a small bet here on the
river i think there's a chance that he
might have a nine or something
he calls
two sixes
all right
all right all right senor
here sweden leads out we're gonna call
we're really playing a live game guys we
are playing a live game it's on
it is on
we are playing live
kolkata stream at me again the
[ __ ]
i limp erased call call call call call
call
oh you improve to a king
and feeding dunks out again we're
obviously calling
don't ask me what the [ __ ] is going on
because i have no clue
got a race
oh sweden
sweden sweden what are you doing my
friend
this pretty girl doesn't have a nut
flush draw
yeah that was very likely out of the
other set
right you just called with ace clean
pre-flop
your face is a very big bet
gonna come
interesting turn
let me go for a check
feel the power
you feel my power baby
come on on your bike on your bike
debating if i want to limp re-raise this
probably i do versus him
this is like ace queen versus a more
normal opponent so
yeah we should
obviously try to be in it
and i think on this flop i'm gonna start
with a check
and put our helmet face on
good turn
actually that's not true very bad turn
that's we now chop
there's an ace
[Music]
he doesn't bite he doesn't bite that is
unfortunate
yeah deuce six suited
son i would tell you this much son i
would never have put more 3 000 with two
tons well here we go i was gonna say
idiot players call races with queen 10
they don't even know how to spell poker
i mean
they stream sponsored by donus yes it is
i guess we
could have won more
can't complain
let's try not to
that's what they call a good turn
mercury
well thank you very much sir
thank you very much give it to me baby
give me [ __ ] what the [ __ ]
a little check rates
crazy crazy raisin
go for check
if it's hotspot
i call
yes weka we can see that as well
ec is raining with a party 109 thank you
very much mr eastie welcome guys
as you can see we have a straight but
there's also flush possibilities
it's usually a bad sign huh
especially if you play against a guy
like mr tutti
oh
always mr tutti
yeah he says he has a flush oh really
but we would much rather call with a
hand with a spade in it but the problem
is how many of those do we actually have
it just has the nuts
