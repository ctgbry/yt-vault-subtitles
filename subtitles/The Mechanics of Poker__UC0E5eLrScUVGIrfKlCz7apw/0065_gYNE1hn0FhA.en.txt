[00:00]
i would say the correct place just to
jam
so that's all right we're gonna do
and he has ace nine guys he has ace nine
thank you very much feel the power

[00:16]
thank you very much feel the power
[Music]
do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo all right all right

[00:33]
one hour demo all right all right
first double check if the delay is on
[Music]
that was a tip since the last session i
did without delay
oh it's a good vlog

[00:53]
gonna check could also decide to lead
out but the guy is
quite aggressive

[01:00]
actually i think with this end i'm just
not really sure i think
just
letting him do his thing is probably
okay as he is like i said he is
quite aggressive so let's just do that

[01:16]
same for the turn i would say just let
him do his thing
i think that is a fine strategy

[01:36]
it checks back it is king
that's the that's kind of the downside
but i think
this guy in general is aggressive enough

[01:45]
this guy in general is aggressive enough
to go crazy vadim comes along then
obviously we are in as well
so let's go let's fluff something nice
that is not a bad flop i'm willing to

[02:02]
that is not a bad flop i'm willing to
gamble
i wanted to gamble with these guys i am
willing to gamble guys
buddy we gamble here

[02:15]
can we gamble i don't mind smiggle i
made a gamble man
me was thinking about it sure he's she
always slow play or not
okay well versus only smigo

[02:35]
i am okay just calling
he's thinking about it for quite a long
time also already on the flop so that's
quite interesting
it was for quite a big bet

[02:48]
we have a double open ender and a flush
draw so i don't think we can ever fold
but let's start with call and then maybe
front jam our hits
i don't mind that front jamming our hits

[03:02]
that's not our hit

[03:16]
maybe he gives up with
five six diamonds no we're always going
to lose this now
and it's perfectly fine that is
perfectly fine

[03:34]
i'm curious to see his hand because he's
been timing like hell
and finally he does what we thought he
would do

[03:46]
would do
which is jen good luck good luck from mr
lost paradise guys with all your luck
how can i lose seriously it's just
statistically impossible
okay that is actually statistically
wrong but it's way less likely

[04:00]
wrong but it's way less likely
okay let's keep it that way
there's a pot dunk here on the 88
jack
he said this guy is a little bit crazy i

[04:15]
he said this guy is a little bit crazy i
have a back door i'm going to go for a
call even though i still have someone
behind
now it switches to half pot

[04:36]
a little bit tempted to now just raise
it in a lot of his bloods are going to
have equity
i do think this is maybe a little bit
weaker
like if he has n like queen nine he has

[04:45]
like if he has n like queen nine he has
quite a lot of equity and sometimes
i was gonna say he's gonna call with
worse like a flush draw and
indeed we got him
and that's how we stack him guys that is
how he's thinking
that's how sick is that that's how it is

[05:01]
that's how sick is that that's how it is
how sick is that
oh my god am i the best
10 a minute sit say it you have to say
it so let's say
he had like bucket deuces there or
something random you know maybe
sometimes folds
if he has and like queen 10 you know

[05:16]
if he has and like queen 10 you know
lifeguards gutters
he might sometimes fold that hand which
is good
flop trips and flop a bear
okay actually check raising this some of

[05:30]
okay actually check raising this some of
the time
let's start off with a call
and sorry to call it the 10-9 turn the

[05:50]
flush

[06:00]
i'm gonna go for a small lead here we
face an over bet on the turn
easy call
river is very interesting
i think we have to call mainly because
he can just play the same hand this way

[06:18]
but we do probably also block his bluffs
which i think
are mainly 10 jack on the river
so it's a little bit of a nasty spot but
i don't think we can get away from our
hand
so good luck because i think ace 10

[06:32]
so good luck because i think ace 10
can jam himself so yes ace queen
all right that's unlucky i wouldn't i
think i think just having the 10 there
is better than having a 9 so blocking

[06:46]
is better than having a 9 so blocking
some blobs
but in the same time also sometimes
chopping versus value
got one of our other favorite hands five
six suited
obviously going to be in there
all we have is subscriber joel

[07:01]
all we have is subscriber joel
jolt subscribe for four months jesus
hashtag loyalty that's loyalty right
there
and i'm gonna announce that i'm gonna
quit streaming tomorrow ha
just joking i'm only kidding only

[07:15]
just joking i'm only kidding only
getting my friend
let's start with a little c-bet with the
5-6 suited

[07:30]
5-6 suited
get a call i'm going to probably barrel
the turn
try anything of sizing here
go for a small bed again gonna go for a

[07:58]
go for a small bed again gonna go for a
small bed again on the river

[08:15]
and get called by as10 which is
perfectly fine
airflow to bear frequency is more
important
i would say so yes
kind of check out here first the one
third

[08:32]
actually we have a principle about this
topic coming out today
i wrote a principle this morning about
evs so
you want to know oh know more about that
check it out it's going to be
on i think there's going to be an
instagram post which shows the intro and

[08:46]
instagram post which shows the intro and
then you're
getting forwarded to our blog so make
sure to check that out
here's a go again here with the s5

[09:02]
i'm probably not going anywhere having
the ac clubs

[09:17]
now let's open a little seven deuce why
not let's go guys let's open up the
seven deuce
[Music]
i need to get punished with a three-bed

[09:30]
i need to get punished with a three-bed
[ __ ]
i'm gonna make a forward here with the
ace king oh
that is a good flop that is a good flop
that is a good flop don't you know that
is a flop
a very very good flop and

[09:46]
a very very good flop and
we're gonna do it through a helmet style
and make a check
sure hamlet bets we are pretending
like we have a decision okay

[10:01]
i'm just gonna pretend we have a
decision and call
versus this sizing i'm still going to

[10:16]
race
i would say the correct player is just
to jam
so that's all right we're going to do
and he has ace 9 guys he has ace 9.

[10:30]
and he has ace 9 guys he has ace 9.
thank you very much feel the power
you feel my power baby feel my power
feel my power while we tribute the ace
jack
we go for check me chucky

[10:50]
and i think turn i'm gonna check again
and on the river i think we have a

[11:00]
and on the river i think we have a
volleyball
and as we all learned guys
in friday's high stakes video we're
gonna do a lot of small bedding

[11:16]
okay
and not everyone agrees with small
betting yeah we get caught by ace high

[11:30]
betting yeah we get caught by ace high
not everyone agrees with the small bet
but i mean anyways once he checks
if stefan does it guys if he has a ten
he'll call if not he'll find me that's
my
as easy as that i would just jam here i
think he is
this you're damn [ __ ] god damn it

[11:47]
this you're damn [ __ ] god damn it
why do you do this [ __ ] all the time all
the
[ __ ] time i teach you don't
do those gay bags
why i don't get it why

[12:02]
we know my french you don't like the
small bets pocket aces guys that's more
that's more my style that's how i roll
let's remove this this oh that's a good
flop for pockets

[12:16]
that is a good flaw for pocket issues

[12:36]
do
go for the trap trap trap trapping
see if you said buys let's see if you've

[12:45]
see if you said buys let's see if you've
used that should be
should be social and give me back some
money

[13:03]
no ain't biting okay so we had exactly
the a-stand
the ace with the backdoor spades that
was definitely a hand
that i would lose value from but i don't

[13:16]
that i would lose value from but i don't
think there were that many
would you recommend a micro small stakes
winning player to start at 200 now with
a 700 cash bankroll
this is also something that i'm gonna
add this actually in we're creating a
section on the site where basically all
these kind of questions are gonna get

[13:30]
these kind of questions are gonna get
answered
so i added yours because i always say
the same thing
okay it depends do you have a job
probably you do if you play 25 now with
700 or at least i hope so or you're
living with your parents
if you're living with your parents then
that bankroll is perfectly fine you know

[13:45]
that bankroll is perfectly fine you know
shot all you want it really depends i
would say
aggressive bankroll managed at lower
stakes is always the case
if you are very dependent on your income
when you're playing lower stakes you're
doing something wrong you should
probably just get a part-time job make
sure that covers your base costs and

[14:00]
sure that covers your base costs and
then aggressively shot at lower stakes
with the role that you do have look also
joined the party
so now it's gonna be you and me you and
me
while we look for action bella they all
stopped playing me
why did they all stop i don't get it

[14:18]
why did they all stop i don't get it
why did they all stop guys i think we
have to play some
some 500 zoom okay interesting spot here
basically he limped i i

[14:40]
and he goes all in how is this not asus
how is this not asus

[14:48]
how is it not asus kings
ha sucker ain't falling for them buddy
ain't falling for that ain't falling for
that guys
this is how we dodge bullets baby luck

[15:12]
this is how we dodge bullets baby luck
from brazil

[15:18]
so what you're gonna do what you're
gonna do when the wacko has aces
or you're gonna make a little squeezy
squeezy

[15:30]
oh asus actually have a full house on
the other table but obviously aces is
more interesting definitely checking
if you check stern is interesting he

[15:45]
if you check stern is interesting he
doesn't
owe him oh my god
are you serious what the [ __ ]
can i even play in this game i mean what
the [ __ ] they find oh i mean what the
i mean how can i even play in this game

[16:02]
i mean how can i even play in this game
it's like i just get
cheated i mean hand after hand the whole
board
let me mix in a check here based on over

[16:15]
let me mix in a check here based on over
bet
i think i'm gonna call
but it's close
check the river hope we have the best
hand ace five
yes solid reads weko

[16:32]
yes solid reads weko
saw lid reads

[16:45]
don't induction me bro i ain't falling
for it waiting for that 1k2k blinds in
the limo
get over it on the turn i think i have
an easy call again
the bad run out in terms of

[17:01]
the bad run out in terms of
he could have maybe gone fancy with some
10 jack or 5 6 suited
and now we have a pure bluff catcher

[17:17]
and i think i am going to
fold i would much rather call ace jack
ace 10.
