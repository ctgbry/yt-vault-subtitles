if you're interested go to the site and
i'm looking forward to seeing you in
that kennedy made a mistake here
what is your view on mistakes like i
wanted to dunk by this hand
i should have and then basically when i
missed the donk bet and we're starting
facing
i mean like an ass played scenario and
i'm like okay yeah whatever
i do the same
i know i don't know i no longer want my
mistake to compound into
exactly
i know exactly what you mean
i think i think actually that's quite a
valuable skill what do you think
i feel the same because uh yeah i think
what you're saying is i just gonna feel
more uncomfortable on later streets
because like i still have this id in my
head of oh i could have let the flop or
something yeah uh like it can only embed
that kind of feeling
exactly it's not like it's only gonna
turn into something great we're still
gonna go bomb so actually we're playing
a little bum pod also uh
promotion of bum pod the recreational
ships into us and we have trips seven
four
wait what happens it's like
so basically
how many big ones in the middle of six
or what is it now
we're six and there's thirty in the
middle so that's five yeah
okay
and he has he's dead oh no wait i jinxed
it he's not oh my god
that's a nice jam
what stake is that 5 10 yeah it's 5 10
as well like uh with the small ship with
gg
gonna play gg but yeah i guess uh some
lower stakes i've been playing some ml
100 now even but yeah some some rough
sessions as well
i just want to chill as well just this
is a very tough spot i think sort of
forced to like i would almost prefer it
kind of depends on how he views the spot
i think turn ourselves a man to recall i
think there is a good chance he's sort
of merging hands like ace king and stuff
what was the action i called from the
small blind
okay
i snapped he snapped checked back so
that's good
yeah
or i was going to say you might
sometimes have
sixes wait i have a question for you so
i just had like a royal draw super
strong draw completely fine with a
bad call in the turn the guy is a little
bit over spr one
but i wonder uh if there's any value in
like half potting turn to still jam the
river
and get some fall expertise from maybe a
middle parrots like queen jack six
right you you had the draw
yeah yeah and it's like queen jack six
four queen jack of clubs uh we have ace
king of clubs the guy who is probably
pretty
recreational
uh calls the flop against like what is
it 30
ish
i half bought the turd and he tank falls
but i wonder if we can if there's any
value like if if the guy let's say calls
a jack on the turn to a jam
i wonder if he's folding if i like half
put the turn jam the river you know what
i mean
what about check calling the turn
at spr one well i like 1.2
i mean he can he can he can like with
the low sbr i don't think people on a
very drawing board are very are very
likely to fold middle pair or better
he did take photo he did tank fault so
it could be could be but then i'm like
okay
good point i mean he's going to if you
check we have like the dominating draw
to his draws right
yeah exactly no good point
i'm getting so confused not playing
against sweden after the last time he
said that he watches my stream
you know i perceive him as yeah
a little bit out of the line
recreational type of player
yeah but then again if he knows that i
perceive him that way you know
a little bit of a mind [ __ ] in some
hands like i start to do play hands in
weird ways
and then i kind of
find myself lost afterwards you know
it's like you have that as well when you
play for example versus a friend
yeah you kind of kind of knows
i feel like this is the same situation
the guy knows how i perceive him
like he is he definitely understands
poker because sometimes i think he makes
great plays yeah
yeah i think
as well if i play like the russian cash
pools on gg i'm always talking about how
nobody bluffs but then
i think more so off off-stream i start
playing a little bit more
focused i think and i probably like
don't overfall as much as i would when
i'm like just cruise controlling on
stream and i really do see that people
are actually starting to bluff more and
more against me i think
but like especially but that's where the
leveling starts you know
like
that that's actually what i found really
hard about uh
about streaming
like if if if we say some things like
that you know then
yeah yeah playing with like 15 buy-ins
with this deposit limit it's a bit
stressy because what is it last friday
or something i was streaming
and i think i had like 15 minds on my
account and just went on the worst run
i'm first in the leaderboard and i just
had to quit because like just went broke
like just on the worst run and yeah
it's it's unnecessary you know like it's
unnecessary because it really got to be
like i was so frustrated and like this
is so annoying and like there's no need
for that you know
all right let's uh
let's trap the aces here
let's do it i love this thing in the
chat these two guys just keep
interrupting each other i feel like in
general that's how i conversate
actually
i i remember actually once that
uh we had someone coming over actually
we had gilly coming over at poker vision
was uh when he like a long time ago
um
he came over to talk about like we were
gonna work together
and then uh the other guy was there
he started to note how often i
interrupted him
and afterwards after one half hour or
something i interrupted him
i think it was like
25 times
well to be fair like gili also said it
weren't about like interruptions it was
just like i was getting excited about
the stuff that he was talking about and
i wanted to share my thoughts on that as
well right
but i have that as well with somebody's
telling something or explaining
something i have a question i just i
just ask it instantly
because often i think mainly because i
think it's important for me to follow
the story let's say somebody is like
telling a story
and
for whatever like for context reasons
there's something i want to know because
it like changes how i
i don't know feel about the story let's
say i just like interrupt them and then
like [ __ ] i just interrupted them again
like always
always
but let's see what sweden's gonna do
i see that the ace jack of a jacob club
of clubs
well maybe not today
i'm hoping for yolo come on don't do it
to me again now
quicker that's better see that's why i
called down with green jack
that's a nice stack already there now it
starts to make more sense oh no
yeah exactly and to be fair i i've seen
him
i give the guy respect he plays like
sort of solid but a little bit out of
line or very out of line but for example
i've seen him messing around with the
seven dudes in there as well and then
for example or i don't bluff and he's
he's like chicken song you know in this
case you know trying to get in a pot
with sweden on the turbo pocket eights
in general not a bad idea but there's a
lot of hands if you look at the evf
three betting smaller versus epmp people
just stream at them because they don't
want to have a calling range
did they ban you without warning
somebody asked i guess so
me no no they did warn me
once and what happened then because you
you couldn't play or what was the
warning
the warning was you know you are uh uh
watch out for bomb hunting behavior
i mean i do remember that it's like so
funny it's like yeah man you're playing
too good
that's pretty much what they're saying
almost like
start playing worse or we're gonna ban
you maybe you should have just like
really just punted some stacks here and
there just so you could be able to keep
playing that game
i think it was also i think the quote
quote mistake that i made back then was
uh
that for example if a regular wanted to
play heads up
i had no interest in that
uh but then for example a fish would
join me heads up and i would play
but other than that like 300 plus i was
perfectly fine playing i just didn't
want to play heads up
which you know isn't necessarily dead
weird but also back then you know you
couldn't type so i couldn't say like
okay i only want to play three-handed or
something
that's crazy you couldn't type
right what did sweden do raise the
pockets because i was considering a
little blocky
pay attention guys we are giving away
over 10k dollar worth of free prizes in
our poker ambition academy including a
free license to our mechanics of poker
program
so what are you waiting for join our
weekly interactive webinars at the poker
ambition academy uh listen i'll give you
a little read and recreationals if they
three bet and then check the flop
yeah that's wrapping you man that
trapping you
yeah i think i could go
the run out was very good for me very
good very good
i thought i could get him off of
something
but i thought well
okay
and and yeah these are exactly the spots
that we talked about right if you're
really and this is the thing if your
reads are on you know you you you are
doing great
if your reads are off
yeah sure
i don't know it's a
the flush draw board do you do you
expect recreations to travel over flush
draw boards
i think they're there i think actually
the board doesn't really matter all that
much
to be honest
it's more like if they three bet out of
position than check flop they they can
definitely still be trappy
uh on king jack nine two clubs it seems
to me like queens or jack queen or jack
dinner
but yeah aces credits to him you know oh
wow he didn't race
i think for for a while as well i did
not see myself as a poker player
so
then what did you see yourself as now
i'm curious i don't know i really didn't
know it's like what do i want to do and
like i felt i felt sad for her for a
while like i don't know i just didn't
know like and then
if you don't know or like
it was so hard you know it's like i
don't i wear i gotta get the motivation
from somewhere but i didn't see myself
as a poker player i didn't know if i
wanted to be a poker player uh-huh
yeah it was exactly what we just talked
about right you just woke up and you
didn't have an alternative playing poker
was what you're gonna do right
exactly the same with streaming as well
like again and it's like it's kind of a
negative spiral where i didn't feel good
i streamed the streams weren't that good
like because i was not in the best mood
or like i didn't stream long enough and
like you'll have less viewers and people
stop watching you and like it's a bad
negative especially i think streaming
right because streaming you're trying to
give good energy over to the to the
public but if you don't feel good it's
actually a tough spot we're playing a
bomb pod yeah i see it
i'm just gonna
he's gonna muck it
mark it not lose any money
yeah i know i think like i'm gonna use
an extreme word now but it kind of was i
was kind of torturing myself like at
some point and like it just sucked
although it helped me as well i remember
there were streams because i talked a
lot about like me not feeling mentally
great like it was always nice when i
talked about this openly and people
would like really support me you know be
like man like i like that you talk about
this or like keep your head whatever and
just like be generally nice like that
was good but it also really frustrated
me because
it's not fun you know like it only makes
it worse like
i'm i'm already liking this negative
vibe and then my streams become kind of
negative but i still have to stream i
mean i remember this is already a while
ago but probably four or five months ago
there was a time where i thought like i
really should take a break for like two
months from streaming and in hindsight i
just had an interview with my friend
henry lister as well where i said in
hindsight i should have
like i should have but i didn't like i
mean now it's fine
uh yeah i just i don't know i would
definitely was like my balance will be
like a few days a week where i just like
grind like crazy and then often now
weekends because my girlfriend and my
friends you know they work during the
week it's like in the weekend i'll just
take it back to normal life
exactly exactly i've always find that
important by the way to just live normal
life i've never i've never went to the
grind to the night grind and do
like that it was always just important
to me to to
yeah i would just work nine to five you
know because my wife also worth nine to
five
and you know i might give up some
ev there but you know
yeah life is more important i guess it
depends on the person like your personal
preferences but i really like that but i
think like i never had that and i
probably at some point at least needed
that without realizing it
and i think that's also part of like why
yeah i just
you know i could call it depression i
think partially it's also just a burnout
you know and now it's nice that i just
listen if you put if you put a lot of
hours in especially if you're trying to
force yourself into something that you
don't get energy from so it only costs
you energy and you don't recover enough
then you're gonna get a burnout wow
that's a good point i actually didn't
think about it like that like i didn't
get any energy back really
actually there's uh do you know the it's
a dutch buzzkatz do you know the
psychology of success podcast
no
we definitely recommend checking out
there's an episode there a couple
episodes where they talk about burning
out
energy they're quite good
psychology of success
yeah so i translated that uh please
leave a success so yeah it's dutch
okay okay
um wait i want to say something
yeah i think uh
i think also
what really
[ __ ] me up mentally was
the point where and i don't think i mean
i don't know like
if you say you always used to grind nine
to five and obviously you stream but not
as much as i did like for me that was
like
i grinded much harder you know like it
really became my life which
at the time i loved
and
uh was completely fine that like
streaming and playing poker was my life
for like such a big part but then i got
to this point where
that was not what i wanted anymore like
you know my values changed let's say
like what i wanted changed and
that was hard to just like make that
shift and like i would even say cause
i was making for example friends here in
amsterdam but
it almost was like new to me again to
like
let people in my life or just like do
more outside of poker
have have a life you know like have a
life outside of poker let's say
so that was said that was like a
difficult transition i guess for me i
guess that would be somewhat weird for
anyone because like i was really
my life really was poker
streaming and then like occasionally
i would i don't know you know like go
party with friends or like go on a date
like once every two months or something
but yeah no my life really was streaming
in poker which was fine right because
you really enjoyed it and it gave you a
lot of energy yeah and i also tell
people like those were probably
and i think even when i'm hopefully i
will get that old let's say 80 years old
i'll tell my [ __ ] grandchildren like
man those were some of the best years of
my life because what's better in life
than just like doing day in day out what
you love you know oh seven dudes versus
on that's a bad idea but they've had
some three bets i might don't mind a
little format
it's also old school name
ah too bad
why didn't eat three bet
have you what was the sample that you
had to have for to do seven like a
hundred hands man then in the last hand
so the hundred hand i i gave away the
profit
no yeah
okay i see queen in space
queen nine spades
no i lost the hanta it was ace and off
that's correct is that is it correct
yes it is okay so now we're gonna see
how many people are correct and then
i'll create a new view no we're not
gonna spin the wheel yet i'll create
another wheel what's this there
the people who got it right
i think it was the ten of clubs
spirit of curse
there's a heart attack maybe
oh a lot of people are getting it right
man damn
i thought it was a club
yeah but now they're gonna copy paste it
maybe you should take like the first
five people or something okay first five
yeah i'll take the first five because
otherwise
if i would be in your chat right now
would you just say aston as well
i mean obviously yeah so i have
wait i'm gonna get invited should i
should i say to your channel
let me get in the free roll
don't think that would be allowed
do you do any ten percenting we started
out they were a little ten percent
different defense
all right
i don't do a lot of ten percent thing
25 is well i'm like what is a tree flush
boris i do
monster on board
i guess you'll just have to roll it for
e4 man
so a stan that's it right so there's
these four people then
yeah all right we'll spin between these
four people
let's go
i think it's going to be
proper no it's recording all right he
was the first one as well
ah that's so that's fair and it's funny
because it was first time chat from
