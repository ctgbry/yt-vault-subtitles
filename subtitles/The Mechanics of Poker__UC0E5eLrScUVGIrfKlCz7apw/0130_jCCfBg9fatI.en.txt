looking forward to seeing you in that

guys
how is everyone today
got some games in store
for a little high stakes real session
actually
wanted to complete where we left off

[00:47]
wanted to complete where we left off
the other time but actually i couldn't
find the footage anymore
because i didn't recall anymore what the
footage was
but hey
and this is the footage that we're going
to review
it's um let me see what is this

[01:01]
it's um let me see what is this
the left we have a table of 200 400 and
a right we have a table of 5100 i'm not
mistaken
you got the t dot wider in the mix
we got roman herald we got
mr limited himself here on the left we

[01:15]
mr limited himself here on the left we
got limitless
john mclean
linus and isaac haxen so we have a
star-filled lineup star-filled lineup
the recreational is probably here in my
blue guy from china

[01:31]
blue guy from china
and here it's probably the woody dua
jimoh
usually
guys are from china right another
recreation a little limpy lippy limpy
here on the bottom

[01:46]
and an eyesore from the small blind
a little half-bot c-bet
gets a call from limitless who
[Music]

[02:00]
[Music]
is a good term for uh limitless range
in general it's a similar
poker in general right the similar spot
is the other wrong he could still have
air
basically he's gonna call less with
air
you know where he can see that for

[02:16]
you know where he can see that for
example king jack off
limitless would maybe only call king
jack suited right back doors so indeed
he checks
and we face a little wandered back from

[02:30]
and we face a little wandered back from
limitless which i think your range
definitely wants to do
you indeed fall down and like the king
jack
we get a call so
we can start narrowing down the ranges

[02:45]
we can start narrowing down the ranges
he better the half ball on the flop
freeway
just interesting and then he decides to
check all the turn
say you have [ __ ] aces or something
on the turn you should probably just
start check raising it's way more likely
that then this is gonna have something

[03:00]
that then this is gonna have something
like sixes
three six five is four ten
i don't really think he's going to float
all that often three-way right so i
think we should start check raising aces
so i would say

[03:15]
so i would say
girl girly
most likely just to have a 10.
limitless is going to have two sizings
here in the river a jam
which he probably wants to do with the
flush
and then usually something that looks

[03:31]
and then usually something that looks
like a flush but um
you know it looks like a flush but it's
not a flush
so let's say it did float the ace jack
with his face or something
please figuring it out

[03:46]
please figuring it out
this is by the way a good teller for the
guys who play mistakes look how long
higher six people think about decisions
okay i see a couple guys you know that
they're just playing way too fast way
too fast you cannot make proper

[04:00]
too fast you cannot make proper
decisions at that speed now if here at
high safes they can't then
you can't either
so he indeed figured it out
and he decided that he had a good hand
to jam first i think his range is going

[04:15]
to jam first i think his range is going
to be in quite a tough spot
as he's going to just often have a 10
like i said
i think that kind of sucks because like
i said he better half pot and those
three-way so limitless his floats are

[04:32]
three-way so limitless his floats are
very much reduced
probably going to be
his bluffs are probably going to be
something that
is sort of strong
so [ __ ] of threes maybe an ace two
suited this kind of hands

[04:48]
i think he can block a lot of hands and
it's still not over bluffing
red palette coming in with the raids
thank you very much sir

[05:04]
give it to me baby
give me
what the [ __ ]
give me the break give me the right
thank you

[05:15]
thank you
so yeah i think in general in a spot
like this it's less likely that
limitless given the fact that the
opposite way if this was just blind
versus blind the spot would just play
way way way different but given the fact
that it's three weights i think less

[05:30]
that it's three weights i think less
likely that limitless is over bluffing
so if you have a bluff catcher in the
scenario like this
i think best case scenario um
your vlog catcher is gonna be very even
but a lot of scenarios given the fact
that he can probably bluff anything that

[05:46]
that he can probably bluff anything that
he arrives with on the river that
doesn't have enough shadow value
i uh it's uh
usually a good idea to hold here
waco it sounds like you're using your
pc's mic not the mic in front of you

[06:00]
pc's mic not the mic in front of you
yes it's really interesting
let me
you say that now as well okay should be
good now
so yeah we concluded right i wouldn't do
too much calling unless you think your
opponent is really aggressive and
you know

[06:16]
you know
grabs the 5 6 suited
and goes bombs
and he doesn't realize it's a very tough
spot

[06:30]
he
also with this text eyes you know he
when he checks the turn he's just not
gonna have a lot of strong hands because
he would have just checked race let's
say his way deeper he has way more hands
that he can call with

[06:46]
because he's going to check on more
strong ants on the turn
so it's just going to be a spot where
you're going to end up with a lot of
bluff catchers yeah i know i i've also
never heard the
stories about thinking that he's a

[07:01]
stories about thinking that he's a
is using an rta
here we have an open the recreational
cult
that's right over called the big blind
freeway spots always fun
less solved

[07:17]
but obviously you know there's some uh
these are basic principles here
that apply
recreations in the pot it always gets
even more interesting
oh lioness shows a little three right

[07:30]
oh lioness shows a little three right
here big blind versus
b
get a delayed seabed of around two
thirds of the pot from roman
with a recreational pot he's probably
allowed to bat a little bit bigger as
you were called get called with worse
hands more often

[07:47]
since there's a recreation on the pot
green is interesting i would definitely
implement i actually know
your chopper is any ace so i would
definitely reserve my
my blocks for ace king

[08:02]
but i would usually do
i don't think i will have
much huge bedding unless i have the nuts
a king jack i'll just jam

[08:15]
a king jack i'll just jam
alright
he goes for a check he has an acid that
makes quite a lot of sense i think that
hey that hand is just a mandatory check
and this guy checked back queen nine
this is a very good read to have on
recreationals and you see this quite
often recreations kind of forget

[08:30]
often recreations kind of forget
to value about their hands
making their bedding range
a bit too no i was gonna say a bit too
polarized but no over bluffy in a master
class we take the deepest dive available
out there into one specific spot we will

[08:45]
out there into one specific spot we will
compare all the strategies discuss all
possible lines discuss various textures
talk about gto and how to exploit your
population you're already further down
your career and there's just this one or
two spots that could need some extra

[09:00]
two spots that could need some extra
work the master classes are for you the
master classes are revised and improved
content directly from our cfp program so
what is the spot that you have most
trouble playing in
browse through the masterclass library
and fix those leaks so a big checklist

[09:16]
and fix those leaks so a big checklist
here from limitless it's a good board to
do it on
as
threes and fives are usually not in the
under the guns openers range fives could
be
uh
but the recreational is on the bottom
and he doesn't really have a big stack

[09:31]
and he doesn't really have a big stack
this guy doesn't really have a big stack
so i would say with short stackers here
and the recreational being on the button
i wouldn't open fives
uh he also doesn't open king three
suited he also does the open king five
suited whereas limiters has all these
hands so

[09:45]
hands so
from that perspective
this is the part where you look at your
own range you compare it to how much
strong hands your opponents can have
and from that you can start upping your
aggression right that's
how poco works

[10:00]
how poco works
so the ingredients here i would say
limitless as the green light
it's a very good turn also for limitless
range as it improves the equity with his
bluffs six seven was a gutter and i was
an open ender so i definitely expected
big sizing like 4.5 k or something

[10:16]
big sizing like 4.5 k or something
or just pot
a little bit over pot probably
it's probably gonna be the quote called
correct sizing here
and you should definitely also turn some
some hands into a bluff

[10:30]
so this goes for the 4.3 as expected you
should maybe turn um
like 3 4 or something into a bluff
before suited

[10:45]
i'll mix strategies on flop with ace
a mixed strat flop with ace like a65 ace
9 suited in triba pods
do you recommend going small or big with
your mix strategy

[11:01]
your mix strategy
wait i have to re-read this one in the
mirror by the way we have all import on
the other hand on the other table
but actually we'll go back to that
let me re-read this for you a mixture

[11:15]
let me re-read this for you a mixture
flop with ace like a65
ah so a65 ace 910 suited
so these type of boards yes in trivia
pods do you recommend going small or big

[11:30]
pods do you recommend going small or big
with your mix strategy both in position
and out of position
i mean both in position out position we
cannot really merge the two i would say
actually the nine pairs which is
interesting which counterfeit some of uh
limitless value right five three suited

[11:46]
limitless value right five three suited
king three suited king five suited
also let's say limitless hat
like six seven a hearts or something
you know he's now
it's not really the greatest hand to
be bluffing with so it's a spot that i

[12:01]
be bluffing with so it's a spot that i
think he's gonna do quite some checking
curious actually how much checking he's
we will look this up hand up in a second
but yeah on the ace
10 9 i would definitely implement bigger

[12:15]
10 9 i would definitely implement bigger
sizings on the a65 a little bit less

[12:30]
so you indeed get the five three and got
counterfeited whereas toot wilder
stuck around with the king jack
actually i don't think i mentioned with
five threes also in these one of these
hands that uh

[12:46]
one guy can have in the other can't
ah this seems like a cool game
three-handed lioness limitless and cold
burns
who's call burns guys inform me
empty t-rex and the t-rex uh with a lot
of money

[13:01]
he's feeling it
limitless and line is three-handed
limitless things is booming again
floating the queen three off to bluff
river
that's

[13:15]
that's
next level [ __ ] yeah they were actually
both going to be interesting so three
bats from linus
they're playing 100 200 so yeah it's
fine tune off 12.
definitely a boardride is going to have
a lot of big bats on mr linus going to

[13:32]
a lot of big bats on mr linus going to
be a mix
small by big bet
smaller bed not being the dominant as
the board is two-tone so probably more
czech big bat
carl said i'm stuck for you like
flipping for my stack okay that's uh

[13:48]
flipping for my stack okay that's uh
sure lim just loves that so lioness
indeed went for a checking strategy
he's now going to have a mix
he definitely wants to check raise like
some strong hands on the flop
and then if it goes check check you

[14:00]
and then if it goes check check you
should definitely have a big bet again
on the turn
let's look this hand up from carl
and i can maybe explain better what i'm
saying

[14:17]
actually can we
it was a race
a fold
a call
a fold
no
sorry a squeeze

[14:31]
sorry a squeeze
a fold
a fault
a call
our freight is here of the 368 i don't
think that afraid right it's not not
insanely crazy
50 50 afraid okay it's 50 50 afraid of

[14:46]
50 50 afraid okay it's 50 50 afraid of
the the 368.
that makes sense
like he would be way more afraid of the
365 than we would probably
approach range checking
no okay completely off here

[15:03]
this makes no sense to me why is the 865
the same as the 863
here's us to check a little bit more

[15:16]
here's us to check a little bit more
i mean we are
it mixed in quite nicely here with the
okay so it's because we also improve in
the squeezing range that we're using we
also improve
if you miss the bottom if you miss these
bottom hands

[15:30]
bottom hands
then there's definitely going to be a
difference in terms of board
out the board plate
check
for your space i mean he did do a lot of
checking on the flop he should do a lot

[15:45]
checking on the flop he should do a lot
of betting and now he can start the
laying so whatever his block is going to
be
asus usually checks again these ends are
going to delay so it's going to be a bit
in this broadway region so what i'm
saying is then if you think someone has
already severed the flop with a lot of
these hands

[16:01]
these hands
then yeah on the turn
you don't really have much bets left
yeah he's definitely gonna go for big
bats so the big bat is is fine
hey yeah we're basically [ __ ] us in

[16:15]
hey yeah we're basically [ __ ] us in
position
there's nothing else i can say
wow you should go anywhere

[16:33]
and you should go any better
he's definitely not calling any pair
because he's thinking about it quite
well

[16:46]
and this is a thing where
rationality and your intuition comes up
but like i said it's um
it's an interesting spot
it did actually defaults which should be

[17:00]
it did actually defaults which should be
very unfrequent now if you liked this
