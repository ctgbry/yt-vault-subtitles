they're gonna throw out a two barrel or

board's gonna run out but the two barrel
is
probably guaranteed unless i turn an ace

[05:32]
at the bar yet is probably going to

[05:51]

drops you explain me that why would my
wire drop
but my wi-fi stay connected
we tried a little for bed here against
the
mr under low frequency this one low
frequency low frequency

[08:02]
frequency low frequency
he calls okay okay a little temper stand
there on the flop
uh oh hope he doesn't have aces guys
let's hope he doesn't have ace
but let's start with a little 10 percent

[08:19]
you know what i'll go for another 10
again

[08:32]
no i'm going to go for a 25
this time she should have maybe went a
little bit bigger
and they fall
while on the me will retrieve the 5 6

[08:46]
while on the me will retrieve the 5 6
suited because
as mr gamewinggamer says that's how i
roll
and we're obviously going to call a four
bet but before we call four bet
i am lucky i'm lucky i'm gonna flop
something let's go
feel it hey guys we flopped an open

[09:01]
feel it hey guys we flopped an open
ender it worked
or at least i take an open-ender in a
four-bed pod queen high board
going to do quite a lot of betting as he
will have way more ace queen off etc etc
in his range
he checks which i think is quite
interesting

[09:19]
i already have a good read on what's
going on so
i'll play this passive i hope he has ace
king

[09:30]
you in this kind of spot i'm not really
sure what's going on so then i just
respond by doing a lot of checking so i
will check all my all my queens i will
just basically check anything
i think that is a fine strategy now the
term we're obviously calling
oh and we make a string we have a street

[09:47]
oh and we make a string we have a street
and they think i'm crazy
let's go let's go let's go
let's go oh
he chance yes yes yes yes thank you very

[10:01]
he chance yes yes yes yes thank you very
much
here make a little cold format with the
ace king

[10:17]
that seems like decent fluff
let me see if we get check race we do
have to call it up most probably

[10:32]
have to call it up most probably
i think i'm gonna have some checks here
on the turn aces
on the flop asus maybe we should just
bat call off ace king with the backdoor
and just check ace king off not really

[10:45]
and just check ace king off not really
sure
but we're gonna play this hand like we
have aces we block ajax suited
which is good

[11:41]
hey he's thinking about it for a long
time my brazilian friend

[11:54]
thought about it for a very long time
huh
seems like quite a gto had to throw it

[12:01]
seems like quite a gto had to throw it
in huh
let's do it we played this hand like we
had aces
let's see if he agrees

[12:17]
to be fair i am a little bit concerned
because the small bet you know
it seems to be an induction size where
i think he thinks i would fall for this
with
one pair type holdings but he falls

[12:31]
one pair type holdings but he falls
ha it was not an induction sizing guys
it was not an induction sizing it
happened to not be in the induction
sizing
okay is jack suited oh that's a pretty
flop

[12:46]
flop
run around at jax and he has asus
and we flop a set because that's how we
roll
more equity guy checks here with aids
okay
he's gonna make a little betty

[13:03]
okay he's still betting
hey come on guys come on
i'm lucky i am lucky
god damn it oh the guy check raises me

[13:17]
god damn it oh the guy check raises me
maybe the luck went to the other table
okay okay let's see your turn my friend
hey but actually we could still be ahead
no yeah
shout out to epiphany guys someone

[13:30]
shout out to epiphany guys someone
actually asking for a
would you like to play 50 or 100 zoom if
you like that go over to epiphany's
channel
and this guy is going bananas let's go
in the tank guys

[13:46]
hmm
yeah yeah yeah yeah okay i called
oh no i jinxed it
he doesn't have eight exit clubs check

[14:02]
he doesn't have eight exit clubs check
well then we brought it best hand or
he's trapping me
basically we thought we were trapping
him but he was just trapping us all the
way
that's definitely a possibility

[14:19]
no snap call please actually this guy
could still be timing with aces or kings
he's afraid of the flesh i'm afraid of
the flesh
and people think i have seven dudes in

[14:31]
and people think i have seven dudes in
this end because i don't know what's
going on here
two and a half seven and a half 20 36
he's still doing this with ace king

[14:51]
should probably call
but am i like pop is not an ace or a
king
i'm probably still [ __ ] i've just i
don't i don't know man i'm just gonna

[15:00]
don't i don't know man i'm just gonna
get out of the way
you win
this is like self protection could not
go broke on the low board

[15:34]
interesting river

[15:51]
wow that's it that was no
this head

[16:01]
this hand
i think he can still have a 10

[16:16]
that's [ __ ] sixes shout out to
man i like it i like it
you know you know i follow nick's advice
that's gonna open myself up to this

[16:30]
that's gonna open myself up to this
you know i follow nick's advice in this
hand you know and because i'm operating
the assumption that he's very polarized
in that spot which
combinatorically narrows his value range
of taunton
um could create a bluffing imbalance if
he's not very careful
now it's like that yeah seems quite

[16:47]
now it's like that yeah seems quite
clear right guys
combatarically speaking the polarization
of
the realization of the
triple range merge on this river
makes my blockers i i don't know

[17:03]
makes my blockers i i don't know
but you know assumption that he's very
polarized in that spot which
combinatorically narrows his value range
of taunt and um
could create a bluffing imbalance if
he's not very careful

[17:15]
he's not very careful
no it's like that yeah it seems quite
clear right guys
combatarically speaking the polarization
of
the realization of the
triple range merge on this river

[17:30]
triple range merge on this river
makes my blockers i i don't know
but you know clip because we're flopping
sets again
almost a set here

[17:48]
and this hand probably just gonna be
betting right

[18:12]
um

[18:35]
snap folsom he probably had a draw ace
king
mr soviet wings man this guy

[18:46]
mr soviet wings man this guy
what's your problem

[19:05]
snap why do you keep snapping my friend
oh no diamonds we needed diamond
no okay good good good actually in the

[19:17]
no okay good good good actually in the
chat also said like gto
solver really likes his call down
actually i agree basically we triple
downy at a6
when i go triple i basically say i have
king queen or better
and ace king and aces are a big part of

[19:30]
and ace king and aces are a big part of
that range so when you have an ace
uh yeah when you have ace that's a great
hand to call down for example it's way
better than hand like pocket pants
pocket knives
pocket horse pocket freeze which is
gonna have a certain amount of
time six or maybe straight

[19:48]
i'm gonna give this one to charlie
carroll the positive vibes where i am
lucky definitely
definitely made me make a river
definitely made me hit the straight

[20:03]
yeah that's about it i had a lot of fun
i think we played okay
a couple of hands that were a little bit
misplayed
well now do some analyzing first and

[20:16]
well now do some analyzing first and
then i'm actually gonna hit the gym
