i'll randomize flapping yourself here
hop up randomize flopping a circle
you're randomizing i i randomized the
perfect moment
[Music]
got a little announcement for you guys
because next to our mechanics of poker
program and masterclasses we have now
released the poker ambition academy in
this academy you will be receiving
weekly interactive webinars based on
your pain points we will be discussing
all areas that you can improve him to
become a more successful poker player
taught by coaches who have walked the
path that you are currently walking so
if you're interested go over to the site
and looking forward to seeing you in the
academy i think it's
less common
so
what is your number oh 16 okay
it was it was very low
so but this is actually a spot where i
think
um
i prefer to feel like
[ __ ] threes over like pocket sevens
absolutely because you you have better
unblockers
exactly
yeah so i think the
threes is the fine view
and i think this is a spot where we
basically don't have any vlogs
unless we have [ __ ] threes like we
have now how do we always find ourselves
in this situation
um
i'll go to bluff it and
it is fine sizing
to basically put pressure on anything
that's not a queen
yeah and at that point you do want to
unblock the birds because these balls
are gonna come from two pairs sometimes
right so
yeah so this is i think a spot where
people don't under understand that
concept they will end up with two little
blocks on that river
and i think in general my bluff there
basically if he doesn't have a queen i
think he's just gonna fold i wasn't down
between like three quarters and pot i
think with three quarters people still
will call their absolute strong hand
let's say he has a set or two pairs like
[Music]
cry
it will need to go probably it will need
to mix some sets in for sure but yeah
it can call just a queen but yeah
unless you don't have any black but you
will have blocks because you're a good
player so you build your you know
talk properly you know with it you can
have something
i knew it was going to be her was on i
gave a spoiler i said we're going to
have a female gaston
i think i think we eliminated quite a
lot of possibilities
so
yeah
do you have any uh uh
female poker friends that you
that you talk strategy with
um
i have one friend uh she used to play
live with me um
so like 5 10 10 25 high stakes whatever
for live and
or mean steaks i don't know how you want
to call them and and then she was
playing party poker at the beginning of
the pandemic so we were kinda she was
playing there like uh 2 5 and 5 10.
but then now she stopped for a while
because she's actually becoming a pilot
so i haven't okay interesting career
shift
yeah yeah randomly she decided she
wanted to be a pilot so she
you know she started the school very
intense school so she she hasn't been
playing any poker in the past few months
so i haven't been talk to her about
strategy at all recently but before yeah
she was the one that i could talk to and
it's good to have a girl as well because
like uh i mean even though obviously
there is no difference in terms of like
ability when it comes to play the game
there is some difference when it comes
to emotional level
how do we react to things right
interesting
okay and do do you think that that is
beneficial or a responsible downside
i have no idea if it's better or not
because like i haven't experienced the
other way you know i'm not um
that makes complete sense yeah but but i
guess most popular content on for
example mental game is aimed towards the
male
poker population so
do you associate a lot with that
i experience different types of struggle
so i can tell you something that i think
it could be good for girls compared to
men is that we are less egotistical for
example
so you know how men
like maybe this is sexist actually i'm
saying i'm making a best statement i
don't know but like uh i i've seen in
most of my
of the
guys that play program that i talk to
that maybe they have this sort of thing
that they
want to prove that they're the best or
they need to like you know put
themselves in situations when like um
you know like challenges or like um
heads-up
spots you know
they're more
yeah more egotistical though like they
have to prove that they're the best they
need they have this like big ego
thing
i i don't have that i don't you know
what i mean
yeah in general i think it's also
statistically right as men we die
younger because we just do stupid things
to show off
yeah okay yeah exactly it's more yeah
okay and this is the thing right
everyone strives to play gto as close as
possible but basically what you're
trying to look out for is who who does
the best job
yeah
well and then i mean
whatever i mean i also think that
deviating is good though like you know
what i mean once you for sure
actually i have no
reason to deviate there to be honest
yeah you said that you haven't played
that much with them so you would not
have any good no yeah
permission
yeah queen high is good
nice on the other table what
shouldn't be very often there right yeah
so
and this is a pretty decent scenario
against the regression
i guess we're gonna ah this is not great
yeah it's gonna freeze the action
unfortunately but
let's see if we can use him or
get him to go no yeah yeah yeah we have
a little clip for that huh where is it
wow
don't hate me eight eight nine
don't you just hate
the six nine
she plays the 200 zoom pool no what can
the others do
she's beautiful and clever
and what can we ever do to endeavor you
ah i know
look up the 200 zoom pool
thanks for the raid don't hate me 89
and long live
the six nine
what a legend
does he like to write poems in his free
time
i guess it's a poet you know like he has
so many talents
basically for example i see i see rags
in a couple of sort of boxes
right that helps me understand how they
approach poker so and that prevents me
that helps me not project to one
okay that's good
yeah but but see that's what then going
back to that that's why deviation is
kind of like is the best way to maximize
your profit in the end but it's also
dangerous
if you're not
on point
especially especially right if you get
more knowledge on how the brain works
it's a
bit scary
is that exactly that's why
yeah like we were talking about like the
thinking fastest load right and shows
you how our perceptions are pretty much
not reliable
uh at all
true
true but as you said like you are
actually just describing like the
process of hand reading right you're
trying to figure out
if this is the over blocker on the spot
based on the amount of natural hands you
should show up with in that spot
yeah exactly
i think that like it will work quite
often like understanding if people can
you know what i mean because
you can see clear tendencies of people
not finding enough bluffs in certain
spots because they feel uncomfortable
they have to make uncomfortable
either
bats or calls
sorry i let you play
okay
very interesting one
yeah with just photos like
it's not your hand is just literally
unblockers it doesn't really block any
values just from blockers i've got the
set and uh straight
yeah but
ah yeah through a kind of straight seven
five sixes i mean yeah
people three basics is probably blind
super low frequency maybe nine maybe but
it's weird because the eighth count of
its love is value like jack six suited
back four suit
true
which is good as is most likely to give
up space
so yeah it's it's a reasonable bluff
catcher i would say
yeah i mean yeah
true
if he has a more
um
that kind of tormenting range which you
could have because that would be the
gto to betting range i feel sometimes
people being
is less diversified like it should be
uh for sure i would say that's uh that's
uh that's a that's a very solid in a
master class we take the deepest dive
available out there into one specific
spot we will compare all the strategies
discuss all possible lines discuss
various textures talk about gto and how
to exploit your population if you're
already further down your career and
there's just this one or two spots that
could need some extra work the master
classes are for you the master classes
are revised and improved content
directly from our cfp program so what is
the spot that you have most trouble
playing in browse through the
masterclass library and fix those leaks
like i have a couple of jokes in my main
coaching program in the mechanics
okay
i i just can't tell myself
i mean that's your personality that's
fine exactly yeah i think it also else
it gets a bit boring to watch
okay now for the next 18 hours i'm gonna
talk a lot of interesting stuff about
poker yeah very monotone uh
yeah yeah i try i like to put some
excitement in it basically right
i think it's good i think that's
i mean i'm sure you got a lot of good
feedbacks about your mechanics at poker
so yeah for sure
i'm uh very actually i'm gonna
the beginning of the year probably a
little update
because yeah
if i can speak 18 hours about small
first big blind i can probably speak 200
hours about poker in general right
oh yeah it's infinite you know material
you can create that's for sure
i mean the more you study program the
more you see how complex it is and how
many things you know there are to know
to analyze or and also in terms of you
know your own learning curve right you
always when you reflect
i always know more now than i knew six
months ago or
you know i heard someone explain
something in a certain way i'm like ah
that actually makes way more sense so
explain it that way
i'll randomize flapping yourself here
hop up randomize flopping
good randomizing i randomized the
perfect moment
you have to teach me this trick
not easy i am well i imagine
see this is the trick why they say that
you are both they already looked into
your account
people do say i run very good with
flopping sets i check the data it's just
normal only i obviously highlight
highlighted very very much right
of course i'm actually surprised that
you felt the need to go and check the
data
now of course i was like do i really
flop somewhere set
i checked the data on the text it's not
so
bad sure you're like you're just
humiliated you're like just like
everybody else
yes
unfortunately i wish i had that
superpower right i was like hey maybe i
know something that they don't
i mean you could definitely like sew
that for a lot of money by the way if
you knew that trick
yeah you know
first about like how to flap sets
that's
is that your bigger size on the river
um
you have a shove or do you think um
let's say the river was up too maybe
would you shove your hand
i mean i have to say shoves in this spot
obviously
uh
a shove in this spot
i'm not
that really sure about
now
yeah actually i think we're not in a
great scenario here
gonna make arguments wait
because i did consider for a while to
just stream 200 because the list is more
relaxing for example for me
i mean now that 500 zoom run especially
if we're talking it's easier for me also
i also have to
manage lobbies getting tables et cetera
et cetera so i would need to it's
another part of my attention that would
go somewhere else right
yeah so yeah 500 zoom is a good format
because it's fast entertaining and for
you is also lower state so maybe yeah
yes
whatever is more like
even if you're not performing your best
you're still probably gonna crush these
games anyway so who cares i mean
crash crisis is a big word i mean we're
definitely facing the opposition
do well
i would pick
uh
someone here focus only on the zoom
tables and playing his a-game over me
bunking around in the twitch streams
probably
depends who of course you know you have
exactly depends who different level of
uh
of players
do you feel you're getting better though
multitasking with time or do you feel
yeah yeah for sure
yeah
for sure
because i thought i'm getting better i
used to sit out a lot and i was really
painful
now at least i don't do that anymore i'm
still
[Music]
not playing my best but
i miss my someone misses the techno
music okay sorry
when is the seven dudes big game but
we need to uh probably direct punter is
actually in for a seven deuce challenge
okay someone jams on us again
why do people keep on jamming on us
today
what the [ __ ]
as the wreck punter would say
what the
[ __ ] they wanna put you in tough spots
what the full crack punter chicken sound
for the wacko let's go
[Music]
do you actually play every seven two
hand you get doubts though no i i did it
for a while when i was doing the
challenge
and that's how i was thinking maybe
wreck punter is up for the chance we do
another seven dudes challenge play every
seven dudes who makes the most profit at
the end of under hands wins
okay
i tried to find the if you're interested
i tried to find people to do it that
nobody wanted
i'm good i'm good isn't you know maybe
in the future i don't know the winner
the winner would get the dolce gabbana
piana the same old limitless uh hat
oh that's a really nice one actually
yeah 700 bucks expensive stuff
yeah now you're tempting me because uh
now that i know that that's the
rewards i mean i'm sure they also have a
female version so
but so wait the reward but we have to
get this straight if i win you give me
the dolce gabbana
if you win i give you the deutsche bank
so yeah that's kind of how it works
but ain't nobody took my off on my up up
on my bed but i'm sure wreck founder
would be it
i saw james bye ginge also refused me
everyone refused me
wow
weird that why would they refuse the
seven juice bath
i don't get it actually to be fair i
almost profited the last hand we lost
her profit
i think you should actually i don't know
if you already tried because i think he
would accept it charlie charlie will
accept something like that i think
yeah maybe
seems the kind of guy that like you know
he can actually make money with someone
too because he just needs to believe
you know
about how you please
is it this time again are they gonna rip
it in again wrap that straight
all this good reversal 75
why this jam it in
yeah i don't know this is such a weird
i wish he would have just jammed it in
i'm way happier versus jammed versus
this
where he has yeah what can i do with
probably just a bad bluff
love that wants to hold my blood so like
five six probably doesn't really want to
jam or like a flushed bra
but then again
leave a void but this actually maybe
would be very bad king jam
