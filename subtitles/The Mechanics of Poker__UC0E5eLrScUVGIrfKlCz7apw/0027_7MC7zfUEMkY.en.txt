[00:00]
yeah i feel like i should probably just
call this again uh but i'm very not
happy about it
but then again if we're good we can play
a clip
this is definitely a step going theory
but i don't feel like in practice
i'm very happy here

[00:24]
which i said i actually have to look
this one up
i marked it last week now it was this

[00:30]
i marked it last week now it was this
week
it was the queen six yeah it was this
one
for the people don't remember it was an
open raised mim raise a defend queen six
suited we flop

[00:45]
suited we flop
very nice he bets half pot i
check race he calls and the turn is a
five
and there were various i actually also i
asked the people like hey
what would you do here i decided to go

[01:02]
what would you do here i decided to go
for a check i think the block
was something that was mentioned quite
often i think that's the
quote quote easy play um
or at least like the most the play that

[01:16]
or at least like the most the play that
makes makes it easiest for you to play
the hand you will get in the last
trouble but i don't think it's the
optimal play this is
it's it's a hard it's hard to really say
what's what's best here i decided to go
for a check i had some reasons which

[01:31]
for a check i had some reasons which
i went to the solver and basically the
conclusion was guys
i checked the river but the river light
doesn't exist okay
we came into a tree that both players
don't
do anything because basically after
checking he bets
i should not actually already fold my

[01:46]
i should not actually already fold my
hand on a turn actually i do very little
to no betting
and i will check all set in a low flush
i think definitely i will do a lot of
checking on this turn as a lot of my
check raise range didn't really improve

[02:00]
check raise range didn't really improve
my top pair is really worth much
even a flush still has to dutch a
diamond has to dodge a padded board
because the positions are quite tight
uh and a set of two pack cannot really
bad for value to streets as it will only
get caught by a flush
so it's a spot where we should play very

[02:15]
so it's a spot where we should play very
passive
so i should actually already check
folder on the turn i should mainly do
check calling him with flushes
and sets but i did check call
a river pass the board check and i
basically i'm i'm in a line that doesn't

[02:30]
basically i'm i'm in a line that doesn't
exist with
with my head and actually surprisingly
he has to check back like 90
of his range or something he is even
checking back nut flushes when the board
pass as my range
uh basically contains a flush or a set

[02:45]
uh basically contains a flush or a set
most of the time on the turn so i
misplayed his hand
completely you have jammed did not flush
um which in the solver is sometimes a
check but hey i check out the queen six
on the third so i definitely shouldn't
be checking and i even call it on the

[03:00]
be checking and i even call it on the
river so he should definitely not be
checking so good exploit here of mr
youssef
i think the biggest mistakes that i made
when i looked at the turn range i
thought hands like a standard clubs king
jacket clubs ace king with a diamond etc
would all still be in there

[03:15]
would all still be in there
which in a solver it wasn't then
obviously on the turn he doesn't really
have any bluffs
so yeah then when he bets you should get
the hell out of there and when he checks
you have
usually have the best hand so that's
kind of how it works in this spot
after yousef in a world where i do make

[03:31]
after yousef in a world where i do make
a correct fault it's just very hard to
get called by worse
uh i mean basically i time banked my
whole timing with
pretty strong hand if i have a set
obviously i call felt low flush to be
fair i will also just call
so i think checking back and not flush

[03:45]
so i think checking back and not flush
here is not a great idea
i think the main thing that i
underestimated because if i played his
hand
big blind versus button it's played
correct from both sides or at least in
theory
i just underestimated positions and the
amount of bluffs
that were available so i actually

[04:00]
that were available so i actually
thought that was quite interesting
an interesting hand do you play on gg
currently no but currently i'm not
already playing anywhere
i'm playing here on pokestars with you
guys

[04:19]
okay bingo let's go bingo
i got two pair top two pair even

[04:30]
okay cause
now we have to dutch a nine a ten an
eight
a spade
quite a lot of cards okay okay i'll go

[04:45]
quite a lot of cards okay okay i'll go
check it checking

[05:00]
he rivered the nace unlucky mate
unlucky coffee or tea hey
let's go guys got the seven deuce
don't you know seventies we got the

[05:15]
don't you know seventies we got the
seven dudes
don't you know seven deuce we got the
seven dudes
i just showed them drunken stuff guys
show them drunken style
like bring some fun enjoyment oh [ __ ]
make all this commotion for getting

[05:32]
make all this commotion for getting
[Laughter]
squeezed

[05:52]
i'm actually playing two interesting
hands i was very quiet that's because i
was playing
this hand and this hand which are both

[06:04]
interesting
i won the other one spoiler
we're actually going to win this one as

[06:18]
well
are we yes we are
that oh
[Music]

[06:31]
[Music]
no we didn't just for the fans huh
don't try this at home
i overcalled i went for the 44 to 5
yes 5 bets once or twice

[06:47]
chips encrypts calls turn is not the
greatest of hands
but i decided that it's worth still
investing a little a little bit
basically i'm kind of making my own

[07:01]
basically i'm kind of making my own
price here
he calls river past the board is quite
interesting because on the turn
i think he should probably raise some
jacks
is 10 or something is is likely i would

[07:15]
is 10 or something is is likely i would
say a stand suit that is ninth suited
um but in the same time maybe still i
had like king queen
king 10 suited not i'm actually not
really sure what the
what he's having here

[07:30]
what he's having here
so usually when i'm not really sure of
the range i find it hard to come up with
the correct bad sizing i went for
pots which it's a bit
weird right now right i'm i'm
i'm a little bit lost here what is the
correct bad sizing how do you call me

[07:46]
correct bad sizing how do you call me
with a jack i think ace jack
the nuts should probably raise the turn
but then again a spade
and a board pair quite bad so i do
understand
um his call dutch king leger so you mean
yeah yeah for example you say you have

[08:00]
yeah yeah for example you say you have
25 buy-ins bank rule
and then you take a three bin shot that
that would work for me yeah
obviously if if you're beating your
current game

[08:15]
current game
and if you have a good win right there
not if you're winning at one bb
then try to first win at a certain stake
for example
try to win a dc couple bb then you've
completed
i've already told this you should see
poker as a gay man gamification of poker

[08:33]
poker as a gay man gamification of poker
you play a video game yeah if you're
done at some level you're not gonna
repeat it over and over again right so
as soon as you've beaten the level
don't grind anything lower than the 500
now in my opinion

[08:47]
anything lower than 500 no everything
should be done
in order to get there because from 500
onwards grinding
actually becomes quite interesting
financially
all right i don't think we can value but

[09:02]
all right i don't think we can value but
this queen
he decided not to bluff the bottom of
his range
let's go for the check meme race

[09:19]
interesting turn
very interesting turn
not really sure what to do here i think

[09:30]
not really sure what to do here i think
check folding is probably best
unless he bets very small
it's strange i'll mark that one

[09:46]
can also be that we just have to jam the
turn
but the thing is i don't think i don't
think
an ace high hand is going to fold the
turn when there's two flashlights out
there
even though it probably shoots some of

[10:00]
even though it probably shoots some of
the time at least
but hey that's why we got that's why we
got the zoom chat guys should i have
just jammed the zoom chat
that's why i got the chat that's why we
got the chat in the comments guys
what would you have done here on the
turn would would we just jam it in and

[10:16]
turn would would we just jam it in and
pray pray pray he doesn't have an over
pair and we're drawing to
do a diamond or should we just proceed
carefully
as we're sometimes even dead are we
sometimes that
are you moving to keep playing if

[10:30]
are you moving to keep playing if
in this case the dutch people cannot
anymore play online poker
for a little while or do you find a way
to keep playing ally poker from the
netherlands
i don't think i should be giving some
illegal advice here the

[10:45]
illegal advice here the
actually i like that sizing that i had
what was that hello
okay [ __ ] it then one black one blind is
also fine
and we make what do we make we actually
make nothing

[11:00]
make nothing
just gonna bet one blind again
yeah one blinds my friend he has a nine
and we flop a set versus chips flopping
set versus chips guys that's how we roll

[11:20]
not gonna do any raising on this board
and chopsy goes for the
bed
that was a level good game here

[11:35]
here it's actually a little bit harder
what can i do here
i mean if i have a jack it's quite
unlikely that he is a jack right

[11:46]
well not really the best run out in the
world a king a king of three or three
did he learn hey ace high okay he was
considering a bluff there it is hi

[12:01]
considering a bluff there it is hi
mrs soviet wings joins the pool that guy
man
that guy is after me somehow
i'm always getting imputs against him

[12:15]
i'm always getting imputs against him
and he always owns me
it's personal now
netherlands versus russia
in which area would would would

[12:31]
in which area would would would
netherlands actually win
almost never probably right
in which area would holland win of
russia
online poker online poker let's go for
that online poker interesting flop

[12:59]
that's 18 interesting it's quite small

[13:03]
that's 18 interesting it's quite small
or a low board i should probably be
folding
close to zero percent unless he does it
exploitatively with aces then i'm just
investing money in a pot that i'm going
to lose

[13:31]
i think betting is fine to get him off
ace king as well
i don't mind that i don't expect a lot
of check gems would be a little bit
weird spot in my opinion to check gem

[13:45]
because okay
what does he see that check call river
is so good huh

[14:00]
i do feel like i have to bluff this hand
but i'm not too thrilled about it
aces
i feel like as a queen like queen jack
suited king queen suited

[14:17]
suited king queen suited
it's very hard for me to have a lot of
bluffs here man come on
do recognize that i would have to be
betting tents with a heart on the turn
ah good boy good boy
good boy who the [ __ ] is that guy

[14:35]
who the [ __ ] is that guy huh do you
sports bad wacko actually i just saw
that out of my last chest
i got 10 sports betting on pokerstars
they're trying to suck me in the poke in

[14:45]
they're trying to suck me in the poke in
in the sports betting world no i don't
sports bad
i don't do any gambling for that matter
i'm a very
i'm actually i actually don't really
like gambling to be honest
man no twitching and grinding okay but
probably just in a big pot you take a

[15:00]
probably just in a big pot you take a
look
that i do support
well boy this hand actually should still
peel
some of the time quite tough guys to
defend in these spots i think this hand

[15:16]
defend in these spots i think this hand
should still pew some of the time
let's just do that he checks should not
probably
bluff my hand even though i'm not very
excited about it

[15:32]
but hey gypsy does the snap pop snap
check full shout out to all the static
bots on fire the nail zoom

[15:59]
make a little check right here with jax

[16:01]
make a little check right here with jax
for example actually i think queens here
i prefer calling more tenses laughing
jax is like the sweet spot in raising
in my opinion could obviously be wrong
but
in my opinion
okay okay a little three event here

[16:19]
do not upset the real i will just make a
little call

[16:36]
little call
actually i don't really mind my hand as
a check race
but i do have to be very curious now
what the real makes of this

[16:50]
what the real makes of this
check race flop bad turn

[17:07]
that is a good card guys

[17:18]
that is a good card guys
that's actually not a great river to be
honest
i'll show we do with 7a down

[17:34]
he's probably still very betting all his
other hands
no why did i do that

[17:47]
no why did i do that
oh i'm so bad
i'm so bad why do i sometimes do that oh
oh okay i don't deserve i don't deserve
to win that pot oh i'm such an idiot

[18:02]
to win that pot oh i'm such an idiot
i really upset with myself for that oh
why do i do that this hand
yeah i made them i made the mistake in
thinking that basically all hands that
would
call a bet would jam themselves

[18:15]
call a bet would jam themselves
obviously not all for example if he has
had like 10 jack suited king 10 suited
um jacks i guess
these would be hands that would be
checking behind but i figured if he had
maybe a flush draw
ace king ajax suited me if he has ace

[18:31]
ace king ajax suited me if he has ace
queen plus he's just jamming it himself
you're all i need
to get high oh bucket aces
people when i get some enthusiastic it's
way more likely
actually that i have seven dudes i don't

[18:46]
actually that i have seven dudes i don't
get so enthusiastic anymore about aces
seven dudes i get very enthusiastic for
them

[19:08]
come on mr howe put some money in the
pub mr howe
mr howe mr howe

[19:18]
mr howe mr howe
shall we check race i'm gonna call

[19:32]
getting a little bit of uh interesting
territory
it's probably actually a check race the
thing i have the 80 clubs
which usually leads me to check
somewhere i play the hand passively but
probably it's just a check raise on the
turn with asus exactly

[19:46]
turn with asus exactly
do you realize though that that aces and
like i said it's played
way different in oh my god
what a turn like it plays way different
in

[20:00]
practice than in theory in my opinion so
now what we do huh we have quite a good
hand
good hand big bet that's usually my
philosophy let me see let me think about
this one
yeah we can go good hand big bad here
i'm fan

[20:15]
i'm fan
with exactly king
four this guy's curious
how big shall we go

[20:32]
big bad good hand that's my strategy
he knows that that's my strategy
so a little three bet here the jack 9

[20:45]
so a little three bet here the jack 9
not a great board
[Music]
not very happy about this guys

[21:00]
not very happy about this guys
not very happy about this basically he's
saying
he has a set
even though it's very unlikely as i have
a 9. the jack in general is not a very
good card

[21:16]
good card
ah it kind of blocks someone's blast
maybe jack 10. actually a 10 would
probably be a worse card
assuming he doesn't have
i feel like i should probably just call

[21:30]
i feel like i should probably just call
this again uh but i'm very not happy
about it
but then again if we're good we can play
a clip
[Laughter]
oh this is definitely a step going

[21:45]
oh this is definitely a step going
theory but i don't feel like in practice
i'm very happy here
i did have the pocket dancer

[22:05]
oh my god
that's a good turn that's a good turn
that is a good turn i'm telling you bro

[22:17]
that is a good turn i'm telling you bro
that's a good turn
hey we got a subscriber flowmaster 65

[22:30]
hey we got a subscriber flowmaster 65
shout out to slow motion 65
king river that's a bad river guys
that's a bad river
ah that's a bad river in terms of trying
to get call
as basically my bluffs would come from
king queen king jack which are now very
unlikely

[22:51]
yeah obviously it's not falling oh god
damn it i wasn't paying attention we got
the seven deuce actually i'm gonna slow
play the seven deuce
what do you think of that they don't see
this coming guys they don't see this

[23:01]
this coming guys they don't see this
coming because they think i always play
aggressive with the seven dudes but
my game is all about mixing it up
i'm gonna bet one big blind on the flop
i am mixing it up completely

[23:16]
i am mixing it up completely
they have no [ __ ] clue what's going
on
neither do i i'm i'm in the camp of if
i don't even know what i have and how do
you know what i have

[23:31]
you know what i have
that's the camp i'm in oh
and we got him guys
don't you think about it yes
i wish i wish i was just dealt 70 suited

[23:45]
i wish i wish i was just dealt 70 suited
all the time
no is netherlands yes that is indeed
correct mr big steeler
face a little turnover but

[24:04]
face a little turnover but
i'm still tagging along in these
positions with ace-10 that's
an interesting river that's what they
call
a rio river

[24:16]
and i'm not talking about the pretty
ones as in rio de janeiro coconuts
everything it checks okay that's good
it's good it's good
that's good that's good that's good

[24:48]
although i bet on the river guys
sevens deuces
10x spades seven excess spades
jack queen probably not this hand

[25:03]
jack queen probably not this hand
okay okay thank you sir hey chapsy
let's go chop c set
i am lucky

[25:16]
very bad board actually also remove that
set no no more nine turns
that's actually still already actually
that's already quite a

[25:30]
that's already quite a
big bad thirty four ninths
i would much rather have sixes
what do i do here with nines

[25:45]
call but
not really sure what to do here with
nines

[26:00]
like i said i would much rather have
sixes
it's over guys it's over guys it's nice
to pee on the flop
let me know

[26:41]
oh my god seriously
yeah i know i have nine high which is

[26:46]
yeah i know i have nine high which is
not worth much solver guys software guys
let me know if nice is a call on the
flop
that flow has come to an end when you
realize that it has three hours
that three hours have been passed that's
the moment that you're out of flow so
that sounds the moment i'm gonna go sit
out

[27:02]
and take our losses most probably
[Music]

[27:17]
yeah we didn't win a single bit but
the biggest spot we were almost 50 bb
that's because no one called our value
bets
