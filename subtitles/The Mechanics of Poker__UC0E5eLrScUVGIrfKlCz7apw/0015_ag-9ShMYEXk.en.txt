[00:01]
[Music]
yes yes yes yeah
what a nice song guys what a nice song

[00:15]
what a nice song guys what a nice song
to
introduce the stream damn
damn we started it off good one of the
songs that i added to my playlist
you actually want to follow my playlist
wacko time on spotify

[00:32]
wacko time on spotify
i am feeling good i'm actually quite
excited to play as well
and uh as always have my intention with
me right
we want to approach the poker with a
certain

[00:45]
certain
this poker session with a certain
curiosity we want to be playful
we want to be interested
we want to enjoy
tough opponents putting in us in tough
spots

[01:00]
but most of all we just want to be very
interested okay
and we have some top pair action oh wait
i don't have top pair we have some good
high card action going on there
bricky t here calling in the small
blinds i'm gonna

[01:15]
blinds i'm gonna
check
actually not a bad spot to barrel with
my exact hands
i'm just gonna do that

[01:39]
and i think on the river 910 does get
there i think i have a
check with this hand expect to win

[01:47]
check with this hand expect to win
some of the time against for example
queen 10
here i went for the half pot delay with
my flush draw both players called

[02:02]
ah i am done man
the guy got one time on this king five
actually could
sometimes three bet that started off i
would
stay in the team of you know in the

[02:15]
stay in the team of you know in the
beginning you should show the guys who's
boss
and here we limped in with the tam four
it's not the most horrible 3 but king 5
suited even though we didn't have
interesting flop

[02:30]
don't want to get check raised i'll go
for the chucky checky
he checks again now i think i'm gonna go
for a block

[02:48]
do i
yes actually i think that's okay don't
expect to get a lot of delayed check
raises here

[03:00]
usually but then again yourself is a
crazy crazy guy man
inching river i do feel sort of
obligated now i think to jam

[03:29]
hey now we're sweating guys don't bluff

[03:32]
hey now we're sweating guys don't bluff
euros off
that's usually a good idea but i don't
see
any other way oh
he's die big
i hope he didn't he's not on the vodka

[03:45]
i hope he didn't he's not on the vodka
mystery yourself come on man
just make a let's come to the logical
conclusion that
a check back ace king i was just
wheeling you in
check back ace on the flop i had the
king queen

[04:02]
is really going to hero call me what did
you have ace queen he's thinking it's a
good call
blocking man he's making a sweat
seriously yourself what are you doing
man

[04:18]
50 seconds sweat no he goes king nine
uh wow if you had to think about it for

[04:30]
uh wow if you had to think about it for
that long it's probably a good bluff
right
and then again also like if he has ace
but would he call
because i actually thought he was
thinking with ace queen
how do you guys rate how do we rate

[04:45]
how do you guys rate how do we rate
duracell's call there
it makes our sense right he blocks
for what it's worth
he blocks ninth

[05:00]
he blocks ninth
nine ten suited he blocked
i wouldn't bluff ace king so i think he
has a reasonable bluff catcher but as
you can also see he tanked for so long
it's it's not really a spot where it's a
spot where it's quite hard to find a lot

[05:15]
spot where it's quite hard to find a lot
of
natural blast from me i guess i would
say keeper
i'm going to three bed though
as a run quite a high number but i will
probably call this at by the high
frequency

[05:32]
but on the 1999 oh we got a little 10
percent
love it for the fans in the stream
they like to see those 10 so i'm giving
them
you know sometimes you just have to give

[05:46]
you know sometimes you just have to give
what people want you know
how big should i go on the turn

[06:01]
i'm gonna go for the 25 in the turn and
then we're slowly
increasing
and then for the 30 so we went 10 25
should we go 35 35 is fine that sounds

[06:16]
should we go 35 35 is fine that sounds
like a nice increase
we went 10 25 35 slowly increasing those
sizes

[06:32]
and he goes down ha
[ __ ] a tents with a club

[06:45]
don't actually like that hand as
a call that much but
ah always this [ __ ] [ __ ] that i

[07:02]
ah always this [ __ ] [ __ ] that i
they sent to my email blah blah blah
why can't i just log in go to mr
gazibi's channel say hey mr gazibi
how would you like a nice dolce gabbana
piano don't you

[07:23]
and accept my challenge

[07:42]
dog

[07:45]
dog
let's go for a mini bet one big plane
okay okay okay guess he gets he is in

[08:00]
okay okay okay guess he gets he is in
the check race
oh we have an easy call
and we have easy car again uh oh no oh
this hand where's his hand going guys
where's his hand going i can already see
it going all the way

[08:17]
will you play king queen this way i mean
we definitely have a call on the turn
the river it's gonna be interesting how
tinny goes in terms of which hands we
want to be calling with

[08:32]
oh now he's definitely going to go pins
and i would definitely prefer to have a
queen
king queen ace king
we have quite some good hands here

[08:57]
pot it really feels like king queen

[09:01]
pot it really feels like king queen
really feels like king queen
who's that king queen

[09:17]
but king eight in general such a okay
hand to call it huh
but he wouldn't be spelling as me i
don't know
i thought you win guess he you win

[09:31]
i thought you win guess he you win
like yes i'm not blocking any straights
but i do think on that river he
he bets king queen yes he doesn't have
much value but on the other side he
probably also doesn't have much bluffs
now i really want to know what he had

[09:45]
now i really want to know what he had
guys tell me what he had
for the people also following me follow
mr gezzy
and we are in guess he be
what did you have guezzy oh
we had a three he had a three i made a
good fault

[10:01]
unbelievable
the rng is going to allow it shout out
to guezzy man
good fault i i never fold man he knows i
never fall
let me see what he thinks

[10:16]
i'd like

[10:30]
river is going to blow us at night
nice game gezzy
[Music]

[10:45]
[Music]
yeah exactly that's what i thought man
he's passed into he told me i'm not
gonna spaz
gg guess he man gg yeah

[11:00]
gg guess he man gg yeah
i'm gonna ride the wave of doing well

[11:26]
um
okay we're just going to bat call it off

[11:31]
okay we're just going to bat call it off
even though not very thrilled about it
but
i think that's fine
we have enough equity and i think we
have an okay hand to
double barrel i'm planning on going bad
bad

[11:46]
bad
jager is small which i think is an okay
strategy i like it
and actually i think i'm going to jam if
you look at his main bluff
see i think he does check race even on
the bigger side
uh i think if you look at his main bluff

[12:02]
uh i think if you look at his main bluff
what akamo you don't deserve to win this
hat man
okay okay i'm just gonna bat pot

[12:46]
go for a little raise here with the king
blocking the the jackax suited
we're a little bit deeper so it makes
more sense to fast play

[13:09]
i think on the turn we have an easy bet

[13:23]
so with like our exact blockers

[13:34]
so with like our exact blockers
i think if he has a hand like queens uh
we obviously don't want him to realize
as he will make the best hand anything
if he has queens kings
tents he's just in a very tough spot if

[13:45]
tents he's just in a very tough spot if
he has the same hand he will fold king
queen suited queen dan suited so i think
it's a
fine hand to double barrel
with three bet here with the jack dance
suit

[14:01]
low disconnected flop i can think
i think i can definitely get some bets
here

[14:23]
because insect turn

[14:31]
because insect turn
i think we have to barrel

[15:04]
yeah really again oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
uh yeah yeah yeah yeah

[15:17]
jack 10 yourself
and
would you play eights this way

[15:31]
you have a very good hand though
oh

[15:50]
[Music]
i have no clue guys can you have spades

[16:06]
tense
what does he have eights
uh i should probably just call this but

[16:16]
uh i should probably just call this but
i'm not happy
eights he did have eights
he did have the eights
i'm gonna apply some pressure

[16:57]
they're going to do a poker bros poker

[17:02]
pros
thinking about it

[17:16]
you gotta race he has a very tough time
here
hey he did indeed race
how did he think so long about raising

[17:38]
okay oh
just blank the river we calm down

[17:58]
do

[18:02]
we have a lower flush like five six of
clubs or something
eight seven o'clock stays five o'clock
or you could be turning like a

[18:18]
i have no clue what this guy has

[18:40]
weird

[18:46]
got it in here with the ace king and he
won
the seven deuce to close it off we got a
seven dudes to cross it out that's
[ __ ] great so i'm ready to [ __ ]
