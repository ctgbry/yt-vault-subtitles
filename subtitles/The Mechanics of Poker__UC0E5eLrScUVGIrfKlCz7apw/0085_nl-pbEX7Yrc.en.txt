[00:00]
so we're just going to keep on firing
we're even blocking a jack 9 suited how
amazing is his hand he calls that's
literally the worst river in the [ __ ]
deck
[Music]

and i'm looking forward to seeing you in
the academy yes yes yes yes yes hello
hello hello my fellow poker friends

[00:47]
how are you all doing okay
when i'm tired i usually lean towards
knitty lines so
for the people watching don't expect me
to try to triple barrel bluff you all
that often

[01:00]
that often
when i'm in this mood
just a little a little tip
and i'm gonna call that race if you give
me a second
yeah that's straight and here with jax

[01:18]
yeah that's straight and here with jax
i'll sometimes call sometimes four bets
high numbers i'll go for the four but
this time
and he calls his king first flip of the
day obviously we're winning

[01:30]
day obviously we're winning
that's how we do it
how
okay that's not the great result not a
great result guys another great result
see if we can win our money back here
with jax again

[01:45]
with jax again
deja vu
that seems uh like a little 10 percenty
you know we love the ten percent here

[02:03]
and i think on the turn i'm gonna go for
the
check
he checks as well

[02:17]
river is a bit uh can kind of go either
way
i think
i'm gonna go for the check call

[02:32]
even though obviously having jacks is
not great oh he went all in yeah
now uh maybe i'll reconsider so that's a
good sizing of uh of our friend sd
maxxon so actually it's gonna be 2-0 for
maxon that's uh

[02:47]
maxon that's uh
what we're looking at here
okay
yeah good play what can i say good play
here we go for a little donkey donkey

[03:00]
here we go for a little donkey donkey
donkey on the turn
oh we have a little subscriber
this is a quite a good river i would say

[03:18]
he jams
and
i think we're going to call not too
thrilled about it
but
could maybe have a worse eight
could he
it's a little bit likely but

[03:31]
it's a little bit likely but
unlikely maybe eight nine actually would
be a better but yeah
he has better he has better nine ten
it's very unlucky god damn it it's very
unlucky
it's very unlucky

[03:48]
can i even play in this game i mean what
the [ __ ] they find oh i mean what the
i mean how can i even play in this game
it's like i just get cheated i mean hand
after hand after hand

[04:01]
after hand after hand
open the ace 9
call here
checks back
i'm present sure what to do i think i'll

[04:15]
i'm present sure what to do i think i'll
go again for a little uh induction
sizing
you're just back big
actually i'm just gonna be big
here we get check raised
with the a7

[04:37]
so
okay turn six nine suited did make a
straight but let's say he did have
pocket dates for h8 we have now improved

[04:48]
he blocks
and i think we're gonna proceed by
calling
i wouldn't mind another block
oh and then he jams

[05:01]
oh and then he jams
so now basically he's saying that he has
a straight or a screen
we're
in a bluff catching scenario and now
actually we would i think and not like
her hand i think if he had like seven
six or something he could play this way
as a bluff some of the time

[05:16]
so
i'm going to fault
let me over three betting pocket jacks
for his mister as the maximum it's 2-0
for mr as the maximum so far but let's
see how this is gonna go

[05:33]
it's what they call a good flop for us
i'm gonna start with a bet
a very good turn

[05:46]
so we're just gonna keep on firing we're
even blocking a jack 9 suited how
amazing is his hand
he calls it's literally the worst river
in the [ __ ] deck
now what do we do

[06:02]
think
we're going to go for a little 10
and he calls thank you very much sir

[06:16]
and he calls thank you very much sir
guys i'm a greedy dutch guy 12 bb it's
like a dinner
this is like a dinner
free
dinner
on sd maxxon's
money
what did he have

[06:31]
what did he have
yeah pocket sevens pocket seven's no

okay guys today is a very challenging

[07:01]
okay guys today is a very challenging
day in the in the poker streets
as my brain is confirmed not working
but
let's try to make the best of
it you know what you know those times

[07:17]
it you know what you know those times
when you're just looking at the screen
but yeah nothing just literally just
nothing comes out i think this guy is in
has the
as a boat
i'm gonna cut this one actually

[07:33]
where did you get the you [ __ ] dunk
clip from i need to show to friends in
our 1020 home game
it's from um
lily on the coach on the youtube
coaching
youtube channel of best poker coaching

[07:48]
this is uh how they uh
i'll decide to represent our bet here
i'm gonna i'm gonna apply a little trick
that i heard from the people in the past
don't chase on pair boards so you know

[08:00]
don't chase on pair boards so you know
just in case he does have fours or nine
and three with the puck kid aces again
versus sd maxson
get forward to a date night suited and
everyone here knows on the stream i hate
aiden cities so i'm not gonna put
even a penny
in the pot

[08:17]
yes sd max on
this flopper
this flop can be played
in a couple ways
with my exact combination
i am gonna go for a

[08:32]
i am gonna go for a
small bet
and i'm gonna go for a barrel

[08:46]
really wacko why because i have two aces
oh i call the asking
organskington4

[09:19]
try a little crazy
he calls

[09:49]
we jam the turn
and defaults

[10:03]
actually what actually did the other guy
call me down with
all the way in the beginning with the
king queen okay let's set the trap here
with the with the ace king

[10:19]
we actually probably have to go quite
far back those king queen was also
through the pot that's why i remembered

[10:32]
a little ten percent i can appreciate
that sir i can appreciate that i can
appreciate that very much
you have all the support from the wacko
show
with a little ten percent here

[10:57]
is that the king queen oh he caught me
with one lower okay fair he had jack

[11:01]
with one lower okay fair he had jack
queen that hand
ten percent again okay okay respect
respect

[11:22]
i think actually not gonna throw in a
little raisin

[11:35]
clearly a fan of the channel guys this
guy is clearly a fan of the channel
we should have the best hand i would say

[11:48]
he calls
me i think if he has aces or kings he's
probably checking
so
yo guys know what time it is i think

[12:01]
yo guys know what time it is i think
it's just time to ship it in and go to
bed

[12:16]
he has aces why do you bet aces
[Music]
okay good for you my friend well played
people have way too much of a pre-flop
range fetish guys

[12:42]
bad haircut 1986

[13:02]
oh
okay
[Music]

[13:21]
really no one is interested in this
butter

[13:43]
manny had a four so i have manny manny's

[13:46]
manny had a four so i have manny manny's
in and actually guys we did finally
start flopping sets was about [ __ ]
time
we faced a 72 percent bet
missing with a bad haircut
i think actually i'm gonna
no i'm just gonna call maybe sexy bieber

[14:02]
no i'm just gonna call maybe sexy bieber
or something
oh sexy he's thinking about it
it calls okay

[14:19]
check check check check check
we have a call

[14:32]
i mean i assume we still have the best
hand
it cost me a two pair quite quickly okay
thank you very much sir

[14:46]
thank you very much sir
yeah
he thinks uh we're a little bit crazier
feel the power
you feel my power baby
feel my power
okay okay trappy trappy here with pocket

[15:00]
okay okay trappy trappy here with pocket
aces let's see how that goes
practicing the flat call here

[15:17]
he bets again i'm probably just gonna
get it in there's just so much
so much draws that i can now get value
from
if he has an overpair i don't want to
scare carter off even though you know
we're not that deep but

[15:31]
we're not that deep but
yeah
i think this is the time
all that all that trapping for nothing
we could have just got it in
we could have just gotten it in

[15:47]
this hand with
a heart
and the
spate i guess could sometimes check
raise as well low frequency we also have
ace queen here

[16:00]
ace queen here
but he bets big so then i think the
calling uh
calling is kind of gone
a little donkey donkey here on the turn
he calls

[16:18]
i'm gonna call the river he could bet
the same hand
by the head kings
and we're also blocking kings

[16:33]
okay for the one third going to go for a
check raise
ah let's do something like that

[16:46]
like pasta city
i'm not really sure who this guy is
okay it's definitely a recreational so

[17:00]
okay it's definitely a recreational so
let's consider if i wanted to overbought
the turn if he called but if he's a
recreational i'm not gonna do that but
now i'm definitely calling
that's oh
that is such a nice turn he's gonna pop
and i'm gonna jam and it's all happy

[17:16]
and i'm gonna jam and it's all happy
life
oh my god this is such a nice turn
insane
how did you not jam
what do you have

[17:30]
what do you have
when you click back
an 8
what do you have
a king
hey

[17:46]
okay i lost a lot of value okay i
completely uh completely misread the
situation i guess
i figured the king
if he had a king good enough to three
bet the flop you would just always bet

[18:00]
bet the flop you would just always bet
the turn it's so scary
so i saw no point in batting the river
then i thought okay then it's just
something funky so then i check
it's always easy to do if he's doing
this with king jack i should just bet
the river now if you liked this video
