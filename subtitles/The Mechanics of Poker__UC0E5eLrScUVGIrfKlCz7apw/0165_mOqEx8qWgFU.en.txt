nine plus yeah just by those odds we
actually make it but if someone has the
not flash shot that would not be great
could be that someone has a set

[Music]

available seats without further ado
that out of the way let's get into the
action playing some Zoom
I think I've said before very easy
format to make some videos on you just
uh press record
you're hopping the pool oh it's actually
very small and I don't know
almost anyone I know two guys
just gonna try to play somewhat solid
look for weakness wherever we can
or deviate
we think it's appropriate
make more money but also look for
areas of the three where I think
our opponents will be leaning towards
being a bit too strong they're
definitely fine
avoid putting too money and too much
money in the pot when when that's the
case instead of something but for the
mid race I think I'll lean a bit more
towards calling please check on the flop
how much else we can do turn is
interesting
we will definitely be continuing with a
five
obviously with the King obviously with
the Jack we have some Paris probably
this is getting close towards the fault
very close up probably this might even
be a frequency call I don't know really
what this sizing is 62 percent
the bit
a bit dicey
not dicey I think it's a it can be
either medium or weak so I'll decide to
Pew this one rivers of seven should
connect with this range a bit
in terms of six seven which I'm not
expect him to to
check behind it's a very it's a very
weak-ish line it feels a bit like I had
like King eight which blocks it it's
good King Nine in ten
I'm curious
pink Queen
here we have the solution for the turn
seasoning strategy position you can see
the majority of the bets are gonna be an
overbat there are some bets that there's
some hands that want to bet three
quarters mainly driven by pocket kings
and indeed like a hand like King 10 or I
guess king queen so in a vacuum you
could say that this hand was played okay
because king queen indeed wants to bat
three quarters at a decent frequency
uh he even better a little bit smaller I
think the smaller you go the more you
just want to check uh and you can
actually see that also with for example
at like King 10 obviously and then it's
also a little bit weaker but the reason
why we want to over bat is simply
because we have a very big another
Advantage if you look at hands that have
80 Equity or more
um
we have that around 90 whereas a big
blind has that only eight percent so the
bottom wants to build a pot uh strategy
around another Advantage therefore it
starts opening a lot we have a lot of
hands in the 70 80 Equity range which is
going to be a king and the way 80 to 90
and 90 100 Equity hands maximizes versus
arrange it has a lot of 70 80 hands is
by doing a lot of over betting okay
so therefore I think in general you
should use a big bad strategy
if we look at the handset if it is
allowed to Barrel you look at the draws
take all the draws here
you also check 40 of the time you can
practice it's quite easy to Barrel a lot
of your draws here on the jack I think
it's a bit more true if it goes five
three Jack King I think that's
definitely a spot where people share all
the draws here maybe a little bit less
but still I think
this is definitely a hands that people
are going to find more often than not
which I guess is good for our specific
hand we should also Barrel some ACE
highs obviously the ace four days do
make a lot of sense because it draws A7
A6 I guess it's mainly with a diamond so
there's definitely the ace of diamonds I
think people could definitely find it so
this usually something that I look for
when I'm in a marginal block catch
scenario like what are the Bluffs and
How likely do I find it for people to
find them too often or too little ones
usually in spots where people find them
too little it's easier for your goal to
be losing and if you think it's easier
that people find them a lot it's easier
for your cult winning if you look at
three quarters in general and my
specific hand
actually pocket eights with a diamond
is actually calling quite often so at
least you know it's gonna really be a
big mistake definitely think if you have
a diamond you should not be calling I
also fought in game the seven sixes were
way worse uh simply because of the seven
six and what we also saw was A7 and the
A6 barreling quite often as well nice
actually I thought would be worse than
eight because Nine's blocks way more
hands like Queen nine and Nintendo
people will Barrel so I was in my head I
was like okay it is actually probably
the parish Ace is probably the best I
would never have folded the five so
I would have definitely overcalled this
spot but then again I'm I'm adjusting to
the sizing that I think is quote quote
less of a thing and that could
potentially be weaker so therefore I
decided to over call her with eights and
then on the river the river was a seven
s plate
I think in position gonna bet king queen
actually he bet it he played his hand in
a vacuum actually quite well
so shout out to him it's not really a
line that I would have taken uh and then
I think we have an okay Bluff catcher
probably with pocket eights no it's just
snap folding and it's calling more of
his 5X
find it but like I said in theory it's
it's a bit like you cannot really look
at this in theory uh because we were
going off an assumption that that range
weaker and you know sometimes wrong
sometimes right kind of how it works if
you look at in terms of how often he's
allowed to Bluff he's allowed to Bluff
most of the time
32.8 percent if you give up is Bluffs
and then obviously if you have a bluff
catchers then estimate if that's
realistic
like I said we didn't really know this
player this was just an assumption I
thought it was weak I called I was wrong
that's how poker goes sometimes
if you're going into a bit more
exploitative territory
check my Karen is bored
I'll go for the overbat
and the five press is not the greatest
card I still think we that's like one of
the benefits of over betting Ace Jack
here you will sometimes call you with A7
or like an A5 flush draw
like A6 or something and when we check
he checks behind and we sometimes chop
or win
that's why I think Ace Check one of them
on a small small additional values of
over betting
Ace Jack there
go to see video with sixes seven another
boy that I will see but at a very high
frequency
seven seven is quite good for him and
also in terms of connectivity around the
eight and the three in the future
turn I think we have a mandatory check
without a club maybe with a club we
could sneak in a bit but I think so
Ace King Jack these are boards that are
quite favorable for us
um
and I think we're just gonna bet
and I think when people check here
hmm
it's close I'll go for a bet this is I
think a bit disrespect to
my opponent Maybe
here we decided to go for a bad turn
Queen
quite
even I think we get to do a lot of
betting here
I think I would prefer to have a club so
I would definitely Bear all my prayers
with a club not sure if this hand would
make it
could I could be convinced so I think
I'll move this one to a bad check bet
instead
but yeah the reason why I just bet the
Flop is mainly
to
sort of keep con keep delete if you
check back you allow him to Bluff you
sometimes
so it's mainly a bet I would say for
Bluff prevention and you can do that
simply because you have an equity
advantage on on these type of boards
it's a safe return I'm pretty sure if I
had a club I would definitely
uh need to barrel and wood barrel
so the pocket seven cents I want to
actually start in the Flop we can indeed
see we can just bet a lot on this board
for the reasons that I've explained we
have a huge Equity Advantage 65.1
percent but at one third you can even
implement the bigger sizings usually at
these three i-card boards you see
there's a lot that basically all sizes
are being used in my opinion just pick a
sizing and start using that if I would
be in a little bit later position
usually I bet a little bit bigger and if
I'm in an earlier position I'll bet a
little bit smaller I can definitely see
half button
well then we were mainly interested for
the turn
and on the turn we were considering
batting pocket sevens I think we
mentioned that
or at least I mentioned that I wanted to
have a club this is definitely an
assumption that we're going to check
if we look at nines and eights we can
indeed see that the club having the club
is very good so that reverse sets that
it's always a good set and more down we
actually go the more seems to matter a
little bit less
uh so the club back affects us a little
bit less
in general I am actually a little bit
surprised I would have imagined that the
lower pairs which is always Barrel
because basically the higher and you do
see a little bit of a trend I guess but
this is also just because we have those
hands at a lower frequency pre-flop but
what I would think is let's say he has a
hand like
you will have more bumper hands that
have an eight and nine seven in their
hand like he would defend Jack seven
suited three King seven suited he would
not defend King three
um King three who probably still defend
objectively suited so basically if we
have three he will have more one pairs
so that makes a lower pair a better
Barrel than uh a higher ish pair than
for example
but yeah so pocket sevens even without a
club is sometimes barreling
I mean at least I would be battling with
the club and like I said if at a lower
pair with always Barrel so I don't think
I'm butchering this spot that much I
actually still want a bat small quite
often again we probably still have the
advantage no we don't have the advantage
anymore but
that's an overall Advantage like villain
has a lot of the hands in the lower
category and we perform a little bit
better in this area so we still have
um
a reasonable higher Equity type
advantage because we have a lot of two
pair sets trades a little bit more but
we have redrawals so if he has a
straight he probably only yeah that's
basically it but as soon as the board
pairs we have an advantage again so in
the future we definitely have an
advantage again and we can already
invest in that right so a lot of
blocking going on that would have you'd
be decising I also would have better
checked that by hand let's see if that's
a thing
X I would have now definitely bluffed
pocket sevens I that would have been
okay so I'm not too disappointed in
terms of in-game how I thought this spot
would be played
I think seven up I think is normally a
fault
it's for the steak
according to you
this board is actually quite good for
him
with the wheel connecting
and the board is two-tone so I
definitely need to incorporate some
tracks and I think seven
nine
call
turn is four
you could definitely dunk on this card
quite a lot
or small sizing that's what I'm gonna do
king seven we're just gonna check again
I hope to get The Showdown I think with
the seven we will not be calling a bet
as we block a lot of his Bluffs with the
seven and the Heart
and on the river we should never bet
this end we block way too much of his
folding range and we have a tiny bit of
shot on value if he decides to check
back
um the King High
River nine I think you know it's the
same drill we just uh keep on checking
and we're probably just falling to a bet
260 puppet
this ski guy I think is the guy from the
first time we played I think it was
pocket Eights
I gotta know this guy but seems a bit
fishy right the sizing that he took
oh actually I should have made probably
three but this the guys are recreational
about half pot and exactly 62 percent
again on the turn so
I I don't really know guys recreational
or yet
not
because he's repeating the same betting
betting pattern like me raise half Bots
to third ish
eight four again probably
close to a fold
sake of playing some pots I'll open it
X3 we can three bet we can call
but
this time
then I mean because we're recording
but RNG is High guys the RNG is high
when we record a YouTube video to RNG
cannot say this on Twitch because they
might people you know or might be
playing against node Mr G is high but on
YouTube videos RNG is high
like both car here from the fast 14.
usually sign of someone being a
recreational player
this board
check seven nine I'll approach big bat
check
because it's quite connective
big bats in three bad pots and they'll
go for a check here I like that this
guy's been shown to do some words of
this guy I think a recreational
but I think checking and
giving a recreational and what I assume
to be a weaker player as well some
options
usually extra money
he thinks about it for quite a while and
checks this is probably you know unless
he's just doing other things this could
be some sort of a timing tell that he
was considering betting
like I would definitely I would heavily
discount medium and it's like eights
nines or something from his range
so he's either fast folding now
it was just considering maybe maybe turn
out a little bluffy bluffy
he didn't
here
in this hand can play either check or
bad in both final
parts
he's thinking about it and that's and I
think oh
set
again he chooses uh
this is a very good card
for me but she was in these positions
I think
gonna go for a slight over bed here
like both with the king queen and the
bucket fives you say that
uh you know he got the maximum amount of
value or something but
you should probably in general when you
have
a lot of like when you have the range
Advantage which you which you could say
that he had in both cases
you should play a strategy like how a
range Advantage makes money is that that
you can get them uh that you play
strategy which allows you to put all the
money in the pot
uh I think in both cases he did not play
a strategy
like that
here
it's a bit close I think given the way
people usually play
I'll go for and over but
check
this is this is a spot where you should
buy some strong checking which
I think from what I've seen so far from
this player and just my general read I
don't think happens so that allows us to
be a bit more aggressive
it'll check over to King Jack
seven Deuce obviously opening
but yeah so in both cases like pocket
fives
you could say that he should have
probably tried to get a stack in so a
better bigger on the turn gem River king
queen
if he over bets turn checks behind River
and some Rivers even jams uh would have
definitely been better this one
I think it's probably a block but
especially if there's a recreation I
just don't think it's gonna work to be
honest because I think if he had like
and said we're trying to Bluff would be
uh
like lower King eyes and queen highs and
Jack highs and they all connect very
well on the turn like Queen 10 Jack 10
Jack 10 back then twice Queen 10 Jack
Queen
so I don't think he has that so I think
it's going to be very one pair heavy or
to Bear heavy on that River or straight
heavy on that River very Showdown heavy
like I would say that we want to worry
about quite thin there and I don't think
we want to Bluff
uh versus recreational if we bet we need
to prepare it probably pretty big but
he has quite of two persons traits as
well on that River so yeah I
I don't like betting small I just don't
think it's going to work often enough
and that big I think he just has too
much
still strongish hands in his range
that that can play back versus big so
yeah
I'll just give up that one I think it's
gonna give up
but yes so come back to the story
definitely uh valuable
all of my videos accordingly she don't
really know what
it's gone this one
there's a recreational I'll just start
off with a small bet
I think from with this exact hand I'm
already looking ahead in terms of hero
calling River you could sometimes Bluff
with better
so you could also just make an argument
for betting a bit bigger with this hand
but
and this River
I'm done
that
medium and allow him the chance to race
he decides to
he should definitely still be uncapped
here like you should definitely check H4
Ace 8 on all streets the high frequency
so it's not like we River ace deuce you
know we can just over bet
I prefer to just use this sizing
and still be able to let's say we
checked back Queen 10 twice
now the river now the question is do we
re-raise
I don't think so
pretty close is for never is it always
if it closes one probably in theory
no
Ice King could definitely check
offspruits first River
I think Force AIDS Queens
in theory are going to be in there quite
often
I think a practice is a bit more ace
four is it that's that's at some Street
a bit more often Maybe
phase eight actually I also want to
start in the Flop so
why the
um
quite a decent checking frequency still
for him Ace eight is Ace four definitely
hands that he should be checking quite
often eights and fours four is less than
eight I think these are definitely hands
that people could
that a little bit more often especially
on the turn when it becomes uh very dry
so I would reduce it some of the time
but as you can see your pocket Force
pocket ace would still be tracking quite
a lot Ace H still be talking second
quite a lot H4 I think it's very
intuitive check then on the river
let me see how much of the strong hands
he should check towards us if we look at
straight straight should basically
always check it's actually quite
interesting would have imagined that's
more of a block
uh set you should still check quite
often 42.6 percent especially the apocal
dates which makes a lot of sense if you
slow play always want to see
uh which hand you're losing value from
so if we check the hand that he could
mainly call with and he's going to check
behind this and eight so then having two
eights makes a low play a bit more
so Eights
it was definitely a hint that I would be
concerned about but I do think people
fast played it a bit more on flop and
turn
um then it gets checked towards us A7
obviously bet I was debating sizing I
ended up on this recordering
your strategy we bet now villain races
obviously if he gets there with the
value hands that we mentioned
Grace he went somewhere in between
see what do we do seven
so yeah it's already closed like I
mentioned 808 simplest calling in theory
and the re-ray sizing also I was
debating it's a little bit somewhere I
just clicked the button uh
you know this this kind of things go
quite intuitive I thought it was close
it indeed seems close but then if you
remove some slow plays then I think it's
fine
uh
but I was actually still actually quite
surprised if you look at the overall
strategy for example should never
basically check race uh is four should
basically always bet himself as well
same with Ace eight actually I thought
these hands would check a little bit
more often now obviously if he has H4
and his game more often then I re-race
becomes quite good but like I said
that's just at least in theory you know
I'm not I'm not doing anything crazy and
the rest again is just assumptions that
you would have to check yeah if Francis
for example be a hand attack with Mark
and discuss with other people to see
what they think
it's King it's a wheel board which means
that we definitely have gems but we're a
bit deeper
makes me a bit more concerned
we had a Spate I think it's good but I
think in general this King
there's just not much else he called
pretty fast as well
which I think reduces like slow plays
from his range I'm just gonna go for the
gem here
I think it's
it's the play that I know cannot really
be bad it's very hard to
say exploit this sort of
so when I'm not really sure I'll just go
for the jam
he calls with Ace Jack diamonds this is
one of the benefits of the gem but
mainly he would for example maybe call
it like some flush draws which is very
very good for us
you put him or this in theory you put
him in a tough spot with
Exxon pairs
here for his whole pot step
a recreation with this stack size I
think I'm I'm gonna make a nitty fold
the goal of also Broadways
so let's say yes Queen 9 off suit or
something that still gives him a gutter
in this spot for example a hand that he
that we definitely look to get value
from if we have Ace Kings for example
Ace Queen with a spade plus draws and it
also just let's say he has Jack 10 of
the diamonds or something if he just
Falls that that's actually quite a good
result for us because we're out of
position we we don't have great
playability when we're out of position
this is another board that
uh
uh I will use a different strategic
approach depending on if I three bet
from the small blind or the big blind
given how the big blind trivet range is
constructed compared to the small line
it just gives you
it gives you a bigger Advantage when
you're at a small blind because you
three but linear very broadly heavy
so from the small blind that we just
probably arranged with this board for
small and from the big blind I would
that big and check
and I think this hand will make the
check twice
he's building this board
you should you should definitely be
careful betting this board too often I
think I have two options I could raise
or call
that's one third I think we have um we
have to call this but
not too thrilled about it
now I think you're on the turn we
probably play over by check
usually people
bat this board a bit too often on the
Flop so I do expect actually to get
why a lot of thoughts on the turn
and if you think people just oversee but
I think maybe using a smaller setting on
the turn could also make a lot of sense
and I think on the river I'm just gonna
folds it's very hard for my opponent
here to
to show up at the bluff
on that then and just give in the way I
play with this player before
like I'm gonna turn them already but
Ajax 6 here on the Flop definitely a
different strategy from the big line to
speak quite a lot of checking going on
that's what I did and then on the turn I
think
things there's no sense of betting in
general in these type of spots when you
check you should just do a lot of
checking again this kind of General
guideline and on the turn as you can see
basically in position should only
use a big sizing
the smaller signs are basically from a
theoretical Point not really a thing
because there are no incentives to bat
medium hands you're not incentivized to
bat Jack like the king Jack that's
betting here is clearly bluffing right
so basically you want to bet a good Ace
or better so you should be exciting if
he does bad one third like I said this
true is gonna this tree is going to be
quite screwed we're actually folding the
King of Clubs a little bit more often
than without it
that's probably something to do with the
fact that he's buffing for clubs so
we're blocking a bit more of the
bluffing range you could see here for
example King jacket clubs sometimes
bluffing so if we don't have Kings of
clubs we have here's less Bluffs
probably the same with King 10. so
probably Kings in general should be a
full tear
because we block a bit too much of the
bluffing rain and in general like I said
I think I was playing as a player that I
think is a bit weaker
so actually I don't like my call I think
this is donating money
uh services
Mrs ski
no
just two racing take it down with seven
dudes
I already saw them three betting small
when we had the 10 8 off I hope to get
small again which allows us to get in
there with seven nine and again he does
he's he's pretty consistent with his
with deciding
so like I said I'm a bit confused it was
a recreational or a regular who just
use it like some sub-optimal type of
strategies
so people then
for example when I play this be
something people ask what what do you
see that's going wrong it's just I would
say usually sub optimal strategies being
used
like we already saw a couple of examples
of that
kind of three bed this I'm pretty sure
it's a recreational player
or at least somewhat normally you have
to be a bit careful 150 big blind is
deep off suit hand I think I could have
also just called in hindsight
King do seven I think I'm just gonna
start off with a small bat
King we don't have the
the king jacksu the blocker so let's say
we have the king of hearts or the the
King of Diamonds I would might lean way
more towards betting I don't have the
Queen of Clubs I would also lean more
towards betting because there's more
hands to get value from I think this
exact combination I think is fine and to
check
and we're just gonna call down hope he
has something like a low pair like force
with a club or something that he decides
to turn into a bluff or a screen a stand
event like H5 a Hearts stuff like that
and basically for Value he has three
combinations of sevens I guess this
player could have deuces
so again he goes for like
a medium-ish strategy again I would say
a sub optimal strategy
but maybe we're just donating money
again yes we're donating money to him
again
but it's it's
how can I say we've done with their
monitoring now three times so obviously
people are watching like hey
maybe I should look up the YouTube
channel of Mr ski 92 because this guy
seems to know what he's doing
but I would say in all instances
you would lose money
like always hands I think lose money
from a strategy perspective
and you could also say yeah well it
might be it may have maximized against
your hand I think it maximize against
the pocket eights because pocket eights
if he uses a quote quote normal strategy
where he over bets the turn I just fold
most likely yes
I would say so most of the time
but I I could I could be convinced from
an exploitive perspective that I would
still call pocket AIDS there with the
diamond in that very first hand the Asia
would have definitely called down
all the way and queen I would have
called down all the way even though we
were maybe a little bit deeper
but I would have probably never folded
as well so yes he has 246 big blinds
right now but should have had more
and this is this is kind of the Trap as
well right of Poker you can look at the
hands that you won or you'd be like hey
I'm winning so I'm probably probably
playing well not getting the maximum out
of your strong hands is a very big
league
there Mr ski 92 is watching free
coaching
and sure from let's say he in all
scenarios when he had a bluff he would
he would be betting bigger and with this
value he would size a little bit down
because you know great
from an exposed perspective
that could be the case especially at
lower Stakes you know there are some
spots where you can definitely be
exploitative in terms of always having
value or I was having bluffing
certificate is something that I would
definitely not recommend doing
unless from maybe a very specific line
but as a general approach a very sub
optimal and you're teaching yourself bad
habits that you would have to unlearn
when you move up
I think it's better to
is
pretty bad
um
uh the story was rainbow I think it
would
see that we could still see that
it's a bit close
bit close I think I'm gonna check and
and see
like this is benefit of recreationals
the faster you know bats are the bigger
you know that's the more I'm gonna lean
towards fault he didn't that fast but he
did that big so I'm gonna fold let's say
at the top bottom oh
I prefer against recreationals is the
fact that they give you more information
about the strength of their hand I think
doing more checking and adjusting
accordingly is uh definitely beneficial
but if the board was rainbow I would
start
just like here I think just starting off
with a c bet
it's fine again I think a recreational
player
it's a bit close what we want to do on
the turn
with a heart I'm gonna lean towards
barreling
snap calls that means usually that that
he has something and I don't think
there's a lot of maid hands that are
going to fold the river
and we have a heart so I think I'm going
to lean towards giving up
so the fact that he has five four off
suit is kind of I was I was like I think
in this type of spots when you're in
position against a recreational well you
know you know it's going to be very very
loose versus pre-flop already and first
year one third bet
you should basically play all your hands
to try to win the pot
especially with the range that you're
opening
so with king queen I was considering
checking and hero calling River the
problem with that is that recreationals
they Bluff is high on the river that's a
problem
you could then also raise the river
that's definitely an option
but like I said I decided that the fact
that I had a heart
you know it gives him a little bit more
faults on the turn so our full Equity
goes up and if the rivers are hard we
have a little bit more old equity in the
barrel as well
so I think if it didn't have art I would
just check
um
race River
again Mr ski gonna go for a half bet
here in a spot where in my opinion he's
only incentivized to bet very strong
hands and check his medium and basically
if you think about that that would
that would ever mean he should use the
bigger sizing
but so far you know we've been we've
been just heading money
this time he actually bets a little bit
bigger than in the previous cases
I think I'm still just gonna call simply
because I think the guy's a recreational
player and they can show up with just
about anything
it's probably going to be call and lose
quite often
okay Queen Jack
our persistency uh paid off

poker.com and apply for the program and
maybe you will get a chance to work with
me and Adam and make more progress in
your poker career this is actually a
hint and a spot where
I'm gonna be a little bit
I think this specific hand can probably
make it in big bets
not entirely sure
I think then a heart specifically it has
some benefits like on these type of
boards
when you're EP your range is just so
strong
that you should already start bluffing
like somebody in pairs
like I said I can see more I can see
some benefits in like ink Queen maybe
betting
especially without a club actually
because being extra clubs and for
example you could call twice so if you
that bad in Queen you could actually
sometimes check the back the river and
be up against the lower King but then
again king queen obviously beats more
King X so you can just attack and and
win more often
here it is I'm gonna throw out a donkey
play
but yeah we we finally got him
so he was not using the strategy where
he would always bet medium
this is actually one of the few ants
that I would check this term with I
think I'm not really sure if I should
check this turn
you could bet a very high frequency here
I'm gonna check it's not a bit close
eight nine here I'm gonna go for a check
and just and see what happens again
there's a recreational player on
let's onboard it fine
it's half pots
a bit temptable
you did cool
simply because again
I'm gonna assume again that this guy is
a little bit weaker
and then I think first is the lead
it would raise strong hands
too often which leaves his calling range
quite weak
I think the deuce is very good for me
in terms of uh I'm gonna nothing in
terms of that they don't think it's
gonna vary back to thin anymore and
that's gonna leave way too much Bluffs
in his range like Dan Jack with a heart
or something
and that point actually did show because
he checked back trips
so this is another classic leak of
recreationals
why they so this is also like why they
often over Bluff simply because they
forget to worry about their hands like a
five years probably worth an over but
so I would have definitely hear a call
which if he checks back five again
confirms five
to your call this one's a bit dicey
I think I'm gonna check it down
I should probably Bluff but I feel like
this line is very as high heavy and if
he has trash
basically all the trash will have a five
or a seven I will indeed sometimes lose
against like stupid nine high or
something but
yeah I feel I feel like this is more
likely I feel like we should either
start firing on the flop
yeah or like the way the boards run out
I'll just check it down but I could be
convinced otherwise for example on the
river to just overbat
expect to
win money it was a bit similar to the
king Jack earlier but I think if we want
to get a full we should probably bet
quite big
maybe I should just be big
definitely yeah
option
we gotta call pocket threes I think the
Jack 8 is high enough that
starts to favor me that I can just bat a
lot
unlike the 774 or something earlier I
think rocketry says no business betting
you're betting here I think it's
definitely a mistake
then it's quite a bad card in terms of
connecting with this floating range of a
nine Queen nine stuff like that and
the river should then be turning
let's say asking Queen you should
definitely turn it into a bluff
same with
maybe like some a size probably you
should turn like some ice ice into a
bluff and usually see players not
turning aside into a bluff here we have
a Spate which is not great
a threes it's very close
if I didn't have a spade I would
definitely call here and probably we
should
still call here
the jacket Jack 8 actually on the Flop I
saw a bit more checks and I would
probably do I thought this board was
it actually it is very good for us so
maybe when when you have quite an
advantage as we have here if you do bet
a little bit more often it's not really
a big point a big deal on the turn I was
mentioning don't Barrel pocket threes
let's see that's correct that's correct
whenever we're never betting again with
these Lopez
and on the river villain
uh shoot in the bluff a lot of Ace highs
a lot of King highs so if you look at
uh if he has air on the river which is
quite often he should Bluff it very
often so that's again something that I
would always look at
uh to block a lot of his highs so if you
shoot already Bluff a lot of Ace highs
that already made me feel like not not
too easy to over Bluff
like if you're Ace highs is is probably
the hand that people should should start
over bluffing with if you want to
here we can see the threes indeed
despite like I mentioned in game with
these low barriers having a spade is
just not great
and like I said I don't know how often
people Bluff it's high but I intuitively
thought not that often so that's why I
fold it
I think it's uh it's good in both Theory
and
at very low frequency
king queen it seems like a good hand to
Barrel
we block some of the 5x which is good
this port I think I'm gonna approach
kick back check again
I think starting
small new ones here like it's Queen nine
six
whereas if it's between 10 6 so your Ace
Jacks and your Ace Kings start to
connect connect that's definitely a
difference
I'm going to actually check this hand
like I got a cold call it's a hand that
I definitely don't want to bet and get
raised with
and we can just always check call I
think also if we check we call and the
turn is a king or an ace we can quite
credibly represent that
here are the Kings a bit tempted to bet
because the turn connects quite a lot of
hence for his range
probably doesn't have a king I feel like
walking is probably the best option
because I feel like he could now
sometimes follow me with a nine which is
good he could raise Ace jackass Queen
he's always going to raise his trait and
then we can just get it in
here
hmm
open Ender
damn it here
yeah
we would have probably got the money in
anyway
yeah we have uh
nine plus
yeah just by those odds we actually make
it but if someone has the not flash shot
that would not be great
could be that someone has a set and
space
probably close let's gamble guys
I was even winning against him
but he indeed had a set something that I
was a little bit afraid of
so in this this example we're at 26 we
needed 27 so we missed one percent ah
I'm willing to take a gamble for this
for for YouTube with a one percent
disadvantage there
it's five eight
two tone
not that this poor too often Queen eight
we have an easy caller on the turn
with extra equity and unblocking like
the Bluffs
seems like probably my Prime candidates
to be calling determined with
you know in stat checks the river
it's bad news guys
I feel like winning small because it's
gonna fold anyway
but then the other side I think we need
like overbat is best I feel like a lot
of the Rings is gonna insta check
is going to be
a hand is going to fall so it doesn't
really matter
hey Jack I feel like this is a spot
where people usually bet a bit too much
acex
I feel like he's gonna have Ace Jack too
often
especially with the timing
and basically if he just has Ace Jack or
air
and you should just go all in
badly played wacko should have just gone
all in
but I think
King eight of hearts
middle pair
he should not be betting
I don't know okay
you're gonna do something with them this
hand maybe check raise or something
yeah
actually I don't hate it
look at three super deeper raise a bit
smaller let's throw out a call
perfect
nothing
yeah
but I think the river is it so again
this is another mistake often see at
lower Stakes the timing there he's just
giving it away
that's a very big mistake by him
turn I think we can just block
almost range and play from there
you want to say play from there I just
means all my strong hands are also going
to go in the block because let's say he
has a jack replay block block he's gonna
race and then basically from there we
can just re-race here versus A Min bat
I'm just gonna call in
right
keep him let him keep doing his thing
here the proctorism just gonna fold like
I said I'm gonna do this with basically
my whole range I was a six I'll have a
jack I have some better hands borders
parrot so if you you don't want to have
a space when the board is paired
to your first bets Min on the flop
saying that he's a bit weak-ish
now he decides to bomb it
at least for now
yeah so far has been uh aggressive side
but
a worse hand than me buddy
what did I say this in expensive English
very nonsense
now synthetical line is it the word that
doesn't make any sense don't send it
tell a little donkey donkey in the 478
quite a good word for me now and in the
future
turn
we you can use various strategies I will
just continue blocking here but you
could definitely build over bedroom as
well here
is a recreational I believe
at least I have exact recreational I
like to check a lot towards
recreationals
okay
the river we should now definitely start
mixing it up it's very hard for us to
show up with love here I would say 10.
good effect nine
I'm gonna go that's a bit greedy
874 we drew a little donkey donkey
wizard it's a little bit a little bit of
a chicken in my opinion only dunk
bedding eight percent
[Music]
um that's uh that's very passive poker
it's uh Jack five my exact hand I think
I had gloves if I'm not mistaking
actually never dunking again a little
bit of a chicken play
so I did actually go for the dunk and we
can even see the imposition
not very short
I had another dunk bed spot with five
Deuce but I'm reviewing these ants
afterwards I'm not sure if that was
before this one but I think there I
mentioned that
especially I think that player was a
weaker player on the five docent wait to
come or it went so you know and I
expected him or expected in general
people to often raise a bit too much
like top pair good kicker and overpair
type of hands
um
so as soon as he calls to turn four you
would remove some of the stronger hands
I think it leaves the range very
unprotected and I think just that again
basically with a lot of hands in our
range
uh I had the Jack five
it's actually very out of line to be
playing Jack five the way I did
because I think I blocked again
like even Jack five Hearts but to be
fair I would rather have Jack five clubs
as played than Jack five a heart
so he calls again and the river is a six
and there I think yeah we do definitely
need to start splitting obviously in
AIDS vary incentivize a bit small but
there's also a lot of very strong hands
in a Range like two hours is straight
that want to bet a little bit bigger
okay
look at Jack five
in a vacuum it's worth a half pot like
in general the five straight
it's
it's a bit Yeah like 150 is the main bed
sizing which is bad sizing I chose so I
think that's a fine play
by me 910 clearly one so that they could
sometimes even go for a check price but
I guess 9 10
likes you bet a bit more because if you
have a 9 out of 10 he has less Bluffs
because it lost I guess should come from
Jack nine then Jack and a bit more
likely that he has a seven a four and
eight six so therefore you should
probably bet then I'm more often than if
you have like some of the hands that I
just mentioned as you can see here like
seven sixes are definitely answer go for
the check width and check race because
you will have more Bluffs with the Jack
nine the 10 Jack then if we have 9 10
and he will have last seven x and six
six because it has to have
okay so we checked twice here towards
the recreational player
and he now bombs it
the question is do we raise
so
just hope he doesn't have pockets but if
he has pocket for us guys without
no worries there
I feel like this beats yeah I mean I
just want if he has 10 4 which you could
have like two combos he has five four
there's already more combos than pocket
four so we're gonna be ahead more often
than not
and I feel like there's
these are like middle bottom type ish
Pairs and I feel like there's just so
many action killers on the river that
there's a recreational there we're just
forced to raise
four-way with the rec with all
recreational super deep not flush draw
potential definitely in
like because this guy's a recreational
as well I would well let's say this was
another recreational I would definitely
need a bit more
I think it's fine
um
and never thing I'm gonna go for a check
play it a bit more blue line-ish
you could definitely bet as well that's
perfect fine only the outside is that
sometimes you'll get raised especially
your bats he raises and he has a low
flash drive he might fold and obviously
you know your draw becomes a bit more
expensive you already fold out that much
better asex anyway because Ace 10 and
Jack are never folding the only ace nine
I think this is the fine way to play my
obviously folding the river
for obvious reasons the fact that I had
nothing or as they say in Portuguese
or the Portuguese
Brazilian followers
check then of suits
his check already is nine
this could be a recreational so I'm
gonna call
nine three
oh
what the fair don't bomb it you know
all spots
with some back door
love with some Equity potential six and
eight
is Ace eight
again a great example of
he has stopper top kicker on the term
two pair
and you know he didn't really get a lot
of money out of his hand
by him
here
got a race he went half pot to thirds
not neces if you bet half bot I think we
have
we have to basically continue but I
think
recreational's there they're just gonna
have too much hands like 10 Jack Jack
queen queen 10 that was stuff in the
range
you could then either call
you can also raise I think raising makes
sense simply
because all of rivers it's going to be
very hard for us to maneuver obviously
we can deny some Equity I think also on
this board A6 for example said that he
could call it ace four the flush draws
so we get some dim value it's
it denies like some
profitability from him
like for example let's say we have Jack
seven or something
first of all you know the the Bluffs
that he has in his range are gonna have
weight as Equity this guy's Recreation
it's a recreational
here check that's called versus our
Brazilian friend
very big four but
and on the river we will reevaluate the
situation
but I don't think we're gone
bombs
I think that we're gonna start wrapping
it up probably open the seven dudes if
it gets folded to me
I'm gonna start wrapping it up hope you
guys uh
enjoyed this video
it
you could do either way with this end
I'll go for it but
I don't mind attack either
if you like this video guys
tell me in the comments down below why
you liked it
you disagreed with any of the plays
you're free to start a discussion in the
comments section
obviously like this video if you like
dunk bed
you like dumb dunk beds like this video
that's gonna be my motto hey raises we
have I think we have an open end but I
have to double check
in theory you could probably erase his
hand let me see seven nine ten but I
feel like in practice the raising range
is a bit too strong
so I would if I want to raise I would
need a bit more of a stronger hand let's
say four seven four five I could be
blocking like some of the value
but in theory here people should do
quite a lot of slow playing not race too
many over Bears so when people do race
too much random 8X for example and over
Paris and all that stuff
I think the correct approach is to
first of all fast play a lot of your
value around the flop
and
your Bluffs then should contain a bit
more Equity because you're bluffing into
a stronger range so five dudes I don't
think makes it
but yeah you like donkey donkeys like
this video
if you feel a little bit stuck in your
poker career then
me and Adam we've constructed the most
complete coaching program on the market
the mechanics of Poker coaching program
we're now accepting new students
make applications close somewhere in the
first week of May so depending on when
you see this you can still enter yes or
no
you can apply description down below
will teach you all that good stuff
both from a technical but also from
mentor game
and performance perspective
I think
quite an interesting spot
you should probably use a lot of 5x to
Bluff up
probably even go bigger so he should
probably use a lot of 5x or already
Bluff on the Flop so I'm not really too
worried about that probably this Asia
cupbody would have already batted
somewhere
so I feel like this bet is just free
rolling
defaults an ace it's great
maybe we should bet a little bit bigger
Queen nine three four seven I'll bet
this sent 50 50. hold the check
against small new ones different I think
earlier in the video it was Queen nine
six in the three but
Queen four seven is definitely different
than Queen A3 I know people might
treat it sort of the same I think now we
can probably over bet
I'll call here through the pocket
I think I'm gonna
check behind
with a space we probably just get it in
now on the river
a block is probably the play
in time
now we should definitely bet here it's
if you like gems we just have too much
we have enough activity that we can just
call it off some denial
right
to go with it
definitely not that five five is not
good enough to go with it and then you
definitely don't want to get check
raised
this is going to be interesting if you
raise this
we block a lot of his flushes like
little Queen ax that he could check back
he could definitely Bluff us with a hand
like a stem with a diamond king 10 with
a diamond
what I was saying
like a lot of players only focus maybe
on like the technical aspect but in my
opinion the mental game the performance
aspect is what it's going to determine
how much of that technical knowledge you
can put
on the table
so it's a very important aspect
so
if you like
your book career use a little bit of a
boost
don't hesitate lie down below
me and Adam look for it
coaching you
think
this hand I'm gonna go bad bad
that look on your face when you say that
you want to go back but they actually
make it hand and then you and the side
what's the best option
both
we're gonna go for a check but
nice but
like we we lose some value here versus a
hand like king queen king Jack but it
doesn't really matter
I'm a little bit afraid though to lose
value from an ace
I'm gonna do something really fishy
this hand does quite a lot of dilemmas
his hand is quite up
so
explain
like you lose value from let's say he
has Jacks king queen king Jack that
Queen it's always hands that we're
blocking with King Jack so that's good
River oh
taken out
three for also I'll try this guys
the reason I check Jam the third is
because
like I said we already concluded that
recreationals they forget to value that
so I was afraid that
you would have quite a lot of hands like
a Jack or just an Ace and we'll check
that behind the river
now obviously we then now lose value
from Bluffs
his main Blaster should probably be low
pocket pairs
so then sort of the equation is well how
often do we now
with a gem how often do we now get extra
money out of 10
uh uh an ace obviously for example at 10
there can be some scary cards for him on
the river that he might even check back
at 10 on the river so on one side we
want to slow play the downside obviously
is that he's now going to fall as Bluffs
if he falls a flush draw that's actually
quite okay
uh we had a similar spot earlier with a
pair
I think I would have liked actually
seeing myself call that pair a little
bit earlier
this one is a bit close but I'm gonna go
for
I'm
these type of things if this is for
example a guy you play against a lot and
you see him do this more often it's
quite easy down there he does this too
aggressively there's obviously you're
gonna hear a call more but I think you
can also start checking a little bit
more strong lines on the turn this is a
tech line
some people like to attack
but yeah come back to my king Jack hand
so yeah it has just like any other poker
hand both lines has ups and downs I
think it was a similar spot earlier with
king queen
uh unlike Jack three three four or
something it was I believe First
recreational player that has upsides
check has downsides
I think both options are fine
so
wrapping up another
plane explain another poke instructional
videos if we're closing up another poker
instructional video like you've seen
many who say it can go either way
yeah well some things can go either way
other things can't again it's from me
