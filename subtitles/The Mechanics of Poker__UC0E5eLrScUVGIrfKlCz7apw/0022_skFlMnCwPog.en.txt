and basically on the river
we jam it in using the blockers also and
i went for a
250-ish percent
over bat and decided to go for a big
over bat and we decided to
throw our stacking blocking so again
it's a similar situation where we should
just go
very big

hello my poker friends and welcome back
to
another video here on the poker ambition
channel
in which today we are going to be
looking at triple
barrel handy series i went through my
beta base and selected a couple of
triple barrel spots that i wanted to
share with you guys
spoiler alert we are often going to make
some very big bets with
not the strongest holdings so let's hope
they fault
if you want to know a little bit more
about the theory behind bluffing i
did make a theoretical video earlier in
this channel
so go check it out if you haven't seen
that one also
if you did like the way i made my
riverbats
please give this video a thumbs up and
also subscribe to the channel as we will
be leaving way more content very soon
and without further ado let's get into
the first
hand we face a button open we're in a
smaller
pocket tents and we three bet we see a
flop of king jack seven and we decide to
go for a little
but the idea behind this is that if we
three bat linear range from the small
blind
boards like this hit us pretty well and
we could kind of simplify our strategy
by betting a lot for a very small sizing
it is a two-tone board so in general
it's probably a good idea to do
implement some checks if i had for
example tens without a club maybe that's
a good candidate for a check but i think
tens with a club
plays fine as a bet as there could
be some potentials on later streets
spoiler alert since the turn is now a
queen finland calls
and we decide to use our tent as a
barrel
now the idea behind this is pretty
simple
uh if you look at the nuts or the nuts
is 910 or 8
10 and we have 2 10 so it's way less
likely that villain has the nuts so in
general
you could say that his fault equity goes
up given the cards that we have
if we check most likely if he bats we do
have quite a high equity hand
i think we should probably continue
never going to continue anyways i
would probably prefer to use the bedding
line as
we could get bluff some of the time and
i don't think we can just simply call
down
in our blockers so i think the the
barrel is good
imposition calls and basically on the
river
we jam it in using the blockers also
think it's hard for us here
to show up with a lot of natural bluffs
i think probably
good bluffing candidates would be a hand
like ace acts of spades or ace acts and
hearts
those would be kind of the more the most
intuitive
beloveds i would say if we have let's
say for example asexual clubs it's
usually
not not the preferred bluff as we are
blocking hands that villain is folding
um so i think overall it's gonna be
quite hard for villain to call
down unless he has like a hand that
beats my value range which is probably
maybe the the tina's hand would be asus
i guess
he calls unfortunately he does show up
with the k9
which is a hand that doesn't beat any
value
you could even say that it kind of
blocks some of my bluffs
as nines with a club for example would
be a hand that i could play in a similar
fashion um so yeah
i'm not really sure what i think about
this call like i said i think it is a
tough spot for the small one to be over
bluffing i mean he does block
uh the the 910 he blocks some good hands
in king queen king jack type of holding
so it's kind of whatever
but i definitely do like my bluff
moving on to the next hand we have 7 10
suited on the button
we open poker glucan the small man falls
master dog
defends the big blind we see a flop of
king 5 8
king high rainbow flop usually favors
the button so i'm going to be doing
quite a lot of wanted seabedding
measure dog does coal turn his jack he
checks
and now on the turn i think it's a spot
that we're not gonna have the highest
seabed frequency
as we already see that quite a big
portion of her range on the flop
measuredok has folded most of his air so
he
showed that he has the interest in the
pot usually leading to
betting a little bit less with a bigger
sizing
i went for a three quarters here instead
of an over bed i think over bed is
definitely the
the biggest chunk of sizing that we will
use here on the turn
however i do think there are some hands
that could benefit from a three-quarter
and in general i'm not a big fan of
using terms like oh i always bet one
turret here or i do ranges range that
yes on the turn the majority of your
bets will be over bets but i definitely
think there's benefits
in always at least considering a split
so i will split here between the three
quarters and
over bat and certain hands will benefit
from that i don't have a great draw i
mean it's only a gutter so i think this
hand is
fine in a smaller sizing
mr sherdock calls and on the river
there's an ace
and he checks and now we have to
consider what to do
and i went for a 250ish percent
over bat and the idea behind this is
quite simple
uh take the nuts again like hand like
queen 10
for what it's worth we block it a little
bit if you did float queen 10
spades on the flop and if you didn't
three bet that pre-flop
so quinten diamonds i think is less
likely could check raise a turn
um and in general i don't think he has
queen 10 off suit here on the river
and we can definitely have queen 10 off
suit so it gives us a certain range
advantage
and usually how you capitalize on a
certain capped range from
your opponent and an uncapped not
advantage range for
the for us the hero you should usually
just size really big you can even make
uh argument for just shipping my stack
in i think that is definitely a valid
option
so you could almost say that i kind of
made a mistake here by not going even
bigger
um but i think it's kind of whatever i
think
not betting is a big mistake betting
three quarters is a mistake
uh and then at least going 150 plus
i think is just in general a very good
strategy in this kind of situations
okay he faults
okay which is finally a good result as
the last
time we kind of bluffed off a stack this
is kind of the thing with bluffing right
the times that you get called you lose a
stack and times that you don't get
called you win
511 dollars so it has to work quite
often
next hand we
have a certain similar situation we're
up against the sure dock again we open
the queen 10 on the button he calls
flop comes a75 let's support that we
shouldn't be see betting actually at a
too high of a frequency it's an
often oversee that board i just did
decide to see that with the queen 10
which
i don't think we should do all of the
time but it's fine
turn is a king and again it's a sort of
a similar spot as the previous hands
where i think the majority of my bets
here should be over bats
and probably to be honest in this exact
spot maybe over but
only could make sense but again there
are some circumstances where you would
want to size down
i went for three quarters which in this
case i do actually think is a mistake i
think over bed here is definitely better
and make sure that calls and the river
is a queen
and now we do have some showdown value
as we did here the queen
the queen is not a club so he could have
maybe floated they had like queen nine
of clubs that would win against he could
have
seven ex clubs that were winning against
but i think the majority of his range is
probably going to be a king
or an ace and we get a kind of similar
spot as earlier where
it's very unlikely that our opponent has
none nuts and it's very likely that we
have the nuts as
jack 10 it could definitely be in our c
betting range i think that's one of the
candidates that i would always see that
as it can turn some good gutters like
basically an
eight or higher gives me a gutter or a
pair a
little unlike queen 10 which on an eight
or nine doesn't improve to a gutter
that's why i think queen 10
it's probably a better check on the flop
than a hand like 10 jack for example
and on the river here we're kind of
using our
our blockers you could say i think king
10 for example could actually be a
potential hero call of him ace 10 is
definitely a good hint
for him to call and we're blocking some
absolute strong hands in king queen and
queen
seven and ace queen if he did call that
some of the time
so again it's a similar situation where
we should just go very big
okay and give him a lot of headaches
and he did in default again which is
going to happen quite often guys because
full percentages in this kind of
scenarios are gonna be really high
we're over betting the run it is quite
favorable for us
um so yeah if you're out of position
there's not much
you can do and again i think it's hard
for us to be bluffing as we have to be
turning certain hands like
this type of holdings into a bluff
around the turn we have to be barreling
hands like
jack eight which are basically nothing
next hand fellow poker ambition
master explode opens the button we're
not afraid we three bet the h3 suited
as it looks quite pretty he calls
flop389
uh we can play this in multiple ways i
decided to
start off with a one third c bet with my
three and kind of go from there
um definitely could be arguments made on
this flop for
a split betting strategy
h3 with hearts h3 of clubs for example i
don't mind betting big but i think
history of hearts with some extra
potential basically you don't really
mind playing
later streets as we will often turn more
equity
export calls and now on the turn it's
quite interesting what to do
basically if we check any bets i think
we always have a fault uh
and i actually decided to go for a
barrel
which i do actually like uh
the showdown value yes we do have made
him but showdown value in this spot
is quite terrible um you could even make
an argument that we sometimes get called
by worse mainly i think ace 10 h jack
type of holdings could cause on the turn
he could fold better like fours fives
so overall i think it's just a fine play
comparing the effects of jack and bats i
think
betting is fine he calls and on the
river there's a
10 and i think this is a spot that
people
often kind of choke us i mean
the impositions perceived range has
quite a lot of jackax
it's quite a lot of two pairs but
actually did decide to go for it i mean
we're
still blocking pocket threes which
obviously
you could almost say it's a bluff
catcher but
i mean three web pods people find it
hard to fold sets
we do block the ace jack if he had like
a jack of hearts that he would have
played that way so our blockers sort of
count
we don't really block a lot of hands
that could fault maybe you could make
argument that we're blocking ace queen
which is not very favorable
but i think again if we use kind of
psychology from the buttons perspective
uh i don't really have much natural
bluffs again
as i think i would have to be turning a
10 into a bluff like i had like king 10
ace 10 would then be my primary
sort of good bluffing candidates i guess
and actually remember he thought about
for quite quite some time he did end up
calling with the 910
um which i mean
again it's he
the hands the hands that you decide to
call here with i don't think are as
important as
just putting your opponent on a hand
that could bluff and seeing if he's
capable of bluffing
which he did give me the credit to show
up with bluffs in this scenario so
shout out to the explode and
we unfortunately lost another stack but
again i do think
i like the way i played this hand
especially because i kind of know
how my opponent thinks and i was kind of
trying to take advantage of that
but he some people are just too good to
bluff and they out level you
10-4 and now you might be saying hey are
we going to raise the 10-4 no this is
actually a triple-barrel spot where
we got limped in by the small blind
he decides to check the flop which i
think he should do at a very high
frequency we're quite deep
and the board has an advantage for the
imposition as we will be having five
dissolve five three off four six off
that holdings most of the time we could
sometimes also raise some of these
holdings pre-flop
but in general i think uh also we have a
forex
cisco 6x advantage so starting with a
lot of checking from the x cooler man's
position i think is good
therefore we should probably do a lot of
betting and he should just be a lot of
do a lot of folding that's kind of the
nature of the spot
he not indeed check also he has shown
that he has some interest
the turn i think a three actually
improves
us quite well as i think we're gonna be
betting a lot of threes
already in the flop as there are some
values less protection considerations
and we kind of
we can bet a lot of 3x because we have
such an advantage on the sport
so i decided to follow up my aggression
uh decided to go forward this
is like 150 pot he did
decide to call which i think he could
still do with
hands that will have trouble folding the
trouble on the river
mainly still having some ace highs a
hand with a six in it like a king six
which does have some showdown value
given how ranges look
in a limp pod and on the river as a king
now obviously
now um we don't know where to bring from
king six
or ace king and also if you look at now
at our value betting range basically
we're not batting a five anymore which
we could definitely still be betting on
the turn
um basically we're saying we have a
three or better
and i think this is all always a good
idea when you
try to con try to figure out which side
you're going to bet
is kind of figure out how thin you're
going uh how much blood
possible bluffs you have and then kind
of go bigger
bigger accordingly so in this case yeah
we're gonna bet a three
or a three or better
we do have quite a lot of potential
bluffs so i did decide to go for a big
overbet
i think actually in hindsight i think we
should probably even go a little bit
bigger
given the nature of the spot
but i did i would say i did do my best
to make him fault
but i would have liked to see us go a
little bit bigger
and he did sniff out the bluff
to be fair he did have a blocker to a
full house
if he has a four or a six that kind of
goes either way yes he's blocking a
straight but he's also blocking my most
likely bluffs
um i mean he has three pair in general
three powers good call or race
on rivers so can't blame him we tried
didn't didn't work but i don't think i'm
really aiming
a hand like king deuce to fault
so i still like my play but i do think
going a little bit bigger
would have maybe gotten the job done
here we face open on the button the
three from the small blind i decided to
go for a cold format with the ace queen
so far pretty standard
god of heads up that sides to coal flop
is 886 which i think in general
um yeah we kind of have knights plus
and he doesn't so huge a huge advantage
he does have some 8x advantage i would
say like it's more likely that he has an
end like eight seven suited than us or
sixes or eights
but i think overall this is just a very
good board for us so we see that he
calls
turn as a king which is a very good turn
i think we can basically barrel
sort of range as uh nine stands jacks et
cetera they all benefit
from some protection and can get some
value so i think barreling sort of range
for a small sizing here is pretty good
um we do have the asia diamonds which in
general if you have
if you have the ace of diamonds and
there's two diamonds on the board
you already know if you look ahead that
if another diamond is coming in we kind
of have to not bluff
and actually another diamond did come in
he called twice and we decided to
throw our stacking blocking aces
blocking ace queen and diamonds ace
jacket
diamonds ace 10 of diamonds type of
holdings i think he's gonna have a very
hard time with his hands like nines
tents
um sevens five six five suited type of
holdings
so i definitely like my bluff here and
actually unlike the other bluffs in this
case we're risking
uh 5.7 k for 3.5 so it has to work less
often so i definitely think this is a
good
bluff we did however get snapped off
and he did have the aces he did trap us
and he wins a nice 12.8 k
pot unlucky for us
but i do like my triple and i think the
main uh
main takeaway from did this is that
a head like this is definitely a good
hand to double barrel to triple on
a diamond run out
you
