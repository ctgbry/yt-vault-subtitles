[07:26]
get into it. You excited, Dan? You

[07:26]
get into it. You excited, Dan? You
curious?

&gt;&gt; Buzzing, mate. Let's go.

[07:29]
&gt;&gt; Buzzing, mate. Let's go.

[07:29]
&gt;&gt; Buzzing, mate. Let's go.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, we start at the start,

[07:32]
&gt;&gt; All right. So, we start at the start,

[07:32]
&gt;&gt; All right. So, we start at the start,
uh, the general overview where we just

[07:34]
uh, the general overview where we just

[07:34]
uh, the general overview where we just
see your win rate. Uh also based on 700,

[07:37]
see your win rate. Uh also based on 700,

[07:37]
see your win rate. Uh also based on 700,
5 to 600 3 to 400, we see that you've

[07:39]
5 to 600 3 to 400, we see that you've

[07:39]
5 to 600 3 to 400, we see that you've
done a decent amount of battles, doing

[07:41]
done a decent amount of battles, doing

[07:41]
done a decent amount of battles, doing
well there. Uh this brown number that

[07:43]
well there. Uh this brown number that

[07:43]
well there. Uh this brown number that
you see is the average number of

[07:45]
you see is the average number of

[07:45]
you see is the average number of
population. So on average, the

[07:46]
population. So on average, the

[07:46]
population. So on average, the
population loses when they're uh rack

[07:49]
population loses when they're uh rack

[07:49]
population loses when they're uh rack

This is actually something that's very

[07:52]
This is actually something that's very

[07:52]
This is actually something that's very
present in my game usually as well. It's

[07:54]
present in my game usually as well. It's

[07:54]
present in my game usually as well. It's
just when I battle, I'm way more

[07:55]
just when I battle, I'm way more

[07:56]
just when I battle, I'm way more
engaged, way more focused, uh and I

[07:58]
engaged, way more focused, uh and I

[07:58]
engaged, way more focused, uh and I
usually play well. So it's not

[07:59]
usually play well. So it's not

[07:59]
usually play well. So it's not
necessarily that my opponents are worse,

[08:01]
necessarily that my opponents are worse,

[08:01]
necessarily that my opponents are worse,
they're actually better, but I play

[08:03]
they're actually better, but I play

[08:03]
they're actually better, but I play
better as well. It's actually something

[08:04]
better as well. It's actually something

[08:04]
better as well. It's actually something
that I explain in the program as well

[08:06]
that I explain in the program as well

[08:06]
that I explain in the program as well
that u you know the reason why you might

[08:10]
that u you know the reason why you might

[08:10]
that u you know the reason why you might
do something is might not even be a

[08:12]
do something is might not even be a

[08:12]
do something is might not even be a
technical mistake. It might be a focus

[08:13]
technical mistake. It might be a focus

[08:13]
technical mistake. It might be a focus
and engagement mistake right and that's

[08:15]
and engagement mistake right and that's

[08:15]
and engagement mistake right and that's
why it's very important to diagnose

[08:16]
why it's very important to diagnose

[08:16]
why it's very important to diagnose
correctly. So if we look at this tab

[08:18]
correctly. So if we look at this tab

[08:18]
correctly. So if we look at this tab
this is just very basic some win rates.

[08:19]
this is just very basic some win rates.

[08:19]
this is just very basic some win rates.
The first thing that I noticed actually

[08:22]
The first thing that I noticed actually

[08:22]
The first thing that I noticed actually
in your game is this one. If we look at

[08:25]
in your game is this one. If we look at

[08:25]
in your game is this one. If we look at
the win rates per position I think we're

[08:28]
the win rates per position I think we're

[08:28]
the win rates per position I think we're
working with like 150k hands right yeah

[08:30]
working with like 150k hands right yeah

[08:30]
working with like 150k hands right yeah
here on the right top 150k hands. This

[08:32]
here on the right top 150k hands. This

[08:32]
here on the right top 150k hands. This
is the this is your win rate. This is

[08:34]
is the this is your win rate. This is

[08:34]
is the this is your win rate. This is
the win rate of bots. Now take in

[08:36]
the win rate of bots. Now take in

[08:36]
the win rate of bots. Now take in
consideration these bots, you know, they

[08:38]
consideration these bots, you know, they

[08:38]
consideration these bots, you know, they
have a win rate of zero in the end,

[08:39]
have a win rate of zero in the end,

[08:40]
have a win rate of zero in the end,
right? Because they're playing against

[08:40]
right? Because they're playing against

[08:40]
right? Because they're playing against
bots and they don't pay any rake. So

[08:43]
bots and they don't pay any rake. So

[08:43]
bots and they don't pay any rake. So
ideally, we would outperform the bots,

[08:45]
ideally, we would outperform the bots,

[08:45]
ideally, we would outperform the bots,
right? Um and the win rates behind that

[08:48]
right? Um and the win rates behind that

[08:48]
right? Um and the win rates behind that
are the win rates of an average

[08:50]
are the win rates of an average

[08:50]
are the win rates of an average
population. So obviously we would like

[08:52]
population. So obviously we would like

[08:52]
population. So obviously we would like
that's kind of more of maybe a real

[08:54]
that's kind of more of maybe a real

[08:54]
that's kind of more of maybe a real

human being playing in these games? And

[09:00]
human being playing in these games? And

[09:00]
human being playing in these games? And
then the one thing that I straight away

[09:02]
then the one thing that I straight away

[09:02]
then the one thing that I straight away
noticed was the big blind minus 88 minus

[09:05]
noticed was the big blind minus 88 minus

[09:05]
noticed was the big blind minus 88 minus
848.

[09:06]
848.

848.
Uh on the other in the other areas, you

[09:08]
Uh on the other in the other areas, you

[09:08]
Uh on the other in the other areas, you
know, you perform the same or even

[09:10]
know, you perform the same or even

[09:10]
know, you perform the same or even
better. So like EPMP cut off, it's

[09:12]
better. So like EPMP cut off, it's

[09:12]
better. So like EPMP cut off, it's
mainly in the blinds where at first

[09:14]
mainly in the blinds where at first

[09:14]
mainly in the blinds where at first
glance, right, if you if we just look

[09:16]
glance, right, if you if we just look

[09:16]
glance, right, if you if we just look
purely at the win rate, uh that's kind

[09:18]
purely at the win rate, uh that's kind

[09:18]
purely at the win rate, uh that's kind
of where there's room for improvement.

[09:20]
of where there's room for improvement.

[09:20]
of where there's room for improvement.
Now this is very important uh when you

[09:22]
Now this is very important uh when you

[09:22]
Now this is very important uh when you
do database analysis that you don't go

[09:24]
do database analysis that you don't go

do database analysis that you don't go
blind on one stat. Now some people might

That's usually how I how I like to do

[09:33]
That's usually how I how I like to do

[09:33]
That's usually how I how I like to do
database reviews. This is something that

database reviews. This is something that
I will now note down. Okay. At at the

I will now note down. Okay. At at the
first layer that we start gathering

[09:39]
first layer that we start gathering

[09:39]
first layer that we start gathering
information about your game. We've

[09:40]
information about your game. We've

information about your game. We've
identified that your big blend rim rate

[09:42]
identified that your big blend rim rate

[09:42]
identified that your big blend rim rate
is quite low. Okay. Let's keep that in

[09:43]
is quite low. Okay. Let's keep that in

[09:43]
is quite low. Okay. Let's keep that in
mind. Let's note that somewhere and

we go through the tabs that this this
point will ever time come back. And this

[09:54]

point will ever time come back. And this
is very important to help identify where

[09:57]
is very important to help identify where

[09:57]
is very important to help identify where
exactly something is going wrong. Right?

[09:59]
exactly something is going wrong. Right?

exactly something is going wrong. Right?
So for now, that's basically the most

important thing that I want to get from
this tab. Like I said, you can just get

this tab. Like I said, you can just get
some general information, win rate

[10:07]
some general information, win rate

[10:07]
some general information, win rate
information. Obviously, you need huge

is is is not really going to say much

[10:35]
is is is not really going to say much

[10:35]
is is is not really going to say much
here. We can do see like versus the

[10:37]
here. We can do see like versus the

[10:37]
here. We can do see like versus the
open. So let's say you're in the big

[10:38]
open. So let's say you're in the big

[10:38]
open. So let's say you're in the big
blind and you face an open we see that

[10:40]
blind and you face an open we see that

[10:40]
blind and you face an open we see that
when you call you lose twice as what

[10:43]
when you call you lose twice as what

[10:43]
when you call you lose twice as what
you're supposed to lose. So based on

[10:45]
you're supposed to lose. So based on

[10:45]
you're supposed to lose. So based on
just this sheet, we could say that okay,

[10:47]
just this sheet, we could say that okay,

[10:47]
just this sheet, we could say that okay,
defending from the big blind is probably

that's false or we have to re uh um kind
of retest this observation. So if we can

then go to the next tab, sub games,

[11:07]
then go to the next tab, sub games,

[11:07]
then go to the next tab, sub games,
there we can just see your win rates

[11:09]
there we can just see your win rates

[11:09]
there we can just see your win rates
across all um all spots. And if we

[11:13]
across all um all spots. And if we

blind defense we can indeed see you're

[11:19]
blind defense we can indeed see you're

[11:19]
blind defense we can indeed see you're
winning at minus or you're losing at

[11:21]
winning at minus or you're losing at

[11:21]
winning at minus or you're losing at
minus 108 whereas GTO would be minus 45.

[11:24]
minus 108 whereas GTO would be minus 45.

[11:24]
minus 108 whereas GTO would be minus 45.
But obviously they pay no rake right if

[11:27]
But obviously they pay no rake right if

[11:27]
But obviously they pay no rake right if
you defend in the big blind you will pay

[11:28]
you defend in the big blind you will pay

[11:28]
you defend in the big blind you will pay
some rake and population is minus 58. So

[11:31]
some rake and population is minus 58. So

[11:31]
some rake and population is minus 58. So
this is definitely an area of attention

where you should be -5 or - 44. So this

[11:41]
where you should be -5 or - 44. So this

[11:41]
where you should be -5 or - 44. So this
kind of confirms again that the big

[11:42]
kind of confirms again that the big

[11:42]
kind of confirms again that the big

all win rate I can tell you it's usually

all win rate I can tell you it's usually
3x of what it's supposed to be. So all

3x of what it's supposed to be. So all
the biggest winners over a small sample

the biggest winners over a small sample
usually run very well in pre flop or

almost all your winnings in poker come
from ace king plus and queens plus. It's

then how often if you have tens to kings

[17:07]
then how often if you have tens to kings

[17:07]
then how often if you have tens to kings
how often you actually flop an over

[17:08]
how often you actually flop an over

[17:08]
how often you actually flop an over
pair. This is actually especially in a

[17:09]
pair. This is actually especially in a

[17:09]
pair. This is actually especially in a
short term it's a huge indicator of

[17:11]
short term it's a huge indicator of

[17:11]
short term it's a huge indicator of
variance. Let's say you three pocket

[17:12]
variance. Let's say you three pocket

[17:12]
variance. Let's say you three pocket
queens three times in a row and every

[17:14]
queens three times in a row and every

[17:14]
queens three times in a row and every
time the flop is ace high that's that's

[17:16]
time the flop is ace high that's that's

[17:16]
time the flop is ace high that's that's
going to hurt your or hurt your win rate

[17:18]
going to hurt your or hurt your win rate

[17:18]
going to hurt your or hurt your win rate
over a short sample. Whereas if every

[17:19]
over a short sample. Whereas if every

[17:19]
over a short sample. Whereas if every
time the flop was 10i, man, you might

[17:21]
time the flop was 10i, man, you might

[17:21]
time the flop was 10i, man, you might
you might win three stacks more over a

[17:23]
you might win three stacks more over a

[17:23]
you might win three stacks more over a
10k hand sample, right? So that's

[17:25]
10k hand sample, right? So that's

[17:25]
10k hand sample, right? So that's
actually a huge indicator of variance.

[17:26]
actually a huge indicator of variance.

[17:26]
actually a huge indicator of variance.
And for you actually, we can see that

[17:28]
And for you actually, we can see that

[17:28]
And for you actually, we can see that
you're supposed to flop an over pair

[17:30]
you're supposed to flop an over pair

[17:30]
you're supposed to flop an over pair
with this hand around 50% of the time.

[17:31]
with this hand around 50% of the time.

[17:31]
with this hand around 50% of the time.
You're only at 44k. So a bit you saw an

[17:34]
You're only at 44k. So a bit you saw an

[17:34]
You're only at 44k. So a bit you saw an
overcard a bit more often in three and

[17:36]
overcard a bit more often in three and

[17:36]
overcard a bit more often in three and
four pots. Uh you're also your win rate

[17:38]
four pots. Uh you're also your win rate

[17:38]
four pots. Uh you're also your win rate
is way lower. Your $1 showdown is way

[17:41]
is way lower. Your $1 showdown is way

[17:41]
is way lower. Your $1 showdown is way
lower. Uh which means uh that again when

[17:44]
lower. Uh which means uh that again when

[17:44]
lower. Uh which means uh that again when
the when the cards went open, you lost.

[17:46]
the when the cards went open, you lost.

[17:46]
the when the cards went open, you lost.
So probably you got cooler here. And

[17:48]
So probably you got cooler here. And

[17:48]
So probably you got cooler here. And
then on the turn, how often how often it

[17:50]
then on the turn, how often how often it

[17:50]
then on the turn, how often how often it
remained an over pair, way less as well.

[17:53]
remained an over pair, way less as well.

[17:53]
remained an over pair, way less as well.
43% instead of 56%. So you were not able

[17:55]
43% instead of 56%. So you were not able

[17:56]
43% instead of 56%. So you were not able
to and that's also probably where this

Um, so this is a great indicator of

[18:06]
Um, so this is a great indicator of

[18:06]
Um, so this is a great indicator of
variance. You run quite bad in three and

[18:08]
variance. You run quite bad in three and

[18:08]
variance. You run quite bad in three and
four by pot over pairs. So uh, if you

[18:11]
four by pot over pairs. So uh, if you

[18:11]
four by pot over pairs. So uh, if you
now you really have something to

&gt;&gt; Yeah, know it's it's it's cool to see.

feel like we're running bad, you know,

[18:35]
feel like we're running bad, you know,

feel like we're running bad, you know,
to a certain degree. But um and you know

when I think back over over this year

[18:40]
when I think back over over this year

[18:40]
when I think back over over this year
there's there's been periods up and down

[18:42]
there's there's been periods up and down

there's there's been periods up and down

variance comes from and uh yeah I think

[18:55]
variance comes from and uh yeah I think

variance comes from and uh yeah I think
about you know there was

about you know there was

about you know there was

[18:59]
&gt;&gt; a period June July where I was doing

&gt;&gt; a period June July where I was doing
quite well and then August where I got

[19:01]

July I think I was quite under EV and In

July I think I was quite under EV and In
August, I was actually over EV despite

[19:08]
August, I was actually over EV despite

[19:08]
August, I was actually over EV despite
getting destroyed. So, I would guess I'd

[19:10]
getting destroyed. So, I would guess I'd

[19:10]

actually it can also uh really work. So

actually it can also uh really work. So

actually it can also uh really work. So
yeah that's kind of it for like the

the other two overview tabs which you

the other two overview tabs which you

the other two overview tabs which you
could see more as like a hut, right?

[21:05]
could see more as like a hut, right?

[21:05]
could see more as like a hut, right?
just a very broad overview of your game

[21:08]
just a very broad overview of your game

[21:08]
just a very broad overview of your game
and then mainly around as you can see

[21:10]
and then mainly around as you can see

[21:10]
and then mainly around as you can see
here the range construction and like

[21:12]
here the range construction and like

[21:12]
here the range construction and like
sebat versus seb. So basically mainly

[21:14]
sebat versus seb. So basically mainly

[21:14]
sebat versus seb. So basically mainly
how you construct your ranges um from

[21:17]
how you construct your ranges um from

[21:17]
how you construct your ranges um from
like the the most global perspective we

[21:20]
like the the most global perspective we

[21:20]
like the the most global perspective we
can look at it right from from the top

[21:22]
can look at it right from from the top

[21:22]
can look at it right from from the top
down. So the first thing that I noticed

[21:24]
down. So the first thing that I noticed

[21:24]
down. So the first thing that I noticed
uh when I was looking at this tab is 541

[21:27]
uh when I was looking at this tab is 541

[21:27]
uh when I was looking at this tab is 541
was a flop. So, you're definitely

[21:29]
was a flop. So, you're definitely

[21:29]
was a flop. So, you're definitely
fighting. But if we then looked at your

[21:31]
fighting. But if we then looked at your

[21:31]
fighting. But if we then looked at your
um at your red line and blue line, like

[21:34]
um at your red line and blue line, like

[21:34]
um at your red line and blue line, like
your red line was not necessarily going

[21:36]
your red line was not necessarily going

[21:36]
your red line was not necessarily going
through the roof, which people would

[21:37]
through the roof, which people would

[21:37]
through the roof, which people would
often associate with 541s of flop,

[21:39]
often associate with 541s of flop,

[21:39]
often associate with 541s of flop,
right? So, that's something to pay

[21:40]
right? So, that's something to pay

[21:40]
right? So, that's something to pay
attention to. Uh and then if your red

[21:43]
attention to. Uh and then if your red

[21:43]
attention to. Uh and then if your red
line is not going high, you know, your

[21:44]
line is not going high, you know, your

[21:44]
line is not going high, you know, your
blue line should make up for it. And but

[21:46]
blue line should make up for it. And but

[21:46]
blue line should make up for it. And but
that was actually also stagnating. So,

[21:47]
that was actually also stagnating. So,

[21:48]
that was actually also stagnating. So,
you didn't have like some players have

[21:49]
you didn't have like some players have

[21:49]
you didn't have like some players have
like a clear blue line or clear red line

[21:51]
like a clear blue line or clear red line

[21:51]
like a clear blue line or clear red line
problem with you. That was not really

[21:53]
problem with you. That was not really

[21:53]
problem with you. That was not really
the case because both lines they kind of

[21:55]
the case because both lines they kind of

[21:55]
the case because both lines they kind of
ended up breaking even and so you ended

[21:57]
ended up breaking even and so you ended

[21:57]
ended up breaking even and so you ended
up breaking even, right? So it seems to

[22:00]
up breaking even, right? So it seems to

[22:00]
up breaking even, right? So it seems to
be that you might usually this for me is

[22:03]
be that you might usually this for me is

be that you might usually this for me is
an indicator that it's more of a blue

line problem. I think that's where you

[22:06]
line problem. I think that's where you

[22:06]
line problem. I think that's where you
can make uh uh most money uh that you're

[22:10]
can make uh uh most money uh that you're

[22:10]
can make uh uh most money uh that you're
now winning pots especially with your

[22:13]
now winning pots especially with your

now winning pots especially with your
stronger hands that are going to be less

[22:14]
stronger hands that are going to be less

[22:14]
stronger hands that are going to be less
than what they should be. But we will

[22:16]
than what they should be. But we will

than what they should be. But we will
get to that later on as well.

[22:17]
get to that later on as well.

[22:17]
get to that later on as well.
Especially, for example, if you look at

[22:19]
Especially, for example, if you look at

[22:19]
Especially, for example, if you look at
your aggression here on the river,

[22:20]
your aggression here on the river,

[22:20]
your aggression here on the river,
you're in general, you seem to be a

[22:22]
you're in general, you seem to be a

[22:22]
you're in general, you seem to be a
little bit overaggressive. Uh especially

[22:24]
little bit overaggressive. Uh especially

[22:24]
little bit overaggressive. Uh especially
on the river, that means that you're not

[22:27]
on the river, that means that you're not

[22:27]
on the river, that means that you're not
uh trapping enough, which is actually

[22:29]
uh trapping enough, which is actually

[22:29]
uh trapping enough, which is actually
going to be something that I want to

[22:30]
going to be something that I want to

[22:30]
going to be something that I want to
dive into. So, if we now look at uh your

[22:32]
dive into. So, if we now look at uh your

[22:32]
dive into. So, if we now look at uh your
range construction

[22:35]
range construction

[22:35]
range construction
uh on flop actually looks pretty well in

[22:37]
uh on flop actually looks pretty well in

[22:37]
uh on flop actually looks pretty well in
terms of how often you bet with strong,

[22:39]
terms of how often you bet with strong,

[22:39]
terms of how often you bet with strong,
how often you uh bet with weak. So, this

[22:42]
how often you uh bet with weak. So, this

[22:42]
how often you uh bet with weak. So, this
is kind of just flop CBAT or flop

[22:44]
is kind of just flop CBAT or flop

[22:44]
is kind of just flop CBAT or flop

will I will get to that in a second. If
you see things coloring green that means

[22:54]
you see things coloring green that means

[22:54]
you see things coloring green that means
that you're more on the passive side. If

[22:56]
that you're more on the passive side. If

[22:56]
that you're more on the passive side. If
it turns red you're more on the

[22:57]
it turns red you're more on the

[22:57]
it turns red you're more on the

the reason I use green kind of comes

[23:02]
the reason I use green kind of comes

[23:02]
the reason I use green kind of comes
from my philosophy that I usually use

[23:04]
from my philosophy that I usually use

[23:04]
from my philosophy that I usually use
this in a hut and I also always saw

[23:06]
this in a hut and I also always saw

[23:06]
this in a hut and I also always saw
green as this gives you the green light

[23:07]
green as this gives you the green light

[23:07]
green as this gives you the green light
or this gives me the green light. And

[23:09]
or this gives me the green light. And

[23:09]
or this gives me the green light. And
also I know that many many players might

[23:12]
also I know that many many players might

[23:12]
also I know that many many players might
use blue. it's also perfectly fine. But

[23:14]
use blue. it's also perfectly fine. But

[23:14]
use blue. it's also perfectly fine. But
that would say that blue line is

[23:16]
that would say that blue line is

[23:16]
that would say that blue line is
associated with passive play and red

[23:17]
associated with passive play and red

[23:18]
associated with passive play and red
line is associated with with aggressive

[23:19]
line is associated with with aggressive

[23:19]
line is associated with with aggressive
play. And that I just don't think is

[23:21]
play. And that I just don't think is

[23:21]
play. And that I just don't think is
true as just to say, you know, in

[23:23]
true as just to say, you know, in

[23:23]
true as just to say, you know, in
certain areas that's true, but I don't

[23:25]
certain areas that's true, but I don't

[23:25]
certain areas that's true, but I don't
think as a whole that's true. For

[23:26]
think as a whole that's true. For

[23:26]
think as a whole that's true. For
example, you're super aggressive, but

[23:27]
example, you're super aggressive, but

[23:27]
example, you're super aggressive, but
you are not winning at red line, right?

[23:29]
you are not winning at red line, right?

[23:30]
you are not winning at red line, right?
So if that statement would be true

[23:31]
So if that statement would be true

[23:31]
So if that statement would be true
alone, uh then you your red line should

[23:34]
alone, uh then you your red line should

[23:34]
alone, uh then you your red line should
go to the roof. My legend should also go

[23:35]
go to the roof. My legend should also go

[23:35]
go to the roof. My legend should also go
to the roof, but it doesn't. Um,

[23:38]
to the roof, but it doesn't. Um,

[23:38]
to the roof, but it doesn't. Um,
something else I want to focus on

[23:39]
something else I want to focus on

[23:39]
something else I want to focus on
quickly on the flop before we go to the

[23:41]
quickly on the flop before we go to the

[23:41]
quickly on the flop before we go to the
turn. I will pick something from the

[23:42]
turn. I will pick something from the

[23:42]
turn. I will pick something from the
flop. Some turns on the river is your

[23:45]
flop. Some turns on the river is your

[23:45]
flop. Some turns on the river is your
range construction in raising. If we can

[23:48]
range construction in raising. If we can

[23:48]
range construction in raising. If we can
look at your flop range, uh, flop race

[23:50]
look at your flop range, uh, flop race

[23:50]
look at your flop range, uh, flop race
range, it's 50% strong where it should

[23:52]
range, it's 50% strong where it should

[23:52]
range, it's 50% strong where it should
be only 36% strong and it should be 57%

[23:56]
be only 36% strong and it should be 57%

[23:56]
be only 36% strong and it should be 57%
weak and you are only 47% weak. So, that

[23:58]

you're going to get overfold. So

you're going to get overfold. So

actually doing the opposite. So you

[26:57]
actually want to check race way more air

And I would say that you could probably
even find some more folds versus bigger

[29:49]
even find some more folds versus bigger

[29:49]
even find some more folds versus bigger
sebat sizings. Actually, this is

[29:51]
sebat sizings. Actually, this is

[29:51]
sebat sizings. Actually, this is
something that we can actually see here

[29:52]
something that we can actually see here

[29:52]
something that we can actually see here
at uh at our flop defense. Just in

[29:55]
at uh at our flop defense. Just in

[29:55]
at uh at our flop defense. Just in
general overview. Um

[30:00]
we can see here

[30:03]
we can see here

[30:03]
we can see here
how often you face a certain sizing. Let

[30:05]
how often you face a certain sizing. Let

[30:05]
how often you face a certain sizing. Let
me see if that's a general trend. No.

[30:07]
me see if that's a general trend. No.

[30:07]
me see if that's a general trend. No.
Okay. you do seem to adjust versus uh uh

[30:10]
Okay. you do seem to adjust versus uh uh

[30:10]
Okay. you do seem to adjust versus uh uh
versus bigger sizings but we can see

[30:11]
versus bigger sizings but we can see

[30:11]
versus bigger sizings but we can see
here as well the success percentage from

[30:13]
here as well the success percentage from

[30:13]
here as well the success percentage from
raising versus smaller sizing compared

actually I wanted to add is let's say

for example in terms of the slow playing
let's say we go to three pots uh and we

[30:28]
let's say we go to three pots uh and we

[30:28]
let's say we go to three pots uh and we
look at for example your race strategy

[30:31]

we can see here that for example your

we can see here that for example your
flop race strategy. Where are we here?

[30:40]
flop race strategy. Where are we here?

flop race strategy. Where are we here?
Race. So again, you're raising for

[30:42]
Race. So again, you're raising for

[30:42]
Race. So again, you're raising for
example two pair plus uh double the

[30:45]

example two pair plus uh double the
amount of the time and especially I saw

like some hands here. Let's say you have

[30:51]
like some hands here. Let's say you have

like some hands here. Let's say you have
uh a set let's say let's say for example

[30:55]
uh a set let's say let's say for example

[30:55]
uh a set let's say let's say for example
something like this

[30:59]
like at a low SPR dry board. There's

[31:01]
like at a low SPR dry board. There's

[31:01]
like at a low SPR dry board. There's
just not a lot of reason to start

[31:03]
just not a lot of reason to start

[31:04]
just not a lot of reason to start
raising straight away with strong hands.

[31:05]
raising straight away with strong hands.

[31:05]
raising straight away with strong hands.
So like in single race pots, obviously

[31:08]
So like in single race pots, obviously

[31:08]
So like in single race pots, obviously
we we want a check race to get more

[31:10]
we we want a check race to get more

[31:10]
we we want a check race to get more
money in. Uh but especially in three

[31:12]
money in. Uh but especially in three

[31:12]
money in. Uh but especially in three
pots, there's way less of a need to do a

[31:14]
pots, there's way less of a need to do a

[31:14]
pots, there's way less of a need to do a
lot of fast playing. So that's

[31:16]
lot of fast playing. So that's

[31:16]
lot of fast playing. So that's
definitely something uh a point of

[31:18]
definitely something uh a point of

definitely something uh a point of
attention that I would uh uh same here

Yeah, just just just let him let let him

[31:30]
Yeah, just just just let him let let him

Yeah, just just just let him let let him
do his thing, right? Like especially

do his thing, right? Like especially

do his thing, right? Like especially
when also you're in position so he can

[31:33]
when also you're in position so he can

when also you're in position so he can
just check towards you. you can still

[31:34]
just check towards you. you can still

just check towards you. you can still
build a pot. So that's definitely an

[31:36]
build a pot. So that's definitely an

something along those lines. Um, and I'm

this is maybe not the best example,

[32:23]
this is maybe not the best example,

[32:23]
this is maybe not the best example,
but on boards like this, like very

[32:24]
but on boards like this, like very

[32:24]
but on boards like this, like very
connected boards, for example, a hand

[32:26]
connected boards, for example, a hand

[32:26]
connected boards, for example, a hand
like jack eight or something. Uh, that

[32:29]
like jack eight or something. Uh, that

[32:29]
like jack eight or something. Uh, that
is sort of strong, but it's not really

[32:32]
is sort of strong, but it's not really

[32:32]
is sort of strong, but it's not really
strong, right? So, for example, I would

[32:33]
strong, right? So, for example, I would

[32:33]
strong, right? So, for example, I would
much rather check race queen 10 here or

[32:35]
much rather check race queen 10 here or

[32:35]
much rather check race queen 10 here or
queen nine than a hand like jack eight.

[32:37]
queen nine than a hand like jack eight.

[32:37]
queen nine than a hand like jack eight.
Um, so I don't know if that's the case.

[32:39]
Um, so I don't know if that's the case.

[32:40]
Um, so I don't know if that's the case.
Like, this is just a random hand. I just

[32:41]
Like, this is just a random hand. I just

[32:41]
Like, this is just a random hand. I just
saw the texture. Uh, but then that's

[32:43]
saw the texture. Uh, but then that's

[32:43]
saw the texture. Uh, but then that's
something if the board is either super

dry like the A73i, I wouldn't mind slow

dry like the A73i, I wouldn't mind slow
playing. And I would I wouldn't even

call it slow playing, but it's more that

I wouldn't check raise a a bat to pair

on a very wet board, for example.

[32:57]
on a very wet board, for example.

[32:57]
on a very wet board, for example.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, makes a lot of sense. And yeah,

[32:59]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, makes a lot of sense. And yeah,

[32:59]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, makes a lot of sense. And yeah,
especially on the dry boards where you

[33:00]
especially on the dry boards where you

[33:00]
especially on the dry boards where you
have the set or you have the top two

[33:02]

I'm scared of, right? So,

[33:06]
I'm scared of, right? So,

[33:06]
I'm scared of, right? So,
&gt;&gt; it makes a lot of sense in that

[33:07]
&gt;&gt; it makes a lot of sense in that

[33:07]
&gt;&gt; it makes a lot of sense in that
situation to

&gt;&gt; to go h to go a little bit slower. And
then yeah, this queen jacket example, it

[33:13]
then yeah, this queen jacket example, it

[33:13]
then yeah, this queen jacket example, it
was yeah, your jacket is on a lot of

turns and rivers is going to not be

something that you're going to want to

[33:19]
something that you're going to want to

[33:19]
something that you're going to want to
put your stack in with. So it would make

[33:22]
put your stack in with. So it would make

[33:22]
put your stack in with. So it would make
more sense, you know, maybe raise uh,

[33:25]
more sense, you know, maybe raise uh,

more sense, you know, maybe raise uh,
you know, either like a queen that's got

you know, either like a queen that's got

you know, either like a queen that's got
some like a king queen type of hand

[33:29]
some like a king queen type of hand

[33:29]
some like a king queen type of hand
that's going to perhaps, you know,

[33:32]
that's going to perhaps, you know,

[33:32]
that's going to perhaps, you know,
there's not if the overcard comes, it

[33:33]
there's not if the overcard comes, it

[33:33]
there's not if the overcard comes, it
actually improves the hand or if the 10

[33:35]
actually improves the hand or if the 10

[33:35]
actually improves the hand or if the 10
comes, it gives you a straight draw or

[33:37]
comes, it gives you a straight draw or

[33:37]
comes, it gives you a straight draw or
something like your your equity is a

[33:39]
something like your your equity is a

[33:39]
something like your your equity is a
little bit more robust in that scenario.

[33:41]
little bit more robust in that scenario.

[33:41]
little bit more robust in that scenario.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So it's kind of the relative

[33:42]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So it's kind of the relative

[33:42]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So it's kind of the relative
versus absolute strength that uh you

[33:46]
versus absolute strength that uh you

[33:46]
versus absolute strength that uh you
know if you have the tendency to just

[33:47]
know if you have the tendency to just

[33:47]
know if you have the tendency to just
pass play a lot maybe you kind of

[33:49]
pass play a lot maybe you kind of

[33:49]
pass play a lot maybe you kind of
consider two pair there a strong board a

[33:52]
consider two pair there a strong board a

[33:52]
consider two pair there a strong board a
strong hand. So then if we look at the

[33:54]
strong hand. So then if we look at the

[33:54]
strong hand. So then if we look at the
turn uh there's actually like the turn

[33:57]
turn uh there's actually like the turn

[33:57]
turn uh there's actually like the turn
check the raising game here on the turn

[33:59]
check the raising game here on the turn

[33:59]
check the raising game here on the turn
is actually the same the same point as

[34:01]
is actually the same the same point as

[34:01]
is actually the same the same point as
on the flop. But I made actually wanted

[34:03]
on the flop. But I made actually wanted

[34:03]
on the flop. But I made actually wanted
to now zoom in on the turn. We can see

[34:05]
to now zoom in on the turn. We can see

[34:05]
to now zoom in on the turn. We can see
your betting range is way too strong. So

[34:07]
your betting range is way too strong. So

[34:07]
your betting range is way too strong. So
again, like if you look at how often

[34:08]
again, like if you look at how often

[34:08]
again, like if you look at how often
that's strong, it's 55 instead of 42.

[34:11]
that's strong, it's 55 instead of 42.

[34:11]
that's strong, it's 55 instead of 42.
And how often it's weak, it's only 35

[34:13]
And how often it's weak, it's only 35

[34:13]
And how often it's weak, it's only 35
instead of 50. So you're again missing

[34:16]
instead of 50. So you're again missing

[34:16]
instead of 50. So you're again missing
bluffs on the turn by a lot, 15%, and

[34:18]
bluffs on the turn by a lot, 15%, and

[34:18]
bluffs on the turn by a lot, 15%, and
you're betting way too much strong hands

[34:20]
you're betting way too much strong hands

[34:20]
you're betting way too much strong hands
on the turn. Now again, like the

[34:22]
on the turn. Now again, like the

[34:22]
on the turn. Now again, like the
definition of strong here is important.

[34:26]
definition of strong here is important.

[34:26]
definition of strong here is important.
Um, so let's say for example, we go to

[34:29]
Um, so let's say for example, we go to

[34:29]
Um, so let's say for example, we go to
single race pots in position PFR lines

[34:33]
single race pots in position PFR lines

[34:33]
single race pots in position PFR lines
and we go to turn Cbetting. We see that

[34:35]
and we go to turn Cbetting. We see that

[34:35]
and we go to turn Cbetting. We see that
in general you do little turn C betting

[34:38]
in general you do little turn C betting

[34:38]
in general you do little turn C betting
and there again we can see that two pair

[34:39]
and there again we can see that two pair

[34:39]
and there again we can see that two pair
plus uh but most most importantly and

[34:43]
plus uh but most most importantly and

[34:43]
plus uh but most most importantly and
that's actually the one that I think is

[34:44]
that's actually the one that I think is

[34:44]
that's actually the one that I think is
the leak is top pair over pair so one

[34:47]
the leak is top pair over pair so one

[34:47]
the leak is top pair over pair so one

kind of what's going on right two pair

[35:01]
kind of what's going on right two pair

[35:01]
kind of what's going on right two pair
plus again that could be that uh you're

[35:04]
plus again that could be that uh you're

[35:04]
plus again that could be that uh you're
not really understanding like the

[35:06]
not really understanding like the

[35:06]
not really understanding like the
relative versus absolute hand strength.

[35:07]
relative versus absolute hand strength.

[35:07]
relative versus absolute hand strength.
You're not spotting that. So again like

[35:09]
You're not spotting that. So again like

[35:09]
You're not spotting that. So again like
the queen jack eight that I had like

[35:10]
the queen jack eight that I had like

[35:10]
the queen jack eight that I had like
queen 10 would for example always be a

[35:12]
queen 10 would for example always be a

[35:12]
queen 10 would for example always be a
barrel and I had like jack eight could

[35:13]
barrel and I had like jack eight could

[35:13]
barrel and I had like jack eight could
for example be a check. So that's more

[35:15]
for example be a check. So that's more

[35:15]
for example be a check. So that's more
like what I would say in the two pair

[35:16]
like what I would say in the two pair

[35:16]
like what I would say in the two pair
region. Normally in position in this

spot we don't really do slow playing in

[35:22]
spot we don't really do slow playing in

[35:22]
spot we don't really do slow playing in
terms of actual slow playing. Right? If

[35:24]
terms of actual slow playing. Right? If

[35:24]
terms of actual slow playing. Right? If
we slow play a hand like two pair it's

[35:26]
we slow play a hand like two pair it's

[35:26]
we slow play a hand like two pair it's
just because it's a relatively weak hand

[35:29]
just because it's a relatively weak hand

[35:29]
just because it's a relatively weak hand
compared to how wet the board is. Um but

for example if we look at so we look at

often on the flop, but I think as played

[36:17]
often on the flop, but I think as played

[36:17]
often on the flop, but I think as played
on this turn, um, yeah, at these stakes,

[36:21]
on this turn, um, yeah, at these stakes,

[36:21]
on this turn, um, yeah, at these stakes,
there are still a lot of players that

[36:23]
there are still a lot of players that

[36:23]
there are still a lot of players that
just don't play dons, so therefore

[36:25]
just don't play dons, so therefore

[36:25]
just don't play dons, so therefore
they're going to be a little bit maybe

[36:28]
they're going to be a little bit maybe

[36:28]
they're going to be a little bit maybe
stronger than they should be on this

Obviously, when you have sevens, you

[39:23]
like betting because I'm scared.

[39:23]

&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. And and scared of what's

least if you now just bet tens again in

the turn. Actually, this is kind of that

[39:30]
the turn. Actually, this is kind of that

the turn. Actually, this is kind of that
example with sevens that I kind of gave

[39:31]
example with sevens that I kind of gave

[39:31]
example with sevens that I kind of gave
earlier, but here the position is a bit

[39:33]
earlier, but here the position is a bit

[39:33]
earlier, but here the position is a bit
tighter. So seven, you know, he has now

[39:36]
tighter. So seven, you know, he has now

[39:36]
tighter. So seven, you know, he has now
more eights, nines himself compared to

[39:38]
more eights, nines himself compared to

[39:38]
more eights, nines himself compared to
bottom versus big blind. So I would

[39:39]
bottom versus big blind. So I would

[39:39]
bottom versus big blind. So I would
again say that this is uh probably just

[39:41]
again say that this is uh probably just

[39:41]
again say that this is uh probably just
a check in these positions and let him

[39:43]
a check in these positions and let him

[39:43]
a check in these positions and let him
bluff the river. So this is where this

[39:45]
bluff the river. So this is where this

[39:45]
bluff the river. So this is where this
will be a note where I think you can

[39:47]
will be a note where I think you can

[39:47]
will be a note where I think you can
definitely increase your blue line. Um

[39:50]
definitely increase your blue line. Um

[39:50]
definitely increase your blue line. Um
then for example um turn if we go to for

[40:02]
uh uh not trapping is actually a problem

uh uh not trapping is actually a problem
is for example yeah let's go again to uh

is for example yeah let's go again to uh

[40:06]
is for example yeah let's go again to uh
to the big blind defense right as we

[40:07]
to the big blind defense right as we

to the big blind defense right as we
kind of concluded that that's probably

[40:09]
kind of concluded that that's probably

[40:09]
kind of concluded that that's probably
where the issue is um this one. So flop

[40:13]
where the issue is um this one. So flop

[40:13]
where the issue is um this one. So flop
goes check check and you have the

[40:15]
goes check check and you have the

[40:15]
goes check check and you have the
opportunity to probe the turn. We see

[40:17]
opportunity to probe the turn. We see

[40:17]
opportunity to probe the turn. We see
that you're at 87. Your two pair plus

[40:20]
that you're at 87. Your two pair plus

[40:20]
that you're at 87. Your two pair plus
bets 87% of the time where it should

[40:22]
bets 87% of the time where it should

[40:22]
bets 87% of the time where it should
only bet 62% of the time. So again, way

[40:24]
only bet 62% of the time. So again, way

[40:24]
only bet 62% of the time. So again, way
too much uh betting yourself with two

[40:28]
too much uh betting yourself with two

[40:28]
too much uh betting yourself with two

turn or river. You can actually often
make way more money by check raising

[40:36]
make way more money by check raising

[40:36]
make way more money by check raising
your your top of range than betting them

[40:38]
your your top of range than betting them

[40:38]
your your top of range than betting them
out to sell. So here for example top

[40:40]
out to sell. So here for example top

[40:40]
out to sell. So here for example top
pair over pair like the 52 versus 45.

[40:42]

This is perfect like a one pair hand.

[40:45]
This is perfect like a one pair hand.

[40:45]
This is perfect like a one pair hand.
you kind of want to just put the money

[40:46]
you kind of want to just put the money

[40:46]
you kind of want to just put the money
in yourself. You your hand is not strong

[40:48]
in yourself. You your hand is not strong

[40:48]
in yourself. You your hand is not strong
enough to check race. But the two pair

[40:50]
enough to check race. But the two pair

[40:50]
enough to check race. But the two pair
plus region, so like your very strong

[40:52]
plus region, so like your very strong

[40:52]
plus region, so like your very strong
hands, they can often make way more

[40:53]
hands, they can often make way more

[40:53]
hands, they can often make way more
money by taking an alternative line than

[40:55]
money by taking an alternative line than

[40:55]
money by taking an alternative line than
just betting themselves. So in this

[40:57]
just betting themselves. So in this

[40:57]
just betting themselves. So in this
case, it would be check raising versus

[40:58]
case, it would be check raising versus

[40:58]
case, it would be check raising versus
delay. Or let's say we go and let me see

[41:01]
delay. Or let's say we go and let me see

[41:01]
delay. Or let's say we go and let me see
the line. Check all check um check call

[41:05]
the line. Check all check um check call

[41:05]
the line. Check all check um check call
check raise for example. That would be a

[41:07]
check raise for example. That would be a

[41:07]
check raise for example. That would be a
good one. Check all check bet. We can

[41:09]
good one. Check all check bet. We can

[41:10]
good one. Check all check bet. We can
indeed see that two pair plus actually

um uh two pair plus instead of 64. So a

[41:45]
um uh two pair plus instead of 64. So a

Okay, you do a reasonable amount of over
betting. I personally don't really do a

[41:55]
betting. I personally don't really do a

[41:55]
betting. I personally don't really do a
lot of over betting small and first big

[41:56]
lot of over betting small and first big

[41:56]
lot of over betting small and first big
blind and kind of the hands that over

[41:58]
blind and kind of the hands that over

[41:58]
blind and kind of the hands that over
bet I move to a check race actually

[42:00]
bet I move to a check race actually

[42:00]
bet I move to a check race actually
myself. So I kind of bet more closer to

[42:02]
myself. So I kind of bet more closer to

[42:02]
myself. So I kind of bet more closer to
like three quarters of pot and when my

[42:04]
like three quarters of pot and when my

[42:04]
like three quarters of pot and when my
hand actually wants to go bigger I

[42:05]
hand actually wants to go bigger I

[42:05]
hand actually wants to go bigger I
actually move that hand to a check race.

[42:07]
actually move that hand to a check race.

[42:07]
actually move that hand to a check race.
That's actually going to be way more

[42:08]
That's actually going to be way more

[42:08]
That's actually going to be way more
efficient. You can get way more money in

[42:09]
efficient. You can get way more money in

[42:09]
efficient. You can get way more money in
the pot than an overb yourself if that

[42:12]
the pot than an overb yourself if that

[42:12]
the pot than an overb yourself if that
makes sense. So, these are like some

[42:13]
makes sense. So, these are like some

[42:14]
makes sense. So, these are like some
spots where you're you're kind of I

[42:17]
spots where you're you're kind of I

[42:17]
spots where you're you're kind of I
don't want to necessarily say

don't want to necessarily say
misplaying, but it's kind of a

[42:20]
misplaying, but it's kind of a

[42:20]
misplaying, but it's kind of a
suboptimal way. You think strong hand,

[42:22]
suboptimal way. You think strong hand,

[42:22]
suboptimal way. You think strong hand,
let's put money in the pot, but you can

[42:24]
let's put money in the pot, but you can

[42:24]
let's put money in the pot, but you can
actually get more money in the pot by

[42:25]
actually get more money in the pot by

[42:25]
actually get more money in the pot by
checking either on the turn or on the

[42:27]
checking either on the turn or on the

[42:28]
checking either on the turn or on the
river. And then, especially on the

[42:29]
river. And then, especially on the

[42:29]
river. And then, especially on the
river, you can sometimes check jam a

[42:31]
river, you can sometimes check jam a

[42:31]
river, you can sometimes check jam a
hand that you would otherwise just over

[42:33]
hand that you would otherwise just over

[42:33]
hand that you would otherwise just over
bet yourself and that actually loses a

[42:35]
bet yourself and that actually loses a

[42:35]
bet yourself and that actually loses a
lot of money. I know that usually

this range construction breakdown, it's

this range construction breakdown, it's
a bit easier already. Um but these are

[42:59]
a bit easier already. Um but these are

[42:59]
a bit easier already. Um but these are
definitely spots where you can make a

[43:01]
definitely spots where you can make a

[43:01]
definitely spots where you can make a
lot more money with top of your range.

[43:02]
lot more money with top of your range.

[43:02]
lot more money with top of your range.
This is also we saw your blue line not

[43:05]
This is also we saw your blue line not

[43:05]
This is also we saw your blue line not
really picking up. That's for that

[43:06]
really picking up. That's for that

[43:06]
really picking up. That's for that
reason. But in the same time, we did see

[43:09]
reason. But in the same time, we did see

[43:09]
reason. But in the same time, we did see
that people

[43:11]
that people

[43:11]
that people
um we do actually see that people do a

[43:13]
um we do actually see that people do a

[43:13]
um we do actually see that people do a
lot of overfolding on turns, right? So

[43:15]
lot of overfolding on turns, right? So

[43:15]
lot of overfolding on turns, right? So
your betting range was too strong and

[43:17]
your betting range was too strong and

[43:17]
your betting range was too strong and
not weak enough. Whereas if we go to

[43:19]
not weak enough. Whereas if we go to

[43:19]
not weak enough. Whereas if we go to
turn on average uh when you bet you can

[43:23]
turn on average uh when you bet you can

[43:23]
turn on average uh when you bet you can
see that you're betting 35% on average

[43:25]
see that you're betting 35% on average

[43:25]
see that you're betting 35% on average
on the turn, which is normal compared to

[43:27]
on the turn, which is normal compared to

[43:27]
on the turn, which is normal compared to
GTO, but your success is 49 with your

[43:29]
GTO, but your success is 49 with your

[43:29]
GTO, but your success is 49 with your
bets where it should be 41. So this is a

[43:31]
bets where it should be 41. So this is a

[43:31]
bets where it should be 41. So this is a
general trend of just massive

[43:33]
general trend of just massive

[43:33]
general trend of just massive
overfolding of the pool and what you're

[43:35]
overfolding of the pool and what you're

[43:35]
overfolding of the pool and what you're
doing actually you're creating a betting

[43:36]
doing actually you're creating a betting

[43:36]
doing actually you're creating a betting
range that's way too strong. Okay. So

[43:39]
range that's way too strong. Okay. So

[43:39]
range that's way too strong. Okay. So
this actually again it doesn't play in

[43:41]
this actually again it doesn't play in

[43:41]
this actually again it doesn't play in
the weakness of the pool. It's the

[43:42]
the weakness of the pool. It's the

[43:42]
the weakness of the pool. It's the
opposite. The pool kind of exploits you

[43:44]
opposite. The pool kind of exploits you

[43:44]
opposite. The pool kind of exploits you
naturally which is usually the worst

[43:46]
naturally which is usually the worst

[43:46]
naturally which is usually the worst
thing that that kind of can happen. Um

[43:49]
thing that that kind of can happen. Um

[43:49]
thing that that kind of can happen. Um
so that's definitely something uh to

[43:51]
so that's definitely something uh to

[43:51]
so that's definitely something uh to
point out on like one note if we go back

[43:53]
point out on like one note if we go back

[43:53]
point out on like one note if we go back
to your big blind game right that was

[43:54]
to your big blind game right that was

[43:54]
to your big blind game right that was
very kind of I think what's going to be

[43:56]
very kind of I think what's going to be

[43:56]
very kind of I think what's going to be

with your turn probe where it should be

[44:12]
with your turn probe where it should be

[44:12]
with your turn probe where it should be
35. So you're getting uh 13% overfold

[44:16]
35. So you're getting uh 13% overfold

&gt;&gt; So again like definitely a point of

[44:25]
&gt;&gt; So again like definitely a point of

[44:25]
&gt;&gt; So again like definitely a point of
point of intention. So slow play more

[44:27]
point of intention. So slow play more

[44:27]
point of intention. So slow play more
the top of your range and bet more air

[44:30]
the top of your range and bet more air

[44:30]
the top of your range and bet more air
and then naturally actually you you your

tend to just stab quite often right if

tend to just stab quite often right if
you check to them or if you've you've

you check to them or if you've you've
shown weakness people people tend to

[45:12]
shown weakness people people tend to

shown weakness people people tend to
stab and then you've got a check raise

[45:14]
stab and then you've got a check raise

stab and then you've got a check raise
opportunity and you actually get more

money in the pot. So

[45:16]
money in the pot. So

[45:16]

&gt;&gt; yeah, that's the thing, right? Because

[45:17]
&gt;&gt; yeah, that's the thing, right? Because

[45:17]
&gt;&gt; yeah, that's the thing, right? Because
yes, sure, you're going to miss it more

&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.

[45:25]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.

[45:25]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.
&gt;&gt; Right. So that's kind of the the the the

[45:28]
&gt;&gt; Right. So that's kind of the the the the

&gt;&gt; Right. So that's kind of the the the the
correction there. Um

let me see. Then I had one point to add

let me see. Then I had one point to add

If you go through all these stats, you

If you go through all these stats, you

If you go through all these stats, you
will find hundreds of leaks, right? I

[46:28]
will find hundreds of leaks, right? I

[46:28]
will find hundreds of leaks, right? I
also find hundreds of leaks. How do we

[46:30]
also find hundreds of leaks. How do we

[46:30]
also find hundreds of leaks. How do we
prioritize that? And then how do we

prioritize that? And then how do we

prioritize that? And then how do we
diagnose what's the problem? How do we

[46:33]
diagnose what's the problem? How do we

Uh so this is something that actually we

Uh so this is something that actually we
help you with. So and you also arrive to

you're underfolding the river which is

in your game, as we will see in a

briefly that before the call that you

can actually see that your sizing scheme

[49:55]
can actually see that your sizing scheme

instead of 34. So batfolding gutshots,

[1:08:17]
instead of 34. So batfolding gutshots,

for example, seems to be a problem.

you're even bat folding good draws 8.2
versus two. So that's definitely a

problem. Um and you're folding some

[1:08:26]
problem. Um and you're folding some

[1:08:26]
problem. Um and you're folding some
middle pairs. So if I look at fold to

[1:08:27]
middle pairs. So if I look at fold to

example, this is a blind versus blind

[1:08:39]
example, this is a blind versus blind

[1:08:39]
example, this is a blind versus blind
spot. We see bat fill and raises. This

is a in general you don't want to fold a

[1:08:43]
is a in general you don't want to fold a

[1:08:43]
is a in general you don't want to fold a
gutshot with an SPR like this. It's very

[1:08:46]
gutshot with an SPR like this. It's very

[1:08:46]
gutshot with an SPR like this. It's very
very rare. Uh so that's definitely some

[1:08:49]
very rare. Uh so that's definitely some

[1:08:49]
very rare. Uh so that's definitely some
point to pay attention to. Uh or we

[1:08:53]
point to pay attention to. Uh or we

[1:08:53]
point to pay attention to. Uh or we
should maybe not bet the gutshot in the

[1:08:55]
should maybe not bet the gutshot in the

[1:08:55]
should maybe not bet the gutshot in the
first place if we expect a lot of

[1:08:56]
first place if we expect a lot of

[1:08:56]
first place if we expect a lot of
raises. So what's this?

[1:09:00]
raises. So what's this?

[1:09:00]
raises. So what's this?
This is for example uh I find this

[1:09:03]
This is for example uh I find this

[1:09:03]
This is for example uh I find this
actually a good example that I would

the hands that you're bet puking that's

[1:09:11]
the hands that you're bet puking that's

[1:09:11]
the hands that you're bet puking that's
the hands you want to check back. So

[1:09:13]
the hands you want to check back. So

[1:09:13]
the hands you want to check back. So
this hand for example, you step the

[1:09:15]
this hand for example, you step the

[1:09:15]
this hand for example, you step the
thing half pot and he check raises. You

[1:09:16]
thing half pot and he check raises. You

[1:09:16]
thing half pot and he check raises. You
kind of puked. You folded but probably

[1:09:19]
kind of puked. You folded but probably

[1:09:19]
kind of puked. You folded but probably
not with you know I mean you to be fair

[1:09:22]
not with you know I mean you to be fair

[1:09:22]
not with you know I mean you to be fair
I don't think this is actually a fold.

[1:09:24]
I don't think this is actually a fold.

I don't think this is actually a fold.
He does go a bit bigger but probably is

[1:09:25]
He does go a bit bigger but probably is

He does go a bit bigger but probably is
not a fold. Um so again it would be uh

[1:09:29]
not a fold. Um so again it would be uh

[1:09:29]
not a fold. Um so again it would be uh
but to kind of help with this let's say

right and this board I think that's

[1:09:36]
right and this board I think that's

fold 64 offuit, no diamond. So that's

[1:09:46]
fold 64 offuit, no diamond. So that's

[1:09:46]
fold 64 offuit, no diamond. So that's
the hand that I would bet and then I

[1:09:47]
the hand that I would bet and then I

[1:09:47]
the hand that I would bet and then I
would check back 64 with a diamond. If I

would check back 64 with a diamond. If I
have 54 with a diamond, I would

obviously bet that always because I can

you could use. Um

[1:10:07]
you could use. Um

so let me see. Yeah. So, you're either

so let me see. Yeah. So, you're either

the 56 that you shouldn't you should

maybe be shouldn't be betting or you

should just call to the check race. So,

[1:10:20]
should just call to the check race. So,

should just call to the check race. So,
the draws is definitely a problem. I

[1:10:22]
the draws is definitely a problem. I

the draws is definitely a problem. I
even saw you folded good draw. So, I

[1:10:23]
even saw you folded good draw. So, I

even saw you folded good draw. So, I
don't know what good draw would be draw

[1:10:27]
don't know what good draw would be draw

[1:10:27]
don't know what good draw would be draw
but I don't think we get to fold a good

&gt;&gt; Does that make sense? Like,

[1:11:28]
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense? Like,

[1:11:28]
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense? Like,
&gt;&gt; yeah, it makes a lot of sense. Or I

&gt;&gt; yeah, it makes a lot of sense. Or I

that where I'm a little bit less about

that where I'm a little bit less about

[1:11:36]
that where I'm a little bit less about
it.

[1:11:37]
it.

[1:11:37]
it.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Um, and I think we also saw

[1:11:40]
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Um, and I think we also saw

[1:11:40]
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Um, and I think we also saw
like some middle pairs.

[1:11:42]
like some middle pairs.

[1:11:42]
like some middle pairs.
Um,

[1:11:44]
Um,

[1:11:44]
Um,
so this one would be a great example.

[1:11:51]
You see, one third you face a check

[1:11:52]
You see, one third you face a check

[1:11:52]
You see, one third you face a check
race. I mean, he could check race. This

[1:11:55]
race. I mean, he could check race. This

[1:11:55]
race. I mean, he could check race. This
is a spot where for example in theory

[1:11:57]
is a spot where for example in theory

[1:11:57]
is a spot where for example in theory
you should be check raising 54 76. So

[1:11:59]
you should be check raising 54 76. So

[1:12:00]
you should be check raising 54 76. So
there's plenty of even worse and pocket

[1:12:01]
there's plenty of even worse and pocket

[1:12:01]
there's plenty of even worse and pocket
eights probably maybe check race at a

[1:12:03]
eights probably maybe check race at a

eights probably maybe check race at a
very low frequency. Um, and I think

[1:12:06]
very low frequency. Um, and I think

[1:12:06]
very low frequency. Um, and I think
maybe you're underestimating, but

[1:12:07]
maybe you're underestimating, but

[1:12:07]
maybe you're underestimating, but
turning a nine, I know it's very

[1:12:09]
turning a nine, I know it's very

[1:12:09]
turning a nine, I know it's very
unfrequent, but turning a nine could win

[1:12:10]
unfrequent, but turning a nine could win

[1:12:10]
unfrequent, but turning a nine could win
you a stack, right? So, if you just

[1:12:12]
you a stack, right? So, if you just

[1:12:12]
you a stack, right? So, if you just
think about implied odds, odds, you you

[1:12:15]
think about implied odds, odds, you you

[1:12:15]
think about implied odds, odds, you you
probably already there. So, uh, that

[1:12:18]
probably already there. So, uh, that

[1:12:18]
probably already there. So, uh, that
would be

[1:12:19]
would be

[1:12:19]
would be
&gt;&gt; I think

[1:12:20]
&gt;&gt; I think

[1:12:20]
&gt;&gt; I think
&gt;&gt; yeah,

[1:12:20]
&gt;&gt; yeah,

[1:12:20]
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; this was probably one of those where I

[1:12:22]
&gt;&gt; this was probably one of those where I

a not huge check raise, you just have to

be have to be calling second pair or

[1:12:41]
be have to be calling second pair or

be have to be calling second pair or
hands better than second pair.

[1:12:42]
hands better than second pair.

[1:12:42]
hands better than second pair.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, for example, especially here,

[1:12:45]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, for example, especially here,

[1:12:45]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, for example, especially here,
if you think about, for example, if you

[1:12:47]
if you think about, for example, if you

[1:12:47]
if you think about, for example, if you
have sixes, well, then you're dead

[1:12:48]
have sixes, well, then you're dead

[1:12:48]
have sixes, well, then you're dead
against sevens, right? Uh, nines at

[1:12:51]
against sevens, right? Uh, nines at

[1:12:51]
against sevens, right? Uh, nines at
least can still draw out against seven.

[1:12:53]
least can still draw out against seven.

[1:12:53]
least can still draw out against seven.
So, even if you see your hand as a draw,

[1:12:55]
So, even if you see your hand as a draw,

[1:12:55]
So, even if you see your hand as a draw,
uh, which in general, I think is a good

[1:12:57]
uh, which in general, I think is a good

[1:12:57]
uh, which in general, I think is a good
way to look at poker, uh, just think

[1:12:59]
way to look at poker, uh, just think

[1:12:59]
way to look at poker, uh, just think
about every hand in terms of drawing to

[1:13:01]
about every hand in terms of drawing to

[1:13:01]
about every hand in terms of drawing to
towards equity and the EV of that. Well,

[1:13:03]
towards equity and the EV of that. Well,

[1:13:03]
towards equity and the EV of that. Well,
drawing towards the turn set or ri set

[1:13:05]
drawing towards the turn set or ri set

[1:13:05]
drawing towards the turn set or ri set
is pretty good money if he has a bottom

[1:13:08]
is pretty good money if he has a bottom

[1:13:08]
is pretty good money if he has a bottom
set. So if we just add only that factor

[1:13:10]
set. So if we just add only that factor

[1:13:10]
set. So if we just add only that factor
already in this actually we can actually

[1:13:12]
already in this actually we can actually

[1:13:12]
already in this actually we can actually
make quite some money. We will just

[1:13:14]
make quite some money. We will just

[1:13:14]
make quite some money. We will just
maximally lose what is this five and a

maximally lose what is this five and a

maximally lose what is this five and a
half big blinds more and we could

[1:13:17]
half big blinds more and we could

[1:13:18]
half big blinds more and we could
potentially win a stack. Um if you look

[1:13:21]
potentially win a stack. Um if you look

[1:13:21]
potentially win a stack. Um if you look
at poker optimistically like like I do

[1:13:23]
at poker optimistically like like I do

[1:13:23]
at poker optimistically like like I do
learning to look at poker optimistically

[1:13:25]
learning to look at poker optimistically

[1:13:25]
learning to look at poker optimistically
uh is actually something that and I

[1:13:27]
uh is actually something that and I

[1:13:27]
uh is actually something that and I
actually I pointed out this 89 as well

[1:13:29]
actually I pointed out this 89 as well

[1:13:30]
actually I pointed out this 89 as well
just again like he could raise 78 uh so

[1:13:32]
just again like he could raise 78 uh so

[1:13:32]
just again like he could raise 78 uh so
he could even raise worse. So this is um

[1:13:36]
he could even raise worse. So this is um

[1:13:36]
he could even raise worse. So this is um
yeah definitely a point to pay attention

[1:13:38]
yeah definitely a point to pay attention

[1:13:38]
yeah definitely a point to pay attention
to. So like these flop pet faults um is

[1:13:41]
to. So like these flop pet faults um is

[1:13:41]
to. So like these flop pet faults um is
something that I noticed other than

[1:13:42]
something that I noticed other than

something that I noticed other than

you still don't really know right.

[1:13:47]
you still don't really know right.

[1:13:48]
you still don't really know right.
Right. So this are where I think I hope

[1:13:49]
Right. So this are where I think I hope

[1:13:49]
Right. So this are where I think I hope
I can see now the value that you

[1:13:51]
I can see now the value that you

[1:13:51]
I can see now the value that you
straight away can see okay which hand

[1:13:52]
straight away can see okay which hand

[1:13:52]
straight away can see okay which hand
class is causing the problem. Right. So

[1:13:55]
class is causing the problem. Right. So

[1:13:55]
class is causing the problem. Right. So
that's kind of where uh where I think

[1:13:57]
that's kind of where uh where I think

[1:13:57]
that's kind of where uh where I think
the values of an extensive breakdown

we can see that versus a 13 bed you're

so that's 13% overfold so quite

[1:14:40]
so that's 13% overfold so quite

um So you're folding hands that are air.

[1:14:47]
um So you're folding hands that are air.

[1:14:47]
um So you're folding hands that are air.
So if we look at air, I mean you're

[1:14:49]
So if we look at air, I mean you're

[1:14:49]
So if we look at air, I mean you're
folding low pockets. Usually you don't

a bigger bet. So let me see. This is

[1:14:56]
a bigger bet. So let me see. This is

for example, you would not fold fold
this hand for half pot. I would I would

&gt;&gt; That's what I said about the the

[1:16:27]
&gt;&gt; That's what I said about the the

[1:16:27]
&gt;&gt; That's what I said about the the
emotional bluff catching. So it's like

[1:16:29]
emotional bluff catching. So it's like

[1:16:29]
emotional bluff catching. So it's like
you get triggered by strength instead of

[1:16:31]
you get triggered by strength instead of

you get triggered by strength instead of
triggered by weakness. Um so this is

we first need to make the correct

part of their brain. It doesn't work

[1:17:31]
part of their brain. It doesn't work

part of their brain. It doesn't work
like that. Uh so, the correct diagnose

[1:17:32]
like that. Uh so, the correct diagnose

[1:17:32]
like that. Uh so, the correct diagnose
is very important. So, this would be

[1:17:34]
is very important. So, this would be

is very important. So, this would be
another one. Ace5. I would say this

[1:17:36]
another one. Ace5. I would say this

another one. Ace5. I would say this
either raise or call. uh we press fold.

[1:17:39]
either raise or call. uh we press fold.

[1:17:39]
either raise or call. uh we press fold.
Um so this is definitely uh something to

it's quite a big overfold. So it cannot

&gt;&gt; yeah so that's definitely uh one of the

if I go to turn offense, we already

definitely something we should be

yes turn. So again the defense problem.

[1:20:57]
yes turn. So again the defense problem.

So

So
if we look at folding, you're actually

[1:21:07]
if we look at folding, you're actually

if we look at folding, you're actually
underfolding when you're out of position

[1:21:09]
underfolding when you're out of position

[1:21:09]
underfolding when you're out of position
mainly. So this is mainly going to be

you're overfolding in position. I would

[1:21:15]
you're overfolding in position. I would

[1:21:15]
you're overfolding in position. I would
much rather see this be the other way

[1:21:16]
much rather see this be the other way

[1:21:16]
much rather see this be the other way
around if that makes sense.

[1:21:21]
Yeah. Yeah, that makes that makes sense

[1:21:23]
Yeah. Yeah, that makes that makes sense

[1:21:23]
Yeah. Yeah, that makes that makes sense
for sure.

[1:21:24]
for sure.

[1:21:24]
for sure.
&gt;&gt; But actually looking at like phase back

[1:21:26]
&gt;&gt; But actually looking at like phase back

[1:21:26]
&gt;&gt; But actually looking at like phase back
in terms of your game, this is quite an

[1:21:28]
in terms of your game, this is quite an

[1:21:28]
in terms of your game, this is quite an
interesting stat. So this is how often

[1:21:29]
interesting stat. So this is how often

[1:21:29]
interesting stat. So this is how often
when you call the turn, how often you

[1:21:31]
when you call the turn, how often you

[1:21:31]
when you call the turn, how often you
face aggression on the river. So this is

[1:21:33]
face aggression on the river. So this is

[1:21:33]
face aggression on the river. So this is
direct feedback from the games, the

[1:21:36]
direct feedback from the games, the

[1:21:36]
direct feedback from the games, the
hands that you played and the pools that

[1:21:37]
hands that you played and the pools that

[1:21:37]
hands that you played and the pools that
you played, what people are doing

[1:21:39]
you played, what people are doing

[1:21:39]
you played, what people are doing
against you. And actually, we can see

[1:21:40]
against you. And actually, we can see

[1:21:40]
against you. And actually, we can see
that when you're out of position and you

[1:21:42]
that when you're out of position and you

[1:21:42]
that when you're out of position and you
call the turn, you're going to actually

[1:21:44]
call the turn, you're going to actually

[1:21:44]
call the turn, you're going to actually
face aggression on the river 3% less

[1:21:47]
face aggression on the river 3% less

[1:21:47]
face aggression on the river 3% less
than average. Now, this is actually not

specifically versus you. This is

[1:21:51]

specifically versus you. This is
actually a trend that I mainly see

actually a trend that I mainly see

actually a trend that I mainly see
overall. And that's because kind of what

[1:21:55]
overall. And that's because kind of what

overall. And that's because kind of what
you're doing. A lot of people they play

bat bat check with medium holdings. So,

what you usually see in just real games

[1:22:02]
what you usually see in just real games

[1:22:02]
what you usually see in just real games
compared to GTO is that people's turn

[1:22:04]
compared to GTO is that people's turn

[1:22:04]
compared to GTO is that people's turn
aggression is higher and then on the

[1:22:07]
aggression is higher and then on the

[1:22:07]
aggression is higher and then on the
river their aggression is lower. And

[1:22:09]
river their aggression is lower. And

[1:22:09]
river their aggression is lower. And
then the opportunity there is then

[1:22:11]
then the opportunity there is then

[1:22:11]
then the opportunity there is then
usually to overfold the turn to some

[1:22:13]
usually to overfold the turn to some

[1:22:13]
usually to overfold the turn to some
degree because yes, they're betting more

[1:22:15]
degree because yes, they're betting more

[1:22:15]
degree because yes, they're betting more
and they're giving up the river, but

[1:22:16]
and they're giving up the river, but

[1:22:16]
and they're giving up the river, but
they're betting more value hands that

[1:22:19]
they're betting more value hands that

[1:22:19]
they're betting more value hands that
actually should be defending them. So

[1:22:21]
actually should be defending them. So

actually should be defending them. So
the correct exploit is usually overfold

[1:22:23]
the correct exploit is usually overfold

[1:22:23]
the correct exploit is usually overfold

and things like that. So this one I

would probably already fold the flop

[1:26:23]
would probably already fold the flop

[1:26:23]
would probably already fold the flop
&gt;&gt; and definitely fold the turn.

[1:26:26]
&gt;&gt; and definitely fold the turn.

[1:26:26]
&gt;&gt; and definitely fold the turn.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

[1:26:27]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

[1:26:27]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And definitely fold the river.

[1:26:29]
&gt;&gt; And definitely fold the river.

[1:26:29]
&gt;&gt; And definitely fold the river.
&gt;&gt; So yeah, again versus like earlier

you see the river your win rate is minus
10 instead of 42. So that's a problem.

[1:27:19]
10 instead of 42. So that's a problem.

value betting quite thin when you're in
position. Um, which means that on the

[1:29:00]
river, your check strong is 14 should be

river, your check strong is 14 should be
21. That means that you're value betting

[1:29:02]
21. That means that you're value betting

[1:29:02]
21. That means that you're value betting
hands that are just check back. So

[1:29:03]
hands that are just check back. So

this is not good if people punish you,

but we can actually see that you face a

[1:29:11]
raise on the river in position 6% where

raise on the river in position 6% where
it should be 9%. So the way you punish

[1:29:13]
it should be 9%. So the way you punish

bluff catch but turn those hands into a

bluff catch but turn those hands into a

bluff catch but turn those hands into a
bluff. So it seems you're you're making

[1:29:20]
bluff. So it seems you're you're making

[1:29:20]
bluff. So it seems you're you're making
a deviation. So just this set alone, you

[1:29:22]
a deviation. So just this set alone, you

[1:29:22]
a deviation. So just this set alone, you
would say, hey, you have a leak. You

[1:29:23]
would say, hey, you have a leak. You

[1:29:23]
would say, hey, you have a leak. You
shouldn't do that. But it's not

[1:29:25]
shouldn't do that. But it's not

something that gets exploited. It

[1:29:26]
something that gets exploited. It

[1:29:26]
something that gets exploited. It
actually does not get exploited because

[1:29:28]
actually does not get exploited because

[1:29:28]
actually does not get exploited because
it's 6% instead of nine. if if they will

[1:29:30]
it's 6% instead of nine. if if they will

[1:29:30]
it's 6% instead of nine. if if they will
get exploited is 12% instead of nine.

[1:29:32]
get exploited is 12% instead of nine.

[1:29:32]
get exploited is 12% instead of nine.
But something to become aware of, maybe

[1:29:33]
But something to become aware of, maybe

[1:29:33]
But something to become aware of, maybe
you're value betting hands that you just

[1:29:35]
you're value betting hands that you just

[1:29:35]
you're value betting hands that you just
think are normal value bets. So maybe

[1:29:37]
think are normal value bets. So maybe

[1:29:37]
think are normal value bets. So maybe
you're making exploit without knowing

[1:29:39]
you're making exploit without knowing

[1:29:39]
you're making exploit without knowing
it, right? That's obviously a problem.

[1:29:41]
it, right? That's obviously a problem.

We we deviations are great as long as

So it can be just that you just have a

[1:29:48]
So it can be just that you just have a

[1:29:48]
So it can be just that you just have a
bad habit of making thin value bets

[1:29:50]
bad habit of making thin value bets

[1:29:50]
bad habit of making thin value bets

Um

Um
so basically for the for the people

[1:30:19]
so basically for the for the people

[1:30:19]
so basically for the for the people
watching this is just uh your river game

[1:30:21]
watching this is just uh your river game

watching this is just uh your river game
broken down into uh all the lines that

[1:30:24]
broken down into uh all the lines that

[1:30:24]
broken down into uh all the lines that
you can take uh how successful certain

[1:30:26]
you can take uh how successful certain

[1:30:26]
you can take uh how successful certain
lines are. So for example we can

[1:30:28]
lines are. So for example we can

[1:30:28]
lines are. So for example we can
actually see that your bet your

[1:30:29]
actually see that your bet your

[1:30:29]
actually see that your bet your
continuous so bad bet line uh that's

[1:30:32]
continuous so bad bet line uh that's

[1:30:32]
continuous so bad bet line uh that's
actually under bluffed and actually it

[1:30:33]
actually under bluffed and actually it

[1:30:34]
actually under bluffed and actually it
gets underfolded as well by population.

[1:30:35]
gets underfolded as well by population.

[1:30:35]
gets underfolded as well by population.
So you're getting 52% success where it

[1:30:37]
So you're getting 52% success where it

[1:30:37]
So you're getting 52% success where it
should be 54. So people are overalling

[1:30:40]
should be 54. So people are overalling

[1:30:40]
should be 54. So people are overalling
and that's again people who have already

[1:30:41]
and that's again people who have already

[1:30:42]
and that's again people who have already
overfold flop and turn. So therefore

[1:30:43]
overfold flop and turn. So therefore

[1:30:43]
overfold flop and turn. So therefore
they just arrive with a stronger range

[1:30:45]
they just arrive with a stronger range

[1:30:45]
they just arrive with a stronger range
on the river. So actually you're under

[1:30:46]
on the river. So actually you're under

[1:30:46]
on the river. So actually you're under
bluffing but that's actually

[1:30:47]
bluffing but that's actually

[1:30:48]
bluffing but that's actually
incentivized. Um and you're overbluffing

[1:30:51]
incentivized. Um and you're overbluffing

[1:30:51]
incentivized. Um and you're overbluffing
for example a bic line and that's

[1:30:53]
for example a bic line and that's

[1:30:53]
for example a bic line and that's
actually overfolded by 14%. So from that

[1:30:56]
actually overfolded by 14%. So from that

[1:30:56]
actually overfolded by 14%. So from that
perspective you're doing something very

[1:30:58]
perspective you're doing something very

[1:30:58]
perspective you're doing something very
well. Um but like I said it's more of a

[1:31:00]
well. Um but like I said it's more of a

[1:31:00]
well. Um but like I said it's more of a
trick. You just keep keep on bet

[1:31:02]
trick. You just keep keep on bet

[1:31:02]
trick. You just keep keep on bet
bluffing and for example you miss bluffs

[1:31:04]
bluffing and for example you miss bluffs

[1:31:04]

in call check bet. That would for

[1:31:06]
in call check bet. That would for

[1:31:06]
in call check bet. That would for
example be a line that I think you

[1:31:08]
example be a line that I think you

[1:31:08]
example be a line that I think you
should definitely bluff more. uh check

[1:31:10]
should definitely bluff more. uh check

[1:31:10]
should definitely bluff more. uh check
check bat uh stuff like that. So, seems

[1:31:13]
check bat uh stuff like that. So, seems

[1:31:14]
check bat uh stuff like that. So, seems
like your bluffing game is very

[1:31:15]
like your bluffing game is very

[1:31:15]
like your bluffing game is very
one-dimensional, like a big sizing or a
