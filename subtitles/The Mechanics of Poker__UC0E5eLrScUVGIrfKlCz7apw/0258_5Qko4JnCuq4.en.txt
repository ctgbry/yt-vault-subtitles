[00:02]
see someone's leaks.
Any worries then that people uh people
might see your leaks
&gt;&gt; or it's worth it it's it's worth the
tradeoff.

[00:21]
&gt;&gt; Nice.
&gt;&gt; So you you fought this all out.

[00:31]
Let me see.
I think we should be live. Check.
So, that's good.

[00:48]
There is some delay. Don't know why.
Quite a bit of delay actually. probably
like 10 seconds or so,

[01:00]
like 10 seconds or so,
but uh I mean it shouldn't
shouldn't ruin the party.
So, how about uh we start off maybe a
little bit introduction of yourself. I
made a post a while back already uh on

[01:15]
made a post a while back already uh on
on on YouTube that I was looking for
some people who would be interested in
having their game reviewed live on
YouTube. You were one of the guys who
responded uh wrote down your story to
me. me. I thought it was interesting.
So, we we started chatting and here we

[01:30]
So, we we started chatting and here we
are. So, maybe you give the audience a
little bit some info about yourself.

[01:57]
The last

[02:14]
year and a half or so.

[02:17]
year and a half or so.
player, so playing online and um yeah,
just finding my feet, learning a lot and
uh yeah, doing my best to improve and
yeah, I'm originally from Scotland but
currently living in Brazil

[02:31]
currently living in Brazil
and looking forward to getting into it.
&gt;&gt; All right, I think I think we're going
to have to do that again because I I get
comments and nobody hears you. So, I'm
checking here my settings. Let me fix
that.
&gt;&gt; Okay,
&gt;&gt; maybe they started hearing you at some
point.

[02:45]
point.
Uh if some people could confirm that
better now. Okay. Yeah. So okay now.
Yeah. Okay. So I know what the problem
was then.
&gt;&gt; So they heard nothing of me or should I
do it again or

[03:04]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No. Now that should be good. So I
think everyone can hear you. I think
everyone can hear me. So let's let's do
this again.
&gt;&gt; Excellent.
&gt;&gt; Damn. All right. Okay.
&gt;&gt; How about if you tell us a little bit

[03:16]
&gt;&gt; How about if you tell us a little bit
something about yourself this time with
audio so you know the audience can also
listen.
&gt;&gt; Sounds great. Sounds great. Well, hi
everybody. Um, so my name is Dan. H go
by Dan C in these poker Discord worlds.

[03:30]
by Dan C in these poker Discord worlds.
Probably best known for playing as
Peaceful Journey over on Coin Poker. Uh,
it's where the bulk of my volume is. And
yeah, I currently play 200 NL online.
I've played for the best best part of
the last 10 years. and I'm currently 29

[03:45]
the last 10 years. and I'm currently 29
years old. For the bulk of the time when
I've played poker, I've been a
recreational player whilst working in
the industry. I worked for Run at Once
Poker for a good period of time and
yeah, for the past year or so, I've been

[04:00]
yeah, for the past year or so, I've been
playing full-time trying to make it as a
professional player. And that's it's
been up and down and as we'll see, but
uh yeah, I'm learning a lot and looking
forward to seeing what we can discover
here about my game.

[04:15]
here about my game.
&gt;&gt; All right, for the people uh that
haven't noticed, it's hard because we've
been pushing it. Uh we brought out a new
leakbuster program and uh step one in if
you want to become a better poker player
in my opinion is to become aware, right?

[04:30]
in my opinion is to become aware, right?
We talked about that last week in the
live stream as well. And I think I said
this in the in the post leading up to
this as well. Um, and that usually
starts with analyzing your data because
that's the best way to get feedback on
what you're really doing, right?
Unbiased feedback. Many times in my

[04:45]
Unbiased feedback. Many times in my
poker career, I thought that I was doing
something or thought that I was not
doing something and then I looked at
data and it was completely or at least I
might do something, right? One hand
stood out or another hand stood out. But
if I looked at the frequency, I was just
not reaching the frequency or I was
starting to do things that I actually

[05:00]
starting to do things that I actually
was not aware of that I was starting to
do. So uh becoming aware right of your
tendencies
uh and from your tendencies seeing what
are leaks and what are actual deviations
that are actually uh making you money

[05:15]
that are actually uh making you money
right a leak is not necessarily any
deviation made from from theory. Um, so
the step one in how to best improve as a
poker player is to do some is to do like
a database review, right? In our league
buster program, we have a tool which

[05:31]
buster program, we have a tool which
you'll get with the program. It's the
mechanics leagueinder. I used to have
this tool already exclusively in our
CFP. Then in our mechanics of poker
program, I've done database reviews,
leak findings, stat checking, however
you want to call it for probably the

[05:45]
you want to call it for probably the
last 10 years of my career. And that has
evolved from I think I showed you guys
this last last week from writing notes
writing stuff down on a whiteboard or
pen and paper uh to what we have
nowadays right in the past also we

[06:00]
nowadays right in the past also we
didn't have GTO benchmarks available
across the tree nowadays we have so we
have a lot more clarity and we kind of
know what's quote quote correct um so
yeah today I will walk through the leak
finder tab by tap and we will I will

[06:15]
finder tab by tap and we will I will
kind of show you guys how to go about
leak finding and doing a database
review. And this is also kind of what
the program is about, right? It's about
teaching you how to do it, giving you
the tools and then teaching you how to
best work with data. Uh so it's not like

[06:30]
best work with data. Uh so it's not like
here's a tool, good luck because I think
a lot of mistakes actually are made.
It's a powerful tool, but in the wrong
hands, uh I think it can do a lot of
harm as well. So the education around
working with data and how to leak find
and then obviously after you found the
leaks now now what right I chatted

[06:45]
leaks now now what right I chatted
already a little bit with them prior
going in okay these are kind of your
main leaks that I found now what right
and the now what is usually then what's
missing and that's what I've been trying
to focus on with this program like I
said I wanted to bring a program that
was different than others there's plenty
of programs like this like stat checking

[07:01]
of programs like this like stat checking
leak finding type of uh hand toot step
packages uh I think we did a better job
right it's way more complete. Uh, but
obviously we help you after you found
your leaks as well. Um, any questions in

[07:15]
your leaks as well. Um, any questions in
the meantime, you know, I will keep an
eye on the chat. I believe my partner in
crime, Dan, is somewhere around here as
well to answer some of your questions.
And yeah, without further ado, uh, let's
get into it. You excited, Dan? You
curious?
&gt;&gt; Buzzing, mate. Let's go.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, we start at the start,

[07:32]
&gt;&gt; All right. So, we start at the start,
uh, the general overview where we just
see your win rate. Uh also based on 700,
5 to 600 3 to 400, we see that you've
done a decent amount of battles, doing
well there. Uh this brown number that
you see is the average number of

[07:45]
you see is the average number of
population. So on average, the
population loses when they're uh rack
battling. You seem to be doing well.
This is actually something that's very
present in my game usually as well. It's
just when I battle, I'm way more
engaged, way more focused, uh and I
usually play well. So it's not
necessarily that my opponents are worse,

[08:01]
necessarily that my opponents are worse,
they're actually better, but I play
better as well. It's actually something
that I explain in the program as well
that u you know the reason why you might
do something is might not even be a
technical mistake. It might be a focus
and engagement mistake right and that's

[08:15]
and engagement mistake right and that's
why it's very important to diagnose
correctly. So if we look at this tab
this is just very basic some win rates.
The first thing that I noticed actually
in your game is this one. If we look at
the win rates per position I think we're
working with like 150k hands right yeah

[08:30]
working with like 150k hands right yeah
here on the right top 150k hands. This
is the this is your win rate. This is
the win rate of bots. Now take in
consideration these bots, you know, they
have a win rate of zero in the end,
right? Because they're playing against
bots and they don't pay any rake. So
ideally, we would outperform the bots,

[08:45]
ideally, we would outperform the bots,
right? Um and the win rates behind that
are the win rates of an average
population. So obviously we would like
that's kind of more of maybe a real
benchmark in terms of okay, what win
rates can I expect on average for a
human being playing in these games? And

[09:00]
human being playing in these games? And
then the one thing that I straight away
noticed was the big blind minus 88 minus
848.
Uh on the other in the other areas, you
know, you perform the same or even
better. So like EPMP cut off, it's
mainly in the blinds where at first
glance, right, if you if we just look

[09:16]
glance, right, if you if we just look
purely at the win rate, uh that's kind
of where there's room for improvement.
Now this is very important uh when you
do database analysis that you don't go
blind on one stat. Now some people might
look, yeah, okay, win rate is not
reliable 150k hands. I completely agree.

[09:30]
reliable 150k hands. I completely agree.
But it's one piece of information.
That's usually how I how I like to do
database reviews. This is something that
I will now note down. Okay. At at the
first layer that we start gathering
information about your game. We've
identified that your big blend rim rate
is quite low. Okay. Let's keep that in
mind. Let's note that somewhere and

[09:45]
mind. Let's note that somewhere and
let's continue gathering evidence.
Right? And as you will later see uh if
we go through the tabs that this this
point will ever time come back. And this
is very important to help identify where
exactly something is going wrong. Right?
So for now, that's basically the most

[10:02]
So for now, that's basically the most
important thing that I want to get from
this tab. Like I said, you can just get
some general information, win rate
information. Obviously, you need huge
samples for just this individual stat to
be actual accurate. Right? In the short

[10:15]
be actual accurate. Right? In the short
term, it can also serve more as like
variance indicators, especially um stuff
like facing a treebat. So for example,
here versus three bet. Uh so this is in
general when you face a three bet uh you
seem to be losing less uh more than you
should. Um but obviously just this alone

[10:33]
should. Um but obviously just this alone
is is is not really going to say much
here. We can do see like versus the
open. So let's say you're in the big
blind and you face an open we see that
when you call you lose twice as what
you're supposed to lose. So based on

[10:45]
you're supposed to lose. So based on
just this sheet, we could say that okay,
defending from the big blind is probably
going to be a problem area for you
purely based on this first sheet, right?
Um and we're going to gather information
later on and then see if that's true or
that's false or we have to re uh um kind

[11:02]
that's false or we have to re uh um kind
of retest this observation. So if we can
then go to the next tab, sub games,
there we can just see your win rates
across all um all spots. And if we
straight away look at for example out of
position pre flop collar single race

[11:16]
position pre flop collar single race
spot. So that would be for example big
blind defense we can indeed see you're
winning at minus or you're losing at
minus 108 whereas GTO would be minus 45.
But obviously they pay no rake right if
you defend in the big blind you will pay
some rake and population is minus 58. So

[11:31]
some rake and population is minus 58. So
this is definitely an area of attention
and the same imposition pre flop collar
big blind you're losing at minus 81
where you should be -5 or - 44. So this
kind of confirms again that the big
blind is probably where uh you know it
needs some attention especially when we

[11:46]
needs some attention especially when we
now work with 150k hand sample and we go
towards three bet for pots win rate
stats are not going to be very accurate.
However they can still be useful right
also if we look at the next step which
is going to be about variance in the
short-term sample it can give you a good
indication of how hot you've been

[12:01]
indication of how hot you've been
running. It's like one of the most
important things in poker is
consistency, right? The person who shows
up consistently is in the end who's
going to be the biggest winner, right?
And something that throws people off is
because they go with the ups and downs.

[12:16]
because they go with the ups and downs.
So, in my experience, I started to do
this in my CFP as well, give people like
variance reports, basically how hot
they've been running. So, this way when
people were doing very well, they would
kind of, you know, keep their ego in
check. Uh, and when people are doing

[12:30]
check. Uh, and when people are doing
very bad, we could see that, hey,
listen, this is a lot of varian. So, for
you, for example, it shows imposition
prefab caller in a three by pot, you're
losing at minus 283. That's like three
times what roughly three times what an
average population would do. Now, could
it be that, you know, you're not playing

[12:46]
it be that, you know, you're not playing
that spot perfectly? Sure. But are you
going to lose three times as much? Nah,
unlikely, right? Are are you really
three times worse than the population?
And especially three pots, four by pots
over a smallish sample, 150 g hands,

[13:00]
over a smallish sample, 150 g hands,
maybe not the smallest, but it can
definitely give you a good indicator of
like, okay, in three pots, as we can see
here, you've not been running great,
right? All these numbers both in PFR and
P of color, you're not really doing
great. Now, behind that, we can look at
more like uh how things are played, but

[13:17]
more like uh how things are played, but
so far, this is kind of the the big
blind is what I take out of this, right?
That that's kind of confirming. And
that's in three pot. So far you've not
been running great. In former pots,
however, you seem to be outperforming.
So that kind of uh compensates a little

[13:31]
So that kind of uh compensates a little
bit for it. Um then moving on to
variance tab and after that that's kind
of the the wrapping up like kind of the
win rate part and then I quickly want to
reflect with you then see if you have
anything to add to that. Um, again

[13:46]
anything to add to that. Um, again
continuing on like the variance, I think
it's very important even like for
example monthly to to check in like okay
I think it's very nice if you have a
diagnose right if you're losing you kind
of want to know why or if you're winning
you want to know maybe a little bit less
but it's good to know why right have you

[14:01]
but it's good to know why right have you
just been playing well or have you just
been running good um chances are usually
when you're playing when things are
going badly right way worse than normal
uh there is some bad run involved and
the same if you're running better than
normal there's some good run involved.

[14:15]
normal there's some good run involved.
So for example at pre pre flop all wins
uh usually if you if you would go mine
hands over let's say the last six months
last year and you g all the biggest
winners and you look at their pre flop
all win rate I can tell you it's usually
3x of what it's supposed to be. So all

[14:30]
3x of what it's supposed to be. So all
the biggest winners over a small sample
usually run very well in pre flop or
wins. Um so this is again like to keep
your confidence a bit in check to keep
your ego a bit in check. Sure you're
playing better but also you know stay
realistic. Okay. Well, you my my win
rate all in for example was 3x of what

[14:45]
rate all in for example was 3x of what
it should be. Your win rate all in seems
to be fine. Uh nothing like if you look
at GTO 1.1 uh pool 550 taking
consideration because you know all in
big pots they don't have to pay rake. Uh
so you probably want to land somewhere
somewhere in the middle. Uh it seems

[15:01]
somewhere in the middle. Uh it seems
like you know that's fine. Nothing
nothing too crazy here. And here we can
actually see how often you made certain
hands over a short term uh over this
period of time especially when it
becomes a shorter period of time. So
let's say things have not been going
well for like a month or a couple weeks.
It's very good to check. So actually

[15:16]
It's very good to check. So actually
over the sample of 150k hands, you got
dealt ace king and queens a bit less
than you should. And guess what guys,
almost all your winnings in poker come
from ace king plus and queens plus. It's
uh it's less sexy than it sounds, but
this is a very big part of your winning.

[15:30]
this is a very big part of your winning.
So let's say for example over two week
period things have not really been going
your way and you see hey I've not got
dealt premiums and when I or when I got
dealt them my $1 showdown was way lower
or I did not get them in pre flop that's
actually you know it can give you like

[15:45]
actually you know it can give you like
some peace of mind and from a state of
peace of mind it's easier to play good
poker so this is kind of like I kind of
designed this tab because I noticed that
is a has a very big impact on your
performance if we look at how often you
flop the set that seems seems to be

[16:00]
flop the set that seems seems to be
fine. Turn set, you actually turn them a
little bit more often. Your rivet sets a
bit less often. However, if we look at
your $1 at showdown and your win rate,
your win rate is a little bit lower of
what it should be. And actually, we can
see that at your $1 showdown

[16:15]
see that at your $1 showdown
compared to GTO, you're winning at
Showdown definitely less than what it
should be. So, this is also like an
indicator of variance. Yes, you made
your sets, but did you now also win it,
right? Or did you ended up losing? And
it based on the $1 showdown here and
what it should be. You should be winning

[16:30]
what it should be. You should be winning
your sets at showdown more often. Uh
could also be for example that you
didn't make the correct hero faults etc.
Uh but for most for the most part this
is just an indicator of variance. You
made your sets but you were not able to
uh uh to how can I say kind of collect

[16:47]
uh uh to how can I say kind of collect
the winnings because when you had to
turn over your cards you lost, right?
And this kind of basically goes for all
all hand classes. One thing actually I
also wanted to point out that was a
clear indicator of variance in your game
is this is if you if you've three batted

[17:00]
is this is if you if you've three batted
or four batted um
then how often if you have tens to kings
how often you actually flop an over
pair. This is actually especially in a
short term it's a huge indicator of
variance. Let's say you three pocket
queens three times in a row and every
time the flop is ace high that's that's

[17:16]
time the flop is ace high that's that's
going to hurt your or hurt your win rate
over a short sample. Whereas if every
time the flop was 10i, man, you might
you might win three stacks more over a
10k hand sample, right? So that's
actually a huge indicator of variance.
And for you actually, we can see that
you're supposed to flop an over pair

[17:30]
you're supposed to flop an over pair
with this hand around 50% of the time.
You're only at 44k. So a bit you saw an
overcard a bit more often in three and
four pots. Uh you're also your win rate
is way lower. Your $1 showdown is way
lower. Uh which means uh that again when
the when the cards went open, you lost.

[17:46]
the when the cards went open, you lost.
So probably you got cooler here. And
then on the turn, how often how often it
remained an over pair, way less as well.
43% instead of 56%. So you were not able
to and that's also probably where this
win rate comes from, right? Half of the
win rate what it should be in a very

[18:01]
win rate what it should be in a very
important spot to make money in poker.
Um, so this is a great indicator of
variance. You run quite bad in three and
four by pot over pairs. So uh, if you
now you really have something to
complain about. You can say, "Hey, I'm
not just whining. It's the data that can

[18:15]
not just whining. It's the data that can
back this up." Um, so that's kind of uh
it from like a whim rate and variance
perspective. Anything uh you would like
to add or any comment you have so far?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, know it's it's it's cool to see.
Um I think every poker player we sort of

[18:33]
Um I think every poker player we sort of
feel like we're running bad, you know,
to a certain degree. But um and you know
when I think back over over this year
there's there's been periods up and down
but oftentimes we only really pay
attention to the all NEV and the

[18:47]
attention to the all NEV and the
difference we are from from that number
and it's important to realize that you
know that's not the only place that
variance comes from and uh yeah I think
about you know there was
&gt;&gt; a period June July where I was doing
quite well and then August where I got

[19:01]
quite well and then August where I got
destroyed and I think the period in June
July I think I was quite under EV and In
August, I was actually over EV despite
getting destroyed. So, I would guess I'd
ran pretty averageish in this sample.
I'm not going to It looks like I might

[19:16]
I'm not going to It looks like I might
be a little bit more unlucky than than
what I thought, but you know, at the end
of the day, I'm with the way that I'm
playing, I'm sure I'm making mistakes
all over the place. I'm leaving money
off the on the table where if I was
playing optimally or or the best win

[19:32]
playing optimally or or the best win
rate poker that was possible to be
played in my pools, I would be crushing
the game. So, I'm not going to use these
variance numbers as an excuse, but it's
it's obviously very good to to dive in
and give a little bit of a reality check

[19:46]
and give a little bit of a reality check
to to the sample.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, and especially like you said
in that in that one month that things
were going way worse. It's very nice to
have a diagnose. So, it doesn't doesn't
influence your game as much, right?
Obviously, we try to focus on the
controllable variance like you said,

[20:00]
controllable variance like you said,
right? You try to just play good poker,
but it's it's it's very easy for doubt
to start creeping in if you start losing
over a longer period of time. And what I
found from like a mental game
performance perspective having like this
data that can show you uh what's
actually going wrong uh or you know you

[20:17]
actually going wrong uh or you know you
might actually be losing and you look at
this data and like [ __ ] I'm actually
running hot as well right this was
actually like in when I was playing this
cash game world championship I talked
about that last week here on stream uh
at some point also I was looking at I'm
not doing it's not going so well over

[20:30]
not doing it's not going so well over
this period over this week uh but I've
actually been running hot so maybe I
should you know I cannot blame it on
that so I have to really really really
zone in. Uh so from that perspective
actually it can also uh really work. So
yeah that's kind of it for like the
first and how I like to use uh whim

[20:45]
first and how I like to use uh whim
rates. Now I know some a lot of a lot of
people they don't like to work with whim
rates because of the variance but I hope
I kind of um showed that it's just one
piece of the puzzle and it's actually a
great indicator for variance in some
cases. Um so yeah moving on to like uh

[21:01]
cases. Um so yeah moving on to like uh
the other two overview tabs which you
could see more as like a hut, right?
just a very broad overview of your game
and then mainly around as you can see
here the range construction and like
sebat versus seb. So basically mainly
how you construct your ranges um from

[21:17]
how you construct your ranges um from
like the the most global perspective we
can look at it right from from the top
down. So the first thing that I noticed
uh when I was looking at this tab is 541
was a flop. So, you're definitely
fighting. But if we then looked at your

[21:31]
fighting. But if we then looked at your
um at your red line and blue line, like
your red line was not necessarily going
through the roof, which people would
often associate with 541s of flop,
right? So, that's something to pay
attention to. Uh and then if your red
line is not going high, you know, your
blue line should make up for it. And but

[21:46]
blue line should make up for it. And but
that was actually also stagnating. So,
you didn't have like some players have
like a clear blue line or clear red line
problem with you. That was not really
the case because both lines they kind of
ended up breaking even and so you ended
up breaking even, right? So it seems to

[22:00]
up breaking even, right? So it seems to
be that you might usually this for me is
an indicator that it's more of a blue
line problem. I think that's where you
can make uh uh most money uh that you're
now winning pots especially with your
stronger hands that are going to be less
than what they should be. But we will

[22:16]
than what they should be. But we will
get to that later on as well.
Especially, for example, if you look at
your aggression here on the river,
you're in general, you seem to be a
little bit overaggressive. Uh especially
on the river, that means that you're not
uh trapping enough, which is actually
going to be something that I want to

[22:30]
going to be something that I want to
dive into. So, if we now look at uh your
range construction
uh on flop actually looks pretty well in
terms of how often you bet with strong,
how often you uh bet with weak. So, this
is kind of just flop CBAT or flop
balancing. uh we see nothing like out of

[22:47]
balancing. uh we see nothing like out of
the ordinary per se. Uh where later we
will I will get to that in a second. If
you see things coloring green that means
that you're more on the passive side. If
it turns red you're more on the
aggressive side. Um

[23:00]
aggressive side. Um
the reason I use green kind of comes
from my philosophy that I usually use
this in a hut and I also always saw
green as this gives you the green light
or this gives me the green light. And
also I know that many many players might
use blue. it's also perfectly fine. But
that would say that blue line is

[23:16]
that would say that blue line is
associated with passive play and red
line is associated with with aggressive
play. And that I just don't think is
true as just to say, you know, in
certain areas that's true, but I don't
think as a whole that's true. For
example, you're super aggressive, but
you are not winning at red line, right?

[23:30]
you are not winning at red line, right?
So if that statement would be true
alone, uh then you your red line should
go to the roof. My legend should also go
to the roof, but it doesn't. Um,
something else I want to focus on
quickly on the flop before we go to the
turn. I will pick something from the
flop. Some turns on the river is your

[23:45]
flop. Some turns on the river is your
range construction in raising. If we can
look at your flop range, uh, flop race
range, it's 50% strong where it should
be only 36% strong and it should be 57%
weak and you are only 47% weak. So, that
means that you're fast playing a lot of

[24:01]
means that you're fast playing a lot of
your value. That's one. And you're not
including anywhere near enough bluffs.
uh both in position out position as you
can see these numbers are huge
deviations like I said 49 to 36 46 to 37
50 to 36 these are huge gaps like 14%

[24:16]
50 to 36 these are huge gaps like 14%
15% gaps from from theory so for example
we could take a look at this tab single
race pot out position preop color so
this is when you're in the big blind
right which was kind of the first
suspicion that there could be something
wrong here uh we can indeed see again

[24:32]
wrong here uh we can indeed see again
this win rate minus 108 instead of
basically you're losing twice as what
you should. And then if we go to lines,
we can indeed see that your check
raising here is 12% and it should be
14%. So you're you're lacking check

[24:45]
14%. So you're you're lacking check
raises here. Um where actually we can
see that especially versus one-/ird
sizings, you're getting 6% more success
with your check races. So this is just
direct feedback on how often something
is working in your game. So obviously we
could look at, oh, let's look at

[25:01]
could look at, oh, let's look at
population tendencies. Do they overfold
to check race? uh obviously great to
look at but this then gives the feedback
how is my strategy working in game right
which is often missing I hear many play
say people say that like oh yeah I look
at the data but I don't know if it's

[25:15]
at the data but I don't know if it's
working versus me uh well here now you
get feedback basically with with the
success numbers and if we look at the
range construction because then the
first thing is okay I'm under check
raising well then where does this come
from therefore we have and then normally
you would for example click check race

[25:31]
you would for example click check race
uh and then you could see the range
construction structionction here on the
right. Right? But then we have no
benchmarks. So what what is the correct
number? Yeah, I can see that I'm check
raising uh low pair 4% of the time. But
is that correct? Is that more? That's
why we also added it here. And then we

[25:45]
why we also added it here. And then we
can add benchmark next to it. So as you
can see here, two pair plus you're check
raising 70% 69 roughly 70% of the time
it should be 52 which kind of confirms
that you're not slow playing enough. Now
in this sitinuation it's not necessarily

[26:01]
in this sitinuation it's not necessarily
uh I would say a big problem. Um but for
example I will get to the tree by pot
tap in a second as well where the SPR is
lower. Uh there it would indeed be more
of a problem. Whereas if we look at air
pure air you're only check raising half
of the pure air what you should whereas

[26:16]
of the pure air what you should whereas
if we look at the success number
especially versus one/3 you're getting
6% over folds. So, and actually the
times that you did did do it with your
air, this 45 should be 35, you're
getting 10% more success. So, this is
like a deviation from theory. You're

[26:31]
like a deviation from theory. You're
doing something less than theory. Then
the next question is, well, is this
deviation on purpose? Let's say for
example, you've identified that people
underfold to check race. That would be a
good reason not to do it. But we can see
here actually that when you check it is
actually working and on average versus

[26:46]
actually working and on average versus
the population especially at like lower
stakes especially versus a one-/3 Cbat
you're going to get overfold. So
actually your deviation is not playing
in the weakness of the pool it's
actually doing the opposite. So you
actually want to check race way more air
right and then way more also for example
here with low pairs we see at five

[27:00]
here with low pairs we see at five
instead of eight draws we said 23 of 29.
So across the board you're missing
bluffs in your flop check raising game.
Does that make sense? Do you do you say
like, hey, this is definitely something
that I've identified as well or what's

[27:16]
that I've identified as well or what's
kind of maybe maybe also your thoughts
behind uh
&gt;&gt; um yeah, not not not slow playing enough
or fast playing more value in general?
Yeah, I mean I definitely think that um
when I look at my game

[27:32]
when I look at my game
I've I've noticed myself I have a little
bit of a lesser understanding of uh of
big blind play um especially as the out
of position caller whereas I think you
know it's it's easier to study it's

[27:45]
know it's it's easier to study it's
nicer to study your your seb strategy
but when you're in the big blinds it it
sometimes gets a little bit um a little
bit fuzzier a little bit more
complicated so yeah I think
that makes a lot of sense to me that we
see that I'm I'm leaking there and then
yeah when the pool from from just my

[28:02]
yeah when the pool from from just my
experience and I'm sure uh you could you
can see the data as well people do tend
to just default to these small range
seat sizes a lot right and it makes a
lot of sense that we need to be
attacking those and yeah the fact that

[28:16]
attacking those and yeah the fact that
I'm not uh yeah that's this is going to
be like a very quick easy win to to
throw into my game to to be able to uh
to gain some more win rate there. As for
trapping, yeah, I think definitely,

[28:30]
trapping, yeah, I think definitely,
especially as they're out of position,
you know, there's a natural fear that
you don't want them to go bed flop,
check back, turn and you're sitting
there with with top set and you know,
there's whatever seven big blinds in the
pot. it's not not a so there's an urge
to to raise and as you say it might not

[28:46]
to to raise and as you say it might not
necessarily be bad if if people are
are calling too much or or whatever but
yeah I think being a little bit trickier
and a little bit um yeah more more

[29:00]
and a little bit um yeah more more
willing to mix it up in the big blinds
definitely looks like a a good
adjustment for me and
&gt;&gt; yeah actually you mentioned something
you mentioned the tendency of po right
that's very easy to just press that one
third button
Uh and you can actually see that in your
success as well when you check race. If

[29:15]
success as well when you check race. If
you start check racing versus bigger
sizings, you can see the success kind of
plumbering, right? 37 32 because
basically when people start to see that
for half pot or three quarters, you tend
to usually see that that is a little bit
stronger. Um which means that you know

[29:31]
stronger. Um which means that you know
actually we want to kind of actually I
can see your fold numbers. You're
actually under check folding uh to like
this bigger C bets and still check
raising quite a lot. That is mostly
value though. So that's fine. Uh but so
it's a plus mainly that you should
probably add versus the one/irds, right?

[29:45]
probably add versus the one/irds, right?
And I would say that you could probably
even find some more folds versus bigger
sebat sizings. Actually, this is
something that we can actually see here
at uh at our flop defense. Just in
general overview. Um

[30:00]
we can see here
how often you face a certain sizing. Let
me see if that's a general trend. No.
Okay. you do seem to adjust versus uh uh
versus bigger sizings but we can see
here as well the success percentage from
raising versus smaller sizing compared

[30:15]
raising versus smaller sizing compared
to a bigger that's usually you will see
that that's going to be less so
something to point out on one thing
actually I wanted to add is let's say
for example in terms of the slow playing
let's say we go to three pots uh and we
look at for example your race strategy

[30:31]
look at for example your race strategy
um no three pots in position prefab
caller
we can see here that for example your
flop race strategy. Where are we here?
Race. So again, you're raising for
example two pair plus uh double the

[30:45]
example two pair plus uh double the
amount of the time and especially I saw
like some hands here. Let's say you have
uh a set let's say let's say for example
something like this
like at a low SPR dry board. There's

[31:01]
like at a low SPR dry board. There's
just not a lot of reason to start
raising straight away with strong hands.
So like in single race pots, obviously
we we want a check race to get more
money in. Uh but especially in three
pots, there's way less of a need to do a
lot of fast playing. So that's

[31:16]
lot of fast playing. So that's
definitely something uh a point of
attention that I would uh uh same here
with, for example, this this queen seven
that I'm seeing here.
Yeah, just just just let him let let him

[31:30]
Yeah, just just just let him let let him
do his thing, right? Like especially
when also you're in position so he can
just check towards you. you can still
build a pot. So that's definitely an
area that I would say okay uh be careful
then and then maybe another point
actually I didn't see if that's true uh
but if we go to your flop check race and

[31:46]
but if we go to your flop check race and
let's say two pair plus
uh I know people cannot see now the hand
I will have to uh uh point that out but
maybe there's like certain hands for
example actually something like this
it's very dry as well where is it

[32:03]
it's very dry as well where is it
you know I wouldn't mind letting someone
catch up here a little bit and then
either go for uh a turn check raise or
river check race versus bat check bat
something along those lines. Um, and I'm

[32:16]
something along those lines. Um, and I'm
trying to see if maybe you're check
raising,
this is maybe not the best example,
but on boards like this, like very
connected boards, for example, a hand
like jack eight or something. Uh, that
is sort of strong, but it's not really

[32:32]
is sort of strong, but it's not really
strong, right? So, for example, I would
much rather check race queen 10 here or
queen nine than a hand like jack eight.
Um, so I don't know if that's the case.
Like, this is just a random hand. I just
saw the texture. Uh, but then that's
something if the board is either super

[32:45]
something if the board is either super
dry like the A73i, I wouldn't mind slow
playing. And I would I wouldn't even
call it slow playing, but it's more that
I wouldn't check raise a a bat to pair
on a very wet board, for example.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, makes a lot of sense. And yeah,
especially on the dry boards where you

[33:00]
especially on the dry boards where you
have the set or you have the top two
pair, it's like there's not a turn that
I'm scared of, right? So,
&gt;&gt; it makes a lot of sense in that
situation to
&gt;&gt; to go h to go a little bit slower. And
then yeah, this queen jacket example, it
was yeah, your jacket is on a lot of

[33:16]
was yeah, your jacket is on a lot of
turns and rivers is going to not be
something that you're going to want to
put your stack in with. So it would make
more sense, you know, maybe raise uh,
you know, either like a queen that's got
some like a king queen type of hand
that's going to perhaps, you know,

[33:32]
that's going to perhaps, you know,
there's not if the overcard comes, it
actually improves the hand or if the 10
comes, it gives you a straight draw or
something like your your equity is a
little bit more robust in that scenario.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So it's kind of the relative
versus absolute strength that uh you

[33:46]
versus absolute strength that uh you
know if you have the tendency to just
pass play a lot maybe you kind of
consider two pair there a strong board a
strong hand. So then if we look at the
turn uh there's actually like the turn
check the raising game here on the turn
is actually the same the same point as

[34:01]
is actually the same the same point as
on the flop. But I made actually wanted
to now zoom in on the turn. We can see
your betting range is way too strong. So
again, like if you look at how often
that's strong, it's 55 instead of 42.
And how often it's weak, it's only 35
instead of 50. So you're again missing

[34:16]
instead of 50. So you're again missing
bluffs on the turn by a lot, 15%, and
you're betting way too much strong hands
on the turn. Now again, like the
definition of strong here is important.
Um, so let's say for example, we go to
single race pots in position PFR lines

[34:33]
single race pots in position PFR lines
and we go to turn Cbetting. We see that
in general you do little turn C betting
and there again we can see that two pair
plus uh but most most importantly and
that's actually the one that I think is
the leak is top pair over pair so one

[34:47]
the leak is top pair over pair so one
usually like one street value type of
hands that people like to play bat bat
check way too often kind of to avoid a
river decision that's usually kind of
kind of what's going on right two pair

[35:01]
kind of what's going on right two pair
plus again that could be that uh you're
not really understanding like the
relative versus absolute hand strength.
You're not spotting that. So again like
the queen jack eight that I had like
queen 10 would for example always be a
barrel and I had like jack eight could
for example be a check. So that's more

[35:15]
for example be a check. So that's more
like what I would say in the two pair
region. Normally in position in this
spot we don't really do slow playing in
terms of actual slow playing. Right? If
we slow play a hand like two pair it's
just because it's a relatively weak hand
compared to how wet the board is. Um but

[35:32]
compared to how wet the board is. Um but
for example if we look at so we look at
bat bat and we look at let's say for
example a middle pair that's maybe a
good example
and
let's say this hand I think this

[35:46]
let's say this hand I think this
probably a good example
we open 10 get a call in the big blind
flop comes check 65 we see bet one/3
villain calls and the turn is a five and
he doesn't lead this what what's kind of

[36:02]
he doesn't lead this what what's kind of
your your thought process here in terms
of uh coming to a turnbo conclusion?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, uh, first off, I probably
nowadays would play this board a little
bit more polar and would check back more

[36:15]
bit more polar and would check back more
often on the flop, but I think as played
on this turn, um, yeah, at these stakes,
there are still a lot of players that
just don't play dons, so therefore
they're going to be a little bit maybe
stronger than they should be on this
turn because I imagine solver is

[36:31]
turn because I imagine solver is
supposed to play a lot of dons. Um,
but yeah, I think now I'd be more
inclined to go a little bit mergier and
do a higher frequency like third pot
sort of size. Um, whereas I think for

[36:46]
sort of size. Um, whereas I think for
most of this sample I was leaning
towards thinking, okay, I'm going to
over bet on the turn a lot. So
therefore, I'm checking my my middling
sort of hands. Um, but yeah, this yeah,
as player, I feel like this is one that

[37:00]
as player, I feel like this is one that
you could probably go either way. My
instinct right now as I look at it is to
check. But um yeah, it's uh
yeah, I can see I can see arguments for
for both, right? Because on this board,
you're you're going to have the big

[37:15]
you're you're going to have the big
blind's going to have a six. They're
going to have hands like pocket sevens,
pocket eights, even pocket fours, ace
highs that are going to be able to be
put in a tough spot against a a smaller
barrel. So, um, yeah, I think it, yeah,
with this I think you could probably bet

[37:30]
with this I think you could probably bet
this hand, but I don't think I could do
it for this size. It seems a little bit
weird to me looking at it now. But
&gt;&gt; I think I think actually sizing wise, I
would probably just play this size. Just
top of my head. I would think that, for
example, a hand like sevens, for
example, getting value of a six. Uh, I

[37:47]
example, getting value of a six. Uh, I
think like sevens and tens is a very big
difference here. Sevens, for example,
the the folding range will have more
equity versus seven. Think of a head
like ace 9. If you have 10, you don't
mind keeping ace9 in. River is a nine.
You can actually maybe he blocks, you
can make a small raise or he checks, you

[38:01]
can make a small raise or he checks, you
can make a nice bet check bet.
Obviously, when you have sevens, you
don't you you prefer a nine to fold.
Also, if this hand goes check check and
he bets the river, a lot of his bluffs
are going to come from like 78 79. Uh
so, you know, you're not blocking any of
the bluffs. Uh but in general to kind of

[38:17]
the bluffs. Uh but in general to kind of
betting too much too straight hands on
the turn. That seems to be like kind of
the main the main leak I would say. And
this is kind of where
&gt;&gt; you're lacking blue line. You're putting
a hand that's supposed to make his money

[38:30]
a hand that's supposed to make his money
from blue line from checking back
letting villain catch up with ace9 or
letting him bluff with 79. You're you're
putting that hand into a red line
strategy, right? Whereas this this is
clearly a blue line blue line type of
situation. Same with the with this hand
for example that I saw here. 96 on quite

[38:48]
for example that I saw here. 96 on quite
a coordinated board. I would say
actually flop is
maybe this guy's a recreational. I don't
know. Um but this is this is quite quite
thin already. We're we're we're going to
get called by hands that have a lot of

[39:01]
get called by hands that have a lot of
equity or that already have us beat,
right? Jack six, king six, A6, you name
it. Um so yeah, these are like just
randomly two hands that I saw here in
the database. Uh what's this?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You see a lot of people in the in

[39:15]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You see a lot of people in the in
the world, they
&gt;&gt; they check or they they miss a bet
because they're scared. This is this is
like betting because I'm scared.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. And and scared of what's
supposed to come on the river, right? At
least if you now just bet tens again in
the turn. Actually, this is kind of that

[39:30]
the turn. Actually, this is kind of that
example with sevens that I kind of gave
earlier, but here the position is a bit
tighter. So seven, you know, he has now
more eights, nines himself compared to
bottom versus big blind. So I would
again say that this is uh probably just
a check in these positions and let him
bluff the river. So this is where this

[39:45]
bluff the river. So this is where this
will be a note where I think you can
definitely increase your blue line. Um
then for example um turn if we go to for
example another note that actually not
uh uh not trapping is actually a problem

[40:02]
uh uh not trapping is actually a problem
is for example yeah let's go again to uh
to the big blind defense right as we
kind of concluded that that's probably
where the issue is um this one. So flop
goes check check and you have the

[40:15]
goes check check and you have the
opportunity to probe the turn. We see
that you're at 87. Your two pair plus
bets 87% of the time where it should
only bet 62% of the time. So again, way
too much uh betting yourself with two
pair plus and especially when you're out
of position in the big blind on as well

[40:31]
of position in the big blind on as well
turn or river. You can actually often
make way more money by check raising
your your top of range than betting them
out to sell. So here for example top
pair over pair like the 52 versus 45.
This is perfect like a one pair hand.

[40:45]
This is perfect like a one pair hand.
you kind of want to just put the money
in yourself. You your hand is not strong
enough to check race. But the two pair
plus region, so like your very strong
hands, they can often make way more
money by taking an alternative line than
just betting themselves. So in this
case, it would be check raising versus
delay. Or let's say we go and let me see

[41:01]
delay. Or let's say we go and let me see
the line. Check all check um check call
check raise for example. That would be a
good one. Check all check bet. We can
indeed see that two pair plus actually
here so far 72 a little bit a little bit

[41:16]
here so far 72 a little bit a little bit
too often but the general trend would be
the same like okay I have top of range
how can I get the most amount of money
in when we're out of position that could
actually also be check raising same as
for example if we are the PFR let's say
small bet versus big blind and we look

[41:30]
small bet versus big blind and we look
at your flop uh turn check race strategy
it's basically non-existent so you see
that flop uh check turn and we can
indeed barreling again 82
um uh two pair plus instead of 64. So a

[41:45]
um uh two pair plus instead of 64. So a
lot of hands that for example see bet
flop and that we I don't know if you do
if you do a lot of over betting here.
Okay, you do a reasonable amount of over
betting. I personally don't really do a
lot of over betting small and first big
blind and kind of the hands that over
bet I move to a check race actually

[42:00]
bet I move to a check race actually
myself. So I kind of bet more closer to
like three quarters of pot and when my
hand actually wants to go bigger I
actually move that hand to a check race.
That's actually going to be way more
efficient. You can get way more money in
the pot than an overb yourself if that
makes sense. So, these are like some
spots where you're you're kind of I

[42:17]
spots where you're you're kind of I
don't want to necessarily say
misplaying, but it's kind of a
suboptimal way. You think strong hand,
let's put money in the pot, but you can
actually get more money in the pot by
checking either on the turn or on the
river. And then, especially on the
river, you can sometimes check jam a

[42:31]
river, you can sometimes check jam a
hand that you would otherwise just over
bet yourself and that actually loses a
lot of money. I know that usually
actually a lot of focus in poker goes to
hero cost spots, plus spots, you know,
all these this type of thing, but
misplaying your value in terms of not

[42:45]
misplaying your value in terms of not
getting the most out of your value
hands. This is actually huge in terms of
if I would say leaks. Uh finding it's
also a bit harder to detect. Um now with
this range construction breakdown, it's
a bit easier already. Um but these are
definitely spots where you can make a

[43:01]
definitely spots where you can make a
lot more money with top of your range.
This is also we saw your blue line not
really picking up. That's for that
reason. But in the same time, we did see
that people
um we do actually see that people do a
lot of overfolding on turns, right? So

[43:15]
lot of overfolding on turns, right? So
your betting range was too strong and
not weak enough. Whereas if we go to
turn on average uh when you bet you can
see that you're betting 35% on average
on the turn, which is normal compared to
GTO, but your success is 49 with your
bets where it should be 41. So this is a

[43:31]
bets where it should be 41. So this is a
general trend of just massive
overfolding of the pool and what you're
doing actually you're creating a betting
range that's way too strong. Okay. So
this actually again it doesn't play in
the weakness of the pool. It's the
opposite. The pool kind of exploits you
naturally which is usually the worst

[43:46]
naturally which is usually the worst
thing that that kind of can happen. Um
so that's definitely something uh to
point out on like one note if we go back
to your big blind game right that was
very kind of I think what's going to be
most important that stabbing strategy.
Uh you can also see this if you do MDA

[44:01]
Uh you can also see this if you do MDA
of like low stakes usually the checkback
range is too weak and then for people
overfall to probes feedback in your game
specifically you're getting 48% success
with your turn probe where it should be
35. So you're getting uh 13% overfold

[44:16]
35. So you're getting uh 13% overfold
with the stab
&gt;&gt; and you're under under stabbing with air
28 versus 34.
&gt;&gt; So again like definitely a point of
point of intention. So slow play more
the top of your range and bet more air

[44:30]
the top of your range and bet more air
and then naturally actually you you your
range right if we how we started here
right where we went to just to like the
overview and we saw this range breakdown
you want to get this closer to GTO
numbers
if that makes sense.
&gt;&gt; Yeah for sure.

[44:45]
&gt;&gt; Yeah for sure.
&gt;&gt; Um
&gt;&gt; yeah it strikes me as another like fear
sort of thing right you're you're out of
possession and you're the turn with a
good hand. It's like
it there's there's an urge you to bet
because you don't want it to go check
check and you've got a good hand and the

[45:01]
check and you've got a good hand and the
river is there's you're in a small pot
but in reality in that spot people do
tend to just stab quite often right if
you check to them or if you've you've
shown weakness people people tend to
stab and then you've got a check raise
opportunity and you actually get more

[45:15]
opportunity and you actually get more
money in the pot. So
&gt;&gt; yeah, that's the thing, right? Because
yes, sure, you're going to miss it more
often than if you bet yourself, but the
times that you hit it, you suddenly make
you can make three times more money.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.
&gt;&gt; Right. So that's kind of the the the the
correction there. Um

[45:32]
correction there. Um
let me see. Then I had one point to add
here on the river. Um and this I think
is another very big issue in your game.
Um river river hero calling sounds
familiar?

[45:45]
familiar?
Yes,
&gt;&gt; usually usually when I say this, people
know people know that they have a
problem.
&gt;&gt; And that's the fascinating thing, right?
A lot of people out here maybe also now
listening, they know they have a
problem. You know, they they make the
bluff when they know they shouldn't make

[46:00]
bluff when they know they shouldn't make
the bluff. They make the call when they
know they shouldn't make the call,
right? And we can do a database review
here and it doesn't fix the problem.
That's also why in in the program,
right, we've identified the drawer in
the camp. I tend to be too sticky on the
river. Uh why is that and how do we fix
it? Right? That's something that just

[46:15]
it? Right? That's something that just
handinote will not show you. So that's
kind of what I go deeper into the in the
leak buster, right? This is just the
analyze phase and after that I think we
talked briefly in the beginning as well.
If you go through all these stats, you
will find hundreds of leaks, right? I
also find hundreds of leaks. How do we

[46:30]
also find hundreds of leaks. How do we
prioritize that? And then how do we
diagnose what's the problem? How do we
fix it? Right? So there's more steps uh
than just hey I'm a station. Okay, you
shouldn't station anymore. Good luck.
You probably tried that, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I've had the the post-it

[46:45]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I've had the the post-it
note on the monitor like just fold fold
river.
&gt;&gt; I love it. Post-it notes.
&gt;&gt; Easier said than done.
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly right. It's uh you're
you're trying to manage manage symptoms
and not co and not fix the root cause.

[47:00]
and not co and not fix the root cause.
Uh so this is something that actually we
help you with. So and you also arrive to
the river actually already with a weaker
range. That's even more concerning. So
you're underfolding the river which is
in some spots actually is good. Uh but
in your game, as we will see in a
second, it's more I like to call more

[47:15]
second, it's more I like to call more
emotional bluff catching than rational
bluff catching. Um
and like I said, it's an extra problem
if I look at the amount of fast playing
that you already did and in some lines
some overfalling that you already did on
earlier street. So then to still fold at
a very low percentage, yeah, that's a

[47:31]
a very low percentage, yeah, that's a
problem. Now, in some spots actually
hero calling is good and very effective
and want to continue doing that. Uh but
there's a specific area. You might
already know it when you're in the big
blind maybe. Uh and in position uh in
position goes crazy. Uh we probably have

[47:45]
position goes crazy. Uh we probably have
to hit that full button a little bit
more uh little bit more often. Um
&gt;&gt; yeah.
&gt;&gt; So that's actually something that for
example if we go to again that note that
I kind of suspected was your problem. If
I look at river fold, we can see that

[48:00]
I look at river fold, we can see that
you're folding 48 on the river. It
should be 57. Um, so you're you're
folding flop normal, but taking in
consideration that you're already doing
way more fast playing, right? And then
you're underfolding turn and then you're
underfolding river again. Now, versus

[48:15]
underfolding river again. Now, versus
the button, and that's why I actually
have this breakdown versus the button,
you know, a wider range. Generally, when
people have a wider range, it's easier
for them to overbluff. So therefore,
it's it can't be it can be too bad to be
a station in a wide spot. That's kind of
usually my model, right?

[48:30]
usually my model, right?
uh but especially also versus uh versus
earlier position. Big one versus early
for example the fold 50 and bigger for
scholar fold 44. H these these are going
to be issues. These are not really going
to be calls uh that are going to make
you a money and we can see here as well

[48:45]
you a money and we can see here as well
your river call win is 36 where it
should be 41. Uh so your your calls
they're they're not really performing.
Um
so that's actually a point of attention
but we will get back to that when we
look at the river the river

[49:00]
look at the river the river
specifically.
Uh the next point where we can actually
look at is like a breakdown of still
we're at like an overview right general
overview. I keep linking it already back
to like specific spots. That's like
usually how I like to look at it because
if you go straight only into specific

[49:16]
if you go straight only into specific
spots even with 150k sample it's quite
very insensitive. Whereas I feel like
just general flop turn overviews to kind
of start getting information there and
then looking at the line itself to
either conform or see okay well if
that's true how would that look in this

[49:30]
that's true how would that look in this
specific spot for example then we can
look at the hands and then we can kind
of find uh link link the two together in
a way whereas if you would just look at
okay single spot in position it's harder
to find the pattern basically I find
these general overview tabs way more
efficient um so this like the last step

[49:46]
efficient um so this like the last step
in the overview is kind of how you
construct betting We already talked
briefly that before the call that you
said that you changed something. So we
can actually see that your sizing scheme
on flop uh it's actually pretty GTO. So
congrats there in terms of how often you
bet 1/3 often you bet uh 3/4 bigger etc.

[50:03]
bet 1/3 often you bet uh 3/4 bigger etc.
Um we can see that your bluffing game is
mainly like the over bets you you you
like to bluff there and it's actually uh
it's actually also very very effective.
Um we will get to that in a second as

[50:16]
Um we will get to that in a second as
well. So I wouldn't necessarily change
too much. This though is a point of
attention. So if we look at versus bet
sizing, we can see that specifically
when people overb
you start to call more. What's going on
there? It's supposed to be the opposite.

[50:31]
there? It's supposed to be the opposite.
When people bet less, you call more.
When people bet bigger, you you fold
less. So what's going on here then?
&gt;&gt; Well, it's cuz I'm always bluffing in
the over bet. So therefore, I just
assume everyone else is. But uh
&gt;&gt; the classic projection.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. I mean, I I think yeah,

[50:46]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. I mean, I I think yeah,
there it's just definitely a an element
of it is just theoretical
misunderstanding of the spots that, you
know, you have to be okay with folding
plenty of hands. Another level of it is
the data. It does seem to say that when
people bet big, they usually just have

[51:01]
people bet big, they usually just have
it. So, I should just listen to that and
and fold it more. I think it's it's that
situation where if somebody jams on me
on the river, they're usually repping
such a narrow range and it's, you know,
and maybe emotionally I just want to

[51:15]
and maybe emotionally I just want to
call to to to be cool to have a fancy
play to be like, you know, this look at
how how I've owned the guy or whatever
when he was repping a set and he
actually had the the pair that he's
turned into a bluff. Like those moments
feel good. So there's probably a bit of

[51:31]
feel good. So there's probably a bit of
just uh confirmation bias in the times
that it's felt good to do that, but the
reality is these are not good spots to
to station people down. So yeah, I I
think uh more and more it's just going
to be studying the the hands where that

[51:45]
to be studying the the hands where that
happens and and slowly integrate that.
But also just just listen to listen to
the data and not my my feelings that I
that I just want to call, you know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And again like this very rational,
right? Listen to the data and not my
feelings. Whereas the problem is if you
get into those situations, you don't
have access to your rational thoughts.

[52:01]
have access to your rational thoughts.
It's purely emotional. Your emotions
take over. This is actually this part
was actually one of the reasons why this
program delayed a little bit. Uh you
know like we first had this tool and I
said okay I don't want to just release
this tool. Sure I think it's better than
what's out there on the market but I

[52:16]
what's out there on the market but I
want to really bring something that's
that really helps people. So that's why
I built kind of the course content
around it. And then this part, diagnose
and fix someone's leak is like, "Oh,
well, this is actually a little bit
harder than I thought." So, also I

[52:31]
harder than I thought." So, also I
teamed up a lot with with my co-host
Adam. Adam helped me a lot in this
section as well, right? Because what
what you're describing uh and this is
how usually people like to fix it. Oh,
yeah. I I'm going to study the data
again. Oh, indeed. The data sets that
they're under bluffing and then next

[52:45]
they're under bluffing and then next
time you're in the spot, you still press
call. So, it's not it's not a knowledge
mistake. You know, right? you know, so
we cannot fix it with knowledge. Then
how do we fix it, right? So it's it's
usually it's either a focus or
engagement mistake or it's a mental game
mistake. That's kind of the three errors

[53:01]
mistake. That's kind of the three errors
that I kind of concluded in the end
where we can make mistakes. We can make
mistakes because there's a lack of
knowledge. Uh we can make mistake
because there's a lack of focus and
engagement, right? We kind of know it.
It's also not necessarily meant to
problem, but we're just not engaged
enough to execute or it's simply a

[53:15]
enough to execute or it's simply a
mental game problem. We know it. We know
we shouldn't do it, but we keep on doing
it. Uh that part ended up taking a
little bit longer uh to fix. Um but
there I think is is is where the most
value is especially in spots to narrow
this down where people show continuous

[53:32]
this down where people show continuous
aggression. So think bad bet lines and
that kind of seems in line right when
people bat bigger so go overbat or they
show a lot of interest and aggression
that's when you have the urge to fight
back the most. Now, I can already tell
you this is something that you can try

[53:46]
you this is something that you can try
to manage or you can post as much
post-it notes on your screen as
possible. It's not gonna it's not gonna
uh it's not going to resolve like that.
Um uh so yeah, in the in the league
buster program for people listening, if
you want to get rid of these these

[54:00]
you want to get rid of these these
mistakes, so the mistakes that you know
that you have, and I've I've done so
many database reviews and one-on-one
coaching session, they say, "Well, are
you aware of this?" Say, "Yeah, I know."
Uh and then I say, "Okay, yeah, well
then then now what?" Right? Uh so that's
kind of the question that I wanted to uh

[54:15]
kind of the question that I wanted to uh
to answer and I believe we did a good
job. Um so especially like I said in
continuous aggression if you look at
your call call win. So this is any spot
where people do on the flop whatever but
on the turn they bet and on the river
they bet again you can see that that's
specifically and then specifically again

[54:30]
specifically and then specifically again
out of position where you're only
winning 35 or should be winning 45. So
again like that big blind defense that's
I think like your your main area where
where things go wrong when you're in
position. That's usually for example
when you big versus small blind aka the
range is way wider aka people bluff on

[54:46]
range is way wider aka people bluff on
average more therefore calling down is
actually not that bad. So it's not and
this is then something that also goes
off and wrong then people like okay I
should be less of a station but you have
to be very specific with the directions
you give your mind if you just tell your
mind I have to be less of a station it

[55:00]
mind I have to be less of a station it
starts to just randomly fold everywhere
no there's certain spots where you
actually want to be a station and
there's certain spots where you don't
want to be station right so it's their
ability to process the information
correctly and rationally and then make
good in-game decisions that's kind of

[55:15]
good in-game decisions that's kind of
what separates the best from the rest
sure they're better players
But it's just their ability to see spots
as they are, right? Whereas if you get
into a spot like that, there's all types
of things going on that have nothing to
do with actually getting to the right
conclusion in the hand, right? And
that's kind of what separates the best

[55:31]
that's kind of what separates the best
uh from the rest. So yeah, this this
hero calling um yeah, definitely is is
going to be one of the one of the bigger
issues.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. Yeah. So it makes a lot
of sense especially and we saw before I

[55:46]
of sense especially and we saw before I
was losing more to the early positions
and losing as the three bet in position
caller and things like that. It might be
that I'm you know these spots where
players are tight. I'm particularly
feeling like I need to to call down and
uh you know these are these are not just

[56:02]
uh you know these are these are not just
just a priority. These are these are
strong ranges and also, you know, just
data wise, people tend to to play in a
strong put their hands in the in the
they're strong hands in the in the
aggressive lines. So, yeah, these are

[56:15]
aggressive lines. So, yeah, these are
not good spots to call, but you know,
the blind first blinds when they have
lots of hands available to bluff and,
you know, they just want to win the pot,
then then you can go ahead and station
down. But
&gt;&gt; yeah, or or you know, they just throw a
little check check bat line or bet check

[56:30]
little check check bat line or bet check
bat line, something along those lines.
But those are usually the smaller pots
and that's that's kind of the thing with
you probably and many players have this
uh their level of engagement is not the
same. There's something about bigger
pots, overbats, triple barrels, people
putting a lot of aggression in you that

[56:46]
putting a lot of aggression in you that
turns that turn something on. There's
there's a consistent pattern here that
you're going to have to break. Um and
you're going to have to understand
what's happening on a deeper level,
right? you're going to really have to
understand, okay, what's going on
physiologically, not only in my brain,

[57:00]
physiologically, not only in my brain,
but also what's going on in my body
because that's in the end what takes
over. Your body is taking over. You have
no you no longer have access to that
part of your brain that knows the data
says that this spot is under bluff
because if you would have, you would not
call, right? Um, so yeah, I teach you I
teach everyone uh if you want to

[57:16]
teach everyone uh if you want to
overcome this, I teach exactly how to do
it in the program. I just wanted to to
to show that you can see for example if
you make uh um hero calls. So this is
any hero call versus versus sizing.
Let's to isolate that. So we already

[57:31]
Let's to isolate that. So we already
concluded like versus continuous
aggression the hero calls are not going
that well. Whereas versus broken
aggression is actually not that bad. But
if you look at your action profit uh so
this is all your hero calls on the river

[57:45]
this is all your hero calls on the river
uh where they went all in. You lost
minus 7 big blinds. uh big overbats, two
samples. These over bets, you're losing
minus 23 big blinds. The other overbats,
minus 10 big blinds. Smaller overbats,
minus eight big blinds. These are a lot

[58:00]
minus eight big blinds. These are a lot
of big blinds. So, if we can just fix
this this hero call leak on the river,
you're saving a lot of uh a lot of
money. So, big upsizing 12 and then
three quarters still minus three. So,
hero calling still not going great. And
then when we go lower 60 to 70% pots,

[58:15]
then when we go lower 60 to 70% pots,
that's when you start to make money
versus half pot, you're making money
versus one/ird, you're making money
versus very small, you're making money.
It's like the per perfect evidence is
right here in terms of feedback how how
you've been doing. So imagine we could
just actually I used to do this
sometimes with with one student of mine.

[58:30]
sometimes with with one student of mine.
I would go to his database and I would
take out all the puns and then I would
send it back to him and said, "What do
you think of this graph?" It's like,
"Oh, it is amazing. Great work." Yeah, I
just took off all your punts. So you
don't have to your problem is not
strategically. You just have to stop
punting, right? Uh so it's kind of the

[58:47]
punting, right? Uh so it's kind of the
same here if if you would not have made
all these big hero calls. Um so in terms
of helping to prioritize what's your
what's your biggest priority, it's going
to be these the these these river hero
calls and really understanding what goes
on that makes you make these calls,

[59:01]
on that makes you make these calls,
right? And this is not something uh like
oh I give you a data point in MDA that
they, you know, that's a quick fix.
There's no quick fix for this that that
I can tell you. It's a process. Uh but
it's definitely fixable if uh if you're
willing to go uh down that route. So

[59:16]
willing to go uh down that route. So
this is kind of uh it for uh kind of the
general overview. The next point we then
have is what you're probably what people
what everyone is used to is pre flop.
Actually I already took a look at your
pre flop game. I would say not much to
note here. Just quickly for the viewers

[59:31]
note here. Just quickly for the viewers
some points that are maybe different
than what you're used to. Um we can see
here how often again like from a
performance perspective. So how often
you made the race then how often you
face the three bet and how often your
steel was success right so you want to

[59:45]
steel was success right so you want to
in an ideal world especially when you go
wider which you are going like in the
button and the small blind you're
stealing wider than you quote quote
should you want then there to be more
success and less three bets and we can
see indeed on the button that you have
4% less three bets um and also four 4%

[1:00:04]
4% less three bets um and also four 4%
less success so these two kind of
balance each other out um but in general
if you make a losser button open. If you
can see a flop, they make money. If you
look at if you would filter now, go to a

[1:00:15]
look at if you would filter now, go to a
holder manager, you would filter them
bottom of your range, you open and you
didn't face a three bet, meaning that
you got to realize at least a part of
your equity. All these hands make money.
So, your wider button opens, they don't
get they don't get high three bets. Keep
doing those. You could even push it a
little bit more if we fix some of the

[1:00:31]
little bit more if we fix some of the
postup stuff we talked about. Uh same
with small blind. Small blind, you're
getting more folds and less three bets.
So, you're already overdoing it. keep on
pounding on these spots and on the right
players. Um then we have like the versus
open tab uh in terms of um how often

[1:00:48]
open tab uh in terms of um how often
you're defending. There's a small bug
here actually which is aware we're now
at version 1.6 1.7 is already almost
going out. So basically what we do is
every month based on also people that
are in the discord that using the

[1:01:00]
are in the discord that using the
program like there's many stats guys it
there it's almost impossible to have
them all perfect straight away. Uh so we
are every month we kind of go through
all the feedback and things that we
found and then we update them because we
saw that these three bet success numbers
for example it says zero. It's obviously
not zero. Uh so this actually something

[1:01:16]
not zero. Uh so this actually something
that we already noticed so that's on the
list and then next month we bring out
the update so it's fixed. But in terms
of like big blind defense everything was
perfectly fine. Uh the only thing that I
found there was one point of attention
pre flop. If we look at the facing three

[1:01:31]
pre flop. If we look at the facing three
bets. So this is shows again
performance, how often you face three
bets, uh how often you're four betting
and how often the four bets are
successful. And we can see that your
four bet bluffs um they do well 2% more
than GTO. But specifically in position

[1:01:47]
than GTO. But specifically in position
versus big blind, which is something
actually that you're doing a lot. You're
for bluffing uh quite a lot. Um but for
big blind, it is something that you will
see as well. It's just not very
effective. Uh so you're actually getting
way less folds than you should for his
big blind because on average it's the

[1:02:01]
big blind because on average it's the
big blind three bet people are just not
po polar enough and they're just strong.
It's just too easy even though everyone
know this is again it's something
everyone here knows it by now right. Uh
but it's again it's like every time it's
just too easy to press the call button.

[1:02:15]
just too easy to press the call button.
It's a it's a leak that everyone knows
but it's still not fixed. Why not?
Because people don't know how to fix
their leaks. They are aware of a leak
which is not the same as knowing.
Knowing I like to say knowing is when
awareness survives pressure right so you
are aware that the that for example the

[1:02:31]
are aware that the that for example the
population on the blast the river but
you don't know it because it doesn't
survive the pressure of the in of the of
the moment right so we have to bridge
the gap between becoming aware which is
what hand toote helps you with to
actually knowing and that's kind of

[1:02:46]
actually knowing and that's kind of
where what we do in with the league
buster program we kind of close that gap
so like all your for bluffs all works
fine you're overdoing it versus the big
blind which is actually not
incentivized. So again like a deviation
from theory you're doing something too
much. If the population is overfalling

[1:03:01]
much. If the population is overfalling
great keep on doing it like your button
ste small blind steals right you're
doing it too much and it's very
effective but in this case cut out four
by bluffing versus big blind and then
you're good it's a very easy uh easy
practical thing like I said other than
that your pre flop game very solid just

[1:03:17]
that your pre flop game very solid just
yeah not much to add here.
&gt;&gt; Any comments? Pre flop was something.
Yeah, pre flop was something that I I
put a good amount of time into. I made
myself some
&gt;&gt; some charts and did some drilling and
flashcards and all that kind of stuff.

[1:03:31]
flashcards and all that kind of stuff.
So, I feel like at least my knowledge of
the the most common pre flop spots in
terms of GTO is uh is pretty good. I
would say above average for for the pool
from what I've seen. But
&gt;&gt; I still need to be more flexible, right?

[1:03:46]
&gt;&gt; I still need to be more flexible, right?
And I think it's easy to be flexible
in some ways. you know, opening wider on
the button, opening wider the small
blind, that's like really fun because
people don't three bet enough, but the
flip side of that, as you say, is
because they don't three bet enough, you

[1:04:01]
because they don't three bet enough, you
have to actually overfold when they do
three bet, and that's not as fun. So,
&gt;&gt; so, so it's again kind of kind of the
fight just like with the facing over
bets, facing barrels, when someone
fights back, something gets triggered in
you that you want to fight back more.

[1:04:16]
you that you want to fight back more.
Whereas yeah, how I approach poker and
not to be narcissistic but I think this
is a very efficient way Sunzu approved
you try to avoid what is strong and
strike at what's weak. So in poker
basically your job is to identify when

[1:04:30]
basically your job is to identify when
people are too strong that's when you
you know you you you take a step back
and when people are too weak you start
pounding on them. Whereas a lot of
people have this problem that they get
triggered by people showing aggression,
showing strength, and they want to fight

[1:04:45]
showing strength, and they want to fight
that. And that's actually the opposite
of what you should want to do.
&gt;&gt; Um,
&gt;&gt; y
I was just going to say for
button verse pipeline, for example,
&gt;&gt; it's for bluffing is not even it's

[1:05:00]
&gt;&gt; it's for bluffing is not even it's
something I studied and it's something
that I wasn't doing before and it's
something that a lot of people don't do.
So, it makes it feels like it's a
skillful play because I've spent time,
you know, learning what hands are good
to do that with. And it feels like I
should get to use that knowledge, but

[1:05:15]
should get to use that knowledge, but
you only get to use it in the right
situation against someone that's
actually wellstied. If someone's not
well studied and they have a leak, the
way to exploit that leak is just to to
do to take the the boring play, you
know, and uh and just fold. So, that's
that's something to that that I that I

[1:05:32]
that's something to that that I that I
need to deal with as well, for sure. I
was going to say this is something
actually that new school players or like
newer generations kind of sometimes miss
but we are I mean you're not new not old
I think you said 10 years like I've
already been in poker basically a

[1:05:45]
already been in poker basically a
dinosaur by now like 18 years or
something. Uh
&gt;&gt; yeah.
&gt;&gt; So in the past for example if you wanted
to for bet bluff someone you would look
at okay well does he fold to for bet.
Nowadays, people look at the hands like
which hands are used as a for bluff but
they miss the most important piece of

[1:06:00]
they miss the most important piece of
information. Does the guy actually fall
enough or is it the clear spot where
people don't have the don't have enough
bluffs which is step one then if we have
identified that then GTO can help us
identify what are the best candidates
but the most important thing is first to
identify well is this actually a good

[1:06:15]
identify well is this actually a good
spot to for bluff and if it is then we
now know which hands would be optimal
right uh so it's kind of you know we
messed up the order um so going to the
next step like I said pre flop uh not
much to to find there uh this is just a
general overview Q broken down flop

[1:06:32]
general overview Q broken down flop
flops turns uh basically just flops and
turns. So we have offense so that's when
we are do the betting and then we have
defense. So basically when we we are
defending in general your offense game
um seems fine. Uh one thing to highlight

[1:06:48]
um seems fine. Uh one thing to highlight
fellow don batter here you could you
could up it a little bit 3.5% GTO is at
4%. Um, we can actually see the success.
You're getting 6% overfolds. Um, and

[1:07:01]
You're getting 6% overfolds. Um, and
you're facing a raise at the same
frequency. So 6% if I do my uh if I do
my note locking math, you can probably
stab 20% more on average if we just note
lock this in our head. So hey,
&gt;&gt; y

[1:07:15]
&gt;&gt; you know, definitely keep on dunking. On
the turn, by the way, we see the same
thing. I see you dunk 5% should be 10%.
So you're missing some dunks here.
you're getting 11% overfolds and 14%
under raises so far. And in general also
if you look at my if I look at every

[1:07:31]
if you look at my if I look at every
database that I've seen, if I look at my
own database, even at higher stakes or
if you just look at data, just something
that's again good to overdo. Uh so I
cannot I cannot do a a live without
telling people to dunk web more, right?
That would be unethical. Um

[1:07:46]
That would be unethical. Um
&gt;&gt; of course,
&gt;&gt; so I'm I'm happy to see at least that
that that you're somewhat in the camp.
uh makes me makes me proud. Um bet
folding flops was another piece of
attention. So if I look at fold versus
race, we can see here 42 instead of 36.

[1:08:03]
race, we can see here 42 instead of 36.
Um now we can look at okay, well where
does it come from? After which sizing,
after which hand class? Um if we look at
the hand class, we can see weak draws 49
instead of 34. So batfolding gutshots,

[1:08:17]
instead of 34. So batfolding gutshots,
for example, seems to be a problem.
you're even bat folding good draws 8.2
versus two. So that's definitely a
problem. Um and you're folding some
middle pairs. So if I look at fold to
raise and let's look at for example a
gutsh shot.

[1:08:31]
gutsh shot.
Um you usually don't really want to fold
gut shots
depending on if the SPR is low. But for
example, this is a blind versus blind
spot. We see bat fill and raises. This
is a in general you don't want to fold a
gutshot with an SPR like this. It's very

[1:08:46]
gutshot with an SPR like this. It's very
very rare. Uh so that's definitely some
point to pay attention to. Uh or we
should maybe not bet the gutshot in the
first place if we expect a lot of
raises. So what's this?

[1:09:00]
raises. So what's this?
This is for example uh I find this
actually a good example that I would
much rather stab here with five six no
diamonds. Kind of my philosophy here is
the hands that you're bet puking that's
the hands you want to check back. So
this hand for example, you step the

[1:09:15]
this hand for example, you step the
thing half pot and he check raises. You
kind of puked. You folded but probably
not with you know I mean you to be fair
I don't think this is actually a fold.
He does go a bit bigger but probably is
not a fold. Um so again it would be uh
but to kind of help with this let's say

[1:09:31]
but to kind of help with this let's say
for example if I expect to get check
raised often that's the first question
right and this board I think that's
definitely the case. Low board he
probably does quite a lot of checking
and a check race is a big part of the
strategy. I would much rather just bet
fold 64 offuit, no diamond. So that's

[1:09:46]
fold 64 offuit, no diamond. So that's
the hand that I would bet and then I
would check back 64 with a diamond. If I
have 54 with a diamond, I would
obviously bet that always because I can
always call a check race. It doesn't
matter which size he goes. So maybe
something to uh to take in
consideration. Uh but yeah, I don't

[1:10:00]
consideration. Uh but yeah, I don't
think this hand is actually a fold, but
that that is a philosophy that uh that
you could use. Um
so let me see. Yeah. So, you're either
bet betting a draw like I said here on
the 56 that you shouldn't you should

[1:10:15]
the 56 that you shouldn't you should
maybe be shouldn't be betting or you
should just call to the check race. So,
the draws is definitely a problem. I
even saw you folded good draw. So, I
don't know what good draw would be draw
but I don't think we get to fold a good
draw

[1:10:33]
especially not at this SPR.
This is a recreational. So maybe we get
a ridiculously big sizing. No, but this
definitely also a call. So you're
folding
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; you're folding you're folding draws

[1:10:45]
&gt;&gt; you're folding you're folding draws
where you simply shouldn't. So maybe you
you don't see good things happening. Um
where there's actually, you know, a lot
of good things that can happen. Like
this one is quite big and this could
actually be a case of
Yeah. said this one maybe I this one is

[1:11:02]
Yeah. said this one maybe I this one is
close because I do expect quite a lot of
folds and you kind of block the main
trap. Uh but I do feel like I would much
rather stab like king jack here and I
would check back my ace9 you know I
would bet a6 again would be the

[1:11:16]
would bet a6 again would be the
difference right if I have a6 I don't
mind getting check race because I always
call this hand specifically
&gt;&gt; I would much rather stab nothing than
this gutshot because getting check race
is just not nice.
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense? Like,
&gt;&gt; yeah, it makes a lot of sense. Or I

[1:11:30]
&gt;&gt; yeah, it makes a lot of sense. Or I
could stab fold with I mean, queen nine
is two overs, but yeah, something like
that where I'm a little bit less about
it.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Um, and I think we also saw
like some middle pairs.
Um,
so this one would be a great example.

[1:11:51]
You see, one third you face a check
race. I mean, he could check race. This
is a spot where for example in theory
you should be check raising 54 76. So

[1:12:00]
you should be check raising 54 76. So
there's plenty of even worse and pocket
eights probably maybe check race at a
very low frequency. Um, and I think
maybe you're underestimating, but
turning a nine, I know it's very
unfrequent, but turning a nine could win
you a stack, right? So, if you just
think about implied odds, odds, you you

[1:12:15]
think about implied odds, odds, you you
probably already there. So, uh, that
would be
&gt;&gt; I think
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; this was probably one of those where I
my huristic was something like I would
call if I had a pair on the board, but
if I have a pocket pair, I don't really
like it as much, which is I mean, it's

[1:12:30]
like it as much, which is I mean, it's
true, but just in this situation where
I've essentially range bet and then face
a not huge check raise, you just have to
be have to be calling second pair or
hands better than second pair.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, for example, especially here,

[1:12:45]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, for example, especially here,
if you think about, for example, if you
have sixes, well, then you're dead
against sevens, right? Uh, nines at
least can still draw out against seven.
So, even if you see your hand as a draw,
uh, which in general, I think is a good
way to look at poker, uh, just think
about every hand in terms of drawing to

[1:13:01]
about every hand in terms of drawing to
towards equity and the EV of that. Well,
drawing towards the turn set or ri set
is pretty good money if he has a bottom
set. So if we just add only that factor
already in this actually we can actually
make quite some money. We will just
maximally lose what is this five and a

[1:13:16]
maximally lose what is this five and a
half big blinds more and we could
potentially win a stack. Um if you look
at poker optimistically like like I do
learning to look at poker optimistically
uh is actually something that and I
actually I pointed out this 89 as well

[1:13:30]
actually I pointed out this 89 as well
just again like he could raise 78 uh so
he could even raise worse. So this is um
yeah definitely a point to pay attention
to. So like these flop pet faults um is
something that I noticed other than
that. So but I also wanted to see like
just if you just have fault versus race

[1:13:46]
just if you just have fault versus race
you still don't really know right.
Right. So this are where I think I hope
I can see now the value that you
straight away can see okay which hand
class is causing the problem. Right. So
that's kind of where uh where I think
the values of an extensive breakdown
like this. Um flop defense

[1:14:04]
I
that's something to note here as well.
Um that in position I saw an overfold 35
verse 27 again. Then we can look at uh

[1:14:18]
verse 27 again. Then we can look at uh
for example the hand class mainly going
to be like basically air and then if I
can tie it to a spot that's you know to
go back to your big blind win rate right
uh single spot imposition prefab caller

[1:14:31]
uh single spot imposition prefab caller
go to lines
we can see that versus a 13 bed you're
folding 34 where it should be folding 21
so that's 13% overfold so quite
significant uh and again here we can see
that the air part

[1:14:45]
that the air part
um So you're folding hands that are air.
So if we look at air, I mean you're
folding low pockets. Usually you don't
really fold a one pair hand unless it's
a bigger bet. So let me see. This is
actually an unintuitive float, but I
would I don't blame you for not floating

[1:15:00]
would I don't blame you for not floating
this one. But this is actually
unintuitive float. It's a great hand to
to start bluffing with later. Um but
this is not something that I would blame
you for not finding. And where is a
better example? This one. Ah, he's

[1:15:15]
better example? This one. Ah, he's
betting half pot. But first one third,
for example, you would not fold fold
this hand for half pot. I would I would
definitely fold it. But in general, like
high cards, ace highs,
uh definitely hands that you do not want
to be folding like this one. Definitely

[1:15:32]
to be folding like this one. Definitely
not a fold. Back door straight draw,
back door flush draw, overcard. This is
a fine race candidate as well, I would
say. Like the three is a great
unblocker. You I have good equity.
Sometimes get called by worse. Think
about hands like 10, eight, jack eight,

[1:15:46]
about hands like 10, eight, jack eight,
check 10, king jack, king 10. Um, so
this is, for example, if I show you
these hands, is there for example, do
you now know looking at this that this
is not a fold?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. This this one seems Yeah.

[1:16:02]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. This this one seems Yeah.
Especially given it's uh Yeah. With so
many back doors and and the ace high
overcard is is just such a a nice one to
continue with. Yeah, it makes a lot of
sense. And
&gt;&gt; my being aware of just when people are

[1:16:16]
&gt;&gt; my being aware of just when people are
when it's wide ranges and when it's
small sizes that you know this is when
we get to we get to battle. I'm I'm
battling in the wrong places and I'm not
battling enough here.
&gt;&gt; That's what I said about the the
emotional bluff catching. So it's like
you get triggered by strength instead of

[1:16:31]
you get triggered by strength instead of
triggered by weakness. Um so this is
more of a and this is kind of the next
process right in terms of how do we
diagnose? Well, we've identified that
we're, for example, overflowing to the
sea bets. Let's go through these hand
classes and let's see, oh, I didn't know

[1:16:46]
classes and let's see, oh, I didn't know
I should be defending this hand. Great.
This is could be just a knowledge
problem. You you set up a drill in the
solver, you know, or you look at it
like, okay, now I know. And if tomorrow
you go play, you might be able to
execute it. No problem. But if you kind
of if you're like, no, actually, I know

[1:17:00]
of if you're like, no, actually, I know
this should be defense, then apparently
it's not a knowledge problem, right?
Usually like a flop defense spot like
this is not necessarily mental games
problem. It's usually then more of a
focus or engagement issue. You're just
not caring enough,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; So, how do we fix that? Well, that as

[1:17:16]
&gt;&gt; So, how do we fix that? Well, that as
well. You know, I have answers to I have
answers to all these problems. So, but
we first need to make the correct
diagnose. And people usually only think
about mistakes in terms of technical
like, oh yeah, the solver said so and
they only try to solve poker with that
part of their brain. It doesn't work

[1:17:31]
part of their brain. It doesn't work
like that. Uh so, the correct diagnose
is very important. So, this would be
another one. Ace5. I would say this
either raise or call. uh we press fold.
Um so this is definitely uh something to
pay attention to. Usually quite an e

[1:17:45]
pay attention to. Usually quite an e
like I said an easy thing to fix if it's
probably like a bit a bit half of them
will maybe be knowledge right because
it's quite a big overfold. So it cannot
be only focus or engagement. Uh so I
would say half is probably just
knowledge. So like maybe the the deuces

[1:18:00]
knowledge. So like maybe the the deuces
float that I that I showed you earlier
on a 109 maybe that's one where like oh
should I call that? I didn't know that.
Um, so that could be knowledge for
example. Sorry,
&gt;&gt; I I was just going to say it seems like
blind versus blind particularly. This is
one that I could I could use some
drilling on is Yeah. You know,

[1:18:16]
drilling on is Yeah. You know,
&gt;&gt; so the the blind versus blind float.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; This would be another great one. And
like you like the nice thing about this
because you need bluffs on an ace or a
10 or a nine.
&gt;&gt; Um,
&gt;&gt; and the best bluffs are the ones that do

[1:18:30]
&gt;&gt; and the best bluffs are the ones that do
the most unblocking and that's always
your lowest pairs and they also have the
most amount of equity. think about
looking poker through an optimistic
lens. We can turn a set, man. We can
rever a set that just like with the
pocket knights. Um, so that's kind of
where
&gt;&gt; this is this is the thing. If you're

[1:18:45]
&gt;&gt; this is this is the thing. If you're
facing a whatever two big blind bet,
it's like you turn the set whatever four
or five% of the time and then it's like,
okay, so that means I need to I need to
win 20 times the money when I do hit and
it's like, can you win an extra 20 or

[1:19:01]
it's like, can you win an extra 20 or
whatever it works out to 30 big blinds
here? probably if they have ace king ace
ace queen they pro you or you know uh
whatever like king queen king king jack
you you probably get a stack so uh works
out quite quite well you need these

[1:19:16]
out quite quite well you need these
these asymmetric upside situations
&gt;&gt; yeah so that's definitely uh one of the
points to uh to pay attention to uh we
already talked about the missing races
right so both scenarios actually with

[1:19:31]
right so both scenarios actually with
that with that uh a3 for example You
could also raise or you're missing the
calls or the raises. We already talked
about the flop check raise from the big
blind. Definitely also a point to pay
attention to. Um
if I go to turn offense, we already

[1:19:46]
if I go to turn offense, we already
talked about this bats the range
construction, right? We already saw that
the bet strong bet weak where actually
we saw that in terms of success, you're
very incentivized to do a lot of
probing. So again, if we take the big
blind note for example, stabbing from

[1:20:00]
blind note for example, stabbing from
the big blind facing a check pack
definitely something we should be
overdoing. So actually you want to kind
of you want to kind of flip your current
strategy. You want to trap more and bet
more air. So you want to flip it around
that would be way more effective. Um

[1:20:17]
that would be way more effective. Um
other than that uh like I said, dunk
more always my model as well. Other than
that, not much to add there. Again, for
the people looking, this is again just a
breakdown sizings that you use. Uh, in
terms of, like I said, in terms of

[1:20:30]
terms of, like I said, in terms of
sizings, you seem to be doing very well.
Sizing scheme, flop, turn. When you're
the offense game, like I said, from the
offense game, I think just on the turn,
uh, there's this this imbalance, but I
think flop, for example, is fine. It's
mainly when you face aggression, that's
when that's when there's, uh, there's

[1:20:47]
when that's when there's, uh, there's
more work to be done. And that's
specifically from the big blind. Um
yes turn. So again the defense problem.
Let me take this away.
Turn defense problem.

[1:21:03]
Turn defense problem.
So
if we look at folding, you're actually
underfolding when you're out of position
mainly. So this is mainly going to be
when you're in the when you're in the
big plant, right? And you're again
you're overfolding in position. I would

[1:21:15]
you're overfolding in position. I would
much rather see this be the other way
around if that makes sense.
Yeah. Yeah, that makes that makes sense
for sure.
&gt;&gt; But actually looking at like phase back
in terms of your game, this is quite an
interesting stat. So this is how often
when you call the turn, how often you

[1:21:31]
when you call the turn, how often you
face aggression on the river. So this is
direct feedback from the games, the
hands that you played and the pools that
you played, what people are doing
against you. And actually, we can see
that when you're out of position and you
call the turn, you're going to actually
face aggression on the river 3% less

[1:21:47]
face aggression on the river 3% less
than average. Now, this is actually not
specifically versus you. This is
actually a trend that I mainly see
overall. And that's because kind of what
you're doing. A lot of people they play
bat bat check with medium holdings. So,

[1:22:00]
bat bat check with medium holdings. So,
what you usually see in just real games
compared to GTO is that people's turn
aggression is higher and then on the
river their aggression is lower. And
then the opportunity there is then
usually to overfold the turn to some
degree because yes, they're betting more

[1:22:15]
degree because yes, they're betting more
and they're giving up the river, but
they're betting more value hands that
actually should be defending them. So
the correct exploit is usually overfold
versus the turn CBAT and then over bluff
versus the check back or over attack the
check back. Right? If we think about
that philosophy of avoid what is strong,

[1:22:31]
that philosophy of avoid what is strong,
well, what's strong? Their turn betting
range. And if something is too strong,
there's always something that's too
weak, right? That's the whole idea. if
you come off balance. Um so that's
actually uh um yeah that's a point I

[1:22:45]
actually uh um yeah that's a point I
wanted to to add there as well. Um
so actually maybe we can look at like
some some turn calls out of position
maybe also first like some bigger
sizings. Let me see. Range. Maybe a

[1:23:02]
sizings. Let me see. Range. Maybe a
middle pair type of hand.
What would be a good example?
This is a one-/3 bet.

[1:23:23]
This blind versus blind.
Uh, what is a good example

[1:23:30]
Uh, what is a good example
of a hand that's quiet?
Queen eight.
This is usually danger when I see this
board.

[1:23:46]
Yeah, this this this one is definitely I
think on the looser side. It is blind
versus blind though. But usually when
the board is this three high connected,
people have to do a bit more slow
playing. And people again, they like to
leave their checking range unprotected
and bet way too much ace for already on

[1:24:01]
and bet way too much ace for already on
the turn. This is just a general
horistic in poker. Anyone listening any
games that you're playing, people
usually just strengthen their betting
ranges
&gt;&gt; and you're you're kind of victim of that
as well to some degree, right? Or guilty
of that, I guess, would be the would be
the better word. Um, so in this spots

[1:24:16]
the better word. Um, so in this spots
then and and like I said actually in
this case it would be good that people
don't float the pocket deuces because
they would have turned a set. Uh, but
they usually then lack like the the
pocket threes bluffs on the turn, stuff
like that and they kind of miss the ace
do slow play on the turn for example and

[1:24:30]
do slow play on the turn for example and
they just always bet themselves. Um, so
yeah, definitely definitely something to
to watch out for like board textures
that are sensitive
to having that bias exaggerated like
this. And also against spots like

[1:24:45]
this. And also against spots like
probably if we look at like some big
blind versus MP barreling. Let me see.
Sing spot opposition prefab caller.
Big blind versus early call weak.
Oh, it's always going to be low pair.

[1:25:05]
pocket sevens. There's a EP range.
Oh, he checks back. That's first a small
bet. That doesn't count.

[1:25:17]
There we have a gutshot.
We face check back. Why do we keep on
facing checks?
[Music]

[1:25:34]
This one probably.
Oh, we Oh, we don't bet. Don't bet
ourselves. Okay, then we check all the I
would probably just check fold the turn
unless you want to go fancy. Again, this
this is again one of these spots where

[1:25:46]
this is again one of these spots where
people should protect their checking
range, but they don't. They just going
to always bet always bet their value
hands. Uh
um
&gt;&gt; yeah, it's the spot where the ranges are
starting to tighten up. It's a it's a a

[1:26:00]
starting to tighten up. It's a it's a a
turn bet now and it's early position
ranges like these are these are where we
have to to get a bit more honest. But,
you know, if when it's the big blind
just versus a C bet, I need to be that's
when I can be a bit wider, you know,
calling I should be calling more with

[1:26:16]
calling I should be calling more with
the gut shots and the the weaker pairs
and things like that. So this one I
would probably already fold the flop
&gt;&gt; and definitely fold the turn.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And definitely fold the river.
&gt;&gt; So yeah, again versus like earlier

[1:26:31]
&gt;&gt; So yeah, again versus like earlier
positions we just have to be a little
bit careful. So this would for example
be a great hand. Um in the process I
explain how to basically fix this this
problem. This would it all starts with
the awareness right that's we've became
aware and now we have to start gathering

[1:26:46]
aware and now we have to start gathering
evidence start have to replay the event
in our in in our head we have to write
down our thoughts write down our
sensations um yeah this is great piece
of information that we can use to fix
your leak for example um

[1:27:01]
your leak for example um
all right let's move to the river and
then we're after that we kind of are
going to wrap it up uh but obviously not
not an inort important street uh the
river.
&gt;&gt; So we actually see that in general when

[1:27:15]
&gt;&gt; So we actually see that in general when
you see the river your win rate is minus
10 instead of 42. So that's a problem.
And like I said it's mainly going to be
uh from making these hero calls. Like I
think your your bluffing your betting
game yourself is not necessarily where
the problem is. However, uh there is

[1:27:33]
the problem is. However, uh there is
definitely some work. Now your bet
percentage is going to be quite high,
but that's also because your bet
percentage on the turn is going to be
quite low. Um,
and one thing that I noticed in terms of
your your bluffing game, you seem to be

[1:27:45]
your your bluffing game, you seem to be
over bluffing, but it's very like
one-dimensional. You seem to have like
one or two lines or sizings. That's kind
of what you like, we talked about that I
think bit before trick before stream as
well. Kind of called you like a one
trick pony. You know, you have one line
that you like to overdo or one sizing

[1:28:01]
that you like to overdo or one sizing
that you like to overdo. uh which can be
very can work very effectively and can
actually be incentivized when uh when
you're playing for example lower stakes
let's say 110l where the deviations are
just bigger um but it's something it can

[1:28:15]
just bigger um but it's something it can
I would call it maybe a bad habit if
you're trying to move up where you just
have to you need to add more tricks in
your game you have to be a bit more
diverse in where you can show up with
bluffs because also uh the people people
become uh better on average right they

[1:28:31]
become uh better on average right they
will still have leaks but they become
smaller So therefore, nuances start to
add in more. Um, and the pools become
big, smaller, so people pay a bit more
attention to you. So then if they know
your trick, uh, yeah, then you're you're
kind of you're kind of lost. Um,

[1:28:46]
kind of you're kind of lost. Um,
then if actually if I looked at check
strong actually, I saw that you were
value betting quite thin when you're in
position. Um, which means that on the
river, your check strong is 14 should be

[1:29:00]
river, your check strong is 14 should be
21. That means that you're value betting
hands that are just check back. So
you're reopening the action. Usually
this is not good if people punish you,
but we can actually see that you face a
raise on the river in position 6% where
it should be 9%. So the way you punish
people who value bet to thin is to not

[1:29:15]
people who value bet to thin is to not
bluff catch but turn those hands into a
bluff. So it seems you're you're making
a deviation. So just this set alone, you
would say, hey, you have a leak. You
shouldn't do that. But it's not
something that gets exploited. It
actually does not get exploited because
it's 6% instead of nine. if if they will

[1:29:30]
it's 6% instead of nine. if if they will
get exploited is 12% instead of nine.
But something to become aware of, maybe
you're value betting hands that you just
think are normal value bets. So maybe
you're making exploit without knowing
it, right? That's obviously a problem.
We we deviations are great as long as
they're they come from uh consciousness.

[1:29:46]
they're they come from uh consciousness.
So it can be just that you just have a
bad habit of making thin value bets
where you shouldn't. And like the river
check out of position is something that
we discussed, right? moving the top of
range to checking lines on the river
when you're out of position and go for a

[1:30:00]
when you're out of position and go for a
check race instead instead of betting
yourself is a way that you can uh uh
make make extra money. Um
let me see
uh what else did I wanted to look at?

[1:30:15]
uh what else did I wanted to look at?
Um
so basically for the for the people
watching this is just uh your river game
broken down into uh all the lines that
you can take uh how successful certain
lines are. So for example we can
actually see that your bet your
continuous so bad bet line uh that's

[1:30:32]
continuous so bad bet line uh that's
actually under bluffed and actually it
gets underfolded as well by population.
So you're getting 52% success where it
should be 54. So people are overalling
and that's again people who have already
overfold flop and turn. So therefore
they just arrive with a stronger range

[1:30:45]
they just arrive with a stronger range
on the river. So actually you're under
bluffing but that's actually
incentivized. Um and you're overbluffing
for example a bic line and that's
actually overfolded by 14%. So from that
perspective you're doing something very
well. Um but like I said it's more of a

[1:31:00]
well. Um but like I said it's more of a
trick. You just keep keep on bet
bluffing and for example you miss bluffs
in call check bet. That would for
example be a line that I think you
should definitely bluff more. uh check
check bat uh stuff like that. So, seems
like your bluffing game is very

[1:31:15]
like your bluffing game is very
one-dimensional, like a big sizing or a
bat, check bat, and that's basically it.
Um there's definitely more spots where
you can find good turn barrels and even
triple barrels, but like I said, you do
want to add a bit more nuance, but for
example, out of position, your your
triple barrels are also getting good

[1:31:30]
triple barrels are also getting good
success. In general, bluffing when
you're out of position, you can see that
as well. You have 54% success where it
should be 42. And that's because out of
position you usually use more smaller
sizings, right? So it's easier also for
the in position to so therefore the

[1:31:46]
the in position to so therefore the
imposition has to defend more basically.
Um which actually brings me to to the
defense because that's I think where
again most of your money can be made. We
can see that here you're folding
basically 45 everywhere. You just have
like a fixed percentage it seems like

[1:32:01]
like a fixed percentage it seems like
and you don't pay attention to if it's
out of position or in position whereas
in position like I said you should fold
42. out position uses fold 57. Now I
would say especially on lower stakes
probably your fault percentage
imposition should be a bit higher
because people use a bit less blocks

[1:32:15]
because people use a bit less blocks
they play usually a bit more polarized.
Uh so obviously this is versus bots. So
this is again something that I explain
as well in the program at various spots
certain benchmarks we have to take in
consideration that they're playing GTO.
So this would for example be a note
where on average GTO just plays a lot

[1:32:30]
where on average GTO just plays a lot
more smaller sizings and therefore we
should fold less and actually out of
position we should actually fold less
because uh in position usually uses
smaller sizings as well. So there's
plenty of spots where population would
throw out a 60 80 probably something

[1:32:46]
throw out a 60 80 probably something
similar as you do where solver would
just go jam or check for example. So uh
it's normal that the gap should be a
little bit less but obviously not it
should not be the same right as we
concluded here. Um uh and then actually

[1:33:01]
concluded here. Um uh and then actually
we can see that your call win for
example in position with hero calls it's
actually going very well uh and in
general we saw that in position so
that's for example big versus small
blind it's fine to make hero calls right
it's the out of position where there's

[1:33:15]
it's the out of position where there's
the problem so the big blind uh and
you're actually calling air way more
often there 56 instead of 30 38 um so
yeah that's uh that's definitely a huge
issue we already saw the the bet sizing
right where we kind of saw the action

[1:33:30]
right where we kind of saw the action
profit based on based on bet sizing. So
that's definitely something to pay
attention to. But if we look at for
example lines, you are
in position for example, you're
overfolding versus a bet.
&gt;&gt; Uh but you're underfolding versus a bet

[1:33:46]
&gt;&gt; Uh but you're underfolding versus a bet
bat. So like again the the line that's
weaker, you're overfolding the line
that's stronger, you're underfolding.
So, it's just like your your your mind
get draws get gets drawn towards where
where the action is, right? So, this is

[1:34:01]
where the action is, right? So, this is
something that you're going to have to
address uh long term if you want to uh
yeah, if you want to succeed in this
game because this is costing you a lot
of money. Um
&gt;&gt; yeah, for sure.
&gt;&gt; Um let me see. We talked about that. And

[1:34:15]
&gt;&gt; Um let me see. We talked about that. And
then like I said, mainly a scholar out
of position.
Um,
yeah, that's kind of it for uh for your
uh overview. Any any thoughts before we
go to the final verdict?

[1:34:30]
go to the final verdict?
I mean, there obviously there's there's
a ton of great stuff here and yeah, I
really appreciate this. is it's I did
have that feeling as I was going through
my year that there's
something in my game that's that's not

[1:34:46]
something in my game that's that's not
obviously showing up in terms of like
the pre flop stats or the seb sizings
that's really hurting my win rate
because you know I see a lot of I I
study with other players I have groups
and and
oftentimes I don't feel myself

[1:35:00]
oftentimes I don't feel myself
completely dwarfed by my friend's
theoretical knowledge of the game right?
Like I feel like we're on a a level par,
but then they might have much higher win
rates. So I felt like there was
something big that I was missing. And
yeah, it does seem to be in these I'm

[1:35:15]
yeah, it does seem to be in these I'm
I'm just getting way too stationary in
these like big pods against early
positions in these like direct
aggression lines. And yeah, as you say,
it's not going to be an easy fix, but
I'm really glad that I've got that
awareness now that, you know, if if I'm
able to to get my head around this, this

[1:35:30]
able to to get my head around this, this
is going to be, you know, this this is
this is thousands of dollars a year,
right? You know, this is this is going
to be
&gt;&gt; this this is going to be huge for you.
So I'm going to I'm going to pull it up
for the for the people uh where I wrote
down kind of the final the final verdict

[1:35:47]
down kind of the final the final verdict
um in like also terms of kind of kind of
hierarchy uh like we already talked
about river bluff catch game mainly from
the big blind defense you already
pointed out I wrote down two emotional
bluff catching fighting versus strength
of instead of weakness uh overfolding in

[1:36:02]
of instead of weakness uh overfolding in
position versus small sizings and disc
discontinued aggression and then
underfolding out of position versus
bigger sizings and continuous
aggression. So, we all want to flip that
around. Um, so that's like I said in
terms of making money. Uh, that's that's

[1:36:16]
terms of making money. Uh, that's that's
probably the most important thing. Then
the next one is your playing value,
right? Is there's more to maximizing
your value than just betting big and
hoping you know someone calls. Uh, so I
said playing mid-range too aggressively,

[1:36:30]
said playing mid-range too aggressively,
betting for value while getting folds
instead of bluff catching. So that would
be that pocket tense example that we
looked at. So that's an area where uh
you're going to up your your blue line
winnings. Um not maximizing top of
range, just betting yourself. So for

[1:36:45]
range, just betting yourself. So for
example, small versus big blind going
for a sebat check race line instead.
That would be a great way to build pots
going for that delay versus check race
or when you're on the river uh bat turn
check race river or check call or turn
goes check check and you check race

[1:37:00]
goes check check and you check race
river from the big blind stuff like
that. Uh not enough slow playing in
general on flop turn river. That was
kind of my verdict. So these two points
uh like I said in your game we can see
that you have theoretical knowledge of
the game. You have a lot of experience
in the game. You also said with your

[1:37:15]
in the game. You also said with your
friends you don't see a lot of
difference. These two things I think are
going to be huge for you in terms of if
I can if I can say what's going to
contribute to most of your win rate.
It's this um upturn aggression with
bluffs. And this was in general like
that range construction difference,

[1:37:31]
that range construction difference,
right? We wanted to move more of these
two street value hands to turn checks
and then bluff catch river to up your
blue line and your red line actually has
to go up by adding way more bluffs in
this spot. Right? We don't necessarily
have to go for the bat bat, right? But
there's plenty of spots where a turnbat

[1:37:46]
there's plenty of spots where a turnbat
is going to be already very profitable.
Um, for example, stabbing, delaying,
barreling, and then I wrote down become
less of a one-trick pony. Uh, just
moving all hands to batic bat and just
only using the river overbat, for
example, as a bluff. um or at least

[1:38:02]
example, as a bluff. um or at least
overbluffing just that specific one
trick. So, a bit more diversity there.
Actually, we didn't really touch on
this. Uh but the tree pots I wrote down
various variants was definitely present
as we saw in the variance tab in the
beginning. Uh but you are you definitely

[1:38:17]
beginning. Uh but you are you definitely
have a tendency of doing this under
aggressing and overfolding quite a lot.
Uh oh, this was actually one thing that
I didn't point out. Let me quickly point
that one out. uh but not huge in terms
of uh something that you have to pay

[1:38:31]
of uh something that you have to pay
attention to. I will teach you guys how
to prioritize correctly as well in the
program. Right? This is step two. Step
one is analyze. This is this step. Step
two is how do we prioritize? And I
didn't write down all the leaks, right?
Uh there's there's more, right? And this

[1:38:45]
Uh there's there's more, right? And this
is completely normal. So don't go here
in the chat. Dan sucks at poker. Uh in
the program itself, I go over my my um
all my game. And then in the end the
concl my conclusion is WKO sucks at
poker. Uh just like everyone else,
everyone sucks at poker. The job is suck
less. Maybe sounds a bit wrong but uh

[1:39:02]
less. Maybe sounds a bit wrong but uh
you understand what I mean. Um so yeah,
poker a game of mistakes. Make less
mistake of your opponents and you will
win. Uh you actually overcheck calling
uh flop versus cbat. This is actually
something that uh it's very common for a

[1:39:15]
something that uh it's very common for a
population to do. But in these spots uh
let me see check off flop. Let me look
at like some probably it's going to be
like your low pocket pairs
and then like a king high board or
something. Something like this. This

[1:39:30]
something. Something like this. This
blind first blind man.
This for example. Oh, this one's
actually quite a big one as well.
Yeah, this is this is a like this is
already a fold on like a king deuce
three board for example. So when the
board is king three deuce pocket seven

[1:39:46]
board is king three deuce pocket seven
is already straight away folding. So
imagine if there's two broadways. These
are just like spots where you have to
just white white flag it like he he just
has such a huge range advantage. High
boards are just a matter of you get to
massively overfold and he just gets to

[1:40:00]
massively overfold and he just gets to
range bet and from there we we play we
we continue on playing. If you if you're
trying to [ __ ] with those ranges, uh not
where the money is. Again, kind of
identifying where the ranges are strong,
right? Like if you think about the
street range, especially people who go
linear, don't have a flatting range.

[1:40:16]
linear, don't have a flatting range.
They have all the broadways. Uh like
this is kind of best case scenario.
You're up against ace queen or like an
ace five or something, right? Uh,
&gt;&gt; and this still has I don't I don't even
know
&gt;&gt; and it has the the range advantage

[1:40:31]
&gt;&gt; and it has the the range advantage
equity wise. So, it can definitely it's
going to put a lot of pressure you on
boards that are favorable for him. So,
you you're just not getting these hands
to showdown enough. So, this is actually
uh uh quite a big league as well.
However, the spot three pots out
position of color is not very very

[1:40:46]
position of color is not very very
frequent. So, I wouldn't necessarily pay
a lot of attention or put a lot of
conscious effort into that. Uh where is
the where is the sheet?
Uh then database review right here. Um

[1:41:02]
Uh then database review right here. Um
fast playing too much bluffing too
little with raises kind of right that we
already concluded that that that was
here as well. And the fast playing right
the fast playing I showed you that
pocket fives or pocket sevens on this
what was it? Queen 95 in position three

[1:41:15]
what was it? Queen 95 in position three
by pot.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. uh smaller pots spots that I that
I pointed out reduce for bed bluffing
versus big blind. The overfolding versus
small seabbat this is actually the
overfall was quite significant and the
spot is decently frequent. Um

[1:41:33]
spot is decently frequent. Um
yeah and this is a very easy fix. So in
terms of also how to prioritize we have
to take in consideration how hard is it
to fix something. So like reduce for
bluffing versus big blind doesn't really
seem that hard to fix in my opinion

[1:41:45]
seem that hard to fix in my opinion
right. So, it's something that we can
easily tweak. This one is a little bit
harder. So, the spot is, you know, it's
a single race spot. It is a flop spot,
so a bit more frequent. Not really sure
where I would rate this one. Probably
somewhere in the middle in terms of how
important it is. Finding more bluffs

[1:42:01]
important it is. Finding more bluffs
raises for a small C bet. It kind of
goes hand in hand. So, your game versus
the small C bet. Um, flop fold versus
race. Ah, we talked about that, right?
That with this gutshot, I think we
looked at the 56. That's a good example.
And in terms of variance also something

[1:42:15]
And in terms of variance also something
that I take take to look at it is uh
yeah you're running not that great. So
if you if the heat picks up picks up a
little bit and you fix at least these
two issues and then maybe you know some
some small things like the for bluffing

[1:42:32]
some small things like the for bluffing
and the and the floating versus cbat man
3B 4B 100 definitely uh uh very very
realistic and to get give people an idea
at least over the sample it was now
right now it was zero uh yeah we can

[1:42:47]
right now it was zero uh yeah we can
definitely get it to at least something
like that um probably even higher
because this this this these two they
they cost you quite a lot of money. Um
so hard hard to give exact number but uh
I'm I'm optim I'm optimistic. So uh

[1:43:02]
I'm I'm optim I'm optimistic. So uh
&gt;&gt; uh and and this is just something that I
wrote on like I said there's definitely
more um and we can uh we can sit here
all night and tomorrow as well and we
can continue right it's just a matter
how deep you want to go. uh in the new

[1:43:15]
how deep you want to go. uh in the new
league buster program I give you the
tools and knowledge how to do it
yourself and this is I think a lot of
people they know the value of database
analysis I went to chat GPT I said what
does a database analysis for online
poker cost it gave me a ballpark
estimate set for a typical online poker

[1:43:30]
estimate set for a typical online poker
player doing a serious database review
something like 50 to 200k hands uh which
is what we did right 50k hands good
coach I'll give I'll give myself some
credit here uh live feedback well I give
you live feedback you're likely looking
at around 250 to $800 as a common range

[1:43:46]
at around 250 to $800 as a common range
depending on how extensive the review
is, how qualified the coach, so kind of
the stakes that he plays and the
experience that he has. So let's say
this was uh worth roughly somewhere in
the middle four 500 bucks. Let's say
that's kind of what you can look at in

[1:44:00]
that's kind of what you can look at in
terms of cost. And with the leak buster,
we I basically give you the tool to do
it and I teach you to do it yourself. So
people often then go to a coach, right?
But the problem is, you know, I'm doing
this now with Dan and then uh let's say
this session would cost Dan normally 500

[1:44:15]
this session would cost Dan normally 500
bucks. Three months from now, Dan will
have to call me again and say, "Hey,
wacker, we have to do another session."
And then a quart the next quarter we
have to do another session, you know,
and then he's already before I know it
at the end of the year, he spent 2k on
database reviews. Way more ideal if I
would just show you, right, and teach

[1:44:32]
would just show you, right, and teach
you how to do it yourself. Um, so that's
kind of what what we did with the
leakbuster program. Uh, if I go to the
site.
So here, if you go to the link, let me

[1:44:47]
So here, if you go to the link, let me
put the link here in the chat.
Uh, all the information that you need is
right here. You go to let's [ __ ] go
because obviously you're interested. So
for 1K, that's basically the cost of two
of these sessions. I teach you exactly

[1:45:00]
of these sessions. I teach you exactly
how to do it yourself. Let me get this
correctly on screen. I teach you exactly
how to do it yourself. I teach you how
to fix these actual leak, right? Because
then is now like okay, I've became aware
of my biggest win rate booster is indeed

[1:45:15]
of my biggest win rate booster is indeed
this this this problem on the river, but
how do I fix it? Uh this is something
that I'll explain you in the program. Uh
I think actually if I go back to the
site, I can give if we go scroll down
there's an overview. it is.

[1:45:31]
there's an overview. it is.
So here we have the whole analyze
section. So I will show you exactly how
I do it through my own database. Uh
actually let me quickly log in. That's
maybe easier so I can give you guys a
better overview of how this looks.

[1:45:49]
sign in.
All right. Right. So if I log in

[1:46:13]
or here and I go to the league buster.

[1:46:18]
Uh I explain you like I said step by
step. It's something that I like to call
the feedback loop. Uh so we can find the
feedback loop here. and analyze is only
the first part of and that's kind of

[1:46:31]
the first part of and that's kind of
what we did right so now we have to
prioritize because we saw that we have a
lot of leaks then we have to diagnose
and redesign we have to come up with the
real reason why that problem exists and
we have to come up with a fix then we
have to start training and internalizing

[1:46:45]
have to start training and internalizing
the new way to do things and game time
this is all about what we do pre session
what we do to increase our performance
during the session like Dan already
pointed out yeah I know I shouldn't be
doing this but then in session
everything goes wrong. Right? So that's
kind of what I discuss in game time. How
do we set ourselves up uh so we can

[1:47:02]
do we set ourselves up uh so we can
actually do the improved thing? Evaluate
monitor. I think I already touched on
this a little bit. Obviously the main
difference here between some monitoring
something and a complete analysis is
kind of the sample size, right? So are
we actually doing what we set out to do?

[1:47:16]
we actually doing what we set out to do?
So I teach you exactly how to do this
yourself and then we repeat. and repeat
this uh because in the end uh the loop
never ends because mastery never ends
right there is no stagnation in poker
you either go forward you grow or you go

[1:47:31]
you either go forward you grow or you go
in decline because the rest is always
improving right so if you're not proving
it's not like oh like no I'm not going
to do anything on my game and you just
stay there no it doesn't work like that
um so yeah this basically the next step
would be uh prioritize for Dan I already

[1:47:46]
would be uh prioritize for Dan I already
gave him a little bit of help this these
first two points I know is where the
real money's is going to be and then
then has to go through this section the
diagnose and redesign and especially for
the the river the river section I think
from what I can tell this is clearly a

[1:48:01]
from what I can tell this is clearly a
mental game issue so that's kind of uh
what I will cover actually in in this
video
uh we will talk about the fear and we
will talk about biases we will talk
about but we keep it very practical and
around the the goal here is to fix the

[1:48:16]
around the the goal here is to fix the
leak right there's plenty of mental game
content out there and it's like Yeah,
it's all very cool, but it doesn't it
doesn't apply. And this one is strictly
straight away applies to your leaks and
I teach you exactly what to do and how
to fix it. So, it's not just rambling
around, oh, you have a fear of failure

[1:48:31]
around, oh, you have a fear of failure
and therefore no, we we we turn it into
action points. All right? And then uh
then it's going to uh uh find a fishious
way to train it, internalize it, game
them. Like I said, what you do preession
uh and we will kind of link everything.

[1:48:46]
uh and we will kind of link everything.
Again, presession is not just and this
is how ma mainly people see it. I think
I wrote it literally here. It's not a
checklist or to-do list.
Pre-prep isn't about listing everything

[1:49:00]
Pre-prep isn't about listing everything
you should or shouldn't do. So, no, and
this is what Dan said with the post-it
notes. Stop doing this, stop doing that.
Right? That's usually how we like to
approach presession, but it's about
creating and entering the zone where
those things happen naturally. So, this
is a very big mindset shift. So again, I

[1:49:15]
is a very big mindset shift. So again, I
kind of want to show this because I feel
like there's kind of people have
experience with oh yeah presession,
mental game, performance coaching, but
this is very practical and we every time
link it back to the leaks for example in
this case that I found when I walked
through my game. So basically everything

[1:49:30]
through my game. So basically everything
that you now saw with then that's
something that I did with my own game.
Okay. So I I definitely also if you want
to exploit me I'll also share all my
leaks in this video and at some point I
think at the conclusion I believe it was
as you can see just as what I did with

[1:49:45]
as you can see just as what I did with
Dan I also did for myself wrote down a
lot of leaks and I think it was
somewhere in the end that I came to the
conclusion
that

[1:50:00]
that
this was a conclusion the wacko sucks at
poker. That's uh that was my conclusion
just like that we came to the conclusion
that dad sucks at poker and anyone who
would come up to this YouTube channel uh
we all suck at poker guys but luckily we
don't have to be perfect right poker is

[1:50:16]
don't have to be perfect right poker is
a game of mistake make less mistakes
than your opponent and you will win uh
also in terms of like a little deboss in
terms of beliefs what it takes to become
a good professional poker player right
people think that you need some sort of
talent or or some luck or I don't know

[1:50:32]
talent or or some luck or I don't know
money whatever
But you need a systematic approach to
getting better. That's literally what
sets what sets people apart. And
basically this program, I did my best to
create a step-by-step approach. You just
follow this approach. I give you all the

[1:50:46]
follow this approach. I give you all the
tools, all the knowledge that you need
in order to improve as a poker, improve
as a poker player, uh, and find and fix
leaks in your game for good, right? How
to work on your game. Um, so yeah,
that's kind of it for me. Uh Dan,

[1:51:02]
that's kind of it for me. Uh Dan,
anything you would like to uh any final
words from your side?
&gt;&gt; No, nothing major. I just want to yeah
express my my thanks to you and to the
team. This is obviously a a really
useful tool and useful framework for

[1:51:16]
useful tool and useful framework for
thinking about how to get better at
poker. The key for me is that, you know,
nothing in poker is particularly
in terms of improving at poker, none of
it is particularly hard in terms of like

[1:51:30]
it is particularly hard in terms of like
brain surgery is hard or
&gt;&gt; guitar is hard or something like that.
But it's it's hard it's or it's not hard
to do, but it's hard over the long term.
It's hard to stick with it. Stay
consistent. Do the things that really
make a difference in your game. And when

[1:51:46]
make a difference in your game. And when
you have a process that you can just
like every day wake up, I'm I'm
following it. These are my three leaks.
These are how I work on them. These are
my this is my warm-up routine. If you
have all those things in place, it makes
uh improving a poker become a lot more a
lot easier, a lot more automatic because

[1:52:01]
lot easier, a lot more automatic because
the process is already there. You don't
have to think about how am I structuring
my study plan every single day. So yeah,
&gt;&gt; and it makes poker a lot more fun.
Actually, this is actually something
that I share um in in I think

[1:52:15]
that I share um in in I think
introduction at some point. I think I
share like how I kind of came to this
and at my story somewhere in the
beginning I actually share one of the
sessions I did with Elliot Row um very
long time ago uh but super effective and
basically it showed me that there's two

[1:52:31]
basically it showed me that there's two
roads to poker. You can kind of grind it
out or you can try to become the best.
and he kind of switched me that normally
you think that trying to become the best
is actually harder but it actually isn't
because that process if you do it if you
do it well kind of what I explain in the

[1:52:46]
do it well kind of what I explain in the
program um that process is actually
something that gives you a lot of energy
uh and it actually makes poker super
enjoy enjoyable uh it's way easier to
become engaged and play well and be

[1:53:00]
become engaged and play well and be
curious and you will you will just enjoy
yourself uh way more. All right. So,
yeah, definitely uh I put a lot of uh a
lot of my passion into this little
product. So, definitely go check it out.
Leakbuster. Uh you can find here the

[1:53:16]
Leakbuster. Uh you can find here the
link somewhere down below in the chat. I
want to thank Dan for uh coming on. It
definitely takes some courage to have
your database reviewed live on YouTube
for thousands of people to watch. Um,

[1:53:30]
for thousands of people to watch. Um,
like I said, guy Dan Dan said in the
beginning he has a master master class a
master plan, right? This is just
advertisement. Now he's going to do
exactly the opposite. So, uh, uh, for
Dan, this was a good investment.
&gt;&gt; This is an advertisement. Everyone come

[1:53:45]
&gt;&gt; This is an advertisement. Everyone come
and bluff me now. You know, you know I'm
going to call, right? Guarantee it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. He says, I'm I'm going to I'm
going to, he's like, okay, there's two
ways that I can fix my problem of
stationing on the river. I can either
fix it, but that's hard and I'm not
really sure how to do it. Or I go on the
WCO stream, show everyone I'm a station

[1:54:02]
WCO stream, show everyone I'm a station
and then tell them I'm not going to do
it anymore and they're going to bluff me
so I can actually just keep on calling.
&gt;&gt; Easy game,
&gt;&gt; man. And and and then you said this is
less complicated than brain surgery. I
don't believe it.

[1:54:17]
&gt;&gt; So trying to become the best is what
we're doing in the mechanics. Yes. The
mechanics of poker is showing you the
mechanics behind poker success and
trying to become the best player that
you can be. For sure.
All right. Well, then I want to I want

[1:54:30]
All right. Well, then I want to I want
to thank you, man, for for sharing it.
Uh I want to thank everyone who showed
up live. Uh if you showed up in the
replay, let me know in the comments down
below how you like it. Give this video a
thumbs up. Share it with people who you
think might have similar issues, right?

[1:54:45]
think might have similar issues, right?
Stationing the river or always or it's
it's either the other camp. It's two
camps. Either you're stationing or
you're always overfalling. That's like
the main the main two two big issues
that people that people have. And I will
show you exactly
