[00:00]
eh i should have bet oh unless you
bought
that i should not have been
it's a good river

[00:17]
it's a good river
and adjusted the a7 he just had the a7

[00:30]
and adjusted the a7 he just had the a7
you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo hello hello hello hello
oh wait i was commenting on the
different table i said it is a little
bit high

[00:45]
bit high
i called here because the 18 bb stack
okay but we flop we flopped brandon said
actually the 78 was a little bit high
for my taste i want seven
six or five six and that is the guter

[01:01]
six or five six and that is the guter
god dammit
jesus that is a good turn
that is what we call an awesome turn
just rip it in man ace king

[01:26]
just rip it in man ace king
hey calls that's what we call a bad
river guys
pretty sure we do have the best hand

[01:30]
pretty sure we do have the best hand
though
i think i'm gonna bet again
where's mr gary

[01:46]
but it's very it's very thin when the
ace actually is not another spade yeah
you fall
that's very likely whenever i do
something that's not gto guys it's
deliberate
or low frequency okay

[02:02]
or low frequency okay
while we flop top top
top up top i get two colors interesting
what do both of you guys have guys

[02:21]
i'm not sure i'm going to make a little
barrel
but do you have tough a i'm pretty sure
we have the best hand

[02:33]
he calls probably also has a king
come on call my friend don't do anything

[02:45]
come on call my friend don't do anything
crazy like raising
[Music]
yes yes yes my friend so you call from
the small blind
check call three-way check call

[03:01]
check call three-way check call
three-way check grace river
interesting did you [ __ ] the king 9 on
the river my friend
but actually that's only one combination
we have eight that excels only one
combination
we have pocket threes

[03:18]
we have pocket threes
the problem is actually pocket five
spokes five is also still likely
okay okay i uh i
uh i make uh clearly this is a
deliberate deviation from the quote

[03:30]
deliberate deviation from the quote
unquote well i occasionally flop a set
god damn it we flopped sets on this
stream
i think with sixes i'm just gonna focus
on coolering him
that's basically this is this is gonna
be some advanced poker guys

[03:46]
be some advanced poker guys
play against official a little bit
deeper you think there is a very good
chance he's a little bit strong
e3 ballet and board is quite scary
overpass make up a very big majority of
his range
10x as well then i think just with
exactly a hand like sixes that can go

[04:00]
exactly a hand like sixes that can go
for value
just try to now get the money in like
basically with sixes your value doesn't
have to come from
uh villain bluffing yes obviously if you
check all
uh he's gonna have

[04:16]
uh he's gonna have
pocket queens i'm willing to play with
i'm willing to play with pocket queens
mr between
a bad small i think i'm doing half pot i

[04:30]
a bad small i think i'm doing half pot i
think it was nine four four i would
definitely bet half pot maybe even
bigger
but i think i'm nine five five i can
just bet small calls
pink turn ow ooh this one's quite close
i think i check

[04:46]
jax i'm definitely betting tens i'm
definitely betting
kings i'm definitely checking queens
without a spade could maybe bet

[05:01]
and on the river i think we have magic
but

[05:19]
he raises okay gg mr easy
okay saying as an ace
my queens are quite unrelevant

[05:37]
you definitely check back raise river
with it

[05:50]
okay gg hey guys we got the 7 to suit it
let's go
[Music]

[06:05]
a little bit okay there's already
significant pot for us guys
yeah we're gonna call the river as
everything misses

[06:17]
everything misses
unless he over bets or something
there's 70 percent we're calling wish us
luck
ah god damn it now we're down now we
have to be aggressive

[06:30]
have to be aggressive
uh hey buddy versus gary i'll start off
with a little bet because gary
gary ain't so aggressive and gary a
little bit tight so you have a lot of
hands to calls with
similar story here on the turn

[06:49]
similar story here on the turn
a similar story on the river i'm a
little bit worried though because the
guy can have a stan ace jack etc etc but
yeah i'm not really check
folding so then i think batting myself
is probably better but hey i wouldn't be

[07:02]
is probably better but hey i wouldn't be
surprised if he just snap calls it up
with ace queen or something
but he probably also asked suited aces
come on gary no i said come on get
really shifty second

[07:15]
really shifty second
guys gary is a set
god damn it gary
and we can flop a set here two and a bb
deep and win a big pot

[07:30]
deep and win a big pot
uh check out the flop
probably check on the turn

[07:47]
and check folding the river
been very uh very quiet with the
funky plays here with the seven deuce

[08:10]
fortunately

[08:21]
owen we cannot hold that one

[08:44]
like a little forward over the ace king

[08:52]
suited
okay

[09:00]
that is an excellent flop as i say

[09:28]
another great turn to be honest

[09:56]
it checks

[10:18]
any volts but we're going to flop a set
here
and wheel this guy in is this going to
be our turnaround guys as we have slowly

[10:30]
be our turnaround guys as we have slowly
be bleeding money
i'm gonna go with a check here with

[10:45]
i'm gonna go with a check here with
nines
checks again
it's a recreational you know i think the
only thing i can do is just bat big and
hope he has
queens or something that he still thinks
is a pretty hand

[11:05]
but i most likely going to fold quite
often with my money back here from mr
captain stupid
so far he's been using normal sizes his

[11:15]
so far he's been using normal sizes his
name does sound a little bit familiar
this crazy finish crazy finish

[11:32]
so far he feels wreck-ish from what i
see with 3-bet sizing see bet sizings
i mean i'm not falling to any size

[11:45]
i mean i'm not falling to any size
unless he jams off but definitely god
bitter

[12:04]
don't really see much point in bedding
depends how often he puts ace king in
so don't mind betting actually with this

[12:16]
so don't mind betting actually with this
hand in hindsight
and i'm probably calling any a screen on
the flop right so i think actually the
one with the spade
i don't think i get check raised all
that often

[12:30]
that often
uh if i just check
i think even though this is a very good
river to follow through on
i bluff
[Music]
these three gets their six seven gets
their force get there

[12:46]
their force get there
i kind of have to bluff but i'm not very
happy about it
but he still has maybe like hands like
ace king with the king of spades that
he's just always folding
and i think in general let's say he has
had like tents yeah he's in a pretty
tough spot

[13:10]
deuces fives from 8x67 h3
i thought about it for quite a while so

[13:16]
i thought about it for quite a while so
if you thought about it for quite a
while with jax
with a spade he's probably folding jacks
without a spade
so i don't mind my bluff i think it's
fine god damn it guys you flop another
set
flopping sets ain't bad i'm gonna start

[13:30]
flopping sets ain't bad i'm gonna start
up with
i'm gonna delete it turn probably
gonna check again yeah i should have bet
oh
unless you bought that i should not have

[13:47]
unless you bought that i should not have
been
now do we race don't think so
yes trees he's gonna go broke on most
rivers anyway
now there's still like sort of a random

[14:00]
factor
it's a good river
and it's just at the ice he just had the

[14:16]
and it's just at the ice he just had the
a7
so you gotta check twice towards this
guy let me note that
and then we're gonna slowly come to the
end guys
if you haven't done so i find it very
hard to believe

[14:30]
hard to believe
follow us on basically any social media
platform in the world
while we three bet the king queen suited
and raise the ace king suited
and we're gonna four by the asking suit

[14:46]
and happily getting it in come on some
luck here
i am lucky i am lucky
oh that's that's guy flops quads
seriously come on split it

[15:02]
seriously come on split it
unbelievable unbelievable
