how are you all today i'm good thanks
actually haven't checked out the lobby
or at least i have but i haven't seen
i have they were they're going crazy

[01:00]
i have they were they're going crazy
guys at the poker tables
there is uh we got a little text here on
we got a little osp
we got a stefan we got a nacho we got a
munich and we got a little david jones
it's probably one of the
toughest lineups that you can find on
the internet i would say or only persons
missing is linus and mikey boyfriend i

[01:15]
missing is linus and mikey boyfriend i
would say
unfortunately guys you know dave was
full yeah what can we do
else we would have obviously taken a
seat
not then we'll also join the waiting
list because there's a very juicy 1020
game going on
and this is usually the reason right why

[01:30]
and this is usually the reason right why
they are now uh playing this game
usually uh unless you're one of the
absolute end bosses and you're just
going to battle it out with each other
that is the other time that people are
just playing a full red game
well we actually have one of our
favorite songs chewing and we have

[01:46]
favorite songs chewing and we have
pocket queens
and we have pocket jacks we betting both
to be continued then we flop quartz
okay okay okay what are you doing flop
quads you check
no i'm not really gonna check this board

[02:01]
no i'm not really gonna check this board
so i'll just start up with a small bet
but yeah you know basic math tells me
that it's very unlikely that he has a
jack
if he does turn out to have a jack we
have to call pokestars because something

[02:15]
have to call pokestars because something
is wrong
but you know let's go for the barrel
here
i'm gonna be barreling this turn i think
at a decently high frequency
but that's just what i'm gonna do

[02:30]
let's fire out that second barrel
and the river i think all we can do is
check see we'll have some miss flush
dots he will have some on the pairs
but on the other side

[02:45]
he also has quite a lot of ace heist
actually gonna jam it's a it's a weird
spot it's a weird spot
i figured he would have quite a lot of
king highs ace highs and given my three
bet range
which is gonna be concentrated a little

[03:00]
which is gonna be concentrated a little
bit more in the middle
like i had like 10 7 suited for example
is a hand that i could have which you
can three but from the big blind and not
from the small blind
if i was in a small blind i think i
would just check the river

[03:15]
would just check the river
uh but i figured now that there it was
decently it was likely that he could
find it more likely i thought that he
could find a hero call with an ace high
then he would find a bluff uh basically
i think an attorney should already do
some folding with his lower pocket pairs

[03:30]
some folding with his lower pocket pairs
especially if they have a flush blocker
uh i think and like ace 10 ace queen are
always playing this way regardless or if
they are flushable or not they have all
the a6 diamonds and all the asexual
clubs
um i like my decision

[03:46]
um i like my decision
uh and i like how i also changed my mind
in the middle of the hand that i did
decide to go for value when the board
parked bye for off
we're playing 10 20. so the rake's a
little bit lower so let's uh
let's see if we can flop something this
is an okay board
and i will probably go for a little

[04:00]
and i will probably go for a little
check race with my uh
five of clubs as the optimistic people
can already see that we're gonna make a
straight flush
so let's go for the little check race
and let's make a straight flush

[04:16]
and let's make a straight flush
i am lucky i am skillful and i will win
you got to feel it no uh no i can't mop
x decides to go for it through it i
think i'm just gonna
no i cannot fault can i fault

[04:32]
no i cannot fault can i fault
i'm gonna bet i'm not gonna bet
i was thinking the lead out but if i
have a six do i really want to lead out

[04:45]
i already have so few good hands and if
i have a good hand it's a
it's a crusher
hey yes pocket tents good for him now
sometimes college

[05:00]
sometimes college
mainly three bad but quite a low number
so let's go for the call
let's try a little donkey donkey donkey
why not you [ __ ] dunk you do it again
i remember in a video before i've told

[05:15]
i remember in a video before i've told
you to not have good news for you guys
why do you do that why we made quite a
strong hand on the turn i'm gonna go for
the over but
he calls interesting river
probably gonna go for a small bat i

[05:31]
probably gonna go for a small bat i
would say let me think
yeah it's very likely unlikely that he
has nothing
any faults nah that's unfortunate yeah i

[05:45]
any faults nah that's unfortunate yeah i
think the 5 4 is definitely uh
i mean you can kind of go both ways
right you can make an argument for
betting small
and just basically it's kind of a
situation where you're betting 20
of the pot almost never has to work um
if he has air is likely to fold it

[06:03]
if he has air is likely to fold it
this way let's say for example we have
rivered an eight with eight extra clubs
we can still value bet that
um or you can go for the very big bet
as we have a six and he probably doesn't

[06:15]
as we have a six and he probably doesn't
have a six
so that would be option b let's say
option b
sounds a little bit better

[06:32]
oh that's what they call pocket trips
pocket trips hey hey
you already there first guys that's what
they call pocket trips
gonna make a small bet here on the turn

[06:48]
gonna make a small bet here on the turn
and just check the river
i think on the river we're only gonna
better straighten a boat
updated to give it to me baby clip give

[07:00]

dollar worth of value go over to the

checking back
king nine of clubs that's gtl
facing an overbear on the turn not very
gto
but we do have a good hand now to call

[07:47]
but we do have a good hand now to call
it
so let's start with that
interesting river as it completes
something but it also completes
us
if he didn't have two pair he's now

[08:00]
if he didn't have two pair he's now
counterfeited
80 i think we have to call
good luck us and he indeed river toad
was a very bad river guys

[08:16]
was a very bad river guys
it was a very bad river
always the [ __ ] flush guys
oh my god [ __ ] god damn [ __ ]
sucker
you know i tried to i tried to put a

[08:30]
you know i tried to i tried to put a
move i tried trying to
induce him to get frisky but they just
didn't do it
and then the goddamn card comes they
always come every goddamn
time the [ __ ] goddamn flesh card
comes every goddamn time
if you were playing for a living with no

[08:46]
if you were playing for a living with no
stream would you still play
these all wrecked lineups yes
as long as they're four-handed or
three-handed
or five-handed but not six-handed the
only reason this game is running

[09:02]
or at least that's not completely true
so the only reason i'm playing in this
game
is because
this table okay

[09:15]
is running and if you want to be on the
waiting list nowadays you have to be
also playing um
and they're randomly gonna pick someone
from the waiting list
and who is playing is vadim lx570
anyone who plays on poker stars a decent

[09:32]
anyone who plays on poker stars a decent
amount
will know him oh frequency three bet
here
so oh not a hundred five that's a little
bit too much huh
well high number so let's go for it i
know this guy and he's

[09:45]
know this guy and he's
as they say not the greatest of players
so
i decided to go play
and hope to get moved to the table so
it's a little bit more of a live
environment you could say
or something skull but high number so

[10:01]
or something skull but high number so
i'll mix in a little three bet here with
the [ __ ] fives oh actually i went a
little bit bigger and i see twelve and a
half
it's a little bit costly now isn't it
mine now what you're gonna do
now we're gonna fire big my friend

[10:18]
now we're gonna fire big my friend
that's a bad turn as i say as it will
have completed
some stuff also we don't have a spade
which actually in three by parts i've
found makes the taxi more likely for you

[10:31]
found makes the taxi more likely for you
to barrel so actually
maybe i'll go for a little barrel will
we go for a little barrel
yes little bit funky
oh that's a bad river

[11:00]
still gonna go for it he snap calls me
with tents
well that's not good that's not good
guys that's not good
that's not good guys that was uh that
was maybe a little bit scary
guys we need some help playing this

[11:15]
guys we need some help playing this
pocket person
how do we play pocket pass the last tip
i have for you
is on small pocket pairs and these are
hands that you can win
monster pots so when you get delta
pocket pair

[11:30]
pocket pair
try to flop a set play it smooth and win
all the money
okay i'll try that next time thanks man
good advice
while we open up the king six on the big
boy stakes
the floppy flush

[11:47]
which the last time i checked is
considered a reasonably strong hand so
that's our betting
and we got a subscriber thank you very
much sir
okay now we actually have to dutch on
rivers mainly a four

[12:01]
rivers mainly a four
a seven and nine
it draws a little donkey donkey
king high flush stroke is a stephanie
raising boats they've never set
definitely raising

[12:16]
definitely raising
it's close i'm gonna call can't
reevaluate the situation that's what i'm
gonna do
checks it means we're batting

[12:32]
sucked because i would like you to play
that video on how to play pocket bears
again
i said all right next time we get a
pocket pair
oh oh spew what you gonna do oh you call

[12:45]
oh oh spew what you gonna do oh you call
that's good that was people
calling us a loud my friend oh my god we
had flush over flush and he didn't get
stacked how does the board bear
what the father god
damn son of a [ __ ] [ __ ]

[13:01]
damn son of a [ __ ] [ __ ]
bastard son of a [ __ ] [ __ ]
what the [ __ ] [ __ ] sucking hell does
this happen
every [ __ ] time every [ __ ] time
but hey let's do it from the bright side

[13:15]
but hey let's do it from the bright side
okay we could have also he could have
also
made a straight flush no wait actually
that's literally not possible
that's really not possible how did we
not stick how did we not stack him here
you have to be joking i mean and trying

[13:31]
you have to be joking i mean and trying
not to be negative but
god damn [ __ ] [ __ ]
samir came to play oh samir
samir samir what you gonna do what you
gonna do when the wacko bets two big
blinds

[13:45]
blinds
hey guys this is what we call uh where
are we
where are we gonna say deliberate
deviates from the solver and then he
decided to try a little race this guy
comes in
okay starts raising straightaway

[14:02]
okay starts raising straightaway
i'm not curious
interesting

[14:24]
now he pots the river yeah listen
my friend uh i don't know who you are

[14:32]
my friend uh i don't know who you are
but if you have queen nine of clubs
then gg ace four clubs
okay gg

[14:48]
another flush river another [ __ ]
flush
river are you
oh my god [ __ ] god damn [ __ ]
sucker
you know i tried to i tried to put a

[15:01]
you know i tried to i tried to put a
move i trying to
induce him to get frisky but they just
didn't do it
and then the goddamn card comes they
always come to
damn time the [ __ ] goddamn flesh card
comes every goddamn time

[15:16]
comes every goddamn time
we made a little bit of a lucy easy lucy
cpu
here on the flop
i'm probably gonna do so again here on
the turn

[15:32]
but i think we shouldn't be in this hand
so if we end up losing a stack it's one
of these uh
s-blade scenarios
as if he checks we're going to bluff in
our stack

[15:46]
our stack
to be fair we
we don't really have much bluffs without
checks so
since we shouldn't have called this on
the flop so we're in a sort of a
sort of a lucky situation i would say oh

[16:08]
sort of a lucky situation i would say oh
and then he snap calls me with king
queen that means they were an unlucky
situation
okay well plate zero plate little piece
of dark chocolate

[16:15]
of dark chocolate
never did anyone bad unless you eat too
much
power three bad days queen suited

[16:36]
decent flop

[17:01]
[Music]
uh not the barrel
barrel nothing down

[17:26]
to triple or not to triple that's not a

[17:30]
to triple or not to triple that's not a
question
uh he never has jacks
i never can have nines that's unlikely
you can have ajax suited but that's one
combo
he dunks hey

[17:53]
he never really has an asa
i don't think we can raise ace queen can

[18:00]
i don't think we can raise ace queen can
we raise ace queen
he promised he doesn't really have worse
so
oh he had sixes okay gg
gg father god
damn son of a [ __ ] [ __ ]

[18:15]
damn son of a [ __ ] [ __ ]
bastard son of a [ __ ] [ __ ] why
the [ __ ] [ __ ] sucking hell does this
happen
every [ __ ] time oh guys
it is not going away

[18:31]
it is not going away
but you know but that's the past at this
point
i'm not sure what's gonna happen next
but i mean i'll figure it out
i'm smart enough i'll figure it out guys
come on i'm smart enough
we can figure this out guys we can
figure this out
this is considered a good board

[18:49]
and i'll start off with a little ten
percent
ten percent for the for the fans of the
stream
i also start off with a three bet

[19:02]
here with the knight and suited first mr
ospu
we got a call

[19:19]
what are we gonna do here
i'm gonna go for another small bit

[19:39]
i'm gonna go for another small bit
get a call

[20:04]
hmm

[20:15]
just because not a very dangerous board
like i don't think he has deuces trees
or sixes all that often so i'm just
gonna bat

[20:30]
and hope that he folds something random
[Music]
like jack queen suited or something
if he races i'm not that happy but i

[20:46]
if he races i'm not that happy but i
think we're gonna get it in
yeah especially versus a small race he
sometimes will have
a bluff then he can fold he will
sometimes have a flush draw
then we're doing quite well we're

[21:00]
then we're doing quite well we're
blocking aces if he has queens or jacks
you know
we have decent equity but he has
literally the worst card
the the worst hand possible which is
pocket asus
so that is very unfortunate for us
that was literally the only uh the only

[21:16]
that was literally the only uh the only
ad i'm i was concerned about i think he
played his hand excellent we make that
very clear to you oh we draw a little
four bet here with the a7 versus mr
uh need to my three

[21:35]
he calls
flop ace high

[21:52]
i'll start with a little bit

[22:13]
and here in the two my three decides to
go for the check check check

[22:16]
go for the check check check
for the check raise check check check i
will just go for the check
and uh i show down here pocket nines
interesting that he didn't bet the turn
i would say that that's that's
definitely a hand that i would consider
betting the term with

[22:58]
okay

[23:01]
see that check back race
[ __ ] you got my the [ __ ] you got

[23:27]
ah nothing he was just joking around

[23:30]
ah nothing he was just joking around
while we forbade the pocket queens
let's go pocket queens i seriously
because queens are
i love yesterday everything with queens
he erased he had he brought
no king races we're all in baby we're

[23:45]
no king races we're all in baby we're
all in this is it this is a big moment
of truth
this is it either we wing everything or
we lose everything but we
come on baby there we go tense is a good
hand for us
no no
what the [ __ ] you [ __ ]

[24:02]
what the [ __ ] you [ __ ]
the [ __ ] [ __ ] i lost everything
poor guy poor guy
we just took it down we just took it
down pocket queen's also going for the
long run

[24:15]
long run
or are we going for the short run gonna
go for the short run here with pocket
queens
one time
can we not get stacked one time

[24:33]
can we not get stacked one time
just one time can we just not get
stacked one time

[24:46]
