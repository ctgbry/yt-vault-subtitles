&gt;&gt; Obviously, I went for the shove here,

[11:18]
&gt;&gt; Obviously, I went for the shove here,

[11:18]
&gt;&gt; Obviously, I went for the shove here,
you know? It's pretty obvious play.

&gt;&gt; That's a um

[11:31]
&gt;&gt; That's a um

bit of a bigger sizing though.

[11:37]
bit of a bigger sizing though.

[11:37]
bit of a bigger sizing though.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean I think this is uh this is

[11:39]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean I think this is uh this is

[11:39]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean I think this is uh this is
kind of reasonable to

[11:41]
kind of reasonable to

[11:41]
kind of reasonable to
&gt;&gt; specifically for my hand. I think it's

[11:42]
&gt;&gt; specifically for my hand. I think it's

[11:42]
&gt;&gt; specifically for my hand. I think it's
really beneficial, right?

[11:45]
really beneficial, right?

[11:45]
really beneficial, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You you like really want that

[11:47]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You you like really want that

&gt;&gt; Yeah. You you like really want that
queen 10 to fold

[11:50]
queen 10 to fold

[11:50]

&gt;&gt; and like like the five six the seven six

[11:52]
&gt;&gt; and like like the five six the seven six

[11:52]
&gt;&gt; and like like the five six the seven six
the sixes are going to be inelastic

[11:53]
the sixes are going to be inelastic

[11:53]
the sixes are going to be inelastic
anyway. So a little bit of extra benefit

[11:55]
anyway. So a little bit of extra benefit

we're a bit more forced to really size

they will still call and therefore I

definitely think like bet three ben is
going to be very effective uh in both

[41:05]
going to be very effective uh in both

bluffing here. Um so you just run into

[41:19]
bluffing here. Um so you just run into

[41:19]

less auto folds.

[41:21]
less auto folds.

[41:21]
less auto folds.
&gt;&gt; I think with you know we're aspecting

Um, so I think which kind of makes

[41:33]
Um, so I think which kind of makes

Um, so I think which kind of makes
playing back with this sort of hand

[41:34]
playing back with this sort of hand

by river. I mean you know you can still
justify that play. You can throw the

[41:48]
justify that play. You can throw the

[41:48]
justify that play. You can throw the
blockers out the window if you think

[41:49]
blockers out the window if you think

[41:49]
blockers out the window if you think
he's called folding a turn. Um,

[41:53]
he's called folding a turn. Um,

he's called folding a turn. Um,
yeah. It's kind of like it's almost like

[41:56]
yeah. It's kind of like it's almost like

[41:56]
yeah. It's kind of like it's almost like
I I kind of rather have a worse draw so

[41:58]
I I kind of rather have a worse draw so

[41:58]
I I kind of rather have a worse draw so
that I'll have better blockers on river.

[42:00]
that I'll have better blockers on river.

[42:00]
that I'll have better blockers on river.
If the idea is he has like a bunch of

call fold then it's like

[42:06]
call fold then it's like

[42:06]
call fold then it's like
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I would much rather go with the

I can just jam river you know.

[42:13]
I can just jam river you know.

[42:13]
I can just jam river you know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[42:14]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[42:14]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So I uh

[42:15]
&gt;&gt; So I uh

[42:15]
&gt;&gt; So I uh
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can jam river guiltree.

[42:16]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can jam river guiltree.

[42:16]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can jam river guiltree.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly.

[42:17]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly.

[42:17]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly.
&gt;&gt; And then this one Yeah. So my evaluation

[42:20]
&gt;&gt; And then this one Yeah. So my evaluation

[42:20]
&gt;&gt; And then this one Yeah. So my evaluation
was similar to you. I thought like okay

also the fact that we didn't really want

range. Just top of mind.

[43:51]
range. Just top of mind.

[43:51]

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I'm I'm just I'm just wondering

[43:53]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I'm I'm just I'm just wondering

[43:53]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I'm I'm just I'm just wondering
if we'd want to go more like well like

[43:57]
if we'd want to go more like well like

[43:57]
if we'd want to go more like well like
going 3x pot is usually

[44:00]
going 3x pot is usually

[44:00]
going 3x pot is usually
that's like a 95% plus equity hand. And

[44:04]
that's like a 95% plus equity hand. And

[44:04]
that's like a 95% plus equity hand. And
so then if it if it gets more than 5%

[44:06]
so then if it if it gets more than 5%

[44:06]
so then if it if it gets more than 5%
then then you want to go more like you

[44:09]
then then you want to go more like you

[44:09]
then then you want to go more like you
might want to go more 150.

[44:12]
might want to go more 150.

[44:12]
might want to go more 150.
Um, I'm I'm I'm still down to like dunk

Um, I'm I'm I'm still down to like dunk
and like dunk big. I'm just like not

[44:18]
and like dunk big. I'm just like not

[44:18]
and like dunk big. I'm just like not
100% on the size, but like this is also

[44:21]
100% on the size, but like this is also

[44:21]
100% on the size, but like this is also
I mean this also has more of a fear
