the mechanics of Poker podcast today
episode number five today we have
another high stakes cash game player on
tuning in live from the beaches in
Brazil when he is not at the beach
celebrating Carnival drinking kinas
while cheering on his favorite foodball
Club Gro he plays six Max and heads up
online cash games all the way up to
2550 he is the co-founder of the
Brazilian poker crew we're talking about
Matos zon G morise I hope I pronounced
that correctly Adam what are you looking
forward to talk with Mr Z well first of
all I'm impressed with that
pronunciation I'm sure it was close
thank much very good and yeah I'm
excited to get this guest done today he
said a very diverse background from mtts
to cash games to a stake and stable he
had a background in business you went to
business school as well so I'm really
interested to hear how he's been able to
transition through the stakes as a poker
player and all the shifts he's made the
the growth is had to doing mindset and
performance to to get to the top so yeah
lots of topics to cover and I'm excited
to see where this conversation goes how
about yourself R what are you looking
forward to
today well for the for the loyal
followers probably already know usually
before we have a guest on we make them
feel out some questions so we can kind
of get an idea of what to talk about if
there's some interesting stuff and he
was actually the first guy to have
filled in a lot of things differently
than the rest I would say he labeled
himself a bit more as an exploitative
player always trying to find an edge
over his opponent likes complicated
strategies whereas usually people that
have come on the PA so far are very GTO
oriented try to play their range well uh
use simplified strategies so I'm very
curious to dive a little bit into his
playing philosophy and also his coaching
philosophy and uh yeah see why he
chooses these kind of strategies why he
thinks this gives him a bigger atch than
maybe simplifying or playing more P GTO
strategies BAS basically so without
further Ado let's have him
on welcome Matos Z to the
Pod thanks man uh appreciate a lot to be
part of this podcast uh thank you for
the invite and let's do a great
job no worries or may maybe I should
have should have started as they taught
me in Rio
for the Brazilian Watchers you know this
is how they how Brazilians speak when
they meet up or at least especially in
Rio de Janeiro where I have quite a
history very slangy city right extra
slang compared to the rest of Brazil
yeah they're like the most the most ones
the ones that uh do the ls like the most
in in Brazil for
sure yeah they they really love it some
and some people even exaggerate they
cannot they they they cannot say one
sentence without slanging or swearing
they love to slang and swear yeah it's
it's where are you from in Brazil I'm
from the the South like the very south
uh sunel is it h one of our states uh
but I live in kurba uh that is Parana
that is South also another States from
another stat from the south and I live
there like uh from my seven seven year
seven years old so 90 1997 so long time
ago I'm basically a Kur chano guy from
Kur CH Kur chano yeah and I I checked
out your Instagram a big gamio supporter
I saw yeah yeah Gru is from this other
state that I told you that is H and I'm
a very very big fun
yep just like all the all the Brazilians
right they love football yeah I love it
because I I saw you do it a lot with
your girlfriend or actually F fiance I
should say now right yeah exactly it's
very common in Brazil you know it's like
you go with your girlfriend watch
football drink a beer where it's you
know in the rest of the world it's more
like sort of a thing you go do with your
friends with your meal friends basically
yeah but I love it in Brazil it's a
couple thing yeah yeah yeah it is I mean
it can be both uh you I have some
friends that like they girlfriends wife
they don't like that much but it can be
a a couple thing it can be it can be
both I I go sometimes with only friends
sometimes I go alone sometimes I go with
my f so yeah we just love I really like
that
yeah so at this at this podcast Mr Matos
by the way I said Matos Kon Jor correct
pronunciation Matel Matel was
was uh South X accent and Matos is like
more a real accent and Northeast accent
so you can say both but yeah I would say
mat
Mor Matos all right mat well this
podcast we are generally very curious
how long it took for players to get to
high stakes right it's something that's
often forgotten you see players at high
stakes and you kind of assume that they
were always there but usually there's
quite a road before right and we like to
ask uh the guest that we have on how
long it took you answered around six
years which is so far what I've seen
quite normal maybe even a little bit on
on the shorter side um we are obviously
very curious to talk about this journey
in this podcast and I wanted to start it
off with another common team around
poker players that we have had on which
is that they were very competitive you
mentioned Sports tennis foot football f
ball as they say in Brazil and games
Counter Strike could you uh could you
talk a little bit about those times
yeah so very nice
question um I started very early with
sports like getting in touch with sports
so I started football at when I liveed
in Rio so I live at two years there also
uh when I was very young so six years
old I started with football seven years
old I started with tennis and I started
to to appear in competitions especially
in tennis uh more or less like with nine
10 and my career wasn't that long but I
was like always always there uh playing
the state compet the competitions on the
state uh some Brazilian competitions
also and actually I I I always had that
in my life like that competition so I
started with football then I went to to
tennis I I I did both like in the same
in the same time and I remember that
when I when I quitted both like with 14
years old then I started uh Counter
Strike stuffs then I started music also
that I didn't mention and I think it's
something a little bit different but it
have a little not not the competition
itself but the learning process I think
uh it helped me a lot so my life was
always like um changing about
competition uh little bit of music and
like The Passion of The Passion of
football also so Gro is in my life like
since I I know myself so
yeah yeah so when you when you basically
mentioned music you don't necessarily
mean that you are very competitive but
when you do something you're very driven
to get very good at it yeah I would say
that and it was something very curious
uh something that that I think it's very
very curious is that I worked with music
like I played uh in nightclubs Etc since
14 years old uh 14 15 16 17 18 and then
I stopped for a bit worked in other
stuffs and then I got back as a manager
of a band and I remember that feeling of
like missing competition you know I
remember uh I was like working as a
manager
and like I I like it to do this work as
a manager as getting things around uh
businessman like getting the shows Etc
and then I was like when I was looking
at the concert I was like where's the
competition here like I I was like
thinking in my brain and that was
something that I missed for this time so
I I I think like always get in touch
with this feeling like helped me you
some way for for
sure you are uh are you are you a good
loser I think I can I can answer that in
both ways like I think yes in the sense
that I always try to look um try to
learn something but at the same time I
don't like to lose of course so it can
be a good one and a bad one in the same
sentence
I have to ask that because uh for the
people don't know I'm married to a to a
Brazilian and when we play games and she
loses you know I have to I have to go
hide especially if I'm the one beating
her because you know Brazilians they
quite expressive with their emotions so
if you have a sore loser competitive
Brazilian I can imagine you smashed a
lot of things along the way or you're
not that expressive in
losing yeah know I I smashed a lot uh of
stuffs like my hand mouth
a lot of stuff in my
career yeah when you um so you were you
said that you were a manager at a band
but you kind of missed the competitive
the competitive nature was at the same
time you were playing Counter
Strike no no Counter Strike was earlier
like I played Counter Strike I think uh
from started with 13 years old kind of
the same kind of in the same
uh time frame that I was like playing
football and Tennis I played both like
for a long time and then I kind of
quitted because I was like a little bit
done with that I was a little bit burned
out of doing a lot of stuffs and I
started with seven so you can imagine
for a kid like 12 13 years old I was
like I don't want to do that anymore I
just want to hang out with friends and
do something that is more funny or and
and then was uh I don't know if it
happens in in all of the world but in
Brazil that was a big big explosion of
like lung houses like a lot of lung
houses going everywhere and we used to
go there so I think that um inflate for
sure like my burned out of sports and I
just wanted to to go in in the front of
computer and playing Counter Strike Etc
then it started like Counter Strike
teams Etc and started to to to compete
also uh and then it was like I played
like for two or three years like till 14
15 and then music go went on on my life
so I always had like something uh
something to inut my my efforts in a
competition way or uh I always had
something uh Beyond like school so to to
inut like some activity that was like
first tennis then football then um
Counter Strike then music then poker
then music then poker so my life was
basically it and always like uh looking
a lot uh uh watching a lot Sports so I'm
a big sports fan also like I watch all
of the sports that you can like Olympic
Games I always watch everything so I'm
I'm very addicted to to to watching
sports and
yeah when you referring to like sort of
that as a burnout you think sometimes
especially when you're at a young age
you know you maybe just like you know
you just start to play tennis or
football or C because you you like it do
you think at some point that
competitiveness kind of got in the way
of it became no longer fun for you
because everything had to be done at a
competitive level yeah I think yes uh I
always I I remember a
very deep feeling that I had like in my
7 8 9 10 11 12 years old that was like I
was Monday and Monday W Wednesday I went
to
football uh Thursdays Tuesdays and
Thursday I went to to tennis classes so
I played both and then Friday I did like
one of one of each and uh weekend's
always some competition so I remember
that the burnout came like when I was I
think I was 133
yeah 13 years old then I was competing
at a
tennis uh smallest tournament something
like that versus a friend of mine that I
used to to train with him and I remember
it was like
December uh my classes was gone like I I
was always like a good student so I
never went like uh I don't know how to
say that in I don't know how skip the
classes yeah yeah I I always like ended
the the year without having to to do
that those extra TS Etc so I remember
that I was like done with everything
meeting Counter Strike and I just wanted
to like rest and stay in my my home um
like playing Warcraft playing Counter
Strike those games and I remember I was
like playing a competition verus I
remember that I won the first the first
set in the tennis and I was like so done
that I was like losing the second set
and I say hey man I like to my friend I
don't want to play anymore like you can
you can want the game like you can have
it you can have it and I and and I left
like in the middle of it and I said to
my dad like Dad I don't want to play at
least I just I just want to rest I just
want vacations and I started to to be
more like a um computer games fan and
then I I quitted like soccer and and
Tennis then I went like to play
recreationally but never
went to that uh professionally anymore
you know you you had any trouble then if
you afterwards if you play something
competitive and try to become really
good do you have trouble to afterwards
then just play it for fun knowing that
you know for example if I I really like
to play football as well and then
sometimes when I go play I'm like ah I
want to play more than once a week
because if then I can be better and
sometimes it can frustrate me like my
head wants to do something but then my
feet they say uhuh said the ball goes
completely somewhere else like oh if I
would play more often you know I can get
better at this yeah I definitely can
relate with with that feeling cuz
um
um I I can I can say
that it happened to me with Counter
Strike nowadays like uh my my I have a
an
older uh brother that he is a doctor and
he loves Counter Strike and he plays
with guys that are like first like my
friend friends you know like they're
friends also but they're like my friends
from the school Etc and they love to
play Counter Strike and they say say
always say to me like he man let's play
with us let's play with us and I like
stay I already stay uh a very long time
in the front of in the front of computer
like playing poker teaching class and I
say like guys I'm not going to play
because I'm not going to play well I'm
not going to play competitive and like I
don't want to stay like more time in the
front of computers so like forget I'm
I'm for forget about it I'm not going to
play so definitely I think the both
feelings but definitely not being able
to be good at it at a at some level uh
it like I don't want to play because of
that also you know yeah it takes the
enjoyment a little bit out of I played I
played a little bit of Counter Strike
myself as well you but you were probably
even younger generation the the 1 point
was it 1.6 they called it right CR
strike 1.6 yeah yeah 1.6 actually I did
the I did the how do I say I did the
transition for I started at 1.3 so 1.3
and 1.5 and I remember the biggest
transition was 1.5 to 1.6 because it
changed like a lot of the stuff 1.3 to
1.5 was kind of similar but yeah I
remember 1.6 1.5 to 1.6 was a big big
change and then you even which which one
came after
that Force yeah yeah I think Source came
that is the one that I played quite a
lot yeah but I remember then I I I later
I played it again and then you know you
hear in the chat all all these like 12y
old kids giving you head shots all the
time no fun yeah yeah come on I'm
getting I'm getting outplayed left or
right you know especially if you're if
you like to win then then just sitting
in there getting head shot within a
second they just evolved so much I
remember that when I first when I first
got in touch with that was at long
houses so we play it as our friends Etc
and I remember in Brazil it was like uh
I think it was
2000 1 2002 yeah 2001 2002 when I
started playing and I remember that like
at least in Brazil we didn't have like
um internet that you could like stay
long like we stay noway like you gotta
uh like dial up internet I don't
remember yeah dial up like you got got a
call so the internet was very bad so you
couldn't play in your house so we just
went to L houses so I I remember I
stayed like long uh frag nights I don't
know if you guys had had that in yeah in
your country so yeah we just had like a
lot of frag nights and I remember that
when ADSL Ming get to Brazil like 2002 I
don't know like it was a big thing like
oh my God now we can play like from our
houses then I stayed to like to play in
in my home and then like this generation
came after like that everyone just plays
in in their houses nowadays with awesome
internets
Etc long live long live ADSL to bring us
poker but I can definitely also relate
to that what what you're saying I
remember I used to play a lot of video
games uh I used to play a lot of FIFA uh
but then when I started to play poker
online poker professionally you already
spent so much time behind your computer
it's like when I'm when I'm done I don't
really feel like playing another game
behind my computer it's like it's it's
no longer relaxing for me you know
you're already so exhausted Al also what
you said with the coaching as well like
everything you do is already behind your
computer you also live in a beautiful
country to go outside right go go visit
the beach you know lovely weather even
though you know when you live in the
south it can get a little bit
chilly but still you know very nice and
sunny weather uh I'm sure Adam can also
relate to uh I mean you you were
competitive in running if I believe I
was I had a similar kind of sports
background where I did more Sports at
school and my parents my dad in
particular used to be a middle distance
Runner so he got me into the running
club at about age 11 and I was better
than at that than I was at the other
sports I was trying so because I was
getting a few wins under my belt I
decided to train kind of full-time
middle distance running and yeah I
competed in events around the country
for about eight to 10 years up until I
started poker really in
2011 so yeah I had a sporty background
but yeah kind of similar urge to want to
compete and yeah my urge was always
competing against myself I liked running
for that kind of kind of selfish reasons
where I dictated all the variables if I
was getting better it was up to me
whereas team sports my teammates could
let me down and I wouldn't know if I was
improving so I did like that linear
progression of beating my times whilst
also trying to beat the competition so
I'd like to know with you um when you're
very competitive you said yeah you got
drawn to competition what is it for you
about competition that you feel
resonates with you what do you get from
being in competitive environments that
gives you that that feeling of being
alive that it what is in the competition
that I like oh nice um well I got to
think about this one I was uh kind of
relating with you in the sense
of um what you said about yourself and
like that your teammates could like mess
up with your results Etc I I had this
feeling exactly on the band that I that
I told you guys like I was managing the
band finishing um my University and I
was thinking like dude
like those guys are like because because
it wasn't something like very
professional like in my in
my in my band there there was guys that
had like their main work as another
stuff so I couldn't hand some stuffs I
couldn't hand handle that like I
couldn't uh make
that make that like the main thing for
them so it was very very hard and I
remember like I already had had uh in
contact with poker Etc so I was already
think I was thinking about something
like I want to do something that is up
only to me like only my efforts and I I
don't wanna like depend on any other
person you know so that was very very
related I know it's it's not related to
your question but what I like in
competition I I could say like in
individual competition that only your
effort uh it's what like it's only up to
you so you're 100% responsible for your
results unless like of course like uh
short terms uh variance or especially on
entities that you don't get like this
100% full but what I would say to
individual competitions is that uh in
competition
itself I'm really not
sure I'm really not sure I I think only
the only the nature of it like the
nature of you
to to have the competition you know
because in some in some business in some
environments you have the competition
also but it's not like uh the exactly
the nature as a game you know exactly
the nature as a game so I think just
having that as a nature is something I I
don't know maybe maybe we can we can
think a little bit more and see why is
that I'm not sure exactly why but I
think just the nature of having
something that uh that have this
competition is something that I really
enjoy you did actually you have an older
brother
right
yeah I remember in our last podcast was
it with goose Adam yeah the
competitiveness also got triggered by
his older brother did you maybe
experience something the same that you
always wanted to beat your brother
already since a young
age I don't think so I don't think so
his like six years uh older than me he
was he's way more nerd nerd than than me
you know like all of the games like
Street Fighter all of the stuff he was
always the the older one and and I was
always like watching him play because he
was like way older than me and way
better than me in a lot of stuff so we
kind of didn't get this competition you
know like I remember he was like third
uh 14 and I was eight so he was the one
like he had like always way better the
Gap is just too big yeah yeah I didn't
like compete with him too much I
remember just competing
uh together with him a lot uh watching
him and yeah I I I didn't have this
competition with him a lot for
sure yeah yeah I think the nature of
competition is often putting in effort
towards a very specific outcome often
winning or achieving something whether
that's in a team environment where
you're trying to win a football match or
you're trying to uh run faster in a race
or beat be your OPP at tennis it's I'm
going to put maximum effort my best self
into this to try to get an outcome that
I want I think that in itself those kind
of characteristics are very appealing to
people have a growth kind of mindset
they want to be challenging themselves
and I'm the same if you uh do something
that isn't competitive like say we don't
keep score we play tennis and there's no
scorecard I'm hitting it out every time
as soon as there's a scorecard I'm like
right [ __ ] rolled up I'm getting serious
it brings out a certain character trait
in me because there's a score so like
there's effort rewarded to that so yeah
I think it's even though it's hard to
quantify I think for you it sounds like
the effort towards an outcome seems to
resonate with your your personality all
right so let's transition from your C
Counter Strike days towards poker we've
got this kind of competitive kids we've
got playing football and sports we've
got going to counter strike in your kind
of early teen years talk for like when
you started to uh transition out of that
or was there any significant Parts
towards your late te early 20 years
before you you got into
poker Yeah so
basically my life uh was like uh I I I
met poker with 15 years old and was just
a fun game uh meeting with the guys in
in school Etc and I remember like my
actually I had I had contact with my
brother first in 2014 but was very small
stuff and then we started playing like
in 15 16 17 and I remember that um I had
contact with uh guys that went
professional super early like uh our
friend in common Renee vinu and Yuri uh
you guys know Yuri zesi and he's like
one of the the best players in the world
of mtts uh the ner guy for the ones that
doesn't know he's like he was in my band
one of those bands that I played he he
played with me and I remember that he he
he's like one year one year um younger
than me and then he started to to do
this transition to Poker like even early
so I liked poker I likeed to play Etc
and I had like some examples that was
him and his older brother that is vino
that uh we have in common and they were
like uh already professionals like in
2018 uh 2008 2009 they started super
early so I always had like uh contact
with people that went full in poker so
it wasn't like another world to me you
know like I had contact with poker like
15 at 15 I remember my brother watching
Like Money Maker boom my my brother
watching watching on ESPN so it was like
okay this is a game this is a this is a
ability game or whatever sport whatever
you want to call um so I always had this
content with poker it wasn't something
like from other world like people see
today like even even nowadays I say like
oh I'm professional poker player oh yeah
yes oh you can live with that BL like
always that that common thought so poker
was always kind of a thing to me you
know I always knew that was an industry
I always knew that was a fair game uh
etc etc so I had contact with that and
at my 19 in
2009 uh like doing school I went to law
school then uh playing poker music like
all of those things things in my life I
I I tried to go pro like in in like in
my 19 it didn't work so it didn't work
well um I had to do another stuffs of my
life and then I got back like with 24
years old 25 like now I'm GNA be a
professional poker player and then I I
just went through that don't know if I
answered your question with perfect so
what happened from 19 to 24 which
allowed you to transition into being a
professional you failed the first time
what lessons did you learn over that
five years that allowed you to be
successful the second time I think just
mat like like to be more more mature I I
don't know exactly why I went to I
finished University I remember that in
2009 I had a ex-girlfriend that she
wasn't any supportive like of course our
our family like I lived with my mom
um my mom and my dad they're both like
militaries so they're like very safe
with money like getting salary etc etc
so that was always a taboo for me like
to be entrepreneur and and I kind of
always had like the the soul of
entrepreneur or of going like uh I never
liked this idea of like just being like
super regular something you know I
always had that in my mind and when in
2009 remember uh I played s goals and
mgts and I remember this exgirlfriend
wasn't like in supportive like oh polker
what the [ __ ] is that like she was
like she hated it and I kind of was very
influen by that and for sure uh I didn't
have the like the professionalist
required for sure also and I I I think I
just had to do like normal things in
life you know like got a regular job uh
to get uh a degree in University to do
the things that your family want to do
like your mom your dad my brother was
like doing medicine my my dads are um
dentists and Military so I kind of had
to be part of a normal stuff first to be
able to do something else maybe no
pressure no
pressure no pressure yeah yeah so yeah
was kind of kind it's interesting
sometimes we've got to please those
around us take a few boxes and almost
like yeah please our family our friends
and then we get to decide what we
actually want to do it sounds like for a
long time you had your own inclin that
you didn't want to be in a kind of a
safety first job occupation long term so
for you when you were 24 and things
started to work out what was some the
early kind of expectations you had at
that stage because you had some friends
who obviously were professional a lot
younger so you had some role models to
look up to what were your early
expectations 24 when you were starting
to figure things out when you went pro
oh that's that's a very cool question
very very interesting ones because yeah
I felt that pressure because uh all my
friends had like regular jobs uh play uh
uh working on very big companies Etc
with did like so I was always very
confident I always had a very good conf
confidence like in in myself and in my
potential um so I expect
to to do that like and to be veryx
successful like from from the beginning
like 2015 I started playing MTS and I
had a very big expectation after the
first year my first year I think it was
good like if you're going to compare
with the average but it wasn't like
super and I was like expecting some the
stuff to happen a little bit uh faster
so was kind of and I and I Chang it to
to cash games so when I change it to
cash games I think my expectations
wasn't that huge I just wanted to like
you said like just pay the bills and Etc
and things like I think if you're going
to compare to to when I started like in
2015 I think uh it was something that I
aimed more like when where the things
went uh I think it kind
of uh get there but if you're going to
compare like with my second year that
was when I changed to catch games then
definitely like it went way better than
than I expected so um I I had the both
both feelings but when I
started uh I had very big expectations
not to make millions not to be like
playing high stakes but to be successful
you know to to have a a good life and to
to learn more than the average uh job
that I that I could make with my to with
my business degree you
know were there any challenges you ran
into in your first or second year either
when you're playing mtts or when you're
transition to cash games which made you
maybe doubt yourself and question it
sounds like you had a kind of inbuilt
self-confidence that you were going to
be successful one way or another did
that confidence get shaken at any point
in the first few years of your journey
just the reality you know because when
you when you're looking from outside you
can think things are easier uh in the
sense of getting the that long term or
getting the results because you in poker
you just do a lot of work and you do a
lot of researches and you study and you
play and study and play and you think
you deserve the stuff like uh faster
than you actually get it so I think it's
just the reality and just uh the daily
basis work that just I just face it
their reality and then see like okay
it's not that easy it's not just in
putting the work uh every day uh like it
is but you gotta wait for for the long
time you you need to to get the hours to
get better to to get very good you know
so I think uh I just was when this first
year passed I was just happy if I could
like just stay at a normal level but
then then the it's kind of the things
happen it I see as the things happen a
little bit with a delay you know
sometimes you're just okay I'm I'm I'm
good with that I'm good with what's
happening and then you're just oh okay
I'm gonna play a little bit higher okay
I'm I'm crushing okay I'm gonna play
higher and then the the things start
like okay like the things are happen
right now like I didn't expect that to
happen anymore and it's just happening
you know like it's I don't know if I if
I could explain pretty well what the
feeling perfect yeah I completely agree
with that kind of philosophy where
you've got to put the work in you've got
to be patient and sometime life works
with this delay effect where you don't
get the rewards up front for your
efforts then all of a sudden a few
dominoes fall over and before you know
you're getting more success than you
expected because you put the work in
earlier and sometimes it's a frustrating
process because as you're putting the
work in early you're not getting the
results I work with players a lot on
this topic where they're getting
frustrated because they're putting
effort in and they feel like they're
doing everything right but the results
they're getting back onto alignment with
what they think they should get and it's
a very frustrating period but like you
said that delay effect I like that even
terminology because if you can install
that into your kind of belief system
that life's got this delay effect if I
work hard I'm not going to get the
instant rewards but if I just keep at it
with a patient mindset I will get to the
the outcomes I want eventually so yeah I
like that philosophy so for yourself
when did things really start to pick up
so we've got this kind of transition to
cash games in your second year it sounds
like that was a good fit for you H when
did things start to really pick up and
when did you start having some notable
success in cash games um I think the Su
the success itself in the in the results
it came in
2018 so I got like uh I played mtts for
one year uh for
backer um and I play I could reach like
I started from playing like dollar game
$1 Games Etc and I could reach like 25
average buying and when I when I left
MTS I went to play for myself uh I I I
don't think like teams or anything cfbs
already existed in cash games so I
played for myself started at 10nl
uh in 2015 2016 so I played 16 17 and
then in in 2018 from the beginning I was
already playing to 100 now so that was
where I get like the very good
results um but I already I was already
very
uh I I felt already very successful in
this journey because I was like learning
so much and already like studying a lot
and getting a a lot of knowledge so all
of this journey I already I didn't get
the results but I I was like a little
bit better than uh from 2015 in the
feeling that oh I'm I'm getting there
you know like I will get there I'm
pretty sure I will get there so when I
changed to cash to cash games 2016 was a
little a little hard to be honest but in
in late 2016 and 201 17 I had the
feeling that like sometime sometime the
ball will will get get to the goal you
know I had this feeling like uh so 2018
where uh was where I got the the the
very good results started to get the
very good results 2018 then 19 and then
it was like
better you said 2016 was hard what was
the challenge you ran into in
2016 uh first was the transition I
remember uh transitioning to from MTT to
C cash games I remember uh something
very in in in in my mind that I had was
like tournaments it's
always you kind of like play the early
game Etc and you start and you wait to
be playing a short game stack uh a short
game short stack game and you just like
get into your comfort zone like Reams uh
open jams Etc and then like the safety
and then I was play I was like okay
maybe I will transition to cash game
Let's Play that and I started to play
like I had no defense you know I was
like always in the spots like oh my God
where where my stacks all will be short
and where do I defend myself like I
don't I'm like in the The War Zone
everywhere like uh receiving punches and
like from from every from everywhere
like I'm getting crazy in there in that
so this one that then I sto it like I'm
I'm not going to play I'm just going to
study then I I got a jundas book uh a
lot of jundas classes
on card Runner card Runners yeah card
Runners yeah uh and then I started a
little bit with uh a little bit no I I I
went full in theory like uh full in
understanding from the beginning like oh
my God like I received two cards the
game started what the [ __ ] I'm going to
do you know like it started from the
basics uh starting to rebuild everything
because it it kind of I felt that when I
started on mtts I kind of started
already with uh some shortcuts and I
didn't understand the game full you know
like what's going on then I went full on
Theory started to build everything and
that was hard because I did all of that
and then I went to play and I didn't get
the results you know and
so I I think I just needed more uh more
practice I just needed like more time
and yeah then then then I started to
play you know I I did the transition so
in 2016 I kind of started to play as a
professional cash game player uh for
myself so it was a different type of of
challenge to play for myself like I'm My
Own Boss because I played for a backer
before so I kind of had that someone to
to ask someone to to to to ask for help
or something like that so I think those
were were the challenges like a new game
um a new strategy uh a new way of life
kind of and y basically
that yeah and throughout your career how
have you generally dealt with downswings
so especially as you've moved up stakes
and started experiencing new laws I'm
always very intrigued to know how people
deal with them both like mentally and
also the way like they kind of either go
back in the lab and study the way they
deal with self-doubt so yourself looking
at your put career especially up until
2018 on that kind of Journey towards
your the kind of more successful results
have you generally dealt with down
swings is there any down swings you
remember like a memorable down swing
which was particularly challenging for
you that we can dive into nice nice
question again um I'm more to I'm I was
never a guy especially I think only on
empties I played like more but then I
wasn't NE I was never uh uh hard grinder
in like in putting a lot of volume and
like just playing playing playing I was
always the guy of the study so I always
study a lot and when I start to have a
big downswing I always like increase my
hours of studying
always um always when I I think when I
face down swings I always try to reflect
what's going on and the vast majority of
my down swings were in the periods that
I lick study I lick routine always so
you always oh I'm going to do my routine
like I'm going to I don't know wake up
doing my morning routine study to hours
and play and I was always like
neglecting like one part of it like uh
not getting the morning routine like
waking up and like going to social
medias starting to chat anything like
missing some part of parts of it so when
always when I face down swings my down
swings were weren't never big big too
big like I remember one at 100nl in
201 17 to 2018 like when I was uh a
little bit before I move up I remember
was like close to 20 buyings it isn't
even a big one but I remember that the
pressure W was very big because I had
another another Stu in my life I
remember that I was feeling very anxious
because that's that's a cool thing to to
say I remember that I was like playing
hund now and I think if I got like my 10
NL 25 NL 50 NL and 100 NL sample I think
my run rate was like 5.5 BBS and playing
only Zoom so it was pretty high but I
was I wasn't I was kind of Del
delusional about results you know like
not that that I was delusional but I
remember that I that I found a site that
you guys maybe know like who TF like who
the [ __ ] are you I don't know if you
guys know that you got like uh other
guys results and I was looking at other
guys results and I was looking like two
BBS 2.5 BBS one BB 1.5b like everyone
and I was like oh my God like the down
swing will come like I'm beating at 5.5
no one is beating too high so like I'm
going to get there also like and I was
like I can't I can't have like a bigger
win rate than that so I started to have
a down swing and then like all of those
feelings like a lot of anxiety like oh
my God I'm not going to get there I'm
not going to have five BBS off win rate
I'm not going to have four I'm gonna
have like 1.5 or two like all of those
guys are having that you know like to
see how the other guys are doing and
normally like those results wasn't that
accurate or or the guys were just
playing super high volume in like
another time frame or any like a lot of
things but I couldn't uh realize that
that much what's what was going on I was
just looking to another stuff that
wasn't reality and just uh in putting
that to to to my reality and fear uh
like fearing uh the future or something
like that you know or my career for for
itself so I think it that that was the
like the worst feeling that I had in
this St swing because of these outside
events that happen but never after that
uh I was like never facing never facing
like uh very big down swings that I that
I couldn't deal with it or or anything
like
that yeah I think it's very interesting
there we said two things which I thought
were very good one when you are on a
down swing or approaching some bad
results you increase your study hours it
sounds like that's just a a default
thing that you do which is I think is a
great like lesson for all pocket players
because when you're on a down swing
you've got more self-doubt you need to
rebuild confidence there's probably more
spots to look over so I think it's just
a good rule of thumb when things aren't
going well just switch some of your
playing hours towards studying obviously
don't push it toward its extremes where
you don't play I think it's a really
good um yeah kind of overall rule of
thumb and you also said you reflect
reflect more so it sounds like for you
kind of bad results in down swings
probably just get you curious probably
get you in the lab more reflecting
studying and you probably just naturally
come out them quicker than most people
because you're just learning from them
and get improving your game
and then you also said almost like a
catalyst which causes Down swings was
always lack of studying and lack of
routine so it's almost like if you can
continue your study habits have a good
routine you're generally going to bring
your best game to the tables and that's
going to mitigate some of the effects so
yeah like like both sides which both
kind of hinged on your approach to
studying but yeah I think for you it's
probably a testament to your approach to
the game that you hav as many down
swings obviously what you were saying
there high win rates for the games
you're playing obviously that's going to
mitigate some of the swings you have as
well we are like that taking control
during those times and often during a
down swing the worst thing is we don't
know what's going to happen next we feel
like it might last forever like you said
when you was looking at other people's
win rates and the anxiety was building
that can go on for a long time if you
you let it so yeah for you going in the
lab studying more and controlling that
variable sounds like it's been highly
effective for you so as you said you
have a morning routine I was interested
to hear about that so he said your
morning routin is very important and if
you mess that up often going on your
phone would be a negative what are some
of the things you do early in your day
that get you in a good frame of mind to
perform well nice um just be 100% uh
honest and especially for the guys that
are that are listening to us uh it's
always a u i always fight with that also
you know like you always you're as a
human you you like to be in the comfort
zone so it's very easy to to get out out
of it so I'm always fighting that I'm
always remembering myself that I need to
do that so um my my plan is not always
like the way that I do because sometimes
I just wake up like uh later sometimes I
just uh get uh another commitment that I
like couldn't do and then and I you know
like th those stuffs happen but what I
like is and I always try to do that
first thing that I think it's the most
important one at least for me that I'm
that I like to go to to see social
medias to see news and Etc is to wake up
and not to get the phone you know like
not get your phone that's the the most
important stuff like thing that I have
to fight a lot but it's a thing that I
that I do that always when I do that I
feel that my day is way better so first
of first first stuff is wake up and not
get your phone first first of it then I
think meditation works I've been
neglecting that to be honest uh but I
think uh there there's not much uh stuff
just waking up uh feeling well not
rushing anything not one like if you
wake up and you have not that you have a
commitment but you have something that
you know you got to do in that day just
don't rush to do that you know like wake
up like brush your teeth
uh wash your face do whatever you want
like eat do your breakfast or go
meditate but just don't uh just don't
get your phone and start to rush
everything so I have a ve very basic one
I wake up I brush my teeth Etc do my
like I don't don't don't get shower or
anything like that just eat my breakfast
try to get a little bit of sun or
meditation not always I can have it
because I live in kurichi as soon as
knows so it doesn't have we don't have
much much sun uh and then I just go for
my for my schedule like what I have to
do like normally administrative stuffs
for for brpc so I do all all of the
stuff and normally I have coaching to do
so I start to get go go to my coachings
or if I have like study session with
Solo or if I have like um study session
for myself so I do all of the things
that I that I got do normally like my
days like there there's days that I only
coach there's days that I study and play
there's days that um I do both so
normally I do my morning routine as you
said and then I start my day with like
the things that I got to do and then I
just uh just follow my my schedule but I
have a schedule like for every day I
think that's good to it point also like
I always schedule at my my my coaches
are scheduled for the month so I build I
build a schedule for the month for all
the coaches and then I build uh I have
like Excel sheet very basic one with all
of the commitments like doctor like I
don't know things that that got out of
your routine of your normal schedule
like I have a doctor I have a dentist I
have a meeting like podcast I'm going to
put on my routine like now I'm in
vacation but but I normally like if I
have some meeting like that this one I
will in put on my routine so and then I
go to gym like 2:00 p.m. to
3:30 from Monday to Friday I'm at gym
with my personal trainer so very I have
a very rigid schedule to say like that
yeah yeah very interesting and yeah I
like what you said about often it's the
things that we don't do like don't check
your phone don't rush and I think often
we can lose our days or like at least
lose momentum in the day so quickly in
that first kind of 10 minutes to an hour
and it's really hard to get it back if
you start your day in bed on social
media you might think it's GNA be five
10 minutes of your time but you then try
getting back into a productive path
takes a lot of willpower and a lot of
kind of mental bandwidth just to get
back to where you were so yeah I think
often we can double down on like good
habits like you said meditation go to
the gym but first of all we need to make
sure we're not shooting ourselves in the
foot by yeah kind of checking fors and
yeah I've had a rule for probably it's
probably four is now where my phone's in
airplane mode for the first few hours of
my day and that's a good like kind of
protector for me if I pick up my phone
it's like oh there's no notifications
because I was a a sucker for responding
to people instantly now I'm kind Off the
Grid early it's just piece of mind to uh
yeah get get going with the things that
are most important then it sounds that
you've got a very good structure in
terms of scheduling the Big Blocks of
your day i' call it the big bricks in
terms of your coaching your kind of most
high priy things of the day and also
like things that need to be taken care
of like bills and do and things like
that that keeps you into place as well
so yeah it sounds like a overall well
structured and as long as you can avoid
the Temptations we're all human we have
temptations to go on social media
YouTube all get our own kind of U
devices that kind of add draw to them
sounds like you can stay on track quite
well so yeah I think going forward let's
talk about your transition from 2018
through to 2021 when did you start your
own Stak and stable and yeah to me
through that kind of transition into
being a player and a coach at the same
time and how that's that's one of of the
last few years for you okay so we built
uh brpc on 2019 we started in 2019 with
two
students
and um so 2018 was playing 200 NL played
200 NL for the whole year 20 2018 2019
also started it uh 200l and then I think
in the middle of 2019 I started my
transition to 500 zoom and I I already
had some we call in Brazil we call
horses but I'll call players because I
think it's better uh we had some players
and then we started to build the company
uh we started with two players we didn't
have any um name for for the company or
anything like that but then we uh we get
we got more guys and then we started to
to to build
company um so 2019 I I was I was already
coaching like giving private coachings
so I already had a schedule kind of that
but then the challenges uh became like
uh way bigger like when building a
company you gotta like there's so many
stuff that you got to do that is like uh
it's crazy like the amount of stuff so
all of my high stakes Journey was always
um coaching having uh the company having
administrative stuff and playing so
that's why I nowadays I can't have like
a very big volume and I'm like that's
the that's my biggest leak for sure um
so I started playing 20l on 2018 2019
200l to 500 zoom and then on late
20120 yeah late 2020 I started with uh
bigger shots at high higher
stakes and the transition to 500 to to
higher Stakes was tougher because I was
also transitioning from Zoom games to to
regular tables so that was a very big um
there was a that was a very big
challenge also because uh like the
nature is of the game is very different
you gota not not that you got a table
select but you got to open the tables
then there's like this effort uh another
bigger effort like imputed on on the
games but it was always like that you
know like having a time to study having
a time to coach having a time to uh go
administrative parts of the company and
and playing you know so it was always
like that and always climbing always
trying to climb the stakes and from
2020 late so all in all
2021 I'm playing basically only high
stakes
awesome so any challenges did you run
into whilst you were trying to uh move
to the high stakes that transition from
the zoom games to the r speeds did that
have any obstacles and also seems
impressive that you were both climbing
to the high stakes whilst growing the
business and solving all the business
problems simultaneously how did you
divide those did you have certain parts
of your week which were more business
related certain days where you dedicated
poker how did you manage growing the
business at the same time you were
progressing up up the stakes as well
nice yeah so
just being very very uh accurate on your
on your question Mondays I all I always
only in puted like
interviews uh meetings like meeting with
marketing uh meeting with our
instructors of the team uh interviews
meeting with my Associated Sal so that
was always like that like Mondays and
then Tuesdays I always inputed uh more
coachings so Tuesday like three
coachings for example uh coaching is
always before uh before my gym so like
noon in Brazil noon like Tuesday
Wednesday Thursday I'm always coaching
for example Tuesday I'm puted more
coaches uh in Wednesday like morning
routine coaching gym and then studying
and play uh so it's it's it's kind of
very well
structured um to be honest
this year that passed 2021 was the one
that I worked the most for the team and
last and last grind um so this was a
very big challenge uh I'm not the best
example because I licked a lot in that
uh like I'm H 2021 was the time that I
puted like the business and put at brpc
like in the front of anything uh we we
went from 45 players to 130 so it was a
very big uh growth so I had to be there
like uh building all the stuff
strategically in the in the in the
business so I I always had this idea
like brpc first brpc and coaching first
so if I couldn't get any uh everything
done on Monday if I couldn't get
anything done on Tuesday I went to
Friday to to Wednesday then I went to
Thursday and if I have time I I would
grind so basically like 2021 I I grinded
on
Fridays sometimes uh uh Saturdays
sometimes Sunday but basically like
grinding one or two days because the the
volume of work on the team was so big
and coachings uh started I started to
coach more also because we got gu more
guys going to H getting to high stakes
so yeah that was basically it MH yeah
sounds very well structured and you're
obviously very challenging to uh be kind
of growing two things simultaneously
your business and your poort career and
it sounds like you had a very good
Clarity of what was the hierarchy where
your time should be spent and you
designated de relative to uh what was
the highest value for for you at that
time so yeah very very disciplined very
structured I like that you've been able
to uh stick to that and yeah Ry I know
you've been waiting patiently any
questions you've got on what we've
talked about so far or his culture
philosophy or anything like that if I
can say something I think uh at the same
time that I have like less time to
invest on I don't know to grind or to
invest on my study I think two things uh
helping me a lot first is the stability
like MoneyWise because of the the team
for sure it helped me like to to to get
more bankroll and to be like more safe
in this journey of getting higher shots
and uh getting to high sakes and for
sure like um when you when you coach
when when you teach and you especially
when you coach very good players because
like I play I I I coach guys that play
like 2K andl so to co to coach those
guys that are very good you always you
always like it's you obligate yourself
to be like studying a lot and like
because if not like you're going to
you're going to get there and you have
nothing nothing to teach or you're going
to be like uh suffering bowling from the
very good guys so you you kind of like
you obligate yourself to just being in
the in the being the top of the industry
like studying and you know like it's you
don't have option so I have to coach the
guys that are very good I gotta have
stuff to to coach them so it's like an
obligation so I think I think that
helped me like it it it moved me from
like no don't have don't have don't
having an option like it gotta be
excellent or otherwise I'm [ __ ] you
know I can I can very strongly relate to
that when I started to do coaching also
in terms of you know you're like okay
now I suddenly have to explain other
people how to play poker okay and they
said to think okay well actually what am
I doing and they actually okay I think
I'm doing this and then someone point
you out yeah but that's actually not
really the way it works right yeah yeah
actually that's that makes sense so you
also notice a lot of leagues in your
game uh and you actually sort of then
answer the question like what I uh you
combin it very well like at rcfp for
example at our Max we had 18 guys uh but
I was not able to play next to it I'm
also a little bit not oh right I'll
removed a little bit I'm a perfectionist
so then when it came down to strategy I
wanted it to be perfect I wanted to make
sure that everything I said was well
research that I don't give leaks to
other players um in hindsight I think I
just did wait too much uh um but how do
you then deal with the fact that for
example my students as well they started
Rising through the stakes they became
very good they don't just automatically
assume that what I say is correct
anymore because you know they yeah they
they become very good as well and I
wasn't really putting in the volume
anymore how do you deal with
that I don't no I'm
kidding basically yeah we we can relate
in the same stuffs uh how do deal with
that is delegating basically delegating
uh a lot of stuffs in the in the company
so my plans for this year uh it's
basically that I think with three years
of company company is already very big
uh very well structured because we uh we
put it a lot of time like strategically
thinking about and how I deal with that
is I want to play way more this year I
want to challenge I I like I ra battle
it uh somewhat a lot in this in this
year uh because I didn't like I had to
play so I just like opened 5K and played
and whatever like I I just want to play
you know when I had the time I just
wanted to play so I play like basically
every game uh that was running and what
I want to do this year is to delegate
more especially administrative stuff we
already have a very good uh Team here
taking care of themselves but and we
have like a lot of good instructors on
the team also but I want to delegate
more I want to give I we all we already
have we already give a lot of freedom to
to our to our team to
our um structures and to our
administrative part marketing part Etc
but I want to delegate more I think
that's the only way uh if you have a big
company you just have to
to to have very good guys working with
you giving them more freedom giving them
uh the power to to to make the decisions
and then you gota because otherwise you
got to choose like if you're gonna if
I'm gonna like only take care of
administrative part like uh left the
study behind left the the grinding
behind but I don't want to do that I
don't think that's the time maybe
sometime like some uh in the future I I
can do that like retire from poker and
just do the administrative I don't know
but now I think I have a lot to do still
uh with playing so for this year that's
my biggest challenge so let's see let's
see how how it will work like in 2023 we
can we can talk again and that's like
okay Z how many hands to play how many
high stakes hands did you play could you
could you do that um but I think I I'm
going to be I'm going to be able to do
that and yeah I work with with a uh
psychologist also um every week so help
he helps me to do that and I think it it
worth mention that especially with Adam
here and
yeah I think that's I mean you have your
routine you already Meed personal
trainer you have a psychologist you
build a team around you which makes you
function better and actually
the your your co-founder Sal Salo Costa
am I saying that correctly yeah yeah Sal
Costa yeah SOLO you mentioned him quite
a lot when did you guys met I met Solo
in September of
2017 that's very accurate day time
location yeah I always remember uh like
I I always remember those like time
frames pretty well I remember uh I he
had a Blog on run it once and I
already um used to read that a lot and
then he made a Blog in a Brazilian Forum
then I just messaged him he had a study
group in in Skype Etc then I I I entered
on this study group we started to
chatting and I was I was really into MDA
stuffs that I that I got with uh with
Nick Nick Howard and then saulo wasn't
like very very big a very big fan of it
he wasn't do he wasn't doing that and I
was and I remember he was crashing like
100 zoom and then he started to have a
big down swing then it was like oh let's
do MDA Stuff Etc and I was like dude
like was three months ago I said to you
for us to do that and he was like like
ah this doesn't this [ __ ] doesn't work
ET
and I was like I mean when when you're
upswinging you know the necessity is not
really there but when you're down
swinging you're automatically more open
to alternative ways right yeah exactly
then we started to work together uh like
we just uh we we when I read his blog
and he was Brazilian also Etc I was like
this guy is is
very he's
very he looks like me like how how he
deals with studies he's like very
organized uh I think he's like cognition
or his smart guy so I I I I read his
blog and I said like this guy can can be
a good partner you know and then I
messaged him and then we could rela in a
lot of stuffs and then he had the idea
of doing a cfp uh he was like man okay
yeah because when you said partner you
mean study partner not necessarily
business partner yeah yeah we we just we
were study partners before the the brpc
like like 2018 we were studying together
and exchange ideas like he was a friend
for sure and then he was like oh I have
this idea of doing a cfp etc and I was
with that with that mindset that I that
I already told Adam like I don't want I
want I don't want to depend on anyone I
don't want to teach anyone like I was
kind of arrogant like No One's Gonna Do
like the work that that we did man like
No One's Gonna we're gonna uh learn that
that in that way that fast like like
forget that like dealing with people
you're crazy like you know I was very
uh yeah yeah I was very skeptical and
against doing stuff like I just wanted
to to do my work on uh on my time uh
with my
freedom just playing my game and earning
my my money but it was a a nice surprise
that that I that I enjoyed
I wrote this question down for a little
bit later down the line but I'll ask it
now because indeed you as you just
brought it up how do you deal with the
fact that because you told that you it's
very frustrating for you um uh you're
very competitive how frustrating is it
for you when you for example see your
students not showing the same
competitiveness that you would show that
your students are not showing the same
routine and discipline that you would
show the fact that for example uh
because I've experienced this as well
like you have control over the outcome
of your cfp results right but it's not
100% control because in the end they
still have to do what you say that that
they're going to do how how does it work
if people just you know don't show the
same competitiveness and dedication that
you show they're out or how do you deal
with
it
man I'm gonna I'm going to answer that
100% honest my expectations was so low
that the work that the guys show are so
better than I expected that I'm just
happy you know because even though they
liak and they don't show like my
expectations back there were so low like
I was so skeptical and so didn't have
hope on that that I'm I'm just very
surprised in the in the good in the good
way you know like I'm just I'm just
happy and grateful for that so I'm just
grateful for that I met so many good
guys and the guys are are are amazing so
I'm more like an optimistic in this way
I'm more like looking to the bright side
than just like uh hunting for leaks or
anything I I just feel
so so happy when like you you show
something to the guy and then he applies
correctly or the guys like show them uh
like they have blogs on our Discord
group and we you see you see his their
routine you see their uh getting the
results so it I just see like for more
for the bright side of it you
know all that's a that's a very good I
mean expectation management uh is spot
on right there right yeah that's that's
very good to hear uh you also mentioned
briefly and when I scroll through
Instagram I came across a video I think
it was 2018 if I'm not mistaken are you
already mened the me mentioned Mr Nick
uh from uh from detox shout out to Mr
Nick Howard um can you tell us uh
apparently in the video that I saw it
seemed like he or his mythology had
quite a big impact on your
game you also mentioned MDA right which
which they work with a lot what kind of
impact did it have on your game oh a lot
man a lot uh uh especially on that
journey of 2016 that we were talking
about I think uh when I started when
things started to make more sense in my
head was like late 2016 when I started
to get in touch with his
methodology um I won a a curse on his
Instagram he like made some promotion
and I won uh it was pdmg poker detox
mental game I think that where at that
part of of my career was what I what I
needed because he cleaned like like a
lot of the thought process in that curse
and I won won the curse so I like I
remember um like watching that like in
one day I watched like everything and
helped me a lot and I remember in that
time he was building night vision also
and I I I already gave an interview for
him because he was like doing the night
vision and doing the curse and I was
like uh before he before he
going to sale like with the curse I
already I already had like all of the
things that he mentioned in the curse
just by like like observa printing uh
being kind of sneaky and doing the job
for myself so he like came with the
curse like oh I'm going to sell the
curse uh he had like some profiles of uh
hen note Etc and I already had like it
all like just before made everything
yourself yeah I I made it I made it
everything by myself and was like I
think my whole career in two high stakes
worked pretty well like with uh
simplifying strategies going through MDA
seeing where people leaking and
understanding why people are leaking I
think that's like the biggest thing that
uh Nick helped me um after on 500 Zoom
especially uh things starts to get
little bit tougher in my opinion so I
had to transition to a more GTO and more
balanced approach and that's where I
started to like in putting those those
stuff together but yeah he had a a very
good um impact on our on our career me
and in in solos also I think like the
way he thought about that was very very
very like out of out of line you know
like very out of the line in a good way
you
know and you mentioned that uh because
that was actually also also a question I
was thinking uh obviously in terms of
MDA for the people that don't know what
MDA is it stands for Mass database
analysis and basically uh it is you
analyze data of your population and
basically you look for leaks and if a
leak occurs you overe exploit in that
leak for example at a certain note
someone over folds so you over Bluff
that's kind of how it works you look for
these leaks in the pool labeled hot
spots cold spots and you attack
basically simply said obviously if you
play 10nl uh Hots spot paradise and then
as you move up uh the hot spots they
become less hot you know they're like
medium warm spots uh and also a lot of
them disappear or at least you have to
dig a little bit deeper right this is in
general if you look at poker five years
ago go you could exploit people on very
basic stats right if you had eight stats
you could exploit people now you need at
least 120 because the leaks are way
further down the tree they're more
disguised right um you mentioned that
when you then moved up to 500 Zoom this
probably occurred right there were less
leaks was it then also a good time that
you met saulo as he was I guess more
Theory oriented where you were more MDA
oriented so you guys made like you know
I'm imagining Dragon Ball Z to two of
these guys they together right and
become like a perfect version yeah yeah
no it was a little bit early um I was
very I I was like more
MDA in putting more MDA in the in the in
in my game but I already had that very
big very good theory uh background
because I think if you for you to
understand deeply MDA you got to have
like the theory very well based for sure
so I already had it Salo had more than
me for sure and then we started in
2017 and I think it could relate in in
in this sense I I think you're you're
accurate in this one um and then we
started to study together I te I was
like more advanced on MDA it was more
advanced in theory and yeah I I I tend
to agree with
that yeah yeah I I I I I had a similar
experience when I teamed up with uh it
was with explode 777 I don't know if you
ever played with him yeah yeah Morton
who Morton who left the team early I
remember the team was doing quite well
everyone was making good progress and
then Morton was the the fourth guy in
the team uh he went to travel the world
and we all said guy you're crazy we're
at the Breakthrough of our career but he
already talked about this Bitcoin and
ethereum thing a long long time ago so
who was the stupid guy then I guess it
was us as obviously afterwards he he had
skyrocketed to someone else but he was
like the bio guy explode was uh yeah I
mean explode is explode he's a spe
special guy he's probably listening uh
but he was definitely way more
exploitive I was also very exploitive
but I did understand I was just getting
it Theory and then when you put everyone
together and everyone has a certain
input suddenly great things can happen
I'm a big fan of teaming up with with
other players and especially players who
have a a different approach like this in
this case easily set an MDA guy mixed
with a p guy you will get very
interesting discussions and the truth
and poker is that you know p is not
always right MDA is not always right
it's always a little bit of a mix right
so if you can get expertise from both
areas I think that's kind of when the
magic happens so
after you started to implement MDA after
you started to meet Salo uh and start to
study with him how was playing poker
different after that compared to how it
was before that how did you experience
playing
poker how do you experience playing
poker you mean uh the feelings of just
playing in the in the in a feeling way
not in strategic way
right uh that's right that's usually
usually the feeling comes after the
Strategic right especially for example
let's say MDA what I think is good about
it it can offer you a certain amount of
certainty that when you're in doubt for
example to pull the trigger the
certainty in a certain hotspot in MDA
allows you to put a trigger right
there's no mental blockade as soon as
you for example people have no trouble
ethereum oriented people have no problem
pulling the trigger with the best
blockers right because their knowledge
about blockers is that big that if the
spot comes up they have the best
blockers uh they ship their stacking
it's the same with MDA if you're in a
spot and you know that the population
over over fulls 10% in general your
confidence is so high so you have no
mental blockades you just fire every
time it comes up nice nice so did you
experience something like that yeah for
sure how was it for you um okay so as I
said I buildt it up like late
2016 uh was at 25 andl uh early
2017 and I remember the feeling of
getting all the stuff's done and then
then looking at that and it was kind of
uh yeah it was a like Nick said like a
blueprint that what you got to do so I
looked at it and they started playing
like with that knowledge already like
the areas that I could exploit in both
ways like for example over bluffing over
folding over calling Etc and yeah the
feeling was that was a total different
game and that and I when we teach that
to to our students also they always
relate that also like oh it was like
that changed my mind uh opened my mind
for a lot of stuff so the the feeling
was very good because I already had that
that background of the the curse that
poker detox mental game that I did with
Nick uh that helped me a lot with the
thought process also so it was
very um how do I say very com very
comfortable you know to play like very
comfortable like I know what I'm doing
I'm 100% confident those stuff the stuff
started to happen a lot and even in my
interview with Nick he said that uh he
had the same lucky that run run better
in the in the beginning like start to
applying the stuffs and then started to
run run good so that's very good also
because if you start to run battle you
maybe like oh this [ __ ] doesn't doesn't
work let's change you lose conf the
confence
yeah yeah the confidence is key yeah
confidence is the key for sure and then
things started to happen and I was like
after that I was like uh experiencing a
very a way better experience of playing
poker because I was like uh trying to do
this hierarchy of theory stuffs and then
messing up and than like making a shitty
decision for sure and then when things
were more organiz in the hierarchy of my
thought process for example then I
started to to be like uh way to putting
way less mental energy stuffs that yeah
that matter matter basically in your hat
you're structured your decision-making
process and you prioritize what actually
mattered and thought to think about in
the hand and those were probably way
less things than
before yes way less things way more
accurate powerful um and then like went
for like my whole mid Stakes career like
that low stakes mid Stakes career like
that um and then gotta change gotta I
had to change again as I said especially
to play higher Stakes uh where the leaks
are way smaller in some areas they don't
exist anymore in some areas they are to
the other point so there's a lot of
things different and you got to be way
better on Theory you can't like just get
a for example hand that is 0% Bluff in
some spot and you just fire you're GNA
like be crush it in high stakes for sure
so I kind of I had to go back again in
more Theory wise and then adding some
other stuff more complex adding
complexity to my to my game to my
thought process so that's the the deal
right now but I think like and I can I
can relate in in some some people
talking like for MDA like oh MDA doesn't
work or oh you just like you you kind of
blindly attack some some [ __ ] and it it
will not work it will make you dumb it
will make you uh make big mistakes but
those people don't understand exactly
what MDA is like MDA can show you some
some areas of the game and you can you
have to deal with that like in a smart
way you you got to understand why people
are doing what they doing and why they
are like leaking in that way like why a
guy is over foring that in that line why
a guy is over bluffing that line like
what causes that what causes that is
just a behavior like a human behavior
natural human behavior that goes through
that area and work and and works like
that so if you're playing versus a very
super high stakes no matter who uh he
will probably like uh leak he'll
probably have some hard time to do some
type of plays you know so it's it it it
teaches you a lot you know the those
works with and you gota understand
pretty well Theory also you got to
understand you got to go to the PO grids
and see how range is and what part of
your range is hard to play in that way
what kind of your range is like uh your
range is full of some type of hands then
in that spot because of that like it's
natural for you to overbluff it's
natural for a guy to overbluff it's
natural for a guy to over fold you know
so I think you got to understand uh
deeply why uh those Stu
happen yeah in uh uh I'm a very big
advocate of why for example in uh in the
in the program that me and Adam created
in a technical section as well instead
of um I've seen a lot of data in in in
my life as well I've studied populations
and it's indeed like the main takeaways
I take from it are just bigger Concepts
like what leads to an over Bluff spot
what leads to an under Bluff spot why is
this an over plus bu and then basically
you can just predict based on the
variables I think in in our program we
list like eight variables which are
basically if all the variables go green
it's an over Bluff spot if all the
variable go red it's an under Bluff spot
and and obviously still you know
sometimes four are green and four are
red what do you do right then the SP
becomes very close obviously it's not
like this is now like oh now poker
became easy because EXA you know there's
still a lot of factors that have to be
taken into play you gotta dig deeper uh
you gotta dig like every day you gotta
review spots every day you gotta like
build the ristics everywhere so it's an
an infinite game for sure and you um
like we're going to be uh studying that
like all of the years and you not you'll
never get to the Perfection uh but you
can masterize that pretty well for
sure what do you think are uh if we're
talking about the topic of MDA what do
you think are some common MDA mistakes
you also talked about misconceptions
what do you think are so common
misconceptions and mistakes people make
when it comes out to
MDA um
what I think people do wrong in MDA is
that is that sure let's say let's say
for example you have someone who starts
to use MDA what is he going to do wrong
what are some common mistakes that
they're going to
make um I'm not sure if just using MDA
but what what I think people do wrong is
people think recreationals don't fold
enough and I think people have a common
like
misconception that uh Rags don't Bluff
enough also I think those are the
biggest
ones yeah and also I remember I get I
got I'm sure I mean you twitch as well
right from time to time yeah yeah and
then people ask like oh or they say oh
yeah this poo never Bluffs I mean it's
very black and white depends the line
depends the formation depends this the
same with with recreationals right yeah
Rec there spots where they're going to
mely over Bluff du to indeed you already
uh use the words natural unnatural right
yes if you look at Pio plays some P
plays you know sometimes Pio comes in a
spot with a lot of natural Bluffs he
realizes that and gives up half of them
for example where a human is like for
example I get I think I once gave an
example in a YouTube video uh on a
classic 359 Queen a
sport so starts low Runs Out high high
and all the gutters in the world are
available and miss and I think it was a
bottom versus big blind scenario yeah on
that scenario people will have to give
up hands on the river whereas nobody's
gonna give up [ __ ] eight High when
it's a queen Ace run out right why would
you give up ASI you're never gonna win
so exactly it leads to it you know it's
an example of a spot that's gonna lead
towards over bluffing so we can do
underfolding and then there's other
boards which are way less natural right
like flush completing three Broadways
hitting whatever where you suddenly have
to see a lot of uh I don't know low
pairs complete airballs yeah and then
suddenly it's like not very human right
the human thing you do because we like
to have Equity we like to Bluff a scare
card we like to Bluff a range improving
card for example and basically you have
to start yeah indeed like what you said
you have to understand how humans
construct their ranges basically right
exactly but for that you first need you
need the understanding of theory right
because if you don't understand Theory
you don't understand what is supposed to
be in there because if you see Theory
and you're like oh this is not very
human you can basically you don't even
have to look anymore at the pool data
you know it's most likely exactly under
blood spot for example exactly exactly
that that I relate a lot with that and
there are some spots that I don't you
don't even have data you can have like
be one bilon hand that will you not have
like a river forbat spot
like with some texture or whatever
you're not going to have the data so you
got to predict got to understand and by
just uh studying a lot of patterns you
can understand uh why things are
happening and one thing that I think is
very important also is that there's a
lot of guys that are very good and like
naturally observative and understanding
what what's happening but even though
even these guys like if you don't see
data like ever uh there's a lot of
stuffs that you can assume like wrongly
and I I related that like I had an idea
before seeing Data before seeing deep
data that like oh this stuff's never
happens or this stuff don't happen and
then you can surprise yourself a lot so
uh I I think open your mind by looking
at the data pretty uh pretty deep uh you
can you can surprise yourself in some
spots
also yeah obviously you know our mind is
very sensitive to biases exactly and I
think what I like about data is
basically if there's an argument going
off oh I think this I think that well
okay let's start think let's stop
thinking let's just run the spot and
we'll see right what does the data say
the the data in the end is gonna be
correct right so I think it's a good
place to test your assumptions for
example right for sure um you also
mentioned
that H when you move up the stakes leaks
are less apparent also for example
throughout the years uh let's say five
years ago I think the average player
that I played again against was more
passive and more foldy now the average
player that I play against is way more
aggressive and less willing to fold
right it's a general change I would say
also if I compare for example data that
I have run um for example when I make
new products now I look at my old
lessons from CF and I compare some stats
and I see the population over the years
slowly moving towards a more GTO
frequency you know we had that in the
past pre- flop now you see that on the
Flop the gaps are being closed but like
I said it doesn't mean that the leaks
are no longer there you have to dig a
little bit deeper um but when you
mentioned that when you were moving up
certain leaks or certain common
population leaks would disappear and
other ones would even go the opposite
way around could you maybe give an a
practical example of that something that
you think works for example very well at
low stakes and not so well anymore at
higher
Stakes oh sure uh have a very easy one
that is uh over folding to see bat
especially early positions versus big
blind like utg versus big blind if
you're going to play like 25 NL the
average rag will overfall to a small cat
and a high stakes rag will definitely
the basic basic
one yeah yeah that's because you have to
you have to be quite ditty there I my uh
when epmp gets involved my win rates
usually suffer a little bit uh which is
which is which is really interesting
because indeed you already need to make
from the big blind vers epmp you can
make quite some nitty faults imagine
full ring man I mean I assume you never
studied F ring but imagine you go play
live and only entities yeah only
on uh yeah it's it's an interesting spot
yeah great great example great great
example this podcast is brought to you
by poker ambition where me and Adam have
created our coaching program the
mechanics of poker after having reached
High 6 poker ourselves we tested out
this philosophy on our CFB students
which saw them rise through the ranks
and double their win rate we then took
the best knowledge of that cfp program
and turn it into the mechanics of Poker
so you can have that high quality
content without the long-term commitment
and often Hefty price that comes with a
CFB program now I will be teaching you
the technical side of how poker really
works how to think about the game and
how to consistently get better and Adam
focuses on the mindset and performance
skills you need to know in order to
convert all that technical poker
knowledge into more consistent profits
at the table now this program is high
level it's made for professional poker
players who have the ambition to break
free from mid-stakes and move up to high
stakes poker so if you're ambitious
about your poker goals go over to poker
ambition.com for more information and
there you can also find a free one-hour
demo of everything that is inside the
program if you have any further
questions don't hesitate to reach out
but without further Ado let's let's get
back to more goodness in this episode
Adam do you have any uh do you want to
jump in here anything you would like to
add or ask yeah I've got a bunch of
questions uh first of all I thought it
was very interesting what you talked
about about human nature and people
making mistakes and when you've got
those kind of red flags or those kind of
hot spots appear in I like how you are
relating that to like the psychology of
the person and I thought was a very
interesting thing to try and get into
the head of how thinking in this spot I
think that's a lot deeper than most we
will go they're looking at the stats the
data how to exploit they're not thinking
there's a human being on the end of the
screen who's playing this way for a
certain reason so yeah think that shows
the kind of level of depth you go to
another thing that I picked up on was a
few times in your career you've had to
kind of go back almost like stop stuff
and go back to the basics of the
fundamentals it happened like I think
2016 time and I think that's really hard
to do like you you you've SE me do it
quite effortlessly but to stop what
you're doing that was working and have
to go back to basics or create new
strategy new approach I think it's
really challenging so I think you said
you did it again high stakes where so
you were doing more the MDA approach and
then you had to come with your own
strategies and get deeper into theory
for you how challenging is that to kind
of stop the kind of current approach and
go back ands like going deeper how does
that work for you and how do you uh yeah
sounds like a few times in your career
you've had to do that and how does that
kind of transition kind of play out for
you I would say
that I kind of like not kind of like I
would say that I like to do that a lot
you know I think one of my
biggest
uh my biggest skills to be like that is
to be able to structure stuffs and to
restructure stuffs so I'm kind of
addicted to it if if I'm going to think
deeper on that uh right now I think my
biggest leak would be uh to to just inut
into practice or to not that I have not
that I'm not able to inut that in
practice I think I I apply it well but I
like more the basement works so when
something uh goes wrong I really enjoy
to restructure and to really think about
the stuffs you know so when I did the
agendas uh work there I I remember I was
like I did a surgery on my knee like in
late 2015 to 2016 and I remember I was
like uh I couldn't walk and I was only
on my bed and I was working like 10
hours a day like just restructuring
stuffs and doing Excel shets and like I
always like to build those stuffs you
know like building eristics like I'm
going to study Tre B pots big blind
versus utg uh what are like the the
risks like how low boards play how
twoone plays how monotone plays uh what
are you know working on the basement I I
think my I I like that a lot you know I
I like that a lot so it it it it's not
that of a challenge you know
it's I feel pleasure on doing that I
feel you know I like to do that awesome
yeah it sounds like you enjoy going very
deep and almost like breaking something
to rebuild it with a better structure
I'm picturing you like as a kid having a
Lego castle and knocking it down so you
could restructure the foundations to
build a bigger castle and yeah I think
it's a obviously a personality trait of
yours where you enjoy that type of work
I find a lot of people might struggle
with that because obviously if you've
had success in an area and what you did
was working it's quite hard to kind of
jump ship and try and create a new
strategy that's better than what you
were doing I think some people get stuck
at that point because that rebuilding
process theyve got L their identity
wrapped up in that kind of the results
they've gotten they've got in so for you
to enjoy that kind of deep restructuring
um so for you when you do that kind of
work let's say for example let's say
you're go to high stakes and you realize
that you need to switch up your strategy
and go deeper and restructure things do
you get joy from the pursuit of trying
to figure things out or when you've got
like this new structured strategy and
approaches is it the end result that
gives you the satisfaction so is it more
the enjoyment of doing or the end point
you're trying to get to that that gives
you that kind of joy
that's a very great good question man
congratulations on that
uh I think the
pursuit yeah exactly yeah I can relate
another stuff that is I always like to
kind
of my whole career I
didn't I didn't like in put that much of
a volume because I was always like
building stuff going to practice okay
that works nice like okay that works I'm
done with the I I don't have like
this I'm I'm not happy anymore just to
like printing there you know like okay
let's go go to a new challenge let's
build another stuff you know that's why
I like to move up like that's why I um
for example at 200 200 and all I think
it was the time that I just like printed
more like oh I'm here winning money
let's win money but basically like okay
let's go to to 500 Zoom new challenge
okay things are not working let's
rebuild okay it works like I'm not going
to stay in 500 zom La okay it works
let's just print here um okay let's go
to 1K let's go to see what's going on
here okay that doesn't work let's
rebuild some part of my game where I'm
leaking okay I'm beating 1K let's go to
2K like I'm always uh hunting for for a
new challenge in in this sense and I
feel uh and and there's a lot of new
challenges uh strategic it's
strategically
speaking um changing sites playing on
other sites I started to play heads up
right uh in the last year also so I'm
always looking for like new
challenges and to solve like solve a
puzzle go to another puzzle go to
another puzzle basically that
not just exploiting uh
the The Hot Spot always in motion trying
to find the next challenge to solve the
next problem the next thing to rebuild a
structure and model towards so yeah that
explains quite well your kind of
childhood or your kind of background you
you bounced around a lot from tennis to
football to Counter Strike to music
again solving problems to you get to a
point where you're like what's the next
problem what's the next challenge it
takes me back to that time you said you
were managing the kind of music scene
in in Brazil and then you're like I'm
bit bored of this it's almost like
you've solved that problem it's like
your mind's like give me another riddle
give me a Rubik's Cube I need something
to solve see it sounds like you're
you're constantly which is great for
growth obviously I'm guessing we can
tell by this conversation you've grown
in so many areas I'm sure that's a a big
kind of facet is that kind of ability to
take on challenges try and find ways to
solve them so other than your problem
solving abilities and your competitive
background are there any other character
traits that you feel like you've had
from from childhood or you've had you've
developed early that have allowed you to
have success in poker in business is
there any character trades that come to
mind or any that you've developed over
the last few years on your
journey
um okay there are some for
sure uh
there let me
think I think curiosity of um knowing
knowing the stuffs is very important I
think one that I that I learned it um
somewhat old and like in the in the like
almost finishing the
uni um I think about
discipline I I kind of I was always like
as as we we talked like in sports and
you learn all of those stuffs but I
think I uh I kind of leaked in that on
on some part of my my life you know know
like after the school uh in the band uh
we didn't have like in music to learn
the music and Etc you you need
discipline and you need like work and
training for sure but
the environment can be like a little bit
can get you a little bit lazy and can
get you like a little bit more addicted
to fun and party and all of those stuff
that make you undisciplined so I had to
relearn that and I relearned it in in
the the worst way that was in uni like
when you do like a work work to to get
it done we call here in Brazil it's like
TCC that is like the work that you do to
to finish the the this the the uni that
I went to business and I was almost um
the client of of it and that like was a
very had a very big impact in me because
I was like ah de with that and things
was were working and that I faced like
almost a punch in my face like you got
to be the client of that going to make
like another six months I was like what
the [ __ ] happened you know like I was so
[ __ ] lazy that I let this to to came
to to this part and it was like a work
that we had a year to do and I got there
and uh it was a group uh had me and and
three guys more and
then my Park was fine but it was like
very average and there like there was
two parts that was like totally [ __ ]
and it was almost Decline and H we
worked almost to get Decline and then I
was
like to the teachers like please guys
don't do that etc etc and then I had to
redo that like in two weeks and I I did
it almost by myself so I I I learned a
lot in this in this episode also that
was like I have the power to do like a
[ __ ] good work and if I stop and do
my work and if I have discipline to work
and to like stop the the distractions
and do the work like I have a very good
uh like brain or anything like I have a
very good capacity of doing the stuffs
you know so that was a very very good
episode that teached me discipline and
teached me about uh
that if you don't do the things if you
doesn't doesn't matter like if you're
smart doesn't matter uh if you're like
doesn't matter how good you are if you
stop working you're gonna you're gon to
get [ __ ] you know I can relate with no
athletes if you see for example uh I
don't know if you guys like football but
for example ronal Ronaldinho you know
like he's a guy that like the biggest
talent ever and like at 26 he was
basically like retired because he didn't
train anymore Etc so for you to stay on
the top you got to like work every
[ __ ] day you gotta you gotta keep the
work you gotta keep the work if not
you're gonna you're gonna like the guys
will will just pass for
you yeah awesome see I got the Curiosity
to begin with I think we've covered that
a few times you're uh you like to learn
and solve problems and then that
discipline it sounds like you said like
in the kind of music environment it was
quite challenging to uh develop that
discipline to do the kind of boring
long-term just like kind of showing up
and putting the work in because
obviously through that environment
sounds like there was a lots of fun
stuff and easy to get distracted and
carried away but yeah it sounds like for
your studies you redeveloped that kind
of just the the hierarchy of how how
important it is not just to be talented
not just to have a good brain but to
actually apply that and I think as a
poker player it's very mean Rene always
like look back at these conversations
and takes a long time to get to the top
it takes like five six seven eight years
that's a long Pursuit and it's there's
going to be a lot of boring days in a
computer trying to solve a problem that
is challenging and you've got to find a
way to show up with enthusiasm with
curiosity day after day with with that
kind of mindset and it's a skill that
you've got to learn and I think often
poker players a lot of us we come out of
a kind of school structure and then we
start kind of figuring out life for
ourselves and we haven't really got that
discipline like self discipline where
you show up because you want to show up
we used to like kind of the consequences
and repercussions of not you have to
learn that skill I think some people
have it I know myself I didn't I think R
much if you haded going into your PO
career we have to learn it on that Pock
Pur suit to be disciplined towards an
objective even when it's not fun even
when it's not glamorous and even when it
might take a year two years to get
anything out of it so I think that's a
really good character trait that you've
developed on your journey or just before
you started right got a few more
questions on kind just looking back I
always like to reflect on the journey
you've went through and some lessons
you've maybe learned and could to still
for for the audience so one question I
want to ask is if we could go back to
your 24 year old self let say it's the
the the version of you who was ready to
go pro and this was the one who was kind
of ready to have success but also had a
lot of things to figure out is there any
advice you would give to yourself like
nor what you know now if you could go
back in time to your 24 year old self is
there any piece of advice one or two
things of advice you would give to
yourself in that moment that would help
you to maybe fast track your progression
to the top who there's a lot of of
advices that I could I could give to
my to my youngest version um for sure I
would say that it worked I would say
like it it worked and say that uh it
worth it also like I would I would say
like keep the work that it will worth
keep the passion if there's a way to to
do it uh to keep the passion for the
game and for the
work um and there's an another like
small advices about strategy all those
stuffs but I think that the question
were more related to to mindset
perspective but I would say um that
keeping the hard work and
discipline
um keeping the the ex extion
um yeah I think it's that maybe
something towards uh Rel
relationship um relationship
with with the guys on the team and
managing people I would say that uh
managing
people I would say for my young 24 years
old fella I would say
you
can you can have fun in working with
other
people I would say that is a good advice
because I was kind of uh skeptical with
that like I was kind
of yeah hopeless that uh working with
some other people and depending on some
other people and other stuffs could be
good in some manner um so yeah I would
say work with other guys is can be fun
like go go on it also because I I
don't I
don't I don't regret I don't regret I
don't regret of
trusting uh I I don't regret on getting
back to work with people and to work and
to build a company for sure love that
yes I think that's great advice and when
you look back on yourself often like
your younger version is very naive to
what it's going to take to get the top
but this kind of baller potential that's
kind of capable of a lot and some when
we go back to ourselves we're like
you're on the right path work hard put
your head down execute on what you think
your inkin are right by that I mean
you're on the path that's in line with
your values you're GNA have a great time
the end results going to be worth it
then also there's certain things that
you just don't value at that time like
you said I remember you being quite
skeptical of doing the CRP stuff and not
really thinking like you wanted to share
stuff and being very maybe ego driven
but also quite wanted to keep stuff to
yourself but then as you've come through
your journey and now you're in a kind of
management role that's a great lesson
that you're like look life's better with
other people you can build a big
business there actually so much value in
kind of working with others and on that
path so yeah I think that's a a great
lesson and sometimes you just got to
live the experience before you could
actually distill that yeah I always
think it's nice to uh look back at you
younger self and think that's the one
thing that was missing that the that's
the thing that was right that I'd
amplify that was the one thing that was
missing and yeah good good thing to look
back on all right one final question
from me U so I want to know how your
definition of success has changed as
you've evolved as a person and so if we
look at you like let's say the 24 year
old self think a good starting point it
sounds like your expectations were quite
high in terms of you wanted to be
successful on the flip side your kind of
main goals and definitions of success
were probably make enough money to
support yourself kind of the goals we we
set ourselves and we're kind of unsure
of where it's going to go what's your
kind of current definition of success
and how's that changed as you've kind of
achieved a lot of the Milestones that
you set out to do what's your kind of
definition success right
now great question my def my definition
of success is very simple
is let me let me phrase that very
correctly I would say be happy only but
I would say
like be
the the happiest that you can that yeah
the happiest that you that you can hm
not the happiest that can I I would I
would keep the be happy I think sucess
is just be happy because it doesn't
matter what you have doesn't matter what
you achieve if you're H if you're very
happy then you just have everything you
know because that's that's my my end
goal always like to be to to be happy
because I I already had problems with
that also uh like anxiety depression and
I think only not only but if you face
that once in your life and you feel that
that if you know that feeling of not
truly being happy like to be sad like
truly sad then you can you can
understand that just the end of it is if
you feel well if you be happy you're
just very
successful wow love that yeah it's so
powerful as well when you stop and think
about it it's right it's like it's like
almost like a correct equation it's like
if you're successful and unhappy is that
really a good outcome so yeah I think
happiness has always got to kind of be
that overarching kind of end points I
feel like we often play a game on like
kind of two graphs where one's like the
success graph where we acquire stuff we
get money success achievements and then
we think happiness is this separate
graph that I'll have success first and
then I'll start doing the happiness
stuff I'll start looking at my health
after and almost like take the success
and then happiness where in my opinion
like they're on the same graph there's
like the correlation and I think often
focus on happiness first weth trying to
be successful often leads to the more
successful people but it definitely
leads to uh the more fulfilling life so
yeah things are really nice um I I
haven't heard it that simple and that's
the kind of one wanted words but I think
it's a beautiful way to to kind of come
up with a success equation and for you
when it when it comes to being happy
because you said you had that moment
where perhaps you went through a bit of
a depressive episode and you kind of
looked at kind of the deeper Part of
Yourself what is it that does make you
happy so we got that kind of simple
equation of be happy is there anything
that kind of correlates strongly with
that in terms of the way you show up in
Life or the things you do that make you
happy you got a kind of good indication
of that for yourself right
now um I think it's not only like one or
two things or um I think it's just a
state you know like be happy is to be
full realized with with you with your
life or just feeling well um right now
what makes me happy is being talk
talking with you guys is making me happy
you know like uh when Renee talked to me
I felt like I felt
very uh how do I say very well reward
like for my career for my my work
because I remember when I started to
play uh I talking with v he said like
man there's a guy that coached me like
uh a guy from from Netherland like he's
awesome he's high f player etc etc and
now I'm here with with with dako you
know like guy that were already a high
six player when I started a guy that was
an inspiration for me so those stuffs
like the that uh that
that that changing uh that changing not
that um that exchange of of I don't know
being grateful for the stuffs or being
uh you know like all of the all of those
feelings uh in some manner it depends on
where you are it depends of what type of
stuffs you're expecting or what type of
stuffs you are facing you can you can
search not searching for happiness but
just being like find yourself or being
yourself uh I think it going to make you
happy if you're like when I play I play
at very low volume because I have a lot
of stuff but when I play I just play
like feeling very happy like I played
heads up a lot versus the big boys like
versus Bon clicker and the guys asked me
like what the [ __ ] are you doing like
playing 2K heads up versus Bon clier
like man I'm just like enjoying a lot to
play you know I'm just enjoying a lot
when I when I battled the guys 5K like
Davey Jones Gale uh even make boy F like
I just enjoy a lot to play with the guys
so I'm having fun you know of course I
can't lose that much money but I'm
having fun you know so I think it's all
about that yeah it's the simple stuff
right it's the yeah the be the being in
the moment and enjoying the life you're
living being grateful for how far you've
come and the kind of experiences that
you're living so yeah I love that it's
sometimes doesn't have to be this kind
of one encompassing path that we're on
it can just be the the small moments
that we're enjoying so yeah really
really good stuff there yeah of course
like the journey um what was said about
like the end the the end goal of people
just uh put so many obstacles for their
happiness like oh when I build this when
I I don't know when I buy an apartment I
will be happy when I get my promotion I
will be happy but we got to talk about
that you know like it's the journey you
gotta uh there's a lot of stuff that you
that you do that you don't like of
course everyone's got to do that like
you got to be disciplined sometimes you
got to face uh very bad
uh very bad days but is for is the
journey like is the the mix of feelings
that you're going to face that are going
to make you uh guy that faced like a
bigger obstacle is going to make you
like uh a smarter guy is gonna you like
like build build yourself build your
happiness I think that's a very powerful
lesson and yeah it reminds me of one of
my favorite mentors is Michael Singer
who's got the book The untethered soul
and one of his Concepts is why can't you
be happy now like what what stops what
blocks happiness and very often it's
like you said it's we think we need to
do XY Zs we think we need to achieve the
next Milestone get the next goal get to
the next place and then magically we'll
we'll open up the happy box and things
will be good yeah yeah yeah when in
reality like happiness is it's now
happiness is this moment it's what we
can learn from our current experience
this challenge that's right in front of
you that feels like it shouldn't be here
this is where you can find the happiness
in the pursuit of whatever you're doing
so yeah I think it's a yeah it's a
really really powerful concept so yeah
glad you glad you shared that nice man
nice all right Renee have you got any
questions or any questions you want to
take away with the conversation I had so
many urges to open my mouth but I
listened I listened quietly but I mean
there was so much goodness in here uh
about the happiness I think a very uh
important thing is for people to
understand for example first of all
people should not miss understand
happiness with
constantly uh looking for pleasure right
we're talking about long-term happiness
and fulfillment we're not talking I feel
like eating ice cream every day you know
something that might give them pleasure
but come on if you do that every day in
the end you won't be happy right we're
talking longterm uh fulfillment and
happiness also I think a very important
point is that happiness in my opinion is
a skill it's it's it's something indeed
if you if you look for something to be
happy right now you can find it but
unfortunately due to the way Society is
we get this idea that indeed what you
also mentioned that you know you need to
achieve certain things in order to be
happy or external things will make you
happy but in my opinion it's a habit
also if you don't celebrate the small
things then when you finally have the
big thing what you meant you finally can
buy this house then if you didn't train
yourself how to feel good about
something about small wins about
day-to-day stuff then you cannot
suddenly expect yourself to know how to
how to experience that happiness when
that big thing comes along and I think a
lot of people and I I mean I I can talk
about this right now because I've
experienced it myself where I always f
for example in my PO career in the
beginning I struggled a lot was in big
depth and I was just so fixated on okay
I need to become the best and then I get
money and then I will feel so good yeah
obviously uh surprise surprise it felt a
a little bit less fulfilling than I
thought because I put it so much so much
weight on that end go right you you
think wow I'm going to feel amazing but
I never really trained myself to feel
good on a day-to-day basis so then when
you're finally there you will not feel
as for filled and I have to say
Brazilians are very good at being happy
in my opinion from my experience hanging
out with Brazilians they they just you
know they if you live in Brazil you know
you also have quite a lot to complain
about in general uh you know there's
some things out of your control politics
Etc I know you're a big fan of Politics
as well but still Brazilians Brazilians
doesn't matter how bad their their life
uh some people's life is they still
always look find something to be happy
about or look forward about in my
opinion that's really something I admire
about Brazilians compared to for example
Northern Europeans in my in my opinion
Brazilians are better at being happy
nice man you you talk a lot about a lot
of important stuff like f field uh
that's a term that I don't think we have
a trans a a a very good translation
Portuguese but it's a term that you you
talk all of the stuff that you that you
talked about very are very smart and I
yeah you can you have to understand like
deeply the
the uh the meaning of of Happiness like
it's not like eating ice cream every day
or I don't know drinking every day and
barting every day of course you're going
to get [ __ ] and you got to think like
about um of course things that fulfill
you in in in in a lot of manners like to
achieve something good of course you got
to you got to have like the goal to
achieve something good to be better in
something uh those are the stuff that
will have that that will give you like
the the true happiness you know like not
uh only like small Pleasures that are
going to like give you a pleasure right
now and then and then are done you know
like fulfill you it's it's very
important and I I really I really like
it what what you said
yeah and I mean we we saw that this
coming back in this conversation as well
right where you said enjoy the process
in my opinion as well if you are really
frustrated about where you are now you
have a very negative perspective on
everything that's going to happen so you
will see things and you will kind of be
in a negative State and then usually
good things don't really happen it's
also what you what what you mentioned
when you transitioned Into Cash games
and kind of let go of that I guess when
you play mtts you hoping for that [ __ ]
always right you hope oh I want to make
that Big B
with you don't have that so you're just
I'm just going to enjoy this process and
when you feel happy about the process
and you let go of the expectations it
actually starts to happen right so if
you're happy right now uh and you know
you can look at this from a more
spiritual side if you if you're just
happy at this moment if you're grateful
for everything you have you will see if
you don't need anything more then
suddenly more things will actually come
on your path then if you're trying to
get desperately one these other things
then you're actually pushing them way
sort of powerful powerful
nice
so yeah I mean there's nothing we could
talk about after this this is gonna blow
this conversation away in my opinion but
you know we can still try we we're we're
we're now in in Cur current day moment
uh was kind of wanted to ask some
questions about in terms of looking
forward where you are going um I mean
you already talked about um your
philosophy towards the game right and
and what drives you your passion your
curiosity um I wanted to to ask you
something that I saw on I think it was
on the bprc site you guys say we are the
best cash game team in the world now
obviously I'm very curious what do you
think makes you guys the best and how
did
your mythology evolve from for example
when you first started out uh together
with Sao I guess working from the
mythology on Nick Howard how did that
then further evolve into what you guys
are doing now nice um
so first question uh why why are we the
best
um and I think
uh one one of the things that I think
it's very important is structure
so methodology and structure are the
things that we work at the most um to
give our guys like the best tools the
best process the B the best uh ways of
getting better because at the end of the
day as we know as we are poker players
you as a coach you can you can give a
lot you can teach a lot you can do
whatever you want you can work their
mindset with um like psychologist or
whatever but at the end of the day what
makes a guy
uh very good is the the effort that he
will put uh in in his hours so what we
what we do is to try to to give them the
best way of teaching the best way of
studying teaching and and giving them
the best structure like man you're going
to study like that you're going to do
that you're going to do that and then
those guys can work uh pretty well for
from them from themselves and about the
methodology uh we are rebuilding that in
this in this year so probably a lot of
new stuffs will come uh we didn't we
didn't finish yet but nowadays what we
have is uh simplified Strate stres from
the guys that starts especially on like
now that we have Micro Stakes team so we
have guys like from 5nl to 2kl for
example from the micro team micro Stakes
team to to the main team and what what
happens with them like in their career
is to to have a very good uh basement uh
Theory basement in in the beginning like
to understand uh like the basements of
the game like uh uh where DV comes from
pod ODS uh um in difference all of the
those important Concepts to build all of
that but at the same time to give them
what we call our our blueprints that are
simplification so the guys that comes
from from the lower Stakes will be
playing like very simplified applying
things earning confidence earning money
and then when they rise they can add
more complexity and then you can you can
you can basically find find better the
anomalies you can um be more accurate
basically be more accurate so you kind
of get
like the things done in a with a certain
percent of accuracy low accuracy let's
say like that but earning
confidence
um understanding the game and then you
you start to add compl complexity
basically doing what we did in our
careers and pass uh giving giving to the
guys of the team yeah but about the best
the best cash game team that's uh of
course uh as H and there's another thing
that I think it's important because we
are basically competitors you guys are
for what I know you guys are closed in
your cfp for for the moment but you guys
have a cfp also and you guys have curse
and I think that's very important and I
was
even basically in all Industries um
people who sees like in not in in don't
are guys that are that are not in the
industry can say like oh competitor is
always like the the this term can be
like pejorative or can be like something
like oh my competitor is something
someone that is uh I don't know not bad
but someone that I want to to to to to
fight with or or anything and I think
that's very different because when you
have an industry that you have good
competitors like guys doing good work um
I think that's better for everyone you
know so having you guys having for
example beb I know I saw that the guys
are crushing there uh detox for itself
and here in Brazil we have a lot of
teams but it basically M teams but when
you build like a better when when you
have good competitors when you have guys
doing the same work that you do but do
like doing super good work then this
will just like build a bigger industry
like I I rather have like 10% of a super
huge industry than having like 50% of a
very small industry you know so I I
really enjoy and I'm I'm really grateful
for you guys for you guys to to invite
me and I'm pretty sure you guys um guys
think in in a at least in in a in a um
in the not in the same way but in in a
in how do I say in
a I very similar way simar yeah similar
way yeah no yeah for sure and I think
that's that's very nice and it builds a
very good a very good
industry yeah and I I think this has
also been a trend in your PO career as
well you like it when yeah when when
there's a competitive market or table
because it also gets the best out of you
right it raises the necessity for you to
perform and for you guys to deliver and
I think I think that challenge and what
like what that does with yourself in
your development is something that you
really enjoy and I can strongly relate
to that nice nice for sure in terms of
uh
um if you talk about exploitative place
um
sometimes I speak to someone that might
say let's say for example someone has a
leak and then basically I say okay well
that guy is a leak or the population has
a leak so attack right as simple as
simple as that but then they say yeah
but if I attack then all it makes it so
obvious because if I Bluff this I Bluff
everything and then he sees my bluff and
then he will
readjust uh and then basically what
happens to make story short he doesn't
do anything because he's afraid of the
possible future consequences okay I'm
sure you've dealt with some students who
you had to kind of convince if you
wanted to make him over aggressive in a
Hotpot for example how do you deal with
these kind of students and what do you
I'm sure there's people listening that
like hey that's me what do you have to
say for sure to these people so like
some like some coaching right now nice
nice very good very cool and important
question because as you said said
there's a lot of guys that can relate
with that um first of all uh you
can't you first of all you got to think
that your opponent or yeah your opponent
like the villain he doesn't think like
you that's the first thing like his mind
is his mind you can't assume what he's
thinking of course if you're playing
versus lonus and you're bluffing the
worst combo ever in the in the line he
will he will understand that of course
but uh there are some areas that of the
game that are so complex and that
basically uh I'm not going to say that
no one no one's understand but they're
so complex and there's so many variables
uh fighting each other that if you don't
don't [ __ ] like up in like the worst
manner possible uh it will be very hard
for for someone to spot so first of all
the guy have to SP second he have to
know how to adjust and third of it he
have to have the the guts to adjust so
it's like a long a long period I would
say um at least for for high Stak
especially right now you can't do like
very big uh very big exploits um because
yeah people will will perceive and we
will understand but if we're playing
like lower Stakes uh especially versus
for example recreational
they can they can they can see what
you're doing and they can think in a in
a way that you you would never think you
know because their minds their minds
Works differently so maybe you can think
oh this guy we understand that I don't
have natural Bluffs and the guy is not
even thinking about that so I wouldn't I
wouldn't uh I wouldn't pay attention to
those stuffs and I always I always
give what I what I do when I face a
student that is more like skeptical on
those stuff I just show them the results
of the guys that came uh the guys that
did what what he's not willing to that
he doesn't want to do and show that it
works and it's not like that that that's
going to happen like no one will like
every single spot will fight against you
etc etc adjust super
adjust that would be my Approach right
do you think this power oia comes
from I think this par paranoia comes
from um for the simple concept of
GTO that GTO Works to be un exploitable
so people thinks that naturally EVS from
the games comes from being an exploit
unexploitable so I think that's like
this yeah this this paranoia comes from
this bigger bigger statement that people
thinks that in like normal games uh will
come from you to be
unexploitable uh uh instead of like just
playing like instead of people just make
mistakes and you play like something
that is a little bit closer to to your
ring to to a to a good game and then the
EV comes from there you know or explain
itself that I think actually that makes
a lot of sense yeah I think that's
important important especially I usually
highlight that point what you said what
is the correct counter exploit let's say
you're over bluffing in a spot yeah okay
what is the correct counter exploit 0%
folding yeah sorry but I don't see that
happening right people even even even if
I play you also have to be honest with
yourself right even when I play and I
know someone is over bluffing I'm not
foing zero% exactly like 0% is hard to
do to be on top of your game and you're
really going to f z% like 10 times in a
row as well you need to be quite
confident right like obviously you know
someone can adjust maybe once and make a
light call for example a frequency call
he made a pure call okay great for you
and then afterwards he might think okay
well our hero called him last time so
this time I'm sure he's not gonna Bluff
again and basically he already kind of
adjust in his head and in the end in the
end also I think like people just revert
back to what they do I always say a
folder is going to fold and a station is
going to station that's just how it
works exactly right exactly exactly and
I and I and I can relate a lot on that I
I I always catch myself like uh having
having to think like don't don't try to
go like against what is like normal to
like the normal behavior of or some
player or some pool like if you're going
to oh no but he's like that but in this
part because of X he will do like the
opposite like that's very hard to happen
and another stuff that I think um in
this in the subject that worth talking
about is if you pick like mid Stakes rag
that is good at Theory let's see like
mid 200 NL rag that 200 NL is is where
people already plays like super super
well in my opinion uh if you get a guy
that like works a lot on people
uh watch your Twitches Etc and a guy
that that understands poker if you if
you if you tell him like the ranges are
this one this one spot is this one he
will probably like take a very good
decision like he will understand what he
got to do if he if he knows how the
ranges are and if he knows what what
type of spot is he'll probably like be
very accurate his decisions but what I
think people don't understand is and
where the the leak comes from is people
don't know how the ranges are you know
people normally think like oh uh I'm
gonna overall him like there because I
overall this combo that is a pure fold
he can understand that but he also don't
understand that that the actions that
he's taking is leading him with a
different range that he's he's actually
have you know so I think the biggest
leak from from everyone is understanding
how the ranges actually are because
they're not how you think you it it is
you know so you can be thinking that
you're over calling and you can be over
folding and the opposite also it's like
uh it's like a spot
where let's say for example you say on
the river like oh I will only call here
with a spade combo a spade combo is
better to call with but on the turn a
spade combo was better to fold with so
basically the hands that you say that
you're were going to go it on the river
you already folded on the turn so that
at some point you know you have no more
calls left right and then especially
like and this is where the
rationalization comes in right of what
we already wanted to do the station will
find a a reason why he can still make an
excuse to station because that's what he
wants to do and the hero fer will find a
reason why this is a hero fault you know
yeah so in your decision- making proc
say you know it's like what does Z think
minus a couple of combos because he's a
station so you have to know yourself and
take that in consideration right yeah
don't Bluff it's good
stuff all right noted noted uh going
going forward in in your uh in your
poker career
um you said that you were going to play
more you were battling out at the at the
higher Stakes tables with with some of
the best guys what what do you think is
something in order to really Crush those
games you would still need to improve
upon whoa
that's that's a secret man I can't tell
I'm
kidding um find the full butter more
often that was
one um but to be fair once you reach
higher Stakes people get more aggressive
so it works in your favor anyway yeah
yeah yeah for sure um I think um in
order to to to get a good win rate
overall uh it's just a matter of
fighting good games uh in matter of rag
battling and playing vers to guys with
uh I think deeply understanding deeply
Theory I would
say um more than even deeper even deeper
yeah I would say even deeper yeah I
would say I would say that is is the key
um I wouldn't yeah I wouldn't say too
much of
exploits versus the guys that are
already like very very very good so yeah
I would say understanding and theory is
so so so so deep and so like it's a very
big puzzle that I think that and for
sure um being able to to apply stuffs
pretty well so kind of relates to to
mindset uh actually totally relates to
mindset and
yeah being able to to apply things
pretty
well um yeah being able to apply stuffs
and understanding deeper Theory
so yeah that I would say how do you deal
with um the fact that you you have only
so many hours a week that you can play
in terms of for example what I noticed
myself if the gap between how much hours
I've studied for for example the cfp or
for courses that I'm making compared to
how much hour I actually apply that when
that Gap when there's an imbalance I can
have
trouble uh playing because I have a lot
of theoretical knowledge in my head but
I don't have the hours of experience to
really feel it you know so that that
comes
intuitive how do you how do you deal
with
that I relate with that for sure um you
kind of feel Rusty you know like when
you when you go when you go play for
Rusty and then um so uh the way I want
you know you maybe lack a little bit of
momentum you know yeah yeah the way I
want to to deal with that but but I
think the opposite is good also because
I can see some guys that are just like
playing and playing and playing a lot
and when you don't like and you don't
like get a little bit off of what like
if you if you're just like in that
routine and not getting out a little bit
you you kind of don't have like youra
moments or anything like that I think my
biggest AA moments were like when I was
taking vacation or days off or anything
like that so you kind of like got to
look from other perspective uh from time
to time but what I think about like
being Rusty or anything the way I want
to deal with that is to prioritize
better on my routine on that hierarchy
that we were talking about so in putting
like study and playing in putting
playing on on a better on a better uh
way and and one thing that I wanted to
do in 2021 was like oh I'm gonna play
more so uh if there's 1K tables running
good 1K tables I'm going to play uh I'm
going to play like multiple sites I'm
just going to play 1K then I started to
play then I see like two guys SE it at
5K and say oh [ __ ] 1K let's see let's
play one let's play 5K so if I I want to
be like more disciplined in this way of
not like uh not because instead of
playing I don't know eight tables of 1K
if I'm like r r battling three table uh
r b r battling three-handed 5K like I
gotta close the other tables and just
play in 5K so that kind of leads you to
less volume to less uh decisions so
being a little bit more discipline with
that in the sense of not wanting to just
like uh to just being very very
competitive you know like I think I
think that can be that can be good for
YouTu to become more used to play and
then your thought process kind of kind
of got better because if you just I'm
gonna play here and then I'm gonna try
to see this table and then you kind
of lose that so being more a full grind
with a lot of tables and just playing a
little bit
more yeah I mean a part of the learning
process is also applying it and
repeating it right to really get it
stuck in your head also you will notice
certain nuances that maybe when you were
just studying you didn't notice I think
in your situation I also hear a little
bit of conflict in between what you
think is important I remember also in
the questionnaire you know we usually
ask a couple of questions where you have
to choose and I remember you wrote it
down I'm a gambler at heart instead of
playing it safe so shutting the 5K table
is in line with it also you like the
challenge so maybe in terms of uh maybe
it's good also for yourself maybe after
this podcast to reflect upon why do you
want to play 1K I mean if what what does
it me for you right I think throughout
your career it's like you never really
like the
repetition just grinding for hourly for
example maybe that's also why you got
into coaching for example for me as well
I would never play high volume
so I was always like okay what do I like
to do I like to study okay well what if
I study and get students to play for me
right they can make the volume I could
do the studying perfect nice then after
two years of only studying I was like
okay I actually would like to play now
again as well right so it's balance yeah
it's basically the same feeling um about
the questionary and the question I
remember that I tank it in in this one a
little bit because I kind of have both
and I I I answer this one more in this
sense like uh like I want to play 5K I
remember like three three or four
Sundays I just woke up like little bit
hangover off the Saturday and I was like
oh there's some 10K heads up W CP going
on let's play or W sop or whatever and
then I play it some some of Sundays and
then I just played 5K and I I um my my
psychologist talks a lot a lot about
that that I'm that I I'm just like
very I don't know FID in in this sense
like I just Just go with it and do it
happy like without any any weight in my
backs or you know like I I always play
very very like without any type of
pressure and that's why I I I answered
this question this way but if you're
going to think like I I was always a
very a very needy with bankroll for
example I only shot it when I had the
bank roll uh I was always very for
example I change it by from mtts to cash
games because of the game but because of
the the fact that the the earnings are
more regular so I kind of have the both
you know I have a a nitty part in in in
this sense also I think it's also
important then let's say for example
let's say take take that uh that hats up
10K that you were talking about you wake
up you sit if afterwards you bust
do you then feel bad about your
decision no only if I yeah only if I
like I don't know if I make a mistake
because I was not prepared like didn't
thought that like oh my God I'm going to
play I'm gonna sleep well Etc but if not
if if like the way I if if that didn't
uh had any impact on on my poker
decisions my strategic decisions then I
would just feel feel fine and to be
honest I never regret of any any stuff
that I that I did any shot that I made
or anything like that I don't I don't
remember I think that's the most
important thing right you're you're just
expressing yourself this is just who you
are you know you try to be planned but
sometimes you know you just give
yourself the freedom to be you basically
and you are this spontaneous guy who
when he sees a 5k table was like ah I
feel like playing why not exactly I
think the only the only problem would
occur is if afterwards you would
immediately regret that action you know
but if you don't have that then it's
just an expression of who you are so
yeah a lot of uh a lot of good stuff uh
m a lot of good stuff any any final
questions Adam before we uh let this guy
go to the beach we've had a lot of
questions today see I've just got one
final question quite a light-hearted one
but what are you most excited for in
2022 what are you most looking forward
to for the year
ahead nice
H I'm kind of equal
in in two stuffs so Tim the Tim I
already I think already made uh most of
the work that I want to do so I think
the two things are more related to my
career myself
um
and it's it's obviously I don't know if
you if you ask it in poker or in life Al
but I would say the two things are are
related to to work in in in uh anyways
so it would
be some stuff that I want to to to study
uh I think it that's number one so
findings that I want to study things
that I already H have in my mind to go
deep and second one is to perform I
would say to perform as a player uh
thing that I I couldn't do like the last
two years so I'm putting a little bit of
more volume um I'm I'm not say very yeah
I'm very pumped to that very very pumped
to that to see if to to challenge myself
and and into being a little bit more
grinder so yeah changing a little bit of
that uh that state that I that I have
been in in the last
years perfect more challenges and more
problems to solve fits in well with
theme yeah R have you got any closing
questions any closing words no uh unless
uh Mr Z wants to share anything more I
think we can call an end um any last
words for
you um I don't think so because you guys
made a lot of good questions so I think
just to to finish I want to thank you
guys and congratulate you guys for for
for this work um from for the the Pod
especially but for the work with the
company and I already said to you uh H
that I that you you were an inspiration
to me so I'm very very grateful for
being here um I really respect uh your
journey really really respect respect
your work Adam also that I I already
watched a little bit of the other pods
that you guys did but uh today I met and
could talk Witham and I really I really

good questions point out very good
important stuff so I learn I learned it
a lot here also so I'm very grateful for
that and I really enjoy to do that and
to talk to smart smart guys that have a
lot to offer uh we can always learn a
lot so thanks for inviting inviting me
to be here it's a great honor and yeah I
one thing that I want to point out also
that I think we didn't point out that
much is the work that I do with Mr CPO
that is my
psychologist uh he's a guy that he very
very experien of Life have like I think
he's 55 years old he's an ex aete also
he was like uh I don't know how to say
that but like heu will help help me like
r h a rer yeah like the the thing that
you do in the I I I didn't get it from
the word but I just saw the mov like you
know he he was an athlete from Flamingo
that you probably know that in h so he
worked there a lot and then he uh he did
like educ how how is it called like
physic educ personal trainer yeah like
physic education and then he he went to
psychologist
uh he studied like in Boston PhD Etc so
he's a guy that have been helping me a
lot with a lot of stuffs not only poker
related but
in in life in relationship in the team
in how to manage the team he also helps
us in some um in some opinions on on on
the on the company also so this work I
having I I will complete like one and a
half year working with him and have been
pretty pretty good and yeah I hope that
2022 can be can be very good for
me all right that's uh that's awesome
man yeah I was really happy talking to
you I think there was so much goodness
in this uh in this podcast really happy
to have had you want to share your
thoughts I hope I hope we can can bring
a lot of value for for the audience uh I
hope the guys enjoy uh I gave my best
I'm pretty sure you guys gave your best
also and yeah thanks for being here and
yeah see you guys all right we standed
off Matos to the beach enjoying his
holiday and uh we had a lot to recap
didn't we Adam we did yeah try to
condense the last few hours into some
takeaway lessons that we've learned it's
been challenging but hopefully we can
give a good
summary what were some of the things
that uh stood out to you yeah some of
the things that keep kept coming up
throughout where his ability to uh
almost like go back and rebuild stuff I
think there was a few times in his
career where there was very challenging
moments I think he talked about 2016
when he transitioned from mtts to cash
games he had to go back and like build
the fundamentals like the real start of
the game tree and learn poker from
scratch and then he had like a similar
kind of go back to basics when he
started playing high stakes and he had
to uh again readapt his strategy and go
back to kind of the lab and Rec come up
with a new strategy and once we dug a
bit deeper on that we could see that he
loves building stuff he loves breaking
stuff and rebuilding it better so he's
got this kind of problem solving nature
which has built I think from Curiosity
and also this kind of competitive nature
where he's always trying to do things
better and put effort into things um so
yeah I feel like he's somebody who's
mastered that ability to be disciplined
on a Pursuit whil else trying to tweak
stuff and solve problems and as we got
throughout the conversation so many
different things he's done so many
different challenges he's taken on and
he's somebody who I feel like is always
in motion if we speak to him in two
years time you have another challenge
another fresh thing in another business
he's someone who's always seeking that
because he's someone who likes that
environment of taking on challenges and
growing so yeah a million takeaways I
could go on but that was the the main
ones I got from him some strong
character traits I think he's developed
curiosity discipline problem solving
ability and facing challenges with kind
of an intrigued mind and want to rebuild
stuff I think were really strong ones
that came through for me so what are
some of your takeaways R have you got
any summaries from that amazing
conversation yeah and important as well
to noce to to mention that he does it
not necessarily because of what he's
gonna get out of it it's it's the road
itself right he likes just being in that
moment in that environment figuring it
out that's what he enjoys day in day out
and as he mentioned it doesn't mean that
every day is easy it doesn't mean that
he doesn't do things that you know
sometimes he has to do stuff that he
doesn't want to do but you know all
around just you know growing as a person
and putting himself in those situation
that's where he thrives and where he
feels most happy right and that's in the
end what his main goal was and then not
happiness because he achieved something
but happiness dayto day in how he lives
his life um technical speaking also a
lot of good stuff focus on the why right
we are uh big Advocates of that here at
poker ambition as well but not only in
solvers but also in terms of studying
data I actually gave a webinar a week
ago about pros and cons of working with
population data and there I say as well
look at the why don't just see a number
and be like okay I'm gonna over folder
I'm gonna underfold I'm gonna over Bluff
here but try to ask yourself hey why is
this spot an overfolded spot what do
people do with their range that led to
this spot and if you figure that out you
can then be ahead hey if that's true
then probably in this spot they
underfold or this spot they overfall and
when you when you understand that bigger
concept you can apply it in different
spots different games because you
understand how humans play poker right
this is something that he also mentioned
and then he talked about natural hands
versus unnatural hands unnatural is what
the solver does and natural is what
humans tend to do and in the end we play
against humans right he also touched on
some good things about the paranoid
exploitative uh the paranoid that also
comes with exploitative play I think uh
he made some very good comments on that
so yeah overall very happy to have had
him on uh I think it was a great guest
and uh for the people who are willing to
learn something from it I mean there was
there was so much in here that people
can learn from don't you agree I agree I
think there's lots of lessons to unpack
I can't wait to relisten myself go over
it and reflect on it because I think
there was a a lot of really powerful
Concepts and also some things that were
really simplified like one of the
questions I asked him was what was his
definition of success it's quite a hard
question to answer but his was be happy
and when you really stop and reflect on
that like it's such a it's a nice way to
simplify your life even when you're
trying to achieve stuff this is a high
stakes pocker player who's running a
business that has 130 Stak Keys he's got
all sorts going on that he could Define
as successful but be happy was very
clear it's like what you've touched on
with the Brazilians they're very good at
being happy they can simplify the
success tree the top of the success tree
often is a happy person so yeah I think
it's really refreshing to see a player
who is achieving a lot but he's also
looking after himself and prizing his
happiness over everything else so yeah
really looking forward to uh getting the
feedback on this from you viewers see
what you've enjoyed but also myself
going back over the episode to uh to
relearn some lessons yeah after after
talking to him and learning everything
about him and as you mentioned the
character traits it's no no coincidence
that he has reached the levels of
success that he has I'm sure many more
success to come in this F and as you
mentioned probably also is something
else as as he gets bored of this that he
moves on to something different all
right I want to thank everyone for
