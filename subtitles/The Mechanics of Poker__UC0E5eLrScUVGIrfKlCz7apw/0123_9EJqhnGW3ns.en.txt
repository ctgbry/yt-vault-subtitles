[00:32]
your pain points we will be discussing
all areas that you can improve in to

taught by coaches who have walked the
path that you are currently walking so
if you're interested go over to the site
and looking forward to seeing you in the
academy
so today's special day guys as you can

[00:46]
so today's special day guys as you can
see in the title
poker ambition free rule so yeah
basically today guys is going to be the
first edition of the pokemon vision
academy free row if you're in the
academy you can join the free roll win
free [ __ ] and most importantly score
points for

[01:01]
points for
the grand final which is in a couple of
months the people the subscribers with
the highest points get to play that and
in there we're gonna give away a free
mechanics of poker before it's very plus
a v i love these spots that are close
that are probably only making a couple

[01:15]
that are probably only making a couple
bb
in terms of a hero call or in terms of a
bluff but they do end up losing a stack
losing another stack losing another
stack
and then it becomes a little bit uh
a little bit annoying

[01:30]
all right let's focus on turning sets
given the fact that bay is still in the
hand
don't want to just call and let him

[01:46]
don't want to just call and let him
basically realize his traits
and stuff for free
and calls

[02:02]
considering a dunk
probably okay to have a dunking range
here
a little razor easy

[02:15]
and if he gems over us we're gonna call
and hope he doesn't have 910
i was probably out of 10
this one i'll go

[02:30]
this one i'll go
fall this time
you can go either way
gonna be close
so long just subscribe thank you very
much sir
you do realize you must be a subscriber
to our academy right not to the

[02:47]
to our academy right not to the
if you subscribe to join the free world
that was a that was a mistake but i
still i appreciate it
a little donkey donkey okay for the fans
i know uh some other people say that you

[03:00]
i know uh some other people say that you
shouldn't dunk but uh we don't agree you
[ __ ] dunk you do it again i remember
in a video before i've told you to not
dunk why do you do that why do you do
that so dumb

[03:15]
there's another bed actually i'm just
gonna fold straight away
i have a pretty bad hand
to give you guys an idea
so far there's 13 players
okay a lot of guys who are actually in
the academy didn't show up for the free
rule which is a waste

[03:31]
rule which is a waste
free money guys
maybe they'll join uh on the later site
but yeah so the chances of you uh
getting some good points this free roll
winning some prizes are quite big 13
players also you get extra point if you

[03:45]
players also you get extra point if you
kick me out there's a bounty on my head
here queen six gonna go for the check
race
probably a good candidate to check the
turn with
and now probably over but the river i

[04:01]
and now probably over but the river i
think is the correct play
deck raising again actually could also
be an option given our hand i think six
is we definitely over bet six is also
way more likely to bet the turn

[04:19]
a little ten percent a year for defense

[04:30]
cold
turn is interesting
very good board for him
don't imagine that we ever do any
betting
probably just check range

[04:47]
here we face a race i'm going to call i
think he could play the same hand this
way and he could sometimes bluff like
king queen or something
or king eight
the other option

[05:02]
awesome podcast renee
ah
you're referring to the poker city
as we actually recorded our own podcast
mechanics of poker podcast
yesterday and i was like how did you

[05:15]
yesterday and i was like how did you
already listen to the podcast
but no
ace jack
okay and you're dead sir you're very
much dead

[05:31]
i made it straight and a flush that's a
little bit overkill won't you say guys
it's a little bit
a little bit overkill

[05:47]
fatality

good luck good luck good luck guys
so uh
tournament skills guys

[06:30]
tournament skills guys
show off our tournament skills today
people's mouths will drop
okay probably not

[06:49]
got any aces at poker bish and clanty
mentioned the other day on stream he
wanted to play with charlie carroll at
5k how big of a spot do you think
charlie carroll is
from what i've seen he seems to play

[07:00]
from what i've seen he seems to play
pretty well for someone who doesn't use
solvers or study i mean
he's definitely not a big uh
big fish
what you're gonna do
need mark which means
he's marked but he isn't

[07:15]
he's marked but he isn't
you know
let's just see a flop
you know what i do like about
tournaments
you can flat ball
there's way more flat going

[07:31]
now that's uh back to straight draw over
card flush or something
mark goes for a check very smart you
probably bet this some of the time
for it

[07:55]
oh then if you're stupid mark good just
god
that's an interesting turn

[08:17]
a little barrel barrel barrel ski
what you're gonna do what you gonna do
when the weka barrels you i have a bad
hand to battery street so we prefer him

[08:31]
hand to battery street so we prefer him
to just fold okay
our hand just got a little bit better
now what do we do
we should definitely value that because
we have the az club so unlikely that he

[08:46]
we have the az club so unlikely that he
is the azy club
yeah
go for a bad nosh
hey
timed out

[09:00]
okay now out of time bank
you missed today's free road guys no
worries
there's plenty of there's a free river
month and you know if uh
there's a little point awards and in the
end
i think after four months there's the

[09:15]
i think after four months there's the
grand final then we just look at
from the subscribers who has most points
and then the top nine in points
they get to join the the final let's
flop a set

[09:30]
i am lucky i am skillful and i will win
you gotta feel it
that is
no that's not a set
you probably call one

[09:46]
but it's close
check

[10:02]
[Music]
hey little value bet get called thank
you very much sir i'm your flop set
you know what they say
set ain't bad
or at least that's what i say

[10:16]
or at least that's what i say
uh sneaky check back here with the sixes
why not
[ __ ] it
hey nothing oh we got ace king

[10:31]
hey nothing oh we got ace king
asking guys that's a good hunter
another three bed
good flop

[11:03]
okay i guess i automatically checked
that's obviously not what i wanted but
hey
even the typing restrictions

[11:15]
s plate i guess i'll check again but
a bit of a waste built already
on checking any mugs

[11:31]
on checking any mugs
popping a set with nines
easy cop
first the barrel

[11:49]
i would have folded versus the barrel
and sevens or eights with the diamond
would be better cause
if you even want to call a pair

[12:02]
start with that though
and i think on a river ever easy check
raising over the packet threes

[12:25]
put in here calls

[12:34]
goes without saying that this is not
really the turn i was looking for but
definitely going to continue betting
he didn't raise it that's good

[12:45]
he didn't raise it that's good
we never probably the best hand
you follow it with the five three
unfortunately recognize some screen
names here you mean in the free roll

[13:06]
uh these guys these guys were smart
enough to calculate the eevee of the
academy
i'm telling you guys it's plus eve to
join the academy
i've made calculations it's

[13:16]
i've made calculations it's
very likely to be
very plush v actually i just saw now
that julia is here as me as avatar i
didn't see that before shout out to
julius
let's see maybe i can make it big bigger

[13:30]
let's see maybe i can make it big bigger
so you guys can see it look
let him get the other hand you see
shout out to julius man nice avatar

[13:47]
um
[Music]
nine
ten yes we can we can make a straight
flush all the time should probably check
raises some of the time
a5 you feels like on an 85

[14:02]
a5 you feels like on an 85
that is doable
that's a good turn

[14:20]
go for the double check race

[14:43]
oh straight over straight

[14:45]
oh straight over straight
and that's very unlucky but hey give it
to me baby
give me [ __ ] what the
[ __ ] oh we have pocket aces

[15:00]
[ __ ] oh we have pocket aces
let's limp that
