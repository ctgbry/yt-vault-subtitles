Um and I thought with that approach I

[11:28]
Um and I thought with that approach I

[11:28]
Um and I thought with that approach I
have a chance but not really big because

[11:30]
have a chance but not really big because

have a chance but not really big because
I thought that at the mistakes there

[11:33]
I thought that at the mistakes there

[11:33]
I thought that at the mistakes there
will be a lot of guys who could put like

will be a lot of guys who could put like
uh 100k hands volume.

[11:40]
uh 100k hands volume.

[11:40]
uh 100k hands volume.
&gt;&gt; Were you uh surprised you mentioned like

[11:42]
&gt;&gt; Were you uh surprised you mentioned like

[11:42]
&gt;&gt; Were you uh surprised you mentioned like
uh the volume and that going in you

[11:44]
uh the volume and that going in you

[11:44]
uh the volume and that going in you
thought that you know a certain minimum

[11:46]
thought that you know a certain minimum

[11:46]
thought that you know a certain minimum
volume was required. I think in the end

[11:47]
volume was required. I think in the end

[11:48]
volume was required. I think in the end
you ended probably top five in volume if

[11:50]
you ended probably top five in volume if

[11:50]
you ended probably top five in volume if
I'm not mistaken. uh somewhere people

[11:54]
I'm not mistaken. uh somewhere people

I'm not mistaken. uh somewhere people
were not putting in more volume.

and uh the other thing uh I thought was
that it's a good learning opportunity

[12:27]
that it's a good learning opportunity

that it's a good learning opportunity
because with showdowns you just uh can

[12:31]

the most hours as I can no matter what

[12:48]
the most hours as I can no matter what

the most hours as I can no matter what
just because of the learning opportunity

um fing almost most more fing all of the

more because uh the meta um wasn't

Stefan was playing and I didn't I never

Stefan was playing and I didn't I never
played against him and he was in every

[22:28]
played against him and he was in every

[22:28]
played against him and he was in every
table and just because you have him on

[22:31]
table and just because you have him on

[22:31]
table and just because you have him on
the table you have to really be careful

[22:33]
the table you have to really be careful

[22:33]
the table you have to really be careful
with your pre flop. If you want to play,

[22:35]
with your pre flop. If you want to play,

[22:35]
with your pre flop. If you want to play,
you got to play that really aggressive.

[22:37]
you got to play that really aggressive.

[22:37]
you got to play that really aggressive.
If not, it's better maybe not to play

[22:38]
If not, it's better maybe not to play

[22:38]
If not, it's better maybe not to play
it. So, I think meta was also kind of

[22:42]
it. So, I think meta was also kind of

[22:42]
it. So, I think meta was also kind of
adapting. I think second week or third

[22:43]
adapting. I think second week or third

[22:43]

also the pre flop was not as wide as the

[22:59]
also the pre flop was not as wide as the

also the pre flop was not as wide as the
first week. So I think everyone got a

[23:02]
first week. So I think everyone got a

[23:02]
first week. So I think everyone got a
little bit uh they just if they were

[23:04]
little bit uh they just if they were

little bit uh they just if they were
here they put a one less pressure.

[23:08]

here they put a one less pressure.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It seemed like everyone the guys

and sometimes they were contradicted. So
they just changed they adapted from the

[27:52]
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

[27:52]
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; So, that's what's going on.

[27:53]
&gt;&gt; So, that's what's going on.

[27:53]
&gt;&gt; So, that's what's going on.
&gt;&gt; The more out of line it is, you know,

[27:55]
&gt;&gt; The more out of line it is, you know,

[27:55]
&gt;&gt; The more out of line it is, you know,
the the bigger the adjustment will be.

[27:57]
the the bigger the adjustment will be.

[27:57]
the the bigger the adjustment will be.
And that hand was like off the charts

[27:58]
And that hand was like off the charts

[27:58]
And that hand was like off the charts
out of line. So, um, yeah, I just made a

[28:02]
out of line. So, um, yeah, I just made a

[28:02]
out of line. So, um, yeah, I just made a
note like, you know, you you need to

&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean I haven't played that much

[30:40]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean I haven't played that much

[30:40]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean I haven't played that much
but I think it was kind of uh good

[30:45]
but I think it was kind of uh good

[30:45]
but I think it was kind of uh good
because um not many people were used to

[30:48]
because um not many people were used to

[30:48]
because um not many people were used to
play with antis not only myself. So I

[30:51]
play with antis not only myself. So I

[30:51]
play with antis not only myself. So I
think if I study that fast and adapt

[30:54]
think if I study that fast and adapt

[30:54]
think if I study that fast and adapt
well I could have an edge on that

[30:56]
well I could have an edge on that

[30:56]
well I could have an edge on that
because it's not only that I don't know

[30:58]
because it's not only that I don't know

[30:58]
because it's not only that I don't know
is that maybe it's new for most of the

[31:00]
is that maybe it's new for most of the

[31:00]
is that maybe it's new for most of the
opponents. I guess if the opponents that

[31:03]
opponents. I guess if the opponents that

[31:03]
opponents. I guess if the opponents that
will have more experience with that will

[31:05]
will have more experience with that will

[31:05]
will have more experience with that will
have an edge, but because I thought most

[31:07]
have an edge, but because I thought most

[31:07]
have an edge, but because I thought most
of the meta, most of the Rexs haven't

[31:09]
of the meta, most of the Rexs haven't

[31:09]
of the meta, most of the Rexs haven't
played that much with antis. I think it

[31:11]
played that much with antis. I think it

[31:11]
played that much with antis. I think it
was something that could be an advantage

[31:14]
was something that could be an advantage

[31:14]
was something that could be an advantage
for me if I get to adapt quicker. So

[31:17]
for me if I get to adapt quicker. So

[31:17]
for me if I get to adapt quicker. So
yeah, I think most of the guys weren't

[31:19]
yeah, I think most of the guys weren't

[31:19]
yeah, I think most of the guys weren't
playing pre flop correctly. I h saw the

[31:22]
playing pre flop correctly. I h saw the

[31:22]
playing pre flop correctly. I h saw the
preflop charge on wither and that you

[31:24]
preflop charge on wither and that you

[31:24]
preflop charge on wither and that you
have to make some not standard calls on

[31:27]
have to make some not standard calls on

[31:27]
have to make some not standard calls on
the bottom and only a small bl. I I

don't think that many uh people were

[31:33]
don't think that many uh people were

[31:33]
don't think that many uh people were
doing that. Basically, if you open two

[31:35]
doing that. Basically, if you open two

[31:35]
doing that. Basically, if you open two
eggs on the bottom, you have to call

[31:37]
eggs on the bottom, you have to call

[31:38]
eggs on the bottom, you have to call
queen five suited in the small blind or

[31:40]
queen five suited in the small blind or

[31:40]
queen five suited in the small blind or
something like that. So, yeah, I think

[31:42]
something like that. So, yeah, I think

[31:42]
something like that. So, yeah, I think
um there was uh some kind of pre flop

[31:46]
um there was uh some kind of pre flop

[31:46]
um there was uh some kind of pre flop
edge in that kind of situations. And if

[31:49]
edge in that kind of situations. And if

[31:49]
edge in that kind of situations. And if
you don't have the pre flop correctly,

[31:51]
you don't have the pre flop correctly,

[31:51]
you don't have the pre flop correctly,
then you're going to mess up a little

[31:53]
then you're going to mess up a little

then you're going to mess up a little

these weaker flushes.

[34:32]
these weaker flushes.

And so I couldn't just free bet fold the

challenge progressed, I got a lot more

Whereas other guys, you know, who try to

[47:45]
Whereas other guys, you know, who try to

[47:45]
Whereas other guys, you know, who try to
play more quotequote GTO and they just

[47:48]
play more quotequote GTO and they just

[47:48]
play more quotequote GTO and they just
switch a little bit with their

[47:50]
switch a little bit with their

[47:50]
switch a little bit with their
frequencies. But with you, I saw a

[47:51]
frequencies. But with you, I saw a

[47:51]

couple hands that were like, wait, if

[47:54]
couple hands that were like, wait, if

[47:54]
couple hands that were like, wait, if
this hand is in there, that what's in

[47:55]
this hand is in there, that what's in

[47:55]
this hand is in there, that what's in
there? But later, I kind of found out,

[47:56]
there? But later, I kind of found out,

[47:56]
there? But later, I kind of found out,
you know, you just kind of play more the

[47:58]
you know, you just kind of play more the

[47:58]
you know, you just kind of play more the
spot when you just feel like the spot is

[48:00]
spot when you just feel like the spot is

[48:00]
spot when you just feel like the spot is
right or you have a read in your

[48:01]
right or you have a read in your

right or you have a read in your
opponent, you you're not afraid to go

[48:03]
opponent, you you're not afraid to go

[48:03]
opponent, you you're not afraid to go
for it. So, I feel like that definitely

[48:04]
for it. So, I feel like that definitely

[48:04]
for it. So, I feel like that definitely
contributes like if you see a couple of

[48:06]
contributes like if you see a couple of

[48:06]
contributes like if you see a couple of
hands like wait, what is this hand doing

[48:08]
hands like wait, what is this hand doing

[48:08]
hands like wait, what is this hand doing
in here, you know? So, then it's very

[48:09]
in here, you know? So, then it's very

[48:09]
in here, you know? So, then it's very
easy to draw big conclusions and

[48:11]
easy to draw big conclusions and

[48:11]
easy to draw big conclusions and
definitely I think that helped. uh uh

thinking a lot about right about that.

[49:55]

Um and the same thing as like when bluff

such a different experience than playing

[50:04]
such a different experience than playing

[50:04]
such a different experience than playing
normally. And yeah, as I said before,

[50:07]
normally. And yeah, as I said before,

[50:07]
normally. And yeah, as I said before,
like in the m middle of the challenge, I

[50:10]
like in the m middle of the challenge, I

[50:10]
like in the m middle of the challenge, I
really feel like I had a super good

[50:12]
really feel like I had a super good

[50:12]
really feel like I had a super good
feeling whether people were like over

[50:16]
feeling whether people were like over

[50:16]
feeling whether people were like over
bluffing or not. And in the end, for

[50:18]
bluffing or not. And in the end, for

[50:18]
bluffing or not. And in the end, for
some reason, I I just like

[50:22]
some reason, I I just like

[50:22]
some reason, I I just like
I had a worse intuition or whatever. I

[50:25]
I had a worse intuition or whatever. I

[50:25]
I had a worse intuition or whatever. I
don't know why. I just it just feel like

[50:27]
don't know why. I just it just feel like

[50:27]
don't know why. I just it just feel like
I maybe just because the players were

[50:29]
I maybe just because the players were

[50:29]
I maybe just because the players were
better, right? um in the in the end. So,

[50:32]
better, right? um in the in the end. So,

[50:32]
better, right? um in the in the end. So,
they were probably just playing like

[50:34]
they were probably just playing like

[50:34]
they were probably just playing like
better poker and it was harder for me to

[50:36]
better poker and it was harder for me to

&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we definitely uh we

[50:51]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we definitely uh we
definitely tangled quite a lot. It was

[50:53]
definitely tangled quite a lot. It was

[50:53]
definitely tangled quite a lot. It was
uh it was a lot of fun. But I I think we

was a flop in in in in the podcast and
he also said uh in general like people

[51:02]
he also said uh in general like people

[51:02]
he also said uh in general like people
were switching it up week by week. Uh so

[51:06]
were switching it up week by week. Uh so

[51:06]
were switching it up week by week. Uh so
people are also kind of changing to the

[51:07]
people are also kind of changing to the

[51:08]
people are also kind of changing to the
meta in different ways and obviously you

[51:10]
meta in different ways and obviously you

[51:10]
meta in different ways and obviously you
know there's some some just card

[51:12]
know there's some some just card

[51:12]
know there's some some just card
distribution variance in terms of the

[51:13]
distribution variance in terms of the

[51:13]
distribution variance in terms of the

challenge right you play every day and

[51:17]
challenge right you play every day and

challenge right you play every day and
also yeah some weeks you just you know

[51:19]
also yeah some weeks you just you know

[51:19]
also yeah some weeks you just you know
you feel it more than than other weeks

[51:21]
you feel it more than than other weeks

you feel it more than than other weeks
right so obviously there's swings in

[51:23]
right so obviously there's swings in

[51:23]
right so obviously there's swings in
performance there as well um but yeah

&gt;&gt; yeah yeah what moments of love was
definitely one of the guys that

[51:31]
definitely one of the guys that

[51:31]
definitely one of the guys that
uh I could not figure out like sort

uh I could not figure out like sort
like he was definitely capable of

[51:37]
like he was definitely capable of

[51:37]
like he was definitely capable of
switching up, you know. So like that for

[51:39]
switching up, you know. So like that for

[51:39]
switching up, you know. So like that for
sure there's going to be spots where he

[51:41]
sure there's going to be spots where he

[51:41]
sure there's going to be spots where he
play against me where he would never

[51:42]
play against me where he would never

[51:42]
play against me where he would never
bluff and I call down figure he would be

[51:44]
bluff and I call down figure he would be

[51:44]
bluff and I call down figure he would be
bluffing and vice versa. So like yeah

[51:48]
bluffing and vice versa. So like yeah

[51:48]
bluffing and vice versa. So like yeah
that's uh definitely a good player.

[51:51]
that's uh definitely a good player.

[51:51]
that's uh definitely a good player.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well I uh start having data on

[51:54]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well I uh start having data on

[51:54]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well I uh start having data on
also most of the players because I was

[51:57]
also most of the players because I was

[51:57]
also most of the players because I was
playing I don't know 20k hands per week.

[52:00]
playing I don't know 20k hands per week.

[52:00]
playing I don't know 20k hands per week.
So yeah, I kind of study some of them.

[52:04]
So yeah, I kind of study some of them.

[52:04]
So yeah, I kind of study some of them.
It's not a big amount of data that you

[52:08]
It's not a big amount of data that you

[52:08]
It's not a big amount of data that you
have to study because it has a lot of

[52:10]
have to study because it has a lot of

[52:10]
have to study because it has a lot of
variance, but you can see the

[52:12]
variance, but you can see the

[52:12]
variance, but you can see the
tendencies. So I think my strategy was

[52:14]
tendencies. So I think my strategy was

[52:14]
tendencies. So I think my strategy was
just trying to distinguish the ress that

[52:17]
just trying to distinguish the ress that

[52:17]
just trying to distinguish the ress that
were ready to battle every hand that the

[52:19]
were ready to battle every hand that the

[52:19]
were ready to battle every hand that the
ones that were maybe more conservative.

[52:22]
ones that were maybe more conservative.

[52:22]
ones that were maybe more conservative.
So uh overall my strategy was just to

[52:26]
So uh overall my strategy was just to

[52:26]
So uh overall my strategy was just to
try to

[52:28]
try to

[52:28]
try to
uh change my mind

[52:31]
uh change my mind

[52:31]
uh change my mind
because I have like a big tendency of

[52:33]
because I have like a big tendency of

[52:33]
because I have like a big tendency of
myself of playing the previous meta I

[52:37]
myself of playing the previous meta I

[52:37]
myself of playing the previous meta I
was playing in my normal uh cast game

[52:39]
was playing in my normal uh cast game

[52:39]
was playing in my normal uh cast game
and in any situation I was like having

[52:42]
and in any situation I was like having

[52:42]
and in any situation I was like having
this um

[52:45]
this um

[52:45]
this um
mental guide that okay this is spot is

[52:47]
mental guide that okay this is spot is

[52:47]
mental guide that okay this is spot is
on the bluff and sometimes I was just

[52:49]
on the bluff and sometimes I was just

[52:49]
on the bluff and sometimes I was just
thinking too much about it but then I

[52:51]
thinking too much about it but then I

[52:51]
thinking too much about it but then I
have to really make sure that that spot

[52:55]
have to really make sure that that spot

[52:55]
have to really make sure that that spot
was under bluff against this opponent

[52:58]
was under bluff against this opponent

[52:58]
was under bluff against this opponent
and because the coin poker meta was

[53:01]
and because the coin poker meta was

[53:01]
and because the coin poker meta was
completely out of line in my opinion in

[53:03]
completely out of line in my opinion in

[53:03]
completely out of line in my opinion in
most of the cases. So it was just a

[53:06]
most of the cases. So it was just a

[53:06]
most of the cases. So it was just a
challenge for myself to just not uh be

[53:09]
challenge for myself to just not uh be

[53:09]
challenge for myself to just not uh be
able to think what I was just having

[53:11]
able to think what I was just having

[53:11]
able to think what I was just having
inside of mind because I just doing for

[53:13]
inside of mind because I just doing for

[53:13]
inside of mind because I just doing for
the last two years but to try to play

[53:18]
the last two years but to try to play

[53:18]
the last two years but to try to play
mostly the opponents and not your not my

[53:20]
mostly the opponents and not your not my

[53:20]
mostly the opponents and not your not my
hand because yeah I have to look blue

[53:23]
hand because yeah I have to look blue

[53:23]
hand because yeah I have to look blue
cuts quite more than I would I'm used

[53:25]
cuts quite more than I would I'm used

[53:25]
cuts quite more than I would I'm used
to. have to maybe

[53:28]
to. have to maybe

[53:28]
to. have to maybe
not bluff enough in this situation where

[53:31]
not bluff enough in this situation where

[53:31]
not bluff enough in this situation where
they just gonna call any blue cards

[53:34]
they just gonna call any blue cards

[53:34]
they just gonna call any blue cards
against other players. So probably

[53:38]
against other players. So probably

[53:38]
against other players. So probably
uh yeah have less aggression in certain

[53:41]
uh yeah have less aggression in certain

[53:41]
uh yeah have less aggression in certain
spots and blue cards more in every

[53:44]
spots and blue cards more in every

[53:44]
spots and blue cards more in every
situation which is something I do

[53:46]
situation which is something I do

[53:46]
situation which is something I do
opposite in in my actual uh cast games.

[53:50]
opposite in in my actual uh cast games.

[53:50]
opposite in in my actual uh cast games.
I tend to be more aggressive um a little

[53:53]
I tend to be more aggressive um a little

[53:53]
I tend to be more aggressive um a little
bit more forward than in the challenge.

[53:54]
bit more forward than in the challenge.

[53:54]
bit more forward than in the challenge.
Yeah, I think I think on average that's

[53:57]
Yeah, I think I think on average that's

[53:57]
Yeah, I think I think on average that's
going to be the right adjustment for the

[53:58]
going to be the right adjustment for the

[53:58]
going to be the right adjustment for the
