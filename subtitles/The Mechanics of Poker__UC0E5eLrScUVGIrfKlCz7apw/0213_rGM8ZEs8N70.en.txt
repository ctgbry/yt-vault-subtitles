in these 100 to $200 buyings to playing

[1:17:12]
in these 100 to $200 buyings to playing

[1:17:12]
in these 100 to $200 buyings to playing
mostly with good RS at 500 in one case I

[1:17:17]
mostly with good RS at 500 in one case I

[1:17:17]
mostly with good RS at 500 in one case I
think the jump from let's say average

buying 500 to average buying 2K isn't

[1:17:22]
buying 500 to average buying 2K isn't

[1:17:22]
buying 500 to average buying 2K isn't
that big because most of the RS are the

500s so yeah for me I think that's that

[1:17:34]
500s so yeah for me I think that's that

[1:17:34]
500s so yeah for me I think that's that
is the biggest jump like between 200 and

[1:17:36]
is the biggest jump like between 200 and

[1:17:36]
is the biggest jump like between 200 and
500 so basically the the the jump is the

[1:17:39]
500 so basically the the the jump is the

[1:17:39]
500 so basically the the the jump is the
highest where the elite like basically

[1:17:42]
highest where the elite like basically

[1:17:42]
highest where the elite like basically
the Bottom Buying range of elite recks

[1:17:44]
the Bottom Buying range of elite recks

[1:17:44]
the Bottom Buying range of elite recks
that's where the jump is highest I feel
