I wouldn't say tendency it's more like a
stance that I've chosen to develop which
is sort of always expect the worst so
that you're not disappointed and then
when the wor doesn't come great you're
happy I don't have this kind of
emotional attachment to anything when it
comes to Poker all I think about is how
should I play I just do not care about
all the other aspects have you ever had
to struggle with emotions as a PO player
oh for sure for sure it it wasn't uh
such an easy ride you annoyed by running
bad you're annoyed by losing money
you're annoyed by someone you know you
don't think is good winning more money
than you uh you're annoyed by oh this
guy's tting me all the time he must
think I'm weak now I'm going to prove
him wrong upon sporting a mistake like
that that I should not have made just
like really convince myself really uh
solidify inside me why it happened and
making sure just take every measure it
doesn't happen again understanding that
poer is basically statistics and you
just have to follow the Ms and play your
strategy and click your buttons and then
things will come just not have an
emotional
attachment welcome back to another

let's start today's episode all right
let's get started Alex there he is thank
you for joining us on the
podcast thank you for having me I am
very humbled to be invited after having
so many great names before me I wanted
to start this pod off Alex at the
beginning as I saw that you have a
history of playing various strategy
games at a high level before you got
into poker you mentioned playing chess
Yu-Gi-Oh DOTA Warcraft where did this
interest in strategy games come from and
what is it that you most enjoy about
competing in these type of
games I I guess it started from a very
very young age I mentioned chess I used
to play chess when I was I don't know
like three four five years old some
stupid age like that um I used to go to
some clubs and whatnot and and yeah ever
since I was very young I was always
drawn into strategy games and I think I
just always enjoyed the uh intellectual
stimulation I guess and also competing
in intellectual Sports always uh was
more appealing to me than competing in
like physical Sports so yeah started
with chess then I moved into some video
games as I mentioned I used to play
World of Warcraft competitively for
pretty long time and also a little bit
of DOTA and then yeah some Yu-Gi-Oh
which is kind of similar to Poker I
guess in the sense that it's a card game
physical card
game so yeah Yu-Gi-Oh is very similar to
um what's the other magic right it's
like a similar type of yeah I never I
never play Magic but I think it's very
similar games yeah when did you start I
I think you also mentioned that you
actually were like competing going to
tournaments for Warcraft that was I
believe it was so I used to play World
of Warcraft at the highest level This
World of Warcraft isn't exactly
tournament it's more like you get a
group of 25 people and you try to do
things faster than your
competition so it was this like massive
online competition that would happen
every few months and I used to play in
the best things in the world it was
pretty much a full-time job as well so
how does it look like to be a full-time
Warcraft player yeah yeah that's what
that's what I was doing during my last
years in school yeah so so how does it
like how does it look like like the life
of a full-time work Warcraft
player well um spending a lot of time at
home of course so for playing um and
then also just getting to work from a
pretty young age I think wasn't
something a lot of people were doing but
was also a kind of job that I enjoyed
because obviously playing a game to like
is pretty enjoyable kind of singular to
Poker right same idea you pick up a
hobby and then you turn it into your
job you mentioned that uh yeah go ahead
one quick fun story as I told you we
used to be in some I used to be in some
of the best teams out there and World of
Warcraft is owned by blizzard it's a
very massive Corporation and every year
it holds this meeting I guess where they
showcase their new products and so on
and me and my team we were invited so
like five people from my team went there
and the reason I'm mentioning this bit
of a funny story so some guy interviews
us and they asked me my opinion of the
latest updates and I didn't really like
it and I was young and stupid back then
so I just immediately started Wasing
like oh this was a [ __ ] this was
terrible design how did they come up
with that and this didn't go very well
with them and there's this uh YouTube
Interview Somewhere Out There of me just
crushing blizzard in their meeting and
they're like okay let's we want some
feedback but let's at least remind our
Alon this guy's too honest yeah but I
guess it also wasn't very constructive
it was more like okay let's let's just
burn this update to the ground yeah yeah
exactly as I said young and stupid I was
going to say
like 13
14 yeah yeah something like that around
14 15 I think yeah you cannot really
expect a 13 or 14y old to give great
constructive feedback I mean to be fair
it was kind of their their their own
fault in my opinion I mean what did they
expect let's blame them I agree I'm with
you you mentioned that poker is kind of
a combination of all previous games that
you've played which I thought was quite
interesting could you maybe give us an
example of like the cross over between
the games that you played right you
mentioned chess you mentioned Yu-Gi-Oh
you mentioned DOTA Warcraft what kind of
similarities do they have with poker how
do how do they cross over yeah so as you
mentioned I said that poker just
combines everything because first of all
it's an online game for the most part so
it is very hand inand with the video
games I played and a lot of the skills I
acquired through my video game I guess
experience also applies to Poker such as
being able to play many tables and not
losing my attention span and things like
that so gaming definitely helped with
that then there's the strategy aspect
which I think is kind of similar to
chess in the sense that there is the
optimal move and then you need to also
figure out what your opponent is doing
and so on and then of course the card
game aspect which is kind of similar to
Yu-Gi-Oh so yeah it's kind of funny how
all three of my previous experiences in
games led to
Poker what advantages did playing these
these games before have when you started
playing poker did give you a big head
start you
think um I would say in terms of playing
video games it definitely helps with
playing long online sessions because
again you can multitask better you can
manage like 15 tables at the same time
way better if you have a gaming
background because in games you need to
be aware of many things at the same time
oh this is happening there this is
happening there so this definitely just
builds you up for playing long online
sessions and then for the Strat games
just learning to think in terms of Game
Theory optimal approach just trying to
figure out okay this will be better in
the long term this is what I should
do studying wise like how do you study
for like I know chess I think is quite
similar or at least nowadays probably
not when you were playing chess but
nowadays I believe they also work with
like solvers right they compare like the
optimal move it's very similar to like
studying poker the way you studi these
other games did have a crossover where
you're like Well I this is how I got
better at at Warcraft so I'm going to do
exactly the same in
poker so first of all as you said back
then when I was playing chess it wasn't
that much studying I mean I was young as
well and also technology wasn't that
advanced um but for staring for the
games I would say it's not no it doesn't
relate to studing for playing poker that
much I wouldn't say so maybe for
Yu-Gi-Oh that makes sense because you
had to test a lot of things and run some
simulation and stuff like that but
definitely nothing related to Poker and
running all these endless hrcs and
whatnot so I can indeed see like the
crossover between the games that you
played was there anything about poker
that made it very difficult for you to
adjust to right you come from this
background you're a successful Warcraft
player you're like okay well this poker
thing can't be that hard but uh did you
have any what what was what were kind of
the difficulties that came with the Game
of Poker specifically when you
transitioned so I would say the number
one thing is variant especially in
tournaments poker having these extreme
amounts of variant where no matter how
well you play even if you do the right
thing every time you can still be losing
over a quicky long period I would say
this was the toughest thing to get used
to and it's a process it's still a
process for everyone I think going
through big downswings especially when
you think you're doing things right in
all the other games if you play good
you're rewarded pretty much whereas in
poker that's not necessarily related to
each other you can play good and not get
rewarded or you can play bad and then
get rewarded so yeah I would say this
was by far the toughest thing do you
recall any like any any like first
experience where you're like oh [ __ ] I I
I didn't I I didn't think this came with
poker um honestly no it wasn't just one
moment that led to this realization was
just as I was playing more and more and
as became more my job I just started
seeing it daily where I would make what
I thought was the right move and then of
course you don't get rewarded because
it's variance doesn't matter but at the
beginning it's just a bit tough to get
used to that and accept
that um another thing was the
mathematical aspect of worker I was
never any good in maths at all so just
having to learn even basic things like P
ODS and so on took me a while I'm sure
for most people it's nothing but because
I was as I said completely terrible at
maths it was it was a bit of a
process I I I can join the camp of being
a reasonbly terrible web math at some
point I feel like it also becomes more
intuitive I think also in tournament
poker math plays a little bit of a
bigger role or at least when I play a
tournament I feel like I'm calculating
way much more things than I'm if I'm
playing a cash game where things flow a
bit more intuitive right like you don't
actively any more count outs pod outs
it's more of an intuitive thing at some
point right you kind of see like can see
some good things going on here and in
your head probably there's a calculation
but it turns into like an intuitive
feeling of like I should probably
continue with this spot because I see
good things happening it's kind of then
how how it I guess it gets uh how I
guess it gets translated um yeah for
sure because in tournaments you also
have all the extra things like oh ICM R
bringing I need to add like 7% to My
Equity and then oh a bound tournament so
now I need to turn this bound into
equity and yeah definitely way more
things to calculate in the tournament
than in cash games you mentioned that uh
you know when you realized that variance
was a thing you you managed to recognize
variance which I think is definitely a
skill that you need to learn when you
play poker in the beginning right it's
easy to just say a I'm just unlucky blah
blah but you actually recognize the fact
that it was variance and when you did
recognize it was variance how did you go
about improving handling
variance yeah I think what you mentioned
that understanding variance is a skill
set it definitely takes time when you
get into poker because in pretty much
any other career even if there is
variance it's not so visible it's not so
direct sure in any career in order to be
very successful you have to be lucky
have good timing but it's not so clear
as in poker where you win the flip and
you win a million or you lose the flip
and then you end up 10th place or
whatever so in poker variance is way
more brutal and direct now I did uh as
you said realized that yeah variant is
just a very big thing in poker and it
really help me just have a better time I
guess and not really suffer through down
chins because my main focus has been for
a very long time and still is just
playing well like that's all I can
control I cannot control what my
opponents do I cannot control what the
run out is all I can do is just play as
good as I can study improve constantly
and that's it the rest will come and
it's also a bit tough to be I guess
objective with yourself when you're
winning you're going to think you're
playing well when you're losing you're
going to think you're playing terrible
so this is also a skill that you need to
develop just being honest with yourself
whether you're playing well or just
being
lucky how does one develop that skill
like did you do anything like
practically in order to improve in this
or you think it's just a matter of
reinforcing over a long period of time
like this is not how I should think this
is how I should
think I think it was more over a period
of time because okay at the beginning
you win you think you're the best and so
on but then you go through a period
through a downswing and that sort of
humbles you because going through a down
swing makes you doubt yourself more so
then you study more and then you
discover more mistakes you're making
that you were and a where you were doing
so then once you go through this process
that oh I'm making all these mistakes I
don't know that's why I'm losing so when
you fix them and then you go on an
upswing but you still have this doubt in
your head am I doing things right this
time or am I still making mistakes so
for me it was just this process of at
the beginning I had a very high idea of
myself and how I was playing and then
after the first few down swings you get
back down to earth and realize no you're
still terrible at the
game yeah it's it's the funny thing
right with with with variants how it can
kind of put your you can put yourself on
a pedestal and then the the next day you
can really burn yourself to the ground
and be like wow I'm so [ __ ] terrible
uh yeah it's it's funny to see how even
after many years I me I know you've been
playing poker for over 10 years I've
been playing poker for over 10 years
that still you know
sometimes you look back like really I
fell for that again I thought I was way
better than I was or I thought I thought
it was way worse than I actually was
it's like how do I keep still falling
for this [ __ ] uh do you have any like uh
tendencies that you notice in yourself
for example when you either are too
overconfident because things are going
well or that you're too underc confident
when things are not going your
way I wouldn't say tendency it's more
like a stance that I've chosen to
develop which is is sort of always
expect the worst so that you're not
disappointed and then when the worst
doesn't come great you're
happy so I'm going to give you scenario
so let's say you are tolting one out of
10 or something a lot of people would be
like okay let's go let's win this
tournament my will be like okay let's
try not to get
ninth so I'm always expecting like the
worst case scenario to happen it doesn't
affect how I play or anything about my
game it just helps me mentally deal with
the worst scenario when it does come so
you're basically hacking happiness
that's kind of what you're saying yeah
well in a in a way I guess so it doesn't
it doesn't work for a lot of people
because I've spoken about my Approach
with many of my colleagues and it
doesn't work for them they need this
motivation of oh yeah we're going to win
in order to play good I don't need that
so it works for
me yeah I I I can see this indeed go go
both ways Adam what what is your take on
this you know Miss Mr mindset
performance I'm sure you have some
thoughts on this
one well yeah I think if you can instill
this mindset it's a bit of a superpower
because it allows you to focus on
performance rather than outcome so
especially as tournaments get deep as
you go run deep in the tournaments it's
very easy to get excited about the big
payoffs the prize up top and all of a
sudden you're getting this excitement
about what you could win in reality is
like it's still a strategy game still
the same game so if you can just be okay
with the worst case scenario it allows
you to focus back in the moment and not
care too much about what's going to
happen so yeah I think it's quite a
unique skill set to be honest I haven't
had many tournament Players in
particular H Master the skill because
you guys generally get a little bit of
excitement for your big scores you can
win so but yeah I think it's definitely
a strong mindset if you can install
it then when you do win how how does do
you then go do you then do allow
yourself because like obviously it's
expectation to win that's kind of the
problem right because then you can maybe
not win but then when you do get first
or maybe second how does that then feel
right you can you can kind of let go of
that mindset you know you're now it's
really it's really the case you've won
do you then let it all out or how does
that work let it all out no I I wouldn't
say so I would say that I'm a pretty
humble winner as well so I'm obviously
happy when I win but I also recognize
that okay I won this tournament because
I run good and I could have lost that
flip and then gotten seventh or whatever
so yeah I don't think you will ever see
me like celebrate big time like you see
people on streams like you know jumping
around hitting the table whatnot because
it's just it's not like that for me it's
just all about the strategy so if I get
the strategy right then that's what I
care about sure winning money is great
obviously that's why I play the game but
yeah I don't think you're going to see
me jump around after we yeah you know
how it works right one tournament so
maybe if we zoom out further you know
and you look back over your career for
example something that you know we're
going to be discussing throughout this
podcast right your whole career if you
then zoom out and see the progress that
you make I guess it's more of a
long-term type of satisfaction feeling
or like PRI Pride yeah yeah yeah for
sure no I'm definitely satisfied and I
proud of what I've managed to achieve I
would say if you asked me a few years
ago where I thought I would be today it
would have been at a lower level than I
am so yeah I I'm definitely proud of
what I've achieved uh but without
turning into I guess obnoxious or
arrogant or bragging or
whatever that makes sense Adam um I was
wondering to to kind of go back like I
can I can think of let's say you're
number one and you have 10 players left
I I sat next to a guy once in a live
tournament where he was like I think we
were close to the bubble he had a very
good stack and he kept on saying like oh
the bubble is approaching you know
probably I'm going to Bubble you see I
hate bubbles blah blah blah basically he
kept on saying like like kind of what
Alex said I'm trying to not finish ninth
like obviously if it doesn't in affect
your play great but I saw this guy
obviously bubbled because he kept on
saying that how he unlucky he was and he
always bubbled and then he bubbled
uh you you you you see where I'm getting
at like I can see that saying that
you're going to win you know there's
like this positive psychology movement
where people like no you should you you
should you should say that you're going
to win you should believe that you're
going to win because then you're going
to play in a way that you're going to
win how how can that cross over if you
have the mentality more of like oh no I
want to be ninth I know it works for
Alex but is there also like a dark side
of the coin is I guess the question that
I'm trying to ask you well yeah I think
what really matters is are you focusing
on playing your best and is your mind
clear enough to make good decisions so
this guy you mentions I'm guessing he's
not playing great poker cuz all he's
thinking about is busting out bubbling
all that energy that could be spent on
the strategy picking up TS at the table
is now spent on the wrong things so I
think often when your expectations get
out of sync you get too excited is the
most common variety of this you lose
your attention on what you're doing and
I speak with a lot of MTT players who go
I played great until the final table and
I went what happened on the final table
I started looking at the cash up top and
I started getting excited a bit nervous
and that then relays into how you play
so your strategy is Downstream of that
kind of excited feeling that you have so
yeah it's a lot easier said than done
this is not a easy skill to go hm I
don't care if I finish ninth I'm okay
with it a million up top 100K for nth
I'm okay with 100K but I think it's a
really uh it's definitely better to be
more on that side than on the overe
excited side so yeah I definitely think
there's a a lot to be said about trying
to instill that I I try to tell players
a lot to how do you lower expectations
so if you look at like how kind of your
emotions play out expectations minus
reality the in between is pain so
expectations I'm going to win this
tournament and you come ninth those
eight spots in between you feel a lot of
pain you're like ah the next day you
crash you feel disappointed you feel
down about it so yeah I think as much as
possible why not focus on your
performance why don't just keep playing
the game so it reminds me there's a
concept called finite games and infinite
games so finite games you play to win so
if you're like the finite game is okay
Final Table let's win this tournament
this is it the infinite game is I play
just to keep playing I enjoy the game I
enjoy being here I want to play tomorrow
I want to play next day as long as I'm
here this is awesome so the mindset is
very different cuz you're just there to
play and often over the long term people
who play these infinite games even in a
final game of poker often do a lot
better see I think the the mindset there
is very clear in terms of what which one
wins I think Alex's mindset overall
especially for you Alex because like you
said you can tell the people this but
they can't just install the chip of I
don't care it's like a very thing you've
got to work through yourself but I do
think most players would should work on
low on expectations especially at final
tables for tournaments just so they can
play pressure free they can enjoy the
game and actually bring their best
performance
all right so Alex I'm really Keen to
dive into your story now and your
background from gaming and how that led
you into the successful poker career so
talk us through when you decided that
poker was going to be the game of choice
and talk us for those kind of initial
steps into the world of
Poker right sure so the way I started
poker is in my second year of University
maybe first I'm not sure I was invited
to a home game of poker by some friends
I didn't even know what poker was at
that point so I just read up on the
rules in like five minutes and then I
went and played so I found it
interesting entertaining or strateg game
card game what's not like and then a
couple of days later one of these
friends was like oh let's go buy a pay
safe card for 10 EUR and play online
poker like sure whatever so then we're
both sitting there completely clueless
and we end up winning a tournament for
like a thousand Euros or something which
at the time for a university student was
just this insane amount but I won in
like three hours like hold on a minute
there's actually money to be game
through the PO through the game I enjoy
so that's when I started looking more
and more into it and I saw that indeed
there are people making a lot of money
through poker so then I just decided to
devote myself to that and I spent like
three months just studying not playing
at all understanding you know P ODS the
basic Game Theory just learning what the
game is about and then I slowly started
playing I gave up on my DJing job back
then
and uh went poer fulltime after a few
months how did the uh impact of winning
and losing money affect you I'm guessing
the other games you played didn't have
that variable of winning and losing and
as you said when you're a broke student
which I can relate to starting out
everything feels big it's like oh like
this could be a a meal for me this could
be a night out with friends how are you
relating in the early days to uh the
money aspect of the game you playing
yeah the first few months were pretty
tough because yeah as you said broke
student so I had to sacrifice quite a
few things I had to sacrifice no meals
or going out or whatever in order to
keep money to play the $2 pocket
tournament on poker stars or whatever it
was so that was definitely a concern at
the beginning but then once I started
building up a bankroll and I realized
bankr management then things go quite a
bit easier so I would say once you get
your first like couple of thousand that
you can spend in poker then Things
become a bit easier for the Mone aspect
at least for me
how long did it take you to get to that
initial 2000 and then what were the
goals at that point when you got that
first kind of comfort point what were
you aiming for at the start yeah um so
as I said after that random ,000 win
that we split with my friend then I
spent just three months studying and
then I guess in the next two months or
so I was able to make my first couple of
thousand back then it was what way
easier because the tournaments were just
much much bigger for example Poker Stars
would have like 10 tournaments below $5
every day each giving like 3,000 please
St up so you could make a lot of money
through just one random tournament win
which isn't really possible nowadays I
think at which point did you start to
think wait a second this maybe just some
SED come maybe I can like go fulltime
and make this my career when was I kind
of shift towards a serious approach to
Poker well I would say pretty much right
away once I won that first amount of
money and then I researched and saw that
there are people making serious money
through poker I said Okay I I can see I
can see this being my job so then I
spend this three months only studying
and then just straight away just as I
got into playing after studying I was
like yeah this is this this can work
this can definitely
work you mentioned that you had good
bankroll management approaches talk us
through what bankr management looked
like for you in those early days and how
you were using some precaution to avoid
big downswings yeah so back then there
was some book I I I can't remember the
name yeah cuz that day you had to read
books that was the way to study poker
you didn't have that many online tools
as you do now so you had to read like
The some some guy called like super
whale or whale something had a pretty
good book anyway I don't remember what
but there was some book about bankroll
management and saying how many binds you
would need based on how tough the fields
are and so on so I used that but I'm a
bit blank on the details right now but
right now we have way better formulas to
calculate variance in back management uh
like Prime dope or whatever the site is
called and some other
sites do you have some loose guidelines
rules of thumb that the audience could
take away in terms of how to think about
bank or management for mtts or is there
not too many variables to uh to simplify
like that so some things to keep in mind
when deciding has to be of course how
tough the tournament is but then also
one very misunderstood part is how many
Runners the tournament has the less
amount of people that play the
tournament the less money you need to
play it because you're just going to win
more often if I play a SE and go I'm
going to win one out of nine times so I
don't need to have that much money to
play the tournament whereas if I play
the Sunday million which has I don't
know 5,000 Runners 10,000 whatever it
has well my bankroll requirement will be
pretty high for that because I'm just
going to lose very very
often so I think this is a very
misunderstood aspect of bankr management
how many people play the tournament of
course the more people that play it
usually the softer it would be but still
there's always a sweet a sweet spot
where yeah we just need a lot more money
to play the big
tournaments uh how does it also affect
your mindset when you're playing like
the Deep Field tournaments a lot let's
say your schedule's mainly big Runner
tournaments obviously you're going to go
on Long streaks of not winning have you
ever had that kind of grind where you
haven't had any lower fields and you've
had longer streaks of not winning and
how is that to deal with on it from a
mindset
perspective yeah yeah for sure for sure
I've had that uh not anymore now because
now I play mostly smaller FS but through
my career most of my time I've been
playing Big Field tournaments and
exactly as you said because of the high
variance there you can just be losing
constantly for very long periods of time
I mean beating a field of 2,000 people
is just really tough to do you're not
going to do it very often and again this
just comes back to realizing variant and
realizing that you may be doing
everything right but you're still going
to lose because that's how the game
works yeah so for you it seems quite
simple that you don't really buy into
variance too much you're aware of its
role you're aware how it plays into like
the the kind of win and loss in but like
sometimes day to day month to month it
can feel very challenging to like just
keep showing up when you're not winning
so you mentioned for you the most
important variable is playing well so
for you how do you define that you're
playing well because I think a lot of
players struggle with this because when
they're winning it's easy it's like I'm
winning things are going well but let's
say you're losing for a prolonged period
of time maybe haven't got the trip BV to
kind of back it up and it's really hard
to know like am I playing well am I
deluding myself is this variance or have
I crossed over to uh to being a bad
poker player so how do you kind of
Define playing well and what are the
things you look for to make sure you're
playing well during bad patches MH so
this has just to do with the detaching
yourself from the emotions of the game
like whether you win or lose doesn't
really come down to you in terms of a
short period of time so just going
through your hands and studying and
studying and studying and being
objective and also getting opinion from
other people that also helps having a
good study group around you of people
who are at your level or at a higher
level and who will be honest with you
definitely helps but I would say the
number one thing is to just try and be
honest with yourself and just review and
study a lot your routine shouldn't
change if you win or lose you should
study the same and do the same things
winning doesn't mean you play better and
losing doesn't me you're playing worse
than you did a year ago for
example great advice so you build your
bank roll to a few thousand You' got a
bit of comfort you're enjoying the game
talk us through the kind of next
progression for you first of all what
were your expectations then you've
already decided that okay wait a second
this could be my full-time thing talk us
through like how you were aligning your
goals expectations of Poker and how you
were kind of progressing at this stage
sure so after maybe a year or a couple
of years of playing I was moving up and
building up my bank roll and playing
higher and higher but I had this feeling
that I wasn't winning as much as I
should be winning because I thought I
was playing better than my results were
indicating so I moved a bit higher and
that didn't go well and that was when I
went through my first very big downswing
during some series I think it was 2017
maybe something like that I'm not
exactly sure on the year I ended up
losing like half my bankroll during one
of the big series events um so during
school yeah that was pretty painful of
course and then that was also a bit of a
reality check like okay maybe you're not
right maybe you think you're playing
better than you are so that's when I
decided to look for
coaching and get a second opinion of
someone that is crushing my stakes and
crushing higher stakes and maybe they
can tell me what they think of my play
and funnny enough the person I chose to
coach me back then was Jans gra who you
had on the podcast the while
ago and yeah having a session with him
was very eye openening because I just
found out so many things I was doing
wrong but I had no idea about finding
out your leaks back then was way harder
than it is now there is so much free
material now on the internet but and so
many like live streams and whatnot but
if you're doing something wrong chances
are you're going to figure it out
someone is going to do something
different and you're going to figure it
out back then it was way harder and
coaching was one of the only ways for
someone to tell you that yeah you're
doing this wrong so I would say that was
extremely eye opening for me and after
coaching with graphel I decided to join
bit which was a stable back then uh with
really high level
coaches and I think that was like the
big jump in my career the moment where I
went from playing and doing fine in mid
Stakes to moving up in high stakes and
doing very well
there what do you think led to that big
jump was it being around good players
getting their inputs hearing their
thoughts them your game and giving you
insights what were some of the big
things that you felt for you personally
allowed you to make that jump being part
of a a good coaching
group upon joining BP you had to sign a
contract which said that you were
committed to them for 18 months one and
a half year and this is a really big
commitment to share half of your profits
for one and a half year with someone so
I decided that if I was to accept this
Ste and join the stable I would make the
absolute maximum I could out of it I
would watch every single video I would
like drain every piece of information
they had available for me uh back then
vby had many great coaches it had Romeo
Pro it had graph of course it had a San
beny be it had oota just so so many
great players apotheosis just amazing
players and they would all do weekly or
monthly sessions and there was a big
video library so I would spend hours
upon hours of watching everything every
little thing I could and just yeah like
a spawn just absorb everything I could
and another thing that I think helped me
is that I've always been pretty
competitive in my in my nature so upon
joining the B I would of course play the
lowest Stakes they offered because I was
just BR new and I would look at their
roster and be like H I have this guy
tagged as a fish why is he playing
higher Stakes than me or oh this guy I
know he's a bad rig why is he like in
tier one why is he playing the highest
games so this would just give me a lot
of motivation to prove that I'm better
than them to become better than them and
move above them which it's a bit toxic
maybe but it's just
motivation whatever activates you to get
going I think is good fuel I think
sometimes we can glorify motivated
motivations I think competition is a
great motive to want to better yourself
beat other people in a competitive
environment po a competitive field to
see your opponents even peers as Rivals
that you want to beat I think it's a
healthy thing so yeah talk us through
like the kind of climbs you made so
before join a bit B what kind of what
was your average Buy in and talk through
the levels You Are Climbing and what are
the main kind of jumps for MTT players
what are the main kind of criteria where
you going I'm progressing into next
level of BU or games game strength what
are some of the the big ones that come
to
mind so before joining bitp I used to
play average Buy in around 100 maybe
something like that and then when I
joined I had to move down to maybe 60 or
something because that was the lowest
year when you joined the stable and I
remember I was actually a bit upset by
that I wanted to play some games that I
played on my own but they would
um allow me to play and there was a bit
of uh I guess conflict in the beginning
where I was trying to convince them to
let me play higher and they said not yet
in a while so yeah I dropped to about
half my uh average buying for a while
but thankfully quickly I was able to
prove I was better than they thought and
I uh moved up to playing higher again
now as for any big immediate jumps I
think it was just the process it wasn't
like oh now I won this tournament so I
can play that it was after every few
months they were reviewing their horses
and they were deciding who gets to play
which tournaments and what level you
were at so I was just constantly on the
rise moving
up um yeah I don't think there was one
like specific moment where oh from now
on I can play
higher yeah it's that progression just
every day chipping away learning
studying getting a bit better where when
you look back in a year's time of doing
that every day you're like oh I've come
quite far it wasn't like a big jump but
every day was like a a step towards that
so you mentioned in the questionnaire we
sent to you that discipline and hard
work is what sets you apart and even
this conversation so far I'm getting
this kind of strong worth ethic trying
to outwork people but also dedicated to
your craft so yeah talk us through like
what discipline hardw looks like for you
in terms of the early days of Poker or
this this progression periods to us for
like how how your days were structured
and how do you feel like you were either
working harder or more disciplined in
the
competition yeah um a lot to talk about
here so first about discipline one part
of discipline is also that I've never
had gambling tendencies in any way even
maybe bit funny coming from a poker
player but outside of Poker I I've never
gambled anything and even in poker I
don't have any gambling Tendencies at
all it's all it's all just Theory GTO or
play as good as you can the result
doesn't matter like nothing no emotional
attachment as I said before uh it's just
my job where I have to click the correct
button that's that's it that's poker for
me as for working hard yeah it all came
from utilizing every moment in bit B
because of how much I had to give up to
join them and then after that it became
sort of routine I guess where it's
unacceptable to me to have a spot I'm
not sure of and not run it not find out
the answer figuring out the answer is
the fan of Poker for me like solving the
puzzle and yeah figuring out the
strategy that's what I really enjoy
about
poker excuse me now as for outworking
others I think a lot of other people
that I've spoken to have trouble
committing long hours into studying they
need have like this very uh strict
program of okay now I'm gonna study two
hours then I'm gonna do this for one
hour then I'm gonna play for five hours
and that's not how I work let's say
today I'm going to study uh poos or
whatever or some three-way scenario I
don't know I'm G to study for 10 hours
if I have to until I've reached my goal
until I've achieved what I want to
achieve so it's not so much oh I'm going
to study two hours it's today I'm going
to study this topic however long it
takes what allows you to have that
mental endurance to put in these bigger
sessions because as you mentioned a lot
of players will do these shorter study
sessions one hour two hours they will
feel quite drained after it and they'll
maybe take a break do the grind
separately but most players would
struggle to replicate that kind of I'm
going to do a full day of studying this
thing till I get the ancest so what do
you think allows you to spend so much
time on your study
topics I think a few things first of all
of course me enjoying the actual
strategy aspect of the game like
figuring out the strategies is like a
big ah H moment for me I feel good then
I feel good learning new sports and when
it comes to execution knowing what I
should do in this sport it's just yeah
really big source of I guess
satisfaction for me um then also it has
to do with determination I guess wanting
to achieve your goals wanting to get to
where you want to go you have to go
through the hopes you have to spend the
time I would say these the two main
reasons you structure your days if
you're somebody who uh is able to study
for very long periods I'm sure there's
times where you can just get lost in
studying and maybe not get your grinding
hours in so talk us through how you're
able to be consistent with your grinding
and also like make time blocks for
studying I'm wondering for you how this
works in terms of your daily structure
or weekly structure where do you study
and when do you fit time for grinding if
you're able to kind of go very long
periods for both of those MH yeah that's
uh that's interesting so I'm generally
not the type of person that structures
their day I don't have like a schedule
for the day oh now I'm going to do this
then I'm going to do that then I'm going
to do that obviously if I have something
set up like today I have the podcast or
tomorrow I'm gonna have a coaching
session obviously that has to be
scheduled but in general I avoid setting
like time schedules time zones for each
day uh as for sorting out my grinding
and my playing right now it comes a lot
in periods so you have the months where
you are grinding nonstop and then you
have the months where there's not much
to play so you spend it mostly by
studying another thing that I'm almost
always doing is I don't combine studying
and grinding
days so for example I'm going to be
grinding on let's say Sunday Thursday
and Tuesday and then the rest of the
days I'm going to be studying or
coaching or doing whatever um not going
to have a day where oh I wake up then I
study three hours and then I play
because I found that for me starting
before playing Just exhausts me I want
to jump into the session fresh without
having worked already
beforehand that makes a lot of sense
yeah that that kind of clarifies for me
how you're able to uh do these kind of
marathon study sessions without wor
worrying about when you're going to
grind because yeah as you said you
separate the days so it's a study day
it's like okay I can go as long as I
need to to get the answers because this
is the nature of the day and then on
your grinding days there's little or no
study in so again you can put all your
energy into that um for you how do you
avoid let's say burnout in terms of if
you're able to if you're so interested
so I'm guessing you're you you love
solving problems you get really into
studying and even grinding talk us
through like how you get balance in your
kind of days and weeks to avoid burning
out because it's very U tempting to
overdo stuff to put long sessions in a
grinding and study in I'm sure around
series as well when there's big
tournament demands going on how do you
avoid burnout or do you have any
challenges
there until recently I've never really
had issues with h feeling burnt out
because maybe it goes back to gaming but
playing for like I don't know 10 hours a
day that was normal for me when I was
playing video games and that's normal
for me when I'm playing poker so I don't
feel tired or bented out through that
it's just a day routine for me uh
recently though in the past series uh
which was scoop I actually felt burnt
out for the first time tog had this
leaderboard thing where I somehow ended
up competing in because I was like it
run good at the beginning and it was a
really big leaderboard so D was
definitely worth spending more time into
it so I ended up grinding every single
day for like 30 five days in a row
without taking a single day off and
what's even more I guess exhausting on
top of that is that g had the first
tournament starting in the afternoon at
like 300 p.m. and the last tournament
starting at 3:00 a.m. so no matter how
bad your session went you had to spend
at least 12 hours
playing so this was the first time that
I actually felt really burnt out because
it was just extremely long hours for a
super long time and yeah I decided I'm
just not really going to go for these
gter boards anymore even if play is very
high because it just it doesn't really
please me to force myself to play but
other than that I haven't really
experienced burnout in my career only
now which was I guess forced in a way
upon me yeah I'm guessing that's not
your normal approach to grinding you you
only play when you want to uh it sounds
like you're someone who loves studying
which probably like recharges you in
between your grind ERS and if you was
like put all your hours in this to grind
in this 35 days in a row which sounds
pretty intense I can imagine that's a
very different approach to a your usual
kind more balanced approach to to Poker
so you mentioned you mentioned in the
conversation and in the the question
there that I view poker simply as my job
no ego no feelings no gambling
Tendencies just looking for the highest
AV strategies I thought this was really
powerful in terms of a strong mindset to
instill but also very hard to get to
this point so for you you mentioned
we'll start with no ego talk us for like
as an MTT player you get you guys get a
lot of prayers for winning you guys get
a lot of peer reviews as being good
players you get the big prizes this the
trophies tell me for like how you have
avoided building an ego around winning
especially when you're competitive you
mentioned you like beating people how do
you how do you feel like you've kept the
ego at Bay so to speak throughout this
Pursuit yeah that's not very easy for me
to point out maybe just a character
trait of mine um but sure I am happy and
I am proud when I win and of my
achievements but at the same time I
don't yeah I haven't built up any ego at
all but what I meant more in that
comment about keeping my ego at pay is
that I'm never going to think like oh
this guy is owning me oh this guy is
after me oh now I'm going to go after
this guy or oh how does this guy win
he's so bad stuff like that this is more
what I meant in terms of ego like I've
completely abolished that I don't have
this kind of emotional attachment to
anything when it comes to Poker all I
think about is how should I play I just
do not care about all the other all the
other
aspects have you ever had to struggle
with emotions as the B player oh for
sure for sure it it wasn't such an easy
ride I think like most players when you
first get into tournaments all this
things start annoying you you're annoyed
by running bad you're annoyed by losing
money you're annoyed by someone you know
who you don't think is good winning more
money than you um you're annoyed by oh
this guy's three betting me all the time
he must think I'm weak now I'm gonna
prove him wrong or whatever thought
process and slowly I think you just get
over these things by playing more and
more and just understanding how the game
works you just completely move over
these
things wasn't from day one that oh yeah
I just come here yeah so you you were
experiencing the normal human emotions
I'm just checking that you've uh you've
got the pulse there things are things
are working that's good but you
mentioned that you just go past them and
I feel like for you that might be true
but a lot of players don't just move
past them they keep these emotions they
keep these bitter feelings labeling
opponents feeling that frustration when
things aren't going their way so for you
can remember the time when you noticed
that you weren't experience much
emotions what do you think were the kind
of the Clicks in your mind or
subconsciously that allowed you to stop
um seeing things personally to allow
yourself to experience less emotions
what were some of the main things that
come to mind there it was an overtime
process where I just realized it's not
productive it doesn't lead to anything
positive it would only make me feel
worse and make me more upset more Angry
whatever it may be so when when you are
experiencing emotions that AR product
told you just need to work into
abolishing them and just not
experiencing them anymore um and again
it
was a process went over time it's not
that from one day to another it was like
ha I shouldn't get upset anymore now I'm
not upset no it of course wasn't like
that uh but yeah gradually over time it
started bother me less and less and less
and to this point I think my just it
just doesn't bother me almost at
all yeah I think by now sorry I don't
have any specific words of wisdom to
provide it's just yeah
a gradual process that for me no that's
good I've obviously put a lot of hours
in to your craft and sometimes along
that Journey things just started piec
together and it might not be like a
pivotal thing that happens in terms of
oh I changed this and then that unlocked
this next chapter sometimes it just like
all right I just got exposure to the
stimulus I realized it wasn't helping me
and I found a way to over time get more
and more desensitized to what was
happening so for you it sounds like it
was more the L there now I'm curious to
know about your relationship to risk and
gambling so you mentioned No gambling
tendency so the first question that pops
off my head is What attracted you to
tournaments when you don't have this
kind of gambling tendency and then how
do you think about risk in terms of how
much risk you're willing to take or when
you have opportunities I'm sure in your
world right now there's a lots of
opportunities of Tor you can play
whether it's live online different range
of buyin that you can choose to take on
more risk for certain series for example
how do you think about risk and how do
you what do what do you think about when
you're trying to make decisions yeah so
first about What attracted me to
tournament poker
well the truth is it just happened to be
the part of Poker that I started playing
because that's what my friends played
when they introduced me to the game so
then I started playing tournaments I
studed tournaments and I became good at
tournaments and there's no no easy
answer to that should I have switch the
couch games at some point maybe but
every time I thought about switching I
thought I was already way too deep into
tournaments to just give up all but
knowledge and start playing another game
because comparing tournaments to cash
games there are much many different
things I guess you need to know for each
of the two games cash games just 100 big
lines tournaments you kind of never play
100 big
lines so yeah I guess it's not that I
specifically chose tournaments for a
reason I just happen to start playing
tournaments and I stuck with them ever
since now as for taking risk I would say
I'm generally not a very big risk taker
um I always just use the brm formula to
decide how much should keep up my action
how big should I play and things like
that I will very rarely take a shot and
keep more than I should maybe on some
random main event but it's not something
I do very often I want to be careful and
precise with how I spend my money and
how much risk I
take do you pred decide before a series
in advance what sort of TS you're going
to be playing and then you decide what
kind of risk you're willing to take on
and does that deviate from like series
to series do you like as had a good
series do you up your can average Buy in
so to speak or do you keep it somewhat
static for long periods uh depends on
bitcoin price
no
um I usually do decide before the series
exactly what my schedule will look like
and I don't really change it unless I
don't know I happen to win 10
tournaments and then I will have more
money so then I will be able to keep a
higher action of myself and buy back
some pieces or whatever but yeah I
always decide beforehand and I don't let
like my feelings of the Day affect how
I'm going to play just the schedule I
have and what I should do and uh in
terms of changing how much or how high I
play between series again I would say it
just depends on how my bank roll is
looking like how I did the previous
series actually how crypto is doing
which because I have a fairly big
allocation there I said it as a joke but
it is it is a consideration so yeah
again just depends on how I'm doing
financially how do you deal with making
mistakes so you mentioned you're someone
who just looks for the highest AV
strategies great when that's working
well and you're playing good pocker but
when you're not playing well or mistakes
are creeping in how do you generally uh
deal with those what are some of the
kind of things you either tag the hands
go for study sessions or even on an
emotional level how do you generally
process
mistakes I think it's a very interesting
topic so I generally am quite harsh on
myself with mistakes but I tend to rank
them in terms of whether a mistake is
acceptable or not for example uh let's
say you jump seven do softs Under the
Gun well that's something you should
know better you shouldn't do so then
where do you draw a line of a mistake
that you should know better obviously
let's say I call a jam one pep to wide
well that's fine it's an acceptable
mistake you're not going to know every
ICM spot perfectly sure but then what if
you call two peps to wide or three PS to
wide where do you draw a line where
you're like no you should have known
better like it's your job you need to be
better than that and it's the latter
type of mistakes like the mistakes that
I should have known better which bother
me the most because they're mistakes
that even studying them doesn't matter
too much because it's such a big mistake
that you should just have known better
by
now and uh yeah I tend to be quite
strict on myself when I make mistakes uh
it's the number one thing I guess that
annoys me in poker is when I make a
mistake that I shouldn't have made of
course it happens and you get over it
but my Approach with mistakes is quite a
bit different than some other people
You' had like Sam for example who ven
who went to accepting just mistakes and
being like yeah oh well leave and learn
yeah I'm not like that I'm way more
harsh and critical of my mistakes and
dive a lot more deeper into why did it
happen how can I prevent it from
happening again and just starting the
sport in much more detail yeah I was
wondering where it goes into like the
practical application of learning from
that mistake I always find it
interesting when people say like I
should I shouldn't have made that I
should know better because like the fact
you've made the mistake kind of implies
that you didn't know better and it's
like a judgment that I shouldn't have
this in my game because I said so
because I've done enough work on this
and it shouldn't be there so for you
like you mentioned you're a bit critical
on yourself and you use that kind of
energy to uh go deeper on the spot
understand it better so let's say you
make a mistake it's a big one and you
your mind labels I shouldn't have done
that that was a bad mistake talk us
through like the the process you go
through when you're bit annoyed at
yourself to make sure that mistake
doesn't happen again do you go deep into
solvers how do you uh learn that learn
that lesson so it doesn't happen
again so first of all I have to figure
out why I made the mistake is it a
mistake that I knew and just failed to
execute or is it indeed something that
even upon reviewing I was like yeah I
didn't know that was the correct play
and depending on which of the two
factors caused me to make the mistake I
will approach it differently if I knew
the mistake like I knew how I should
play but ended up making a mistake
anyway then I just need to dive into why
did I not have the correct thought
process why did I skip a thinking step
was I playing too many tables was I
tired was I distracted by something
doing something else just really trying
to nail down why it happened and making
sure it just does not happen ever
again this kind could be for example a
misclick in a live tournament or
something like that which is something
you should know better but then because
you were distracted or missed something
you ended up making a big mistake sorry
what you were going to say yeah I was
just going to say for you what are some
of the most common reasons why you end
up making mistakes that you let say you
know the strategy in the spot but you've
looked back and when that was a mistake
because I didn't execute in real time
unless say was you were tired or you
were distracted how do you then prevent
that happening again because I think a
lot of players struggle with this where
they almost get in this like repetitive
cycle where they're like I should know
better but I didn't then they make the
mistake again and go well I should know
better this time and almost this a cycle
of like they should know better but they
don't so how do you um kind of instill
in your mind or learn the lesson
valuably so like next time you you're in
that situation the the ratio of that
mistake or probability mistake goes down
next
time I think it just comes down to as I
said having very high standards of
myself and being very strict with myself
so upon sporting a mistake like that
that I should not have made I just
really try to how do I say it exactly
just like really convince myself really
solidify inside me why it happen and
making sure take every measure it
doesn't happen again let's say that um I
timed out on a table because I was
looking at my phone random example right
I'm not saying it happens of course it
doesn't but just a random example well
then I'm never going to have my phone on
the table ever again in my life when I
play hoger so it just has to be like
really drastic measures once a mistake
happens that shouldn't have happened to
never allow it to happen again uh for
example in the latest Trion that I
played um just a bit of a story time I
was pretty deep in a tournament we were
maybe 30 people left something like that
uh we were in the money at that point so
just really deep in the
tournament and some short stack goes all
in from middle position I think it's
folded to me in position one to the left
of the dealer so I declare I'm all in
but then the person to the right of the
dealer position eight he has cards I
didn't see it because the dealer is in
between and then he ended up having a
hand that busted me so anyway I lost
there and this was a mistake that should
not have happened I should be aware that
the person to the right of the dealer
still has cards so what I've done now
besides of course pay much more
attention to the table is every time
there is like some sort of significant
action before me and it's my turn to act
I always ask like has the other position
folded but I cannot see and it is
annoying but it's just a process that I
have to go through to make sure this
mistake never ever happens again I'm
just going to be like a th% sure every
time that the person I cannot see has
holded just as an example so this is
yeah the first type of mistake and then
we go to the
mistake where it's a big mistake but I
didn't know any better about it and
that's just a signal that you need to
study this spot in much more detail and
then I'm going to spend as many hours as
it takes to just familiarize myself a
lot more with the
spot yes it's this very high standard
you've got there where the mistake
becomes a very big signal to go right I
need to learn from this this can't
happen again either I need to learn the
strategy to get better or a lot of times
I need to execute my strategy better and
I need to take every measure I can to
make sure this has been a valuable
learning experience so yeah I think for
you it's you must learn very quickly
because I think a lot of players one of
the frustrations I I he players really
to me is they're making these mistakes
that they should know better but then
they keep coming up it's like been weeks
and months and that this mistakes still
creeping into their game and they've
kind of lost confidence that they're
going to be able to eradicate it but for
you because you've got this kind of
frustration with yourself but also very
high standards you're like this is never
happened again if it happens once I'm
going to learn this lesson and I will
make sure I don't repeat this mistake so
I'm guessing for you even though it's
painful you gain a lot of confidence in
yourself over time that you're going to
find these mistakes you're going to
eradicate them and you're going to be
leveling up for all for all your
sessions you play yeah yeah exactly and
I've turned this like strictness with
myself into something positive I think
to just make sure I don't repeat the
same
mistakes there's a donkey and a shark on
the wall behind you do they represent
anything to you they are um yeah it
represents my two sides playing F no um
in truth I just found it I saw them in a
shop and I thought they would be fun
additions to my office because of what
they represent in poker but um in a more
I guess poetic way it's I have this as a
background for when I'm doing coaching
and so on because you can turn from the
donkey where is it there it is to to the
shark and yeah it's just I think a nice
little addition to a
room I like it I think it fits well like
you said it's one of those any situation
in life but in poker particular you can
be the donkey or the shock and switch
between the to very quickly and yeah the
donkey got a lot to learn the shark's
got a got a lot to kind of take
advantage of but yeah I think it's a
good little reminder there it's a little
playful thing to have on the wall remind
that the distance between them isn't
that big but going from D to sh right
it's not that's deep we're going
deep yeah yeah you've thought about this
you've this not just a tie on the wall
there a there's a hidden meaning here I
thought there might be I think
because KN you have some the wall it
starts with one thing and then over time
you start to create a a narrative around
it that makes it more more powerful for
you as you seeing it every day so yeah
interesting all right Ren for you how do
you process mistakes these days I know
you don't play as much right now so I'm
guessing it's more challenging for you
when you do make mistakes maybe having
to accept that you're not going to put
as much time into uh to working on them
so how do you process mistakes and try
to learn from them the same way Alex
does yeah I'm definitely more in the I I
was in the Alex Camp before but for me
personally that didn't really work also
I feel like it's um it's an endless
cycle because you always make
mistakes because what you now maybe not
see as a mistake in the future when you
improve as a player is a mistake so I
came to at some point just realize
listen mistakes is just going to be part
of it I do obviously make note and be
like hey interesting I made this mistake
what can I do to improve but especially
in the moment itself I might identify oh
yeah I have more tables than I normally
play therefore I now made a mistake that
I should not make but I'm a bit more in
your camp but you're said should not
make well I did make them so I should
probably expect to make them so it's
mainly my expectation that I should
align instead of like my my realistic
view of myself and how much I'm capable
of playing this game in this specific
moment right I don't know how many
tables at open I don't know how how much
I slept I don't know how much bad beats
I got I don't know how much you
understand like I don't know how
frustrated I was at that moment there's
so much variables that I found it more
useful to take a more compassionate
route and be like I made this mistake
the first thing obviously it's more like
the ego side that's like I shouldn't be
making this you should be better than
that but I can quickly kind of overturn
it well apparently not and then off game
try to feel feel like okay what can I
what what can I do about I feel like my
offg game process is very similar to
Alex but in game I've not found it very
useful to be too critical of myself in
order to because it would influence how
I play and I feel like a lot of things
that Alex has been explaining so far it
doesn't really influence his decisions
in a hand next to this hand but for me
if I start to get frustrated about a
mistake that I should not be making it
definitely influences the way I play the
next end so for me the compassion rout
is needed because else I will just screw
up uh my session for example I try to I
always had like this in my primer I
would try to come up with the response
that would would allow me to continue my
session in a high evv way as possible
and for me that's not being critical
myself does for you it it doesn't
influence I assume how you play the rest
of your session right Alex from what I'm
hearing so far if anything I think it
helps me play better let say I make a
big mistake I'm gonna be like yeah let's
not be stupid from now on like focus
more play better do better this was not
a mistake we should have made so let's
not make any more mistakes like that so
yeah if anything to me it's it helps me
do better the my session instead of
pushing me the other way well that's
very interesting but but I definitely
agree for example if I made a mistake
because I was talking to some guy on
Discord while I was playing yeah I
should I should probably not do that
right so I that's something actively
that I can remove or you know I was just
being tired because the night before I
went to bed way too late even though I
know I was going to play and I drank too
much beer blah blah blah you know these
are all things that I can cut out easy
easy fixes but then at some point I feel
like there's just mistakes left because
you know there was a huge will in the
game and therefore I continued playing
longer than I normally do well okay then
I kind of align expectations well I'm
playing longer now or I'm playing more
tables because the circumstances they
kind of asked for it let's you know I'm
going to make for example I played in uh
in Vegas a couple weeks ago and I play
live poker what once a year chances are
I'm GNA make mistakes I'm gonna misread
chips I'm gonna throw in the wrong chips
sometime actually that did no I don't
think I threw in any wrong chips this
trip so that's good but for example I
accidentally almost mucked the winner
you know these are kind of things that
that kind of are for for me you know
also I don't take it too serious I'm
just there you know two weeks once a
year that's that's kind of the life
poker that I play like I I'm not going
to make too too I'm not going to be too
hard on myself in in that uh in in that
environment I was wondering how do you
go about like you've identified a leak
that's strategical you Meed okay well
then I have to fix it how does the
process of identifying your leaks and
fixing your leaks look like for you
MH the most important thing for me is to
try to get the general picture and not
look into this very specific hand in
question so let's say for example I
ended up uh jamming too wide on the bton
or something I'm not just going to look
at this specific sport I'm just going to
look in the overall Strate strategy of
uh the ICM surrounding the Bon how wide
should I Jam in every spot what factors
lead me to that and just try to get as
the general picture not the specific
spot whether that is through running
scripts for many different board
textures or simulating many similar
scenarios my number one focus is just
understand the reason why and not the
specific spot and I think this is very
very important because you're almost
never going to get the exact same spot
twice in poker it's going to be
extremely rare but you're going to have
the exact same position same stack size
same board same everything so
understanding singular ones
understanding the concept behind it and
why you made your mistake in general is
going to be way more productive than
just solving this specific
scenario do you may have a a recent
example that you can share with our
audience a recent example um one that
stands out to you sure sure sure so it
was maybe about a year ago or something
it's just the one I remember maybe not
too recent but um and I was playing
online against someone that I respect a
lot and it was an ICM situation we were
maybe final to table something like that
and anyway he defends the small blind
and then he leads out on a flop that I
thought there was no leading and then I
ended up misplaying against that lead so
when I saw it I was like what the hell
is this why does he get to lead on this
board and then I ran the spot and I see
that yeah no he's actually supposed to
have a lot of leads here so then I
identified an area of the game that I
didn't that I wasn't familiar with so
what I did is I ran maybe 50 different
scripts of different ICM scenarios and
like hundreds of flops for each scenario
and try to find out exactly when does
the SM line get to have a lead which
boards is it exactly what need to be the
parameters of the stacks and the RIS
premum levels and just yeah try to
understand the whole game tree and why
it
happens so that then basically the next
time and and you can now incorporate
that right that's that's something
that's useful and when someone I guess
also when someone does not lead a board
that he's supposed to Lead You Now
understand so when he doesn't lead you
can check back a bit more and when they
do lead you now don't go bananas because
I assume you went bananas and therefore
therefore you learned the lesson yeah
exactly exactly but this was a mistake
that I think is acceptable because it's
a unique situation or new situation that
I don't really know I haven't really
studied so I'm okay making these
mistakes and I'm just going to study the
spot and get better it's not in the
unacceptable you should be better than
that
category next to uh identifying mistakes
in game do you have any like offg game
processes of analyzing your stats on a
on a regular basis to see if you're
doing something too frequently or not
frequent
enough uh in terms of uh stats and
databases stuff like that I do it but it
is a bit more complicated nowadays
because you have all the pikos and
mystery bounties which will affect your
stats like you're going to have to limp
more or you're going to have to play
tighter play wi whatever it is and then
you also have like GG where you have to
convert the hand histories and some
hands get lost it it's not very clear
exactly what's going on with stats what
I do instead is I record pretty much
every session I played for the past year
or so and then I go over the recording
so that way I can pick up on I guess
some conscious mistakes I'm making like
if maybe I'm over folding the big line
or I'm not opening some bottom hand on
the Buton or whatever it may be or I'm
not randomizing a three bet spot
whatever it is I can look at that
through the recording
this has been very beneficial for me I
have maybe hundreds of sessions recorded
by
now yeah like it's definitely different
in cach games where the where the game
is way more static so analyzing
databases and looking at frequencies is
going to be way more handy where like a
frequency is going to change so much
based on the stack size your stack stack
size at the table ICM Etc that it's must
be a
very difficult way to analyze you
mentioned the uh pko's I mean I you have
to help me out you have pko psk Kos uh
what I I feel like you you you
specialize a bit more in this area what
are like some common mistakes you see or
maybe we should start at what were like
some mistakes that you in the beginning
made when these type of tournaments got
introduced and what are like common
mistakes you see players make when
joining like The Knockout tournaments
what's kind of the the main strategical
adjustments that people should take in
consideration MH right so pikos or
Progressive knockout tournaments is the
format where you start with a bounty on
your head and then every time you knock
someone out you pocket half his Bounty
but the other half goes on your head so
the person that's going to pass you next
is going to take more money than you
took from the person you passed before
and indeed this is a bit of a specialty
of mine I even have a course out on that
and it I always was attracted to P from
the first moment they came out because I
thought it was a new poker format that
not a lot of people knew knew about
whereas in the traditional tournaments
when I started moving up people were
already where I was before whereas pyos
was like even in the Playfield right
because it's a new format no one knows
about it so now I can be the best or
among the best without needing prior
experience or having to build up to
it um the most common
mistakes H they are quite a few so I
would say most of them derive from
people not uh accurately turning Bounty
into big blinds and understanding each
value once you understand how much a
bounty is worth in terms of big blinds
then you can adjust your strategy
accordingly because if a bound is worth
let's say half a person stack then that
is extremely important you really need
to go after that whereas if a bound is
worth 10% of their stack well doesn't
matter too
much and seeing or realizing how much
this is worth in blinds instead of just
monetary value is I think really really
important and can help solve a lot of
mistakes
so you have to make the conversion he
had it sounds a bit like for example in
in cash games uh in live cash games but
actually nowadays also online May some
apps and stuff you have stand up game I
don't know if you ever heard about that
but basically everyone has to stand up
and when you win you get to sit down and
the last person standing he has to give
everyone I don't know a couple big
blinds you know that's kind of similar
like especially when you're like two
left or three left it's like well for
example in in uh in in in Vegas a couple
weeks ago we were then playing 10 20 40
there's 100 B Bounty so if there's only
two left basically if I now get to sit
down I don't have to pay 800 so yes
there's 10240 but not really 102040
because there's sort of like an EV of
extra 300 in the in the pot that's kind
of what I have to take in
consideration yeah no I understand yeah
it's it seems some somewhat similar to
that for sure yeah but but then in in a
in a in a in a knockout tournament it's
the same for everyone like what makes it
interesting in send up game because if
you're sitting you're already SE it down
the other guy is still sending up you're
playing with unequal pot so I'm playing
for a way bigger pot than you're
actually playing for because you're
already sitting down so therefore for
example I can bet 3x the pot and for me
that's like equivalent to a pot bed but
for the person sitting down it's like a
3X pot bat so it creates it creates a
very interesting Dynamic yeah but in a
way it is kind of similar in bounties as
well because of who covers whom if I
cover you and I can get your Bounty when
I bu you then I can just bet more
because I have the extra value of
getting your Bounty whereas if you cover
me then you don't gain anything extra
from
doubling up against me ah that actually
that makes a lot sense yeah it create it
creates a very interesting Dynamic do
create this imbalance exactly where yeah
like busting you is worth more to me
than you uh doubling out for me then
what's the adjustment I feel like they
have knockout and they have Progressive
knockout if I'm not mistaken right yeah
so Knockouts is when the bounty is
static all throughout the tournament it
starts at a specific value from the
beginning and it's the same value Until
the End whereas Progressive it's what I
mentioned where when you bust someone
you get health his Bounty and the other
health goes on your head and increases
your own Bounty so then by the time the
tournament reaches the final table
bounties will be huge huge then and
multiple times the
buy so I I guess knockout Bic I guess in
a normal knockout in the beginning
bounties are are more important than
later you know compared to the payouts
it's not that important with Progressive
it's different the other way around
exactly exactly in normal bounties the
tournaments the boun at the beginning
are worth a lot but then when you get to
let's say the final table the boundaries
are completely insignificant they mean
absolutely nothing whereas in
Progressive Knockouts the Bounds at the
beginning aren't worth as much but then
they keep on having a pretty high value
all throughout the tournament because
they become bigger and
bigger ah I guess I guess I guess the
designers of bounty tournaments realized
that when they put it the Bounty and
they were like this is no fun at the end
let's let's make the Bounty Progressive
and you were like hey nice a new a new
puzzle to solve right cuz it sounds like
you you enjoy you enjoy the
puzz it's an interesting mindset because
I can also understand that some people
who were studying knucks were like oh
finally studied this [ __ ] now I can play
and then they invite and then they
invent like a new format Progressive
like [ __ ] I finally got this game solved
and now they invented a new game but you
were like nice nice new ad
yeah yeah pretty much like that uh you
talked a little we talk I heard you and
Adam talk about bankr Management in
terms of fi size I guess I from in my
head it was always like more of like a
return of investment but I guess fud
size in terms of variance is more more
important what is some things to take in
consideration when building like your
tournament
schedule um so in terms of selecting
which tournaments you would play of
course you have to go by the bankroll uh
formula based on your capital and the
buyings and the ROI as you said but then
also the field size so this will
definitely help you choose which
tournaments are right for you but then
also you have to keep into consideration
I guess whether you will be burnt out by
that point or how many days you want to
play and this goes more about creating
live tournament schedules like we like
because a lot of people go to Vegas and
they have this schedule of playing every
day and then after playing like for two
weeks they just feel so exhausted but
they end up having to skip some major
tournaments so it's important to try and
figure out what your state of mind will
be at that point so that okay maybe you
can skip a cheaper tournament earlier on
to have enough energy to play the better
more expensive tournament uh towards the
end of the schedule for
example so you can create like some must
plays and some possible plays depending
on how exactly exactly this is this is
exactly how I approach it I have the
mandatory plane days and then I try to
create some space around them like maybe
take a day or you know two days ago or
figure out when I'm going to go out what
I'm going to do B around the mass play
days yeah when in like your tournament
schedule you you mentioned field sides
it's hard it's hard to win a tournament
with like 3,000 Runners would you
deliberately add like some smaller field
tournaments to you know get some more
chances of actually booking a
win um online you don't really have to
do that because you can play in up
tournaments like you can fill out your
screen with different type of
tournaments so you don't have to choose
one over the other I guess this goes
more towards uh live poer and choosing
smaller fields in live where you can you
have to be more selective again I
wouldn't necessarily do that I would
just go for the one that is going to be
the highest EV for me based on how much
time I spend playing it but I can see it
being consideration for maybe someone
who is uh struggling a bit more with
bankroll just too or or even uh like
emotionally booking a win is definitely
going to help boost your morale yeah so
I I I looked at it more from perspective
let's say for example you grind a lower
lower buying range and all the
tournaments are huge I could see like
from my perspective that I would want to
register some tournaments that I
actually have a bigger chance of
reaching a final table you know feel
good about myself and actually booking a
win so that next I'm like w least I have
a win under my belt even though it was
like aund 100 men tournament or
something you know yeah no I can I can
see that it just goes back to what I
said about me not having this emotional
attachment not not really caring so I
wouldn't have this for myself but I can
see how it might be beneficial for some
other people for sure I can see the
logic behind it it just doesn't apply to
me I guess you uh uh you mentioned that
you know you started basically at some
of the lower buyin you then went to the
bit B you're playing I think a 100
average buying had to had to move down a
little bit and therefore and after that
started to move up again when working
your way through the ranks which jump in
Stakes did you find the
hardest H interesting
uh I would say going from like average
buying 200 to 500 I would say that was
the more like the bigger jump because
you go from having a lot of
recreationals you a lot of lowlevel RS
in these 100 to $200 buyings to playing
mostly with good RS at 500 in one case I
think the jump from let's say average
buying 500 to average buying 2K isn't
that big because most of the RS are the
same
we just have different type of
recreationals I guess you still get to
play with the top rates even in the
500s so yeah for me I think that's that
is the biggest jump like between 200 and
500 so basically the the the jump is the
highest where the elite like basically
the Bottom Buying range of elite recks
that's where the jump is highest I feel
like it's a bit similar similar in cash
uh where you have like sort of a low end
where it's like the elite elite would
never go lower for example you would
never see almost never see like the
elite players play 500L but they could
play 2kl for example so 2kl plus like
1020 plus I would say it's a big jump
compared to like 500 NL or 1K NL so that
seems a bit similar what were like some
leaks in your games or ways flaws in how
you approach the game that got exposed
when you were jumping up to this 500 ABI
and how did you go about fixing
them H good question let me try to
remember because it's been uh it's been
some time it's been some
years um I would say the number one
thing that maybe I struggle a bit more
to this day is um sticking a bit too
much to Theory and not deviating enough
against the different opponent types
maybe it's because I give a bit too much
credit to some of my opponents where I
shouldn't I would say this has been the
biggest leak that I I've struggle to
feel for quite some time now just not
deviating enough from Theory and
obviously I don't think there's any
argument that the correct play like the
maximum play will not be GTO in almost
any case you will need to adjust your
opponent's Tendencies and that's going
to be the best play but when you are not
exactly certain of your opponent's
mistakes and then also when you don't
have much confidence that you're doing
that well in the higher binds it's very
easy to just try and stick to GTO and
not uh make adjustments you feel might
be better yeah I would say that is the
one I remember the most a common Trend
like in the podcast especially when
people moved up it's often that you put
your opponents on a pedestal right
you're now playing against these guys
you know they they they almost feel like
super Gods so you're not gonna go out
there and oh these guys must all be
terrible let's throw out all my
exploitive tricks it's easy to to tell
to yourself like ah this probably
doesn't work you know because this is
you know this is this guy and he's he's
so Elite um what what do you think it
was about your opponent's play like what
what makes some what's the difference
between guys the elite guys that play
500 higher compared to like the mid six
guys what makes them so much tougher to
play against on average yeah it's it's
hard to put them all in one group it's
that pretty much all of them do one
thing really good whatever that thing
may be you have the guys that are GTO
Bas that know every sport really really
well then you have the guys who have
just really good intuition like they're
going to know when a spot is extremely
under bluffed or when a spot is over
bluffed or oh this guy took 20 seconds
to bet that means he's weak or strong or
whatever it may be then you have the
guys who are like relentlessly
aggressive who are going to Three B too
much and we're going to Barrel a lot and
this makes them really hard to play
against yes they will end up pting
sometimes but still they're tough
opponents to have against you and there
are a few more categories but basically
it's that all these successful players
they do something very well it's
different among them it's not there's
not one player who is perfect in every
area uh besides Adrian Matos as everyone
knows but uh no uh everyone does one
thing really well and I think this is
what stands
out you mentioned that uh you got
coached the first time I think was by by
K and later that you also joined joined
bitb what has been the biggest
strategical breakthrough in your career
that you were
called um I actually think it was with
the graphical during our first coach
when he did a database analysis of mine
and just went through my stats because
in those 90 minutes we went over like 20
things I was doing wrong habitually
while playing whether it was not raising
up from the button or over folding the
big line or like not seeting up whatever
it was I don't remember exactly what was
10 years ago or whatever but uh that was
definitely the biggest breakthrough for
me because just in 90 minutes I saw 20
things I can work on and I can improve
on and also it just made me understand
and how much more work I need in the
game that I thought I was doing good
in yeah sometimes uh like there's
there's almost no value to be put at a
different perspective right you could
look at your own game be like yeah I I
cannot see what I'm doing wrong anymore
but then someone else can take a look
and be like well I can see what you're
doing wrong and it's like oh W tell me
please tell me please so that's like an
outside eye on your game I think is
insanely
valuable um you mentioned already that
you put in a lot of uh a lot of hours in
study and you go in with a specific goal
right you wanted to fix you wanted to
get an answer and it didn't really
matter if it takes 2 hours or or 10
hours um a lot of our audience listening
you know they're very motivated they
often put in a lot of hours in trying to
improve but they don't really know how
to improve or specifically what to study
what what kind of has highest if you to
study so maybe could you give some
guidelines in terms of which spots you
would recommend studying so which spots
like very high EV and which spots they
should probably stay away from and maybe
go some guidelines in like the study
processes that you follow for sure yeah
so the way I've approached things is to
make a priority list of the things that
I need to study based on how often I
encounter them in game this would be the
first uh the first I guess Factor so
let's say defending the big line it
happens a thousand times every session
so that's something you need to get
really good at but then let's say C
betting in four bet PS
that doesn't come up very often like
usually when you forward it's going to
be an o or the other gu is going to fall
so this is something that is going to be
way lower on the priority list because
it just doesn't matter that much it
happens very rarely and it's also not
that hard not that easy to make mistakes
when you have a super strong forbing
range so number one thing yeah would be
how often does this issue come up while
playing and then second would be how
expensive is it so for example ICM on
Final tables sure you don't make a final
table every day but when you do that
that's when all the money comes in play
so a mistake on a finel table can be way
way more costly than a mistake at the
beginning of the tournament whatever
mistake that is so yeah you have to
consider these two factors how often and
how expensive and then make a priority
list based on that and also the way I
approach things is go at one Topic at a
time I know for others it has been
working to just do a little bit of
everything like oh I'm going to study 1
hour then one hour of P then one hour of
this I get that it just didn't work for
me I just want to focus on one Topic at
a time and when that topic is done we
can move on to the next
one then one more thing that I want to
say and I'm not saying because I am
coaching people but there is no shame in
getting coaching from someone who is
doing better than you at your stakes and
very often you you will get feedback
that you're not expecting to get you
it's easy to think you know everything
that you're doing wrong but yeah you
will often not and I know that from
personal experience
what if you said there's no shame you
think that's kind of what people holds
what what kind of holds people back in
taking coaching not only that but I do
think there I have spoken to some people
so I know not just think that they feel
bad about getting coaching from someone
because they are in a way admitting they
are of inferior knowledge to that person
and they have their ego getting them way
of
that yeah I don't know how often it
happens but I know it does for sure I I
can I definitely can see that happening
I was wondering like if you if you've
identified the leak and you're trying to
fix it how do you how do you measure
progress for
yourself so it would be through just
looking at the start again a few months
afterwards and seeing whether it has
improved or not and if it's not
something that can be track in starts
then maybe through a recording or live
stream whatever form of Poker you're
playing just go back and checking that
you have indeed uh fixed the league
after a few
months I know like uh like most top
players you nowadays use a lot of
solvers but you've been in poker for a
very long time do you recall the time
when solvers came out and like some of
the big aha moments you got from
it yeah I think soers came out just as I
was starting to become a professional
invoker I think it was around the same
time as for the biggest aha moments um
interesting I don't think it was so much
with bios solver I think it was more
when
HRC which is kind of recent when Holdem
resources added the post flop solver so
then you could get the correct pre-flop
strategy for every spot so for example
you would know what to flatten what to
three bit with ICM or in boundary
tournaments and I think this was the
biggest aha moment because you could
clearly see things that you were
thinking about now approved by the
soulare does that give you like a
certain amount of
confidence like I I assume certain
things you were right at and certain
things you were wrong
at no for sure it does um knowing that
the adjustment you were making based on
your assumptions is actually the correct
adjustment to make is definitely a very
big uh confident boost same goes for
when you nolock a s for example like
you're thinking this part oh my opponent
is going to bet less with this hand so
then I'm going to just by doing this and
then when you nolock on the solver and
you see that yeah the solver agrees with
your adjustment that's definitely a very
big confidential
SC I was wondering like at the tables
when you're playing when making
decisions what for you are the most
important things you take in
consideration and what do you think is
something that players way way too much
importance at when making a decision at
the
table Yeah so of course number one thing
that like my thought process is okay
what is the GTO approach here what
should be the correct move that the
solver would do against the solver and
then after arriving to that conclusion I
then start to think how should I adjust
from that based on what I think my
opponent is doing if I don't have a
strong read I'm just gonna go by GTO and
then based on how strong my read is
adjust
accordingly um one thing that I I see
people give a lot of weight to is
whether they think someone is over
bluffing or under bluffing a
spot just as an example and the fact
that someone has a tendency to over
Bluff doesn't mean that you get to call
him down with any two cards and the fact
that someone under Bluffs doesn't mean
that you fold every single Bluff catcher
you have to unless of course it's an
extreme case but I'm talking for like
normal cases and I think people take
this way too far once they think someone
is over bluffing they're like okay
that's it we're never falling to this
guy
anymore and the opposite so I think it's
always important to have I guess
perspective of how big a deviation your
opponent is doing and then deviate ACC L
without going
overb I I I can I can see myself being
guilty of that as well I feel it's like
more of like a hooking buyers where like
oh this guy is a nit and then you kind
of have that in your head and then
you're being put into a specific
scenario whereas like the the stamp of
like well this guy's a nit I'm not going
to call him down it's so big that you're
missing like well this specific texture
my specific hand this specific B size
all these new P of
information they they don't go in
because you you've big stamp like knit
I'm not going to call him down and same
and same with like oh this guy's just
[ __ ] crazy even though your intuition
is scrolling like well maybe you should
actually fall there but like yeah but
this guy is [ __ ] crazy but you know
there's a lot of other variables in play
that you know he's probably not bluffing
enough yeah yeah exactly just not being
absolute and taking everything in
perspective you you mentioned coaching
you do quite a lot of coaching yourself
as well in your experience yeah sorry go
ahead no no no no go I thought that was
the question go I'm sorry no no yeah I
was I was going to say in your
experience like what are the most common
leaks you see the the mid-stakes players
make why do they feel to make that jump
that you made to the to the 500 ABI and
plus first of all the reason that they
don't make the jump I don't think it's
necessarily limited to just their
playing mistakes it also has to do with
uh not having I guess enough conviction
into it not spending enough time not
being devoted or disciplined enough it
not necessarily oh this guy doesn't open
the botton that's why he doesn't play
high stakes it's not just that it's a
lot of things that you need to fulfill
in order to move up and play the high
stakes in terms of let's say statistical
leaks I would say the one that I
mentioned a few times already that
people tend to not raise enough from the
botom and they tend to over fold their
big blind and they tend to play mystery
bounders really
badly mystery bount is very oh wait so
there was another form that we can oh
yeah there's another one there's the
mystery Bounty oh yeah yeah yeah but
mystery
Bounty so how does that the no wait so
the EV of a mystery Bounty I guess in
the beginning is the same but once
bounties go out it starts to change
mystery bounties don't start at the
beginning they usually start when you
reach the in the man stage of the
tournament but then in the beginning
they're all the same right because you
don't know which ones or in which one
you play normal Pokemon until you reach
the money and then you get the Bounties
in
play but then in the beginning you have
like you can give an average EV to a
bounty based on all the prices that are
still in but if all the big ones are
already out the EV
decreases yeah but again this only
happens after you go in the money
there's no boun in play before the money
nothing so BEC so in the in the money
getting in the money becomes more
valuable so the ICM the bubble ICM is
bigger in a way yes and then the
bounties are also huge because when you
get in the man there's like let's say
15% of the field remaining so then a
bounty ends up being worth like three
four starting Stacks so you get in the
money and then suddenly you have a
bounty worth like 20 big lines and you
have a bunch of five big line Stacks or
10 big line Stacks with their boundary
being worth 20 big lines normally
normally after the bubble everyone buff
but here it's it's a literal blood bath
everyone is just thr in all the time
yeah it's just it's just blood bath it's
literal blood bath when the
yeah it's pretty fun how so when going
into the tournament like straight away
firsthand if let's say you just normally
straight away from the beginning how big
of an impact does that already have on
your strategy the fact that getting into
the money is is it zero still because I
can get I can imagine that getting into
the money has more
e sure but when the tourament starts the
money is so far away that it doesn't
really matter okay so it's more in the
bubble that it becomes the bubble
pressure becomes higher than it normally
is in a way yes but then you also have
to think about it from the other side
let's say you are a short stock on the B
near the bubble or before the bubble
well if you make the money you're going
to double up way easier because you're
going to get called by any two cards
when you jump so you're more likely to
double up in like you're going to have
to get C by seven d ssit when you jam
because of how much your bound is work
so then you double up more often after
the bubble but yeah it's a bit
complicated and solvers aren't 100%
accurate on that but yeah it's a new
format I personally don't really like it
but it's popular so so it's popular you
study it you try and try and you try to
become good at it yeah
yeah um Adam you ever played a mystery
Bounty I think this is definitely past
past your time I've never played a
mystery I've never played a bounty
tournament in my life
actually no I've not but it sounds
exciting I like the um the mystery
elements of it where there's something
on the line like you don't know like
this mystery like the mystery Bounty but
it's like creates this kind of novelty
where I'm sure the fish absolutely love
it where you can win like big bounties
like not knowing um so yeah I think
that's a big draw you mentioned that
people misplay these bounties so one of
the things you said to Ren there what
what are the big mistakes that people
don't adjust to for mystery
bounties uh there are many things in
play here and I don't want to get too
deep into strategy uh but basically you
have to be with all the limping involved
and how much you have to call against
opens and against jems it's just a
different kind of game that we're not
really use used to because you're not
used to having let's say 30 dead big BLS
in the pot that you have to play for so
this just creates many different kind of
play styles that uh yeah people aren't
familiar with it comes back to the same
the same principles that you mentioned
in Knockouts right you just have to be
able to convert the Bounty into added
big blinds into the pot and it sounds
like now there's even more big blinds
into the pot and at some point at some
point if there's [ __ ] 50 big lives in
the pot yeah it's uh it's there's quite
a lot of money
one yeah one of the main reasons I don't
like it is especially at higher Stakes
because high stakes mystery bound is
don't get that many Runners so then when
bounties come in play is usually going
to be around the final table so let's
say you make the final table of a 10K
mystery Bounty right you are in the
money you just make the final table and
there are going to be Stacks around 20
big lines and the Bounty will be worth
like 4K big lines so then we're in 10k
Final Table going all in with like Jack
three off against King 7 off against
pocket Dees playing this like massive
three figure or uh like 100k EV Parts
not that's six figures not three like
six figure ports with completely random
hands it's just not very fun I think
also I guess for viewers to watch is
also like who this especially like the
people that don't make the conversion in
their head they're like what are these
people doing these are supposed to be
the best they're going on with Jack
three offs blah blah blah like I can see
from a commercial perspective it's
amazing you know you see this guy drag a
1 million out of an envelope it's great
for TV but I I get what you mean like uh
it has to be a big field with a lot of
recreational players for for it to be
fun exactly exactly for that I can see
it I can see why it's fun whyb
recreational sure but then having like a
10K mystery Bounty with let's say 30
people I I I don't think that's I don't
think that's very
good all right I want to dive into what
allows you to be a good learner so I
think for you you've mentioned you're a
sponge you've learned a lot from being
around coaches other people and you did
a great job with Renee explaining how to
know what to learn so if I think about
being a good learner it's first about KN
what to learn but then it's known how to
learn so how to learn and what you do
specifically I'm really curious about
how do you uh learn topics let's say
you've identified your priority list you
know which is most costly you found the
one topic that you're going to go deep
on maybe you've got some feedback from a
coach who's also highlight this area how
do you solve that problem how do you
spend your day on that getting better at
it yeah I think I touched on this a bit
earlier it's basically about figuring
out the whole picture and not the exact
specific spot so again like running
scripts and checking out similar
scenarios and trying to understand the
underlying logic behind the strategy
this is what I focus on so just making
sure I truly understand the spot and not
just look at the solution and be like ah
okay that's what I should have done
next just like truly understanding why
it happens and how I can replicate it in
the
future when do you know that you've done
enough so for you you're someone who can
do a whole day on a topic when do you
know all right I've got the main
Concepts here understand how the spot
Works how do you kind of stress test
that to know that okay I can move on to
another topic now uh most topics you can
practice a bit on a solver or a trainer
like piber has one in built-in GTO
wizard there are many different uh
trainers that you can practice on and
see that you have indeed learned resport
and then for more um I guess abstract
Concepts like some ICM Concepts uh
there's no real way to know that you've
done enough it's just that when you face
a similar spot you either know what to
do or you don't if you don't well you
haven't done
enough simple as that there a yeah a
past fail scenario at some point where
you either stand up and pass the test or
you fail I have I have one question how
do you fight perfectionism in this area
because like you can go into one spot
like let's say you can put 20 hours into
some spot the first hours are going to
be super valuable because you learn a
lot but then at some at some point you
know you get like to the law of
diminishing returns where it's just
perfectionism very small details where a
lot of that time could be higher if he
put into a different spot where do you
kind of say okay this is too
perfectionistic because I notice a lot
of players when they study in my opinion
they go way too deep and they go way to
deep nuan where I'm like listen it would
have been better maybe you just studied
this spot for three hours moved on to
another spot and then later come back
and go deeper there how do you how do
you fight the the the need for
perfectionism in studying MH I don't
think there's a clear sign of when to
stop I would say when you get to a high
enough accuracy where as you said there
remaining few percentages that's don't
really affect your r that much doesn't
matter but I will once again go back to
how important it is to get the general
picture and that's going to move you
away from perfectionism or from being uh
I guess going after the details too much
because they don't matter it doesn't
matter what you're going to do on this
very specific River on this very
specific runout it's about oh what do I
do when the river is like the for Flash
and just studing this kind of idea and
not the exact spot and I think this
answers your question about
perfectionism quite a bit just get the
general idea not the exact spot so when
you notice that you're going too much
into details into specific spots and
kind of lose the bigger picture that's
when you're like okay maybe I should uh
maybe I should move on to a next spot
yeah exactly and maybe there are some
super weird exception spots where you
look at it and you like oh this does
happen anywhere else why does this
happen here well it's fine to not not
spend any time in that if it doesn't
come up it just doesn't matter basically
yeah so you have to recognize this not
as like hey so but then you have to
recognize this as not being a potential
big aha moment which you don't really
know beforehand I mean I've went down to
the rabbit hole sometimes and sometimes
it was a lot of hours waste of my time
but sometimes there was something in it
you know how do I then identify before I
put all that hours in that this is going
to be you know a waste of time time mhm
I think the best way for that is to run
some scripts and then quickly see on a
document whether what you noticed
happens more or not I have an example of
this some time ago I noticed that let's
say under the gun versus big line under
the gun cits and then on a specific
board like h55 or something it was the
big line would raise to like 10x the CED
and I was like huh I didn't know that
was a thing very interesting let's dive
deeper into that so when I run a bunch
of scrip for different positions
different boards stacks and so on H to
see is this actually a thing and the
answer was no it's not a thing it never
happens only on this board with some
very low frequency specific hands so
then that's not something I need to
spend time or care about because it's so
small so insignificant but yeah it's not
worth the time yeah and that one time a
year that XD h55 comes
like 10x let's go sure that is it's not
worth the time that makes sense makes
sense but I'm glad you clarified that
because I think
was a little bit of an unanswered
question may head especially what Ren
said as well like because a lot of
players do get lost in going too deep
and I think for you the kind of key
lesson there is always remember the big
picture like being a little zoom out and
kind of knowing the difference between
the forest and the weeds like the big
picture of what you're trying to see and
then knowing when you're digging that
down into the weeds that like okay I
could find some treasure here but
generally this is low value I've got the
big picture stuff I think for you
obviously you've perfected that skill to
know what the big picture is and what
you're trying to find I think a lot of
players just go on this kind of this
diamond hunt trying to find that like
needle in the hair back and there spend
six hours and they're like oh oh found
something and then they like they look
back and go oh yeah that spot never
happens ever ever ever okay cool but I
learned some stuff and I think it's the
I learned some stuff but I learned some
valuable stuff I think for you because
you've got that zoomed out lens and you
look for the big picture you're able to
do that very well so I'm glad glad we
clarified that all right I want to do
some reflecting on your PO career
looking back and seeing some lessons
you've learned so first question is what
would you say is the most important
lesson you've learned for your PO
career um definitely has to do with
variant and how
you cannot control whether you win or
lose you can only control how you play
and the rest will come by far number one
I
think yeah that's the one way you've got
to kind of learn the hard way sometimes
I think variance we can look at variance
calculators all day we can logically go
oh this can happen x amount the time but
until you've experienced variance
emotionally with a lot of money on the
line during tough times and had to sit
through the variance and push through it
it it takes a long time to uh to get to
experience and learn the lesson high
level and it's just so different from
other areas of life as well because in
pretty much every other aspect of life
when you do good you get rewarded that's
it that's how life works well not
necessarily in tournament
poker yeah that's true yeah I think for
tournament poker as well like there it's
so many unknowns I think other formats
have more like EV that you can look at
whereas MTS it's very hard to know like
do I just suck like am I running bad is
this variance when's it going to end so
I think as you mentioned your your way
of know getting coaches to look at your
game reviewing your game recording
sessions looking back all these things
allow you to build more confidence so
during these bad patches of variant you
can like know that you're playing well
or at least have some more confidence
that you're not deluding
yourself yeah yeah exactly all right I
want to know about your definition of
success and how that's changed over the
G so your your definition of success
right
now right now okay um so right now being
able to do you mean for me right the
success for me or in general for you for
me yeah so being able to do what I like
and making a great living out of it
while also getting to travel the world
meet new people it's just I I don't want
anything else I'm I'm very satisfied
with that how has that change compared
to Alex 10 years ago getting into poker
after these game in background yeah 10
years ago I think it was much more about
oh I have to make some money I have to
win some more money and of course this
is still very very important and the
reason why I play the game but it's
definitely not like the number one thing
or the only
thing did that change for you was there
a kind of Landmark Financial goal you
hit or a progression that you had where
you're like ah I I'm caring about the
money bit less right now and I'm
starting to just enjoy the lifestyle and
the process of
plan yeah I think as you said it came
when I started being more financially
free and I was at the point and I met a
point where I can comfortably do things
that I want in life and then getting
more money doesn't necessarily change
that I think there's in terms of
finances there's a point where you are
comfortable and you can do the things
you want and then making more than that
is just extra it doesn't really change
your way of life much at all so I think
this was the point after which I started
caring more about the other things yeah
I think that's a big point that big
transition moment where often in the
early days like the money you make can
change your lifestyle or at least
perceived Lifestyle the the life you
live day to day then you get to a point
where you're like okay more money would
be good but my dayto day will look the
same like I'm still going to wake up the
same time live the same way live in the
same house spend the same money ah cool
so I can increase my bank role but now
it's just a different relationship to
that and I think once you you get to
that point for you some people just keep
improving their spends like they keep
spending more and more bigger house
bigger car more expense so those guys
have a harder job getting to that kind
of settle point but I think it's a good
point to observe because then you can go
right cool I did this for the money and
I got to this point now what do I really
care about and as you mentioned like
kind of Freedom be a to travel be able
to just play this game that you enjoy
for a Liv in that becomes like a
stronger motive and a a more
long-lasting one and also the
competition like competing at the
highest level against the smartest
people in poker is also something I
really really
enjoy so this next question might link
to that but I'm curious to know at what
moments in your PO career have they been
have been the most enjoyable and what do
you do now to keep poker
enjoyable mhm so in terms of the whole
like poker experience I think just
studying I enjoy a bit more than playing
even because I just care about the
strategy and by starting you get to dive
into the strategy without having any
variance involved in that whereas when
you play yes you get to execute the
strategy but then the result doesn't
necessarily necessarily prove that what
you did is
correct so I would say I actually enjoy
studing a bit
more plane but in terms of a more like
practical downt experience I would say
that this year has been one of the best
of my life both in terms of results and
the places I've been to and just
everything so yeah it's still a very
enjoyable experience to me what made
this year so
special um running good but then also
the Liv stop that I went to I went to
Korea for triton which is a very unique
place and not a place I expected to
visit then also some places in Europe I
went like to Oslo and um Luxembourg and
some again places you don't really
expect to visit so I definitely enjoyed
those so all that combined with uh again
running good which it's an important
thing of uh of how your gear goes I
guess even though yes results don't
really affect you you're still gonna be
happy if you win a million and you're
still gonna be a bit less happy if you
lose a million right it's just it's very
human I
think um and just yeah overall didn't
have any misfortunes I guess this year
either did this year motivate you to do
more traveling play more Liv stops from
your experiences this
year um truth is not really because I
don't enjoy live poker as much as I do
online I find online poker just more
entertaining because I don't appreciate
the extra skill set of live poker so
much I'm guessing it's quite boring for
you as well right the speed of play
being a gamer yeah yeah exactly so
online the skill set the extra skill set
compared to live you need to be able to
multitask and play many tables and like
think very quickly whereas in live
things are much slower as you said and
the extra skill set is oh I need to take
15 seconds to act every time or oh I
need to count the time between my
breaths or oh I need to not blink
quickly just like things that I
understand are part of the skill set and
they're hard to do but I don't enjoy
them yeah that's a big thing to know
like what you enjoy and and what's your
kind of skill set it's not a natural
strength yes you could get good at it
but it's not something you naturally
gravitate to the same way you do mul
table online so you mentioned that you
believe that anyone can achieve success
if they commit themselves to it so so do
you believe anyone could follow your
path and make it as a high stakes MTT
player MH the answer is yes so I think
there are basically two paths towards
becoming a very successful tournament
player one is that you have some sort of
natural gift whether it is picking up
patterns really quickly or uh like
timing tells or just getting into the
other person's mind there are a lot of
uh examples of players like that who
don't necessarily study too much but
have this special gift I guess in a way
that that allows them to be very very
successful now that's not something you
can replicate that's not something you
can teach that's yeah you either have it
or you don't but then there's the other
type of player which I think I fall into
which is the player that just works hard
and studies and spends time into it and
just sees it as the job where you have
to click a button and I think everyone
can do that as long as they have this
like inner dialogue and they realize
what they have to do to get
there I don't think I have any unique
special skill set or any attribute that
allows me to do what I do I think it's
just all grown on
me yeah that's good so for you you feel
like all the skills you have have been
developed either through maybe some of
your gaming background for the multi
table in but a lot of them in the
battlefield of Poker I think often it's
like from the outside looking in it's
really hard to distinguish between what
are kind of natural talents that
someone's just very good at so they have
success and which of them do they not
really have grown up or in their early
experiences and they had to build during
poker I think po one of those ones where
most skills that players have at the top
they've had it developed through through
the Journey obviously IQ speed of
thinking some of those things are quite
um kind of yeah dependent on your
genetics but a lot of things you develop
through through playing through learning
through repetition so what what was you
what you say is the most important trait
or skill that a aspiring poker player
maybe who's stuck at the lower to Mid
Stakes would have to develop in order to
uh bridge that Gap and start reaching
towards High
staks yeah I would say just
understanding that poker is basically
statistics and you just have to follow
the Ms and play your strategy and click
your buttons and then things will come
just not have an emotional attachment
again I understand some people enjoy
that but for me this was like the key
moment where I just stop caring about oh
do I win do I lose did this guy block me
none of this matters it's just
statistics you click a button and that
button makes you money and that's what
you have to do that's your job so I
think just getting these like distance
from all the ego all the feelings or
everything else involved with poker I
think once that is done then there's
nothing stopping you what would you say
to that player who's like that sounds
amazing I would love that please sign me
up but when I play I experience so many
emotions I feel the frustration it hurts
so much when I lose my ego's on the line
I feel like it lose our times I feel all
these mixed bag of emotions when I'm
playing and I can't separate what I know
in my logical mind the statistics the
game from what I'm experiencing any
words for that person who's watching
right now or listening who's struggling
there I would introduce them to
[Laughter]
you so this is a bit tough
because I I I don't feel like I'm
equipped to answer that because it's
just something that has worked for me
and it's something that grew on me
gradually I don't I don't really have
any advice just it has to do about
convincing yourself that this is the
case you just have to like talk with
yourself and figure it out that's what
worked for me anyway I'm I'm afraid I
don't have any words of wisdom on that
so your yeah well your story even though
even though you might not be able to
like piece together that exactly what
happened because it's been a long po a
journey like you've shown that you can
develop these traits it wasn't like you
were naturally gifted at it and I think
sometimes for sure just knowing you can
get better at something I think I think
a lot of people they limit themselves
with beliefs because they go oh this how
I am oh it's okay for Alex cuz he didn't
experience emotions but me I'm not like
that but in real know Alex also wasn't
like that and he worked on that and he
got better at it for repetition for
exposure and now he's great because he
doesn't think about H what the losing
but that wasn't him five years ago when
he was stuck at whatever Stak I think
it's good to uh relay that uh quick
Fanny story when I first started playing
uh again it was like per second year of
union or something I got a uh boxing how
do you call it the thing hanging from
the ceiling for boxing to have next to
my office so that every time I would I
don't know get bad beat or lose a flip
or something I would just get up and
punch that to get the like anger out so
yeah I definitely was was in that place
Once Upon a Time Yeah speed ball one of
those ones you do that with yeah yeah
yeah yeah I had a punch bag in my garage
when I was
init yeah yeah yeah I think it's one of
those understanding that pocket does
bring a lot of emotions to the surface
especially early on and as you mentioned
when your identity is involved in its
Financial pressures in in the short term
you're going to experience that as
emotions and frustrations and just
knowing that this will pass at some
points you can get better at dealing
with them it's not always going to be as
intense as it is now and yeah almost
everyone's had to do the work get the
repetition in to uh kind of get past
that even the guys they look up to who
uh maybe like yourself who don't have
that issue now you still to do the work
over time to uh to get to that situation
so I think it's a good thing to remind
people who are struggling to uh instill
that logical framework when emotions are
coming up all right I've got a question
to ask this my my my own curiosity I'm
sure other people are curious as well
I'm curious to know how do you think
about who are the best players at mtts
so like at Cash games there's a clear
hierarchy right so like the the best
players b battle each other and the best
RS kind of respect each other go right
these guys are the top five 10 players
I'm sure most of the top cashing players
will agree who's the kind of the top
players in mtts is there a CL clear
hierarchy let's talk about online mti's
of who the best players are in terms of
theoretically the best the toughest to
play against and if there is who are
some of the players that most of you top
R started think these guys are in the
pool of the best MDT players
online I definitely don't think there is
a very clear ranking because there are
also so many things to consider when
making that list how are you going to
rank who's the best is it gonna be for
who has won the most money well then
it's going to be like some wslp Main
Event winner it's GNA be for who has the
biggest GTO like theoretical knowledge
well yeah but this guy might not be
playing the highest e moves because it
all has to do about
exploiting then you have the exploit
guys yeah but how do you know if their
exploits are actually good you you can
Bas it on so it's it's very tough to
come up with a list of who is the best
you can add people to a group like these
guys are really good because this guy
does this well this guy does that well
but it's hard to rank them at least for
me it's hard to say oh this guy is the
best and then the second is this and
then the third is
this and I think a lot of people uh
disagree about a ranking as well like I
don't think you can find enough people
who will say will agree on a ranking of
tourament players yeah for sure I I can
imagine it's like pretty much impossible
to get a a clearcut one two to 10 I was
just thinking maybe there's some players
who in all ranking variables can arise
to the top because like all right we
factor in a lot of stuff all of us
clever regs we all know who's kind of
good at certain things and between like
a big pool of you guys underground
you're like all right he's definitely
one of the top five to 10 guys he's
definitely one of the top five to 10
guys but yeah it might be so hard to uh
to even get that close to that to a list
yeah again it's tough to say especially
because as uh like competitors my job is
to spot their mistakes and take
advantage of them right so I'm focusing
a lot more on people's mistakes than on
what they do well so then also my image
of how they play is gonna be skewed more
towards their mistakes it's GNA be
easier for me to say oh this guy yeah
this guy does this and this and that
wrong and this guy does that and that
and that wrong so it's easier for me to
have a more negative picture of how
people play than I guess someone
observing from the outside because it's
what I'm FOC stone for my game um but in
terms of players for me I've always uh
looked up to
a lot of players graphical being I guess
the most prominent one um that's why I
chose him as a coach as well so many
years ago and I still think he's by far
one of the best out there at least in
terms of theory and hey he won best up
and cominging player of the year or
something last year which is pretty
funny up and coming yeah yeah yeah up
and coming he been playing for like 15
years or something that's it right I
think I think like the Longevity if you
look at okay who are the guys that have
been for example take Lena for example
now also with his recent wcp score but
guys that have just been grinding these
mtts for T tens of years always at the
highest takes I guess in mtts it's more
the longevity that really kind of
filters out who are who are the best for
sure for sure yeah for sure because in
the short term anyone can win
tournaments so exactly if they keep on
waiting for many many years then they're
probably doing a lot of things
right you mentioned when you play
against players you're thinking from
their weaknesses what can I exploit what
can I get advantage of this player I'm
curious to know for you let's say you're
playing a final table and it's a quite a
tough lineup and I think a lot of
players would maybe start to get
self-conscious that these guys could be
really good maybe there's some players
who you've built a bit of fear against
because their reputation or something
like that how do you in the moment of
battle in a tough Final Table lineup or
against a 10K tournament or something
how do you how does your mind sort of
process like what you're trying to gain
from that experience in terms I'm
playing some good players I'm trying to
learn from them and absorb knowledge or
playing some guys I can exploit how does
your mind kind of navigate uh different
player profiles when you're on like a
tough
lineup yeah again I will just do my best
to try and figure out how I can make
money out of them so I'm going to go
through looking at specific reads I have
for these players looking at previous
footage of tournaments they've played
and try to find out what do they do
wrong and how can I capitalize on that
because even the best players everyone
makes mistakes right so then trying to
figure out what their mistakes are is
still where my focus is going to be like
I will focus more of course on trying to
exploit the weaker recreational player
than the top high stakes Pro but yeah I
will still focus more on trying to
figure out their
mistakes you mentioned you record a lot
of your sessions and you watch them back
what are some of the insights you gain
from that process of rewatching them
because I'm thinking this is something
that most players won't be doing and I'm
wondering what is kind some the insight
to you g when you kind of rewatch a full
session
back so I would say that the number one
thing that I noticed is that I tend to
sometimes click fold on a mediocre hand
when I have a decision elsewhere so
let's say I have a big decision on one
table and then I want to spend all my
focus there so then I'm going to quickly
try to make decisions on the other
tables so that I don't have to spend
time on them and when I'm in that stage
I'm very often just going to click
autofold on let's say King seven offs on
the bottom which is supposed to be uh
one of the bottom opens so this is one
of the things that I've noticed for sure
where when I have my attention focused
on a big decision I will make some
marginal folds on some other tables
which is something really hard to pick
up if you're not
recording yeah I can imagine that as
well like just looking at the hand rep
player is going to be very hard to spot
a lot of these little tendencies that
CRP up do you also when you look back at
the session do you look at other players
or you mainly looking at how you've
played um I'm mostly looking at myself
because you get so many so limited
showdowns from the other players that
it's going to be pretty tough to pick
suban substantial information up uh for
observing other players playing it's
more about the uh cards up replays that
they have my own poker star
GG yeah yeah I can imagine you won't get
enough of a sample size of cards CS the
C to to watch back yeah Ren for you do
you do any recording of your sessions
have you found it interesting to watch
yourself back or learn anything from a
recording I remember one of my
housemates who was playing a Long Heads
of battle and he got crushed off this
other player and he's couldn't figure
fig out why he lost to him and then it
turned out the other guy was recording
their sessions playing and watching it
back get guys the playing and he picked
up lots of time tells on him basically
theoretically was like not as good but
he just like crushed him on some more
timeing Ts and that kind of highlight to
me like oh wait a second there's
something in watching these sessions
back and I started doing it myself in R
battles in particular I'd recall the
sessions watch them back and yeah lots
of insights that you uh you can't gain
by being in it so yeah I'm C don't for
you R if you have a recorded sessions in
watch them back I was going to say
timing tells is definitely the first
thing that come comes to my mind mind
that you can spot more when you watch a
session back than if you're actively
thinking and you know you're doing a lot
of things when you're just observing
like H that was pretty quick or ah that
that that took long and then you can
kind of start to because your mind is a
bit more clear right you don't have to
think about actually making the decision
you're just observing and therefore like
specifically timing tells they they send
out to me but yeah I've recorded a lot
of sessions and watch back sessions also
then watch back with other players to
kind of see like because I feel like if
you do for example just a htis review
session with some other players you're
already kind of selecting hands whereas
if you just review a live play sometimes
you know there's just nothing and it's
not that interesting but sometimes I
don't know you just do something or
there's a specific spot that someone
says oh I would definitely not do this I
mean it would not have been a hand that
I would have selected to review so
basically you also get to see hands that
you thought maybe were standard or
situations you just thought were
standard that actually other people
don't think are as standard so I think
that's that's very helpful um Alex kind
of wrapping this off um what would you
describe as kind of the high point in
your career the thing that you're most
proud
of the high point of my career that I'm
most proud of H interesting um there are
a lot of moments that come to mind I
guess like winning a bracelet or stuff
like that online bracelet sadly but
bracelet nonetheless but I would say
doesn't necessarily have to do with a
win it's more so just the moment I
realize that okay I succeeded in the job
that I chose and I am financially free
to do what I want and I can stay in the
house that I like and do the things I
like and outside of finances too I just
have freedom in my life I don't have a
boss I can do whatever I want whenever I
want and I did that on my own so I would
say just like this realization would be
the high point
yeah I think I think definitely
something to to to be proud of for sure
how do you see the future of Poker and
how do you see yourself in
it yeah online poker looks a bit Grim
I'm not going to lie uh there are so
many tools and new tools introduced
every day to help you solve hands really
quickly and they can be used real time
just a few days ago we had the release
of a GTO wizard AI ICM solver so you can
Sol ICM hands in a few seconds so this
is so easy to use for anyone on a fining
table and it's going to provide so much
EV gain that it's really worrisome and
yes they have their fair play check in
order but you can just do it from
another computer or have someone do it
for you I'm I'm not very optimistic
about the future of online pocker unless
all these tools decide to provide some
sort of delay or just some preventative
measure from people using it in real
time while playing
and there is also a bit of a conflict of
interest because GTO wizard wants their
software to be as usable as possible by
the way I'm bringing GTO wizard because
it's the most uh commonly used one it's
not just them but yeah on one hand they
want their software to be as quick and
as easy as possible so that they make
the most money but then on the other
hand this causes it to be very dangerous
for the Integrity of the game so yeah I
think there's a bit of a conflict there
that it's not easy to resolve so yeah
I'm not too optimistic about online fer
that having been said I don't think it's
as bad as some people paint it out to be
on Twitter and whatnot I don't think
cheating is that rampant and you can see
it from the number of mistakes that you
see people make on big final tables
every
day so right now I think it's okay but
I'm not very optimistic about the future
live poer on the other hand I think has
a very bright future ahead it's booming
because cheating is way tougher there so
I definitely think life will continue to
grow and then online
unless there's a drastic change I'm not
I'm not very
optimistic how but in ter and in terms
of your own future plans in poker so you
already mentioned that the Live extra
skill set is not something that you
specifically enjoy but you do see a
bright future I mean you know Live
Events they keep on
growing yeah I'm actually not very sure
about that as I said I don't really like
scheduling my days and my life so much
so I'm not sure for how much more I'm
going to be playing poker for I don't
have any plans to quit currently but if
let's say online starts going really
downhill and then live is my only option
I can see myself starting to move away
from poker any any other interest that
you might pursue or not currently on
your
mind um not much on my mind right now
because poer is such a full-time job
with like the playing the studying the
traveling the coaching everything but uh
yeah I just don't really have time to do
many other things outside poker no more
head space to think about other things I
can see that yeah yeah what would you
like the main takeaway for our audience
to be of the conversation we had
today um I think I want to move back to
how I I really think anyone can succeed
in playing poer and just as long as you
put in the work and you mentally prepare
yourself for what is to come um it's
it's achievable for everyone I think
maybe that should be the closing point
and that should be the
takeaway all right Adam any final
questions no I think it's a perfect way
to wrap up the conversation thank you
very much Alex for sharing your wisdom
really appreciate you spend the last few
hours with us thank you very much for
having me it was it was a blast I had a
great time all right great conversation
with Alex Adam what are your main
takeaways of our conversation
today I like the start of the
conversation when he said that he likes
to always expect the worst this is a
very counterintuitive mindset especially
for MTT players who normally get very
excited for for deep runs final tables
where often like that's say it's a big
tournament and you're just thinking
about your strategy then you get to the
final table and there's 100K up top a
lot of players like wow this could be it
this could be the big moment whereas for
him he does the opposite he's like all
right I could finish ninth here and
that's okay I think this allows him to
really low expectations in a way that
allows him to focus on the strategy of
the game and just playing poet I think
anything that can take you away from
thinking of the external outcomes and
get you back in touch with your playing
your strategy works as pry good so he
said for him it works well he's
mentioned it some of the players and it
doesn't work as well so this is one if
you're you are M player you maybe try
for yourself see if you can low
expectations maybe you don't need to go
as Extreme as worst case scenario but
maybe lower expectations to not get too
attached to uh those big external
outcomes could be good he mentioned how
he learns from mistakes I thought was
very good he's very hard on himself in
those moments and he allows that to fuel
him to not make that mistake again in
future so you mentioned is it a mistake
that I should know should know better by
that he means he should know the
strategy away from the tables if so he's
very harsh on himself to fix that estate
immediately and has very high standards
with that for him that creates enough
tension to want to solve the problem but
not enough performance anxiety or um
kind of frustration in the moment to
impact performance in a bad way and then
he mentions if it's a mistake that he
doesn't know the strategy he's very
quick to study that spot and want to
learn and get better so yeah I think I
like that I know for you Rena you
mentioned it was the opposite for you
more compassion I remember European he
was saying the same for him so yeah
you've got to find that style for
yourself but the main thing is how can
you learn from mistakes in the moment
and also process mistakes allow yourself
to move past them as they're happening
He also mentioned how hard he works how
disciplined he's been and yeah I think
he's a very good example of where you
can get to in poker with the right work
ethic and approach so right now he
talked about having no ego no feelings
no gambling Tendencies and it's very
easy to go all right well cool he's a
bit of a freaking nature I can never do
that but at the same time he's 10 years
ago that wasn't the version Alex that he
W what he was and he's built these kind
of tra for a lot of hard work a lot of
kind of repetition um he also has a
unique approach the studium which I
thought was interesting where he has
kind of big study days and there's a a
full day on one spot whereas other
players might study one hour two hours
before their grinds again it's what
works for him but I thought it was very
interesting that he's found this kind of
allows to go deep and as far as he wants
to with study in without compromising
his grinding and that's yeah having
alternated days so yeah I really liked
all his approach in terms of mind I
think he's got a very uh balanced solid
mindset to see he has no gambling
Tendencies as an MTT player I think he
actually a bit of a superpower because
most players gravitate towards mtts
because they have a little bit of gamble
in them so to not have that I think
could give him an edge in a lot of
scenarios especially with yeah
expectations getting high with big
fields so yeah lots of good stuff and I
WR a lot more notes but yeah they're the
main ones how about yourself Ren what
were the main takeaways for you I think
he he has the ability to be very
reflective on himself and try to come up
with improvements he didn't really talk
about deliberate practices or anything
but for example what you were saying
that he noticed that he would get very
upset because he might have had big
expectations and then he reflect on it
well how can I come up with a new
mindset that would El leviate me from
the pain that I'm currently feeling
right so I feel like he's been very
reflective and finding ways to adjust
his routines and the way he does it his
mindset in order to have a more
enjoyable ride I guess we could say it
so definitely shout out to Alex for uh
for how he's how he has improved over
the years uh some things that I wrote
down is enjoying solving the puzzle he's
definitely very curious right some
people when knockout tournaments came
out they might be like oh [ __ ] another
for to study I finally felt like I
started to get a hand handle off mtts
but he was very very curious he loves
solving the puzzle so for him a new
format that's great uh he mentioned
study the bigger pictures and be aware
if you go too deep into the Nu on this
was also a question that I kind of
interrupted Adam on like how do we then
deal with perfectionism he said well if
you go too much into the specific weeds
of like a specific spot be be be worry
and go back to like what was the bigger
picture of this spot because that's what
you want to know you want to kind of
understand the
mechanics um the ability to convert
bounties into chips that was kind of I
think the main takeaway from the
adjustments you have to make in knockout
tournaments so how much is a bounty now
worth and how can I convert that to
chips and then kind of now see how much
chips am I actually risking to win how
much right because in the end then it
becomes sort of a normal tournament
again so that's was I think kind of the
main takeaway regardless of if it was a
normal Bounty a progressive Bounty a
mystery Bounty it kind of came back to
this main principle uh he also mentioned
about not over adjusting versus specific
player profiles I think this he answered
when I asked him about common leaks and
then he said like yeah people now stop
hero calling completely versus a nit and
always call versus guy was very
aggressive but it's a bit more Nuance to
that so I thought that was actually
pretty valuable advice as well
definitely something that I can
personally relate to and in terms of
studying we can also see that he got
coached by kco because he think kco said
exactly the same thing he said you have
to study spots that are frequent or very
high in EV so frequent he talked about
big blind defense button open spots and
high in EV talked about for example
Final Table
ICM overall a lot of great knowledge
thank you very much Alex for coming on
and sharing this with our audience I
want to thank Adam for asking bright
questions as always best co-host in the
poker industry I want to thank the
audience for listening to this episode
