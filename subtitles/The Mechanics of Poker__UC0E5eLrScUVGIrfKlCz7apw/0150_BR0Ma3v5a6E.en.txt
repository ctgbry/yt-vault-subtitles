but without further ado let's get into
today's episode
hi there fellow poker enthusiasts
welcome back to another episode here on
the mechanics of poker podcast episode
number eight i think we're already we
got a premiere for today's episode as we
have the youngest high player on that
we've had so far he dropped out of
school like many to play poker and
currently plays up to five knl both
heads up and six max cash games and no
he didn't start at an illegal age i just
wanted to make that very clear to maybe
some poker sites who are watching shout
out to pokestars he just moved up really
quickly as it took him only three and a
half years to get to 2k so far one of
the fastest rises that we've had on now
normally you would say
we are going to be talking with some
sort of a whisk kid with an iq of 160
just smooth silt and everything he did
but he actually mentioned it was work
ethic he had to always work hard and he
believes that hard work beats talent
meaning that with the right work ethic
and approach you can follow in his
footsteps which is going to make this
podcast extra interesting he has shared
his insights into poker before both on
twitch youtube and as a coach for run at
once in which his videos receive
an insane amount of popularity compared
to other video makers i'm talking about
luke clanty johnson he's gonna be our
guest here today adam
what are you excited for with mr clanty
coming on
yeah i'm really looking forward to uh
distilling how kanti has been able to
rise to the top so quick like this is
our eighth guest on the shore and clancy
potentially is our fastest riser to the
high sticks so i want to distill what
he's done differently in his approaches
very often success leaves clues and if
someone's doing something faster or
better than the competition they're
generally doing something different
which we want to pay attention to i'm
very intrigued how he deals with down
swings and generally when you're moving
upstairs aggressively you're going to
experience downswings that are kind of
faster rate every almost month or six
months you're experiencing a very
monumental downswing relative to what
you've experienced see i'm really
interested to hear how he's dealt with
all that and also his approach to
learning like you said his videos are
incredibly popular everyone loves his
strategy videos and run at once so i'm
really intrigued to know obviously more
about his thought processes around poker
and his overall approach so yeah what
are you looking forward to for this
guest right now
i think also confidence wise normally
players i think we talked about with
goose core as well right he needs to put
in a big sample at a certain stake and
have like that nice graph he was saying
you could you could see you could see
the the twink on his eyes when he said
you know the nice graph which is kind of
a confirmation like okay i've beat the
steak you know i'm moving on and it
sounds like if you move on so fast
you're not waiting
you don't have the urge to wait for a
very big variance-free sample in order
to
show to yourself i beated the game right
i think he moved on to the next stake
before he got that confirmation so
that i think requires a lot of
confidence
so very excited to start a conversation
with mr clanty
all right there he is luke
how are you man thank you for coming on
doing very well thanks guys for having
me on appreciate it
so actually i wanted to have you on a
little bit earlier
i contacted you i think it was
in the beginning of the year
and you responded to me and i'm gonna
quote
i'm down swinging hard lately and don't
feel like being social which i
completely understand the last thing i
want to do
when i'm in a downswing is talk to
people i want to do a sit behind my
computer and try to find a way out of it
right so i've responded to you
let me quote completely understand no
worries maybe after you turn things
around we can have you on and talk about
how you did it flex emoji
and here you are
okay so we're gonna start off the pot a
little bit different than usual given uh
our history here
um
pay attention i'm gonna put you on the
spot i'm gonna fire some questions
obviously the first thing everyone is
very curious about is did you get out of
the downswing right that would be
question
number one the second one is
is locking yourself up from the outside
world your standard protocol in
downstream
and the third one would be
what are some things
you do to try to turn it around okay so
start with start um yeah i did get the
dancing i actually think that was the
end of last year
i have had a history with failed shots
of 5k and i'm just like i was really fed
up with that because it was a rinse
repeat process of win low lose at high
so it was
those were the reasons why if i have a
downswing usually i'm pretty good at
dealing with it actually but i was just
really fed up of this rinse repeat mode
of lose everything at 5k and then yeah
move back down
i think that was around like november
december time
um
so i did get out of that downswing
eventually
uh two no you shouldn't lock yourself up
i'm
i mean i wasn't fully locking myself up
i didn't feel like coming on a podcast
you know
but i still was you know exercising
going out and i wasn't socializing as
much as i would usually but i was still
doing things
i definitely don't recommend i used to
do that a lot and just
almost like going into hibernation mode
um there's a word oh i used to call
myself a hermit because i would never go
out when i was losing i would just kind
of stay inside and and just kind of not
even regrind it's not even like i was
being a hermit and just playing poker
all the time and studying poker it was
just being like a slob and playing video
games and just like recovering that way
which is obviously not the thing to go
also as well partly it's the weather in
in newcastle we're just talking about it
but
november december newcastle weather is
just crap
um it's like it's dark at half three so
it's it's really depressing if you're
like getting crushed at high stakes and
then you can't even go out for a walk
because it's dark by 3 30 or like four
o'clock so that's also part of it
whereas now it's nice and it's getting
better
and three i can't remember what was the
third question
yeah i i don't blame you i don't blame
you we just got started a fire of three
questions okay i catch you by surprise
the third one was this what do you try
to do
to turn it around to turn things around
so you managed to get out of the
downswing
what did you do to manage to get out of
the downswing
wait everything stays pretty consistent
do my studying do my playing i think the
only thing that i change up is i take a
few more breaks i'm not someone who just
plays a lot when they lose i do the
opposite actually i play less i don't
like losing i don't find it fun so i
typically take a few more breaks like i
might take a weekend off for example
um and also i um like offer sessions
with friends as well like
extra study sessions so i usually study
with ben on wednesdays and a couple of
times i asked him if he wanted to do
extra things
and then also with the jericho as well i
offered him um like a session too so
well i say offered like it was you know
not like that basically like asking
people if they want to do some
let's say extracurricular studies and
that's a way of me getting back on the
on the wagon so i would say everything
stays pretty consistent apart from a few
extra breaks and then a few extra study
sessions
otherwise pretty normal
yeah i think i think the response of
wanting to play more and wanting to lock
yourself in
makes a lot of sense right you're in a
situation that you don't like and you
want to do everything in your power to
turn that around and usually then you
think okay i should just play more i
should i should work harder but if you
think about it playing more when you're
in a downswing you're playing at a lower
win rate so playing more only makes the
downswing bigger but to then
basically take a step back and do
something different
it's so counterintuitive for the mind
right
yeah i'm not someone who does very well
with losing i find it really frustrating
i don't necessarily like have monkeytilt
issues or anything but i just don't play
my best when i'm losing i find it boring
and i get distracted i'll go on to
twitch or
two plus two or something and like while
i'm playing poker and i notice i can't
it's not even focused whereas if i'm
winning um i'm you know lasered into the
tables so yeah that's definitely part of
it my focus isn't there my win rate's
not what it would be if i was even just
doing
a breakeven session but if i'm getting
crushed i'm just bored
i was actually quite surprised when uh
when i read in your question or that you
also
wrote down that you're easily annoyed
and frustrated whereas in your videos uh
or
at for example at run at once or i saw a
couple of your videos on youtube twitch
you come across to me as like a gto bot
you know so either you're really really
trying to keep it in or we're watching
like take number
but in which way do you then
show your frustrations and does it also
does it impact your game as well
i don't
i think it has to in some way i don't i
don't think i could just say oh no it
doesn't impact my game at all i
definitely like that i don't spew off
stacks
but uh i might
not check folder hand that's
really really frisky where it's like i'm
sorry fringy where i might decide i'm
just not gonna fold it this time maybe
that happens occasionally also my levels
of frustration
um i don't necessarily get annoyed about
getting cauted or something like that
it's more so if someone does something
really stupid where i don't i i think
about it it doesn't make sense and then
i think oh they're professional they
should be better than that that kind of
annoys me so i don't get annoyed by
getting called it it's more so if a
professional does something silly that
annoys me more than
like having a really bad day where i got
called back to back to back so it's more
like quite nuanced in the frustration if
that makes sense i might get annoyed
about someone's seabed on a board like
let's let's say uh
it comes down ace king five monotone
bottom versus big blind singer race part
where you should check a lot and they
just auto better third that will really
piss me off even though it's like a
single race part i shouldn't care and
they're making a mistake that will piss
me off more
than someone stacking me in a fine way
because as far as i'm concerned they
played the hand well if they stacked me
and they played it well then they
deserve the money but if they mess up
some small seabed in a single race part
i'm mad maybe not mad but i'm like
frustrated at that so it's weird
do you know what i mean
okay yeah yeah you you hold your fellow
uh fellow pros to a certain standard and
if they don't live up to the standard
and in the combination of the fact that
you're losing you're like how can i lose
to these [ __ ] monkeys you know
they're they're seabedding this ace king
five mono
which i would probably do as well so uh
oh i'm gonna get college kills next time
i'm just gonna out of bed just j j just
to tilt plenty off okay now i got your
till triggers
i mean there's a genuine strategy there
just just auto better spot you know it's
not a thing and then you'll throw me off
and then i'll just like bet into you on
the turn because i'm angry and then you
can just check shove your value easy
game
i i i do recognize this did this form of
tilt if i remember in the past like the
people
that i would say then are my most
nemesis or trigger something tilt are
usually the worst
the worst pros but i think it's also at
some point i was reflecting more to
myself like
i know that they're bad
okay and i'm not taking the max
advantage of it so the kind of the
frustration is that
i know there's more and i should really
really pound on them but i'm not doing
it sufficiently
so i'm trying to take responsibility
right does that make sense yeah i think
mine is because
yeah it does you're that definitely does
i think mine is
if you're playing a game of chess or
something where if they make a mistake
you just beat them there and then i
wouldn't be as annoyed but someone can
make a mistake and you can still just
lose
and you can lose over and over and over
again because variance is the thing so i
think if the variance factor wasn't
there i wouldn't find these mistakes so
annoying but it's the fact that they can
do that
and they can get away with it on the
short term even though long term they
should get punished which they do i
imagine but short term they can still
beat me up for that day week month and
that annoys
me right i'm curious how many people
are listening are going to take
advantage of that so if you see you're
selling a lot of unfrequent stuff you
know range bad range check board
suddenly get back into you
cool down take a deep breath listen
listen to ben here you know do a little
session with him ben ben
help me out here
i think i'm learning i'm learning a bit
about myself here just even saying that
we're a very educational podcast even
for the guests
so that's good to hear adam i'm sure
you've heard this form of
can we call it tilt before
yeah i have heard this form many times
and i would say if frustrations build
into the game there's some form of tilt
there how well you control that will
probably impact how much we would define
that as tilt and yeah it's some form of
projection bias where basically you're
holding your opponent to a certain
standards and you expect him to take a
certain line normally a line that you'll
be comfortable playing against and
you'll be able to exploit him and then
if he does something out of the ordinary
it creates this sense of frustration
like you've talked about and in just
that how can he do this and get away
with it and if you won every pot when he
did that there'd be no problem because
you'd be right awesome i get the rewards
but because you don't get the short term
rewards for that and he does there's
this double frustration because it's
almost like someone answering the quiz
wrong and getting all the all the praise
from the teachers you're like that's the
wrong answer i know the right answer why
is he getting rewarded so yeah
definitely very common and i like how
you talk about the downswing overall so
i probably had more conversations around
downswings than any other topic it's the
the kind of the go-to subject flip
players approached me for and yeah i
think kind of the biggest thing that i
see players like yourself and successful
players who come out at down swings very
often they don't make that many changes
they try to keep most of their habits
the same they normally lower some of
their playing time like you did and they
study a bit more they reach out to
people a bit more but most things stay
quite static they try to still put in
volume still keep their habits in place
still exercise still do the things that
will work in whereas those who struggle
with down swing do the opposite they go
real extreme either they'll just play
like crazy and start chasing losses or
they'll just not play at all and they'll
start studying lords and all their
habits go to [ __ ] they go to bed late
they they turn at the slobs when they
had good habits and obviously down
between that would have lasted maybe a
few weeks a month drags on for three
four months and everything starts to
crumble so yeah i like what you were
saying about most things staying static
in terms of your habits and yeah just
more studying see i think that's a
really really good lesson to anyone who
goes through a down swing don't change
many things study a bit more to build
more confidence maybe lower your playing
time because you're probably not putting
in your best volume at that time but i
think overall keep it habits static is
the way to go so yeah let's go back to
where it all began for you so you've had
a very fast poker projection through to
the high stakes and i know you started
your career in your early 20s so can you
take us back to that time when you first
started poker i know you dropped out of
school was that to uh to pursue poker
what was happening just to the start
before you before you started playing
poker professionally
no that's totally separate um i dropped
out because i was honestly
addicted to video games i had long story
but that was
13 14 15 14
years old
and
i started playing poker when i was
20. so yeah that was completely separate
i had this like
um period of doing nothing for a while
um
i went traveling in
2015 and when i got back i just didn't
want to go back to my old jobs which
were just working in an office doing
some accounts work
and i had some money saved up
so i decided that i would just kind of
take a shot at poker which honestly in
hindsight was was sincerely a terrible
idea
it was really really bad because i
didn't know anything like my
exposure to poco at that time was quite
literally playing
zynga poker on facebook and i'm not
i'm not exaggerating i had no experience
at all
and i got lucky in a few ways where i
was watching twitch streams i remember
this this um
this one time where i was playing this
also when i started playing poker
playing tournaments because i was
watching jamie stables on twitch that
was like the thing to do in my mind i
remember i was doing well in this like
440 like 4.40 psko
i had like 60 dollars in bounties and i
put in the twitch chat i was such a such
an idiot back then i put in the twitter
saying hey guys i'm doing really well in
the tournament wish me luck
this is so horrible we've been thinking
about and this this guy messaged back
saying oh here's what you should do he
gave me some beginner strategy that i
didn't even know of
and we ended up becoming
becoming friends and he kind of
leapfrogged me forward from playing
tournaments to playing six max cash um i
kind of just went from there just
picking up friends and them helping me
and just kind of just grinding it a lot
and being motivated to or at least maybe
not motivated but being just determined
to just do
the same thing and have success with it
but it was
very poor it was a poor decision in
hindsight just to kind of put all my
eggs in that basket
it sounds like a very random starting
point for starting on facebook playing
singer poker and then playing yes some
tournaments which might not be a suit to
you so what were your expectations that
time obviously there's one element where
you're trying to avoid the nine-to-five
job so i'm guessing the
early expectations might be enough money
to support yourself when you went into
the poker world what were you expecting
in that moment
well i wasn't expecting to become a
millionaire or something like i guess i
was making myself look worse than what
it was
the reality of the situation was that i
knew you could make money i wasn't
expecting to make millions but just
objectively i knew that you could make
money from playing poker and my goal was
to just not work a job because i was
really
hating that i was just hating working in
nine to five for someone else that
doesn't really care about me like
objectively i hate the idea of doing
that so my goal was to just not do that
ultimately and i knew that poker was a
way that that could happen especially
watching streamers on twitch back then
that was when twitch was really big with
pokey had jay carver and jamie staples
and
i think that's before doug pogba but
there's a lot of big streamers back then
like big big streamers
and
yeah that was my goal which was just not
not doing nine to five it wasn't
necessarily to become the best
or anything but it was just to not work
a normal job
make do buy poker instead
um
so in the beginning when we start our
poker careers we often have this very
romantic picture of playing poker
professionally when was the first time
you ran into an obstacle early in your
career that made you doubt your choice
of playing poker
i don't think i've had that from being
honest
i think um
[Music]
no i've i've got this i guess one of
one quality that i have is that i'm
really
stubborn with things
i'm either completely in or completely
out and with pogo i've always been
completely in there there's obviously
been like annoying sessions here and
there i'm like oh this is really
frustrating but i've never thought poker
was the wrong decision like now i can
look back at my career and say that i
shouldn't have gone into poker at the
time it was really really bad
but
if i'm thinking presently throughout my
career i've never thought that this was
a bad decision even now like i'm happy
that i did poker or i'm happy that i'm
in poker and i've always thought that
so no i've never had a time where i've
thought
poker is not for me
to be honest
i like that mindset they're completely
in or they're completely out i think
from i would say looking in especially
like the your decision to quit school
completely out i know you said you were
playing video games at the time i think
i'm the self-awareness to know like what
am i going to go all in with in my life
and for you it sounded like when you do
decide on that like i said you're very
stubborn but also like very committed
i'm guessing like they go kind of hand
in hand where you apply yourself to
great i'm going to make this work so uh
that all in completely and as you said
mentality sounds like it may be overcame
any of the initial doubts that a lot of
players might have uh so for yourself
like did you have any role models around
you obviously you've got these twitch
streamers who are who you're looking at
anyone in your immediate circle or
anyone you reached out to in the early
days that give you a bit of hope that
you could sue poker further
um
yeah i think that
i'm not sure about right at the start
maybe right at the site it was the j it
was jamie staples on twitch
um then i said i met that guy and i
started playing cash i think i
looked up to a guy maybe you know of him
renee uh martin c you must have played
against him lots
the the the nickname
yeah he was a uh 200 500 zoom grinder
back in like 2015 or 2016 probably 2016
and he was um posting a pretty
successful blog in two plus two and just
posting these crazy hand histories and
really nice graphs and this was back
when i was playing 10 or 16 or 25 now
and i'm not sure i must have asked him
to add me on skype and for some reason
he said yes and he kind of just gave me
advice but just the fact that he
even um
exposed himself to me that sounds
terrible saying that um but like you
know he he didn't he answered a few hand
histories
he answered a few industries gave me
some bankroll management advice
told me that you know it's not is not so
hard these guys who are doing really
well are not that good and you can
definitely do that just that kind of
made me believe that i could do it
so i'd say i definitely looked up to him
because he was a guy he had made in my
mind again i wasn't aspiring to become
like a guy playing
20k now
it was just i wanted to become a 200
zoom and 500 zoom player
and he was doing that and he was
actually he was doing very well from i
remember and he told me that i could do
that so i would say it was him and
now um i would say the only guy i would
look up to would be probably like linus
because i think he's
he plays an approach similar to mine in
terms of this he's quite theoretical
obviously he does exploits here and
there but he definitely bases everything
around theory and he's the best at it in
my opinion so now it'll be him i think
there's the only two people i can think
of that i'd look up to in the poker
world
yeah perfect and you started out playing
mtt's and i think you had a period of
career where you played heads up and
then what made you transition to six max
ring games what was the kind of
transition period for you
well i went tournaments for like
a few months
and then i quit that
pretty sure if i look at my shark scope
it's just like a crashing line going
down
um when i started doing that
and then i started playing cash from i
would say like november 2015 all the way
through until now and heads up came
i'm thinking around 2018
it honestly it came around because i was
bored of c i was bored of playing six
max it was just
same monotonous grind of playing i was
also playing 100 gym and 200 zoom where
it's the same grind every day so i
started playing heads up just because i
was something different and now i'm
still playing heads up um i do both i'm
i depends on what the games run
sometimes the heads up lobbies are
non-existent there's nothing running
other days i display heads up only so
i'm now just a heads up slash ring cash
game player and i don't play any
tournaments
so you've had quite a
fast rise for the poker rankings and
other than being someone who's quite
stubborn and do something kind of go
completely all in with something what
are some of the traits that you think
may have allowed you to uh pick a poker
quite quickly you might not realize that
yourself you might not classify yourself
as a quick learner there's any kind of
skills or traits about yourself that on
reflection have made you a good suit for
poker
um well
i think
firstly
it's like
i moved from it took me
four years to get from nothing to one
knl which i don't think super fast and
there's definitely players out there who
did it in half the time
um and and i think a lot of that is down
to some people just cap themselves at a
certain stake some people are just doing
very very well at 50 now or 100 now
particularly the zoom pools like they're
doing what a 50 zoom or 100 zoom and
they just limit themselves to just being
a player at that stake
and they don't move up so
i think firstly it's just i allowed
myself to move up i didn't set this as
my cap i just kept on moving until i
felt like i wasn't
one of the better players
um and secondly maybe honestly it might
just come down to firstly like i said
the the
not capping myself and then
always just
happy with what i'm doing i never
thought that poker wasn't the thing to
do it was always this is still
reasonable i'm still having fun i'm
still enjoying it i definitely prefer to
do this than a normal job
um
yeah apart from that i don't think i
have any any innate attributes to like
when people say like you need to be good
at numbers or you need to be good with
psychology or things like that maybe in
other other forms of poker like life
poke or something but online i don't
think you need to be a math wiz to be a
very successful poker player i think you
just need to be consistent and
determined
and believe in yourself as well if you
if you're having doubts and then you're
not playing higher stakes then that's
obviously gonna that's gonna hinder you
where did that initial belief come from
for you so i think we talked about this
mean running off the air where goose
call was basically saying in a previous
podcast that he always needed to see a
nice pretty graph before moving up
stakes to give him that kind of
reassurance and confidence that he was
beating the games it seems like for you
potentially you've moved up a bit
quicker definitely a bit quicker than
the average um you seem to have had
confidence and not having much
self-doubt so where do you think that
initial confidence to move upstairs and
not cap yourself has come from
i don't know i feel like that's just
part of me um so i can't really
i definitely especially heads up there
are some guys and heads up that i am
outclassed by
and that feels bad knowing that i'm just
losing against this guy
but i don't really have that in
six-handed maybe i'm just delusional but
i feel like the only way i wouldn't have
confidence is if someone's just doing
things better than me which does happen
um but i need i need to feel like i'm
out performing someone more than they
are performing me for me to just have
the confidence so i guess what i do is i
just start feeling confident as as a
get-go so if i move up to a new stake
i'm feeling good and then if i just kind
of get overrun by good plays i would
then think okay moving back down that
did happen once in my career i remember
i don't know the year now um
yeah actually i do so at the end of 2016
i was playing 50 now
and i had like a one big blind win rate
over fifty thousand hands i remember
because it was in my blog
and despite having you know not much
basic i wasn't losing at fit over 50 000
hands and at the start of the next year
i moved back down to 25 because i didn't
feel confident i felt like i was just
winging it and and
getting lucky so that was the only time
in my career where i moved down
based on not feeling like i was adequate
um to to play that stake
otherwise i've never moved down
based on that i've only ever moved down
on on fading a shot or something so i
feel like i i have that innate
confidence and then unless i get proven
otherwise by people outperforming me
then i just keep on doing what i'm doing
i love that
it's often the inverse of what i see in
a lot of players i think a lot of
players when they start playing a new
stake they instantly assume they're
going to be outclassed they instantly
assume the player pool is going to be
really tough and even before the cards
being dealt they're starting to go oh
here we go this is going to be
challenging whereas you because the work
you put in because the consistency you
put into your game you you go in there
very confident and go right prove me
wrong prove me wrong that i shouldn't be
confident in this game so yeah i like
that it's a very like you said it's just
a part of you so it's really hard to
like kind of dissect where it comes from
yeah i really think it's a good lesson
to be able to learn just to build
confidence in advance and obviously when
you move up stakes you don't have a
graph to show for it you don't have any
results at that level but you know what
work you put into your game and until
the level proves that it's too hard for
you a player starts i'll play on you a
lot why not start confidence and i think
it's a very common trait among
successful players they almost start
confident first then they get gets
reinforced by results later whereas
other players who struggle to move
upstairs often need more reassurance in
the short term they often can't move
stakes because they lack their
confidence and yeah it becomes like an
obstacle so yeah really really good and
i think that's one of the things i'm
picking away from you already that's
allowed you to move mistakes quickly
having confidence initially so yeah
really good
renee have you got any questions on
confidence okay
yeah go look
i just wanna say one more thing on that
because um when you were speaking i i
thought of something else so i think the
reason why i'm confident when i move up
is that if you start playing a new state
you've got no data for it the only data
that you have
is your past success so i feel like if
you don't have that confidence you're
almost doing yourself an injustice there
so i think that's probably the reason
why is that you've got that as long as
you don't maybe if you just deposit
money to play that stake or something
it's different but if you move up to
that stake based on your past results
then i don't see why you wouldn't feel
confident to be honest so i think that's
probably where mine comes from it's just
objectively thinking right i've played
this lower stake and i've done well
enough to build the bankroll to move up
therefore i'm going to feel confident my
new stake the only thing i did make i
always made this mistake even though i
didn't presume they're going to be
better than me i always presumed these
regs at the higher stake to be really
aggressive that was the one thing i
always made the mistake of was oh this
is my first hand at my first grind at
100 zoom these guys gonna be three
betting me and forbidding me and five
betting me and check raising flopping
that's that's definitely delusion so if
you're a guy moving up to a new stake
and you think these guys are really
aggressive
they might be ever so slightly more
aggressive but not to the extent where
you're now forbidding a new hand in your
range because someone is through about
you because they don't know who you are
and they're distilled through but in
their static ranges and then you're
exploiting yourself so that's the only
thing i did make the mistake of
yeah we had a dude on our podcast
two episodes ago and he had a similar
kind of experience where he said his
most most um best advice for anyone
moving upstairs would be just play solid
play a normal game don't go in there
thinking everyone's going to be firing
bullets and check raising you and
playing all aggressive just play solid
and yeah i think it's similar for you
where you make an assumption without
kind of a data point that people are
going to be more aggressive and as a
result you probably deviate your game a
lot go for fancy players and before you
know it you're playing a game that
you're not really comfortable with when
yeah there's no really no need for it
yeah i think it's really interesting i
do feel like it isn't the most common
mindset to have confidence in advance i
work with the player at the moment who
had a great best month he's ever had in
his life and he was moving up sticks and
within a few weeks his confidence was
really really low he wasn't even losing
he's kind of breaking even at the new
sticks but the story he was telling
himself was these games are hard i
haven't got a track record of these
everyone's got a lot better already it's
like you haven't got a sample to prove
that so it's i think it's really good to
have the confidence in advance and go
actually i'm going to look at the only
data point i have which is these results
which is the lower stake and until i
built a sample of this new stick i'm not
going to judge and i'm going to assume
i'm a good player so yeah i think it's a
very strong mindset i think it's uh
definitely not as common as yeah as the
opposite approach so yeah good stuff
all right renee if you're going to
follow up questions on confidence or
anything we've talked about so far
there's this great book called the
confidence gap i don't know if you know
it adam
i don't
they talk about that the act of
confidence comes first and the feeling
comes after and that's kind of what
luke's story makes me think of he takes
the jump right which requires confidence
and then from there he starts to feel
confident because he beats the game
whereas a lot of players they kept
themselves partly also because of fear
right i loved the way you explained they
tell a certain story in their head
before they moved up so they haven't
played let's say you play 15 l zoom they
haven't played 100 zoom yet but before
they play they've already said so much
stories they're better there and all
kind of reason why they're not going to
beat it
that they didn't even jump in there in
the first place
whereas luke didn't tell him the story
he's like okay i'm gonna jump in right
and get data and then make and then
adjust from there right and then there
was this one time where he felt like he
had to move back
but at least he tried and that takes
confidence right and a lot of people are
just afraid
to take that step so
yeah i mean luke talks about it in a
very normal way like hey yeah listen
this is this is how the world this is
how the world works right but yeah i
think a lot of players a lot of players
struggle with that
when you
you mentioned that you took the shot at
1500 then you moved back
what was something
in your game
that
you felt like you had to change or what
was something that had to click in order
for you to move through
that only barrier so far that you've
described i don't remember actually so
that was
um
26 like december 20 i remember i moved
up november or december of 2016. i
played 50 000 hands then moved back down
at the start of 2017.
i don't remember what
made me not feel confident maybe i
wasn't playing tough enough
i'm not sure there was something and i
said it only happened once so something
put me off where i felt like i was i was
not it might have just been like i said
the metric of i think i'm getting
outclassed more than i'm outclassing
them but i'm not sure where
um i did end up
like i said playing 25 l
having good results and then moving back
up and i never looked back after that
but yeah i'm not sure exactly what i was
pinpointing my mind to say these guys
are better than me
maybe a few things it could also
obviously just be uh you know over the
short sample you were put in very
unfrequent spots where you kind of you
didn't see the showdown but you felt
like uh they they probably owned me or
whatever you understand that that you
didn't get the confirmation uh
you know you're still human right
so
yeah that can happen you also actually
mentioned that
i actually thought you came from hud's
up and then moved to six max but you
actually played six max then you got a
little bit bored of it and then jumped
into a little bit of a heads up what
were some of the
adjustments you had to make moving from
six megs to heads up
you just got to get your hands dirty you
can't you can't play you know in in six
specs you're gonna get the 2017
eight guys you know vpfr three bet and
then you get the 25 29 guys and you get
your 30 20 10 guys you've got different
samples of players in heads up everyone
plays static mostly everyone plays
static ranges pre-flop which is wide and
you got you got a 3-bet more than 20 you
got a v-pip around 80
so you just got to get your hands dirty
um definitely it
allows you sorry to be really aware of
blockers and suit properties because
you're playing so many offsuit hands
whereas you're playing in a tight
six-pack environment like under the gun
versus big blind you're not having so
many off-suit hands so the suits aren't
that important it's just like oh we've
got two clubs versus two diamonds
whereas an off-suit lands in heads-up
it's very very precise so i think it
really allows you to
get better at the game of poker i
wouldn't necessarily recommend someone
to get into heads-up but i would say
that if you're invested into your future
so let's say you want to um play poker
for a long time i do think heads up is a
good inve and good investment not to
make short term money but to have a good
understanding of the game i think heads
up players are better in my opinion
heads up players are better players than
ring game players
in my opinion
all right now that i i do see where you
come from you mean mainly then
theoretical as well
uh mainly theoretical because i can
imagine in ring games you might be
better at
understanding sort of the dynamic
multi-way pots with fish how does the
fish where is he at the table how can
that impact my strategy how does that
improve my win rate it's because also
what you said right if you're playing
heads up you have to make money from the
guy you're playing against you cannot be
like ah i'll not play so much against
for example in six max let's say for
example we have a table there's uh one
recreational three bad wrecks plenty and
me
then i'm gonna be like okay
why would i look up small edges against
clanty when there's three bat racks and
a fish there's no point there's no point
in me but if i'm saying that heads up
can play heads up against clinton i'm
not gonna worry about the small edges
obviously i'll get overrun
yeah well firstly thanks for not
including me as one of the bad regs i
appreciate that um
and
yeah i actually i agree you're right
there's definitely different dynamics in
heads up you're not thinking about the
multi-way spot so maybe i i guess it's
subjective
definitely the theory side of it with
the blockers and unblockers but like you
say that's not the whole picture of
poker so yeah probably actually i take
back what i said because there's more to
poker than just blockers and unblockers
obviously so
i would say that let's say this if
you're playing in a reg only environment
in six-handed um i would say if you have
heads-up experience it will really help
you in that environment but then if
you're playing with two recreations on
the table and then a heads-up player
joins the heads-up player is probably
not going to be experienced in
what his deviations are going to be
so then
what do you think are some common
mistakes that you see
heads up players make when they do join
a ring game
they are stronger maybe from a
theoretical side but obviously you know
you suddenly play i don't know small
black versus big blind out of position
right it doesn't really doesn't really
happen
we all play too wide it's like a
a real consistent theme is
like over over v pip everywhere um well
over everywhere pre-flop so they open
too wide and they defend through bits
too wide
without yeah i'm not going to name any
names but there's a few guys who play
heads up in six max who are primary
heads up players and whenever they play
six packs they always just play too
loose they kind of they get they're the
guy who would open queen 10
off so on the button but then they would
defend the three bits some of the time
because in heads up blind it's like snap
continue and then in six max is a bit
tighter but it's actually a lot tighter
and then you obviously just followed
you'd even fold queen jack and yeah
that's the kind of just common mistake
that i would see but there's not many
heads up players so you don't really get
many of them joining six max you know
typically the guys who play heads up
just play heads up and you don't see
them in the ring game streets
i guess then the opposite is more common
that you're playing heads up and then
you see six max guys jump into a
heads-up pool
uh yeah sometimes you get a pool where i
mean on pokerstars all of it's just
heads up presume and sometimes you'll
get a pool running and then it gets even
bigger you've got like let's say three
or four recreationals and you've got a
pool of 20 and then you get a bunch of
the six max guys joining uh because
obviously they're making money with the
amount of recreations in there and
yeah that's more common than the i can
only think of like
two or three heads up guys who ever
actually play six max but there's a
bunch of six max guys who play heads up
occasionally
and then the the six max guy joins into
the heads up most com most common
problem or leak that they have is not
getting their hands dirty enough i guess
yeah that but only slightly i feel like
the guys who um
[Music]
maybe i'm wrong here but i think if if a
six max player joins heads up he always
is going to be aware of the ranges i
don't think anyone just jumps into heads
up without studying ranges so i think
they do pretty good at getting dirty
with their hands but they don't
understand the nuances so what they
might have done is they might have
studied the ranges so they might be
three betting you know over 20
which is fine but then they don't
understand the nuances what happens post
flop where they might there might be
like a certain board
that they play a lot differently in
heads up or they're supposed to but then
they don't
so that would be a mistake is that it is
understudied
yeah the range interactions obviously uh
are completely
completely different i guess this is
also very hard for heads-up players that
you know it's every time you have
different ranges and as what you already
said they might come in with the game
okay we have to play a little bit
tighter but no you have to play a lot
tighter especially in like these
knittier positions ep mp yeah you you
just cannot play around like playing
around with too much hands in tight
positions just costs you money it's just
a fact
yeah exactly there's no two ways about
it i think i i think it was uh what's
his name
kevin rabbi ciao i think i heard him
saying in in a podcast that he was
trying to study amputees but the way he
was studying heads up cash couldn't be
transitioned into the into studying
entities because he would go very deep
into
very small nuances in spots because
there's a limited amount of spots but
then i mean if you already think about
six packs cash you have different
positions that you have to study so you
cannot go as in depth and think about
tournaments you then have
even more positions more stack sizes how
do you
study
heads up differently than six max
a heads up this is studied the same way
in my opinion um it's just you just
become way more accurate because there
is only three situations maybe a few
more if you're playing against guy who
limps slash being deeper pre-flop but
even then it it's all heads up zoom so
you can just roll if you want to you
just sit out 150 blinds and it's fine
so i would say my my
study process is the same i'm just like
running my sims creating aggregation
reports
playing against the trainers you know
the gta trainings that you can do with
your own sims that's my kind of study
process
um so it's the same and then with
tournaments yeah i don't play
tournaments i think and i i have been
thinking about
adding them into my ground i think then
it's just completely different your your
studying process has to be less finite
and more just about understanding lots
of different spots you know when you're
starting starting to include icm and
well just only icm and then different
stack sizes playing multi-way it has to
just be less finite like less less um
nuances oh there's like a heuristic here
on this kind of board it's like well
actually now you're playing against
different stack sizes different amounts
of players in the hands it's just less
heuristics more just general
solid gameplay i don't think you can
really be accurate with mtt's i just
there's just so many spots to be playing
i don't think you can really be good at
any of them just gotta be kind of okay
in my mind maybe i'm wrong
i think this is also very important
mentally going in that you're not going
in to try to find the same accuracy as
that you had when playing heads up or
even even six max cache and kind of
more deal with the un more uncertainty
and
accept that you won't be as precise and
that you are going to make more mistakes
yeah um it's similar to actually going
back to an earlier point where you said
where did my confidence come from like
i'm usually confident until i get proven
otherwise
actually now with heads up i've kind of
given up
playing heads up against the regs who
only play heads up because i'm just
fighting a a battle that i can't win you
know i'm playing
something like 70 30 in favor of six max
so if only 30 of my times going into
heads up how can i play against a guy
who's doing 100 of his time into heads
up so i've given up that battle a while
ago um i can't compete against those
guys who only play heads up and um yeah
and then in tournaments if you're going
to be playing all these different spots
i think you just got to go in into the
session with the mindset of i'm not
going to play perfect i'm not going to
be playing every spot to the you know in
when you're playing high-stakes cash you
should really not be making eevee errors
and just mixing errors because ev areas
are pretty costly and you should be
better than that most of the time
whereas in tournaments i think you're
just making eevee errors everywhere
and that's just part of the game because
there's just so many different spots you
know we as humans can't really get to
the point of zero ev and only they're
making frequency mistakes in tournaments
at least consistently because you're
just playing so many different stack
sizes and then you've got the icm coming
into it as well i just can't see it i
can't see a human being good enough to
do that
yeah it's it's insanely com
insanely complex and even in cash
actually i always have the model of
poker is a game of mistakes and in order
to win you have to make less mistakes in
your opponent you don't have to play
perfect right
uh
and that's also like you can add certain
game selection here and yeah okay you
make a lot of mistakes and play against
guys who even make more mistakes than
you you know shout out to the to the
zinc poker on facebook right a little
bang bang here
i'm sure you've uh you you've crushed a
couple of guys there
uh you mentioned you're just not even
gonna try right to beat these heads up
guys because obviously they only
dedicated their time to heads up what is
it then about the gap difference that
that extra
time that they put into a heads up why
do you then fall behind what do they do
with that extra time that gives them an
edge over you
well like you just said poker is a game
of mistakes
and who makes the less mistakes and i
just wasn't seeing mistakes in their
game so i didn't give up before trying i
definitely did try and there's i don't
know if you know but in the heads-up
world there's basically just a crew of
guys um from scandinavia
um
there's like six or seven of them maybe
and they're all just really good and i
played against a few of them
and just wasn't seeing mistakes so
then i stopped because i wasn't i i was
making some mistakes you know i'm pretty
good at heads up i don't make that many
mistakes but they in my mind they're
playing a better game than i was they
were making less mistakes the sports i
was playing well they were playing well
spots that i was making some mistakes
they weren't making mistakes
so that's kind of what made that that
just packed it in for me i was like i'm
not playing against a guy who isn't
making the mistakes i'm making more than
him what's the point and then also i'm
not even fully invested into heads up
anyway so let's say i did want to
start batting him with him battling and
making less mistakes i'm still playing
mostly six max anyway so what's the
point
you know i'm not going to become a heads
up only player because the heads-up game
is just dying slowly but surely so it
makes more sense for me just to focus on
six max
yeah the remember the old saying if you
cannot spot the fish they hear the fish
so you have your heads up
you don't see any mistakes of your
opponent then it's very likely uh yeah
that you are the one who is behind so
good self-reflection there also i spot
no no ego whatsoever it's just like yeah
okay well they're better than me they
invest more time with me that's
something that they want to do okay i'll
move on and focus on six max games so
again i think it's a a very good
if we can call it mindset that you have
here uh you also mentioned like many you
know solvers are a big part of your
studying
process i think
when you started playing poker
you started out straight away with the
solver because it was out there like for
example i've been playing poke for over
10 years in the beginning of my career
there was no sulfur so we had sort of
the transition area but when you started
out it was solver straight from the
start
not quite no
um i
got a solver in
2017 sometime in that year
i think
and well definitely 2017 might have been
the end of 2016.
and
right before then i was just kind of
doing my own thing studying hand
histories the old-fashioned way and
equilibrium and things like that
um i've after the solve i think i've
said this before on um the run it once
elite cool
um but i
only
have had success in poker in my mind
down to well when i say success i mean
like high stakes success uh down to
solvers because i don't believe that i'm
a good poker player in terms of for
example you've been playing poker for 10
years and you had success way before
soldiers i remember seeing your screen
name
before solvers were a thing
um i wouldn't have been a player like
yourself who made it before solvers
because i don't think i had the ability
to do that i am really good at being a
huge geek and just kind of like nerding
out in this over and then having success
from that
so
i did have a brief period of playing
without solvers but then solvers really
kicked it off for me that's what made me
a
i went from 25 50 up to 1k in a couple
years because i just understood the
solver more than my own
pre-solver game you know my pre-solver
game was basically if they check i bet
kind of strut it was just super super
high red line that was my innate style
it wasn't very good it was pretty it was
uh it wasn't it wasn't elegant at all
yeah i think i think you needed
yeah a different
set of skills i guess before like i said
i think before we recorded i said that
creativity is always been one of my
strengths so i could creatively think
about strategies i would think about
ways
to make ev and then later it turned out
when the solver came out that all of my
strategies were gto right i understood
how they made ev the solver does the
same obviously there were many where
that was not the case okay
uh
in your opinion like you said that
console has contributed a lot to your
success i have to say
my breakthrough towards higher stakes
was also when i started to use more
solvers but this was also a combination
in i was playing against tougher
opponents who would also use a lot of
solvers and i was always the type who
learned a lot from playing against
my opponent so i was
even though i wasn't that much into
solvers i used solvers more i would say
when i started the cfp and started
coaching people
because i could present the evidence
that what i was saying was right so i
often use the solver to sort of make my
point you know it's like yeah you see
the solver also agrees with me so he has
the authority people listen to what the
solver says right
um
in your opinion
what are some common mistakes
that people make and how could they
better use a solver in order to just
like you move up to 1k within a year
by far the biggest mistake that people
use and solvers and this is this is a
real i mean there's gonna be people
listening to this who are doing this and
i hope they um take this advice is run
your sims to a static nature
i.e
run your sims with the same spr
and the same ranges don't change your
range
or don't change the spr to the hand
because then you kind of come into mtt
land where it's just infinitely complex
so have a set of pre-solves that are
static and if you happen to three bet a
bit too big or a bit too small then okay
just part of life you can nothing is
going to be perfect
so learn from one set of sims big one
but let's say big blind first button in
a three bit pop have one set of sims
don't have
i mean an infinite set of sims where
basically your research is running the
sim at the time and you're just doing
the exact spr the exact range you
think's happening are you three betting
too tight because he's under opening or
is he overthrowed into three bets and
then you're over wide and then your
range is not doing very well postal
because he's got a tight range and
you've got a wide range and then the all
the heuristics are different don't do
that have one sim and then learn learn
the heuristic to that sim
that's that's um by far and away the
biggest takeaway i think someone can can
learn from using solvers
yeah because
that approach is more i'm trying to
figure out what i have to do in this
exact hand that i was dealt where you're
using the solver more
as okay add a solver place gto i'm
trying to understand gto the solver
shows a game that is based on gto so i
can learn from that you're using you're
using more static
ranges the same ranges the same spots
you look for heuristics like okay how
does gto play
in in the solver
yeah if you want to learn how to play
the spot in of itself
then
you either don't use a solver and go
into other different different softwares
where you can load lock
more effectively or
use the static sim and then be creative
post that so i don't i don't really see
a world where you should just use a sim
that's live to the spot you should
either just use like flopzilla or
echolab and just quite literally go into
an excel sheet and count combos right if
you're on the river or something or use
the static sim and then be creative
after that
i think either method is gonna be better
than creating a one-off sim that you
just basically delete afterward and if
you rinse repeat that process you will
still improve because ultimately you're
still working but you're not going to
improve as fast as somebody else who
first he doesn't have to rerun this sim
because he's got the one sim there
that's waiting for him in the library
but also he will learn heuristics more
because these heuristics are consistent
over the boards they're not just you
know one time playing with a five sp
other time you're playing with the three
spr and everything just changes at that
point if you start when you start
getting good at poki you realize that
you change one thing in a sim and it
might not completely backflip itself but
it will definitely change to an extent
that your strategy should should shift
so i don't i don't play to that where
i'm creating a different sim each time
yeah unless obviously understanding the
impact spr has on your strategy is your
goal of your research right then by all
means run the same spot 50 bb 150 bb 100
bb and see what changes right if you i'm
i'm a big fan of trying to
study which variables shift the
strategies what was the determining
factor right some some exactly what you
just said sometimes you change something
and it doesn't really change much but
when you change one thing you change one
card or you change the spc spr to a
certain point where suddenly the
strategy flips and in that in my opinion
is a major concept that you should learn
and build your game around and
especially like we talked about right in
mtt's this kind of way of studying is
going to be way
more crucial as you're gonna get into so
much spots where you don't exactly know
what to do but you're just gonna use the
heuristics you have about how to play
recently gto to figure the spot out as
you go right
yeah yeah if your research is nuanced
like you said like spi research
um then yeah definitely then that then
you want to play around in different
ways but if your
goal for the time being or goal at that
point is just to learn how to play this
board um or big blind versus button then
you should have these uh these presolds
i've also done the um research that
you're talking about of the spr and
things like that it's very interesting
especially if you start if you start
using like toy game models and you start
playing with them like for example if
you're playing a three bit part but then
you're like 500 big blinds effective
it's really interesting to see what the
solver does it's um not what
i was thinking anyway where i was
thinking oh you can just like rush money
in because you've got really good hands
it's like no
everything is super super passive it's
like massive game of uh
who can check the most almost that's
what it seems like when you're playing
super super deep
yeah i mean you can see that right take
a tournament spot where you're playing
40 bb
that spot you know you have a lot of
already open jams in 100b you know you
have that
exactly on a jack 10x
to to space or something but when you go
deeper than it you don't open gem
anymore it's not a thing right or in
honeybee we still want to big on certain
flops so we might get it in in the turn
but yeah then when you're 500 big bands
deep and you bet very big then the guy
calls the shitty turquoise so you should
still afford a bb left good luck so yeah
it's definitely something to take in
consideration and indeed usually the
deeper you come and especially when
you're out of position
yeah you cannot really deny
your opponent from seeing the river
right
or at least without destroying your
equity when called uh we had a podcast
with bennet babbitt
uh earlier you mentioned you guys study
together as well and benna has been
playing just like me poker already for a
very long time
um
the pre the pre-solver age
so to say we we were winning players at
the pre-solver aged he also mentioned
that
if you come from the pre-solver age that
does have some benefits
mainly
in playing versus recreational players
he thought that all the school players
are better in that
what do you think are some benefits that
you for example see that ben has
because he he was already winning player
pre-solver age and how do you
see yourself playing against
recreationals
yeah i completely agree guys who are
from pre-solvers
just have a better idea of how to
um
think outside of a solver so without
relying on that they just have a better
like better intuition better creativity
i mean often
ben benemies send each other hands um
not daily but almost and if i ever send
him a hand nine times out of ten is
against the recreational should i have
done this how would you play the streets
that kind of stuff because ben's the man
to ask about how to play against
recreationals he's just he's an expert
he's very very good
um
so yeah i would say
they are better than that or better at
that
um and what's the second part of the
question sorry i completely mind
blanking
the second part of the question what do
you think are some
other skills that for example a player
like ben picked up pre-solver age
that
contributes still contributes to his
success in modern name poker
that you can learn from for example
um
i i think it depends on the games you're
playing in as well because if you're
playing for example i try to play
the pokestars games mainly and then a
bit of acr and party um where the games
are pretty tough and i would say then
the pre-solver era doesn't really give
you many advantages like if playing if
you're playing a four-handed 2k reg
battle on stars i don't think you're
going to get much advantage from being a
pre-solver guy
but then if you're playing on acr and
there's two recreations on the table
then he's just very good at i think he
just opens his game up to being
he's very um
like i think i'm a reactionary player
where i'll wait for something to happen
and i'll try and react to it where he's
just thinking ahead and he's thinking
right this guy you've got the guy in the
blinds and then the guy on the button
and he's got that he's going to either
open too wide or open wide or
defend wide or just do so he's basically
kind of curating the game plan on the
fly whereas i'm
not doing that and then i'm paying the
consequence of reacting to it whereas
he's kind of going at them if that makes
sense so i think he's just very aware of
the differences in game flow when the
game is going from a reg battle to
anything but that he's very good at
playing in the wild west as we say
oh yeah i can i can i can very strongly
relate to that i would say that that is
a skill of mine as well because imagine
pre-solver h you didn't have
like i mean if you face a bet you didn't
really know what to do there was no set
game plan you didn't know what was
correct so you were always trying to
figure out okay what's going to happen
how does this guy play how can i exploit
that nowadays we are way more focused on
okay what is our range how does our
range want to play like a bit more
you could say sort of defensive poker
i'm trying to play a solid strategy you
make deviations therefore i win whereas
in the past was you really had to hunt
people down for money so you were
constantly looking at how can i make
money at this table how can i exploit
this opponent you were constantly trying
to invent lines so you're constantly
trying to figure out what do you have
and how can i make the correct decision
versus that which is a train of thought
that i think a lot of modern day players
they kind of miss
yeah i mean i get this a lot in heads up
where i'm playing as a recreational
and
i mean there are times so i i i'm doing
this approach currently versus
recreationals where i'm
uh opening forex
uh because i'm just trying to put more
money into the pot but honestly
sometimes i just lose myself
because i don't like i i i'm very good
at understanding a game plan that's
structured so with the solver and then
when it comes to making this thing on my
own
i'm not very good at it and that's where
i think if if ben was here and he was
creating a game plan he could just in 10
minutes create a game plan you know
basic one fl that's what i'm doing on
flop that's what i'm doing on terms is
what i'm doing on rivers and i feel like
it would take me either days or i'd just
be unable to do it because i just don't
have that skill set you know i would at
that point just need to um almost hire
him as a
recreational or like a coach to help me
play against recreation because i just
don't really have that mindset like i
said i don't think i'm a good poker
player i think i'm good at solvers and
that's indirectly helped me with poker
but when it comes down to the basics of
uh
you know how to play poker i don't think
i'm actually very good at that i think
i'm just very fortunate that we have
solvers to to help us
yeah you're not great at inventing
strategies but then when ben beat makes
the strategy he invents the strategy
then he shows you which is sort of what
the solver does but in this case ben
does that against recreationals you are
easily when you have the final results
you can interpret that and you see like
oh that's how it works now i understand
it but you cannot create it out of the
blues like where do i where do i start
i've always made strategies
based on i know the end results and
trying to understand it
yeah exactly i don't have the brain like
my brain doesn't work that way
it just doesn't i have my mind will
blank i just instead of it taking some
time i just i'm unable to
kind of get my head around it my brain
is more of a
like i believe that
there are different
models that your brain can work under so
you've kind of got like a
um a scientist an artist an engineer
um a logician if that's a word or like a
logicist i'm not sure um different
different frameworks that your mind can
work under and mine or maybe like
creative mind as well or that might
become an artist and my work my my mind
is just very very very logical and i'm
good with that and then when it comes to
being creative or even like an engineer
side of the brain where you're just
you've got like a lot of moving parts
and you've got to say okay here's moving
parts how do you put them together
right i don't know
i'm good at understanding the engine and
then seeing how it works because that's
the logical side of it i can't put
things together i'm just i'm really
really
poor at that
my little thinking skills are just
terrible
but ben is the opposite ben is extremely
i mean impressive if you're doing hand
disreviews he's just like he just nails
it he understands what's going on and
yeah it's to him it's intuitive to me
it's anything but
so definitely different skill sets yeah
i i remember also when i had students or
something and we would talk about more
exploitation and i would show i don't
know certain stats on a certain player
and to me it was like listen it's quite
obvious right yes that leak is deadly so
that means that we're going to do this
that pop up and they're like okay where
the [ __ ] do i even start watching what
do these numbers mean how how will that
impact my strategy but with me if i see
three
stats that are outside of the average i
immediately know like okay yeah we're
gonna just that way the spell is gonna
play out this way he's gonna do that so
it leaves you more with this and then
bomb strategy
it's super intuitive because that's what
i've been doing my whole life is this
because i know you're very gto oriented
or at least in the videos that i've
watched of you
there's basically only gto
considerations is this also then
because that's your strength do you kind
of stay away from the exploit desktop on
purpose to
remain within your strengths
well i definitely exploit um videos on
reddit once and elsewhere are very
deliberately gto because that's what i'm
working toward as a theme
there are definitely exploits coming in
against regulars but i would say one i
do try to
limit that
and two i don't think i'm very good at
that so
if i'm let's say let's say you me and
another reg are playing three-handed and
we're all good
there will be exploits coming in my game
but i'd imagine you would firstly
outperform me at exploits and also you
would just do more of them too so i feel
like you would have a higher frequency
and and just higher roi for each one
that you do
that makes sense and also one more thing
as well so i think like as
as like an analogy i'm really good at
making a hud for example my poker hud is
really really good in my mind
but then i failed to read it i failed to
read all these stats that i've got on
them and then actually create a game
plan against that you know i took all of
the effort of creating all of these
custom stats and a really really
powerful kit but then
i'm not somebody who can actually read
that and then create a game plan from
that whereas i think if i were to show
you my hud and then you would see a few
step profiles and villains you know
immediately like you said you would just
think of okay well if this spot comes up
then do this obviously and i'm like oh
really so that would be the difference
is that i can create a really good hud
but then i can't even use it as
effectively as someone like you can
where it's just intuitive to you
yeah i think this is also you know it's
part of the learning process uh if you
start using huds in the beginning you
just think like oh yeah cousteau status
that but they have other says you're
like okay now what and then at some
point you realize for example in my in
my hut i only have stats displayed
that
if too high or too low make me make an
adjustment if if a status just there and
i'm not going to make an adjustment when
it in my case turns red or green which
means out of the ordinary in either to
the right or to the left
i'm gonna make an adjustment and i find
especially colors in huds very useful
because i like to then talk about red
players and green players green players
usually stats turn green when they are
over folding or under aggressive and red
they turn red when they're underfolding
and over aggressive so then you get red
players green players that's kind of the
profile then you know okay if i'm
playing versus a villain who's green
okay he's usually more passive and
overfolding that means my money is being
made by being aggressive and when he's
aggressive i fought the other guy is the
opposite right i'm gonna try to not be
as aggressive because you know my fault
equity is less and when he's aggressive
i'm gonna be extra aggressive or at
least less willing to fold and more
willing to rebluff for example that's
just a general
yeah gameplay but i think you know once
you start working more with hudson
thinking more exploitative i mean i've
also had points where i just had an
infinite number of stats displayed where
i was like yeah okay actually it doesn't
really contribute because i don't use
half of them
right and this is also for example if i
learn theory and i learned that oh this
is actually a spot where
um
for example take to use a practical
example the imposition three better his
c bet percentage if he's tree betting
from mp2 button should be different than
his street betting big blind to small
blind okay
so if i then know
if someone is tree betting or c betting
the same frequencies on all spots
by having that stat i can then exploit
that tendency right
that's kind of then
how it works
so
i think that stat actually contributes
to my strategy because if it's too high
i can exploit him by for example check
raising his c bets more right so that's
an example of having a stat that
actually
if too high or too low makes you make an
adjustment
this podcast is brought to you by poker
ambition where me and adam have created
our coaching program the mechanics of
poker after having reached high sex
poker ourselves we tested out this
philosophy on our cfp students which saw
them rise through the ranks and doubled
their win rate we then took the best
knowledge of that cfp program and turn
it into the mechanics of poker so you
can have that high quality content
without the long-term commitment and
often hefty price that comes with a cfp
program now i will be teaching you the
technical side of how poker really works
how to think about the game and how to
consistently get better and adam focuses
on the mindset and performance skills
you need to know in order to convert all
that technical poker knowledge into more
consistent profits at the table now this
program is high level it's made for
professional poker players who have the
ambition to break free from mid stakes
and move up to high 6 poker so if you're
ambitious about your poker goals go over
to
pokerambition.com for more information
and there you can also find a free one
hour demo of everything that is inside
the program if you have any further
questions don't hesitate to reach out
but without further ado let's get back
to more goodness in this episode
all right adam i remember plenty a
little bit earlier talked about
different ways of thinking or that we
have different
ways that we approach i think he talked
about the artist the engineer the more
logical person and how you know the way
that they then approach poker think
about poker differs
have you seen that as well when
poker players come to you for coaching
how their brain works differently and
have you had to change your approach
based on
what kind of person they are
yeah absolutely so i think in simple
terms we could go
you've got the creative kind of
intuitive instinctive people and then
you've got the more logistic people who
like to have like rules and follow a
certain methods idea myself i'm more the
logistic person so it's easier for me to
communicate in logic than it is the kind
of intuitive creative side
but yeah i think it's really important
to know
where you fit like what's your strengths
because it often yes you work on your
weaknesses improve them but for clanty
for example he's never going to have
anywhere near as much success trying to
use his intuition get creative and
things that aren't in his natural
strengths whereas if he uses solvers
he's gonna do great with those so it's
no one like what your natural tendencies
are and claim than your strengths for
the most part and building your strategy
around there i think one of the examples
you used as well clanty was an engineer
and that got me thinking of one of our
recent podcast guests was zinho and he
was a classic engineer he would he loved
to build everything was about building
strategies building even his business
was around it was like putting bricks
together and trying to get to this
really this is the building process was
really fun for him so again it's knowing
that about yourself and yeah playing
towards those strengths and the brand's
got different modes we can definitely go
into a creative mode even for a
logistical person but if you're strongly
towards one side of the equation you're
gonna play better in that field so
you're gonna basically base your
strategies your life around uh your
strengths rather than trying to count
your witnesses see i think it's really
good to have the self-awareness to know
that and yeah i think the logistical
people normally find out earlier because
i think it's logistical people know me
clash on myself i would clash with
people who were very emotional or they
struggled to uh
map out what they were thinking in a
logistic clear way because i'm okay if
you can't tell me concisely i don't i
don't understand the methodology but
over time yeah definitely as a coach
i've learned to uh communicate better
with different styles of personality
types especially those who can't speak
in logic and they're more
emotional-based or they're more
intuitive based and they're trying to
express things through their feeling and
the generally they will at the point
tables play more creative more intuitive
instinctive and yeah i think it's really
yeah there's definitely a lot of variety
on that scale what's super interesting
is even in 2022
there's not really a better or worse
strategy you'd be very very
solver heavy and do incredibly well you
can be very intuitive creative and do
very very well i know some people have
debates over which one wins or a g2 on
exploitation but you have like very like
not polar opposite but very different
approaches to the game and still have
very successful careers that's the high
sticks obviously you've got the very
very high stakes you could argue that a
gto and logic might
take exploit some point but yeah i think
it's fascinating and i think it's good
if you're watching this reflect are you
a logistical person are you a builder an
entrepreneur an engineer type or are you
an instinctive intuitive guy like renee
so yeah i think now be a good time to do
a bit of reflecting and looking back on
your career and the first question i
have for you is what is the number one
lesson you think you've learned through
poker so something you didn't know prior
to poker but the number one lesson that
poker has taught you
maybe sounds a bit uh
boring really but i would say to think
in terms of ev
is really really powerful
and to
accept that your ev is positive
hopefully and to have a negative outcome
but still be okay with that
i think before poker if i was to get
unlucky for something i'd be like
also not only would i be annoyed but i
also might be results orientated and
think oh well that was a bad decision i
should have done that whereas now poker
allows me to think no this was the right
decision um i can't think of like too
many real world examples that happens
but every now and again i can i catch
myself
coming into this like semi-poker mode
where i'm just thinking i'm trying to
let's say calculate the situation and
then i can make a determined
guess as to where i think i should go
and then it's more logical and if it's
as long as i'm happy with my decision
then i'm happy with the outcome
regardless of what happens and yeah i
think even even just like simple things
um in life you can you can translate to
some sort of evie and then yeah i think
that's definitely helped me i'm not
saying i think about evie in every
single you know most of my realizations
are still intuitive but every now and
again you can you can you think about
the evie of it
yeah did that come natural for you early
in your career or did you struggle with
results-oriented thinking early on do
you have any any sort of learning curves
where this wasn't a strong skill of
yours yeah i don't think i don't think i
was very good at the start i think poker
brought that out for sure um not sure
exactly when that helped me or rather
when it when it started to become a real
thing but at the start i think i was
just like most normal people which is um
results you know bad bad
outcome bad decision good outcome good
decision and then poker train should not
think that black and white
yeah i think it is a really interesting
skill that does actually translate into
almost everything you do because once
you really learn to think in av for like
big decisions you can't really switch
that off because it is like a really
accurate way of viewing like any
situation's got a probability of going
good bad indifferent and yeah what
actually happens in the short term
doesn't really matter but most decisions
in life we get one good result of one
bad result you will often judge that
result based on the outcome rather than
actually ev yeah i think once you train
yourself i think like you said poker
almost forces you to learn this skill if
not you're gonna have a lot of i can
tilt issues around your results it
trains you to think actually what's the
eb did i make the right decision there
could i improve my decision irrelevant
of the actual outcome and attach myself
from it so yeah really really good one
so
as you've moved upstairs has there been
any
big jumps that you've made in terms of
like your approach to uh
your life overall so that i mean like
say you're moving from one case to two
kids have you ever had to do a full
upgrade of plenty off the tables to
almost like level up your habits your
routines the way you're approaching the
game has been any point where you've
went you know what in order to play this
level i'm going to step things up has
that had to happen at any stage for you
no i think you're pretty linear um
i definitely don't splurge in real life
with money at all i'm pretty
conservative with that stuff
so
yeah i think everything's been pretty
consistent i
i mean there's definitely been there's
levels to it because when i started
playing poker i was living in my bedroom
with my nan um you know she we had a
small two bed place and i was just
living in a bedroom and
that was easy you know and now i've got
my own place so i would say there's
levels to it where if i was still
playing tennis now i probably wouldn't
be able to
be living by myself
um so there's levels but i'm not someone
let's say i won the sunday million
um
i would not go and then splurge on a
watch or something which is like pretty
common uh people win a big tournament
they go and buy like a five grand watch
i wouldn't i don't think i will ever
ever i don't care how wealthy i can get
i would never do that um
so yeah and in terms of like study
routines or like poker habits
um i actually think i'm studying less
than i used to i used to study a lot and
now i'm more into
playing a bit more so i would actually
have studied less i think i used to be i
actually think i did it well even though
it was fortunate it worked out that way
i think you should invest more time into
studying when you're coming up the
stakes and then when you get to a level
where you can just start to make a good
amount of money then you still want to
study you want to you'll still want to
keep up with the curve and try and stay
ahead of it but then you want to put
less focus on studying and more focused
on playing and applying and then also
learning so renee says he learns from
playing against villains and learning
what they're doing i learn from playing
but not so much about what they're doing
about what i'm doing so you might study
a situation but then when you're playing
you just find a
same situation so it might be button
versus big blind but it might be a
specific turn or a specific river then
it makes you think so i think now i
i put more eggs into playing and then
learning from playing so like i might
get a a different situation that i've
never thought about before or
i haven't thought i've thought about
before but now i understand it all of a
sudden sometimes you just kind of get
those eureka moments where you just now
all of a sudden out of nowhere you just
understand the spot and it just takes
you the 20th time to finally
click
so um long story short you're on so i
would say no i don't think i've really
upgraded
um in one swift action i think it's just
more been a
slow process
yeah so you said at the moment your
player is and playing more and your
ability to learn through playing might
have improved i was just thinking as you
were talking i wonder if that's a common
kind of theme for players where as their
skill level progresses they can actually
learn more themselves
playing because they've got a lot of
heuristics they've got a lot of ways of
problem solving where in your career you
can't instead of road blocking like i
just don't know i just do not know how
to solve this problem so you almost
can't learn through playing as much
because you hit too many obstacles where
you don't have the framework to think
that's an interesting thing for myself
to reflect on so for yourself with
studying and playing what's a rough
ratio of studying to play in that you're
currently on so you're most playing
heavy at the moment what does that look
like on a weekly basis
well i say playing heavy i still really
play less than most professionals to be
honest
i play four days a week four hours a day
so 16 hours a week
and then i study five days a week i say
study but i also coach so coaching is
definitely a form of study i don't
classify as that but i have to
appreciate that part of it is
and i study anywhere from 50 to 100
minutes so i have this like simple
mantra that i say to myself which is
that i will study twice a day five days
a week
for anywhere between 25 to 50 minutes so
i basically study in 25 minute segments
and i will either do one or two of those
per session two of them a day so either
i can go from two to twenty five or two
dollars to fifty or one twenty five and
one fifth and i'll do that five days a
week and then i'll play my four days so
it ends up being i don't know what the
math would be but i probably play 70 30
play study so not crazy not you know
there's definitely i'm i'm playing good
stakes and and there's not 10 hours in
in playing land and then four hours in
study land there's nothing like that i
used to study more than i do now
when did you start that mantra of the 25
minutes to 50 minutes what part of your
career did you inject that
i'm not sure um definitely recent it's
definitely in the last year i would say
i've been i'm trying to balance my life
more where i'm i'm
not just playing and studying but also
doing other things getting fit and
healthy
and yeah i just realized it wasn't that
time in the day it was just my days was
just so busy with
well playing studying coaching run it
once
i have a trainer that i'm working with
as well
so there's a lot of things that go on in
the day that i just can't get around to
studying for hours and hours so i picked
out
initially it was 20 minutes where i
would do either a 20-minute session or
40-minute session with a break in the
middle and then i made it 25 just
because i felt like it's a bit better
and yeah that's just what i do now so i
don't i also feel like if you study for
hours and hours on end unless you're
studying with someone your brain just
switches off so i studied with ben
actually i didn't even include that but
i said with ben on wednesday for two
hours or two and a half hours and that's
great i really enjoy it because i'm i've
got company there but if i'm studying by
myself then it's just uh it's just 25
minutes and i'll take a break and then
i'll decide if i want to come back for
another 25 and it's not more than that
it's not i i very rarely would stay for
an hour by myself unless there is a
particular interest if i'm having a good
time but usually
um honestly i'm usually having to force
myself i don't particularly enjoy
studying anymore unless i'm
having a buddy to do it with
do you think kevin knows shorter blocks
like they said 25 minutes that's the
kind of minimum do you feel like that
helps you to overcome resistance of
starting a study session turn off for a
lot of players they they want to be
studying more but just things get in the
way they're busy they want to grind
instead and almost like studying gets
pushed to one side and then i was ended
up getting less and less and it's quite
daunting to go right i'm gonna do it i
was still you know two hours studying on
a deep topic where the brain's gonna
think really clearly so do you think for
yourself having those kind of
shorter sessions like say 25 minutes is
a minimum do you think that allows you
to overcome the resistance about you
start a study session
yeah
like anything in life even outside of
poker you will be consistent at what you
enjoy
and i don't particularly enjoy study
unless i'm with ben so with with ben we
are super consistent and we i imagine we
both enjoy it as well so we can just do
the two and a half hour block we take a
short break in the middle and it's
really enjoyable so we're really good at
that um by myself i just can't do that
so i just make it the 25 minutes and i
actually i also say i don't enjoy
something i do enjoy studying for the 25
minutes and then a break if i force
myself to make it an hour in one go
which i used to do i feel like um
there's going to be a lot of players who
resonate with this where they just they
are quite stubborn with no they they
hold themselves to a certain standard so
they'll say no i'm going to study for
two hours because that's the person that
i am and i'm going to do that and then
they crumble because they don't do it in
the end if you just kind of like
humble yourself a bit and say you know
i'm just gonna say for 25 minutes that's
all i've got to do
then you end up enjoying it more because
you've got less pressure and it's it's
not too hard to start that because it's
just 25 minutes it's a lot easier than
like from 8 to 11
and then you're like god i'm like an
hour and a half in i've still got
another hour and i have to go it's a lot
harder to do it that way
yeah and with your approach you still
have the option to go longer if you want
to so it's almost like a win-win if
you're enjoying the 25 minutes you can
do 50 an hour whatever yeah i like that
as well i think often we create rigid
rules through good intention we want to
push ourselves
like i said as soon as you start losing
the enjoyment there's not many people
who are consistent with things they
don't enjoy and if they are very often
not going to perform as well over the
long term if they're constantly using
like kind of willpower whipping
themselves to actually start get to do
something so yeah i think it's really a
good good advice to actually lower the
kind of minimum requirements to allow
yourself to uh study more frequently but
enjoy that process do you use anything
similar with with poker or is poker just
more fun overall for you
sorry
um yeah playing i really enjoy actually
so i can i do my four hours four days a
week and that's always the highlight i
would say the highlight in my week is
either playing or coaching and i really
enjoy both
um
sometimes getting crushed at poke and i
don't enjoy it
but if i'm not getting crushed
then i'm having a great time and
only toward the end of it like i might
be my last half hour of the grind and
i'm a bit tired i'm definitely tired and
i'm definitely blanking in some spots
um but no playing is is way easier than
studying for me oh and also you
mentioned earlier about the
um
it's
easier to
play and learn when you're quite like so
when you start playing
in early in your career it's hard to
learn from playing because you're kind
of lost i think i agree with that but
also it depends on what kind of player
you are so i think if you're let's say a
more logical bass player you might
struggle to learn from playing when
you're a novice but if you're an
instinctive player you might benefit
early from playing
in your career because i don't think it
really changes at that point you're just
instinctive throughout whereas with me i
definitely didn't learn from playing
early in my career it's only once i
started to understand the game
you don't want to get into the mindset
of just thinking about like blockers and
unblockers and this spot as very static
you still want to learn the mechanics of
poker as renee has made a product about
because that's still very important but
even though things do change in the
sliding scales you want to understand
the underlying themes of the game once
you do understand them then you can
quite often just learn while playing
because you're you understand that the
foundations of the game and then you can
just jump into like i love it where
um for some reason it doesn't run very
much but sometimes the anti games will
run on poker stars not very often though
and i really enjoy those games but
everyone is going to be making mistakes
also the anti-games will depend on how
many players is it six-handed where
there's like one point two big blinds of
ants or is it three-handed but there's
only 0.6 and that's going to change it
right
but no one really plays those effects
and everyone's deviating and that's
really really fun
but i think you can only really do that
if you're a logical brain after getting
good at the game otherwise you just kind
of like crumble because those rigid
rules you set yourself are falling down
fast and then you're breaking down
mentally
super interesting yeah i like that i've
never
never thought of that before but that
makes sense a more creative intuitive
player maybe like the rhino type will be
able to learn from playing maybe early
in their career because they're
constantly using that part of their
brain whereas someone's more logistical
who needs more of a roadmap or solvers
to kind of highlight the way might need
a certain bit of a experience and
knowledge before they can actually start
to actually solve problems on the fly or
learn as much from playing so yeah very
very interesting i never really thought
about it before so one question i asked
i remember in the conversation
though we know how that the story ends
you said when you first started playing
poke on facebook for example um it was a
mistake it was it cost a mistake so like
let's go back to that in a moment where
you're you're jumping into poker
completely clueless just playing and
you're not knowing going through
what do you wish you hadn't known in
that moment that would help fast-track
you or set up a little bit better for
what's to come
firstly poker is really hard
it's not just a card game well it is
just a card game but turns out the card
game is really hard and secondly um i
would not have
so i think maybe this is just me but i
think most poker players um
getting to poker thinking they're
smarter than what they are
and i think there's like a common theme
not only with poker just but other
things like let's say um for example
you're on a night out and uh you there's
five of you and you've got i mean mate
yeah
i think this is somewhat true so let's
say this have you on a night out and you
go and play a new game i feel like
there'd be some subconscious bias that
thinks the guy earning the most money a
year in something completely separates
what you're doing will be the best
player this new game at least maybe not
so um
like definite but subconsciously we i
think we think that same if we have like
let's say there's a really really um
good athlete in a certain field when
they start playing a new game they're
going to be good at this even if the
game is completely separate what they
are and i feel like i thought okay i'm
good with numbers i'm going to be good
with poker it turns out
i'm good with numbers but i'm not going
to poke her so i think the two things
would be poke is really hard and i'm not
as smart as what i thought i was um
in fact
i think that the strengths in poker that
you need to be good at i am actually not
very good at i would say i even fall
below the average so yeah that would be
two things
okay so if you had to give yourself
those two bits of advice before you've
even started your career it's gonna be a
lot harder than you think and you're not
as good as you think would that have
inspired you to keep going i would you
just turned away at that obstacle
so the first one about perka being
really hard i would have i would have
actually found inspiration in that i'm
sure but if i had the foresight that i
told myself that i wasn't good at it
then i would have just quit
but if some so but if somebody told me
if renee told me
that he came from the future and he knew
that i would suck at the game i would
say [ __ ] you i'm gonna still try and do
this but if it was myself coming from
the future then i would say okay well
then i should just not do this so it's
kind of like coming down to
i'm very stubborn but then if it's from
myself if i've told myself that i'm not
good at it then it comes that confidence
thing you know the innate confidence and
that would knock my confidence and i
wouldn't want to do it anymore also i
really enjoy poker as a game
um
i don't really do poker for the money
from being completely honest with you
so
i mean partly i do because you know i
wouldn't play i wouldn't play play money
but i think that's because nobody who's
good at poker plays play money
it's really the competition that i get
from it and if i didn't think i was very
good and i didn't think i was
competitive in the game i wouldn't get
that thrive anymore
so
i think i think i would probably um i
would have still played poker no matter
how hard i thought it would be but the
moment i thought i wasn't good at it
that i wouldn't do it
what is it about competition that you
like what is it what does it bring out
in you that you would do it even if
there was no money why do you think
competition's a big part of your drive
i just love beating someone um
well that's not true because i don't
really care if they're recreational if
if they're a recreational player then i
don't care but if they are professional
then i love beating or outperforming a
professional you know
when i'm playing on poker stars and
playing three-handed and i'm i'm open to
the new table they always moan at me
like clanty can you close the new table
i never do it well sometimes i do but
very rarely and it pisses them off but
the whole point is that i want to play
against them so long as i don't think
even if i think i'm a dog in the game
which is occasionally i do
um i'll still do it because i want to i
want to
be competitive i want to
have a good time and i don't know about
you guys but i'm having the most fun
when i'm playing against other really
really good poker players i'm not having
a good time a good time if i've got five
tables on the go and all of them have a
recreational i'm still playing poker
because i'm still making money i know i
still need to be professional right but
i'm having way more fun if i've got less
tables but then really good players on
all the tables
that's just me
yeah so other than polka is there
anything else in your life that brings
out that same competitive drive was it
being any when you're younger i think
video games you said you played that a
lot quite a lot is anything else where
you've been equally competitive
um i so when i was a lot younger i used
to do temping bowling
that was something that i was really
good at at young age um
and i just kind of quit that at some
point but that was my thing for a long
time from the age of like maybe eight
till maybe like seven to twelve
um i was really really serious i was
going around the country playing
tournaments
and then after that i got into video
games was really really serious with
that
and then i
found poker and then i actually i also
found that
upon learning poker and putting so many
eggs into that basket i then took a step
back from video games because i
basically thought i can't learn video
games and poker at the same time because
also i don't know about you but
poke teaches you how to learn
so i think the next thing i find which
i'm not sure what will be but i think
after poker it'll probably be something
like chess or something like that where
um it's a very competitive one-to-one
game i think uh i will have a better
chance at having success at chess than
somebody else not because of you know
how smart i am or anything
but because
i know how to learn through poker focus
taught me that skill set
so
yeah right now i would say i'm just
competitive with uh poker only
i did post i did try to learn chess and
video games but i just found i wasn't
seeing the ev in it because it was
taking away from poker
yeah you had the self-awareness to
realize at some point you can't split
yourself between two endeavors
especially if you're trying to get very
good at them and you want to compete
against very good people very often at
some point sometimes when you're young
you can kind of multitask a few
different options but there almost comes
a point where i write if i really want
to compete at this at a high level i
need to give it more of my time and
attention it's really good that you had
the self-awareness to see that point so
i think if you tried to mix uh poke out
in video games i'm sure one of them
would have uh took those attention and
maybe both would have been so optimal so
we talked about their being stubborn as
well so i think stubborn's very
interesting trait where it's got a lot
of positives where it allows you to
stick out things when things get rough
you you weather it out you got
resilience to keep going when things get
hard and most people quit on the flip
side it's got some negative traits where
you stick to things too long you're
trying to improve a point or you can't
give things up have been examples in
your life where you've been too stubborn
um
oh yeah gotta be right lots
uh
i'm trying to think of poker where i've
been too stubborn about something
i can't think precisely what it was but
i used to be quite an ego head with a
lot of things where i wouldn't let
something go
um whether or not i believed in it or
not it was just down to ego and kind of
stubbornness at the same time now i'm a
lot better at that
um and i'm i'm able to just kind of like
take a backseat and realize that i'm
wrong and here's how i learn from it
actually i was on a walk yesterday with
my neighbor and we're talking we're
talking about this where
i think poker trains you to be humble in
a way because you are facing
adversity but also you are facing just
constant
bombardment of being wrong which is good
because it teaches you to just learn
from your mistakes as opposed to
at least me of being 20 years old and
thinking i don't make mistakes i am just
good at what i'm doing you know and
having this kind of innate self innate
sense of self-worth which is just crap
so
i think uh yeah i was just very stubborn
down to ego and now that's i've realized
that that's just not the way to be and
and it's actually very important to be
wrong all the time because then you you
don't have this attachment with being
right anymore
yeah so you said it's been very humbling
for you being a poker player
in the quiz we asked you before the for
the podcast you you said you were a bit
of a sore loser i think prior get into
polka so how does that show up compared
to
being able to take losses and put your
ego aside
where where's the s so lose there are
you short up in your career
oh well i'm still a sore loser
i still don't like losing but again i
think that is
partly down to the variance to be honest
with you um
i think i'd be a much much better loser
like okay i can actually prove this as
well because if i lose to someone who
plays the spot better than me i'm not a
loser
if they make a really good call and then
it turns out to be right and there was a
cool blocker effect or something
happening or just like a basic thing
that i was missing i'm not a sort of
loser at all i'm also a loser when they
make a mistake and they get and they get
rewarded for it so actually i would say
objectively i'm not assault i mean
definitely partly but i i would split it
i would say um
if if they play better than me then i
i'm humbling myself and saying they
played better than me they deserved it i
don't deserve to win but if i think i
deserve to win
then you best believe that i'm not gonna
you know i might shake their hand but i
might be mumbling something under my
breath you know
kind of thing
you could say you're you're so loser
only under certain conditions but most
of the time it sounds like yeah if
things go
yeah if you get outplayed almost don't
say if somebody fairly outplays you and
say okay i can accept that but if you
get a lucky they get lucky or they make
a mistake and get rewarded that's like
that doesn't sit well and then the soul
loser yeah and that comes down to this
innate feeling of what's right and
what's wrong and i think it's something
that all poker players need to kind of
juggle with or battle with where very
often poker feels unfair very often
pocket isn't fair it's it doesn't even
even out maybe about whole careers or
big samples but there's a level of
unfairness that goes on day-to-day where
people get rewarded over and over by
making mistakes and there's almost
nothing that's comparable like if you're
going to school in your normal life if
someone makes mistakes they fail a test
if you go to sport and someone messes up
they lose the game like but in poca
people can make mistakes get rewarded
over and over and in my mind was like
well that's not fair that's not fair and
we haven't experienced so much
unfairness for so long in in especially
when we're so invested in it so yeah i
can see like why it becomes difficult to
deal with and yes just understanding
like getting to know yourself well
enough to go right even when things
don't go my way even when it is unfair
i've got to be getting better at dealing
with that but yeah it's an interesting
one to explore at some point all right
so renee are you a sole loser sorry
i just want to say one thing as well
sorry to interrupt um i feel like we as
poker players think that poker has this
crazy sense of variance which i think is
true also depends on what format you're
playing if you're playing cash i
actually feel like poker has quite a low
sense of variance so let's just like
compare with the real world let's say
you're roger federer and you've just
trained the entire year for this event
and then
a week before the event you cut you fall
ill and then you can't play the event or
you do and you don't win
wouldn't that be like an insane level of
variance where you train the whole year
and your ev was really high your ev was
like basically to get first place like
90 of the time you come first five
percent of the time you come second
three percent of the time you come third
and two percent of the time you can't
compete and you hit the two percent
and you know that only happens one in 50
years and lo and behold it happened this
year so i feel like actually poker has a
low sense of variance because what's the
biggest thing that can happen to you if
you're playing cash
maybe take a big shot and then you lose
a huge pot but that only has like
maximal effect of like a month of
variance and that's still really rare
and it's never happened to me i've never
taken a big shot and then lost a massive
pot to be honest so i actually feel like
um
we
play or we live a life that actually has
fairly low variance i think if you are
playing a more mainstream um like
yeah tennis or football like world cup
one every four years right
and you're you're one of 11 players
you've got to rely on 10 other teammates
you might you might be training every
damn day of the year for four years but
if your teammates don't do the same
thing and they can't fall through you'll
never win the world cup that must be
really annoying
yeah i think it comes down to how many
opportunities you get to compete as a
poker player you compete every day every
day is game time every day is olympic
final every day is i can show up so
there's not so much damage that can be
done because tomorrow you just play
tomorrow so there's another even getting
sick as soon as you you're better again
you can you can play again and yeah i
think um novak djokovic at the
australian open would be a great example
he was favorite to win the tournament
gets to australia with his exemption uh
kind of covered test and as he arrives
they take it off him put him to a hotel
he wins the appeal so he could play
again he's the hot hot favorite to win
the tournament he's one of eight times
and then literally the day before the
tournament as he's practicing on the
courts they go nope you're not playing
you're going home pretty extreme event
and yeah that that is the pretty extreme
run bad i think the difference is that
they have those
extremes i think olympic athletes are a
great example like you said because like
every four years everything's got to go
right so on that one day in that one
time you feel great you're at your best
any injury in the build up any illness
that could take you out of it anything
that goes wrong with training in the
last few weeks that compromises
performance can can you just basically
take you out of a four-year trainer
block whereas poker players have it's
almost like more niggles like more
constant that's a little bit unfair
that's a little bit unfair so you don't
have the big extreme things it depends
what format you play but yeah i think
it's uh i think a lot of pocket players
do struggle with that in it feed on that
poker is unfair i i know some people
have run good their whole careers but
even those guys generally
feel that poke is unfair to them it's
almost like i think we've supported pad
said patrick leonard who's basically
saying i've run i've run good my whole
career i've run good spots have worked
out but then he started playing a bit
live and didn't get some caches and some
live tournaments
and his mind was going you're so unlucky
you're so unlucky why me why me and it's
really hard for us not to feel like the
victim because yeah there's so many
scenarios uh small scenarios where poker
can make us feel and look because
variance is not going to run out true
so renee would you class yourself as a
bad loser are you a good leader
i would say i find myself a little bit
in the in in the middle i don't really
think i'm very sore loser i do i do also
have what clanty has if someone plays a
hand very nicely i just get owned i just
you know a plot applaud to him you know
uh i would say i get indeed most tilted
when people do something ridiculous and
can then get lucky it's like what the
[ __ ]
uh
i remember last time uh
you know when someone just makes a call
you're like dude what the [ __ ] or just
bless you in pre-flop oh in with a
complete ridiculous hand you know they
suddenly get deuces in pre-flop and
you're there with ace king i'm like are
you kidding me how did you get deuces in
are you and you're gonna hold twice that
this deuces never loses as they say
monster tilt that that uh so in in that
regards i uh
i think i'm i'm indeed a sore loser but
actually i really liked your your your
view on variants we are indeed compared
to these other examples that you gave we
don't actually have that much variance i
can indeed imagine if you're a
tournament player it becomes a bit more
like an athlete where it's like oh world
series this is the moment oh i ran back
in especially you know when you run bad
in a couple of times you get deep and
every time you bubble the final table or
you get eighth instead of first you know
there's a lot of big variants there but
yeah indeed cash
that's actually a good perspective i
will uh
i will take that with me for the next
time things are not going so well i'm
like there's people who have it way
worse right it helps helps put it in
perspective i also
um
i wanted to i wanted to point out one
thing that you mentioned
you were saying
you were you're actually referring to
the it's called the halo effect where
you think you're good at something and
automatically you think you're good at
something else so for the people are
interested in that you can look that up
and you then mention like i'm good in
numbers but i don't have
certain strengths
that you need as a poker player
and
what i i actually thought adam was not
going to ask so what are these strings
but it didn't come so now now i ask that
question what are some of the strengths
that you think you miss
as a poker player
um i'm not even entirely sure if you
were so for i'll ask you a question if
you remove solvers
from poker
what makes a good poker player poker
player is it psychology is it numbers is
it creativity is it consistency
what would you say are the defining
factors i mean
obviously all those forced but i would
say
then the psychology of on just
understanding what people are up to
and like oh if i do this you do that or
you're gonna interpret this as this or i
interpret you're always in the other
guy's head and you're always one step
ahead so i would say that is gonna be
very important just understanding
how players play and that's i guess is
still the same versus recreational right
understanding the psychology behind
recreationals for example for people i
know
making strategies around data of playing
against recreationals is similar you see
a data and you try to understand the
psychology why does a fish
behave
why do these stats show up what does
that say about how the fish thinks about
a certain spot that leads him to have
certain leaks right so i would say the
psychology and then the creative part is
then coming up with the strategy
interpreting it and then coming up with
the strategy to find ways to exploit
that
so i would say those are then the
strengths so now you're going to say
that that's what i missed
i would say
i mean i feel like we're definitely the
creative side i feel sure
um i do think although maybe this is a
bit of a halo effect thing i feel like i
do have that good grasp on the
psychological side
i feel like i get that intuition where
they might take a certain timing or a
certain size and then i leave i don't
even know why i think what i think but i
i think okay i'm going to do this
because i did that i'm going to do this
so i i do feel like i have a strong um
instinctive side based on the psychology
but perhaps my creativity is just so
lacking
that i just can't
have success i do think that without
sobers i would still be a winning poker
player because i was a winning i went
from 10 to 50 in a year
but i don't think i would have ever got
past 200 without that i think that i
would i i would have a cap there because
guys like you would just kind of see
through me and maybe not see through me
but you'd you would end up just
outperforming i would come up with more
creative creative strategies basically
yeah you would have more tours in your
kit than i would so
i would say that my
perhaps my psychology is good but not
good enough and then my create my
creative side is just lacking massively
that makes you seem to have good both
i i also wanted to point
or go back to a point where you were
saying that
you what you enjoy the most is go to
pokerstars find the toughest lineups and
play a couple of tables three
four-handed well i i particularly
enjoyed three or four-handed i think
they should just remove ep mp under the
gun from the poker tables that yeah just
do everyone a favor if there's a poker
side listening just remove that [ __ ]
um
i like it also more you know when ranges
become a little bit wider and it becomes
a bit more the wild wild west and you
know whereas if you play in spots where
there's a fair few combos error error
error you know it's like okay yeah
if you make a mistake it's less
yeah i guess less of an ev mistake in in
wider positions but
what you liked about it was the
to kind of see if you could beat them
right the competitive drive for example
if i play against recreationals
i actually take a lot of joy from trying
to get the maximum out of them as
possible
like and this i guess then comes the i
like to create strategies against
recreationals i like to try to figure
out what they do
and then playing against recreation
suddenly becomes fun you're like hey yes
i know that if i do this you're gonna do
that oh yeah this is one of these spots
and then you execute it you come up with
a strategy against recreationals you
start executing it and you see it work
oh yeah i introduced a great bluff here
oh yeah i knew he was going to do that
so you take i take a lot of joy from
that
for example if i play against
recreationals but you probably see more
as like let's say you play four-handed
the recreational just get ah
[ __ ] he destroyed the game
what are you gonna what are you doing
here get off my table
sometimes
sometimes i feel that way um i've never
thought about your perspective of
maximizing evie maybe that's something i
can take with me because
uh sometimes it just feels like
especially if you're playing heads up
and they're really really nitty and your
win rate just comes from them folding
blinds it's just like such a monotonous
grind of just like oh so now we're
playing against semi fish that i hate
the most
don't draw don't join the table if
you're a semi fish because then you know
i cannot go all all creative on you
but it's also not like you know you
trigger my competitive nature so then
just join don't don't join the table
just just three four-handed if a
semi-fit often you see me leave if a
semi-fish joins a tip it's like uh he
loses like minus five minus ten it's
like come on i want minus twenty minus
thirty minus 40. i want the loser then
we can start playing from poker
yeah there's a guy on stars uh sasha
something sasha underscored 1900
something he's got bentley as his avatar
he's like a losing player who loses at a
small loss rate and he's really really
tight and yeah i've left left tables
when he's joined because it's just you
know me four eggs and him it's just like
this is just boring
those tables i i i instantly leave yeah
there's just no i see no point there's
no financial incentive there's no
competitive incentive there's no
creative incentive it's just like that
table has gone to waste
yeah time to open a new one so then i
then i see plenty already sitting at the
new one of course
yeah and then we can have some fun there
uh so yeah but it's it's the difference
but because people often also
and i i felt victim of that i remember
at a very long point in my career i
played a lot of three four-handed i
think if i go through my database i've
played maybe 150
000 hands 200 000 heads three
four-handed uh and
for
that rim rate is actually higher than my
six-handed win rate
and
that was because if a fish joined the
table i would just zone out because i
would be like oh it's a fish
i beat the i'm better than the fish so i
don't have to focus on that table
anymore
and as soon as i started realigning it i
was like oh [ __ ] i need to see the fish
joining as an opportunity so it's not
the goal is not i'm trying to beat the
fish no the goal is i'm trying to make
the maximum how can i make the maximum
amount of money at this table of
everyone and that then suddenly got me
re-engaged again like okay well
yes i'm winning but how can i really
squeeze the last bit of money out of
this guy and that then triggered my
sort of competitive nature again okay
let's try to figure out how is this
possible or i remember then that was in
a time where scripts were also still
allowed
a very very bad bum hunting rack
scripted in my game then my goal was how
can i make sure that this guy is not
winning in the game in my game that he
just scripted in i know this is this is
a little bit the ego side of the wacko
coming up but you know it's a couple
years ago but these were all ways that
would trigger
the game becoming six-handed or fish
joining the table
make
yeah to trigger my competitive nature
and make it more
enjoying i guess
so maybe that's something you can
you can take away all right next time
i've actually taken notes yeah by the
screen maximizing ev versus recreational
because
whatever can kind of
um
well firstly just enjoying it but if you
can if you can find some competition
from recreationals
and not also like zoning out as you were
saying then that's the goal in of itself
is just to not zone out of our system
because that's what i do too often
yeah so i'll that's my tip to you
um
going back to uh going to the present
moment
uh i'm curious let's say for example uh
you and i
we get on a zoom call next week to do
some poker strategy what are you most
excited about
in poker right now
that you would then share with me like
weko we're going to talk today about the
topic i'm most excited about in poker
right now and that is
i would say i don't know if it's if
excitement or just um
there's a lot of stuff that i don't know
um which is forward pots i feel like i'm
understudied in four bit pots and i ran
a few sims recently and you get you know
what's actually there is something
that's exciting is there's a lot of just
gto strategies and forbid parts that you
never see in application which not only
means that i don't know it but nobody
else knows it either so i would say that
kind of excites me is
seeing these new game plans that i know
firstly will be confusing people
and and secondly we'll just uh
give me win rate over them so the
competitive side comes out again if i
can play three-handed with you and
another guy and i can do something that
you've never seen before
then um that's going to confuse you
right there's there's actually a spot in
poker and forward pots where you can get
five percent of the pot and if you
run all of the sizing so five ten
sixteen twenty fifty percent five
percent is the only size that's used and
it's like the highest ev and most
frequent in everything um that's pretty
cool right i mean maybe that's me
nerding out but i feel like betting five
percent of the parts pretty cool thing
to be doing
i usually stick with 10 but hey okay i'm
gonna take this tip and and see if i can
lower it down to five no actually four
web pots shout out to probably actually
when this podcast is live my new
masterclass would have come out which
includes how to play four webparts out
of position and i remember my last
lesson i did in our cfp
was about four by pots so collar four
better imposition out position called
for bedpods and indeed if you look at
for example what population is doing and
what solver suggests i mean there are
some very big gaps going on so indeed
what people are doing compared to what
solver suggests there's a very big gap
which which also makes sense right
forward pods are understudied for a
reason because how many four bed bots do
you actually play
yeah not many not many so and it kind of
comes back you know as uh you asked me
the question on how would you give uh
what would your advice be to how to use
the sol how to use solvers for a long
time i was just using 4-bit pots or i
was studying for a pots hand by hand i
was creating the spr as per the
situation i was creating the ranges as
but well the ranges were static but the
spi was different um and it took me a
while just to like you know finally
realize okay create static forward pots
um
run aggregations
see see better strategies see fold
strategy like there's a lot of spots as
well with forward pots where if you're
at a position um you are not supposed to
have a check call range it's either donk
or check raise and never check cool
and that's a new thing to me because you
never get that in three parts obviously
in three perhaps you're pretty happy so
i mean there are like very extreme
situations where you don't have a check
call
but you're talking like you might play
never really whereas in former parties a
lot of new things so um
yeah
popularity
far away for four robots
i remember especially out of position
color compared to how people population
plays has imposition there is some weird
ass stuff going on man indeed what you
said i i've i've seen those spots as
well where check calling is just not a
thing
and also
even probably also you look down further
the tree what do you have to check crazy
that's all there is also some weird
stuff going on there it's like what it's
it becomes the most insane merch fast
that you've ever seen and you know yeah
if you start the thing is also if you
start to implement that in game this is
actually where you also mentioned
trainers
that you use trainers i find trainers
very helpful in uncommon spots so like
for bad pods or
because you can suddenly get quite a lot
of volume in a certain spot but then
when it comes because the sp are so low
it's almost place it plays like you know
you're playing 10 bb poker but obviously
you're throwing in stacks with quite
marginal hands so it can be quite
challenging for for for your mindset i
would say just splashing in money it can
feel quite spewy would you agree
yeah i actually played a hand yesterday
i haven't looked at it yet um and it was
uh i called a four bet with a screen off
suit small blind versus button the flops
four three deuce with two diamonds and i
had ace cream with the queen of diamonds
and he just shipped in 80 into 40. i
called he had jackside ace queen
i don't know if it's good but yeah that
was that was a hand as i just i just
flopped ace queen on four three dudes
with the queen high flush draw and check
two times pop for all in and it felt
okay i mean i had 40 against jax as well
so the hand that i was and he had he had
jacks with the diamond so kind of like
even against the hand that i was
expecting to have i still had the equity
so i imagine my chord is good but that's
very uncomfortable just like calling off
ace ace either but i think
yeah especially on these blue boards uh
the
the air does a lot of jamming it's just
like he has so many
hands that benefit from the gems right
away right like exactly the hand that
you mentioned and also his bluff so i
have so much so much equity and often
you might even dominate your calling
range for example ace king there
easy gem because you can call a screen
you will call other flush draws you can
deny equity overhead like 10 jack suited
which is great
because yeah i mean what do you do you
check
and then
he starts maybe bluffing you so there's
a lot of incentives to just jam straight
away there uh
but yeah your call
seems
okay from
from what i see here yeah i'm not sure
if it is good but it definitely kind of
tests you man you do need a diamond i
think from oh yeah yeah
i think i definitely needed diamonds um
yeah i don't know if it's good but like
you say it does test you mentally
because it kind of gets you out of the
comfort zone of one and he should jam
ace queen himself as well especially if
he doesn't in this case also like i said
the diamond argument goes both ways if
he doesn't has diamonds you call more
diamonds if he has a diamond
uh he has more equity for his hand like
tents
yeah yeah so yeah that my conclusion was
just just rip it in get it over with
i mean there's no easier spot right you
see your wheelboard you're like oh okay
i'm owen or you see like the jack then
the jack then x two tone okay i'm all in
and there's no further mistakes that you
can make it's it's quite nice to play
that way
um so four web bots okay we can have a
we can have a little session on four web
pass plenty no no problem
another question that i had for you you
you mentioned also that you could tilt
of players who make mistakes i wanted to
ask you
who
is
who would you consider to be a nemesis
you don't have to call nicknames who do
you consider to be an emphasis at the
table and why is he your nemesis what is
it about him or her we don't know that
triggers you
it triggers me um
um i'm not gonna name the nickname
but he's a heads-up player and he
used to only sit me in heads up but only
one table and
or rather only one entry and there's
like this unwritten ruling heads up
which is that if you want to if you want
to contest the lobby play two entries
you can't play three or four it's just
heads up so many places too and if you
want to contest someone then play two
entries unless the person holding lobby
only wants to play one but it's fine but
he would just sit me
only one table and you'd play really
slow and he played really nitty and
because i was stubborn i don't really
give him the lobby because then he wins
but he would only pay me one table so he
would just piss me off because he was
like in my mind it's bad etiquette to do
that
it'd be like for example me playing
against you but then taking
you know all my time bang for every
single decision
almost on purpose it's like well it's
not against the rules but it's
it's a big thing to do right so i'd say
he would be my nemesis just because it
really annoyed me what he would do
because it would obviously interrupt my
grind elsewhere as well where i'd be
having to play one table heads up um
i would say him really the only guy that
i would say is like a nemesis but not
anymore he doesn't do it so i don't
think i have a nemesis i'd say my only
nemesis would be like a really annoying
player that's very good not annoying as
in
doing dick things like that
and there's a few of them
makuu fz is extremely good and annoying
um he's definitely like the player i
would least want to see on the table he
kind of like goes past the equilibrium
where i want to play against good
players
but then he gets to a point where he's
that annoying and good that actually he
can just start off like i'll play
against good good guys that aren't that
good you know what i mean where he's
just he's just uh yeah he's too annoying
i would say he's my nemesis where i
didn't play many hands against him but
whenever i do it's like yep it's always
a reminder he's really really really
bloody good
no he's definitely very tough to play
against i can uh i can confirm that
sometimes though if you if you put let's
say for example we gather a bunch of uh
of regulars and we discuss who will find
the hardest to play against and some
people name and name the other guy
him because on the short term also you
can just like i said you can just get in
a couple of spots where you just feel
like he's keeping he keeps on owning you
right i remember in in in the cp we
would have discussions about like the
biggest knit
uh uh and everyone was just running over
him and there's one guy he always hero
calls me and everyone would look at him
like he hero calls never never you can
just keep on going he will keep a full
no against me though but do you know
it's just a short-term sample
that
makes you think of something about a
player that might actually not be true
right we need longer term samples but
even in the long term samples i'm sure
uh i would also prefer not to have my
tables
okay
so going forward in poker what are uh
what are some of your goals
hey you your goal used to be i want to
make money out of this game right but
i'm sure over the years
you have every time when you reach to
the next level be like oh i don't know
what's next what's next what are your
current goals
i would say
to like
really establish myself as like the the
top circle of poker which i would say is
the
i mean it's a shame it doesn't really
run anymore but like the the 10k games
would be nice
to play in regularly and they have been
running a bit recently than if you've
seen between nacho davey munez and
stefan i've been running some some
pretty nice games so i'd be i would want
to be playing those games by i'm not
sure when depends kind of on how my
shots go
so i would i would really i would say my
goal is to establish myself
at 10k
and it took me a whole year to establish
myself a 5k because every shot that i i
took busted but like fingers crossed it
seems to be okay now
so i would say it's just to get to 10k
and then after that i don't know because
now 20k and 40k games only run on gg and
i don't want to play that so i feel like
10k is the last hurdle
that you can really get to on pokerstars
and then don't know what happens after
that i've been thinking about either plo
or tournaments um probably pl plo
because it's cash so that'll be maybe my
next step after is to learn a new game a
new discipline but still within the
world of poker
all right and then so so you're you want
to sort of finish the job
and then basically
uh when you when you get there you quit
or you're gonna you're gonna look for a
different challenge where you can start
from zero that's basically what you're
saying
not quit i definitely won't i've been
thinking about this for a while i
definitely won't quit poker um i can
definitely see myself playing poker
maybe not necessarily playing poker as i
am now where i'm like actively playing
most days um but i'm definitely going to
be coaching poker or you know doing
something in the poker world because i
feel like
especially with me where i dropped out
of school i have like no qualifications
at all i don't even have gcses adam
would know what they are so i have
nothing so i feel like i can't you know
i don't have the benefit of having for
example there are other poker players
who have degrees where they might be
able to come out a poke and then go and
get different jobs so i'm definitely
going to stick with in poker but it
might not be um actively playing high
stakes it might be playing high sex plo
instead or something but i definitely
wouldn't just quit this and then go to a
new thing um because i'm too invested i
feel like i've just put way too many
eggs into this basket to just like drop
the basket when i get to the top i feel
like that would just be a massive
hemorrhaging in evie
that makes no sense uh your poker
learned to think of in terms of ev right
so this is a good uh this is a good
example of that uh you mentioned
nacho david jones stefan
uh definitely another game that i would
sit in uh i like money so yeah
it does also really seem like a great
idea
uh
what do you think is the gap that you
would still need to close in order to
sit down at the 10k tables between those
three and be a winner at the games
well maybe this seems crazy but i feel
like i would be a winner in those games
in my mind
um stefan
me and him heads up no he would crush me
i actually did play a session to get
some heads up he is
we spoke about the the logicist versus
the
instinctive guy he is at least he
definitely is instinctive he might be
both maybe he can be both maybe he's
just an ultra genius but he's definitely
instinctive to an extent and i think he
he is just very very very good at it but
i think the other three players i think
nunes davey at nacho in my mind i think
i'm competitive with
and i don't think stefan's that far
ahead to just kind of like crush
everyone
um especially when he's been putting a
lot of eggs into heads up for the last
year so
um i think that the issue would just be
bankroll honestly um i don't know don't
get me wrong do i think i sit into that
game and win five big blinds no i think
like best case scenario win 1.5 blinds
but you know the rake is basically
non-existent at 10k you're getting rakes
like a quarter of a big blind tip so if
you're just winning one big blind you're
still making 75 dollars every 100 hands
so it'll still kind of show itself so i
just think bankroll
maybe i'm wrong but maybe it comes down
to the you know the innate confidence
then get proved proven wrong afterward
you know i've never played 10k so maybe
i've got to sit down play there realize
okay i was wrong let's just not play
that game again
but you know until i get proven
otherwise i feel like i am
very marginally winning in that game
yeah but also at some point i guess
except for stefan the other guys they
also play 2k 5k so you play already
quite regular against them even 1k some
of them um
except for for stefan actually stefan
also dot
in in a previous podcast also mentioned
stefan and he just said like yeah that
guy
i don't know what he's doing but but but
it's working
that's how he that that's how he
described it
yeah he i played a session with him a
heads up and over like i think 300 hands
which in head's up is reasonable right
you get a lot of over 300 hands is the
equivalent of like 1.5 000 hands and six
max you get like an idea of how they're
playing he was three betting 45
right which is just crazy i mean that's
your opening range in the button he was
three betting against me and then he was
having um his bet sizes post flop were
third half two third pot and two pot
and i would say two pot was his most
common sizing
between them
um so yeah he's just playing a different
game but you know what it
i couldn't really figure out anything
from him apart from i'm not doing that
again because by the end of the hour i
had i i was like so um
not not emotional what's the word where
adrenaline fueled i was just like so
high on the adrenaline from playing
against him because you're just like all
in every [ __ ] two hands yeah but not
quite i made over 300 hands i must have
had like 10 all ins and i ended up just
saying like okay i'm done i can't play
against this guy anymore because you
know maybe maybe objectively i can
compete but i can't because i'm not in
my mindset against him i can't focus
so yeah so it basically i guess he for
the people don't know he plays a over
aggressive style
as you may
as you just mentioned uh is it
in general i would say the better
players they play a more aggressive
style
um what you would say that his style is
so aggressive that it puts people out of
their comfort zone so basically he
induces b and c game of other people
due to his aggressive state playing
stuff yeah and and also like i don't
want to make it seem like if we're both
playing a game i'm competing anyway okay
you know i'm probably not competing even
if i am playing a game against him um
but just for the sheer fact that he
doesn't juice b and c just widens the
gap
um and yeah it's just induced by playing
really really tough i mean like i said
he had all those sizings and tupac was
hand on heart the most common sizing at
least that i experienced
and that was consistent by the way so he
would go two pop flop two pot turn
right so it was just like exponentially
increasing so
single raised bots yeah
yeah
um maybe in three parts i can't i don't
think he was using it three of what's no
actually but in singapore's pots you
would expect ten into five on the flop
and then whatever it was on the turn and
then by the you basically playing the
stack you're quite handcuffed on the
turn
yeah you basically like it
assuming you're playing 100 bb stack
it's like okay now i'm in left in and
members i'll win or full spot
right he just he really really pushes
this and there's one hand where
um i
and there's not yet so he basically went
bet bets bets and then called i was
bluffing i i went check call check call
check jam and he basically called the
bottom of his value bet range
which is obviously terrible in theory
but he won because i was bluffing so it
made me think like god i can't even
[ __ ] get him to fold the bottom of
his value range like
he's just so maybe he didn't know the
theory or maybe he did and then was very
aware of what i was doing uh
psychologically i'm not sure in any case
uh he's just so wonky that i i
definitely had my confidence knocked you
know i played through yeah and that and
that's hard right you're like what the
[ __ ] you you call the bottom of your
range but in the same time you're over
aggressive so i have to play back then
what do i do i cannot bluff the guy
what do i do
felt helpless you know when you play
helpless yeah yeah that is that is
exactly and this is good then about six
max let's say he's at my table i can be
like all right i'll give up i don't know
33 of my range preflop in every spot
same on the flop and then you know his
over aggression will bluff into my
stronger range and i can make more money
versus the other guys at the table but
if you're playing headset
that doesn't work
yeah and also in heads in six max you
can just afford to fold most of your
hands you know you're playing six handed
you're only supposed to be a bit like 25
maybe high for playing in lower rank
environments but it's not that much more
in heads up it's 80. so you can't get
away with just folding 33 too much
because if you do that you're just
losing blinds i mean like you're just
hemorrhaging so much money that you
can't even make it back so yeah he's
he's a complete
like most of the very good players are
all theoretical but he's a complete
outlier and i think um
he's like definitely maybe just the best
in the world i feel like the best three
players are either you know linus make
boyfriend and um stefan at least in cash
games
and i don't you know maybe stefan is is
third place between mate boyfin linus
and him or maybe he's first
you know but like no one really knows
because they really never battle against
one another um
but yeah he's he's a wild card but he's
also very very very good very very very
very good
what do you think of uh very sweet
oh any of the heads-up games yeah yeah
um
he's just obviously he's like a stefan
but
in my opinion
um
barry is like not so solid in theory at
least in no limit theory i don't have no
idea of a pielo um because it's clear he
makes like
pretty not not basic errors but he makes
mistakes however he's just so switched
on intuitively that he makes up for it
who knows how much he makes up for but
it's just clear that he will lock on to
something whether it's a timing tell or
a sizing tell
um or a game flow tell whatever but he
locks on to the in the intuitive side of
the game
and also from what i've heard he does he
just
you know he's been playing poker for so
long he's played so many hands he's like
he's been playing high stakes for so
long that he doesn't really have the
emotional tolls that other players do
where that that is usually also a thing
at higher stakes
more money that that's also for example
something to take in consideration if
you play 10k oh especially in the
beginning new stake
yeah
i think i talked for most players the
first couple of hands at your highest
stake are always a bit jittery in the
beginning you know so
or you are a bit more of a gamble
addicted and that actually fires you up
more money let's go
uh most people are a little bit jittery
so that's also something to take in
consideration when you take a shot at
higher stakes
uh what about the phil hellmuth setup
game
no idea i don't i don't follow any of
that stuff you haven't followed any of
the the white magic movement
no i did see one hand where like
i forget he's like i folded 10 hands in
a row and i get dealt king jack off and
i still make the fold and i was right
and he i don't know some something like
that where he made a really sick fold
pre-flop and he was super elated about
it but it was like a massive punt as
well it's like i'm pretty sure like
negranu opened and he just like opened
folded some hand or something am i right
or am i way off with that i i i i don't
follow it that closely uh but i saw some
i saw some clip of it where he was like
jumping about saying i'm i'm the
greatest i folded this hand it's like
wait there's like literally an open
raise and you fold it
strange
all right not a big helmet fan
i know or at least you know not on a not
nothing technical game yeah yeah yeah
you mentioned uh
um head over aggression for for example
stefan in general i would say over
aggression is harder to play against
because
yeah what is the adjustments versus over
aggression yeah it's not to fault are
you really going to not fault every
every [ __ ] time that's hard it's
really hard you know maybe sometimes
it's easy to then be like he seems a
little bit out of line i have a
frequency call let's just call this 100
the time look at me exploiting that guy
but yeah when someone is so aggressive
the correct strategy is literally or at
least you know if we play on the river
not to fault right you either reblock
him or you you you cannot fault but
people do fault right you have to fall
at some point so it's very hard to play
again so
besides aggression what do you think is
another characteristics that these
high-stakes the good high-sex players
have in common
i think they're very structured in their
game
um
that's something that i would like to
think that i do a good job of as well is
that i don't make things up on the fly
occasionally you have to because the
spot's weird
um but you know a lot of the time you're
just playing a game that you already
have a good idea of
so yeah i would say i mean stefan's
definitely an outlier because he does
things differently he's very tricky and
he makes the game tree you know he very
deliberately skews that game tree but a
lot of the players who are very very
good play the same game tree
you know in fact if you if you actually
rail the high stake heads up games on
poker stars and then you bring up the
hand history replay you'll see that if
you organize it by pot size you get the
same pot sizes as a pattern so you get
like five of the same pot size and then
it jumps down to the next one basically
you know the the category of stingray's
pot that it was because they're using
the same sizings they're having same bet
bet sizing patterns whereas like a
weaker player might not even use hotkeys
and they might just like you know
deliberately type out the numbers
and then you get this you know less less
of a pattern of pot sizes so i think
like yeah
structure overall they know what they're
doing when i'm coaching myself i'm
always doing you know
i'm not just jumping about the game tree
so if i'm coaching someone is going to
be right this session singer race pop in
position on the flop next session singer
race part in position on the turn so
there's a very deliberate theme going on
and i think that's the way to learn
poker at the higher level obviously at
lower level you can go about it in many
different ways but at the higher level i
think you need that structure and
and and
yeah overall understanding of what's
going on
i completely agree
um
my last question for you and then i'll
hand you over to adam and then i think
we're gonna
close it off
in an introduction
uh you mentioned that you contribute a
lot of your success to
hard work
good work ethic you also mentioned you
believe that anyone can achieve
anything if you just put your mind into
it or as you mentioned in the beginning
you go just all in in one thing
what piece of advice would you want to
give
the audience who's listening who's
trying to walk the same path as you are
walking to make it towards high stakes
cool nice question um
firstly uh okay um let's just say it's
like a bullet point way of answering
firstly
um
you're probably not as smart as you
think you are everyone goes through this
maybe there are a couple savants
listening to it but you know everyone is
not as smart as they think they are i
think when they start playing poker
secondly you got to be consistent with
it and therefore patient so you know if
you're playing poker don't just hope to
make money in the next month or two
right it's a long long long term game
here so
uh consistency and believe in yourself
even though i've just said you know
you're probably not smart as what you
think you are still don't think you're
an idiot who can't compete at the level
above you right every end of the day you
are playing against humans and
hopefully right and um
there isn't they're not this like i
remember i was playing lower stakes like
10 and 25 i thought guys at 200 and 500
are just like machines they're really
really good they understand every spot
and then you start playing that it's
like wait a second
like i'm competitive in this pool and i
still have so many holes in my game so
to anyone who's playing lower stakes
let's say you're playing 10 25 50 100
and you're looking at guys at 500 and a
thousand
or 600 an hour whatever those guys who
you're looking up two still have massive
holes in their game i have massive hours
in my game and renee you have massive
house too and adam do you i don't know
if you're playing poker anymore or you
you've made no no right but when you
were playing you had mass if i was in
your game and you were still a
successful professional so everyone has
holes even even the best like lioness
and berry have holes they just have less
of them and the holes are smaller but
they're still there they're still still
present in everyone's game so i'd say
believe in yourself but mainly just the
patience you've got to be consistent and
be patient if you're like if you're very
impatient which i am then it's going to
be tough because you're going to be kind
of waiting for those results but instead
try and look at poker in a sense of an
environment of learning so every day
that you play every hand that you play
every study session that you do you are
just building on your career and that
does mean sometimes that you work your
arse off for a month and you end up
less better off than you were at the
start of the month because variance
happens but that doesn't mean that
you're actually less better off in terms
of like your ability you could be a much
better poker player but less financially
well off because of
bad run at the tables so i would say i
try and not think of things as a metric
of how many dollars did you make or lose
that's important
a lot of wisdom there adam do you have
any final questions for our guest clinty
i've got one final question
we talked a bit before about your
approach to studying and grinding how
you kind of split your hours and you
mentioned like how important balance is
to you and also health and fitness for
your life so yeah i think it'd be really
nice for our listeners to uh
for you to walk through a day in the
life what's a day in the life look like
on a poker day and maybe if your off day
is very different you could experience
as well but how do you approach your
your ideas
yeah sure so uh my average my average
playing day i play
um wednesday thursday saturday sunday i
take monday tuesday off for coaching and
then friday off as just kind of like a
recovery day um after
playing on wednesday thursday so let's
say on my
thursday
i will wake up somewhere between seven
and nine
and usually have a morning routine which
is just kind of normal stuff normal
mundane things chill for an hour plan
the day that will usually be
study my first 25 to 50
in two 25 minute blocks
play for four hours
as soon as i finish playing i always
just go out for a walk if the weather's
crap i go i still go for a run or
something
unless it's really bad or something but
yeah i always always always always get
out because for me i find that getting
out is the most important thing after a
grind i used to try and like lock myself
in to do some journaling or something
after a session but i found that
checking just do the journey after when
i get back so after a session i'll go
out for a walk or a run
and when i get back have food do a
journal practice which is just simply
like um how was my discipline how well
did i play
what are some things that you did well
something didn't do well very very
simple um do some session review on that
on on the session
and um then maybe chill play some video
games or something depending on
something else on it might be like a
study session with ben or something like
that
and
that's basically day over after that
that's usually
nine ten o'clock chill and then go to
bed so it starts with morning routine
study play
fitness journal study and then during
the evening
great stuff i liked how you said you
realize the importance of getting away
from your computer and getting outdoors
i think that's a very uh i think a lot
of players know that they should but i
think it's a very over
utilized approach where a lot of players
will just stay at the computer or stay
indoors wait too much of the day so you
already like that you're prioritizing
that as part of your your daily
performance routines and yeah like you
said like you can journal after you can
do performance review after you can look
up behind the screens after you do
another study session anything come
after but i do think having that break
outdoors away from your computer is very
good so how long is your walk is it like
20 minutes 30 minutes or what's a rough
walking time for you
it depends sometimes you go for a hike
and it's you know a couple of hours i
usually
if it's a run just 15 minutes if it's a
walk usually an hour because i've got a
few parks behind me also as well if you
don't if you're like so
focused on wanting to do the studying
then actually what you can do is you can
just do the studying while you're on the
walk you can just literally email
yourself i mean this is how i do it i
email myself the industries my phone and
i can just like look at the look at the
industry and then think about as i'm
walking so you can even passively study
while you're walking if you want to
usually i don't that's i mean very
rarely do i do that i've done that a
couple of times usually in my walk
though i'm just kind of um
i mean i don't know if you've ever been
to heaton park adam yeah
yeah so you know how nice that is so you
can just uh you can walk through there
you've got heathen park armstrong park
jasmine park you've got loads of nice
parks so i'm just kind of walking in
and enjoying that and i find that
actually at that point i don't really
want to think about poker i'm usually
thinking about some other things so yeah
very nice yeah he didn't so we talked
offline looks living very close to him i
was brought up and hidden parks gorgeous
i used to actually do um 5k races around
hidden park used to be on like once a
year probably what time of year i was
going to be december time did a nice 5k
race around the park uh yeah really
really nice area so yeah when you've got
that option to go outdoors and get in in
nature i think as a poker player we need
to realize that we need to look after
ourselves a lot and yeah i think his
time outdoors is a very under
underutilized approach for a lot of
players i think especially online
players can spend way too much of their
net time of the day at a computer like
you said if you want you can multitask
it you can let the brain run over here
histories you can multitask by looking
over stuff let's let the brain think
over spots that have came up and then
once you get back your mind is a really
good place to actually solve those
problems so how does your days look when
you're not grinding would you do
anything different on your after you do
but how does it non-poker day look
yeah so i
um monday tuesday i don't do my 25 to 50
my studying i do that on the friday but
not on the monday tuesday monday tuesday
is coaching so i will have one session i
used to do two but i've reduced to
coaching now so i only do one session a
day depends on what time that is maybe
it's a guy um
in asia sometimes i go in the u.s and it
depends i'll just kind of work around
their schedule
so otherwise it will be wake up and do
first in coaching
or i'll do other things the other things
are
going for a walk doing real life chores
doing personal training
and then studying
um on the friday so there's not much
else to do as i try to just detox if i
can which i i wish i would do more would
be watch a movie because i really enjoy
watching movies but i usually find that
i don't have the time to do that
although to be fair i always find the
time to go for a walk and have pt so i
could probably could do better at just
finding time to watch a movie but um
yeah i would say the i would just not
play and instead i would introduce the
the pt slash video games into my i'd
weave that into the day
and just normal chores as well you know
normal things
are your sessions with a personal
trainer at the gym do you go to a gym to
train yeah
yeah yeah some sometimes we go for a run
uh but most mostly um
um wednesdays we do
cardio and then fridays we do weights
yeah nice how long have you been
exercising regularly for
about a year actually i lost a lot of
weight last year um also you know if the
guys who are watching who
who um who are getting to poker and
don't appreciate the time away i mean i
can speak firsthand i i quite literally
dropped out of school played video games
was really unhealthy put on a bunch of
weight right i was the um like epitome
of a guy who was was unfit and addicted
to video games and i trust me
getting outdoors is just
such a benefit it doesn't even need to
be that you go outdoors for hours and
hours but just quite literally even just
going for a 15 minute walk you'll just
feel so much better for it and all
you've got to do i always think is just
like all you got to do is put on the
shoes and once you put on the shoes
you'll leave the door you know no one
puts on their shoes and then thinks ah
[ __ ] it unless it's like you know
[ __ ] out outside it's rubbish
weather but all you got to do is put on
the shoes and then you'll leave then
you'll go for a nice walk and come back
um and yeah just working out that kind
of came over time at first it was just i
want to get fit
and i'm not motivated to do that by
myself so i hired a trainer and then
over time i've that's kind of
come on leaps and bounds and it's it's
just it's gone from just wanting to lose
weight to wanting to be fit to wanting
to put on muscle but that was a very
gradual process you know i never
actually thought i would actually want
to put on muscle i was just happy being
fit
but yeah it's kind of come on over time
i like that i like the evolution from
simply getting outdoors getting some
fresh air to wanting to lose some weight
to want to get a bit fitter and i want
to put a muscle it's like an evolution
and then i think the final kind of place
to get to is where you exercise just
because you want to feel good you want
to just feel good in yourself i think
along the way you get more more kind of
snippets of kind of the kind of goals
you want to achieve for fitness but i
think getting outdoors is a really
really big one and myself i go for a
morning walk every day and i got a dog
recently i said like a year ago we found
a dog i mean my girlfriend's and it
wasn't very good condition we were gonna
look after it and then give it a foster
home but then once we got attached to it
and now i love the accountability every
morning the dog's like scratching the
door going come take for a walk 15 20
minutes is generally the average walk
day and even though i live like five
minutes from the beach it wasn't for the
dog there's no way i'd be going for as
many walks i do so i basically don't
miss a day so yeah any excuse you can
find to go for some sort of outdoor time
like you said it doesn't need to be a
big commitment and i can't think of any
example of going for a walk where i was
like that was a waste of time shouldn't
have done that almost always it's like a
net positive in the short term so yeah i
think it's one of those things that you
need to build it into the system of your
deer because it's one of those things
when you're in workflow you're stressed
out you're doing stuff sometimes the
last thing you want to do is actually
just take a break and go for a walk even
though it's the best thing for you just
like building that rhythm in your day
i'm sure for you like having it after
your session consistently makes it
easier to do because you know okay
finish my session go for the walk
whereas you can't pick a part of the day
where it goes randomly so yeah i think
it's good to have that structure
throughout your day so yeah great stuff
running any parting questions any final
kind of questions on your mind
no i think it's uh it makes a lot of
sense right that if you graduate
gradually get more fit you start to feel
better yeah you are what you want to
feel even better and more often so then
you want to get even fitter right that's
kind of the the addiction i guess that
starting to live healthier
uh kind of has an impact on you i
remember for example when i started to
stop or significantly reduce drinking
because i didn't want to waste a day
being hangover i hate the feeling of
being hangover they're not being able to
be productive so nowadays i rarely drink
anymore because i like the way i feel so
same for example i don't do any stimulus
anymore nowadays because i just like to
feel like the regular me and yeah i
think it makes a lot of sense once you
start to feel better you don't want to
go back
yeah
so do you have any final uh things that
you would like to share luke
um no i think the actually yeah one
thing so
there is a i don't know if you could
link this in the in the description
relate but it'd be great if you could
there's a relevance video that's free to
watch
it's called
my best advice to a low stakes grinder
and
um
it's basically yeah my my best advice so
it comes it includes things like
bankrupt management game selection um if
you're going to play theory or exploit
or both
mainly not making you um kind of like
feel overwhelmed by the decision and
yeah and that's a video that i feel
strongly about so if you are i mean
honestly it's tailored toward the the
beginner poker players but if you are
even playing mid stakes i think you
could still learn a thing or two just
sometimes uh even even very good players
can kind of miss basic things like hey
rake's really really high like a gg
poker break is super super high yeah
it's a really really popular site and i
think objectively that's just poor um
you mean even preflop you're getting
raked so i think there was um
a post the other day on on two plus two
where something like of of the 50 top
volume grinders uh the majority of them
are losing whereas there's not during
every other site so that speaks volumes
just to uh game selection right there
and then you know so
uh yeah that would be something that i
would like to
plug if anything i'm a coach and run it
once but that one is is a free view so i
think all you've got to do is make an
account but no money has to be parted
you can just make an account and then
you can watch that one for free
all right yeah we'll make sure the the
link is here down below in the
description
great thank you
other than that there was something that
i didn't mention as well is um
going back a couple of years when you
started the academy
and you had um guys like tunis in your
academy right
there was an era at least to me maybe
this is a short-term thing you know you
sometimes you have the short-term
friends and someone and they're really
really tough but there was an era i
think around 2019 2020 where there was
uh nyatma
am i saying his name right nietmar yeah
it's it's a dutch name so well well
pronounced it literally says not two but
three but then in dutch how do you say
then you get neat twai maya
okay not going to try that one
so she had that name tunis which i'm
probably saying wrong and then another
guy
kempi yep and then there was
steve mobs there
guys
yeah but i didn't find them too tough
there were the four guys i think there
might have been one other guy as well um
oh mbr yeah yeah yeah those those guys
were my nemesis for a long time we did
it because
because they were so annoying i felt
like i couldn't win um so i want to i
know so and tunis was a long time you
know redline losing player and then you
you turned them into
red line crushing player but like all
lions winning so i just want to say
props to that because for a long time
that was the goal
yeah the dutch crew as as i called them
were really really really tough so
that was that was a hard time in poker
where you kept you you trained all these
guys back then you weren't doing any
twitch or youtube you were just kind of
everything was no yeah we were just like
focusing on on improving them yeah yeah
so props to that i think you were you
were like definitely market leaders at
that point where there was the only
things that i could see were your
instagram posts so
everyone in a in like a conference like
a real life conference yeah yeah because
they were all done so we were doing it
live on location
yeah
that was definitely like i felt out
cluster props that was really really
impressive i really enjoyed um being on
the podcast glad you finally did it
after my downswing and recovery um but
yeah it was it was nice to speak to you
guys not viewing you on a video but
actually being part of the conversation
because i've listened to the other the
other pods what happened to you you made
a few more but they're they're
gone on youtube i don't know if i can
ask that but i feel like there was more
am i wrong are there did you make pods
that have now been removed or am i just
completely misremembering ah no we are
probably referring to pots that we have
already recorded but that they're not
yet uploaded yet for example at the
moment that we speak
okay today the
the paths episode will come on and in
two weeks we will release the episode
with that and then two weeks from then
you
so
we were we were speaking about things we
were in
you were you were talking about the rene
from the future at some point in that
episode yeah this was renee and adam
from the future talking about the
episodes that you were like hey are they
in the parallel universe what the [ __ ]
is going on
no it's very impressive so that explains
that that explains it we usually uh
sometimes have have someone on but then
we upload it in a certain schedule
all right then uh i would like to thank
you for being on uh there was a lot of
wisdom i'm gonna repeat myself i usually
say this towards the end but it's true
uh we also try to get guests on that
we're very interested in having on so
that's why i guess it's always an
interesting conversation i really loved
a couple of your your point of view
especially the variance one really stick
with me i'm sure i'm gonna
i'm gonna keep that one in my mind that
olympic athletes or i think adam gave
the example of djokovic yeah they have
real variants we as cash game players
have nothing to complain about basically
okay
so i would like to thank you for being
on and i would like to thank
no yeah i would like to thank you for
being on
no problem i really enjoyed being here
what a bomb of wisdom did mr luke clanty
johnson just drop on us
i mean
adam you as a mindset performance coach
i would say that this is the example of
someone with the right mentality am i
correct
i feel like we talked about a lot of
kind of obstacles he faced in his career
but in all honesty he never saw him that
way basically every time he approached
anything that would be classed as a
challenge for most players he backed
himself he had a lot of self belief for
example moving upstairs very
effortlessly he instilled the confidence
that i can beat this game i'm good
enough and as a result he didn't tell
himself any negative stories about why
the game was gonna be too hard for him
why he couldn't beat it if anything he
told himself the opposite he said
because i beat the level below i'll
build a beat level above and a common
theme line throughout the whole
conversation was almost being unaffected
by anything that's going on around him
being very confident in his approach to
poca learning and proving and almost
like i don't think we got one real big
obstacle out of him in terms of
something that was classed as that was
really really challenging really
difficult for me because he just doesn't
frame it that way he never saw anything
as a something he couldn't overcome and
then on top of that he had this
competitive drive where he always wants
to get better at something so when he's
in a tough player pool for example
that's when some people might start to
doubt their game for him that turns on
his height by competitive nature and he
wants to prove that he can actually beat
these guys and it was very interesting
you guys were talking about recreational
players and he almost like switches off
a bit so yeah he really needs that
competitive side of himself to uh to get
better so yeah really really good stuff
about yeah i think the main ones i got
were having that instilled belief system
that you can beat the games and you can
make it make it work you can find a way
to get better i've worked with hundreds
of players now and it's very uncommon
right so normally players will beat a
stake and then they will go to the next
stake and their confidence goes back to
zero it's almost like oh well
the story starts running going well this
these guys are better they're more
aggressive
they're going to be hard to beat and
they tell us all these stories so then
they have a bit of bad variance so they
run into some tough scenarios and that
reinforces a narrative that they already
went in there with he was the inverse of
that he was going in going right i could
beat this game because i beat the last
game so there's no way these guys are
better than me even in the end you talk
about what you need to do to play the
10k games and he said i beat them now it
was like straight up i could beat them
now it just get me in that pool just
mangrove thing so even to the very days
he's reinforcing i'm good enough now now
in the future i'm good enough right now
to beat the game so yeah really really
good and the final thing for me was his
ability to play to his strengths so he
credited solvers quite a lot but i think
the self-awareness to know wait a second
i'm very very good at learning
strategies this way by using solvers and
like basically trying to see how the
heuristics he was seeing of their
players that works really really well
for me so i'm going to build my whole
game around that i'm really really going
to get good at that in the creative side
which i'm not good at forget it i'm not
even going to try to get it being
creative or intuitive obviously he did
say that he's got some intuitive nature
but in general he's business game much
more around a gt to your framework which
is very similar to what the conversation
we had with pads in a previous podcast
when he was basically saying be a good
version of you don't be a bad virgin
somebody else and i think clanty's
really enforced that he's from a very
very good version of him he's got a very
very good logical thinker using gto
frameworks and that's how he's optimized
his performance so yeah i'm really
impressed with everything about clanty
and his approach to poker i think the
mindset is super super strong like
definitely getting good grades from me
on his overall approach how about
yourself renee what was some of the
takeaways from the conversation
yeah and i wanted to highlight that
so throughout your career right you face
obstacles and i'm sure he has faced as
well
but exactly he didn't tell himself that
story or he didn't get lost in that
story and it didn't become a
self-fulfilling prophecy where as you
said you take a shot at a higher stake
and you're looking for a reason why you
don't belong here you take a shot at
homo but you're looking for a reason why
you don't belong you find yourself in a
spot where you don't know what to do
yeah you see i'm not yet ready go back
to safety to 50 now he didn't have that
okay and he clearly said yeah what this
differentiated me was i didn't put a cap
on the stake that i was going to play
right a lot of people capped themselves
unconsciously probably right due to fear
so this is definitely something if you
if you struggle that's definitely
definitely something you would need to
work on
um
also in terms of uh i mean we heard the
name stefan right also i think in the
last podcast with dot usually rated as
one of the better players very
aggressive and in general just very hard
to play very aggressive players so if
you have trouble with aggression
definitely something also you should try
to dig deeper into where is the
resistance coming from uh in regards to
aggression also
uh i really liked his thought on
variance right he said yeah most poker
players we think that we have such high
variance but then he put that in
perspective by comparing it with for
example the world cup it's only you you
could train for four years you still
depend on 10 other people yeah that's
crazy so next time i hit variance i'm
gonna have perspective uh realizing that
other players have it way worse than me
great stuff
