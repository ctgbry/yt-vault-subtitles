when it comes to
when it when it comes to dealing with
adversity
now me as a mid-30 year old that is
emotionally more regulated I would say
the the biggest piece of advice is that
your emotions don't have to guide your
actions and that's a very important
distinction to make so your emotions are
all good and fine but as the moment it
starts guiding your behavior that's the
problem so it's not about becoming a
robot and just removing emotions all
together because you're going to suffer
way more by doing that then then by
trying to control them it is more about
understanding that you can feel any way
you want but your actions are are not
connected to that oftentimes which is
called discipline right so okay I don't
feel like doing this well it doesn't
matter you don't have to feel like it
doesn't have to be fun it doesn't have
to make you happy right now like all it
it doesn't have to do anything you just
have to do it basically
