gotta do something fancy here
[Music]
what's up youtube welcome to this very
first video here on the poker ambition
channel
now for those of you who don't know me
or are not familiar with the poker
ambition brand
let me give you guys a very quick
introduction i'm renee
better known as the weko online i've
been playing professional poker for
over 10 years now started off playing
free walls working my way all the way up
to the highest stakes in online cash
games
now after completing the road to high
stakes ourselves
we decided to start poker ambition where
we've been helping a group of cash game
players do exactly the same
our next goal is to help to teach the
rest of the world how to get poker
success
as well not only in cash games but also
an
entities sitting goes you name it
because in the end
poker is poker it's the same game now to
start off this direction in the right
way
i decided to record a session of you
guys where i've been playing some 500 ml
zoom
now instead of just going in and playing
and showing you a lot of nice place
i decided to give this video a little
bit of a theme
and that is where does my ev have to
come from
i think modern a poker is a bit too
stuck in the mindset of okay what do i
have to do here what does the solver do
how do i play gto and we kind of get
we kind of lose the the main objective
while playing a hand which is
basically making as much money
eevee as possible the better players
they ask themselves these questions and
come up with better answers
therefore choose the right decision
while playing a hand
you can generate ev in many different
ways for example if you play against a
knit
who's overfolding you're bluffing him
more if you play against the station
you will bluff him less you know it's
things that you're already doing
now obviously this is quite superficial
and you can go
deep deep deep deeper down the layers
and it will get a bit more complicated
but what i will do is i will play a
session
and i will try to come back to this
question as much as possible
showing you my thought process and why i
take a certain
line and why i think that line has the
most ev
so without further ado let's get into
the action
so i'm not going to try to state the
obvious
too much
and we'll try to only comment on what i
think is
relevant queen unsuited
versus a half but see that don't really
want to race
getting re-raised would be disastrous
i want to just go ahead and call and
realize our equity
turn is interesting
if he checks uh we will probably have a
mixed strategy
there are some hands that would want to
bet small to get some protection of like
like king 10 but at the same time we
also have another advantage with
some two pairs some sets some six
some straights if you check so probably
those ingredients would lead to a mixed
strategy
but a queen ein i think is a pure fault
queen to be suited
i'll be playing a mixed strategy from
the small blind
don't think
either one strategy or the other is
better
it depends on your execution do you
execute a limb strategy in a bad way
it's worse than a race only and vice
versa
and you will hear me see this quite a
lot
i see i've watched a lot of videos on a
lot of players say it's close
everything is closed and they just do
whatever
there's some truth to that because
multiple strategies
can have high eva i mean if you look at
a solver
evs don't really vary that much when you
look at strategies
the execution of the strategy is always
going to be the turn the determining
factor
and how much ev you're expected to make
with a strategy
so race only mixed
doesn't really matter i guess what you
could say is
don't play 80 vpip in race only
and they'll play 30 percent vp in the
mix strategy from the small blind
those are like two extremes that i think
are obviously
bad but from there you can kind of go
either way
um
this isn't here the face checks back
i'm just gonna take a step at a pot i
think it's a spot where we're to have to
step twice quite a lot
due to villain probably
having a bunch of continues on the turn
i was actually quite surprised
he was folding so i think that's
actually also an
important spot here versus a 2.2 i'm
gonna go for a cold call
i see many players like to play three
but only
from the small blind in general you will
see this
i'm not really a static player i guess
um i mean he opened to 2.2
so i don't think having a flatting range
is bad actually i think it's it's
probably good
on the turn i think we're gonna use a
polarized strategy
so that's what i will do i think we have
an advantage
in most hands
after it gets checked around
six for off is usually a fault um
this player is on the more aggressive
side so against him i will definitely
fault
because my realization will be way less
than for example versus a passive player
or versus a fish
for example you would call six four
suits versus fish uh
due to your playability being better
and it's not only against a fish i think
also this is a
mistake i see a lot of players make uh
it's i'm gonna open a7 here i don't know
this guy
it doesn't have to be a wreck
it would be quite a loose open but what
i'm trying to say is with the six were
off
um i think
people like to differentiate in between
wrecks they have rags or fish
uh i personally i mean you see multiple
colors coming by
i like to tack racks in maybe like four
colors and fish as well like four colors
and then i even have like an in between
color
because certain player types certain
hands play differently
ace two is off against a 2.2
i'm going to call would have opened a
bit bigger i would have folded
but yeah i think touching straight on to
some topics that i think
are interesting um
is the fact that i think
modern day poker is played too static we
try to think in rules
we either do this all the time we do
this and then you have the other players
who are non-static but they do
everything
based on rng
shout out to the rng i mean i have rng
running here
i think the rg is fine if you don't have
reach
for example i'm playing quite readless
here
so then i think an rng can definitely
come in handy but
you either have the camp that randomized
too often and then you have the camp
that are too static
and you might have guessed it i think
the truth is somewhere in the middle
and i think this is due to the way
people approach poker
they try to simplify it for themselves
try to create rules but
it lacks deeper learning of the game i
would say
um
[Music]
versus the fish here i'm gonna build a
big pot
i think that seems like a smart thing to
do
see if it's half but um
yeah we have quite a strong hand i don't
have any reads
on this villain that say would be super
aggressive then maybe i would do
something else
but i think a hand as strong as ace nine
to jump into the theme of the video
where does my eevee have to come from
when we have two pair there even if
venom is quite aggressive our ev doesn't
necessarily have to come from his
aggression
because we can value better ourselves
and get called by worse hands quite
easily
let's say for example we have a hand
that's weaker than ace nine so two pair
let's say we have h5
h5 would be a hand oh actually h5 would
also never check with let's say is jack
we could check razer check all
that hand would clearly become a check
call when he becomes more aggressive
threes here is quite a loose open
but i think on that table it's fine same
for four do suited
there's a i think it's a fish in the big
blind
so then i think it's a fine open
and i'm gonna go for like a a min bed on
this mono board
in general monitor boards you want to
use small sizings
um
don't think having a 10 here is great
because we're blocking hands that he
would
fault to a barrel i think a patchat bat
seems like the smartest option
he bets himself so then i think we have
an easy fault
no reason to raise her with the 10-4
like i said the reason that the 10 was
bad in the barrel is the same reason why
a 10 would be bad
in the river race line because we are
blocking hands that he would most likely
bluff with
but yeah so the staticness of players
or the too much rng or too much
randomizing of players
is because of a leg of our understanding
of where
ev comes from and a lack of a deeper
understanding i think how the game
works
and
with them a couple of questionnaires
and one of the biggest pain points of
the modern day poker population
is that they yeah they don't
they lack understanding of why certain
things work in a certain way
[Music]
this hand here is quite interesting
could do two things
i think this one would go for a big bet
some of the time and go for a check
i think it's either a big bet or a check
that i think is what makes most sense
here we have like the nuts with backup
equity
so i think it's a good spot to go for an
overbet
and i think here we're just gonna check
fold i think it was
like ace queen where does ev come from
with ace queen
a screen is kind of a sucky hand like we
can bet big
as a bluff but basically we never get a
better hand to fold
and never really get a i mean we get a
worse hand to call i guess
like a flush draw it's also too thin to
value bet
or too weak develop but for a small
sizing so i think
after he calls the three bet he's
already quite
strong in these positions so i think
check folding or betting big would have
been the
the two options
we play limb but pl one two three seven
i don't know he is but he leads out
interesting play
i think we can peel once
the eraser is quieted
neutralize board i think with the three
five three five is a hand that kind of
sucks especially he completes so the
five is not really a great hand to have
we block some bluffs and our improves
aren't that clean
uh given it's a limp bot so we can have
a hand like loose five off suit for
example
three is i think check always is the way
to go
i think going check raise bad bad i mean
we're quite
deep we don't have the nuts
so i think our ev shouldn't come from
going check raise that bad i think then
what is
left is maybe a
yeah basically better hands
he does an over bet which i think is
interesting maybe actually i'll go for a
race here
the reason i did raise a turn is
basically
he could have over bet the turn i mean
he had multiple options there it was
again a spot
where he has another advantage
so usually when you have another
advantage there is a big sizing involved
doesn't mean you only have to be big
because there's quite a lot of hands
that would benefit from uh
from
from benning smaller like the
three-quarters bot let's say for example
he hasn't had like sixes or sevens
five six five seven uh maybe eight seven
those are all hands that want to bet but
not necessarily for an overbet
so then what happens is um
yeah you you get a mixed strategy
when he doesn't uh the reason i didn't
want to check razorflop is because we
still have a lot of streets to play
we still have quite a lot of streets to
play
and basically on the turn a safeguard
arrived
so we have more equity versus his range
given the fact that he better the three
quarter sizing i thought the check race
would be uh
would be a good play
i think this is something that uh
it's like deeper step dynamics it's
something that
obviously mtt players will have uh
less experience with
and what i often see is that they try to
get too much money in
when they are deeper basically
i have to watch out what i say that that
i don't get the whole ftt community on
my back
uh but basically it's more like
i have a strong hand let's build a pot
and they don't necessarily build a pot
from the perspective of okay where does
my ep have to come from
i think this hand is a good hand to bet
i think i had like king jack
which i think a lot of hands would
probably bet
i'm gonna do something fancy here
basically yeah that was the only
downside of my play
uh but basically what i was trying to do
is
uh trying to look quite polarized there
with the ace 10.
if he had a hand like if he did have had
like jack queen or king jack which i
thought was unlikely so i thought that
10 would probably be the best hand
he has quite a poor bluff catcher
whereas if he has eight or nines
against the two and a half time spot he
has quite a good blood catcher
so it was a
on the river as we call it and basically
you merge
when you can get a better hand to fold
and a worse hand to call
and the bigger eye size the more
polarized i become
the better
yeah the better eights and nines become
as bluff catches around like 10 9
10 8 and the more i had like king jack
becomes a full unfortunately
he has ace jack some of the time yeah
and then we don't really have a great
hand
he went for the check race with jack
eight which is on the loser side
um but i would check i would check
uh three bet jack 8 suited a big portion
of the time and i think jack 8 here is
quite a good combo as it
um it will connect on basically any turn
queen the jack 9 7
5 it has a lot of connectivity so
basically when you pick a hand to check
raise look at
uh future possibilities and i thought
the jack 8 would be a great
hand for a check race based on those
factors
check 5 i think it's a
it's a kind of love or whatever and
i think this is also an important point
like the kind of the whatever
like i said it's something that you hear
quite often now it's it's it's like
whatever
um
the whatevers don't mean that you should
just use your random knowledge
direct the the whatever is mean
that evs are close and when evs are
close you have to ask yourself the
question where does my iv come from so
for example
um with the jackfast suited if i would
have a read on my opponent that is a bit
better
than i would always fault if i have read
in my opponent that he's a bit worse
maybe a bit more passive
i would always call
a screen suited with three beds with a
phaser four but i think it's quite
standard
if you see bets
it's interesting i don't think if i jam
he will fold ace king
so i don't really think by jamming i can
get better hands to fold
would have also been interesting if he
checks i think it's a great spot to
check
race with ace king
[Music]
they didn't do it so i think calling is
kind of the option that's left we never
have to fold the turn
i think that's good he checks turn i
think it's quite a similar story i don't
think ace king will fold
um so then basically all we do with
betting is
getting called by worse and letting
better better hand folds the benefit of
betting though is that we will never get
bluffed on the river because
obviously we need to improve in order
for us to call
he checks again
[Music]
i don't yeah not really sure if ace king
would fold
[Music]
i think this is all we could do with our
hand
realize
[Music]
an attorney is not falling flop is not
falling river is debatable
defaults united suited or something does
get there
so wall do you really know who this guy
is but
we go all the way anyway
we can three bet we can fault we can
call
which means the table dynamics for
example become quite important
this hand check my suit i think i will
always three bet
earlier i three better jack nine suited
which he also opened small i think could
also be a great
an easy hand to call i went for the
three bed that time
and you will see me use
rngs for pre-flop at a higher frequency
because like i said i'm playing sort of
readless
and as i also stated it it is true
that evs are close either way
so that it doesn't really matter i'm
gonna go for the limb brace with ace
king
i'm gonna go to quite a small sizing
i think if you look at this range i
think that's the range he gets most
that's the sizing that this range gets
most trouble with
i think this is a good spot to
fire out some big bets
and the limp pod i'm gonna probably go
for
high frequency bet on this board queen
nine deuce quite a good board for me
goes for a small race which puts my
hands
[Music]
puts my hand in kind of a ugly spot if i
had a back door i would call
maybe i should be calling this maybe i
can do some leading on like a 10 a jacka
king etc etc
but usually if people make a small race
on the board that i already had an
advantage
[Music]
yeah i'm not really too concerned
but i wouldn't be surprised if 7 8 would
call sometimes if you would implement
some aggression on turn cards that are
favorable for me like
i was i was considering the 10 in the
jack because the tenant the jack
would complete broadways and in a limp
pod he is most likely to raise
broadway's preflop
so that gives me a range advantage and
from a ranged advantage you can usually
apply
pressure because you have hands that our
opponent doesn't have
[Music]
this end can be a three bet or a call
i'm gonna call this time because i have
a fissure and a big blind
which basically increases my
[Music]
increases the ev of my call
[Music]
i went for a race here with h5 i think
if we have h5 with backdoors or
something we have a fine hand to call
with
without the practice i think it's a bit
too weak um
so then it becomes either a fault or a
race i think fold is usually the play
but you know
i don't mind the race another turn we
pick up some equity
uh i decided to go for the small bet
usually when you pick up equity in this
kind of situation you have to be quite
careful because the spr becomes quite
small
meaning we will get check race quite a
lot which kind of sucks for a hand like
[Music]
h5
[Music]
i think then jack here is a handed okay
definitely
bets we do need i mean
protection is a little bit of a big of a
word
but you know he has some queen eyes and
king eyes that are gonna fold which is
great
river is quite interesting i think we
should
maybe go for a small bed
[Music]
he didn't bite
[Music]
so where should evie come from in this
situation
i decided to go for the small bet i
think a jack will always race so we
don't lose value from that
he could still bluff race the thing with
the limp pod
scenario here is that he's gonna have
land like deuce five off maybe
and against that hand we
probably want to check
but he also has some king highs and
queen heists that could call versus a
one bed that would check behind
so this is kind of the debate you have
to weigh
in consideration in your in your mind
a good general rule is when you
doubt between betting and checking
betting small is
i found usually quite a good solution
because it kind of fetches the best of
both worlds
[Music]
get a barrel here i'm gonna go again
with the ace ten we still have some
showdown value with ace high
we dominate his draws
river is quite interesting it's quite a
good card for us
[Music]
it's a very good card for us actually
[Music]
i'm gonna go for a small block bed here
on the river
i think that then
[Music]
maybe like i think the board does give
us some advantage but
you know we're quite vulnerable also for
races
so then the solution could either be to
check and not dunk that
that's obviously one or the solution
would be to just
size down a little bit more i already
went from 1 30 to 20 but
maybe we could have even went smaller
this hand could race call limp call
nothing limp raising is an option
[Music]
interesting turn
i'm gonna bet again i'm gonna size down
a little bit because
the board's getting quite scary
and remember we talked about looking at
these advantages and
in a limb pot like the 5'3 off the 5 8
off
our hands that or the 4 6 of our hands
that he will have and i don't
and in general if you start to build a
big pot and put a lot of money in the
pot when your opponent has way more nut
combos than you
even if he doesn't
try to exploit that
then it's probably still not a great
idea
[Music]
hi hello board is quite good for the in
position 3 better so we're going to go
for a small sizing
you will have quite a lot of pocket
pairs that are
going to have trouble defending so i
think on the flop we have quite a print
spot
and with our exact holding we will
probably continue with firing
here with kings the board is mono
which always means that you know if a
diamond hits
[ __ ] hits the fan
and go for a check think with kings that
is fine
ryan doesn't really need much protection
we want him to hit a pair with like like
jack queen
spades or jack of spades and a queen of
hearts or something
and he might decide to bluff at some
point
[Music]
he didn't really bet i think i think
he's going to just fold a lot
but i'll still squeeze in a small bed
let me cover with six five it's a it's a
board where it's just quite hard to get
a lot of value
from worst hands especially when you're
deeper
i think it's important to delay your
aggression for later street
[Music]
the poo has gotten quite tough
[Music]
not playing the jack 9 suited there
okay we get a dog bed here from the
fishy dunks out 99
jack i think i should proceed by calling
he checks is quite interesting
[Music]
i'm to bed once
uh i thought there was a chance that
well
if there was a chance he could be
dogmatic like a low pocket pair or
some really meant like ace high so i
think on the turn we can make him fold
those kind of hands
if he does check all the turn i think
i'm done with the hand
i think he's most likely going to have a
jack or he's trapping me
and i think a jack is not really going
to fault unless the river brings
something scary but if something scary
comes in i also make a hand maybe on the
ace i would have bluffed
but that i guess is basically the only
card
defend the 910
[Music]
go for a check call
the turn i think i'm gonna go for a lead
it's not necessarily that
we have an advantage on the queen
here i think this one is quite close spr
is not that
big i'm going to make a tight fold here
so i'm leading turn here not necessarily
because the queen is a better card for
me
i don't think that's actually the case
um
because i'm gonna check race let's say i
had ace queen of king queen
i would check where is that a high
percentage of the time he still and he
will always have them as well
but after i check out basically if he's
going to see that a lot i'm going to
fold all of my air and when i call
i kind of have a made hand region where
he steals a lot of air
so on the turn i think for example he
can have a hand like
jack 7 that i would just check fold on
with on the flop
so my range is more made hand heavy
and he has more air and usually when
there's a spot where villain has a lot
of air
um
you want to be doing a lot of small
betting
and in this case that's dunking but for
example the reason why we see that a lot
in position
is also basically based on the fact
that yeah villain has quite a lot of air
we have an advantage so that's why we
see that a lot for one third sizing
it's a think i'm calling versus a meme
[Music]
race
[Music]
and i'll be leading this flop i think
this flop is quite favorable for me
from the small blind if you look at what
i'm gonna call
jack 6 off i probably have to go against
a 2.4
like alien
[Music]
checks i think we're going to approach
this board a bit more on the polarized
side so
not going to be betting jack six here
open threes which is a bit
loose but there's a weaker player on the
bottom
go check he goes for a half pot delay on
a card that's definitely way more
favorable for me
since he's opening 2.4 i'll have way
more forex offsuit in my range
goofing jack 6 is easy call
[Music]
if he checks i find it very unlikely
that we're beat
i'm gonna make a very big bet here don't
think he has a king i think
jack axis is most likely holding
and i think we can actually fold them
off a chop here
[Music]
so basically if you if if the most
likely hand that he has when he
bets turn and then checks river is a
jack without a kicker so i'm not ace
jack i think ace jack is probably strong
enough to value by himself again
because you don't really want to check
and me checking back jacks
i didn't check back jack x i better tune
off that spot
but in general i don't think people will
expect me to do that
so then i think we sort of have a free
will situation whereas if he has a jack
often enough yeah
and basically he can fold the chop
so i like that play
the recreational opens three x he has
30 big blinds this guy is definitely on
the looser crazy side
um there's no one behind me which means
i don't really have to
think in a balanced way versus a
recreational so i'm going to go for
an exploitative 3-bet sizing of 15.
this way we will have
a bit less than pot left
and we can basically get it in on any
type of flop
now the question is how do we want to
get it in
and i think in this case our hand is not
strong enough to value that so our value
should come from
letting him bluff something so let's
hope he didn't hit
he didn't he had a worse hand
[Music]
very important to uh
when you've already decided that you're
getting the money in
then your objective is to try to find a
way that getting the money in has
highest ev
here it's quite close i think checking
is a bit better
when the king hits i don't think we can
value better ace high
um if this was
a nine or lower or something i would
definitely value that in a limp pod
[Music]
and i think on the river we have quite a
clear check call i mean he's wrapping a
king
[Music]
right he could definitely have i mean
it's a limb pot so you can have
basically anything
[Music]
i think actually this is gonna be a good
time to call it a part one
[Music]
if you like this video then give it a
thumbs up
to me while here we have pocket threes
[Music]
and king five
it's important to not play your low pass
too passive all the time
so i like my step there and with the
king five
checked it down basically nothing
happened so i think we can probably
squeeze out a small bet
but yeah i think this is a good time to
to wrap up the first part of the video
make sure to check out the second part
of the video which will be released
good question actually that's
information i currently don't don't have
but a bit later after this video i guess
[Music]
make sure to subscribe and turn
notifications on when the part 2 does
release
you are the first to know if you have
any questions about hands that were
played or
about me or about poker ambition
please leave them in the comments down
below
and we will get back to you guys looking
forward to see you in part two i'm sure
i'm gonna try my best that a lot of
interesting spots will come up
so see you then
[Music]
