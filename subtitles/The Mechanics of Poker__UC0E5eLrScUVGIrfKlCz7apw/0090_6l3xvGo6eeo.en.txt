[00:00]
good card
i was counting obviously he sometimes
makes kings
but he can now have also made king queen
or ace king ace king is more
combinations than
an ace king so therefore i think it's a
good card
and the ace is an interesting card as

[00:15]
and the ace is an interesting card as
well i think if he's gonna
go in with cooler gym
yeah it's gonna be cooler
yep
[Music]

[00:30]

[01:01]
academy what's up guys
what happened to the music
or there was a change in song i was like
did i leave you guys without any music
no right
so
let me see poker
rules of the game how does it work i

[01:15]
rules of the game how does it work i
haven't played poker in two weeks
also not prepared i do have a little
document
which
i call three keys
for winning poker it's open
but you guys don't see it because i
don't have that screen selected

[01:31]
don't have that screen selected
but basically i think i can
can i share yeah i can share some titles
okay
and then i have more explanation for
myself with like a reminder how poker
works i like to go over it before i
start playing the first uh

[01:47]
start playing the first uh
thing that's very important poker is
hand reading handwritten skills yes yes
yes it's the skill to figure out what
your opponent has
based on who he is and his action taken
okay
that's a reminder to myself and then i

[02:01]
that's a reminder to myself and then i
have some sub points
um
which basically evolve around point two
i see which is avoid what stronger
striker what's weak a little sun zoo
philosophy here or
the people who followed

[02:15]
the people who followed
who were participating in the free
webinar i talked about phil hellmuth how
how we dutch bullets so this is you know
a little bit of white magic that i'm
trying to implement in my sessions and
then i have a long story continuing at
that point as well
um

[02:31]
um
then i have a couple of things that in
general
a bit more
go a bit more in depth in what i
consider to be strong what i consider to
be weak and how i try to
maneuver my strategies around that
some default responses in certain

[02:46]
some default responses in certain
situations
let me see if the bed box works
percentage of pot
50. yeah it works again perfect
this and actually i'm gonna start
checking that's what i'm gonna do

[03:03]
i'll check again [ __ ] it why not
we're in trippy mood we're in the trappy
move

[03:16]
not anymore
okay so it was just what it seemed like
pocket five or something seventh okay

[03:33]
pocket five or something seventh okay
i guess from a range perspective call is
fine from uh
people usually have pocket sevens there
it's obviously better to race
or maybe i don't know

[03:45]
or maybe i don't know
lee turned small
elite river small i meant as we open up
the seven deuce cause we don't give any
[ __ ] guys guys show them drunken style
and i think it's good for poker like
bring some fun enjoyment

[04:02]
let's over bet his ass
lego lego
i need false
that's how we do it guys okay through

[04:16]
that's how we do it guys okay through
whatever it is for suited
we get a cold call from mr kibion from
croatia i'm not really sure where he is
but
say this is a 10 percent board

[04:31]
is it or is it a cold car range
can actually also just be a range
checker
i'll go for a range check
oh wait it's three-way
pay attention

[04:47]
pay attention
to where i would have wanted to bet
good luck wicko hmm
thank you for the reminder mr gameplay
on the hmm

[05:00]
on the hmm
it's a good it's good river guys it's a
good river
over 25 again
a snap called
queen aisu

[05:15]
i also had an ace i thought that was
very unlikely
you know since we have an ace you know
it's uh that's not likely that he
has an ace

[05:36]
this sucks this sucks this sucks
i'm going to make a knitty folder

[05:47]
i'm going to make a knitty folder
there's a zeus played with zeus before
thinking against him i cannot fault yet
jax also has some improvability like
ominate

[06:06]
and since i have him as like a semi
recreational but knows how to play cards
a little bit but from what i remember a
little bit nittier

[06:15]
little bit nittier
i don't think i can fold just yet
same now
as i think my outs are probably all life
his main bluffs did improve though like
eight or something

[06:37]
so yeah the turn is just a pull outs
maybe some implied dots

[06:47]
i did think that batting flop was kind
of the best of all
options we flopping trips
after introducing the flat goal the next
tip i want to tell you about is what i
consider to be my strongest weapon in no

[07:00]
consider to be my strongest weapon in no
limit taxes hold it's called the flat
call
so i basically will flat call with just
about anything before the flop
so my boy raises pre-flop i see two
kings
i flat call
for the next time when my boy raises up

[07:15]
for the next time when my boy raises up
pre-flop
i look down i've got the 6'4 off suit
i want to call then too
i'll flat call and it's gonna be the
same regardless all right gavin sorry to
stop you right there you see that i
raise the flub

[07:36]
i call
the flat go the flat go continuous so we
decide to flat go and we raise the flop
no it really raises and we flat call and

[07:46]
no it really raises and we flat call and
now it's up to him to figure out if this
time is the wacko calling with a draw
with a pair or with an eight
this is one of these spots where you
just close your eyes as a matter of fact
i'll

[08:00]
i'll
put my hand
above the screen i didn't see the river
but i'm just gonna call
let me see
and expect to
win i don't think there's any river that
i'll fold is there anywhere i will vote

[08:15]
i'll fold is there anywhere i will vote
let me let me think about this
i don't think so
he checks oh now i
probably jam is there a river so do we
need to see your cards in german never
that wouldn't gem

[08:32]
i don't think so i'll just jam
no snap call
but then we probably have the best hand
whatever the river is

[08:47]
he's thinking about it so that's good
huh
he falls what's the river and five of
spades do you need some help playing
three bad pots out of position well for
that we have created our master classes
in which we dedicate one coaching

[09:01]
in which we dedicate one coaching
program to dive very deep into a
specific spot go over to the site
pokermission.com masterclasses and
eliminate those weaknesses and i gotta
call the seventh and flop a set
i'll explain you guys how to do that the
last tip i have for you is on small

[09:16]
last tip i have for you is on small
pocket pairs
and these are hands that you can win
monster pots
so when you get delta pocket pair try to
flop a set
play it smooth and win all the money
okay this is not a set but uh

[09:31]
okay this is not a set but uh
i'm gonna
[Music]
go
and he's checked back here

[10:01]
hey
eats with this spade probably calls some
of the time
not sure i think so five four suited
obviously gonna be in there i rolled low
so we're gonna go for the flat goal

[10:15]
so we're gonna go for the flat goal
give tax here a little bit of the
the gavin flat call strategy
let's see uh let's see what dexter makes
of that
when i use the flat call

[10:35]
he goes for the c-vet
i'm gonna go for the race
no longer flat calling

[10:49]
any false ha
feel the power
you feel my power baby
feel my power

[11:00]
feel my power
come on on your bike
on your bike wow i saw i saw pictures of
tony g man
i don't know which diet that guy
followed but it worked

[11:18]
here we're gonna miss a triple let's try
a little format this time
their fault
i knew it

[11:31]
i knew it guys
sure pisses me off though god dammit i
always i'm convinced the bastards are
pushing me around i'm just convinced
that the son of a [ __ ] is pushing me
around i'm gonna go for a little better
on this flop

[11:45]
on this flop
and there's not much villain can do
huh then he raises

[12:01]
interesting turn definitely a turn that
we can draw a little donkey donkey
donkey
that's what we'll do
any fools

[12:15]
you [ __ ] dunk you do it again i
remember in a video before i've told you
to not dunk why do you do that why do
you do that so dumb

[12:34]
at poker mission do you think cass can
play as a superior
pure bloods yes we're pure bloods
are superior more complete poker players

[12:45]
are superior more complete poker players
in general compared to tournament dunks
this guy seems to have already is it
being made up i definitely think in
terms of what you say complete no
obviously tournament players are more
complete poker players than cash game
players

[13:03]
because like we really specialize in one
sword obviously you know you can play
shorter stack poker player you can play
with shorter stacks for example but

[13:15]
with shorter stacks for example but
yeah i definitely don't think we are
more complete focus there better my
favorite hand guys fight for suit for
the people who didn't know yes it's my
favorite hand
we face a four by there with pocket aces

[13:31]
we face a four by there with pocket aces
where's mr triple who's trying to take
revenge for the four by bluff that i
made in against him with king eight he's
also convinced that these bastards are
pushing him around
and we introduce a little cold call put
on our feel homewood face and
play out the hand

[13:46]
play out the hand
oh actually i wanted to leave the 10 20
but that's no longer necessary yes
oh perfect
this is dream scenario now i don't have
to leave that table
it draws a little 14 that's quite small

[14:00]
it draws a little 14 that's quite small
obviously we're still calling
king is a
good card
i was counting obviously he sometimes

[14:16]
i was counting obviously he sometimes
makes kings
but he can now have also made king queen
or ace king ace king is more
combinations than
an ace king so therefore i think it's a
good card
and the ace is an interesting card as
well

[14:41]
i think it is gonna
go in with cooler gym

[14:48]
yeah it's gonna be cooler
yep
that is indeed what they call a cooler

[15:01]
that is indeed what they call a cooler
bro
that's what they call a cooler
but he did indeed thought these basses
are pushing me around
so i'm gonna go for the little four bet

[15:15]
oh my god [ __ ] god damn [ __ ]
sucker
you know i try to i try to put a move
trying to
induce him to get frisky
they just didn't do it
and then the goddamn card comes they

[15:30]
and then the goddamn card comes they
always come every god every time the
[ __ ] goddamn flesh card comes every
goddamn time with the a screen suited
i'm probably calling it off so good luck
so ace king we're all in
what the [ __ ] let's gamble baby girl

[15:45]
what the [ __ ] let's gamble baby girl
here we go baby girl
here we go okay
come on [ __ ]
you had
jax oh my god
