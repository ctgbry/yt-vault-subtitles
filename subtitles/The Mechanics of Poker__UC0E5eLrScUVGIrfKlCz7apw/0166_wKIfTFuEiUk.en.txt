have a chat with Brazilian high stakes
online cash game player Mateos Pinero
AKA exploitable online Mateus started
out his online poker Journey back in

[01:31]
out his online poker Journey back in
2012 with a 50 free promotion and worked
his way up to 40 KML okay the recent
Milestone of his where he joined the
likes of Stefan Linus Mike boyfriend so

[01:45]
likes of Stefan Linus Mike boyfriend so
started out with zero all the way up to
40 KML as always this way this grind
towards the top did not come without the
necessary bumps in the road having to
move down and stake drastically and even
considered stopping completely very

[02:01]
considered stopping completely very
curious to dive into how he has overcome
these obstacles that I'm sure some of
our listeners find themselves in so
hopefully Mateos can share some valuable
Insight in how to overcome the struggles
poker players face as always we are
joined by my co-host co-mechanics of

[02:17]
joined by my co-host co-mechanics of
Poker coach Adam Adam what are you
personally curious for with our guest
today
yeah I'm really looking forward to
diving into this five-year period where
he really struggled to get things

[02:30]
he really struggled to get things
working he had some success where he
went from 25 an hour to one cares then
hit a lot of turmoil and a lot of
self-doubt about his poor career was it
gonna work out so uh I actually think
these periods of players career the most
interesting it's generally where they
shape their mindset they're kind of uh

[02:45]
shape their mindset they're kind of uh
viewpoints going forward for the rest of
their careers so I look forward to
digging into that period and seeing how
he came out the other side and went on
to uh to play high sticks after

are a high stakes cash game player from
Brazil uh and today in this conversation

[05:15]
Brazil uh and today in this conversation
I wanted to start actually pre-poker as
many uh other guests as well you as well
have played competitive supports and
video games before you switch to Poker I
want to start off with the sports
section you manage it in your teenage

[05:31]
section you manage it in your teenage
years you were playing handball five to
seven days a week so that's making it
very serious what were some of the
things you learned about being
competitive in sports that you think to
help maybe she shape your mindset for
example in being a professional poker

[05:45]
example in being a professional poker
player probably one of the most
important things that I learned with
competitive sports or like team sports
especially is you gotta put the work
hours and you gotta put your mind on it
in order to work you know jumping ahead

[06:01]
in order to work you know jumping ahead
a bit but we you can go back in the
again in a few minutes but it's like I
see a lot of people in poker uh most of
Brazilians especially because like
they're more near me and I I know how

[06:16]
they're more near me and I I know how
they they think
uh they wanna shortcuts you know people
wanna like Jump Ahead like they want to
for example they join a team uh Sports
uh whatever like uh football team or uh

[06:32]
uh whatever like uh football team or uh
hand voting for example and all they
want to do is play uh the game and score
goals no one wants to uh
how it's called like the to the

[06:47]
how it's called like the to the
defensive work no one uh no one won't do
the hard work like the Dirty Work right
that it's not on the hollow thoughts
when the the uh all its uh when we think

[07:01]
when the the uh all its uh when we think
about it
and
but you gotta like
do the basics I think the the most
important thing is that you gotta learn
the basics you gotta learn it well you
gotta solidify uh strategy like in poker

[07:18]
gotta solidify uh strategy like in poker
you gotta learn how to do it like to how
to pass how to defend how to attack how
to pass the ball how to positioning on
the field on the chord Etc

[07:31]
the field on the chord Etc
and
like the dribble uh how it's called in
the in it's not the it's the dribble I
think it's it is right yeah like the
drip is just um
Cherry to the the cake you know it's not

[07:47]
Cherry to the the cake you know it's not
the the base net that's not what it's
meant to get you there like for example
if you uh uh see vinicius Junior playing
right now uh the guy went to Real Madrid
he was like very fast very strong he was

[08:03]
he was like very fast very strong he was
dribbling a lot but he couldn't manage
to get the right decisions like to take
the right decisions in the right time
for like one year at last at least and

[08:18]
for like one year at last at least and
and when he get there he like in two or
three years yeah I think three years now
right
he now can pass the ball he can perform
well under pressure he can uh make the

[08:32]
well under pressure he can uh make the
right decisions like when to pass when
to find uh finalize when to shoot uh and
that's make the like the dribble is uh
just one side of it is like one small

[08:46]
just one side of it is like one small
portion one small fraction of everything
he already knew in that he uh get better
doing why he was a real one working
every day and Etc so I think the most

[09:02]
every day and Etc so I think the most
important thing is that is this that I
learned we got to know in poker for
example we got to know uh
our strategy where DV is coming from uh

[09:17]
our strategy where DV is coming from uh
what you want to do
like in jumping another again like being
present in the Moment Like if you're
playing any competitive sport if you're

[09:30]
playing any competitive sport if you're
not present there if you're thinking
about something else
people are gonna run you over no matter
what the level their level uh if you're
competitive
people you're just like you've got to be

[09:45]
people you're just like you've got to be
very present to take the best decisions
and make the right decision best actions
Etc
so I think that's the most important
thing because that reminds me a bit of
you you're matching finishes I
personally follow Manchester United a

[10:01]
personally follow Manchester United a
lot there's Anthony I have a kind of
kind of the same the same feelings with
that guy like dribbler dribbler likes to
do tricks but this final decision making
oh my God yeah yeah so horrible the
maturity that you know I think players

[10:17]
maturity that you know I think players
have to go through right they came up
they were good dribblers right and
that's what they did and I completely
for example I play football as well and
usually if you play like a bit more
friendly football game you always have
to say at some point hey guys we have to

[10:30]
to say at some point hey guys we have to
defend as well right
you have to say to people or like you
know let's say for example you make an
overlapping run not to get the ball but
just to create space that's something
that people start doing at a higher
level right and in you know if you play

[10:46]
level right and in you know if you play
a bit more recreationally you you're
there you make that run because you want
to have the ball right it's not I'm
making this run I'm just running here
wasting my energy I don't even want the
ball I'm just drawing like a gap for you
to walk into or something that's
something that's that happens way more

[11:00]
something that's that happens way more
at professional levels so what would be
for example you mentioning you know the
dribble is the chair of the cake what
would be like the dribble if if if in
football we have the dribble or like a
nutmack what's like the nutmeg of uh a
nutmeg of Poker that people are a way to

[11:16]
nutmeg of Poker that people are a way to
wait wait to focus on where you're
saying way more Hey listen you gotta
mature your game you mentioned like
repetition of like maybe the
fundamentals maybe the more boring spots
right how do you then so what what would
be like the nutmeg of Poker and how do
you

[11:31]
you
make repetition fun
I think it's more like the mentality not
one thing specifically like uh I'm an
exploitative player you you've probably
heard that 100 times more than me than

[11:47]
heard that 100 times more than me than
myself so like you were exploiting what
guy what what
you're exploitative okay so what are you
exploiting and then you ask that and
people just like okay glitching The

[12:00]
people just like okay glitching The
Matrix they don't know what they're
saying and they don't know why they're
doing that so uh I think that's it like
the guys trying to exploit but he
doesn't even know what is his exploiting
what what's the basics what it's the

[12:17]
what what's the basics what it's the
equilibrium yeah he's trying to he's
trying to do something genius basically
trying to look for spots to to maybe
hero call Hero full make a great Bluff
that's more the mentality with which he
plays poker which would be you know all
like all the cool things but not really

[12:31]
like all the cool things but not really
where the money is made right you you're
saying like where the money comes from
more like okay playing your good hands
well playing a solid strategy you can
more boring things that you yes preamble
mm-hmm

[12:45]
mm-hmm
for sure
yeah and I I am
in Dota when when I play DotA and I
played that yeah you mentioned you're
also playing Count Strike DOTA right
yeah some computer games you really

[13:01]
yeah some computer games you really
you're playing a lot as well
in these two you you kind of feel in in
football as well you see the drive that
people have to the the
I think like to be famous I don't know

[13:16]
I think like to be famous I don't know
if that's the correct word like they
want to be the Checker they want to be
the striker they want to be the Farmer
they want to be the hard uh
HC I I don't remember how it's called in

[13:31]
HC I I don't remember how it's called in
English but like they want to be the
player that
make beautiful place they they don't
want to be the guy who you don't want to
be the goalkeeper
like okay they want they just want to

[13:46]
like okay they want they just want to
get the the most of it but they wanna do
what they got to do to get where they
want it like I think oh yeah I I get
what you mean especially you know as you
mentioned not something specific it's

[14:00]
mentioned not something specific it's
more your overall mindset towards the
game it seems like you know a bit more
of a Chase of dopamine cool things
but then actually to to come back to to
my question then
how have you throughout your career

[14:16]
how have you throughout your career
um stayed focused on what's actually
important and where the money actually
comes from instead of maybe being
derailed by shiny objects like you know
the dribble the nutmeg which would be
like you know the cool place in poker
I've definitely been guilty of that of

[14:30]
I've definitely been guilty of that of
wasting too much time and thinking
looking basically for cool plays to make
and in the meantime screwing up on a lot
of fundamental spots
[Music]
um I do that until this very day so it's

[14:46]
um I do that until this very day so it's
like I I don't think it's something that
you get rid of for good
so
um
I'm I struggled a lot for a large period
of time like playing because we're we're

[15:02]
of time like playing because we're we're
talking here about Brazil Brazilian
reality like if you're playing 200
it's already a good amount of money that
you're making every day so every day not
every month every year for getting a

[15:18]
every month every year for getting a
good living out of Poker so you can stay
bored uh uh because it's not that uh
dopamine Rush that you said like if

[15:30]
dopamine Rush that you said like if
you're doing that playing 200 for three
two three years it's kind of get it gets
bored and you gonna chase that
different strategy you're gonna chase
different uh sizes you're gonna try to

[15:48]
different uh sizes you're gonna try to
overrun up on it when you shouldn't
you're gonna try to do cool plays like
you said uh check all into uh
Reverb with catching on spot that you
shouldn't Bluff raising River when you

[16:01]
shouldn't Bluff raising River when you
uh and
most important I think is you try to
Chase something else
in poker

[16:15]
in poker
but it's something like you're trying to
chase something in life
through poker yeah sort of the
significance like uh you know I need to
do I need to do something cool to be
significant in this game yeah like oh
okay what you do for a living I play 200

[16:32]
okay what you do for a living I play 200
and once you do that okay I I like I
just play a solid strategy and win rate
back and that's it I play
six to eight o'clock
okay so you you basically have a job

[16:46]
okay so you you basically have a job
like everyone else and then you've gotta
uh make excuses to do stupid stuff on
your game yeah to at least have some uh
yeah to feel like something has happened
through throughout your day yeah quite

[17:02]
through throughout your day yeah quite
lovely so what you know you mentioned
like Brazilian mentality maybe they are
looking for ways uh I think I've we
actually talked about this with I think
it was figure about that he sees a very
big difference in like European

[17:15]
big difference in like European
mentality in poker that they're usually
way more driven by you know ambition
they want to become the best they want
to reach the top they're usually more
willing to take risks and stuff whereas
in Brazil they're maybe a bit more
driven towards around Financial Security
like they see the financial opportunity

[17:31]
like they see the financial opportunity
so as you were also saying like a lot of
better layers maybe in Brazil strive
towards getting to 200 and then they
make good living and that's kind of what
they strive towards what made you
want to strive higher than 200 NL why

[17:45]
want to strive higher than 200 NL why
did you not just stay at tuna tunnel
because you made a comfort living
what is it like that competitive driving
you which I guess was also there in
handball was also there in playing games
because for example you play handball
five to seven days a week you could have

[18:00]
five to seven days a week you could have
also just oh I like to play handball
let's play handball twice a week but no
you you you went all in why
um uh first of all like
I think it uh gal fund said that once

[18:18]
I think it uh gal fund said that once
like a long time ago about being
everything being easy for us like in
school if you have some uh
a bit like is if you and if you are an

[18:32]
a bit like is if you and if you are an
easy learner like everything comes easy
any pork is not in poker it's not like
that
uh and when you get to this barrier like
this wall and you hit this wall when
you're okay like that is challenging so

[18:48]
you're okay like that is challenging so
what what I got to do to get to to the
other side of this wall or to solve this
problem and be easy in life again like
be it's lazy not not lazy but be in a

[19:00]
be it's lazy not not lazy but be in a
good spot again and say okay I I I kind
of like playing poker like I'm good at
poker
um
so it was probably around
the time I joined BTS but

[19:17]
the time I joined BTS but
[Music]
um
because I was playing 100 for three
years
like two or three years and it's very
boring and it's like but why I I'm born
to do that like I I'm here and wasting

[19:32]
to do that like I I'm here and wasting
my days like my yearly my late 20s
playing 100 then grinding these to do
what like that's the that's the ceiling
of what I'm going to do with my
life

[19:46]
life
so I joined the BTS
uh I
learned a lot like the mentality of I
think by the time was baby sick
and Walter they both had the same

[20:03]
and Walter they both had the same
mentality and that like
helped me a lot because it goes from
winning okay it's not just about winning
it's do doing the right things to win

[20:15]
it's do doing the right things to win
so if because if you're playing poker
variances like the main factor one of
the main factors and you can do whatever
and still want like the you can I I if
I'm not wrong let's cheer for the six

[20:31]
I'm not wrong let's cheer for the six
first months of the year uh
the greatest winner on PokerStars were
was a fish like the guy was winning like
1.5

[20:45]
1.5
100 or something
and 150 100 and something and
then the variant hits him and he lose
like 20 on 3K hands so it's not it's not
about winning in the short term it's
like building a mentality building a

[21:02]
like building a mentality building a
strategy building uh an environment
environment that's going to help you to
make the best decisions and then you're
gonna start like all of this suddenly
but no you're gonna start winning yeah

[21:16]
but no you're gonna start winning yeah
exactly you start winning and like but
that that really came later to mean life
because like I I didn't have much money
when I was growing up

[21:30]
when I was growing up
so you kinda in the mentality of
surviving you know like you're gonna
gonna how so you have aggress of it we
were were of the in the point of
choosing which build we are going we're

[21:46]
choosing which build we are going we're
going to pay so how can you build
something in the long term so so yeah
how can you have like that mentality
when your current situation is deciding
which Bill you're going to pay right
exactly like basically

[22:00]
exactly like basically
when making money now is very important
so it's very hard to have like that
long-term Vision right you just need
money because you need you need you need
to decide which bill you want to pay and
preferably YouTube Just Pay both now
straight away
yeah so there's the yeah that's like a

[22:19]
yeah so there's the yeah that's like a
game changer for me it was like it was
the BTS the mentality of these guys like
I joined therapy so we we kind of have

[22:31]
I joined therapy so we we kind of have
to do deal with it and like get like
separate yourself for of this
childhood
of yours

[22:45]
of yours
so and build a new one be with a new
person do the best you can go and
realize your potential
so so you felt like for example you
mentioned therapy you felt like
the maybe your Association that you had

[23:00]
the maybe your Association that you had
the money given the environment you grew
up in was holding you back in terms of
for sure maybe maybe striving striving
for further than 100 ml yeah yeah
so
we kind of you know the timeline region

[23:17]
we kind of you know the timeline region
already jumped up a lot no worries no
worries I'm on top of it we will uh we
will make sure it stays in line okay
so yeah I remember uh the day I I

[23:30]
so yeah I remember uh the day I I
contacted Goose car the Stefan and
he has had a questionnaire about life
what you're doing poker how you think
about poker or what you want to achieve
in poker uh where you see yourself and

[23:45]
in poker uh where you see yourself and
the the future to come etc etc and I
like
fulfill this this application and this
question at this formula and he in the
first minutes of the session he said to

[24:00]
first minutes of the session he said to
me like
okay you're on you're one of the few
that are thinking five years ahead
so maybe we have something here like
let's let's work to to get there because
I said to him like at less than three

[24:16]
I said to him like at less than three
years at least in three years I want to
be playing the games you were playing by
the time I was playing 200 and 500 if
I'm not wrong and I wanted to play like
1K 2K
and in Brazil I think

[24:32]
we had no player playing these games but
back then
I think that
urubu was the only famous guy oh yeah
but like the PLO guy he played like 10K

[24:46]
but like the PLO guy he played like 10K
20K 40K Fine Art wrong but it was Plo
and so I had to kind of open this path
to play 1K and the mentality the what's

[25:02]
to play 1K and the mentality the what's
the hard work the
what we the swings we got to deal with
and
so forth
yeah so so I I wanted to take it back

[25:17]
yeah so so I I wanted to take it back
because as you mentioned you know you
went you went a couple of steps ahead I
want to take it a little bit back to you
know your your playing DOTA contract at
some point you got into touch with poker
uh
you saw did you see poker purely in the

[25:32]
you saw did you see poker purely in the
beginning as like a way to provide to to
get an income like and I think a lot of
the things that you explained if you
have like the what is it is the most
muscle pyramid if I'm not mistaking like

[25:46]
muscle pyramid if I'm not mistaking like
the hierarchy of of needs I think it's
oh yeah yeah oh and like your basic need
is yeah that you know you you want to be
able to pay your bills you want to be
able to eat and as soon as you have that
satisfied you go up in the pyramid you
know and you strive towards like

[26:00]
know and you strive towards like
personal development and stuff like that
but obviously the first need is you know
that that yeah you're fat and you're you
have a certain sense of security so it
sounds like that was that something then
that drove you to try out poker and was
that and also the reason that you stayed

[26:16]
that and also the reason that you stayed
stuck at Honda now you stayed too stuck
in the pyramid and you felt that
resistance of like oh no I want to get
more out of life this is now the basic
need that is fulfilled I can you know I
don't have to decide anymore which Bay
to build I can pay both yeah was that
like the motivation to get into poker

[26:31]
like the motivation to get into poker
and also the reason you state stock
yeah a very good question question I
think you're summarized it like very
well
is by the time I was on College doing

[26:45]
is by the time I was on College doing
social communication and a friend of
mine who was living in New York he came
like he came back for vacation and okay
I have a board uh a card game I think
you guys want to try it out and

[27:00]
you guys want to try it out and
do whatever you want uh let's try it
okay let's try it and like
I'm very very bad in car games like very
bad and I don't like them okay explains

[27:15]
bad and I don't like them okay explains
a lot why you became a professional
poker player
and what was different then in this one
because like here we play play a lot of
turoku and and that's there is not a
very good strategy around it and we have

[27:32]
very good strategy around it and we have
burako I was very bad at both and people
like
kind of mocked me they didn't have the
time or the patient to learn they just
moved that energy to mocking me off

[27:45]
moved that energy to mocking me off
about not being good so I just kind of
created a
a very bad feeling about car games
but this one is was based around
strategy in like in one seat

[28:02]
strategy in like in one seat
you can if the guy sits you in the chair
and okay that's the rules now you're
gonna play okay you you kind of already
start to create some strategies now
obviously that are not good strategies

[28:16]
obviously that are not good strategies
but it's very interesting and
challenging so I started out
and I
found out about bookstrategy.com by the
time

[28:31]
time
and they were giving 50 bucks or
something by for free if you play the
games so I started studying and started
uh
playing and winning like
20 and 20 dollars or so so I was

[28:49]
20 and 20 dollars or so so I was
thinking okay
if I
get good at it
I can
win a lot of money
and like in Brazil you feel How It Go

[29:01]
and like in Brazil you feel How It Go
like if you're a marketing person or
someone that or journalist
you're going to by strive and and
struggle to get the decent paycheck so I

[29:16]
struggle to get the decent paycheck so I
I just moved my my mind my mind from
from okay
now I don't have to struggle to to
anymore to win like a few bucks and if I
do that that's

[29:30]
do that that's
insanely more uh challenging and more
interesting I can do earn a lot of money
so that's what I'm going to do now and I
had that was on the second year of of
the college I guess

[29:45]
the college I guess
so I basically started playing a lot of
workers back then
so it was basically the fact that it had
a strategy aspect compared to like the
other card games that have more of a
strategy aspect that you found
interesting and you thought like hey

[30:01]
interesting and you thought like hey
yeah maybe also with your history with
DOTA and Counter-Strike you learn to
think strategically you're like hey I
can probably get better at these games
because of the strategy X back as back
then in the other games
for sure that was like in the

[30:16]
for sure that was like in the
competitive Factor like it was very very
very uh
helpful for me for me yeah yeah it's
something to prove right that that you
don't suck in card games well
I'm sure they don't say anything now

[30:31]
I'm sure they don't say anything now
anymore right I think you've earned uh
you've earned your stripes you also
mentioned like a lack of I think this
was in terms of uh you were looking at
playing 1K you were mentioning at a
later Pace in your career you mentioned
that there was no

[30:46]
that there was no
no one there you go I quote you you said
there was no Role Models had to open the
path basically because no one has walked
that path when you decided to switch to
playing poker full time did you have a
certain role model that you could at

[31:00]
certain role model that you could at
least follow or were there other
examples of like that you could sort of
follow and they're like hey actually you
can make you're making a good level
maybe fellow Brazilians who are doing
the same
what a few guys uh that were I met in

[31:16]
what a few guys uh that were I met in
forums internet forums
um but that was it and the guys were
just was like
uh drug dealers you know like not drug
deals but societies saw them like yeah

[31:31]
deals but societies saw them like yeah
late poker you play cards for a living
what the [ __ ] and
how much did you lose
you win X but how much did you lose uh
my my uncle lost her house my my uh my

[31:46]
my my uncle lost her house my my uh my
grandpa lost his daughter in poker in a
gambling bat and like whatever
so
I I kept that from people for a while
because it was too much to handle
because uh like okay I play poker but

[32:02]
because uh like okay I play poker but
how you gonna marry someone how are you
gonna tell that to your your like your
wife or are you going to tell that to
your parents wife's wife and

[32:15]
your parents wife's wife and
what your mother is going to think about
it and like I don't know if in Europe it
works like that but in Brazil people
like very okay and how people will react
to that and like

[32:30]
to that and like
okay yeah so if I don't tell they don't
react and we move on so uh you could say
that your environment was not
necessarily that supportive no not zero
zero okay so then everyone was basically
saying don't do it

[32:45]
saying don't do it
but you apparently had the confidence in
yourself maybe also through your
progression and handball to progression
in video games that you were very
confident in yourself like hey I can
make this work or we were also the
results basically giving the feedback of

[33:00]
results basically giving the feedback of
like hey I'm making more money than you
uh
no it was more about uh I can do it
myself like with handball for example in
Brazil everyone plays football when
they're young like for as soon as they

[33:17]
they're young like for as soon as they
start walking you can you can throw ball
and people are like playing but not you
kept on picking up the ball and they
said that's not how it works
no no the fact was in when young in in

[33:34]
no no the fact was in when young in in
when we are knowing sports starting to
know Sports uh we are who are presented
some sports a lot of guys are were
already good enough at football so I I

[33:46]
already good enough at football so I I
didn't have a place that I was going to
be the Reserve I will so let me find
another game where I can do better and I
have to be the guide of the team so
let's find another Sport and I I didn't

[34:02]
let's find another Sport and I I didn't
start very well in handball
but I find it was like find it funny and
enjoyable to play and people were very
bad at it so okay let's put a time and

[34:15]
bad at it so okay let's put a time and
energy energy on that and
do good
so it was not like I had some easy time
play handball uh in the beginning it was
more like okay people are very good you

[34:32]
more like okay people are very good you
know in other sports so I let's find one
that I'm going to be the good okay so
you then learned basically that you can
improve and you took that mindset into
poker as well and we're like if I put my

[34:45]
poker as well and we're like if I put my
if I poop I know that if I put energy
into things that I will become better
and then I can succeed at that so you
could say that handball helped instill
that confidence in your ability to make
progress in something you put time and
energy into
mm-hmm

[35:00]
mm-hmm
exactly perfect when you when you
started playing out
what were kind of your expectations of
what the poker Pro was like and did you
have any like aims for example was it
that for example okay I want to reach
that Honda now so you know I make good

[35:17]
that Honda now so you know I make good
money for to live a good Brazilian life
no it was more like let's pay the bills
this one this activity can help me pay
the bills and it's very interesting and
it's very challenging so let's put some

[35:32]
it's very challenging so let's put some
energy in there and see where it goes
where it leads me to
that led me to 1K by the time like 2014
I guess and then like I kind of struggle

[35:45]
I guess and then like I kind of struggle
with
goals if I pick some goal I tend to put
it very far beyond and like fire up like
let's let's play 100k
okay because I don't have the pressure
to to get there and anywhere I get in

[36:03]
to to get there and anywhere I get in
the way like I will I I kind of I'm
always improving to get there so I never
reached that goal okay that's uh kinda
not reasonable
but uh on the other hand it helps me to

[36:18]
but uh on the other hand it helps me to
always improve and always think that I'm
not good enough and not better uh
[Music]
still
have had a lot of ways to get better at
this

[36:30]
this
so I I kind of never gets
satisfied with where I'm at right now
oh that makes a lot of sense I mean uh
if your goal is just Oh I wanna I wanna
be able to live a day-to-day life and

[36:46]
be able to live a day-to-day life and
then you reach that then you stop
working whereas if you set away higher
go like I want to beat 100k then
this is actually something that
often happens when people for example
when you bum hunt into a game often the
goal is like okay I want to be able to

[37:01]
goal is like okay I want to be able to
beat the game for example so I can bomb
hunt in a certain game okay but then and
that's kind of where they stop whereas
if they have more mentality okay so I
got into this game how can I take the
maximum out of this recreational player
for example because all Pros they
naturally said okay I'm I'm winning

[37:16]
naturally said okay I'm I'm winning
against the recreational anyway why
would I put more work in it right
whereas if you have the mentality more
of like okay how do I make the maximum
out of it then you start to think
differently right like oh actually where
can I take more money from this
recreational or like oh this guy is very

[37:31]
recreational or like oh this guy is very
bad I'm already better than him and
that's when they kind of stop looking or
to progress whereas okay this this
regular apparently is one of the worst
regulars in my tables how can I take
more money of him even more money
obviously your standard game and because

[37:46]
obviously your standard game and because
you're already better you'll make money
but how can you even make more money
right and that's only something a
question that you're going to ask
yourself if you set very high goals so
in your case playing 100kno so I think
that's uh that's very uh it's very

[38:00]
that's uh that's very uh it's very
beneficial advice for people listening
um Adam I'm curious
like Mateos was mentioning like his
association with money and how he grew
up in a certain financial situation in
your experience maybe personal but also

[38:15]
your experience maybe personal but also
in coaching a lot of your clients uh how
do you see people's association with
money impact their poker career or maybe
certain mental struggles that they run
into
very good question yeah I think it
impacts you a lot especially starting

[38:30]
impacts you a lot especially starting
out if you come from a background of no
money I definitely had no money all my
life it creates like a very limiting
construct of what you think is possible
and you think very survival based so you
like pay bills how to make enough money
for the next few months you don't really
think far enough ahead so you end up
making choices that lead to Shorter

[38:46]
making choices that lead to Shorter
musicians and you can't see what your
full potential is because you're almost
like drowning it's like you're splashed
around the water if someone's pulling
your head in the water all you care
about is getting getting above the water
and then not around him so you need to
almost like get get out of that kind of
survival mindset I think uh Matthias

[39:00]
survival mindset I think uh Matthias
mentioned himself in a bit of a survival
mindset my first year of Poker I was
just like pay the bills how do I pay the
bills how do I not go broke how do I not
get buys I think it if you don't if
you're stuck out too long you can
definitely stop you moving forward so I
think if you come from a limited mindset
the main thing you need to do is get

[39:16]
the main thing you need to do is get
yourself in a financial situation where
you're a little bit more comfortable if
you've got bills to pay like materials
and you can't pay both of them there's
going to be an element of pressure
that's going to be there with that so
yeah I think you can definitely get past
it but yeah when you come from a
background of no money or debt or

[39:30]
background of no money or debt or
poverty you have unique challenges in
your first few years the good thing is
poker then becomes the path to
transcendals to evolve past those
because you can prove to yourself very
quickly through poker ah I don't need to
be limited like matthias's first 20 20
that he made wait a second I can make

[39:45]
that he made wait a second I can make
money if I keep working this game I can
make money from it so I think it
probably becomes a good path for anyone
who is struggling financially then the
hard part is not to get too attached to
the money I know if myself when I had no
money my whole life when I first had 10K
in the bank I was like oh my God 10K in
the bank I'm I'm rich and you get this

[40:01]
the bank I'm I'm rich and you get this
kind of two attached to both sides to
losing and winning money so I think
that's uh yeah when you come from a
background of zero money I think you've
got to work harder to transcend those
things to the point where you get
comfortable and you get to uh yeah play

[40:15]
comfortable and you get to uh yeah play
the game of poker for the fun of it and
to evolve and I really like what Mattia
said I kind of playing like kind of a
long-term game of setting a goal in the
future and almost like the goal sets the
direction and for yourself you've
created like a very long-term vision of
playing 100knl or in reality is being

[40:30]
playing 100knl or in reality is being
the best version of yourself which keeps
you in the game for a long time so
that's a really good goal I think the
survival people like myself starting out
struggle with that because you just you
saw shorter and focus with trying to
make immediate ends
all right awesome I want to transition
into your storyline of Tina Pro so you

[40:47]
into your storyline of Tina Pro so you
mentioned you turned Pro around 2012. so
my first question is can you take us
back to what it was like to turn pro and
what defines being pro what was the main
turn of point that goes now in Pro
I think probably being the main con

[41:02]
I think probably being the main con
and like the only income by then was uh
poker so I was playing for around 12
hours a day I think back then to pay the
bills and to graduate in college in

[41:18]
bills and to graduate in college in
college
um so I think being Pros like Auto a
self-in titulated brew it's more about
uh a choice than everything else no one

[41:32]
uh a choice than everything else no one
is going to sign for your like a
contract now you're a pro okay take your
license here your pro go ahead no it's
more about your your committing you're
commiting yourself to doing that and uh

[41:46]
commiting yourself to doing that and uh
for you you know it's like I'm going to
try to do that because a lot of people
still these days and like back then it
was way way way more easier like people
were
very bad including rags and these days

[42:03]
very bad including rags and these days
we got sofas we got coaches we got teams
uh mental coaches as well we got
podcasts we got a lot of info and uh

[42:18]
podcasts we got a lot of info and uh
like industry industry around it
that's
professional lies the game like you know
and people are still getting okay poker

[42:30]
and people are still getting okay poker
easy money let's try it out and it
doesn't work like that I think that was
the main uh factor that kept me in the
game because I committed truly to what
was what what I was doing

[42:47]
was what what I was doing
um yeah I think that's it
so you said you decided and I like that
term because that's generally what
happens there's no form sign you decide
I'm gonna go pro what changed from that
moment when you decided you were all in
a program what were some of the things

[43:00]
a program what were some of the things
that changed from mindset perspective
but also how you're showing up in your
days I was
not very kind of I I decided to be a pro
but I was not very professional in my
routine my daily routine but putting the

[43:16]
routine my daily routine but putting the
hours and reviewing some hands and get
back getting to other place to know what
they were doing and forums back then
forums were the main

[43:30]
forums were the main
source of information back then I was
probably I went to college
stayed there for two three hours study a
bit about something that I read and I
already knew that I wasn't going to do
in reality but okay I need to go there

[43:47]
in reality but okay I need to go there
in Brazil we joke about it it's like
when you get your graduate like diploma
you it's the out of jail free cards
because you're not putting the sales

[44:00]
because you're not putting the sales
with the other people so okay I had to
don't take that for granted I had to
graduate for Rio so I was dividing my
time with between college and poker but

[44:16]
time with between college and poker but
playing a lot of Poker and deciding that
well okay when once I graduate I want to
full commit and get a coach or get uh
another source of information

[44:31]
another source of information
that pulls me up uh on the lab on the
ladder of the game but that came late
like only in
2017. yeah I guess

[44:45]
2017. yeah I guess
with BTS
yeah so your early yes although it seems
like you weren't overly professional it
seems like you managed to climb the the
rank so to speak very quickly so I think
you might mentioned that you got a 1K is

[45:00]
you might mentioned that you got a 1K is
by 2014 so in the first two years so
talk us through that kind of fast rise
to begin with I know there's some
setbacks after but what was going on
during those initial years when you were
moving upstairs originally
um I think it was more about logic
like if you're kind of good of a good

[45:18]
like if you're kind of good of a good
with logic and myself I have a good time
learning or is I I'm an easy learner if
I visualize visualize

[45:30]
I visualize visualize
what I'm learning like I I kind of put
that in somewhere somewhere here in my
mind and uh it's way easier to access
that information so I I kind of build
logic blocks around the strategies and

[45:45]
logic blocks around the strategies and
back then we do that by on paper and we
have have haven't had Silvers uh to 2015
I guess
and so it was more about
taking logical decisions very frequently

[46:03]
taking logical decisions very frequently
and not being risk-averse like most of
the players because people okay we have
a rag here we are not battling we back
then people already about hunting a lot

[46:17]
then people already about hunting a lot
and I was okay this guy I think his bed
and so I gonna play hands heads up I'm
gonna play
whoever comes and sit here so was more
about learning

[46:30]
about learning
Day by Day on on on the making of the
process
then anything else and risk-averse I
think it's very very important I I
wasn't like I was already winning I was
already paying two proofs two bills both

[46:46]
already paying two proofs two bills both
at the same time so okay well whatever
comes it's good enough
so you've got the bills paid you're
moving up quickly you're now playing one
case you're using good logic to solve
strategy but then it all came crashing
down and you mentioned that you ended up

[47:00]
down and you mentioned that you ended up
back at 25 NL for around a year to talk
us through that kind of fall from
playing Monk Is back to 25s and what
happened during that period
and the period time I
have a lot of family pressure like

[47:15]
have a lot of family pressure like
family problems outside of Poker so I
had to cash out a lot and provide to
some people back then and the thing is I
I think everyone works like that because

[47:30]
I think everyone works like that because
if you you have a problem and you can
visualize the
the end of the problem like not the
solution but oh it's it's gonna end it's
gonna
pass in six months or so

[47:45]
pass in six months or so
okay so you prepare your mind and your
routine in your your daily tasks and
everything to in six months I'm going to
be free again to do whatever I want and
in the terms I want to do

[48:00]
in the terms I want to do
but I have
I didn't see a light in the end of the
tunnel so uh I I was like very when you
said
to
when you put your head out above the

[48:15]
when you put your head out above the
water I I didn't have that like I I
didn't didn't know that because I was
capable of breathing again so uh it was
very very challenging to get playing
because I didn't have the The Urge the

[48:30]
because I didn't have the The Urge the
feeling to play I was feeling very bad
about everything about myself I started
doubting if I could beat the games I had
to like if you if you think okay I had I
achieved something I break to 1K and L

[48:46]
achieved something I break to 1K and L
and now I have a downswing I have family
issues to solve I don't know if I can
get that again and especially I think in
the back of my mind the uh

[49:03]
the the thing it was
I cannot back I can not go back to not
paying bills anymore I cannot go back to
being poor I cannot go back to having
have nothing in her head heaven

[49:18]
have nothing in her head heaven
not like a good future
to like uh I don't know how to phrase it
but
the possibility of a good future

[49:31]
the possibility of a good future
can move anyone to do some stuff to put
work to engage in something but when you
don't have that possibility it's kind of
you you just
you're drowned like in your feelings in

[49:46]
you're drowned like in your feelings in
your emotions in your head in your
problems then you cannot find a solution
you and you cannot uh do like you feel
frustrated and probably depressed

[50:00]
frustrated and probably depressed
so
uh I think that was the problem there
and
[Music]
that led to performing like
probably if you have a game you're
probably performing the game every day

[50:17]
probably performing the game every day
in the game doesn't beat the games like
you you're basically a fish
trying to win some hate back and trying
to grind through your downswing
and so

[50:33]
I lost myself from the question
yes it sounds like during this period
everything piled on top of you at the
same time you've got outside factors for
your finances I think you're married
during this time as well for another
bank

[50:45]
bank
kind of a strain for you and it feels
like a very dark period because you
mentioned like you can't see the lighter
than the tunnel and I do feel like for
usological people who are quite goal
driven we like to know where we're going
this is some direction it needs to be
some just a glimmer just a flicker of a
lights to go towards so you've also

[51:01]
lights to go towards so you've also
mentioned during this time you were
having some anxiety attacks so if you
feel comfortable I would love to know
like how you dealt with these anxiety
attacks what what caused them and what
were some of the things that you had to
work through to uh to overcome some of
those anxiety attacks
uh

[51:16]
uh the main trigger was losing days for
sure like the main trigger because
everything was spiked up like you said
so the losing days I went to bed like
what the [ __ ] why what I'm going to do

[51:30]
what the [ __ ] why what I'm going to do
tomorrow if I lose again and if I can
manage to pay the bills if I can manage
to by the time I was
fiance with my wife well I don't know
how to freeze it but uh

[51:46]
how to freeze it but uh
so
uh aside everything we said I was going
to get married so another pressure
another thing to plan I I didn't know if
I was going to be able to pay my

[52:00]
I was going to be able to pay my
marriage for my marriage so yeah
everything piles up
and then I uh started with therapy and
that was the
the main thing that get me out of the

[52:16]
the main thing that get me out of the
hole because you start start to working
on your problems then you like I think
most of our problems it's more it's
bigger in most dangerous in our heads
then it's in life itself

[52:32]
then it's in life itself
so it's more this perspective and is uh
projection that we have about our future
and about what's happening
more than anything else so when you
start working on that

[52:46]
start working on that
um you've you kind of feel like that
there's
heir to brief that you can put your head
above your water you can see the light
in the end of the tunnel and then that
there when the things start to

[53:03]
there when the things start to
get there
so sounds like the therapy was a real
kind of catalyst moment where it gives
you a bit of a framework to deal with
the issues you'll have in but also gives
you that kind of glimmer of light of
wait a second I can deal with this most

[53:16]
wait a second I can deal with this most
the problems in my mind once I learned
to understand them and get past them the
outside world isn't as scary as I'm
making it and I can move forward so um
in terms of therapy what sort of
approach did you go for what can a
therapy if you know you went down and

[53:30]
therapy if you know you went down and
what were some of the main issues you
have to work through obviously there's a
lot going on your life I can I can tell
at this moment there's a lot of
financial pressure there's a lot of
performance pressure what were some of
the things during the therapy that you
felt like you had to work through
um I think the two main points were this

[53:47]
um I think the two main points were this
this fear fear of getting back to where
I was like this childhoods the this bad
childhood and
um
doing we with one thing at a time like

[54:03]
doing we with one thing at a time like
uh if you try to solve anything
everything at once you just end up doing
nothing and being very uh overwhelmed
so mainly was these two things

[54:17]
so mainly was these two things
and
getting things out because I'm not a
very talkative person I'm not very that
loud person
so

[54:30]
so
talking about the problems kinda takes
them of you like you put them away okay
now they are there I can't deal with him
with them they are not inside me and I
don't know what to do with them like I
dress everything that that's happening

[54:45]
dress everything that that's happening
so it's way easier to deal with and I
think that's where the the main points
and the main
issues that I dealt with
yeah I felt like you're not period you
were quite overwhelmed because you're

[55:00]
were quite overwhelmed because you're
doing too many things at once it sounds
like the therapy one you've dealt with
your fears of maybe going back to your
childhood state of not having enough and
not being not having any resources but
then also dealing with the kind of one
by one nature of your problems because
you mentioned it as well like being
present and which I'll skip back too

[55:15]
present and which I'll skip back too
soon being presents a really important
feature for you to uh perform a good
level both in sports and the poker and
it sounds like the therapy was able to
bring your problems to the surface
enough so you could see them for one but
also you could like kind of line them up
in order trying to run into a million
things you're doing one so a follow-up

[55:30]
things you're doing one so a follow-up
question from that what does it mean for
you to be present like say yo you bring
things back to the present moment you're
not in your heads what does it mean to
you to be to be present
um
I
for me I think it's

[55:45]
for me I think it's
about
feeling
like you have to feel what's happening
it's not okay I have to deal with uh
it's not thinking about everything
anything else it's dealing and feeling
uh what ever it is that's happening in

[56:04]
uh what ever it is that's happening in
the moment for example you take a bad
bit okay
you can get frustrated that's normal but
don't try to not get frustrated don't
try to be anywhere else don't try to

[56:15]
try to be anywhere else don't try to
feel uh happy again that's not the point
like feel frustrated and go on and move
on and okay feel happy with something
and move on like feel what's happening I
I think that's the the most important
thing because when you're feeling you're

[56:31]
thing because when you're feeling you're
not
shrine
you're not trying to do anything else
you're just trying to be you know you
try to be here and that's it I love that
definition Feel the Moment feel a moment
and be in it so I yeah it sounds like

[56:46]
and be in it so I yeah it sounds like
for you like learning to uh be fully
embrasive of your experience of life and
obviously when you're going through uh
tough times the reason people struggle
with this is because they don't want to
feel fear they don't want to feel
frustration they don't want to feel
insecure so they'll do something to
override that to suppress that feeling

[57:01]
override that to suppress that feeling
to distract themselves to not have to
feel those that insecurity but as you've
taught like being present means you feel
all of it you always feel happiness you
feel anything that comes into the moment
and you're with that experience and you
embody it so yeah I think a lot of
growth can happen in that kind of state

[57:15]
growth can happen in that kind of state
and that's a great mindset and a kind of
oh my God overarching mindset approach
life from you want to try and be present
in every moment you're in sometimes you
fail sometimes you end up in our minds
and distracted but the more you can be
present the better generally your life
will go so yeah really resonate with
that one strongly another thing I

[57:30]
that one strongly another thing I
mentioned is like during this time as
well as things were compounding you had
put health habits and very unbalanced
social life so could you walk us through
as things work and a component for you
what were your days looking like how is
it an average day in the life during
that period
oh my God

[57:47]
oh my God
that was that that one stuff
um
I think I was grinding from
11 to 4 or 11 2 3 with very short

[58:05]
11 to 4 or 11 2 3 with very short
breaks between the sessions like
for two or three meals meals
um but basically just playing poker

[58:16]
um but basically just playing poker
getting broke light in your eyes every
day and every night and that's like
sucks a lot
so wait that's 11 A.M to 4 00 am
yeah
I got a six hour session but you're no

[58:32]
I got a six hour session but you're no
no no mentioning
what what is this it's like a [ __ ] 18
hour session or something yeah
and sleeping in like four hours a night
because I I as uh Waco said I'm uh early

[58:49]
because I I as uh Waco said I'm uh early
early riser so I was I I went to bed
like for for around four three or four
am and wake up at six or seven
and that probably [ __ ] up everything a

[59:03]
and that probably [ __ ] up everything a
lot more like it it gets worse for sure
and when I met people on
[Music]
holidays and on weekends

[59:17]
holidays and on weekends
was mostly for drinking because it's
kind of cultural here in the city where
I live because we live in the mountains
so all you do when you go out is

[59:30]
so all you do when you go out is
drink and eat and that's it so it's it's
the the city in Brazil that have the
most
uh
pubs yeah they have the most pubs in
Brazil so that's what you do and so on

[59:47]
Brazil so that's what you do and so on
top of all we said before I still have
the drinking issues
and I didn't realize till 20 well like
four years ago

[1:00:00]
four years ago
that drinking
like nah it's not good like you got to
manage that drinking socially it's okay
it's fine you do whatever you want if
your life you and including other drugs
you your your body your choices you you

[1:00:16]
you your your body your choices you you
do whatever you want but drinking lots
uh first of all for me uh is it's
into best depressing because two days
from uh a night where you drink a lot

[1:00:30]
from uh a night where you drink a lot
you you you're down that's it you you
don't have energy you're kind of uh
feeling bad your body feels bad your
mind is
um very slow your your you don't

[1:00:46]
um very slow your your you don't
remember things very well
so if you add everything you said I
think
um
that was tough because I didn't have the
time to think about what was happening

[1:01:00]
time to think about what was happening
and I didn't have the time to feel what
was happening so it's kind of okay every
day is bad and when I'm not doing it
every day that's bad I'm bringing to
forget that is bad and I feel worse in

[1:01:15]
forget that is bad and I feel worse in
the next morning and then it goes on and
on and well it was very bad but
hopefully a uh it passed and I'm I'm
where I'm at right now yeah so we'll
come to the positives of how you got out
of that but I think it's interesting to

[1:01:30]
of that but I think it's interesting to
like observe this because you're
obviously stuck in the cycle and when
things aren't going back going badly for
yourself often we're under the illusion
that we need to fix things we need to do
more so for you you're like up at 11AM
grinding like 16 hours at your computer
because internally you're like I need to
fix this I got a strong drive to get out

[1:01:47]
fix this I got a strong drive to get out
of your situation you're not being lazy
you're not just sitting on the couch and
just wasting time you're working super
hard but the way you're approaching it
is the inverse of what you should be
like you mentioned like you're
suppressing every feeling you're driving
yourself in a burnout when you're not
playing poker feelings are probably

[1:02:01]
playing poker feelings are probably
coming up see like friends meet those
let's have some drinks let's get rid of
all these insecurities and just no time
to uh feel the moment as you said
there's no time to be present there's no
time to uh actually understand what
direction you're going it's almost like
to use the water analogy again it's
almost like flapping around in the water

[1:02:16]
almost like flapping around in the water
smashing Splash and splashing but you
don't realize you can just stand up
you're in like knee knee
oh all right actually what am I
splashing for in your bigger Direction
it's still difficult you're still gonna
make moves there's still resistance to
the water pushing against you but you
can stop being directional so I'm

[1:02:30]
can stop being directional so I'm
interested to know the therapy sound
like a kind of breakthrough moment for
you so I'm very interested to know what
happened next let's see we've got this
glimmer of lights that things can turn
around how did you start to get yourself
back on track and out of this kind of
downward cycle you were in
everything's very like I said day by day

[1:02:46]
everything's very like I said day by day
so you start seeing things you put them
out you're okay now you're gonna address
and organize and rank them
um on priorities and let's put things
together and move on so so uh first of

[1:03:02]
together and move on so so uh first of
all I think
probably
when the the family issue uh
kind of solved itself I I solved it but
when it dissolved in the air uh

[1:03:19]
when it dissolved in the air uh
the air wasn't thick enough then and I I
was like kind of okay
now let's go let's do what I got to do
and now that I already know how to do it
all I have to do is

[1:03:31]
all I have to do is
[Music]
um
do it like a lot of dudes in one phrase
but that was the thing so
that when I I put my mind on okay let's
get a

[1:03:45]
get a
help from someone who knows more knows
better than me in poker and to Fast
Track and to get where I was at again
so I did that by the time was

[1:04:02]
so I did that by the time was
I was with BTS right like I said and I
talked with my wife that they helped
helped me a lot because when we said
okay let's try it again let's try it one
more time let's give it the last shot to

[1:04:19]
more time let's give it the last shot to
like make kind of dissipate the tension
of when it's gonna happen when it's
gonna start to work out again and like
what now okay so what now now we are

[1:04:32]
what now okay so what now now we are
going to join the secret cfp we are
going to put one one year fully
committed to this thing whatever they
say I'm going to do whatever they do
doing I'm going to do by the time I

[1:04:45]
doing I'm going to do by the time I
tested a lot of uh for example
meditation but it doesn't work that well
for me but
that was and I when I get back to the
gym and then like

[1:05:00]
gym and then like
physical activities is
I think it's the best you can do for
your mental health
no brain epic so if you I had to pick
one thing is
I first don't drink alcohol but second

[1:05:16]
I first don't drink alcohol but second
uh two physical activities whatever you
like whenever you can but don't get okay
this guy they say you I had to do 20
minutes or three 30 minutes no 40
minutes a day of uh hit uh

[1:05:33]
minutes a day of uh hit uh
IIT uh uh no no do whatever you can the
way you can but do it that's the thing
your your body and your other you is
going to uh thank you later

[1:05:48]
going to uh thank you later
so I think that yeah and then the thing
just started uh adding a building and
like I
get to the point that I was I was on the

[1:06:00]
get to the point that I was I was on the
base of the pyramid anymore so when you
get to the middle of it you start to
pick what you get what you like and what
works what the work you have energy and
you have room to try things out and

[1:06:15]
you have room to try things out and
you're not uh
like you don't mind them to fail anymore
because
I think that's something that holds you
back when you don't have that that
energy that time that's uh you know when

[1:06:31]
energy that time that's uh you know when
you're not that high in the scale on the
pyramid
so that's very important in probably
what get me to where I am right now
yeah I find it interesting that it

[1:06:46]
yeah I find it interesting that it
wasn't like one big moment or anything
major that happens you solved if you
like the issues you had the therapy
sessions that had a breakthrough but you
mentioned like one day at a time it was
like forward momentum I think sometimes
we underestimate getting momentum in our
Direct in the right direction whether

[1:07:00]
Direct in the right direction whether
it's going for exercise study sessions
it's putting consistent volume it's
looking after your mindset and your in
your life imbalance in doing that day
after day after day and at first it
feels really insignificant you're still
broke you still have no money bills are
still overdue nothing's working and then
you're like oh you want to rush things

[1:07:15]
you're like oh you want to rush things
again but that forward momentum figure
for yourself it sounded like over time
uh it made a really big impact and I
think you mentioned with your wife you
decided to have a final shot so I want
to touch on that actually a little bit
because you mentioned that you made that
decision together so um I'm guessing you
two have a very strong relationship and

[1:07:30]
two have a very strong relationship and
she's played a big role so uh how has
your wife helped you for this time
because it sounds like a lot of people's
Partners May question them during this
time going what are you doing why don't
you do something else but sounds like
your partner was able to uh support you
during the lowest moment really so how
did she how is nephew

[1:07:46]
did she how is nephew
yeah
if if you think about us both like as
partners
I'm more like the dark side of the ink
and he's the bright side of the is the
young I think it's like that because

[1:08:00]
young I think it's like that because
he's just like okay no it's gonna work
let's do it okay let's have a life Let's
Travel Let's uh know people let's move
abroad he he she she wants to do
everything yellow at once so it helped

[1:08:16]
everything yellow at once so it helped
me to do with her and her feelings but
this kind of people by your side is like
uh I I don't have words for that it's uh
an estimate like it don't it's Priceless

[1:08:31]
an estimate like it don't it's Priceless
because she always sees the bright side
of things and she's always trying to
move forward and do new things and try
things out and reaching to goals that I

[1:08:45]
things out and reaching to goals that I
I said I say to her all the time okay
that's not never going to happen stop
stop thinking like that but she's she
and I I love that love her for not
changing and being this way

[1:09:01]
changing and being this way
so it kind of
um
back to what we said like feels good to
be near it's a person that you you
always uh one

[1:09:15]
always uh one
around you away
if it's our friend or wife whatever but
you want her around it because it she's
always going to cheer you up
and that's very important so like of

[1:09:30]
and that's very important so like of
course that's not not always perfect but
uh
this mentality to kept in this subject
uh helps a lot like help the infinite
yeah I think we all need someone around

[1:09:46]
yeah I think we all need someone around
us to uh seize more for ourselves than
we can see like the robot that pushes us
to get that next level it could be a
friend could be a coach could be a
mentor could be your partner but
somebody like gets you to question like
how far can you go can you push things
further maybe you're a person maybe

[1:10:00]
further maybe you're a person maybe
you're the guy who drives everyone
around you but most of us need someone
around us to uh women in our law plans
to tell us come on keep going we've got
more on the tank we can do more than
what we're doing currently so it sounds
like your wife was like pivot role model
perfect kind of person to be around you
at that time to push you to go further I

[1:10:15]
at that time to push you to go further I
like that you uh you said you made the
decision together for doing your report
career was a joint decision I really
like that the unity of you two guys come
together to uh decide on the path and so
I'm really curious to know what during
this patch what kind of skills and
character traits did you have to develop
all right so we've got a point where

[1:10:30]
all right so we've got a point where
you're almost like breaking down your
playing poker like crazy hours your
life's all out of balance you're trying
to make things where I put things aren't
but then you come to the site and you've
got some momentum going again what's
some skills and character traits that
you developed during that patch that
have set you up for the rest of your
career

[1:10:47]
I think
probably
[Music]
let's think about it for a while
okay I think consistence

[1:11:00]
okay I think consistence
consistency
uh is the most important because
if you
do not put uh consistently the effort
and for example you're a very a person

[1:11:17]
and for example you're a very a person
for getting back to the start of the
podcast uh if you're a good player a
good football player you have a lot of
talent
uh if you don't develop the other skills
needed needed to be a player of the

[1:11:33]
needed needed to be a player of the
sport you're playing
with time passing in people consistently
putting the work and the effort and work
and Etc
on these skills of

[1:11:47]
on these skills of
you know that the the sports need
specifically
they are going to out you like they're
going to be better than you and the
talent is not that important anymore so

[1:12:00]
talent is not that important anymore so
and it's not uh what differentiates you
anymore because if you know how to do a
nut nutmeg but you don't know how to
pass no one wants you in the team okay
go to the bench and wait your time and
uh

[1:12:16]
uh
and I think the consistency is the most
important thing that I learned by the
this time
uh and
what what else
I think consistency yeah is the most

[1:12:31]
I think consistency yeah is the most
important one
I think you're the ones you can work on
right if you consistently work on the
things that you're not developed enough
or good enough you're eventually going
to get better and be good enough at that

[1:12:45]
to get better and be good enough at that
them
yeah I think consistency played out on a
long time frame just the results are
ridiculous like how far you can get when
you compound a little bit a little one
percent extra one percent extra day of
the day and this kind of kind of story
arc that we're on right now this wasn't
quick this was like five years of your

[1:13:00]
quick this was like five years of your
life from like 2012 to 2017 going
through this but being consistent
showing up day of the day and getting
the momentum in your in your favor I
think by this time you're probably
setting goals well actually the
interesting or during this point where
you're starting to get back in like on
the momentum in your favor what were

[1:13:15]
the momentum in your favor what were
some of the new goals that opened up for
you so you've already played one case in
the past or you're trying to get back to
those one case as quick as possible or
did you have some new goals that you
were talking at this stage
uh the goals mainly to get it highs that
I can probably and like no okay in 1K I

[1:13:33]
I can probably and like no okay in 1K I
I know I can do the games are different
for sure because we had back then we
hadn't had uh solvers and in 2017
Silvers was was already very

[1:13:47]
Silvers was was already very
popular
so like okay if I have put the right
work in on the right direction with the
right people who have helping me out

[1:14:01]
right people who have helping me out
where can I get to so let's say let's
try 1K first and that was my first goal
and then I get to 500 and was a bit hard

[1:14:15]
and then I get to 500 and was a bit hard
to get by
but
I just kept going like okay let's when
like everyone say trust the process
let's let's
see wherever it can get to me and

[1:14:33]
see wherever it can get to me and
I get to what
like these days I can say I I'm a
regular at 5K
10K don't runs that much but I think 5K
it's good enough and I'm I'm kind of

[1:14:47]
it's good enough and I'm I'm kind of
proud of getting here and now it's more
about bankroll and the risk risks I want
to take than anything else
and like I'm not going to play

[1:15:00]
and like I'm not going to play
Stefano Linus again because that was
very uh was a very poor decision by me
but
besides that I think
any day I'm I feel like doing it I can

[1:15:16]
any day I'm I feel like doing it I can
do it so I think that that I reached
where I wanted to
yeah I climbed them out and so for you
we had this like 2012 to 2017 quite
turbulent yes quite up quite down and
you mentioned like you weren't very

[1:15:30]
you mentioned like you weren't very
professional during this periods and
then you mentioned like around 2017 you
become fully committed so I want to know
like what was the full commitment change
and how did things progress from that
moment
um

[1:15:46]
changing uh like giving up on some
things I think that's the most like I
okay I'm not going to drink
uh on Sunday for example because when I

[1:16:00]
uh on Sunday for example because when I
drink on Sunday uh
the first three days of the working the
first three working days of the week are
kind of uh whatever
so
giving up of some things like and going

[1:16:16]
giving up of some things like and going
to bed earlier
um
establishing a routine to of studying
and grinding and following it
whatever you can and

[1:16:30]
whatever you can and
uh
what when I say it feels like it's very
it's just a few things but that's it's
just a few things like okay you're gonna
work out you're not going to drink that

[1:16:46]
work out you're not going to drink that
much you're going to study every day
you're going to grind every day as you
said before
and ah okay and that's what was a major
big difference that I wasn't remembering
but now I it get back to me it was

[1:17:02]
but now I it get back to me it was
uh get time of Poker like rest you need
to rest
like rest
that's it because like travel travel for
example is the best way you can rest

[1:17:15]
example is the best way you can rest
your body and your mind and uh do that
because uh I was on the mindset of okay
I have to work every day every time I
can because if I don't don't uh people

[1:17:31]
can because if I don't don't uh people
are going to get better than me people
are gonna to win more money than me I'm
going to lose the edge that I have on
them I'm not going to pay the the two
bills at the same time what the [ __ ] no
so when you rest you like your body

[1:17:46]
so when you rest you like your body
needs to rest we are not much machines
and that's the the beautiful of the game
and of life itself so
yeah
um yeah I think myself like although you
said it seemed like small changes it's a

[1:18:00]
said it seemed like small changes it's a
very big mindset shift and it's almost
like thinking about your whole life in
terms of how do I perform my best what
behaviors am I doing that aren't
contributing to that whether it's
drinking alcohol staying up late uh not
taking time off and you started like
really think about your career
profession and go right what do I need
to be doing to show up as my best self

[1:18:16]
to be doing to show up as my best self
and it's it's so interesting like as you
climb high into the performance kind of
avenues you see the highest performers
are just way better at rest they're way
better at recovery like the the guys who
are grinding and out working people at
the bottom but when you get to the
highest levels they're all good at
recovery because you need to be to

[1:18:31]
recovery because you need to be to
perform at a high level so in terms of
taking breaks imagine traveling anything
else you fit in on a regular basis that
is help with recovery or it helps you to
rest from Pokemon
same with my pets my God I love them and

[1:18:46]
same with my pets my God I love them and
they are the the pony dopamine shots
that I get every day and every time
um and being close to the ones you love
and doing things you enjoy and

[1:19:00]
and doing things you enjoy and
there's like
especially in poker we have a lot of
time and sometimes when you have a lot
of free time feels like you have like
infinite time to spare but you don't

[1:19:15]
infinite time to spare but you don't
so use that time use that flexibility
use that uh
like
I always thought I think I was talking
to George one time like

[1:19:30]
to George one time like
I looked like George for B2B a long time
ago and saying when we get to this
industry and we get to some levels
sometimes we forget that why the reason
we joined it at first you know so okay

[1:19:47]
we joined it at first you know so okay
I'm going to play poker because I can
make make money and I'm the boss of
myself and I like have this whole time I
can work from anywhere in five years
from then you you look at yourself and
you're working nine to five and you

[1:20:03]
you're working nine to five and you
stuck in your home you'll never travel
you'll never spend time with the ones
you like like and you're most like okay
I had to work I had to work more I have
to work more to win more money but win
more money for what like that's a lot I

[1:20:17]
more money for what like that's a lot I
would ask this question for to my
students a lot because they okay I have
to grind uh on especially on ignition uh
late night from 10 to 5 and I asked them

[1:20:33]
late night from 10 to 5 and I asked them
okay and you
who you live with what they think about
it
like because you wake up at noon
and people already living their days and

[1:20:46]
and people already living their days and
when they are free you are just working
again and how how do you balance your
life and how how this money is
compensating for the time you're losing
with the ones you like
and I think that's a question we gotta

[1:21:03]
and I think that's a question we gotta
do every day to ourselves in independent
of what we are working on
uh what projects we have in mind we we
have to ask that all the time I think

[1:21:15]
have to ask that all the time I think
yeah so it's so important to remind
yourself of why you're doing it why are
you working hard why are you training
tournament money that isn't the end goal
the end goal is generally to have a
better life to spend with your loved
ones to do more fun things and we can
get into the Trap of more more always

[1:21:30]
get into the Trap of more more always
trying to make more money always trying
to play higher Stakes I'm forgetting
that wait a second like when do I start
having fun when do I start enjoying my
life when did I create that balance and
yeah we can get very out of sync without
see I think it's a daily question at
least like a monthly question to check
in with yourself and go right am I

[1:21:45]
in with yourself and go right am I
enjoying my life am I doing the things
for the right reasons am I yeah
achieving the kind of things I want in
my life and also enjoying the journey
because I think if you sacrifice too
many today's for tomorrows you end up
almost like alienate yourself from the
fun experience of life and often the
people that you want to be around but

[1:22:00]
people that you want to be around but
yeah reconnecting with that and
realizing wait a second if you could say
you're like five years ago where you are
now you'd be like oh my god wow you're
there you're right there enjoy it stay
for it do what you can with
obviously you still want to work hard
you still want to achieve more things
but I think also smell the roses so to

[1:22:16]
but I think also smell the roses so to
speak as you're on that journey is also
important

with me and Adam and make more progress
in your poker career but for now without

[1:24:15]
in your poker career but for now without
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode
and so I want to ask you Renee how about
yourself when you were Junior Port
career was there any moments where you
decided that you were fully committed so
Mateos talked about 2017 in a year where

[1:24:30]
Mateos talked about 2017 in a year where
a few things clicked and you're right
I'm gonna approach poker more serious
now was there any any kind of Shifting
points for yourself where you went into
kind of full commitment mode
hmm
I guess various various points

[1:24:46]
I guess various various points
um I think for me what I think holded me
back to going to full commitment mode
and think bigger was
I guess fear if you look look deep down
but a bit more on a superficial level it
was just not big Ambitions but I guess

[1:25:01]
was just not big Ambitions but I guess
not big Ambitions were maybe hold back
by fear
so when I was fully committed to become
like one of the best that's when I
started to take more actions that were
in line with trying to become the best
instead of like oh well uh it's exactly
what I just said you're in a game with a

[1:25:16]
what I just said you're in a game with a
recreational you think you're winning
and that's it whereas if you don't set
Higher Goals you're not gonna do extra
work to win more so for me it was really
the big change in terms of really like
committing uh was just having a bigger
goal like trying to you know you don't

[1:25:30]
goal like trying to you know you don't
have to become number one but at least
trying to strive to become the best and
then having that mindset and exactly
then you see what Mateos also said you
start to think about oh should I maybe
sleep more so I can perform better next
day hey that seems like in line with my

[1:25:46]
day hey that seems like in line with my
goals because I'm trying to become the
best oh should I maybe not drink because
when I don't drink I perform better and
you know pokers played with your brain
so awkward bad for your brain so maybe
not drinking is probably GTO right and
then stuff like that oh yeah maybe I

[1:26:01]
then stuff like that oh yeah maybe I
should exercise because I'm sitting all
the time and if you know if your body's
moving hey I notice a few more
concentrated right and you start to
optimize everything around it because
you have a clear goal and then also I
think it's easy
to not get distracted for example if

[1:26:16]
to not get distracted for example if
there you know if your friends are every
time going nights out or something I
would always for example I would join
with my friends to dinner and then
afterwards we would get a drink well I
would get use the sparkling water with
lemon that's my to go drink in weekends

[1:26:30]
lemon that's my to go drink in weekends
you know during the day we drink
non-sparkling and in the weekends we
drink Sparkling okay that's that that
that's rough weekend uh but then like if
if it started to reach 12 o'clock I was
like okay I'm out you know I had my fun
time with my friends important usually

[1:26:45]
time with my friends important usually
whatever happens after 12 usually you
know it declines pretty hard in terms of
the quality of experience it's like it's
gonna be very [ __ ] nine out of ten times
so one out of ten times is going to be
amazing that's kind of the Dilemma of
anything that happens after 12 and

[1:27:00]
anything that happens after 12 and
there's a lot of alcohol involved right
usually the most legendary things will
happen but nine out of ten times it just
it got way worse after 12 right that's
kind of how I experience it so then it's
like for me the decision is quite easy
no uh poker is very important to me I've
done my social life so if people then

[1:27:16]
done my social life so if people then
try to get me out of my schedule or like
it's very clear because what I want is
very clear so I already made the
decision so nothing can distract me
because that's my decision it's already
made so I don't have to think and I
noticed nowadays it's it's a bit more
different because I feel like I'm less

[1:27:30]
different because I feel like I'm less
committed to something so I feel like my
attention gets dragged more to the right
and the left because I don't
at the moment I don't have a clear
answer for myself you know I get easily
distracted oh yeah but this is also
important maybe also you know where you

[1:27:45]
important maybe also you know where you
get older other things also become more
important so I'm less willing to maybe
sacrifice certain things and I haven't
made up my mind what's truly important
now suddenly everything is important so
reflecting on this you know is probably
something I should maybe sit down for
some less and and let's put in different

[1:28:00]
some less and and let's put in different
directions I would say but yeah I've
been listening to uh to a lot of your
conversation there's a lot of good stuff
you mentioned the consistency right
everyone knows consistency is key but
there's
I think the overall theme of what I was

[1:28:15]
I think the overall theme of what I was
listening is just a certain level of
Consciousness you notice presence
because yeah everyone knows that
consistency is key but still people are
inconsistent so you need to have a
certain level of Consciousness and a
certain level of presence to be able to
reflect on why am I inconsistent in

[1:28:30]
reflect on why am I inconsistent in
which errors am I inconsistent and why
is that for example you did a lot of
therapy work I did personally a lot of
therapy work myself as well and what
this does it starts to make you
conscious of certain patterns right
right you have certain coping mechanisms

[1:28:47]
right you have certain coping mechanisms
in your life why you deal with certain
emotions therefore you always showing
this Behavior due to an event that has
happened maybe in your past and once you
become present of those and present with
your emotions as well right when you're
no longer scared for it because you kind

[1:29:01]
no longer scared for it because you kind
of know like okay so this is where it
comes from I don't no longer have to be
scared for it I think this is a big part
as well then you can start to see like
oh I'm inconsistent because you know
there's some thing triggered in me when
this and this happens for example you

[1:29:15]
this and this happens for example you
you mentioned big losing days uh the
trigger trigger anxiety and probably
those that anxiety trigger certain
Behavior right so when you become more
conscious of that you can see okay
because of certain things that happened
in my life I've created sort of coping
mechanisms that has led me to become

[1:29:31]
mechanisms that has led me to become
inconsistent in my poker grind right I
cannot play the same amount of good
volume because of this anxiety and
anxiety is triggered by losses which are
you know a problem because of my
childhood you see kind of the link that
I'm trying to make there and everyone
has like patterns like this and once you

[1:29:46]
has like patterns like this and once you
become more presence of it more
conscious that's when you can start to
create make changes right so you're no
longer a slave of your own installed
programs traumas Etc so I think in this
area uh I don't know how it is in the

[1:30:00]
area uh I don't know how it is in the
rest of the world but in the Netherlands
if you say that you go to therapy that
automatically think there's something
wrong with you I think this is just a
general right when you seek help people
think something is wrong it's a general
mentality I think it's a very flawed
mentality right
um
for example like uh I uh with my wife

[1:30:16]
for example like uh I uh with my wife
okay to be fair
you initiate relationship therapy when
you know the certain things that don't
maybe don't really work out so that's
maybe already like six years ago that we
started that but still up until today on
a very low frequency basis I like to

[1:30:30]
a very low frequency basis I like to
schedule and then we can talk about
certain things right it's not that we
can but I see it way more as a coach
nowadays I think before therapist it's
just like it's it's a coach just like
Adam is a coach just like you know you
do coaches like I do coaching it's like
you're you're Gathering knowledge

[1:30:45]
you're you're Gathering knowledge
therapy because because of the word
therapy people have a certain
Association thinking something's wrong
with you right to be fair there's
something wrong with everyone if you're
willing to look right again it depends
on the level of Consciousness and I
think when you go on the pursuit of

[1:31:00]
think when you go on the pursuit of
Poker right
you become conscious of it just the way
the game is designed I think a lot of
your if you have some issues you know
they get triggered and I think you know
then because you set certain girls and

[1:31:15]
then because you set certain girls and
you see that certain traumas might
limitate you and you know that's that
wall I think you mentioned right that's
in front of where you want to go and the
only way to do this is to break down the
wall so to speak and the therapist can
help you break down the wall so going
through it then becomes the way so uh

[1:31:32]
through it then becomes the way so uh
yeah I think that's uh yeah a lot of
good stuff I wanted to ask you mentioned
the meditation was something that didn't
really work for you
um how did you then cultivate this sense

[1:31:45]
um how did you then cultivate this sense
of presence
and because you mentioned presence a lot
right you're very present with your uh
with your emotions being in the presence
for example you also mentioned
relaxing is very important so you spend
time with your pets and your loved ones
but I'm sure you've experienced a lot of

[1:32:02]
but I'm sure you've experienced a lot of
Poker space experiences I've experienced
it then you do take time off but you're
only physically taking time off because
in your mind about the [ __ ] spew you
made like why the hell did I make that
call in the meantime you know you're
hugging your pet or your loved one but
it's not the same so how how have you

[1:32:16]
it's not the same so how how have you
cultivate that and how do you
uh switch off from poker so you can
actually relax when you spend for
example time with your pets or loved
ones
I think this uh the switch from I'm

[1:32:30]
I think this uh the switch from I'm
playing
um solving problems to okay now I'm
living my life
it's very important because
otherwise you don't take it ahead of
Poker ever and you're just working 24 7

[1:32:46]
Poker ever and you're just working 24 7
in your mind then you're going to be
restless and very tired etc etc
so I kind of
kinda I don't know what what I do I

[1:33:00]
kinda I don't know what what I do I
don't know the mechanism how it works
itself but uh I
go go away of the table I get off the
table uh we are like still thinking
about the game okay I think that about

[1:33:15]
about the game okay I think that about
the place we're making
and then I go
and do something that I like to like eat
something that you like uh or if yeah if

[1:33:30]
something that you like uh or if yeah if
it's in your diet or not I don't know
but it's something that you like or do
something that you like enjoy and what
for me it's
eating and
navigating like Tick Tock for example

[1:33:45]
navigating like Tick Tock for example
and seeing like some
could get on Tick Tock or make a
dealing with my wife and cheating her
and doing whatever that I like

[1:34:00]
and doing whatever that I like
so kind of the brain switches from
uh solving problems or switch from
fighting to being like okay now you're
relaxed you're fine everything's fine
and then I go back to the table and

[1:34:16]
and then I go back to the table and
solve the problems that I was thinking
when I just left
and when I solve then okay I have no
problems today the day is done yeah I
have to have more let's say for example
I played my session
there's certain things that I so I'm

[1:34:32]
there's certain things that I so I'm
definitely less less involved in this
area I need to I need to review certain
things just to to make I'll say we'll
just stay stuck in my mind I already
know and I I try to try to let go but
there's just certain things that I feel
like I have to resolve I've been trying

[1:34:46]
like I have to resolve I've been trying
to make improvements on this right you
mentioned a lot of presence okay
and then this for example this is kind
of a coping mechanism that I figured out
like through therapy oh so there I have
I deal with a certain insecurity because
for example a hand and if I don't review

[1:35:00]
for example a hand and if I don't review
that hand that insecurity stays stays
there oh you see cat lover yeah right
there like the insecurity you know it's
it's that that feeling stays there
and I need to resolve that hand in order
for the insecurity to go away whereas
now I'm also trying to be more like okay

[1:35:15]
now I'm also trying to be more like okay
well you know I feel insecure and that's
okay right that's that's also something
that you mention just to be present with
your emotions instead of I have to
review this hand to take to get rid of
this insecurity that I feel about a
certain hand that I played right it's
something I feel I

[1:35:31]
something I feel I
see a lot of players and people doing
are like okay I know I'm not for example
I'm not good uh in three bad pots I'm
lacking in two bad parts out of position

[1:35:45]
lacking in two bad parts out of position
I don't know how to barrel uh the second
Barrel
what region of the cards are good for me
what are not which are not and they
kind of close the eyes and look the
other way
instead of solving it

[1:36:01]
instead of solving it
you know like okay I'm insecure about
about my game but I don't know I don't
want to know how bad is my game
for real I say that a lot so that's then
maybe I mean Adam you could definitely

[1:36:16]
maybe I mean Adam you could definitely
hop in there I'm sure you have something
interesting to say my first instinct
would be that like
they they could not handle if they see
the truth about how bad they actually
are in that spot
yeah I think the ego trying to avoid

[1:36:30]
yeah I think the ego trying to avoid
confronting its own incomplete self and
sometimes we would rather be right
um or at least think we're right and not
find out the truth and yes generally a
Corbin strategy which is terrible
insecure and they build a construct of
being right they like to be right they
don't like to be questions they don't

[1:36:46]
don't like to be questions they don't
like confronting their limitations so
they'd rather not know it's the kind of
people who says things like I could be
really good at that if I tried I just
didn't try it that it's almost like they
don't quite push themselves because they
don't want to uh to find out what
they're limited so yeah I think the not
facing the truth in those scenarios

[1:37:01]
facing the truth in those scenarios
um yeah there's a character trait there
for sure like what basically what
Mateo's saying you can use this sense of
insecurity as a sign that maybe you're
understudied in a certain area correct
it's more that I think the evolution
from an emotional perspective that I'm

[1:37:16]
from an emotional perspective that I'm
more made is that
if I would now take action on it it's
more because I want to and not because
I'm a slave of the insecure emotions
that force me to have to review the helm
because else I cannot continue all my

[1:37:31]
because else I cannot continue all my
life yeah it's a different it's a
different sort of frame
like you once did something to erase an
emotion okay and now you can be present
with the emotion of insecurity and you
can be okay with it and then still want

[1:37:46]
can be okay with it and then still want
to review the hand but more from uh
you're no longer a slave of your
emotions basically right you're more
conscious of the
action you took based on the emotion
that was present and for me this leads
to a whole not a game of consciousness

[1:38:01]
to a whole not a game of consciousness
of presence and you can really zoom out
and be like you know you kind of see see
yourself as a third person you see
yourself doing Behavior or seriously
feeling in certain ways and once it
starts to make more sense where things
come from and you start to understand it

[1:38:16]
come from and you start to understand it
also you're no longer overwhelmed by the
emotion for example if a certain emotion
comes up for example you were talking
about like anxiety around losing not or
going back to something
most probably when that now comes up
again and you know what it is you're no

[1:38:31]
again and you know what it is you're no
longer afraid of it this was actually a
question that I actually wrote down for
you like
do you still experience to a certain
degree let's say you go on a very big
downswing like more recently do you then
still maybe experience some similar
emotions but because now you know where

[1:38:45]
emotions but because now you know where
it came from and you did the work with
your therapist you're less overwhelmed
by it
uh I I think I can say yes but like like
I said to you a few days ago yeah I was

[1:39:02]
I said to you a few days ago yeah I was
experiencing a downswing on
one 1K or 5K I don't remember but I I
still had the drive to play I like to
play a lot but I didn't know I was

[1:39:15]
play a lot but I didn't know I was
playing uh I didn't know how bad I was
playing so my coping mechanism with okay
I'm down and I'm down I'm kind of
frustrated I know that I'm not playing
my best but I don't know right now what
I can do to change it

[1:39:31]
I can do to change it
but I do feel like I need to still play
still get up out of this hole but uh
still get better like still because when
you're down on a down when you're uh far

[1:39:47]
you're down on a down when you're uh far
from your A game you're basically uh
uh showing your weakness all the time
yeah showing all the time they're there
everyone can see and they're just more

[1:40:00]
everyone can see and they're just more
clear for everyone your mistakes and
your leaks so what I did last month was
like you mocked me about it was okay let
me play uh 50k hands of 200 because if I
lose whatever [ __ ] it but still I can

[1:40:18]
lose whatever [ __ ] it but still I can
use that sample to know where I'm
deviating from my main game my game when
I'm playing C game and work on that
later when I I'm not on the mindset of

[1:40:30]
later when I I'm not on the mindset of
uh of a down so basically you were you
notice that you were playing bad but you
couldn't really grasp how that bad play
looked like so you hopped in the 2009
grind 50k hand so you can then look at
those hands and then take a look at your

[1:40:45]
those hands and then take a look at your
stats and be like okay so if I'm playing
bad this is what I do
exactly that's actually so it's actually
that's actually very smart
yeah and another thing that getting back
to the other question but that I

[1:41:01]
to the other question but that I
remember uh in probably azol did we all
did it sometime or on
a certain period of our career is
labeling Rags with the good ragtable no

[1:41:17]
labeling Rags with the good ragtable no
good reg label
and you do that more when you're in a
when you're not playing well right no
actually I I don't do that anymore I
don't label anything uh anyone good good
rank yeah this is actually funny yeah I

[1:41:32]
rank yeah this is actually funny yeah I
so I used I I used to have a gold Tech
and I would take a lot of people gold
but I noticed I would get intimidated by
that so at some point exactly and I only
give myself the gold Tech and no one
else has a gold Tech it was kind of a
sort of a uh a sort of a mental

[1:41:47]
sort of a uh a sort of a mental
solution but what actually I noticed
like the better you the better you're
playing
the more you become aware of other
people how bad other people are because
you know you're constantly in a game so

[1:42:00]
you know you're constantly in a game so
I I find myself if I'm playing very bad
I suddenly start to change people's tags
that are usually players you know I
don't think they're that great and I
change them to normal normal Rec deck
and then when I'm playing very well
again I'm like did I give this guy a

[1:42:15]
again I'm like did I give this guy a
normal Rec deck he's terrible bad wreck
deck
it sometimes changed
how well I'm playing basically uh that
that's that's a quite quite interesting
but for example are there like some

[1:42:30]
but for example are there like some
some specific things for example I know
for myself
when I become a bit more
I guess I guess there's two things that
I can see I can become very pessimistic
uh and might give up

[1:42:46]
uh and might give up
a bluff because I don't see him folding
basically it's pure emotions it's just
like yeah this is not gonna work and I
might just give up a bluff that was
actually a printing a printing Blogspot
for example and I noticed I go fall into
a bit of a victim sort of mentality I'm

[1:43:02]
a bit of a victim sort of mentality I'm
less capable of making
uh strong faults with very strong hands
because I'm like oh yeah here we go
again you know I have a set the
[ __ ] probably with the flush but
I'm not folding it's like I almost

[1:43:16]
I'm not folding it's like I almost
hmm how would I describe this Ellen help
me out there uh like it's it's almost
like I want the pain I want to see I
want to see the pain like I'm gonna call
because I have a set but I'm 100 sure
you rip the flush whereas if you're in a
not compromise State I guess we could

[1:43:32]
not compromise State I guess we could
call it that way you're just like ah
it's a flush oh thanks man easy thought
and you feel very happy about it but
when I'm in a bad State of Mind
then I noticed like I'm uh I'm snap
calling off and it's like almost like I
want to feel bad

[1:43:45]
want to feel bad
does that make sense
or you can explain us now why you know
for poker plays that can associate with
the story why this makes sense
yeah well you get to feel good about
being right there's a weird feeling that
like even though you're gonna lose but
you like predict that look how bad I'm

[1:44:00]
you like predict that look how bad I'm
gonna run it's the kind of guy who like
gets off on being the guy runs bad I run
bad all the time see look how bad I'm
running it reinforces that narrative and
they get to be almost like
self-righteous in the fact that they're
losing their suffering and it's almost
like yeah it must have pain and almost

[1:44:15]
like yeah it must have pain and almost
like it brings this kind of ego to the
friends and it makes you feel smart
about being right about it and yeah you
take you hold on to that and you don't
care about the money you care about the
the being right and being smart and
often a lot of poker players have a
strong identity about being clever by
being smart you're like yep see look how

[1:44:30]
being smart you're like yep see look how
smart I am he had it he had it again I
give him all of my money but he had it
yeah there's an element of the the ego
running Riot there this is like the
classic Daniel no Grano League that they
used to always have you know and when we
grew up playing poker it was always said
yeah I knew it and he always paid off

[1:44:45]
yeah I knew it and he always paid off
standard in all videos if you look at
YouTube Daniel granu always paid off I
don't know what it does if he still does
that up until today uh is probably
evolved but I think a very important
thing here again is we come back to
present and consciousness

[1:45:00]
present and consciousness
because a lot of players they might
start doing these kind of things but
they don't notice it right the
Improvement is that maybe an early on in
your career you might find out three
months later that you've been playing
tilted for three months right and the
goal is to try to improve that for

[1:45:15]
goal is to try to improve that for
example actually both both scenarios
that we just talked about has played a
session yesterday and to be fair going
in I was already like hmm
I I I'm I have to be careful here
because I already feel like I'm not in a
great state

[1:45:30]
great state
then [ __ ] sunny sun is technically
straight away with ace against so this
is how the session is going to be you
know at least I gave the money you know
so that's that that's not too bad uh and
then I it was actually it was

[1:45:45]
then I it was actually it was
specifically against Sunny seriously we
played eight hands he won all eight
hands and I was like
and then the ninth hand or the A10 I
know it felt like eight tenths maybe it
was six but then the eight hand there
was a clear Bluff spot
before I already stood out some money

[1:46:00]
before I already stood out some money
before that it was the clearest glow
spot and there was just like I gave up
purely because I just was like yeah this
guy he wins every hand against me like
there was no logic whatsoever if you
look at the logical points it was like
the clearest you know how like in a
solver some Blossom just there so your

[1:46:15]
solver some Blossom just there so your
value gets called but there's other
situations where blocks actually make
money this was just clear I know if you
look at the solver I was making you know
one two BB with my bluff it was the
clearest block ever and I gave it up and
immediately when I saw that I was like
hmm this is this I'm tilt or this

[1:46:31]
hmm this is this I'm tilt or this
something went wrong unfortunately I had
to lose another stack where exactly that
victim that it came up where I had like
two pair I knew the guy that flush but
yeah exactly exactly those points now
the difference is I noticed it straight

[1:46:45]
the difference is I noticed it straight
away after one session because I'm very
conscious about the most of them feeling
so you know
and then I can now take from that and
immediately notice after that that boost
of motivation right there were a lot of
things that were still on my to-do list
for studying pump straight away put up

[1:47:01]
for studying pump straight away put up
my session early back to the lab right
so you can also then use the downswing
as as few and motivation and this is I
think the good thing right we talked
about this before like the good thing of
of a downswing I actually had another

[1:47:16]
of a downswing I actually had another
question for you on Mateos because you
at some point mentioned like
ah I'm I'm
here now and you know I don't know I
have to cope with having to decide
between the two bills I have to pay so

[1:47:30]
between the two bills I have to pay so
it's a free rule sort of from here
mentality why why did you have that
and not the mentality of I'm here now I
don't want to lose it right because you
push through to like 1K you said you
started the Bellow everyone it didn't
really matter to you because you know
you already sort of made it right

[1:47:46]
you already sort of made it right
but why were you not afraid to lose it
back because I can imagine a lot of
players they want they will stay stuck
because they're like oh why now I don't
have to choose between the two bills I
don't want to lose this
why yeah why like what what are your

[1:48:03]
why yeah why like what what are your
mentality
I think probably it's probably
burst personality traits because
for example when I when uh I talk to a

[1:48:15]
for example when I when uh I talk to a
lot of people I know that conundrum of
you have two buttons one you win 100K
100 of the time and the one the other
one you win one million but like 50 of
the time and people always play the one

[1:48:32]
the time and people always play the one
million and I always not always played
the 100 and I always play the one
million
because okay whatever I had time like I
have a life to live I have a lot of
things to do why not to like kind of

[1:48:45]
things to do why not to like kind of
gamble the because mathematical the 1
million button is the correct one but
people think okay no I I got to uh

[1:49:00]
people think okay no I I got to uh
like guarantee my wins I got to get for
example it's like a lot of people that
uh operates on the the financial Market
they want to win every time what the
[ __ ] how do you want to win every time

[1:49:16]
[ __ ] how do you want to win every time
it's like impossible the the people and
they all get they always get scammed
with the ones uh uh making Promises of
five percent wearing guarantee every
month and why how do you think someone

[1:49:33]
month and why how do you think someone
is guaranteeing you that because like if
no one else on the planet is doing that
like they would not sell it so in fact
this can also just be your Brazilian
skepticism I know Brazil is very skeptic

[1:49:48]
yeah no through like like my wife for
example she always when someone just
does something nice he's always like um
these guys
like I'm naturally like very trusted oh

[1:50:01]
like I'm naturally like very trusted oh
my God it's very nice and I was like
what's this guy up to
yeah I've got it I think it's more about
my personality
than anything else
all those curious like going through
this period how did your association

[1:50:15]
this period how did your association
with taking risk change
like in terms of how comfortable he was
taking risks in the beginning compared
to after you've experienced it
in the beginning I was taking very high

[1:50:30]
in the beginning I was taking very high
risks my my risk tolerance was very high
uh but once but once I experienced the
the down and these like dark spirit
I was very risk-averse for a long time

[1:50:47]
I was very risk-averse for a long time
probably two or three years I just
wanted to guarantee my
I don't know 40 buyings a month of 100
NL 200 Nails something like that

[1:51:02]
NL 200 Nails something like that
and but then the mentality of okay that
my life is going to be dead for the next
10 years you know I'm I'm not satisfied
with that and then I was back to my
risk-averse version

[1:51:17]
risk-averse version
and therapy helped a lot because it
a lot of the time there are a big period
of time was about okay now that you get
there where you're at

[1:51:30]
there where you're at
you gotta go for more like don't get
don't get stuck in the feeling of
not getting back to where you're at like
go ahead go for more uh what you have

[1:51:46]
go ahead go for more uh what you have
nothing for example
the reality is nothing is guaranteed
even if you have money in your bank the
bank can go bankrupt and you lose
everything and okay that's a like
fictional numbers that are on a bank

[1:52:01]
fictional numbers that are on a bank
account that you can check but it
doesn't it exists what is this was
exists is like your health uh your
day-to-day
your uh concepts of good and bad what

[1:52:17]
your uh concepts of good and bad what
you like you what you don't like that
what exists the other things you can go
behind and go go after if you want it
and you have time and energy and have to
to go for them I think that the my

[1:52:32]
to go for them I think that the my
mindset right now
hmm
yeah no that may that that actually
makes a lot of sense actually I was
thinking also about the buttons
situation about 100K and one minute so I
guess it's not

[1:52:46]
guess it's not
let's say for example you already have a
comfortable life the decision should be
very easy right but let's say you live
in the street
no of course you get probably the 100K
is not 100 yeah right because like the

[1:53:01]
is not 100 yeah right because like the
consequence of not of losing the flip
are too big whereas if you if you
already have a comfortable life and
basically 100K more or less it's not
gonna change much
right then probably a million could make
a change so I guess it gets to correct

[1:53:17]
a change so I guess it gets to correct
this also kind of depends on uh yeah it
depends on yeah no for sure like yeah
yeah your context where are you where
you at your life and having room to make
a mistake I think that's very important

[1:53:32]
a mistake I think that's very important
yeah because when you if you you don't
have that you're living on the streets
you you don't have room to make it Bank
room management right there yeah yeah
yeah the risk of yeah uh

[1:53:45]
yeah the risk of yeah uh
going back to um basically your rice
because you're playing Hunter now and
then four years later you know we are
here where we are today you're playing
uh playing some of the highest online
games that are available
you already mentioned I think throughout

[1:54:01]
you already mentioned I think throughout
a couple times you joined uh BTS Bluff
the spot shout out to Mrs sherdock
um
I was curious they probably had a very
big impact you already mentioned in
terms of your mentality from a technical
perspective what were like some of the

[1:54:16]
perspective what were like some of the
AHA moments or breakthroughs that you
had that really
helped you evolve your game
there or yeah there so let's let's start
there because I'm also in general you

[1:54:30]
there because I'm also in general you
you've been seeking coaches so that we
can get into that later
um
like I I don't believe much in aha

[1:54:45]
like I I don't believe much in aha
moments I think everything like maybe
something you learned or three years ago
just clicks now then when you learn
something new that connects with that
knowledge something even clicked for you
then
was uh yeah maybe also something like

[1:55:03]
was uh yeah maybe also something like
you you maybe thought about but were
maybe so insecure about and you needed
for example that confirmation of that
coach and therefore you could really you
could really grasp it click it
uh
that's possible to make it

[1:55:16]
that's possible to make it
like a lot of guys joined playing an l50
or 100 and ended up on 1K
so that shifts the mentality because
okay it's possible to in one year time

[1:55:31]
okay it's possible to in one year time
frame to get as high as that as did as
this
and
um
I think probably
I don't know okay I remember one lesson

[1:55:47]
I don't know okay I remember one lesson
from from Walter
that he was saying like
okay this frequency or this size or this
[ __ ] here in the server it doesn't

[1:56:00]
[ __ ] here in the server it doesn't
matter in reality
like these are numbers and this is just
going to play uh are going just to give
you the output of this calculation that
you're putting in the silver but in

[1:56:15]
you're putting in the silver but in
reality is something very different
so if you react it's different you your
job is like to seek out and find how
different is that
and what you're going to do about it
I think yeah I think something like that

[1:56:32]
I think yeah I think something like that
I heard a mix of Charlie Carroll and Mr
sherdock Charlie Carroll said what's
your opponent's range of what you're
gonna do about it
so that's kind of how how you how you
end it but hey you know we can get shout
outs here but that's that's very true

[1:56:46]
outs here but that's that's very true
how did your experience let's say you
had that lesson and afterwards you went
to the tables how did your experience of
playing poker changed
like there was a certain message shift
and I was like oh wow so actually what
I'm supposed to do is kind of dependent

[1:57:00]
I'm supposed to do is kind of dependent
on the inputs right that's kind of the
main lesson I guess right there's
certain outputs they they show you here
but yeah in reality the range might be
different the way he reacts might be
yeah it feels lighter like to play
because you you don't have the pressure

[1:57:16]
because you you don't have the pressure
to click the right button for example ah
yeah because the right button there is
no right button there is a right button
but there yeah yeah yeah I guess what
you mean I hope the listing is also get
what you mean

[1:57:31]
what you mean
uh so it feels free like you you feel
free to play okay I guess it's you're
also being I think your intuition is
probably free I think that might
describe that feeling because you're

[1:57:45]
describe that feeling because you're
trying to intellectually put all these
solver outputs in your brain right
you're trying to memorize everything
it's very hard but intuitively you might
feel like yeah but the correct play here
is different because I've seen the
situation already I don't know how many
times and intuitively I feel like the
range is different so maybe when he said

[1:58:00]
range is different so maybe when he said
that
what actually happened was
it gave room for your intuition to say
ah Mateos finally
you know you can you find it I'm free
trust me I've been trying to tell you
that [ __ ] the range that you're
facing here is not the range in the

[1:58:15]
facing here is not the range in the
solver
yeah yeah you're not you're not anymore
committed to a solver you're not like
slave to the machine like okay you learn
from the machine and now you go there
and grab your money or lose it but it's

[1:58:32]
and grab your money or lose it but it's
a it's it's into you like it's up to you
it's not like anywhere any thing else
responsibility responsibility
responsible I don't know
but like it's up to you and

[1:58:48]
but like it's up to you and
the choice is yours don't the uh
don't give the like the skills to okay
the silver did that I have to do yeah

[1:59:01]
the silver did that I have to do yeah
you just have to try to make the right
decision that you're right for you at
that moment whereas it's it's different
than oh I'm trying to I'm trying to make
the right decision based on soft but I
don't remember that's a certain pressure

[1:59:15]
don't remember that's a certain pressure
you know whereas if you just like okay
I'm gonna try to make the best decision
here possible
then by definition you will sort of
succeed and it will relieve a certain
amount of pressure
and and somehow you're not afraid of
losing anymore yeah and then suddenly

[1:59:30]
losing anymore yeah and then suddenly
surprise surprise you were actually when
the pressure is gone you actually start
to think and actually make quite good
decisions
you also mentioned what's this then also
I guess you were already working with
solvers
or did they introduce you more to like

[1:59:45]
or did they introduce you more to like
work efficiently with solvers yeah they
introduced me to a work of solvers how
was that the transition for your game
like pre-solver post solver ah first
first we we all get like

[2:00:01]
first we we all get like
to attach to I get to
put the writing puts like here I play 33
percent to 22 percent or 75 what's the

[2:00:16]
percent to 22 percent or 75 what's the
the best size possible what's how many
sides I use in every street and then you
get like
uh forward in time and get this lesson
from Walter and okay I can put uh just

[2:00:31]
from Walter and okay I can put uh just
one size here it doesn't matter if it's
33 30 31 28 25
Etc what I get to think is
how my range wants to

[2:00:46]
to like how is my range articulate with
this best bet size
and what this uh gives me and what these
uh leads to on the next street

[2:01:01]
uh leads to on the next street
in like on the net next based on the
size on the person on the ETC uh we get
to the river and on the river we get uh
to make decisions that are kind of more
like black and white but still there is

[2:01:16]
like black and white but still there is
like Freeland everyone is correct you
know nothing's wrong but like some
things are right and some are some are
wrong but you get the point Yeah Yeah so
basically you know if you want if you
want to make a range bet you should

[2:01:30]
want to make a range bet you should
probably not better 200 pot that's
probably another yeah those things don't
really align right if you're gonna bet
25 pods don't bet 20 percent of the time
most likely in most scenarios like the
bed sizing and frequency they have to
you know they have to match but then

[2:01:46]
you know they have to match but then
within that you can do basically
whatever you want right it's in the end
it's always the execution of your
strategy is going to Derma in the EV not
the actual exactly it's a there I can
definitely see how that would be uh
pretty eye-opening usually actually when

[2:02:02]
pretty eye-opening usually actually when
I see uh a Brazilian screen name uh
popping up in the internet I know that's
probably some MDA Redline machine you
are definitely more nuanced so you've
never really dived into the ndna MDA

[2:02:16]
never really dived into the ndna MDA
stuff that was not your school it's more
solid-based yeah a zero zero zero MDA I
I don't I know one thing or two or about
MDA but that's it because I think if you

[2:02:30]
MDA but that's it because I think if you
it's more about this getting this
ability to
execute My Free Will of doing whatever I
want and not what uh
blueprint is telling me to do than
anything else you know like I I got to

[2:02:47]
anything else you know like I I got to
be able to deal with the problems that
the the game is giving me right away
yeah so so basically what you're saying
is what you experience with the solver
if it's too fixed and let's say for
example you get a blueprint MDA driven

[2:03:01]
example you get a blueprint MDA driven
strategy you're again being you're
you're being restricted you're
restricted to think
I guess exactly exactly right and I
think you know both have their benefits
but indeed a common mistake that I see

[2:03:15]
but indeed a common mistake that I see
when people start to use solvers they
stop thinking and think I mean thinking
is pretty important it's nice right
enjoy it it happens yeah I'm sure I mean
I I have the same maybe you can relate
but sometimes when I do too much solver

[2:03:30]
but sometimes when I do too much solver
work I can also fall into like
sort of
trying to memorize what was the correct
output sort of uh for identity like tick
tick I have to take myself a couple
times in the head like what are you
doing idiot uh you know but it's it's

[2:03:45]
doing idiot uh you know but it's it's
contagious in a way if you're too if you
do too much solver work sometimes and
wrong maybe with from a wrong
perspective that can definitely happen
I'm curious like so you're moving up
through the game think how long did you
stay with the bluff spot

[2:04:01]
stay with the bluff spot
one year one year okay so you learned a
lot after that you you you continue on
your own but throughout that you
constantly kept on looking for coaches
because you mentioned you reached out to
Goose core I know recently also you you

[2:04:15]
Goose core I know recently also you you
did some coaching with Dot and always
when I talked to you like oh does he
give coaching as well cool maybe I'll
reach out even though you're already at
very high levels what
what makes you keep on reaching out to
coaches
and I'm sure there's people listening at

[2:04:30]
and I'm sure there's people listening at
Hunter now that say I don't need a coach
that's why you know this person
listening is like hey I say that I'm
alone I don't need a coach this guy is
playing up to 10kno and he's still
looking for coaches there's a different
mentality here
uh like

[2:04:46]
uh like
the The Urge for learning for knowledge
I think is is
very important like it's the main tribe
driven
driver to
to get there
and

[2:05:02]
like
I I think it's very funny enjoyable to
like what we are doing when we we do
sessions me you and and sunny for
example and we uh in Mattel there are

[2:05:17]
example and we uh in Mattel there are
things very different from from us all I
guess uh
it's interesting to know that a game
that is two cards in your hand like

[2:05:30]
that is two cards in your hand like
normal image for sure uh two cards cards
in your hand the opponent has two cards
and we have five five cards on the deck
on the table and everyone's thinks
differently about this and even that we
have silvers for eight years like

[2:05:47]
have silvers for eight years like
popular solvers for eight years now I
guess uh
everyone still get the different at the
ideas about some things
and not like someone we can rule out

[2:06:00]
and not like someone we can rule out
like wrong ideas we we already know that
doesn't work that way but uh a lot of
the stuff a lot of different views point
of views about the same spot makes you
uh very very different in most of the

[2:06:18]
uh very very different in most of the
time better player than he was before
this this contact between you and this
new idea and this new person that
especially because these guys that I
reached out and worked worked with them

[2:06:32]
reached out and worked worked with them
uh was playing way higher than me by the
time so
knowing for example
still in this very day uh I I don't know
if

[2:06:45]
if
one or two people
know how Stefan plays like you Stefan
one one two two yeah so it's limping
around now yeah he's doing that but
anything you you get Stefan and Dad

[2:07:04]
anything you you get Stefan and Dad
and Linus and Kevin these days Kevin
pack and all these guys
they have the same idea about the game
but they execute them differently and

[2:07:17]
but they execute them differently and
still gets money and still are like
having fun while play and
maybe I guess like some are more likes
more simplified strategies and some

[2:07:32]
more simplified strategies and some
don't but that doesn't mean that
they are like one is worse than the
other you know
and so I I like I think I I can say I I
like possibilities like the more

[2:07:46]
like possibilities like the more
possibilities I have to
uh in my mind and in my hand to choose
from I think it's better because then
you can rely on on what you know and for
example if uh

[2:08:02]
example if uh
online pokers dies
for whatever reason we still have live
poker and on live poker these days some
guys still use GTO servers on the table

[2:08:15]
guys still use GTO servers on the table
I think this we have this uh
this happening in these days
but if we
knew that like we walked on a bike like

[2:08:31]
knew that like we walked on a bike like
we riding a bike and no one can take
this for us you know so if you know and
you know a lot and you know a lot of
different possibilities of making the
same thing uh it's up to you and to pick

[2:08:46]
same thing uh it's up to you and to pick
the best one for the moment that you are
in
go with it
yeah I think it's also understanding
that you just have a perspective of the
game that works for you but that there's

[2:09:00]
game that works for you but that there's
multiple perspectives to the game that
can work right and that by maybe having
a perspective of someone on someone else
especially if you reach out to coach who
play higher or successful you know you
you pay to get sort of guaranteed that
they will probably give you a new

[2:09:15]
they will probably give you a new
perspective right and to but obviously
to a certain degree if you just team up
with other guys that may play the same
stake they will also share different
perspectives about you know certain
situations I'm sure you know some are
better and some are gonna be worse and
that's how you kind of learn from each
other

[2:09:30]
other
um
I was curious like you were you went
from hunting out to 10 in like around
four years can you take us to like a day
or week in the life of uh Mateos you

[2:09:45]
or week in the life of uh Mateos you
know this is the improved version right
you already you're doing uh you're being
consistent and that's mainly because you
stop drinking you're sleeping well
you're exercising right you're taking
time off was very important rest how did
how does like you mentioned routines a

[2:10:01]
how does like you mentioned routines a
lot I heard you say the word routines
what were like some of the routines that
you instill so how did like a day of the
life of Mateos look like you mentioned
you had certain study routines you can't
take us through like a day or week in
the life of Mateos back then

[2:10:15]
the life of Mateos back then
mm-hmm
um my wife I joke with about this about
it with my life wife a lot is
she asked me how was your day and I say
oh today was very different I studied I

[2:10:33]
oh today was very different I studied I
worked
and that's it and she what the [ __ ]
every day but my work was that I talked
to I meet some I do some meetings I
didn't say okay or what level or

[2:10:45]
didn't say okay or what level or
whatever uh and okay but to summarize
what I do is
wake up uh walk out the dogs
um
take breath breakfast
study for one or two hours then I go

[2:11:02]
study for one or two hours then I go
grind
then I take some time off probably three
hours four hours around
12 in four o'clock on the evening
uh uh on on this time I do somehow stuff

[2:11:17]
uh uh on on this time I do somehow stuff
run some errands uh go to the gym Etc
and then I came back come back uh and
work
until the game's broke or till I feel

[2:11:31]
until the game's broke or till I feel
like working so probably it sounds
six hours five or six hours of play
on a regular day and on the days that
I'm kind of off balance I

[2:11:46]
I'm kind of off balance I
grind around 10 hours
some like divided in two sessions or
four hours or six hours
and the rest is the same
like study in the morning and play the

[2:12:01]
like study in the morning and play the
rest of the day study in the morning
playing the rest of the day and on the
weekends I try not to think about poker
at all but we end up thinking about it
we can help ourselves
and but I try not to grind at all and

[2:12:16]
and but I try not to grind at all and
just enjoy life and rest because
we are past 30 and the time is that the
clocks yeah yeah so you start to notice
the difference when you when you say
study like how does a how does a an hour

[2:12:30]
study like how does a how does a an hour
or two hour study session for you look
like do you review the sessions of the
hands of the last day or are you very
deliberate in terms of okay I have right
I have certain areas of the game too
like for example you mentioned Berlin
turns three web pods that I'm going to
work out a strategy or how does that

[2:12:45]
work out a strategy or how does that
look like
first on
when I started with goose I established
the
framework that was built around
confidence my confidence in certain
spots so I ranked them and the mark of

[2:13:04]
spots so I ranked them and the mark of
confident I was the less I study about
it and the goal was to get confident or
at least half confident on most possible

[2:13:15]
at least half confident on most possible
most spot what's possible
uh but these days that I kind of
confident in most spots I just review
your hands that I marked and when I see
something that's kind of off or that I'm

[2:13:30]
something that's kind of off or that I'm
not like I already knew but I didn't do
by the time I dive deep on that to
kinda solidify what I
thought that I knew but I didn't knew
that truly you know so it's very

[2:13:47]
that truly you know so it's very
uh open these days
oh yeah that makes a lot of sense right
so basically what Chris was saying is
let's say for example rank from 0 to 10
let's say I have a spot that's an eight
you can put an extra work to make it a
nine but if there's another spot that's

[2:14:00]
nine but if there's another spot that's
a five you know you could probably lift
it to a seven with the same amount of
work so you gain two points instead of
an eight to a nine right and I think
also if there's less spots that trigger
insecurity in your session you're just
gonna naturally play your b game or a

[2:14:16]
gonna naturally play your b game or a
game more often right because you're
more in flow and therefore you will play
that spot better as well so I think this
both from a technical perspective and a
mental banking perspective performance
perspective it's a very beneficial
approach I guess also frequency of the
spot was important here like oh uh yeah

[2:14:31]
spot was important here like oh uh yeah
a river Checker is in the four but Bots
exactly so we're talking we're talking
just freaking spots like single right
spots in position single response out of
position as Defender and stuff like that
yeah I think that's uh that's very

[2:14:47]
yeah I think that's uh that's very
that's that's uh that's very effective I
know you do coaching yourself as well
um
what are like
some of the most common leaks that you
see that a lot of you students have in

[2:15:01]
see that a lot of you students have in
common when they come to you
leveling themselves
like
this guy is playing one limits above me
so he's better than me well

[2:15:17]
so he's better than me well
stop that please because uh you're just
going to
project in him that he do everything
right then you're doing something wrong
so you're already losing when you're

[2:15:30]
so you're already losing when you're
thinking like that
uh the other leak is
trying to over complicate things
no yeah I I got to achieve some kind of
frequency with this exact hand he checks

[2:15:46]
frequency with this exact hand he checks
uh this hand checks 15 check raises 70
and the rest is going to be over bet
between overbats and three quarters and
and I I say
okay if you're going to spend that

[2:16:01]
okay if you're going to spend that
energy in one hand in a session
or you're going to end the the session
burned out or you're not going to play
the other hands while this one is
happening uh close near closely to what

[2:16:15]
happening uh close near closely to what
you already knew
and
the other is trying to but that's my
case of of the people reaching out for
me is
trying to

[2:16:31]
trying to
get short shortcuts
and follow blueprints like how is the
what is the blueprint for this exact

[2:16:45]
what is the blueprint for this exact
line
and I I said if you ask me that I say I
don't know I really don't know I don't
don't have any idea
yeah it's I do yeah it's also because
the question is is asked is too broad
it's like uh do people Bluff the river

[2:17:01]
it's like uh do people Bluff the river
at Hunter now yeah what kind of question
yeah there's a problem with the question
like it's it's more nuanced than this
right yeah check bet line uh small size
they Bluff enough and like what the [ __ ]

[2:17:17]
they Bluff enough and like what the [ __ ]
I don't know you know knowing that that
answer if I give you the answer is going
to help you again
for real
are you sure but I mean this is it's
funny so this is what like a lot of the
blueprint type of coaching is bit is

[2:17:32]
blueprint type of coaching is bit is
built around right it satisfies the need
of the customers because people want
shortcuts people want poker to be easy I
always I always say listen let's start
off poker is not easy okay obviously you
can make it more complicated than needed

[2:17:45]
can make it more complicated than needed
but it's not you easy and I usually try
with my coaching I try to focus more on
let's say for example you have the
blueprint okay and they show certain
outcomes that certain lines are under
blood certain lines are overblocked I
think it's way more interesting to see
what went wrong for that to happen and

[2:18:02]
what went wrong for that to happen and
what can we learn from that so you can
estimate situations and if you know that
for example uh yeah villains Bluff
allowance here is very low that means he
has a lot of error he's not allowed to
Bluff a lot and another spot that's vice
versa and that leads to a spot being

[2:18:17]
versa and that leads to a spot being
overlooked under bluffed then you can
ask yourself in the situation instead of
what did the blueprint say you can ask
what is this Bluff allowance here and
based on that will be likely that my
opponent will over buffer on the bluff
and it's it's you will come to the same
conclusion

[2:18:31]
conclusion
but one is why base and the other one is
what base the what base is the blueprint
the right price is the concept behind
the the leak right and that's I think
also what you're saying it it it gives
you a better framework to think and you
can estimate better situations you're

[2:18:46]
can estimate better situations you're
you're not restricted in oh I have to
follow the blueprint exactly and when I
work with no yeah go ahead go ahead okay
uh when I work at that a lot of the
times I was asking for him uh asking him

[2:19:00]
times I was asking for him uh asking him
about okay this frequency uh on my game
right on the turn I'm barely
a lot for example
and he said okay no the not not let uh

[2:19:17]
and he said okay no the not not let uh
let's not face this problem this way
let's think about it qualitative and not
like on frequency wise so let's say
let's see what are you doing wrong like
you said right now and how you're

[2:19:32]
you said right now and how you're
building this strategy and fix it
instead of okay you have to go lower
your frequencies here three percent yeah
you have to understand so basically he
said let's see how you constructed your
range that let you to have a frequency

[2:19:47]
range that let you to have a frequency
that's out of line it's for example
let's say you have uh
let's say you're in position as initial
razor you see that flop check back turn
and your overfold versus a river Pro and
you can say hey your status off lower

[2:20:00]
you can say hey your status off lower
your River flow to probe but if you've
constructed a very strong bet range then
you only have [ __ ] hands on the river
and you're like oh [ __ ] but I have to
call more and every time you're calling
[ __ ] you know every time you arrive at
the river with Ace highs low Pairs and
you're just spewing of money I mean your

[2:20:16]
you're just spewing of money I mean your
step did go lower but you didn't realize
that the league actually happened on the
turn right exactly you had to understand
why what what where does it go wrong in
terms of my range construction right
this is but usually if you have a leak

[2:20:31]
this is but usually if you have a leak
frequency wise you usually have to see
okay the previous Street I could have
make a decision probably that's where it
went wrong right if uh if you know your
uh if you're uh yeah if your fault first

[2:20:46]
uh if you're uh yeah if your fault first
delay is very high that's maybe because
you your step is way too strong for
example you don't carry enough hands to
the turn that could defend the late
seabed right they're usually they go
hand in hand the two steps so that's uh

[2:21:01]
hand in hand the two steps so that's uh
that's I think is very good advice but
obviously we had that on the very very
smart guy of course so if you could
let's say for example you have someone
uh for a one hour coaching session and
you can explain him three things what

[2:21:15]
you can explain him three things what
would be the the three things that you
will explain
me explaining yeah so you get one hour
you get to explain three concepts to
help the guy what would those three
concepts be
um
MF behind hey rake the map right that's

[2:21:32]
MF behind hey rake the map right that's
actually a very good one one so playing
a game that's actually beatable that's
pretty nice yeah okay
[Music]
um
the balance probably the balance between

[2:21:46]
the balance probably the balance between
uh when someone shifts for one side you
shift to another
okay for example if the guy over blows
or over aggressive on the street
you kinda over call I I don't like to

[2:22:00]
you kinda over call I I don't like to
use that terms on flop turns okay but I
think you'll get it
um this balance because it's kind of a
logical adjustment and people somewhat
somehow and sometimes uh deviates from

[2:22:15]
somehow and sometimes uh deviates from
that
entered
I don't uh how to
tag players probably
let's start with the fact that you can

[2:22:30]
let's start with the fact that you can
attack players in various ways yeah
right some people have wrecked fish I'm
like okay there's problems why'd you
have a wreck fish a fish rack you know
yeah I think this tree and why why why
is it so important you think

[2:22:45]
is it so important you think
because I cannot
in one and a half hour I cannot
teach him how to use the sofa because if
I had to teach just one thing I would
teach how to use this over but these are
the three things he if he can like wrap

[2:23:04]
the three things he if he can like wrap
his head around the logical behind it
the the logic behind it he kinda can win
games win in the games right
yeah because he will know how to adjust

[2:23:16]
yeah because he will know how to adjust
he knows where when and where he can win
and how these are just this is actually
a very good go-to sensor so first you
tell them you play actually beatable
then you start to tack racks in

[2:23:32]
then you start to tack racks in
different ways and basically based on
certain texts you will over color over
fold correct yeah because like that's
actually a rule of thumb nice this is an
excellent coaching session it's an

[2:23:45]
excellent coaching session
oh
hi guys Renee aka the weko here with a
quick mechanics of Poker 2.0

and one-on-one coaching session in which
we are going to be reviewing if you have
been implementing the stuff that we
teach you in the mechanics of Poker
correctly so do you think you have what
it takes to master the mechanics of

[2:25:31]
it takes to master the mechanics of
Poker go over to mechanics of poker.com
and maybe you will get a chance to work
with me and Adam and make more progress
in your poker career but for now without
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode

[2:25:47]
goodness in today's episode
Adam in your uh in your tagging career
if you uh if you attacked according to
uh mateos's philosophy
yeah I would tag I wouldn't take many
people good and I think the psychology

[2:26:00]
people good and I think the psychology
behind that's very strong like why tiger
player good or better than you it's just
gonna create a mindset block that
they've got a good strategy and they um
said you're going to project things onto
them I generally had like a varying
degrees of bad which is quite
disrespectful to my reg opponents um but

[2:26:17]
disrespectful to my reg opponents um but
I knew what they meant in terms of that
aggression obviously you need to uh have
a way to tag aggression you need a way
to tag passive people because you're
going to deviate strategies either side
of that and then how granular you want
to go I think is a kind of personal
preference also how many tables you're

[2:26:30]
preference also how many tables you're
playing I think your table count will
matter if you're playing lots of tables
having a good tagging system so you can
see the colors quite quickly
um it's going to be more important so
yeah I think it's it's not in that but
uh yeah I mean those three points from
Matthias for a one-off study session
were great very linear they covered a

[2:26:45]
were great very linear they covered a
lot of fundamentals but yeah I think
they would construct a very good
approach to poker for a kind of beginner
player to uh to pick up on so really
good colors are very effective because
it kind of sums up a profile of a player
that's why for example with hot stats as
well I like to work with colors if a

[2:27:01]
well I like to work with colors if a
certain stat is out of a range added to
the left or the right it either turns
red or green so then if I see someone's
hot it's primarily green or primarily
red it kind of gives me an idea of his
overall style right and then based on

[2:27:15]
overall style right and then based on
that it's exactly what Mateo said I will
lean towards okay Bluff catch scenario
well guys green probably fault oh guys
red probably call so quite solid solid
advice here
um and yeah I think a lot of us are
visual people as well so uh seeing that

[2:27:31]
visual people as well so uh seeing that
visual color just like triggers a lot
like you might say green or you might
say Reds but behind the scenes your
mind's going oh he does this he does
that and you've already created like a
kind of a default strategy to deal with
that player of like a stop color so yeah
I think it's can be very powerful once
you've built a framework

[2:27:45]
you've built a framework
all right I want to do a little bit of
reflecting for you now Matia so you've
had a long career we've covered some ups
and downs of it and I want to do a
little bit of looking back and getting
some kind of lessons we can take for for
the audience so uh first question is
what do you wish you had known starting
out

[2:28:01]
um
like like Renee said poker is not easy
like it's not easy
uh this properly and I I
I would be very happy if I know that

[2:28:16]
I would be very happy if I know that
it's not easy and that you really has
have to be consistent on the work you're
the working hours you're putting on that
if you knew it wasn't easy starting out
do you still feel like you would have

[2:28:30]
do you still feel like you would have
started on the same poker path yeah sure
yeah 100
yeah because I think often like it we do
like startup and Pursuits and we're
naive because we don't know what it
involves whether it's poker with
something else but sometimes like
naivety can get us going because if we

[2:28:46]
naivety can get us going because if we
knew this is a 10-year slog together and
we might be like I'm gonna do something
easier because this is hard so sometimes
it can get us started but it sounds like
your personality you would have ran
straight into the the challenge
um and and when it held you back at all

[2:29:00]
um and and when it held you back at all
and next question is what do you think
is being the greatest contributor to
your success we mentioned consistency so
you can't use consistency answer what
else has been a great contributor to
your success as a poker player
um

[2:29:15]
[Music]
being competitive and uh
surrounding myself with the right people
and I I think that's very important
probably more important than being

[2:29:30]
probably more important than being
competitive because like not owning life
because the people cheering you up and
rooting for you and that going to follow
you along the journey matters but for
example Renee that picked me up on the
streets like he helped me a lot

[2:29:47]
streets like he helped me a lot
uh Goods that helped me a lot to that
helped me a lot too
um the guys that taught me sometimes
then give you some answers that you're
when you're kind of lost and give you

[2:30:01]
when you're kind of lost and give you
some advices because they know better
they already uh walk that path that you
are trying to walk
and that's very important because uh
especially because in poker I think your

[2:30:15]
especially because in poker I think your
uh your your name oh how we say that
like it's very important being
respectful being someone that is
reliable is very important uh especially
because

[2:30:30]
because
that's all we have right I never met you
I never met the Renee in real life but
if you we trusted each other we can do
whatever we want right
yeah very powerful so a follow question

[2:30:45]
yeah very powerful so a follow question
is how do you find the right people
let's say someone's watching this and
like everyone keeps saying I need the
right people around me I need high
stakes players who can motivate me and
take me forwards but I've got nobody
it's just me and my on my computer
grinding how do you go about going from
like a solo grinder which most people

[2:31:00]
like a solo grinder which most people
start out how do you start creating that
Network how do you start finding the
right people who can help you or
collaborate with you
hmm
I think
probably the people giving you the right

[2:31:18]
probably the people giving you the right
questions are more important the the
ones that are trying to sell you the
easy answers
so this problem interesting to to keep

[2:31:30]
so this problem interesting to to keep
in mind and
the ones that are not like they are
their
on the path that you crossed like
they're playing the same games for

[2:31:45]
they're playing the same games for
example
or the ones that already crossed the
path or already that drill the this this
road
and are kinda rooting for you not the
ones that are okay you are an upswing

[2:32:00]
ones that are okay you are an upswing
I'm not a downswing I'm very bad I'm I
have no luck and you are very lucky no
get away from these people okay
uh be with the ones that are thinking I
like I think that's very important
yeah I think the summarize like Leica

[2:32:16]
yeah I think the summarize like Leica
tracks like as you're speaking that
little story came to my head of like
someone chopping through the woods like
they're trying to find their path and
it's all Woods everywhere as you're
chopping through it you find like a path
to come for the woods you're like oh my
God there's a path going through and you
see some of the guy on the path you're
like hey how did you get yeah and he's
been chopping through the woods on the

[2:32:31]
been chopping through the woods on the
other side and he's got the same path
you start meeting people on the journey
I think sometimes the kind of synergy of
life when we're on a pursuit of
something it's amazing how so often we
meet people we're on the same Journey as
us they might not be the same place
they've got their own stuff going on
they've got other goals that they're

[2:32:45]
they've got other goals that they're
reaching to but at the same time there's
a direction that we're both going in and
we overlap on so many things that will
connect at some point there'll be an
overlap in our paths where there'll be
an elements where we can connect and
like you said then it's about the right
people it's the people who question you
who don't give you the easy option to uh

[2:33:01]
who don't give you the easy option to uh
help you when you're going down who have
your best interests at heart or at least
are pushing you to be a better version
yourself so yeah I think those are
really good and I think also which kind
of overlapses a lot of the conversation
is be patient if someone's listening to
this who hasn't got the right people in

[2:33:15]
this who hasn't got the right people in
their life right now be patient keep
going in your direction you'll pick up
those people on the way be mindful be
present look out for the the right
people at the right times but I think if
you're on the journey long enough you
will over time attract the people who
who you need to
all right next question is what's the

[2:33:31]
all right next question is what's the
one thing that poker has taught you that
you didn't expect starting out
a grasp of what variance is and what
luck is oh did you learn that one the
hard way

[2:33:48]
because it works both ways but on a
day-to-day life on a regular life let's
say let's put it like that people like

[2:34:00]
say let's put it like that people like
overestimate the the their
like
they overestimate how powerful they were
they are controlling their lives
uh in when you get to Pokemon you

[2:34:17]
uh in when you get to Pokemon you
you get 100 sure that you the only thing
you can do is doing the right thing
because the outcome you never know like
you you can do the the same thing it's a

[2:34:30]
you you can do the the same thing it's a
100 silver approved it's 100 real life
approved and you can lose 100 times
straight and still going to be the right
thing and if you don't have that in your
mind and you don't know how that works
uh you're going to dub yourself and be

[2:34:47]
uh you're going to dub yourself and be
uh in a very bad place of mind like
very often yeah I think poker's like a
crash course in probabilities and
dealing with uncertainty it's almost

[2:35:00]
dealing with uncertainty it's almost
like getting a degree in real life
experience not on paper it's like you
live that this is what probability feels
like in the body this is I think all of
us getting into poker have probably been
shocked at some points and How how Wild
varians can go like when you're playing
great you're making great decisions how

[2:35:16]
great you're making great decisions how
much bearings can go against you I'm
sure we've all run calculations on is
this real like how how extreme covarians
go am I an outlier because probabilities
in real time in real life do play out
like really skewed and yeah I think
understanding those from both a logical

[2:35:30]
understanding those from both a logical
level but even more importantly on an
emotional level because there's a lot of
people who understand variance by
looking at a calculator but when they
experience it they go through it for a
tough time their emotions get dragged
around so I think both of those kind of
go hand in hand they deal with
uncertainty from an emotional level and

[2:35:45]
uncertainty from an emotional level and
also from a logical level to uh to kind
of keep you kind of in a sentence place
all right next question is what mindset
shifts have been pivotal in your
transition from law sticks to high
stakes in particular the second
transition so not the the first two
years when you crash back down when

[2:36:00]
years when you crash back down when
you're being able to sustain yourself at
high stakes what are these are the
mindset shifts you've had to make
[Music]
every little thing matters in
rest is
overpowered

[2:36:16]
overpowered
like rest to perform in the high level
you gotta be
uh rested like that's it and people just
they don't most of them don't and
especially as as older we get

[2:36:32]
especially as as older we get
as uh the more we get the grasp of how
it works in your body and how we are
still humans right yeah we are still
somewhat intelligent monkeys that could

[2:36:46]
somewhat intelligent monkeys that could
go to Earth and we're close but uh
it's very important to respect that
respect our natural uh bodies and water
your bodies and your minds are telling
us to do because they they give give us

[2:37:02]
us to do because they they give give us
the signs and somewhat we somehow we
just ignore them
um yeah I think that's true but we
ignore them because we shut them off or
we're not paying attention and I had a

[2:37:15]
we're not paying attention and I had a
quote like if we don't hear the whisper
don't listen to The Whispers we're
forced to hear the screams and the
body's always giving you those kind of
noises of Warning Sign one inside but if
you've not you don't listen to that at
some points you're helpful deteriorate
you'll burn out you're in a position
where whoa how do they get to you yeah

[2:37:30]
where whoa how do they get to you yeah
so follow up with that is how did what
do you do to prioritize recovery let's
say we've had the realization recovery
really matters what are two or three
things you do on a regular basis to make
sure you get enough recovery
um

[2:37:45]
dealing uh with social network uh till
some point of the day to life
Max 8 pm
and getting this off because this can go

[2:38:01]
and getting this off because this can go
stickling new all the day okay here here
so look at this solve this problem oh
this promotion all this this thing oh
did you see the new look of the
president or or the Prince Harry I I

[2:38:16]
president or or the Prince Harry I I
[ __ ] Prince Harry I don't know what I
don't wanna know but he's wearing uh and
if you you get on this roller coaster of
social media you like it's

[2:38:31]
social media you like it's
today like in these days uh they have a
lot of studies of this
um
Dynamic that that we are now that is
this
um
attention seeking world that we are

[2:38:47]
attention seeking world that we are
accepting right now
and that's kind of drivers
especially
drivers uh

[2:39:00]
drivers uh
dump and numb and in some cases we we
just get uh sick with it and that's one
point the second point is
do exercises the one that fits you in

[2:39:17]
do exercises the one that fits you in
your day because it helps a lot with
[Music]
guardian rhythm
I think that's called
um
so you can kinda reset your body while

[2:39:33]
so you can kinda reset your body while
sleeping
and three would be enjoy life enjoy
things you you enjoy doing
like I I had one on Coach uh back uh

[2:39:48]
like I I had one on Coach uh back uh
three three years back that he loved to
mock his clients saying okay the guy he
was playing like seven for seven days he
was playing like 25 hours a day or 15

[2:40:02]
was playing like 25 hours a day or 15
hours a day
and no I'm making much money I'm making
more I'm making I have six figures a
month and he just asked the guy
are you getting late

[2:40:15]
are you getting late
[Laughter]
I don't know because it's tough my
routine
and do do what whatever makes you feel
good and that helps you to re-energize

[2:40:33]
good and that helps you to re-energize
or
be rested when you are in the tables to
perform
um yeah great great advice and yeah I
think that it varies for all of us like

[2:40:46]
think that it varies for all of us like
what things we do to have fun generally
it's getting away with my devices it's
been with other people it's doing
something for its own purpose or
whatever that is for you whether it's
just hanging with friends or it's
reading a book or meditating but
certainly something that isn't work work

[2:41:00]
certainly something that isn't work work
related or goal orientated Journey for
me personally as well that's the things
that energize me and then yeah I think
exercise is an underrated tool for
everyone like we were built to move our
bodies are not meant to be selling
computers all day I think poker players
especially the high volume Grinders I
think you probably fall in that category

[2:41:15]
think you probably fall in that category
can definitely go into periods of time
where you just don't move enough you
don't move your body and before you know
it leaves the burnout health problems
come you just don't feel your best self
which is never a good experience then
you mentioned also being off social
media and yeah creating some space where
you're not in that kind of rabbit Hall

[2:41:30]
you're not in that kind of rabbit Hall
of consuming information which again
poker players are very prone to uh over
consumption of ideas knowledge but also
of social media as well too again Escape
those problems that you're having but
the easy quick the quick dopamine hits
is so addictive as much
just grab your device and spend an hour

[2:41:45]
just grab your device and spend an hour
aimlessly scroll in is very hard to to
keep obviously it creates some
boundaries to uh give some space is
really really important all right find a
question from me is what does
self-reflection and self evaluation look
like for yourself and how is it played a
role in your growth as a poker player

[2:42:02]
role in your growth as a poker player
it cut both ways because
sometimes I I'm very harsh on myself
in one way it helps because you you're

[2:42:15]
in one way it helps because you you're
never done you're never finished when
like I'm playing 5K for example right
now and but that's enough not enough
that's uh it doesn't satisfy satisfy me
uh as much as I thought it would but

[2:42:32]
uh as much as I thought it would but
when I started it uh
so it's good for one perspective but on
the other hand
it's kind of tiring like because you
you're has Restless you're never done

[2:42:47]
you're has Restless you're never done
you're never
uh satisfied you're never enough for
yourself and that's kind of yeah I I
feel it's it's bad somehow somehow but

[2:43:00]
feel it's it's bad somehow somehow but
it's good because
um
we all always have a goal to reach a new
goal or if the one doesn't fulfill me
anymore I'm going to another one going
for uh doing like Rene said I like

[2:43:17]
for uh doing like Rene said I like
photography I like making videos so okay
I'm tired of Poker that's not for me
anymore I'm going for that and we have
at least 40 years ahead of us so let's

[2:43:32]
at least 40 years ahead of us so let's
go let's let's pursue something whatever
is it's it's good for you yes it's only
it played two roles your self-reflection
one is like two seek goals and what's
next and how to get better but if you

[2:43:46]
next and how to get better but if you
push that to his extreme it can lead to
like a hollow feeling of it's I'm never
enough I'm never gonna have what I want
and every time I get a goal it feels
less than what I thought it was going
out and the next goal appears and it's
always in motion but it sounds like you
had a nice balance for that where you
also realize ah wait a second maybe I

[2:44:01]
also realize ah wait a second maybe I
need to stop doing work right now go
make some movies or videos that you'd
like to make or do something enjoy I
think get that balance and
self-reflection can be from both angles
it can tell us when we're out of balance
it can tell someone to push harder it's
almost like checking in how do I check
in with myself and keep keep track and I

[2:44:15]
in with myself and keep keep track and I
think it's it's amazing like how many
people don't reflect they don't check in
with are you doing the things you want
to in your life and is your life going
in the direction that you wanted to if
not you can change it so yeah I think
the it sounds like you've got some good
checks in place to uh to make sure
you're on the right path I want to say

[2:44:30]
you're on the right path I want to say
go to you right now ready I know you're
a very good self-reflector and one of
the things or practices you've done to
uh fine-tune yourself reflection skills
I think for most of your career for my
what I've understood you've been someone
who's yeah been very good at inquiring
about yourself been using
self-reflection uh journaling big one I

[2:44:47]
self-reflection uh journaling big one I
think that's that's immediately the one
that stands out I go on and off uh with
journaling I've had journaling routines
either morning or night where I was very
consistent then it fell off nowadays
it's more

[2:45:00]
it's more
when there's certain thoughts or
feelings that I notice
that suddenly become present during
certain periods I'll grab out a piece of
paper go sit down and just write down
everything that comes to my mind like
what do I feel what do I think and try

[2:45:16]
what do I feel what do I think and try
to kind of connect the dots I think so
sort of what Mateo said about therapy
the fact that you put it out there I
have the same way you write it on paper
also it becomes more organized right if
there's a lot of stuff going on in your
mind with emotions thoughts and if you

[2:45:31]
mind with emotions thoughts and if you
write them down it's like ah so that's
how it looks like it gives you like a
certain a certain sense of peace and in
terms of like if we talk a bit more like
poker performance related there's
obviously a lot of metrics that you can
check to see you know let's say if you

[2:45:47]
check to see you know let's say if you
played if you actually played the amount
of hands that you said that you were
going to play if you did the amount of
study hours but also from a statistical
perspective I think it's always good to
uh you know on a very frequent basis it
needs to kind of take a look at your hot

[2:46:00]
needs to kind of take a look at your hot
stats to see if not certain leaks fall
in that you've become unaware of right
let's say for example you only do the
check-in once a year you might at the
end of the year came to Google oh
actually I was leaking in this area
whereas if you would have looked at that
after three months you could have
already corrected it right

[2:46:16]
already corrected it right
so I'm uh I'm a very big one on that
basically also after sessions I usually
evaluate myself on certain points that
at the moment for me are important so
yeah that's kind of the main reflection
uh reflection word that uh that comes up

[2:46:31]
uh reflection word that uh that comes up
I have a question for you actually Adam
uh because Mateus pointed out and I've
heard this throughout many podcasts
about being competitive right I think
that's something that uh that Mateos
pointed out
how does someone become more competitive

[2:46:48]
how does someone become more competitive
because I feel like being competitive is
a bit more installed within you but I
know you are usually of the believer
that you know you can cultivate anything
is it more or at least than how I
thought about that and you can recommend

[2:47:01]
thought about that and you can recommend
from wrong is it then more changing your
relationship to competitiveness that's
the solution
yes I think it's looking at if you zoom
out it's like what does competition give
people all right so what do we get we're
all competitive what do we get from
being competitive generally we get to

[2:47:16]
being competitive generally we get to
win hopefully we get to become better
versions of ourselves we get to compete
with other people on a fair playing
grounds and there's this kind of a lot
of it in our youth competitions with
people we can be with people with our
friends with sports and this is kind of
um doing things with other people and

[2:47:30]
um doing things with other people and
trying to be better than them so I think
for myself like I get a lot of intrinsic
motivation as well as extrinsic from the
pursuit of competing so if you don't
have those let's say you're not a
competitive person how do you spark that
well first of all I'm gonna ask why
would you want to why would you want to
be more competitive and then you want to
change your relationship with why you

[2:47:46]
change your relationship with why you
would like to compete and I think
sometimes the the competition when
people don't like to compete is because
they don't like the the thought of
winning losing there being a winner and
being a loser so if you could change
your relationship to something more
meaningful yourself so competition could
be just linked to growth your own

[2:48:01]
be just linked to growth your own
personal becoming a better version
yourself I think everyone can tap into a
competitive Drive that's linked to there
on themselves become a better version of
self over time so yeah I think it's
exactly what you said it's the
relationship with what you're doing and
then create an element of competition

[2:48:16]
then create an element of competition
either with yourself or the people to
spark more growth and improvements um on
that Pursuit and then mainly your
relationship with losing because winning
no one has a problem with it right
Everyone likes winning it's more the
other side of the coin that they're like
yeah maybe I should you know maybe I

[2:48:31]
yeah maybe I should you know maybe I
should keep my competitive I mean why
would you want to it seems to be a team
throughout everyone that we have on I
think we've had
I've I don't think we've had anyone on
that was not competitive literally you
know it's always sort of pre-selection

[2:48:45]
know it's always sort of pre-selection
right that people get into poker
naturally are more competitive but just
out of curiosity you know for people
that are listening they're like I should
become more competitive and I was
thinking about yeah how do you actually
become more competitive but your answer
uh your answer I think gives uh gives

[2:49:00]
uh your answer I think gives uh gives
more tangible things for people to work
on so thank you for that uh
getting more into a present day and uh
wrapping up the the pot Mateos going
forward what are some of your goals in
poker what's currently driving you to

[2:49:16]
poker what's currently driving you to
keep pursuing those
um helping other people
always helping other people yeah
actually you that's also is that one of
the reasons why you also went to do
coaching
uh

[2:49:30]
uh
um and
building uh higher bankroll
to play higher again like 10K for the
king and
uh and try I'm thinking about uh giving

[2:49:48]
uh and try I'm thinking about uh giving
some shots on live poker
mainly for tournaments because as we
spoke in the past uh
it's good to meet no new people right
and you're playing you have a the guy is

[2:50:01]
and you're playing you have a the guy is
telling how he he works his life true
and where he lives and he lives like in
completely different world than yours
and that's funny and and enjoyable too

[2:50:15]
and that's funny and and enjoyable too
to know yeah you get to know more people
behind the player right whereas online
it's just a player hey online is just a
play and in life there's a lot of money
to begin live on live poker too so it's

[2:50:30]
to begin live on live poker too so it's
I think it's the same game but A New
Perspective and a new thing to
work again in my strategies because
we should always write

[2:50:45]
we should always write
so what is something like from a
strategy perspective that
you are currently working on and then
you fit that you think that you still
need to improve in order to you know
play with the play with the linuses the
stefans the Mikey boyfriends at the 20
40K tables

[2:51:05]
and fish in the table
is one thing that
right
that was lesson number one this can be
rain this can be uh Recreation at the

[2:51:16]
rain this can be uh Recreation at the
table
second is some heads up yeah I gotta to
get my heads up getting better like I
get to level up my game because I I
[Music]

[2:51:30]
[Music]
it gives a A Whole New Perspective in
the game uh about
I think combinatorics like
it helps you to
a few more
uh how it interacts

[2:51:49]
um
and as soon as I I think was on your
podcast that clinty was saying that he
can play Stefan heads up right but he
he can but he's he might his mind can't

[2:52:02]
he can but he's he might his mind can't
right yeah more than one hour yeah
because every in every 10 hands the
stack went in yeah in like
I think I'm more on the other side
I can't still can't uh uh did today I

[2:52:20]
I can't still can't uh uh did today I
can work on being able to play him
uh but my I think my mind already can
handle the swings you know

[2:52:30]
handle the swings you know
and it would be fun because if you have
someone even like the goal is not to
lose to him but even if you have uh
someone to play and challenge you every
day uh
it's very good like you sit you play

[2:52:46]
it's very good like you sit you play
heads up your your brains challenge your
body is challenging because you're
trapped in in a chair to play with him
in your fully present and fully
committed to win uh from that guy so it

[2:53:01]
committed to win uh from that guy so it
drives me I think it's very it's very
interesting
I'm also curious what what is something
that still upsets you or like a bad
habit that you have up until today that
you know you shouldn't have but you
still have

[2:53:17]
they done it paid in it
ah yeah yeah it's probably the the thing
that
gets me off my game most uh among all

[2:53:31]
gets me off my game most uh among all
the things because it's like the month
end of okay this guy here is tagged yeah
earlier this morning it happened it was
small blind against big blind the guy
bets
half on ten seven four okay that's one

[2:53:49]
half on ten seven four okay that's one
third on three that complete the Flesh
on the turn Okay straight and Flash
complete and nine came on the river
and he over bets and I just look okay I

[2:54:01]
and he over bets and I just look okay I
have a straight here uh with flesh
blocker but this guy never flew never
Blues it doesn't matter I I like [ __ ] my
blockers I don't need blockers I just
need to fold the tag is is about folding

[2:54:15]
need to fold the tag is is about folding
this guy stacked this as weak because I
need to fall then hit the dead and I
call and he has what foolish obviously
because
I can't see that

[2:54:30]
I can't see that
uh it is probably worth one BP per
hundred or one yeah I think one BP per
100 on the on the on the long term uh on
the long term
so what what is usually like your

[2:54:45]
so what what is usually like your
thought process does that like usually I
can catch myself I'm like yeah but you
know he could maybe have worse
but like you know this is kind of things
that you say to yourself right
also like in this spot like I think

[2:55:02]
also like in this spot like I think
confidence in read also is very
important because like you said straight
with the flush blocker PVB like you have
your my confidence needs to be quite big
in order to fold
so yeah confidence in how neat how big

[2:55:17]
so yeah confidence in how neat how big
the knit is
probably also quite an important one
here
uh also curious I don't think I mean
we've thought you've talked a lot about
like the end goal right the end goal in

[2:55:31]
like the end goal right the end goal in
life uh is to be happy I guess right and
to enjoy our lives so what is your
definition of success
doing the things you enjoy

[2:55:46]
doing the things you enjoy
the most of the time you're able to
yeah
because for example I have one coach in
the gym but not my coach but that works

[2:56:01]
the gym but not my coach but that works
in the gym
and every Wednesday Wednesday not
Thursday every Thursday he says in in
Brazilian we say Sesto

[2:56:15]
Brazilian we say Sesto
that it's oh that we can just started
and every Thursday he says Sisto
because it doesn't work Friday
Saturday uh uh nor Sunday

[2:56:30]
Saturday uh uh nor Sunday
so the guy
has work to do if he want it he would
work on other gyms
and doing other classes Etc
but he he wants to nap on the evening he

[2:56:46]
but he he wants to nap on the evening he
wants to watch movies and the morning or
Friday I don't know he'd like to walk
his dogs and he likes to do nothing
because do nothing is is good too
and this guy reached success that is his

[2:57:01]
and this guy reached success that is his
plan yeah that's a very good one he
seems satisfied yeah besides that's a
very very interesting you know
especially probably a lot of the type of
people that will tune into the podcast
and have been listening to us rambling
and probably Austrian included as well

[2:57:17]
and probably Austrian included as well
satisfied Never Satisfied basically
right like kind of I would always have
the opposite model opposite model Never
Satisfied always continue working but
then yes I already heard this good I

[2:57:31]
then yes I already heard this good I
heard someone
talk about this they say yeah you know
we invest like especially earlier in
your career you invest all this time
time you know to make money then you
become older then you spend all your
money to get your time back so it's a
very interesting Paradox right

[2:57:48]
yeah when you ask I I responded uh the
answer was doing and for some people are
not doing other success like no no I
just do things three days a week for

[2:58:01]
just do things three days a week for
example in for someone is going to be
success I I'm probably more on the side
of doing but not that always have to
correlate with doing some work but doing
things I like to to do yeah but it's

[2:58:17]
things I like to to do yeah but it's
always always good
you know to not lose sight of the end
goal that's also actually why I think
this question is always very powerful
to finish it up what would you like the
main takeaway to be for the audience

[2:58:30]
main takeaway to be for the audience
that they get from the conversation we
had with you today
that is
possible to achieve
a lot
if you put or when you put in the right
work and the right amount of hours in

[2:58:48]
work and the right amount of hours in
the right direction
but that doesn't necessarily mean that
you're going to achieve it
and the goal is to do the things to

[2:59:00]
and the goal is to do the things to
achieve and if you achieve okay but if
you don't uh whatever is life we we
cannot we are not Gods we are just
people passing by and
try and that's that's not the other
thing

[2:59:15]
thing
try to be kind to the people that are
following the
path that you're falling to
beautiful spoken beautifully spoken Adam
any final questions from Mateos
no that was very well put and yeah thank

[2:59:31]
no that was very well put and yeah thank
you very much for your time really
appreciate our conversation I'm sure our
audience is going to love it so thank
you for joining us today
thank you very much guys thanks a lot
thank you Mateos for sharing your wisdom
he had a great journey learned a lot

[2:59:46]
he had a great journey learned a lot
along the way and I'm sure a lot of our
audience will have learned something
hearing him explaining his journey Adam
what were your main takeaways from the
conversation we have with Mateos
yeah great conversation I wrote a lot of
notes down for myself and the first

[3:00:00]
notes down for myself and the first
thing that comes to mind was this notion
of presence and he mentioned feel in the
moment which I thought was a really
powerful phrase that I'll go away from
this conversation with being in the
moment and basically allowing yourself
to experience everything that comes up
and as you talk about early in his
career he struggled with this a lot like

[3:00:15]
career he struggled with this a lot like
for two to four years of his career he
was having troubles because he was
running from his problems he was
grinding like crazy hours but he wasn't
present he wasn't in the moment he was
doing things to uh get him out of his
feelings get him away from his fears but
he wasn't feeling at the moment I think
it's a very brave thing to be able to do

[3:00:31]
it's a very brave thing to be able to do
as a sport player live in a body the ups
and downs and to be fully present and
obviously we're human we don't live in
that state fully unless we've done a few
Decades of meditation uh but generally
trying to feel them all as much as
possible I think it's a really a good
lesson next one was another quote he

[3:00:46]
lesson next one was another quote he
mentioned giving yourself room to make
mistakes and again we're talking about
being in this kind of survival mindset
in his career and when you've gotten a
lot of pressures externally it's really
hard because you haven't got room to
make mistakes so one of the things we
need to do is realize we kind of always

[3:01:00]
need to do is realize we kind of always
have room and honesty unless there's
like you're in an incredibly extreme
situation we almost always have some
room to make mistakes and allow
ourselves permission to try things to
fail to not uh succeed in the short term
uh but I have created life circumstances
which gives you more and more room to

[3:01:15]
which gives you more and more room to
make more mistakes thanks to again a
good model to strive for and the third
one was around balance a very consistent
theme throughout the conversation was
putting an effort over a long period of
time get momentum in your favor we can
tell Matthias is a very hard worker
definitely broken systems routines and

[3:01:30]
definitely broken systems routines and
overall approaches but then he talked
equally about recovery time off balance
getting away from podcasts I think
having those two in town then we've got
this good work ethic you're constantly
moving forward but you also taking time
off you're reflecting okay now I need
more sleep now I need more recovery now

[3:01:45]
more sleep now I need more recovery now
we need to spend time with my loved ones
all these pets these cats in his case so
yeah really good I think he's got an
all-around very nice light for you I
really liked his overall philosophies
around life seem really really spot on
so yeah really enjoyed the compass
however if we celebrating it wasn't the
main things you've wrote down

[3:02:00]
main things you've wrote down
yeah
um I I agree like his overall life go
right I loved the the quote from his
coach that said yeah okay you made a lot
of money you grind a lot but did you get
laid so like having like I'm not saying
High purpose in life is to get late but

[3:02:16]
High purpose in life is to get late but
you know sometimes to not lose track of
the end goal right I think that's
exactly also what we closed the
conversation off with uh he summed up a
lot of good stuff in terms of his
coaching experience and I think he
mentions playing games you beat right he

[3:02:30]
mentions playing games you beat right he
made people aware of rake that was one
and then later also he mentioned make
sure it has a fish in the game when if
he would sit down with Linus Stefan Etc
so playing games you beat and think
about how the Rangers really are and

[3:02:46]
about how the Rangers really are and
adjust accordingly and think about or
you can also do research on how the
ranges really are because how the
Rangers actually are I think this is
actually something that
he also said something like when I show

[3:03:02]
he also said something like when I show
a competent 200 L rack how the ranges
are he will make a good decision the
problem is people don't know how the
ranges really are I'm pretty sure that's
I'm quoting him exactly here this is
basically also what Mateo's saying that
he kind of had an eye-opening moments

[3:03:16]
he kind of had an eye-opening moments
like oh wow the solver is just doing
this
because it's a reaction to how villain's
range is and intuitively actually know
that Fitness range is different and
therefore he felt like a bit uh yeah
pressured that he was trying to play
correct and when he had that realization

[3:03:30]
correct and when he had that realization
he was kind of free to just play with
his intuition and make adjustments based
on how Fitness range really uh is right
and how Vietnam's range is also
dependent on the Tendencies and we we
talked about that that was I think the
third lesson that he said Tech players
right I think in the end he gave an

[3:03:46]
right I think in the end he gave an
example of where he called the knit
again well he has a knit tech for a
reason the guy over by the river there
was a flush he had a straight
intuitively he understood that if his
range is a flush I should fold my
straight but it's obviously not as easy

[3:04:00]
straight but it's obviously not as easy
as that right because we don't have 100
confidence this is a good example of
well if that's the range because of the
profile that he is then our hand is a
fold right so that's kind of a a I think
a very good way of thinking he also
talked about like common leaks the

[3:04:15]
talked about like common leaks the
players had leveling and we've heard
this throughout many conversations right
there we give too much credit to players
who play higher it's also something that
he mentioned
over complicated I think he mentioned
yeah people trying to kneel the exact
frequencies guys we don't have to kneel

[3:04:30]
frequencies guys we don't have to kneel
the exact frequencies okay
the reason that the solver does
everything with a certain frequency is
because the other guy also knows your
strategy and if you would have 100
frequency of one hand to zero percent
frequency of the other hand there will
be drastic consequences to the

[3:04:45]
be drastic consequences to the
equilibrium strategy in practice no one
knows your exact combinations okay so if
you simplify to do a certain hand class
100 time the other one zero okay I'm not
not let's say we have two sort of Bluffs
okay we could both sibet them so it's

[3:05:01]
okay we could both sibet them so it's
doing half the time we did half the time
the other you could just choose one
hundred and the other zero that's not a
problem at all okay it's not about
needing the exact frequencies right
um yeah I think I think that's that's
about it and the last Point actually

[3:05:16]
about it and the last Point actually
that I had wrote written down here is to
work on your weakest area first I think
it's very
common to like to work on things that
we're already good at because we're good
at that right but to take a certain area
from an A to a nine is

[3:05:32]
from an A to a nine is
uh is very hard whereas if you score a
foreign area you can easily get that one
to a seventh so your return your return
of investment there's the hours that you
put in put them in areas where you feel
insecure about so use in this case

[3:05:47]
insecure about so use in this case
insecurity as a compass to point you in
the direction like hey I'm probably not
a studied in this area maybe this is
what my study work should be focused on
all right I think uh the main takeaway
is for me I want to thank everyone for

[3:06:01]
is for me I want to thank everyone for
tuning in
we're also very curious what your main
takeaways are so like this video
subscribe to the channel leave a comment
down below with your main takeaways we
will pick a winner who will win one
month of GTO wizard between the people

[3:06:17]
month of GTO wizard between the people
who write down the takeaways so make
sure to write it down and get a chance
to get picked want to thank everyone for
tuning in to the Pod again much love I
want to thank Adam for coaching this bus
schedule with me I want to thank Mateos
again for sharing all this wisdom and I

[3:06:32]
again for sharing all this wisdom and I
hope to see you guys in the next podcast
episode
