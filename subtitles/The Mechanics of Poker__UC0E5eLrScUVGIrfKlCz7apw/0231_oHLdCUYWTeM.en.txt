[1:33:59]
take what I feel like is happening at

[1:33:59]
take what I feel like is happening at
the tables and I just throw it in the

the tables and I just throw it in the

[1:34:01]
the tables and I just throw it in the
solver and I start node locking so I

[1:34:04]
solver and I start node locking so I

[1:34:04]
solver and I start node locking so I
have my initial thoughts I have the

[1:34:06]
have my initial thoughts I have the

[1:34:06]
have my initial thoughts I have the
counter strategy to those thoughts and

[1:34:08]
counter strategy to those thoughts and

[1:34:08]
counter strategy to those thoughts and
then I kind of stress test them both and

[1:34:10]
then I kind of stress test them both and

then I kind of stress test them both and
then I go with what I think uh is the

[1:34:13]
then I go with what I think uh is the

[1:34:13]
then I go with what I think uh is the
most realistic to what I can do to win
