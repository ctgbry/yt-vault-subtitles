people really want to win the big pots
and they don't put as much effort into
the smaller ones especially low sticks
and then bleeding in those spots is
because they're not as emotionally
invested because there's not as much
money in the pot so how do we fix it
today we will be chatting with
23-year-old Us online high SE cash game
player Armine amini better known as
absolute top up or real men red hole
online my mindset whenever I sit down at
a table is this money is as good as gone
I set my expectations high but I'm aware
of what can easily happen how do you
deal with the the moment I made a
mistake I'm not quite where I need to be
to change in that to I can learn from
this and move on kind of had this exact
experience while the championship was
going on I bet a hand and got shoved on
on the turn and I made a pretty big full
right after I kind of like just thought
about it and I'm like my thought process
in that hand was just wrong this is a
mistake that like if I want to be in
contention to be the best I can't be
making a mistake like that and that's
something that moving forward I won't
what makes a player like lonus or the
tougher to play against than maybe your
your average opponent feels like he's
always betting so I feel like I always
have to you know have a decision against
him right I don't get to have a street
off sometimes like oh please check but
that he just bets what would you say is
the most important lesson po has taught
you if I work really hard at something
for long enough it's almost like you
know the 10,000 hour rule work at
something hard efficiently like
correctly and stay consistent with it uh
you will get results it's inevitable
that's the number one thing like that's
the the best Habit to have I feel like
is marking any hand you have like a
question about like I I Mark hands that
are less than five big blinds that's
something that I encourage students
friends all the above kind of wanted to
touch on is like you said maybe should I
Network or something that's something
that I wasn't really good with at all if
you're not good at networking be friends
with someone who is all right you say
I'm stoic but physically I don't look
stoic according to my friends like I
look like I'm
tilted thank you guys for tuning in to

Ado guys enjoy this episode Aran I uh
first came across your name railing the
recent cash game World Championship
which for our AUD listening was a cash
game event hosted by coin poker in which
they opened rake free 5100 tables which
attracted the best of the best Belling
it out day in and day out for who would
be Crown the champion of online six Max
no liit hold them cash games big
established names showed up think your
luses David Jones J Sam Barrack munas
Etc but also some new and less
established names that came and play to
make a name for themselves in our
question
uh Arman you describe participating and
in the first few weeks even leading this
event as one of the high points in your
career and while you're no stranger to
battling having played a fair amount
over at uh ACR 5100 against the best of
the best must have been a big step up
for you in this podcast today we will
cover how you got there but first I want
to dive in here what kind of motivated
you to participate in this
event so I guess initially I wasn't
really sure whether I was going to play
or not so I was kind of mulling it over
um you know so I kind of like put one
foot in and I'm like H I might play so I
joined the Discord and without like you
know full intentions of playing I was
like oh I might and then you know I just
like thought it over I like looked at
some uh looked at my results oh in Rec
battling over the years and 5K now like
uh you know 5kc is not all that
different than uh a lot of the lineups
that I played in in the cash game World
Championship maybe it was a a little bit
softer but um you know I I joined
thinking you know I have an edge uh or
some type of Edge and that uh if I just
keep my head on straight uh I might be
able to do
well when when when entering the Discord
and looking at the names were you going
in with like H there's maybe a couple of
guys maybe I'll I'll I'll lean back a
little bit see see I remember in the
beginning for example the first days
lonus was in there like 24/7 I can
imagine that you're like maybe waited
out to see if I can get a better spot
here and there you know that's the
benefit of Living in America you know
the time zones are a bit
different like naturally I didn't have
to play against them as much but he was
on for very long sessions so you know I
still ran into him quite a bit
did you have any uh any expectations or
or goals starting
in um you know I always set my
expectations like very high so you know
I I went in there trying to win and at
least placing very well so uh yeah
that's what I was expecting and I got
close to what I was expecting so I can't
complain too much yeah you actually had
a had a dream start uh didn't you take
us back you were you know you were like
okay I'll just you know see start
playing and see how it goes and then
suddenly two weeks in you're actually
leading leading the damn thing yeah no
it was it was going really well for me I
was running well uh all my marginal
Bluffs were just getting through a lot
of them on the show table so it was kind
of like a highlight reel for a little
bit so I was having a great time and I
was like yeah I felt like on top of the
world essentially so uh you know very
exciting very entertaining dope I me
levels were very
high you mentioned already the show
tables how was that like at an element
did you did did you f yeah how how did
you experience that well it didn't
really change the way I played I just
played the same but getting it through
and showing it was it was a bit little a
bit little bit of a different feeling
it's it's just like oh I just got that
bluff through and it was pretty sick I
just World starred that guys like what's
going on in my head so
yeah I definitely got excited whenever
uh I got a tank fold on a show
table yeah people people railing uh for
the people railing and people commenting
it was definitely great to have to have
these show tables um I can also imagine
that it's a bit easier I guess to get
result oriented let's say you make a
fault or especially when you make a
fault and the guy shows a bluff you know
the [ __ ] should have really have folded
uh depends on the hand that's being
showed right if the hand's pretty out
lie you're like [ __ ]
uh did did did you ever have like a uh
maybe a little bit of level in your head
like oh I've been showing all this
Bluffs or did that any anytime crush
your
mind I don't think so maybe just a
little bit I mean there was like hands
where I'm like oh I think I made a
mistake yeah but uh I think there was
one big one other than that like the
rest of them could have gone either way
so I I don't beat myself too much uh too
too hard on some of the folds I made or
some of the
calls then actually on uh you said you
know dop me was high but then I believe
it was day 15 uh the game humbles you
and sent you down to fifth I believe
after having 110k losing session oh yeah
I've had uh I had some really bad
sessions I think for like a week
straight I had sessions where I got on I
instantly lost five bance
and I slowly lose a few more after that
so I think there was at least three
sessions where I got on and I lost like
80 to 90k in the first two three hours
and then uh the one you mentioned I
didn't really climb out of but the ones
after had pretty much the same exact
start as that one and then I just played
like eight hours and then clawed my way
back to even or like down 10 or up 10
something negligible so it was like a
bit of a grind in the
middle how did does how does that like
affect your your mental game and your
confidence going in because you know
obviously if you have quotequote your
normal grind you know the swings are
normal you know it's part of it but I
can't imagine that there might be
obviously you know your confident going
in I think everyone that participated is
confident about the game thinks they
have an match but I can imagine that if
you go a big Downer you know and you
look at the tables and they're basically
all established names did any doubt
creep in at some point when when when
you went on a big down swing like oh oh
[ __ ] man not really I kind of just went
into it thinking you know it's very very
likely or possible that I just lose 20
binds or 30 binds and I'm in the hole so
like when my mindset whenever I sit down
on a table is this money is as good as
gone so I you go in there with uh well I
said my I set my expectations high but
I'm aware of what can easily happen yeah
but you
try you try to focus on the good things
that can happen instead of the bad
things that can happen but you already
accepted that if worst case scenario
happens it's okay yeah it's like I mean
it happens we can either do it's
poker looking back at the event how do
you feel about it overall any any any
takeaways uh honestly I kind of just
learned that I'm still maturing as a
poker player so what me to uh what what
evidence what evidence Point pointed out
uh you know just bar ins hitting you
like you know your play isn't always
going to be your your best so like I try
to play my best every time I think I do
a pretty good job of it but you know
when sessions get hard and you know it
feels like there's a lot of pressure on
you because you keep on just losing pots
you're always in like a losing position
it feels like for stretches uh trying
not to unravel during those stretches is
you know it's not as easy
as uh you might initially think right so
uh I I don't think it's easy at all so
no definitely not any any any any any
kind of habits that you have that you go
back to to make sure you know you stay
sane um you
know sometimes I wouldn't play as long
of sessions so I just like end my
session and uh try not to overdo it
right you know live to fight another day
um that's kind of like my go-to don't
try too hard uh to just get out of the
hole because you know that's one thing
that I've probably done in the past a
lot and honestly that's something I for
stretches in the challenge is something
I was doing you know I like mentioned I
was playing eight hour sessions trying
to get out of the hole me saying this is
like the exact opposite of what I'm
preaching so what are like signs that
you're trying too much what what like
when do you know like o I mean it's time
it's maybe time to just quit perhaps
doing stuff that's just super marginal a
bit more than I should like you know
it's a low frequency play but uh I want
to do it this time because if it works
I'm even yeah I I I definitely relate to
this one I'm sure sure a lot of the
audience can relate to this one uh yeah
mean you you it's when you're down you
know you just look up the variance a
little bit a a little bit more you try
to increase the variance and get unstuck
but
as of like late I've done a pretty good
job of you know uh staying in staying
keeping my head on straight staying in
line uh understanding that I can't win
every pot and some I just have to
concede
sometimes and it's the hardest to do
that whenever you're uh on a down
swing
sure you know like obviously it's called
the world the world championship right
then we're going to Crown a winner he's
going to be the champion uh how much do
the result of this challenge indicate
who is currently the best at six Max in
your opinion so basically I'm asking is
Owen indeed the goat right yes I think
it leads you in the right direction
right so it gives you a good idea of
what's going on you know there's always
going to be variant but I think you know
there's reasonable uh confidence in uh
you know these players played a lot of
hands on the top so uh although there's
variant um it gives you an idea of like
okay this player is doing pretty well I
mean there was players in the challenge
that did very poorly but I think they're
really good players and you know I saw a
lot of the showdowns and a lot of them
were show tables too so I'm like oh this
guy is running terrible so uh maybe the
results don't indicate how bad he's
doing you know or like how good he is
yeah because if if if we purely based
off result right I think the botom three
top of my head C Lama I think ended last
then you had T doer and jasm Gil which
you know all three if you if you before
each other who would be in top 10 I
would have probably put them in the top
10 so yeah no um some of them definitely
ran
bad I was I was on the opposite end of
some of the some of their uh down
swings it's it's I mean it's it's really
hard to do in my opinion and that's just
part of part of Poker right and kind of
dealing with that on the long term kind
of shows who's going to be the best so I
guess while obviously it's great and it
will give some sort of indication it's
also really like form of this moment for
example also how important do you feel
it is especially for maybe less
established guys who join the challenge
to in the beginning you know have things
at least not go or to to in the
beginning have things go their way a
little bit I can imagine that you know
some people in the beginning are just
like okay I'm going to try it out a
couple sessions see how it goes and if
you straight away get beat at 50 B
you're like okay maybe I'm out how
important do you think it is to in the
beginning you know catch catch at least
some heat um well if you're on the fence
definitely important see I was I was
kind of on the fence right so if I ran
bad I might have ended up stopping I
might have not ended up playing as much
as I did so you know I ran I was
fortunate to run good in the beginning
who uh beside beside owens's stood out
to you in terms of uh giving you a
giving you a tough
time a tough
time well that was the first time I put
in decent volume versus and uh pretty EX
austing playing him for several hours
I'd say he was very tough to play
against what what what makes or or maybe
we can also make it a bit more General
right what makes what makes a person a
player like lonus or someone at the top
tougher to play against the maybe your
your average opponent just feels like
he's always
betting so I feel like I always have to
you know have a decision against him
right I don't get to have a street off
sometimes like oh please check but no he
just bets
so so you you're always so basically
it's aggression what you're saying oh
yeah the more aggressive the more
exhausting because the more you have to
think true and especially obviously but
what sometimes it can also just be over
the top the other way right where it's
just like well you know this guy is just
out of line but he he does seem to
balance it or not not necessarily he
keeps you it keeps you guessing yeah for
some for some reason he's always betting
but he's somehow always in line
it's always always reasonable that's
when you know someone someone that's
when you know it's it's getting
difficult yeah it's it's like uh yeah
probably like range construction on a
whole another level and and I'm thinking
about runouts and board Textures in a in
a in a in a different way uh you
definitely don't shy away from comp
competition right that's why he also
joins a tallent have you always been
this competitive even maybe prior to
Poker
prior to
Poker I mean yes I've been competitive
but to this level maybe
not I would say
uh when I played uh games like you know
Call of Duty basketball soccer I was
very competitive but I ended up like
dropping those things after a few years
or you know after a while like I I
outgrew it or something like that but
poker I pretty much stuck to it you know
there's been times where I've like
fallen in and out of love with the game
but right now I'm you know very much uh
passionate about it again so uh yeah I'm
I'm very competitive what is it about
poker that uh kept you interesting
compared to like the other games you
just
mentioned probably like the idea that
you know it's definitely possible to be
at the top I think it's definitely very
because like basketball I mean I'm I'm
not very tall so that got you know cut
off in high school essentially when I
stopped growing towards the end of high
school and uh
soccer uh I pretty much played like
seven eight years maybe a little more
but I pretty much cut it off when I
started going to middle school and high
school and dur the Call of Duty I guess
it's a bit more accessible regardless of
your height or your physical capab
I'd say I was more more competitive at
that than I was at the other things so
you would say actually poker is or at
least success in poker is more
attainable than for example success in
sports yeah I would say
so you mentioned that you know you go to
phases where you fall in love or out of
love with poker what do you do when you
fall out of love with poker to to get
back into to get to get that fire going
again
man that's a that's a tough question
uh I would say for me um you know having
those results to go along with it
definitely help so in the beginning just
constantly uh leveling up in a sense
like you know I'm started at nl10 now
I'm at nl25 so like getting that jump
get gives you know great motivation to
keep on going
so essentially when you start hitting
plateaus um it kind of you lose that
feeling of moving up and it kind of
forces you away from the game so you
kind of need to keep on setting new like
stepping stones to like kind of keep on
going up so I'd say I kind of fell out
of I fell out of love with the game
probably at somewhere somewhere around
mid
2023 I'd say and that is essentially
when I broke routine so that meant you
know studying I I was studying very
often I was marking 30 to 40 hands a
session not reviewing all of them but
reviewing most of them and you know uh
working really hard and then when I fell
out of love with the game I just stopped
studying it like completely right so
took a while to kind of reignite that uh
um flame I guess I
uh for I said like around a little over
a year I didn't study at all and you
know what kind of I kind of coasted
right like I was like okay I'm I'm doing
well uh I'm winning but I don't think I
really care to get better right now so I
just played for a while uh I'd play Mass
tables like 10 tables at a time just
autopilot and uh get off without
studying so that that was that's what I
was doing for a while and to get out of
that you know I kind of just decided I I
need to get my [ __ ]
together uh I started studying again
about uh in
October what made you care
again uh kind of just like sitting there
being like you know I'm satisfied with
what's going on but I could do so much
better I'm like kind of like letting
myself down
so I'm like all right enough of this you
know silliness I gotta I got to start
working hard again where were you also
like frustrated with like the play that
you were showing you know you were
capable of more yeah a little bit I I
think so I think that was a part of it
like yeah like I'm sitting here I'm
doing okay I'm doing good
but for me I I could do I could do
better is I I always set my expectations
high and I kind of lost sight of that
for a while so you know trying to get
back on the horse me that was in in
October so I guess then hearing about
hearing about the challenge came in a
came in a right in a good time I guess
uh yeah so it was really convenient
because I started cutting down my tables
now I only play like six tables maximum
and uh
studying uh as much as I can you know as
much as I can Toler it because I was
really passionate about studying few
years ago because there's a lot more to
learn and you know there's still a lot
to learn but it's much more obscure than
before
so now you know I study and try to take
away what I can but I've started doing
that in October and then the results
were coming back really well I think I
had pretty big upswing since the start
of October on whatever whatever I
basically
played and then about a week week and a
half before the challenge uh llama's
like hey uh we're Gathering all these
high stakes players are you interested
and I'm like uh maybe and then he
invited me to the group
H what did you because sometimes when
you go through a stretch where or at
least sounds like where you were playing
like your C game B game it actually is
also a good opportunity that it shows
like the parts of your game that you can
actually still improve in what did you
learn During the period of you know
slacking off a little bit autop piloting
what did you learn about about your game
that now has significantly
improved so basically I kind of did like
a mini database analysis of just my
recent results I'm like oh these stats
are not what I want them to be and you
know like maybe I'd like front front Ro
front load my aggression because yeah
I'm playing 10 tables I'm not thinking
too too indepthly about a hand so maybe
like you know more protecting you know
maybe more check
raising more yeah I can defin I can
definitely see with with with with the
protecting and and check yeah I I can I
can exactly understand what you mean
actually I saw I think um video the
other day of I think it was Phil gelfant
that said also along the C of lazy or I
think he called it power that was like a
reminder for himself that he play poker
power and what he kind of meant with
that is also like indeed like the lazy
bats he called them lazy protection BS
like a just to prevent another street
from happening and then you have to
think you know it's like uh so I can
definitely relate also interesting what
you said that in the period before you
were marking 30 40 hands not that
necessary to review them all but it at
least shows that when you're playing
that you're curious right because
something triggered that oh interesting
I Mark oh interesting I Mark and I I
personally find poker the most
fulfilling when you're indeed striving
for a bigger goal because they are like
oh wait you know let let's say this
catch Game World Championship I'm trying
to beat this guys how can I beat this
guys and then your mind goes into all
type of you know tries to find Solutions
you become curious again and that's when
poker becomes most enjoyable and it
sounds like that's really the same for
you yeah
% so what are your uh what are your
goals
now I not not to break routine that's
for sure I got to keep on keep on
studying because uh you know playing the
cash game World
Championship uh I said I kind of learned
a few things about my game uh more
things I could work on so I kind of did
like a self- review after the after and
during so I kind of have a good idea of
what I want to work on
yeah I can also imagine if you jump in
against the best of the best the
weakness of your game will definitely
you know come come tested a lot of a lot
more often so you know when you're
tested a lot more often you know there's
there's holes that uh come come
along did you know that maybe uh I can
imagine that after after a championship
like that if you then go back to the
quote quote normal grind it's easy
that's guess also what you're what
you're pointing out with like listen I
got to stay take stay on top of my
routines because I can imagine it can be
you said you know dopamine was you know
every day you have a really a necessity
right to show up in your best form
because you're playing at this
level like did did you notice a little
dip off when you know go back to like
your normal games it's like oh yeah
definitely a bit less
engaging got to round with the boys
again round two yeah yeah I uh I need to
I guess find uh that fire again because
you know after the challenge uh I
haven't played as
much yeah I can so so how would you how
would you try to refine that the fire
going forward I guess I guess it's easy
because like in the in the championship
the challenge comes
from uh from the
opposition but I guess you know if the
opposition doesn't challenge you how
then how can you find that challenge
within yourself Hing high stakes
runs cuz you know playing high stakes
the go the end goal is to make money
right well no I guess to make money and
to be the best player you can be but
money is a good part of it so I really
like high stakes to run but you know it
doesn't run too often you know to be
fair probably all the guys in the
challenge now kind of fud his way so I I
you know I don't have to battle all the
time right just give me give me a little
bit of a
break CU game selection's never been my
strong suit I've always pretty much
battled you think that contributed a lot
to I mean you you you Rose up very fast
uh right I think like only within a
couple years you're already playing high
stakes you think not shying away from
tough opponents helped who contributed a
lot of dep yeah know I had to because
like I said like when you're playing
tougher opponents you're constantly
getting tested so uh that definitely
helped me cuz marking you know 30 40
hands a session uh and getting tested
together definitely increased the speed
in which I got to where I
am you mentioned already earlier that uh
uh you played uh you played soccer
basketball and Call of Duty from from I
think what you told me uh prior to
starting the recording through Call of
Duty is where you got into touch with
poker
correct yeah without Call of Duty I
would have never played
poke how how how how how were those two
linked
so uh I played Call of Duty with the
this guy uh his name is uh his username
is Trico blast he mainly plays po at
Omaha now on uh American sites but uh we
played Call of Duty together we would
like play for like you know 5 10 $25 at
a time play these tournaments against
other players and you know not making
much money but you know enjoying
ourselves and uh eventually like he um
started playing poker professionally and
uh uh he kind of introduced it to me and
uh I was like oh this is pretty fun like
I he knew I like watched the high stakes
poker uh those uh Ivy dwan all those
guys playing and you know I enjoyed
those we talk about that occasionally
and then eventually he started showing
me that he was playing poker and that he
was doing pretty well he was a he was
playing like uh he was dabbling into
like 3K 5kc uh at points but you know
game selecting good
lineups what were your uh expectations
and goals going in I guess you just
started to play a little bit more poker
he definitely gave you Insight in terms
oh wow there's there's definitely money
in this was that one of your motivators
or it was just purely like because I
thought it was fun I didn't really think
of it as like you know a profitable
thing at the end of the day like may I
was like maybe I could win some money
but I didn't really think of it like as
a job or anything I was in school that
was like my main focus but I do it
because it was fun
I
believe how long did it take you for for
poker to take up more time than your
studies uh not long honestly like my
because of covid uh I basically got into
poker a little bit after Co started uh
so we were basically on lockdown uh I
had my first year of college online and
honestly that might have been the reason
because a lot of my my classes were
online so I would just show up to class
class would be over and then I'm already
on my computer so I hopped on poker and
because of co uh this was uh when I was
playing like I guess 50
NL I would play like eight hours a day
and uh that was really helpful to
getting
better where did you uh like go for
information did your friend help you out
in terms of getting started strategies
how did you first come across like
strategies that you were implementing or
you were just winging it or you had some
prey
experience this is a good one so uh he
gave me like a 100 bucks said I'll stake
you you can so you can play poker so
without that I don't think I actually
would have played I don't think I would
I didn't have money I was uh my parents
had money but I didn't have
anything I just had a computer so uh he
St me and then uh I'd send them hands
that I had questions about and we kind
of discussed them and he uh is notorious
for of never using a solver
so we would kind of just brain solve
stuff together and he I I would ask him
questions because I I barely knew what a
CET was uh so he would basically tell me
everything he knew and tried to guide me
in the right
direction recall something that really
stood out to you that was like a really
big big deal for you in terms of how you
were approaching poker
then uh honestly I was very unorganized
back then so I would say no I would just
say okay I'm not winning right now but I
know I can and that that was really it
and he'd be telling me like oh you're
you're on the right track your thought
process is going like it's improving and
like I know you can do it so he was he
was a big believer in me and that kind
of drove me a bit like him like saying
you know I think you he when I was
playing 50 and Ellie said I think you
can be better than me and I'm like oh
really and that kind of like was like
okay that was that was like encouraging
that motivated me a bit more like oh I
can get better I have room to improve
hm so basically what you're saying is
you didn't go to like I mean there's
nowadays there's so much training
material out there coaching available
but you just discuss some hands with him
and other than that you were really I
guess you were really engaged while
playing in terms of really trying to
figure it is out yeah I mean I I didn't
really have outside knowledge other than
the thoughts going inside my head and
the thoughts that he would kind of give
me so it was all pretty much brain
solver for a long time I honestly I
don't even think I knew what a solver
was back then I didn't even know they
were a
thing I saw a a post on your Twitter AKA
X I guess I should say nowadays A posted
I think it was the summer of 2021 where
he said 200 Blitz which two months later
was corrected by 500L zone is where boys
turn into
men what changed as air went from a boy
poker player to a man and how did the
the 2 200 L Blitz and later 500 L Zone
grind catalyzed this
change
so hopefully I I think I'll try to
remember this the best I can so uh Trio
back then he was staking me he was like
try to play in games with fish right and
which is a very smart thing to say to
someone who's not very good and who's
trying to learn how to play because
playing in tough games isn't going to
win me money or get me it might get me a
little better but it's definitely like
plateauing me as far as results go so uh
I was never really that good at game
selecting but you know I would try
because he'd uh encourag me to slforce
me to because he was staking me so uh
that was then and I think eventually I
got off stake and just started playing
200 Blitz on my own because I you know
mainly was playing untracked sites and I
wanted to play tracked sites because I
knew uh it was uh getting a graph
getting statistics it's like good for my
Improvement and I think that's
eventually when I started dabbling with
solvers so
then using so then you started using
solare was that due to like facing
tougher opposition in like what was was
it did did those pools kind of raise the
necessity that you're like maybe I
should try to see what's up may like
what was the catalyst to using
solvers I kind of just thought that you
know up to that point not having ever
used a solver I was doing like I think I
was like winning small on like 500 NL on
American
sites and you know that was nice and all
but that's not a very inspiring results
for someone who's trying to become as
good of a poker player as possible and
you know I knew that not using a solver
would really limit my game so uh I kind
of just said all right and I also you
know got to the point where I was
eventually like disagreeing about hands
with my coach right so I was like all
right I'm gonna try this thing try to do
this thing on my own you felt like you
were uh you know at some point the the
student kind of outshines outshines the
master you think you think you you
learned what you what you got and you
were like no I I need I need to surpass
this
level I I didn't think I surpassed the
master at that point but I did think
that if I want to surpass the master I
think I need a different
approach so you opened the you opened
the
solver yeah and I had no idea what I was
doing yeah I was going to say because
but on the other side like from the
outside looking in I mean if you if you
just manag to just with like his his
advice and you just start playing and
you manag to get to that
level I I would I would almost be afraid
that the solver would then destroy your
let's just call it natural talent for
for the game and I've heard many of
these stories right that people are
actually doing well and that kind of
solvers destroyed them in a way because
yeah you it's it's all about a manner of
how to interpretate that information how
was that experience for you uh it kind
of did destroy it in a sense uh well not
I guess did but uh when after I started
using a solver I hit Plateau for months
or you know I even went down a bit and I
wasn't doing as well right so it took a
while it's it's a pretty big learning
curve honestly just opening a solver and
starting to try to apply strategies that
the solver is recommending what did you
stop doing that that was actually making
you win because like I said that that
was my that that would have been my
concern uh I was probably doing a lot
more marginal
stuff lot lot more uh marginal
aggression or uh yeah I think mainly
that honestly like cool solver plays
because it's did it you were intuitiv
intuitively just way more aggressive and
when when you started to look at the
solver you kind of played nice uh I
think I was probably intuitively more
passive because you know uh not using a
solver at all I think I was in like I
was I think I was on the more passive
side uh while moving up and then like
opening up a cver and saying wow this is
way more aggressive than me I have to be
more aggressive that's that's not enough
you know you got to you got to take it
in a more you got to think of it in a
more sophisticated way than just oh I
need to be more
aggressive true but I would say being
aggressive yourself I would say is a if
I look at into a student and he's if
he's at least naturally aggressive you
know I feel like it's easier to work
with that than someone who's naturally
passive but you are also being
aggressive versus aggression so you're
starting to station people not and
looking people up way to light stuff
like that yeah I probably wasn't doing
it correctly right so I was probably to
be I was trying to fight their
aggression with my aggression which
isn't always the best thing to do so
like I kind of said that I kind of
destroyed my game in a sense like yeah I
kind of like tore my game down to build
it back up but you know the tear down
process wasn't very
smooth what made you uh
continue um you
know I wasn't getting the results I
wanted but I got to a point where I like
realized I think I'm getting better even
though I wasn't getting the results so
like maybe it was like 3 months four
months but uh throughout that 4mon
period for the first like two months and
I'm like I'm definitely getting better I
know I'm getting better like I was just
maybe I was delusional but I really
thought I was getting better and that I
was in the right direction I was going
on the going on the right path so uh I
kept on going and then eventually I saw
results what did your coach say like
dude I told you badly s
suck um you know he'd say like some
plays are cool but like some plays are
like go nope I don't think the solver is
right on that one and you know he could
he could be right about some of those
plays like I can't remember uh what
exactly but you know there's there's
definitely times where the solver isn't
the best thing to the solver's action
isn't the best one to take versus you
know who you're playing against
so do you
remember what clicked for you that made
made your game change and your results
go in the right
direction um getting like I guess I got
to the point where I was understanding
concepts and applying them really well
rather than
just having an idea of what I needed to
do right so like a lot of the time it's
not a specific spot but like you kind of
get a spot thrown in front of you in
game and you don't really know what this
does but you have all these like pieces
from the puzzle and you're trying to put
them together like all right there's
this heris stick that kind of works with
this similar type of texture that I
think like you know the equity the hand
strength the uh blockers and unblockers
they kind of like work all work together
to kind of give me an idea of what I
need to do so like all the small things
that I've slowly learned with a solver
through like you know a lot of error
kind of came together and it kind of of
all had uh they were all like getting
together
cohesively was there like one uh you
mentioned the pieces of the puzzle was
there like one critical piece or eristic
that for you was like a big aha moment
like now I get
it um I think the main one is like
understanding how when blockers and
unblockers are
relevant cuz they're not going to be a
lot of the time but uh most of the time
they are
I think I think a lot of the time
blockers and unblockers are the most
important thing in
poker interesting because you hear
really mixed mix advice on this you you
would say that so you would say that in
the beginning you were not enough
blocker and Unblocker oriented and then
when you started to take that a bit more
serious that's for you when things
really started to to to change around or
do you think thinking more in terms of
the properties of your
hand kind of naturally resulted in your
frequencies overall being better was it
more like a guideline for
knowing yeah for for getting closer to
the right
frequencies so like kind kind of tying
back to like the pieces of the puzzle
it's like blockers and unblockers kind
of work together with hand properties a
lot of the time so like yeah I think a
lot of the time your hand properties are
like the number one thing you want to
focus on and then building your range
around those properties and you know
your blockers and unblockers maybe it
depends on suit uh maybe it depends on
what their the other opponent's actual
range looks like kind of influence your
range construction as a whole so while I
might say blockers and
unblockers I think what I really mean is
range construction and I think that
helps me with range construction a lot
of the
time yeah so so you now have pieces so
you now knew how to construct your
ranges that's that's basically what
you're I had all these pieces but really
working together and then eventually I
got them working together so now my
range construction naturally fixed
itself and you started to understand
like why certain hands go where and what
they're and what they're achieving and
yeah then then I and then at some point
also like you don't have to study all
the all all the notes anymore right
because in the end it all comes back to
to kind of the same core
principles yeah I kind of a good way of
putting it is like exploit is like hand
ver range and then solver is like range
versus Range and finding a good balance
between the
two and you know that was probably the
hardest part for me yeah I I was going
to say how long how long did it take you
to to to to get that to work
properly so I said it took like three to
four months to kind of like understand
and like Implement solver strategies
so probably like another three to four
months on top of that you know uh while
like you know while I'm on this upswing
I'm also putting it together so like
maybe I hadn't put it together all the
way maybe I needed some luck to push me
in the right direction but uh during
that stretch I kind of put it together
you were still uh you're still studying
at the time as well on the
side uh during that upswing like during
that uh
2022 or 2023 I don't remember
yeah tirelessly like you know I was
still I think basically since 500 NL to
now even when I like said I fell out of
like you know I fell out of love with
the game I was still marking 30 to 40 20
to 40 30 to 40 hands a session I was
marking so much it's like a habit like
even if I'm not studying him I marking
them so I know what I need to look at
eventually when when for you was like
the turnaround point that you were like
okay [ __ ] College poker because like you
didn't really set out to become a
professional when when when did it
become inevitable that you're like well
I have no other choice to become a
professional
now that's a good one I uh I basically
dragged my feet on that one for a long
time so I was waiting till I had very
good results
so I think I was in the sophomore year
of college or maybe it was towards the
end of sophomore year beginning of
junior year junior year I had a very
very big up swing and I was basically
got to the point where I was shot taking
10K andl and I was like all right I just
had a really good
year I think college is taking up too
much of my time and I think this is way
more productive so I basically decided
that's enough college for
them how did your uh environment respond
to that you know you can get mixed mixed
responses the parents weren't happy
they're very traditional so uh they can
they couldn't say no because of the
results I I gave them results if I
didn't have the results they would have
been pretty upset but uh they uh they
came along they came around to it pretty

but without further Ado let's continue
today's episode with our
mean Adam what in your opinion are some
things that people have to take in
consideration uh before saying College
goodbye and pursuing a career in
poker that's a tough transition moment
for anybody I think if you're quitting
college or studies you need to be pretty
confident that you're going to stick out
it with poker because you're going into
a kind of linear Direction and if you
say no the studies and all the
opportunities that come that way you're
kind of making a big bet on yourself and
you got to realize you're in for a a
rude awakening let's call it in terms of
the reality of being a poker player I
really like the way Al Meine did it
because he uh wait till results got to a
certain point it's like I have
undeniable evidence that this is going
to be a good opportunity let's go for it
so yeah I think if you're unsure you're
still going through a transition phase
maybe playing it safe and kind of
combining the two studies with poker
build some evidence with yourself that
you've got confidence in it and then to
be honest you probably just need to
trial poker for a period of time to see
if the full-time lifestyle is for you I
know myself I love playing poker with
friends and then when we finished
University to my friends were like
should we go to Thailand and get a grind
house for 3 months and the three months
was an experiment either we love doing
this fulltime or like get back to the
real world I want some structure I want
to do my own thing so it's really hard
to know until you try that like a full
immersive experience and just go in
there with an open mind so yeah a lot of
things to consider but I would play with
caution and get to a point where you
feel like you uh it's worth dropping out
because dropping out of studies then
re-engage them with studies is not going
to be an easy move a lot of play people
will want to finish their studies before
they trans position um but yeah it's
definitely a a personal thing to think
through all right you guys covered so
many topics there and you you covered
out the journey and I was really curious
to know when you got to 500 Zone I know
it sounds from this the journey there's
a lots of rebuilding during this phase
and trial and era of figuring out how to
beat those games solvers came to the
front for the first time and you're
rebalancing a lot of things strategy
wise you also lost half your bankroll
during this phase as well which is a
really brutal thing to experience from a
mindset perspective so I'd like to take
us back to that moment and how you
handled that that big swing of losing
half your bank
roll I think I was I was pretty upset
and you know that kind of nudged me into
being more conservative as a whole with
bankr management and you know having
more than you know 40 bans that when I
shot take a stake so I make sure I have
like you know 60 to 70 when I'm shot
taking and that honestly probably
influenced why it took me so long
to uh leave College because you know
losing half of what you have is not
sustainable if uh I want to leave
college for to become a player full-time
so uh yeah I ended up being much more
conservative with uh how I wanted to
rise up the
stakes so yeah that was that was a big
influencer in how I approached uh poker
as a career
how did you experience that downswing
did it lead to any self-doubt it sounds
like you're generally someone who backs
themsel has a lot of confidence did that
moment in time create a little bit of a
reflective moment or a bit of doubt in
yourself oh yeah absolutely I was like
I'm not I might not be cut out for this
I don't think I might not be able to be
that good at poker because you know I've
been working really hard but I'm not
really figuring it out I'm still making
like you know I'd review my hands and
I'm like yo this is this is pretty
terrible uh I'm just punting and I'm not
sure how to turn this like turn this
situation into like a winning
one how did you use that self-doubt in a
constructive way I know self-doubt is
one of those feelings we all go through
and I always find it interesting how
certain people deal with that some
people kind of wallow in it a little bit
and let it kind of steep and it kind of
builds other people hate that feeling so
much it almost drives them to learn to
study to improve so when you were
feeling that self-doubt how was is that
impacting you dayto
day so it definitely motivated me to
keep on working but I kind of like went
into it thinking like I I might not be
able to figure this out like I'm kind of
hitting a
plateau uh I'm not sure whether I can
figure out if I can get better and like
you know that's when like you maybe I'm
maybe I should look into like other ways
of learning other than you know just
trying to figure it out myself because
you know that's essentially like what I
wanted to do is all right you know one
of my friends recommended why don't you
try to go get private coaching from
somebody you know and I'm like uh I
think I I'm just going to keep on trying
myself which honestly now like being a
coach in a cfp and hearing that like I'm
like oh like this player this person can
help themselves out a lot by opening
themselves up to other people's opinions
so maybe that was a leak back in the
day you think that was Eagle trying to
figure out everything out yourself yes
100%
you know you could always use some help
bounce ideas off of people get different
opinions you know you're not always
going to be
right yeah obviously you're a smart guy
and it you will be able to solve a lot
of your problems and it's sometimes
trying to figure out when inputs could
help you in that process and not trying
to to get a go through it alone always
and for you did you have a plan B at
this phase when you're going through
this downswing did any thoughts crop
into your mind of returning to your
studies or normal life
yeah no I thought that you know maybe I
should just focus on school but I you
know whenever I would win in poker I
enjoyed it so much that I kind of didn't
let myself get away from it and you know
I just kept on trying and then it
eventually worked out for me so you said
you learned lessons About bankr
Management during this period what other
lessons did you learn about
yourself that um maybe my mental game
isn't as strong as I thought it was but
but uh I've never like I get asked
mental game questions from students and
I tell them I'm not the one to
ask because whenever I'm not feeling
great I just still play for the most
part I don't take very big breaks uh I
think the biggest break I took was like
two
weeks uh during a stretch at like 200 NL
and then I just been
playing almost non-stop
since you say you know not the one to
ask but you're the exact person to ask
because you're able to feel what other
people feel but override it so you're
able to uh practically apply a strong
mindset even when you don't particularly
feel strong which I think's much more
beneficial than talking about Theory so
for you when you make yourself keep
playing during bad patches maybe
sometimes we can talk about the downside
of that how do you get yourself to keep
showing up what's the kind of inner
dialogue that you use to make yourself
be there um I maybe
delusion I I just keep on playing
thinking I I could win I I I see what's
happening but I can figure this out no
more mistakes I just keep on playing
maybe I'm a little tilted but let's keep
on going uh I'm one like at least I like
to think maybe I'm delusional but you
know when I'm tilted if I'm tilted it
doesn't hurt my play that much to drop
me from like an a to like a c maybe it's
like an a to a B minus
which hopefully you know I can keep on
playing and that's what I've just been
doing and I guess that's what works for
me is like you know uh I guess one
problem I had was not cutting off my
sessions when they're going long it's
not going well I'm definitely frustrated
and
agitated uh you know I uh had a friend
stay with me for like a month and uh he
would occasionally walk in my room and
I'm having this bad session I'm just
pacing like my I'm rocking back and
forth in my chair like just frustrated
out of my mind and he's just sitting
there walking in just laughing like are
you good and I'm like uh no and then I
just keep on
playing so there's no quitting you for
sure we can see yeah usually no a lot of
resilience and yeah it's like all
character traits there's a positive side
of them and there's a lot of positives
from yours but there's also a side where
can get detrimental and almost like a
bit of self-sabotaging so for you I want
to know when you are playing your b game
there going to be minus you mentioned
you don't have as big of a drop off how
are you experiencing playing compared to
when you're in a more calm State of Mind
what's this kind of B minus game what's
the experience of your be minus game as
you're living it and playing it uh I'm
definitely less emotional I try not to
be but you know it's almost impossible
to not just be stoic the whole time you
know I try my best to be stoic but
there's going to be sessions where you
know the emotions creep in but when like
you said uh everything's going like fine
and I'm head it uh you know each
decision just becomes its own and
doesn't get doesn't get affected by
previous ones so which is uh well in
non-information Wise like I'm speaking
emotionally I
guess yeah I think when we get emotional
we start keeping a story in our heads
events start linking together things
start getting personal things start
create a bit of meaning that maybe
wasn't there and we lose a little bit of
that that abstract thinking of what's
going on here so when you are feeling
these emotions how does do that
generally affect your game does it lead
you to six spots like more aggressive
spots as you mentioned terrenum bit more
higher variance when you're trying to
get the whole how do those that that
patch of your career how did those
emotions affect your
game it's interesting uh it's actually
like changed as my career has gone on I
think originally it was like I'd uh turn
into like more of a passive and I'd
bleed but you know now it's not so clear
that right so now like I could have
passive stretch
and now like I could just have
overaggressive stretches where I'm
hunting a bit but uh yeah it's not it's
like now it's like a mix now it's not
just passive like because I think
originally I kind of like approached
poker passively and you know
learning uh different ways of being
aggressive kind of honing in on having a
well- constructed aggressive strategy
because being aggressive is the number
one thing in poker
so um yeah it's a more balanced but you
know doesn't necessarily mean it's
perfect yeah so when you say you don't
have a strong mindset where do you feel
like you've got weaknesses there is it
this maybe inability to stop yourself
playing that kind of compulsive I need
to keep going or where do you feel like
you've got weakness in that bman I don't
think I fight live to fight another day
as much as I
should and I I I think like there's
points where I'm like all right I I
don't have to play anymore today I I
should just cut it off and you know I've
done it I've done it more than I have in
the past but I still think that's a
weakness I think a lot of my leaks
actually are
um I guess what's the way of putting it
like staying like clean in game right or
like not losing focus I think for a long
I mean if you ask people who know me a
long time for a long time I just
wouldn't read the board correctly I'd
miss a four line to a straight
so that that was actually a big problem
M you know I've still made that mistake
I think I probably made that mistake in
the challenge at least once
so yeah you mentioned to Rene in the
challenge one of the things you were
most concerned about is could you keep
your head straight and I guess this
links into that can you kind of stay
balanced live to fight into the de when
you're not thinking that way is it just
based on you want results now you're
very you think quite short term would
you say your lens of think about results
think about performance you get a bit
sucked into the the current
narrative yes well absolutely like I I
start thinking shortterm you know one
thing that actually helps is like
clicking on your graph and then just
doing all dates zooming all the way out
and it kind of calms you down a
bit surprisingly effective that yeah
it's like a perspective skill because we
do zoom in a lot and especially results
they generally get us to zoom in on a
day or a short period of time and that's
zooming out is the exact thing online
needs to do as well I can of zoom out
from the shortterm narrative that we're
living in and go there a bigger picture
all right actually my year looks great
so yeah I think it's a it's a constant
reminder I think some of us naturally
gravitate towards a more short-term lens
of life and some can naturally zoom out
more so yeah you got to kind of figure
out where you're at and kind of find
that corrector so you're not too uh too
narrow focused that to too zoomed out um
this links into what you mentioned about
your enjoyments of poke and you like
leveling up obviously you've progressed
a lot of levels in a short period of
time but you mentioned having new
stepping stores so for you what have
been some stepping stones obviously we
can talk about moving up actual levels
but what are some stepping stones like
shter metrics or things you engage your
mind on which keep you motivated to want
to keep pushing and keep going for that
next
goal well nowadays it's fixing like uh
statistics it's fixing statistical
things like oh I might be lacking in
this area so uh maybe I we go restudy
something CU I've kind of not
necessarily unraveled but I kind of like
my mind's become a bit muddied when it
comes to like this this part of my game
so now it's a bit more like detailed
than before it's like oh it's a bit more
General whenever your leaks are bigger I
guess so like as I play more and more
poker my Leaks get smaller they become
more much more distinct
specific uh so I guess that's what it is
and well that's for improvement I guess
but like as far as goals go like um I
don't really play 20K all that much so
maybe I could play more right so I guess
that's the next stepping stone maybe I
just placed 10th this year in the cash
game World Championship hopefully I do
better than that next time they host it
so and the only way to actually well
there's no way of guaranteeing it but to
throw myself in the right direction you
know got to keep on plugging my
leaks it's interesting because like as
you climb the ladder as you mentions
it's first like the things are quite
broad there's lots of things to fix but
as you get better and better now it's
smaller things and The Details Matter
more and more but you've Al always got
to create something to strive towards
something to push towards I think you
mentioned to Rene that there was a point
where you want to be in your comfort
zone taking things a little bit easy so
what pushes you or what what do you
think allows you to to want to keep
getting better I say that because a lot
of people get comfortable where you get
satisfied with a certain income a
certain level of playing and maybe don't
care too much about the details or not
enough for you it feels like there's
something internally that's just it
needs more it needs those details it
needs that extra level so what do you
think drives that to get you out of
settling for your comfort
zone um I guess it's a bit of ego and
hunger in like kind of like
self-expectation like hey like why are
you just settling for this when you
could do do more like for
2023 I basically just took my foot off
the gas pedal and I was like oh I'm
doing well there's not much else I
really need to do I kind of just forgot
like in the beginning I'm like oh I want
to be the best player in the world and I
kind of just lost sight of that
so that's why why does that matter to
you
um kind of just like proving to myself
that I could stay consistent with
something and keep on going because you
know we we mentioned like three or four
different things we've mentioned soccer
we mentioned basketball we mentioned
Call of Duty these are all things that I
kind of just walked away from or like
just set aside like I lost interest in
and you know uh you're not going to
become the best at anything without uh
when when you set it aside so I even did
that with poker but now I'm back
so I'm happy to keeping to keeping to
keeping on or to keep on working hard I
guess yeah it's almost like life's LED
you to this point where finally you can
put all your effit into something and
see how good you can get maybe
basketball wasn't the fit of soccer and
maybe even Call of Duty as well and now
we've realized there's some depth in
trying to figure out or stick to
something and really go deep and you're
taking this as like the challenge to
maybe H say what you're capable of on a
big level and there's a lot of internal
growth here as well but obviously
there's a lot of external growth that
you're experiencing um you mentioned
with Rene about your high expectations
and even your decision to join the cash
game Challenge and you said you think
you have the edge in that G so for you
where does this confidence come from and
what gives you confidence that you have
Edge even when you're playing against
some of the world's best
players oh well rag battling probably
most of the hands in my database that's
probably it I I rag battled so much so
although you know i' said I said I still
need to mature a bit uh um I just
thought okay uh I've played with a lot
of these players quite a bit I think I
know where my spots are with some of
these players and this is with not even
working for or working hard for the last
year and a half so if I you know like I
said I started studying again in October
I didn't study for over a year my only
study was like coaching student uh here
and there um so I was like okay well if
I can do
this not very well but okay without any
study what can I do if I actually put my
mind to it
so I would I didn't want to sell myself
short I wanted to see what I could do
while trying my
best let's take us into the mindsets of
a r battler because you mentioned you've
right battled a lot of your career and I
feel like players have different styles
of approaching poker different
overwatching um goals a lot of players
will mix some R battles with game
selection some are very uh good at
picking games and they don't battle at
all and someone like yourself kind of
gravitate towards that's play tough
games I'll battle anyone so so that
mindset it's quite a vulnerable mindset
because I say vulnerable it's actually
you've got to be willing to H take some
hits to the face and some beatings how
do you feel like you deal with playing
against good opponents let's talk about
maybe early in your career now you're a
bit more established what gravitated you
towards wanting to play tough opponents
why did you not pick easier games uh
just getting better was the number one
thing and just kind of proving to myself
and them that I could beat them which is
like the the big thing right so I guess
that kind of ties into ego but you know
nowadays like I kind of come to realize
like okay this is pretty mentally
exhausting like rag battling every day
or most the days you get on so wow uh
maybe in the past I would just
mindlessly do it I think now like you
know sometimes I give my mind a break
and play with fish because you know
that's probably the most profitable
thing that's definitely the most
profitable thing to do and uh it's
probably like good on your mind to like
kind of give yourself some breathing
room right cuz when you're R battling
all the time it's just you're kind of in
the ringer and you got to don't give
yourself a chance to
breathe yes so it seems like the
overarching goal was always to be the
best you can be and you realized playing
good opponents was going to speed up
that trajectory now you're trying to
find a sweet spot of giving your mind a
break sometimes and not always right
battl in but it does sound like it's
been a big driver of your fast progress
through the stakes so when you play a
tough lineup let's say you're trying to
prove yourself and you've got a bit of a
chip on your shoulder to show you can do
this and you have some losing patches
maybe it's a losing session maybe it's a
losing week to a particular lineup how
does that affect you because I can see
you can play like yourself might wrestle
with this kind bit of self-doubt a bit
of insecurity in those moments and I'm
curious to know how that impacts what
you do next so how do you generally deal
with bad patches during these R
battles well you know I've had help
right so uh coming up in poker I've done
it with my friends so I had this group
of friends from Call of Duty like six
seven of us and now all of us are poker
players right all of us play poker and
they I pretty much Rose up the stakes
being in calls with them just shooting
the [ __ ] like having fun like I'd be
playing six tables of 2K andl and then
they'd all be debating some random
obscure topic into my ear as loud as
they can and I would just play I played
in Call of most of my poker career and a
lot honestly the last like 3 months I
find like was like okay if I'm trying my
best I'm going to play in silence or I'm
not going to play with people like
yelling in my ear or like talking in my
ear distracting me
so um that's a part of my like now new
like matur approach but that honestly
helped me with down spings in the past
in rough batches because you know they'd
be like you know I'd show them hands
we'd look at hands I get I get more than
just my opinion which was probably what
I was doing in the beginning so you know
now like all right they're like this is
very clearly variant like what can you
do or like okay you made this mistake
like and then I take their opinions uh
uh I value their
opinions and you know I bounce it off I
bounce their ideas off with mine and try
to like uh get to the best uh result or
best uh decision with what I want to do
next as far as like uh in-game strategy
goes was getting inputs from those
around you to balance your own thoughts
so you don't get too in your head when
you're losing sounds like a good
approach yeah from the emotional side
how do you experience emotions during
these tough
patches um self-doubt definitely creeps
up
but um I have great friends and you know
they uh they uh are very they help me
with selfish like reassurance uh
whenever I need it and uh you know if I
don't need it let's say your ego is
getting a bit to you and they let me
know so they keep me in check I'd say
but a lot of the time they're very uh
they are very nice when it comes to it
they don't they don't check me too often
but maybe that's because I'm just
getting
better yeah maybe too good to uh to call
out now hey you mentioned um you you
always keep yourself going you always
push through things so it sounds like
whatever emotions you experience they
never leave you kind of stuck they never
leave you in this kind of disappointed
low energy feeling sorry for your self
state it feels like the emotions you
experience maybe the self-doubt just
drives more of a proactive approach
because I feel like for downswings
people go in one or two directions
either derail negatively or they go
right I don't like this down swing I'm
going to do something proactively sounds
like for you you Ste proactively is that
is that correct
yeah I mean I think I've gotten a lot
better at it selft out doesn't really
creep up anymore like we've kind of
gotone to the point where okay we're
somewhat established we have results um
and these these swings are going to
happen no matter what so I think now I'm
as good as I'll as good as I've been as
far as My Computer Career goes and I
guess that's just kind of how it works
like the more experience you get the
usually the better you will be up at
handling these things so
uh now I'm much better than before as
far as uh self-doubt mental game and
everything like I probably had my worst
session a few weeks ago and I'm a good
experience awesome so you mentioned
Focus earlier as well how you've kind of
come from an environment in Call of Duty
where there's people speaking around you
and create lot of noise and you
mentioned like sometimes you struggle
with Focus ear in your career how do you
stay focused now during long sessions
I'm guessing during this challenge
there's some Marathon sessions you
played how do you keep Focus high and
distractions low during long grinds um
honestly the big thing is just uh
sitting down only focusing on poker and
not playing too many tables that's
really it uh I don't think there's
anything special about it um I just try
to make sure like I think in the past
maybe I'd run a YouTube video on the
background and just watch something
while I play that's that's a big no you
know watching Netflix on the side
another big now uh stuff that I don't
really recommend doing
anymore just singular focus seems like
poker's got enough stimulus for you to
get that mind in a very uh High focused
state do you have any distractions or do
you have any kind of lapses in Focus
where you feel like your brains
malfunction a little bit a bit of brain
fog and if you do how do you generally
address that during
sessions I probably don't do a good job
of it you know I'm going to have lapses
no matter what like uh there's going to
be something related to like I I've been
a big fan of MMA the last few years
something pops up now I'm interested
YouTube
video stuff like that and how do I do to
what do I do to like stop that honestly
this is part of like maybe I'm not a
good mental coach I don't I just do it
anyways but I try my best not
to yeah I'm guessing they becoming less
frequent as you're getting to a higher
level yeah like I'm not opening up
Twitter on the side not opening up
social medias or YouTube I'm just like
okay this is my poker tracker and then
my tables that's
it yeah yeah I think it's good good to
be realistic as well like you're human
there's things that attract your
attention we're not just robots who can
just singular focus on one thing for 10
hours straight without a thought popping
into our mind so we've got to try to
work with that limitation but also over
time as you have like Trend towards less
distractions Trend towards more focus
and yeah less kind of ideas pop in your
head that you engage in I feel like fcus
has been one of my bigger leaks
throughout my career so would you say
it's still a leak or do you feel like
you've mainly addressed that it's less
of a
leak it's Min you're working on there to
make it even less of leak again or do
you feel like yeah anything you do maybe
like a child lock on Google
Chrome something like that you can do
apps like uh Freedom where you be
basically go on your browser and chrome
and you type the hours that you wanted
to be locked offline for and it
basically won't let you go on during
certain hours yeah it's interesting when
we like we're in such a world of
stimulation and things that want our
attention things that we're curious
about we often need be quite mindful of
Designing our environments and create a
few like of safe locks around what do I
kind of gravitate towards can I just
block that during these kind of hours so
I can focus to make it easy for myself
it's the same with like Diet a lot of
people have fridges or cupboards full of
unhealthy snacks it's like okay you
already lost the game because when
you're hungry you're going to open the
fridge you lose so it's like trying to
create your environment around the goals
you're trying to achieve and yeah
there's often some things you can you
can do there I want to talk about
dealing with financial swings because I
think your story is very interested in
this regard you mentioned when you first
started you didn't even have $100 and
the only reason you did start is because
your friend give you $100 now you're
losing $100,000 in a session and we're
probably what three four years apart so
for you how do you on a mental level
deal with losing such vast amounts of
money are you not attached to the money
do you see it as buyings yeah just talk
us for like how you're kind of
interpreting the swings that you're
experiencing I just assume that I want
it back eventually so I just know it's
gone but it can't be gone for that long
if I'll If I Stay disciplined so it
sucks like while it happens but honestly
my biggest losing days have not even
been the most frustrating
usually the biggest losing days happen
very
quickly so uh yeah I I think I
lost I don't know how recent it was but
I think I lost like 880,000
uh in like 30 minutes and then I was
like well that happened quickly and I
just lost them in the most standard in
the most standard way possible I'm like
well couldn't do anything uh see you
tomorrow was basically what I said to
myself so yeah all of these things
you're noing are really strong mindsets
in terms of ways of outlooks of looking
at stuff you mentioned not not worried
about losing because you'll get it back
eventually that's awesome because now
you're not you're not bothered about a
shortterm swing and it sounds like for
you and things are out of your control
you don't take too much attention to it
I'm guessing you're probably a little
bit harder on yourself when you're
making mistakes than you are when just
losing through variance yeah I I would
agree that's that's how I am you
mentioned you tag a lot of hands does
that help you to you feel like you're
working on your mistakes in game yeah no
that's that's the number one thing like
that's the best Habit to have I feel
like is marking any hand you have like a
question about or like I Mark hands like
my exact hand I might have played
correctly like I might I might know that
this is I'm playing this hand correctly
but uh there's questions about my range
about flop turn a river and then I mark
it like something as small as that I
mean if the checks down to the river
like I I mark hands that are less than
five big blinds or like six big blinds
so that's something that I encourage uh
uh students friends all the above I
encourage it to everyone like if you
have any small uh part of a hand that
you are suspicious about Mark
it is this something you consciously do
or is just curiosity so high that you
naturally do this I do it unconsciously
like it's just a
habit it was in in the beginning I made
a very strong effort to do this because
I'm like okay I have a lot a lot of
leaks and the only way to figure them
out is by marking as much as I
can and like now it's like okay Mark I
didn't know what I wasn't sure about
this part of my range I mark it like
it's kind of second nature now it's like
a habit if I go to my poker tracker
there's so many hands that are
marked that's interesting cuz you it
first made a conscious effort and now
it's automatic and think that's a good
good reminder because I was wondering
for you some people just are so curious
that they they almost can't stop
themselves from from long stuff because
they need to know and I thought that
could be the case for you maybe that is
true now but it doesn't know what start
that way so anyone listening who hasn't
got that Curiosity make it a habit like
instill intentionality towards Mock and
stuff and then over time it becomes a
kind of habit habit on aut pilot so
mistakes are always very interesting I
think it's good to go a bit deeper into
this cuz on one end your ego gets damage
you're like damn made a mistake not
quite good enough but on another side it
opens up another opportunity vehicle to
learn to get better and to improve so
for you how have you wrestled with
making mistakes kind of hurting the ego
a bit and I'm not good enough especially
now you're in the coin poker World
Championship some of these showdowns get
shown to a big audience how do you deal
with the in the moment I made a mistake
I'm not quite where I need to be to
change in that to I can learn from this
and move on you know I kind of had this
exact experience while the championship
was going on I uh bet at hand and got
shoved on on the turn and I made a
pretty big fold and then like right
after I kind of like just thought about
it and I'm like what I my thought
process in that hand was just wrong like
what and then I this could have been
biased so then I go study the hand and
I'm like okay yeah this is a mistake
that like if I want to be in contention
to be the best I can't be making a
mistake like that and that's something
that moving forward I won't because I
wor I studied it I understood where I
went wrong in my thought process and I
kind of fixed
it you learn the lesson that you need to
learn it sounds like the pain of that
error helped you to move forwards so in
terms of correcting thought processes
that go wrong in game for you is
studying with the solver you're kind of
go to or talking with friends how do you
kind of address that I know something's
not quite right with my thought process
and I want to calibrate that it's like
usually when I study I just do it on my
own at a random time I don't really have
a set time per day that I study I just
pull it up every once in a while or like
every once every few days and I run
through all my hands and I'm I'm
thinking about okay why I was thinking
this this way but for what reason right
I kind of just kind of like try to
reanalyze each part of my thought
process and what I thought was going on
with my range with what was going on
with the hand and I kind of just like
poke holes in it and try to patch them
up with new thoughts and new ideas and
whichever new ideas I like the most I I
go
with when you say po HS do you mean kind
of challenge your ideas challenge the
thoughts you having with kind have to
play Devil's Advocate with yourself I
mean if you're studying with yourself
you kind of have to play Devil's
Advocate like all right I think this is
right but what if this is the actual
right approach and then I try my best to
to find a way for the other thing to
work and if I can't then I go with that
what my original thought but if I can
then I mean there's no point in going
with the original thought right because
if I found a reason to say this this
other reason is better or this other
direction is the best one to take where
did you learn that skill of questioning
your ideas and stress test and stuff
because I feel like it's not an
intuitive way to uh to do things we
often like to be right we have something
called confirmation bias which where we
like to be smart it's quite hard to
challenge just to really keep stress
testing all our thoughts from the
opposite side so where did you let it do
that or is it something you've naturally
always done so I think in the beginning
I said that all right I'm going to try
to do this on my own and when you're
trying to do it on your own you make a
lot of mistakes and
then as time goes on you kind of like
remember okay I made a mistake here for
this reason and that's always in the
back of my head it's okay I was wrong
and why was I wrong right and figuring
out why you were wrong is like the most
important part of it so you're not wrong
again for the same reason so like trying
not to make the same mistake
twice so I guess that's why and you know
if I don't want to try to make the same
mistake twice I really need to be uh I
need to
speculate uh against like my original
thought process sometimes and you know
sometimes that leads to issues with okay
now I really need to ask somebody cuz I
can't I'm I'm not certain so sometimes
I'm close on something and I run it by
somebody else and try to get their
thought
process but you know uh well yeah I try
to do that more
nowadays does it give you a good feeling
when you realize why you've been wrong
in a s situation and then you can
correct
that um I guess it gives like a feeling
of like reassurance like okay I figured
this out it's not a question mark
anymore right so now like I'm not in the
unknown then how do you go to implement
that Implement that strategy in game I
think a lot of players they lose a
little bit of confidence in this
approach because they'll learn new
things and then in game the same doll
pattern reoccurs and they go back to the
old default and then they're now they're
like I've already learned this why can't
I just execute this strategy that I now
know it seems like for you things stick
quite well so how do you make sure the
new things you learn are going into your
game well sometimes the new things you
learn you don't even get a chance to
implement them because it's so rare that
it pops up so like the number one thing
that helped me while kind of moving up
to high stakes with solvers and you know
self study
is always understanding why rather than
like rather than or like how rather than
like okay this is happening why is it
happening like how is it happening like
how do we even reach this idea this uh
train of thought this concept this heris
so you know I would study this
and I would never really do it for self
surfice surface level
information so I'd always I always have
a reason behind what I'm doing and
that's the number one
thing it's like what I guess that's the
number one thing I focus on whenever I
play that's what I build my strategy
around deep understanding and then once
you get that it often sticks easier
because you know you know very deep
level what the strategy is trying to do
and it's not just trying to learn a a
thing on the outside in terms of a said
in yeah place in hand or something yeah
it's like you could understand the
patterns but if you don't understand how
the patterns are made then that's kind
of a flaw you want to kind of know both
I feel like they kind of go hand in
hand yeah I guess when they do go hand
in hand it's a kind of light build
moment which does stick and that it's
easy to implement on once you've got
that understanding yeah so I'm curious
to know your approach to risk taken as
you've Rose through the stakes very
quickly which from the outside looking
in implies you're uh risk Tak gambler
but from this conversation so far I'm
not getting that sense so how you
approached risk and I I use risk in the
context of using your bank roll to shot
take a higher stake and take on that
next opportunity with the the role you
have how have you approached when to
move up Stakes how much of a bank roll
you need how aggressive to be with your
bank roll management throughout your
career um well I've always like set high
expectations like if uh I I wouldn't set
I wouldn't say the sky limit if people
bit on the moon so I think I've always
been the thought that I could be good
enough to win at the highest higher
stake that is above the one that I'm
currently rolled for and you know if I
really wanted to play I'd sell action or
something like
that have you ever put yourself in a lot
of Financial Risk for your PO decisions
or mov mistakes too quickly early on yes
nowadays not
really nowaday is I'm it's I'm
conservative is uh yeah I guess I'm
conservative is but uh I think that
helps when you're on the table I think
that's huge when you're on the
table did you ever have any fear whilst
moving up Stakes of potentially losing
the money you've earned even going into
the the coin poker cash game
championships is there any sort of fear
of the work I put in to build this role
can be lost twice as quick at this this
current
level
um no I made sure I I was fin anally
like ready I was just went into it with
a with like the mindset that okay like I
could lose x amount pretty quickly uh I
think I was definitely a bit nervous
whenever I was first playing 20K n that
was definitely like I had some nerves
some butterflies in my stomach whenever
I was for sitting those tables and I'm
like wow uh each pot each pot whenever
all the money is it's 40K at the minimum
so I'm like okay this is pretty big so I
definitely I would definitely have been
nervous but now I'm kind of getting used
to it
how do you internalize those nerves you
feel do you class it as part of high
stakes performance do you uh have an
inner dialogue that goes with that are
you just in your body experiencing
that um I kind of experienced it more
physically than mentally like oh like I
don't feel like the same right now like
I know I'm nervous I think and that was
in the beginning of 20K I think the
other I was in Toronto uh uh on the on
the 10th
of January to the 13th and I got called
uh to play the VIP cash game
and uh on coin and it was very swingy
because it was like 10K n 20K bu and I
think it
was I think there was an Annie I think I
think there was an Annie yeah and
uh I think I lost 100K
pot that was probably the biggest pot
I've ever lost but you know I was in
good spirits
uh mainly because of that mindset I I
went in there
with so uh that was probably the biggest
pot I've
lost and I felt okay because I I coin
has really big time bank so I pretty
much did the best I could to make the
right decision and you know I even as
soon as I lost the pot I'm just doing
combo counting in my head doing
everything in my power to like figure
out whether I made a mistake I was kind
of searching for the mistake right and
I'm like I don't think I can find it so
I kind of
like was like H did I just make 100K
mistake and I kind of just came to terms
with it that uh you know you can only do
what you you could always try your best
and you know it's gone now so now I
can't do anything with it or do anything
about
it I think that's the key as you
mentioned there being in your body like
just experiencing it with the body cuz
that's how emotions generally work and
if we go into the mind and start
thinking oh I feel nervous why is this
here and start questioning it that when
that's when it becomes a kind of
negative impact on us but if you can
just experience the feeling and go oh
I'm human I'm playing for 40K Parts yes
I feel some Sensations in the body my
heart's Rising a bit and just been okay
with that very often you you stay in
control that's the hard part of keeping
the mind out of that kind of physical
sensation but it sounds like for you uh
obviously it's not easy for anybody but
you've done a good job overall of being
able to just allow yourself to
experience stuff and keep the mind out
of it for the for the most part unless
you go on that uh mistake hunting uh
streak to with with the
mind yeah I go mistake hunting pretty
often reney for you how do you
experience those increases in Adrenaline
when you've played higher stakes and how
did you try to maybe keep your head from
overreacting to
those I have to say I I I'm definitely
not uh not not at the level of our mean
it's definitely something that I've
struggled with throughout all my career
and I think I contribute My Success just
to good
management uh but it's definitely not
something that I am immune to and I
would say even that it's something that
I'm sensitive to but knowing that I try
to make sure you know that I prepare
well but sometimes I can definitely get
uh catch off guard and then it can
definitely overwhelm me so I would say
uh it's definitely something that I
still struggle with but it's something
that can be managed so maybe for
audience also listening like oh I don't
feel I don't feel as as stoic as AR mean
oh apparently Rene also has some issues
there there's things that you can do uh
to manage it um so it doesn't hinder
your sessions as much at least you say
I'm stoic but physically I don't look
stoic according to my friends like I
look like I'm
tilted yeah what what what is the
difference here Adam from your
perspective
the difference is like what the mind's
doing rather than what the body's doing
and how in control the Mind feels so if
the mind is overreacting to the
sensations and going oh I can't handle
this I don't like this that's quickly
going to derail performance if you're
kind of scattered and full of energy
internally but the mind's like right I
want to get this guy I want to take this
guy out you've got all this energy from
the outside you're thrashing around and
you're rocking but you're like locked in
and your mind's not worried about the
sensations and trying to create a story
around it you just your body it's high
energy you don't freak out because of
the emotions it's just like you're
you're you're experiencing it and you
can manage it you can you can hold it in
there and it's all good exactly you're
right in the roller coaster of emotion
if you look at Elite performers in
sports I think people get the wrong
interpretation of what they're
experiencing internally a lot of them be
hyperactive super engaged super focused
but in their bodies they'll be almost
like tingling with Sensations at times
but they're in control they don't feel
out their depth that they've
internalized this is this
highperformance this is what it feels
like I'm in control and the mind the
mind's the main key like the experience
in the body could be the same but if the
Mind freaks out or the Mind feels in
control will be the differentiator yeah
I remember I was doing quite some uh
reading up on this topic because I was
struggling with this as well and a lot
of it was interpretation of the signal
so let's say your heart started reading
or you started to get sweaty like it's
just a matter of uh how you interpretate
that oh I'm freaking out or like oh nice
my body is preparing for battle that's
that's actually rephrase that I started
to use at some point uh it's like oh
what apparently you know I'm realizing
this is important nice my budy because I
I remember let's say for example you get
a bit of a dry mouth or you know this
physical uh experiences it's literally
your body getting ready because it's
like Hey listen this is currently not
important let's focus all our energy
onto something else so at some point I
reinterpreted it's like oh nice my
body's getting ready because it's
important let's go all my energy is
going to this decision uh but yeah if
you don't you can you can it can
definitely start freaking you out um I
want to actually touch on something our
mean that you were tou talking about
with
Adam I don't recall it exactly so help
me out here you guys were talking about
uh solvers and you said The Works get it
to work I think you were stress testing
like some sort of ideas can you maybe
elaborate a little bit more on that what
you mean and how does the process look
of getting it to work I think you were
playing Devil's Advocate with yourself
and you're kind of testing out your
ideas
yeah so you know a lot of the time I
take what I feel like is happening at
the tables and I just throw it in the
solver and I start node locking so I
have my initial thoughts I have the
counter strategy to those thoughts and
then I kind of stress test them both and
then I go with what I think uh is the
most realistic to what I can do to win
in uh in
practice so basically you you let's say
you made a play and and Order for that
play to be correct in order to get that
play to work if I understood it
correctly you have to change some things
but if there's too much sh if B
basically if you cannot get it to work
it probably the other the other road was
the better yeah is that how I should
interpretate this I think that's fair I
think I did less of that with specific
hands and more with like range I think
I've definitely had hands where I made a
marginal play and I do some no locking
to see that okay is this within reason
and a lot of the time it actually
isn't but uh there's times where it is
so uh I kind of go into it uh with
trying to make my play not be the right
play because like if you can make your
play that's actually very interesting
because a lot of things people actually
think they they go in there with they
hand and they want their hand to be
played correctly right so doing they're
doing kind of the opposite of what you
doing well if you make your hand if you
try to make it to where your hands
correct you're not really learning
anything exactly but most people don't
really learn fig report that out right
try to prove yourself wrong is the way I
think about it yeah so basically you you
let's let's say you approach this a
certain note from a strategy perspective
in a certain way you want to you want to
basically try to get that strategy not
to work and if you cannot get the
strategy not to work then your strategy
is pretty damn damn protect
well you know the way I use solvers is I
try to base it off assumptions so a lot
of time my assumptions are right but
there are times where they aren't and
honestly what I found is uh bouncing
ideas off friends off of uh other
players that I uh have studied with I
mean there was stretches in my career me
and llama were study partners uh I think
that was probably in 2022 we studied
together for months
and then uh we kind of grew apart I
started hanging out with my Call of Duty
friends more I think he started playing
a lot more live in
Vegas so uh yeah I mean balancing ideas
of other players is great yeah I was I
was going to ask like what kind of
impact did opening up your game for
other people's opinions have on you for
example take this uh llama llama
experience he's a wild guy and he plays
like Wild guy um honestly yeah it opens
your eyes cuz you know some players
approach poker completely different than
you do so it opens my eyes to other ways
of playing the same hand which is the
number one thing like okay he played
this hand for x and x reason and I would
have probably not considered that as an
option and you know there's different
ways to win in poker 100% and uh
sometimes there's more than one
answer I mean a lot of the time there's
more more than one answer to the same
question so I mean that's also I guess
why uh why for example World
Championship like that runs right and
why there's like I don't know how many
people participated over 30 people
participating because everyone you know
they thinks they are better and they
have a certain view of the game that
they think is superior to the other and
you know let's let's go bedle and see
see right let's see who's more right
exactly uh that's I think the the beauty
the beauty of Poker you also talked to
little bit about you know using solers
and throughout the many episodes in the
podcast we talked a lot about you know
you have to understand the why but you
also emphasized a lot on the how what is
what is the difference between why
versus how so like understanding why
something does what it does is like
mainly center around Concepts and heris
I think and how I
guess is setting the strategy up as a
whole and is this realistic to apply in
practice is there ways I can simplify it
um does my opponent if I let's say I did
simplify this in this way is
it something my opponent can pick up on
relatively easy and can they do
something about it and if the answer is
no uh I'm all for it when you say can
can can they do something about it you
go back to your previous uh your
previous uh node locking in the solver
where you're going to kind of test your
strategy correct yeah I mean I try to
make my
strategy I
guess I don't want to give too
much
without uh hurting my chances of winning
in the future um I guess setting up your
strategy to lose no EV is basically the
Baseline right and that's my number one
goal whenever I'm strategy building
honestly strategy building I find a lot
of fun I've really enjoyed strategy
games in the uh past and throughout my
whole life I don't think I mention it
but I played a lot of Chess uh in high
school and growing up so that was one
game I played a lot and I basically
substituted it with
poker um so building strategies uh
creating new strategies in the solver is
something I actually enjoy so like there
was maybe I pick out a week or two in
the year and I just make uh strategy for
almost every spot and then I go with
that I think uh is practical and I think
that uh will overperform and then I'll
I'll go with
it so I'm sure there's a lot of people
in our a listening like wa this guy is
talking about I also or they they might
have a GTO description or they might
look up some hands here and there it's
like this guy is talking about using the
solver in a whole other way when you say
strategy building could you maybe give
us some insight how that process looks
like for
you and how it's different than just I
look up a hand in the it's like I grab a
pencil like paint and just start drawing
coloring everything everything it's like
um I do a lot of Nod loocking and I
think I pretty much mentioned it like I
guess I could base it off of heads up I
started playing a lot of heads up in the
last year year and a half and my heads
Up game was pretty much all over the
place I didn't really have much of a
plan uh on a lot of
boards and I pretty much for one week I
hopped into the solver and after playing
and reviewing hands I'm like okay now
let's try to get some consistency going
right and uh I hopped in the solver like
bucketed a bunch of textures and then I
looked at different strategies and then
I kind of like thought how well do I
play this one this one this one uh do
which ones overperform the most and then
I pick the one I like the most and then
I simplify it like it might be uh
simplifying to a range bet it might be
simplifying like buckets of the range
like let's say
plush draws uh straight draws top pairs
second Pairs and then kind of adjusting
it to where the frequency close enough
to theory that you know you don't lose
any EV and that it's relatively
practical to apply and I just do that
for like you know up to around a week
and then I uh study it and hop in the
hop in the
mix how do you determine which one will
overperform when you
when you compare the strategies like
okay I can approach it spot in various
ways how do you determine which one
overperforms well you can never know for
sure but you can have a good idea so uh
like I said I was playing and I didn't
really have much of an idea but you know
having a lot of experience with like
player tendency and like six Max for
example I use some of it heads up is a
completely different game uh you see a
lot of six max players just try heads up
and heads up players just like kind of
classify the as
fish so there's kind of a pretty big
game that's like the difference between
like I guess Pot Limit Omaha six Max and
Holden six Max is I guess it's not as
big but it's it's quite big heads up
versus six Max as a
whole so uh I kind of use player
tendency and I'm like okay what do I
feel like they're doing and then I just
based it off that completely it's just
all feeling um there's not basically you
you it's basically strategy that you
feel like they will so basically you
look at the response and like okay do I
feel like they're they're going to
they're going to meet this response or
they're like more likely to screw up so
instead of maybe you you first look at
your own strategy am I able to execute
this well and then you look at every
every every response to every strategy
and then you look at versus which one
are they most likely to screw up so it's
how you per how you can execute and how
they will respond that's kind of what
the term yeah I might have like had a
bit of a word sell it but that's pretty
much that's exactly what up saying I
look at the response and then
compare perfect so then uh that then I
understood that one correctly you
mentioned also in terms of making it
practical and simplifying how does that
process look I think you know splitting
range is very difficult even even for
the best players in the world and
finding the best way to split your range
in a way that you can actually do it in
practice without just kind of uh
guessing all the all the time finding
the best way to do it in the most
efficient way is uh my my plan whenever
I go into uh node
locking and that's where kind of the we
talked about it earlier certain blockers
unblockers hand characteristics come in
where like okay these certain groups of
flush draws or they have certain ristic
that make that better in the check back
make that better in the betting line
yeah or even just splitting into two
sizes that's like one of the harder
things to do because uh if you don't do
it correctly one size is going to be
exploitable and people might you know
take advantage of
that yeah so so you talked also in in
the question also about that you prefer
simplified over complex strategies
uh but from from what I'm hearing like
obviously we have to then align the
definition of simplify because some
people listening they say hey I also
simplify my strategy I to see bet 100%
for one3 in every spot you know it's
also simplified strategy but your your
strategy uh is not simple in that way so
so how has your version of simple
evolved and like what do you now
consider to be simple so in the
beginning I think the way you just said
it is was my initial definition of
simple is okay if I'm simplifying I'm
doing something pure like something
100% um and nowadays I think you could
kind of take it a step further like if
you're simplifying 100%
well you're not really testing yourself
but you're kind of making the game
practical which I think is 100% okay and
um the one downside I'd say that has is
when you move up and start playing
better players which you know I've run
into that issue I guess it's not that
big of an issue because I'm having a I'm
enjoying myself I'm competing um but uh
you can become less predictable right so
uh maybe this means I'm betting bigger
and I'm sling big bet and like check or
you know like let's say I'm on the turn
to River and I'm playing two sizes
instead of one uh that's doable but uh I
want to do it to where I'm actually
playing it well right and I kind of it
takes a lot of time I guess but uh once
you do it a little bit you kind of catch
on and I make sure all right well with
this hand class I'm going to do or maybe
with this type of suit I'm going to do
uh X action this percentage of the time
and I kind of I nolock it and see okay
is this is this a fair way of looking at
it and will I be able to remember this
in game and you know if the answers
hopefully or probably then I'm like okay
I'm going to try this out and if I find
it too you know too demanding in game
then you know I might uh reneg on my
initial decision but yeah I like I like
simplifying
even complex strategies I feel like you
can simplify them down so I I I consider
that to be still simplified but maybe
it's not as simplified as most people
would say yeah so I was I was going to
ask like what what do you think is a
common
mistake that players that make when they
when they simplify because like I said
this term has been thrown in poker quite
a lot uh but it's being interpretated in
many many many different
ways I think simplified is making it
more practical to play than what theory
is like that's pretty
General but you know I guess you kind of
just gauge that based on who you are as
a player like if this is more practical
for you I would I would recommend it
like whenever I'm studying with students
or studying with friends um you know we
all have different ideas of what we want
to do right and I think the end goal
is making the solution or like the
strategy you want to play as appliable
as possible and maybe that means
simplifying 100% maybe that means
simplifying most of
it to where you know you can play good
enough not you know maybe it's not
perfect but it's good enough to where
your opponent's making more mistakes
than you are
I think that's
saw I saw a post uh on your Twitter I
think it was on December 31st 2022 you
shared your first ever 100K month and
you wrote that 2022 was mindblown year
for you going for 500L with a 20K Ro to
playing 10kl and recording a record win
to which someone responded if you would
share some tips as he would like to
achieve the same someday now I'm sure
many of our audience would like to
achieve the same uh the same as well you
your response to that was uh study and
play consistently no secrets just got to
put in a lot of work right you already
shared a lot uh I wanted to go I wanted
to break that down a little bit more and
I wanted to maybe uh ask you if you
could maybe take us through kind of a
week in the Life day to-day in the life
of Arman maybe back in
2022 uh uh what does a day a day to-day
in the life of Arman trying to become
the best poker player L like so maybe
people can take inspiration that time
was not a lot of free time so I was a
full-time student back then so I'd have
like 17 18 hours of uh uh hours of
classes picked out for the semester so
that means waking up going to class
doing my homework and then getting on
poker and that was essentially my day
and then ordering food because I
wouldn't have time to like cook or
anything nor that I didn't want to waste
any energy trying to cook so that was
basically my day-to-day
routine it was very very simple Bland
not much thought into it other than I
got to get this school stuff done with
so I can get back and work on
poker how does how does your day-to-day
look
nowadays uh a lot
better so uh what Improvement have you
made say that again what improvements
have you made um a lot better I've done
a lot more work on my health I don't eat
out as very often anymore so uh I eat
homemade food um I work out pretty often
uh I don't play as as much video games
so I don't waste time uh so way just
waste as much time behind the computer
outside of just you know playing
poker um and just hanging out with my
friends uh I started taking Jiu-Jitsu
earlier this uh later last year and uh I
kind of stopped because because I
started focusing really hard on poker
again but now uh I'm trying to find that
balance again so now I'm about to start
going
again you mentioned in terms of studying
getting better uh that stats often point
you towards your leaks and they that
kind of points you to which note you
want to study or redesign your strategy
uh how how did you approach that in the
beginning when like I said you said that
now studying is a bit more yeah you know
there's less to study because you have
less leaks how systematic were you in
the beginning in the beginning it was
very mudded I would since I would be
marking every hand like almost not every
hand but I'd be marking a lot of hands I
kind of just worked at worked on
everything slowly together so like
rather than like let's say one two three
there's like four different parts in my
game instead of one of them getting
better at a time they were all just
slowly getting better together so I
didn't really have a focus on anything I
just worked on whatever I had a question
about at the time and then slowly it
started coming together I didn't really
focus on statistics much back then as I
do
now how did you improve on that process
um well I started looking at them I I
didn't really look at my statistics much
at all I just would look at like the win
rate right and then like I'm like okay
well there's better ways to do this I
probably didn't study in the most
efficient way while moving up the stakes
so I probably could have saved myself a
lot of time and effort but
now I uh have a good idea of what stats
uh look what stats need to look like and
when stats are off and why they're off
sometimes there's context so uh now I
kind of like let's say I set up a Google
sheet with a stats and then I kind of
like color code it like red being really
bad like dark red being bad light red
being slightly bad green being good now
I kind of do that and that's kind of how
I uh I've been working with students as
well do you set then like certain stat
goals and then let's say for example
okay my current numbers are off let's
re-eval let's go out and play this is
the spots that I have to focus on
re-evaluate next month to see you know
if they improved something like that
yeah that's what I did at the start of
October and I'm been like working on it
putting added emphasis on it when I'm
playing on these spots
and that is honestly really helpful and
it kind of helps you more than you
think I think I think what that really
does it helps you focus on something
different than the actual results at the
tables because you know you have
something else to evaluate on oh I was
trying to improve on this spot so you
evaluate your session how did it go
based on did you focus on these spots
that you improve in that right and then
you kind of also kind of let go of the
result because they don't really matter
because you're there to improve your
game right and I think it also helps you
show up to your sessions a bit more
engaged do you do you also do something
before you play like like a pression do
you run over like your focus points or
something along those
lines um honestly no I just get on and
play it's it's it's already it's already
top of your mind like oh yeah these are
the spots you don't have to kind of
remind yourself yeah like I just have
that focus in my mind and then I go play
and then you know I analyze it
later but you also mentioned uh that you
got into coaching uh I was wondering
what led you to get into coaching
because from what I understood from your
story you never really did I mean you
had coaching all the way in the
beginning uh did that actually kind of
trigger you to to also want to do
coaching yourself um I guess there were
times where I've been unproductive like
in my free time so I would occasionally
like do some private coaching with
students um and as of more like as of
recent times like now coaching in the
cfp I guess it's trying to just be more
productive with my day as a whole so you
know
give myself less free time to just waste
because like you know wasting time
during your
days while you're doing it you don't
really think about it but like let's say
the next day or at the end of the night
you're like oh I mean I could have done
something better with that part of my
day so yeah might subraction yeah like
addition did you say addition by
subtraction no it gives you a lot of
satisfaction oh well
both both I take away time potentially
being unproductive with something that's
always going to be
productive actually actually I'm
definitely guilty of that but sure to
fix myself uh what in your in your
observation of of coaching students uh
you already mentioned nowadays you have
a good a good idea of what the stats
supposed to look like or like some
common leaks that you see in students
and that maybe our audience has as well
maybe both in like common stats that are
off and and why they're off but also
in terms of their thought processes
right because that was something that
you were really focusing on as well like
some common leaks that you see in that
area as well um people really want to
win the big pods and they don't put as
much effort into the smaller ones that's
what I would
say but this is like the most common
team yeah the most common spots for the
smaller ones and if you don't uh you
know and that's the why people end up
especially low stakes and then bleeding
in those spots is because they're not as
emotionally invested because there's not
as much money in the pot
so how do we fix it you got to just put
all your focus not all but most of your
focus into the smaller pots and uh a lot
of the time it's being too passive in
the smaller pots just letting yourself
get ran over and uh whether it's through
you know denying Equity uh to the person
that's betting whether it's to just
betting thinner for Value betting more
often or you know protecting and just uh
check raising for example like you know
protect ing all parts of uh your range
versus bats uh keeping your opponent
guessing you know not letting them just
uh do their uh own game like play their
own game you know you kind of want to
dictate what's going on especially in
the small BL Adam maybe from a mental
game forance perspective what are like
the most common leaks you see in in
students you coach and probably then our
audience listening as
well I think the level it's all about
dealing with variance as uh Alan's been
mentioning just being able to uh
abstract how you're playing from the
results themselves not worrying that
you're losing thinking it's going to
come back later dealing with mistakes as
a whole in terms of the ego getting
damaged by that and not finding ways to
uh channel that kind of self-doubt into
a good larer model again like I me's
been very good at but yeah basically
dealing with the the hard times a lot of
Poker is challenging especially as
you're try try to build a bit of a
reputation for yourself move up Stakes
you just constantly getting hit in the
face I say hit in the face in terms of
results don't go your way variance comes
mistakes are all over the place you
don't know where to work on it so I
think just building a framework for
dealing with all of that the landscape
make mistakes the landscaper results
just being fine with all of it just
going bring it on just kind of that kind
of mindset then as you get higher I
think higher Stakes players are more
performance- driven it's more foral
issues it's more lifestyle stuff it's
more like overcoming all means it ition
want to play all the time which is great
at s points but can be destructive later
but I think the the law hanging fruit is
definitely around dealing with results
and then dealing with mistakes and your
kind of ego identity related to that so
for you I mean I want to do a little bit
of reflecting looking back I know it's
being a probably feels like a really
long career for you I can picture my
early 20s they felt like a decade uh so
for you your PO career probably feels a
decade long uh what do you think's being
the greatest contributor to your success
in
Pok um so kind of Di into it like Risk
Management because in the beginning I
wasn't very good at that and I think the
best thing I did for myself was kind of
take a more conservative approach as far
as bankroll goes and that helps me with
aggression while playing in poker so
like I might be conservative outside of
Poker while while while I'm working at
the tables it kind of allows me to kind
of Disconnect from that part of life you
know I'm just focused on poker I don't
have to worry about anything else and I
think like you know I've always like
given the advice of hey like if you're
not comfortable
playing uh there's outside reasons for
that and you know for me it was uh
bankroll
management so for you it was too
Reckless with your bankroll to begin
with and that was putting too much
pressure on you whil playing yeah and
I'd say like having that like level of
risk like well there's adrenaline it's
like the winds are very high uh the
losses are really
low but you know when you are
conservative with your bankroll or like
I guess more conservative uh not
necessarily just being completely
conservative not shot taking at all ever
um you know it allows you to kind of
have a disconnect from your emotions as
like everything seems a bit smaller and
not as you know uh a loss won't be as
life shattering a win won't be like the
greatest moment ever but it'll be very
nice yeah it's almost that balance point
where you can handle both sides the big
wins and the big losses and kind of keep
that calm Center for you I'm guessing
the answer is going to be yes just based
on the RIS conversation but do you feel
like your tolerance for risk improved as
you went for your career as you playing
higher do you feel like you could take
on more risk so you had this kind of bit
more strict Bank role management early
do you feel like you could loosen that a
little bit cuz your your overall
tolerance of risk is higher now
yeah I think so like maybe playing like
a stake that you know maybe I'm not
properly rolled for but I think the game
is good enough like my understanding of
how e works uh and what to expect when I
hop into it definitely definitely helps
like just building the
experience uh definitely helped me with
that so like
maybe I wouldn't do it as well back in
the day but now I could do the same
level of risk that I would take back in
the day but now with the knowledge I
have uh I can handle it handle it a
little
better yeah I think that's a key term
can you handle it cuz it's not about the
number of buyin like as a kind of
formula it's more like can you handle
losing those buyin and taking the swings
and being okay with it you said
something I think it was ear in the
conversation with Rene when you
mentioned when you were playing the cash
game World Championships that the the
money is good is good as gone it's as
good as gone I think that's a good like
kind of stress test of can you handle it
cuz it's some point to come to terms
with I'm going to be on the bad side of
erance I'm going to lose x amount of
buin I'm okay with it and I think that
was a good stress test of can you handle
it okay well just Envision it's gone
game over are you okay with it and if it
doesn't sit well with you you feel
internal discomfort you're probably out
of your depth there so do you feel like
that's kind of a stress test for you as
well yeah no absolutely like assuming
that the money is as good as gone is
honestly like if once you lose it you're
like well I expected that so how how how
can I be surprised
right yeah I kind of like that more than
like going into it like how can I
lose yeah it's interesting how many
players really struggle with this
because you say that very simply but
most players do the opposite they'll
play a higher Stak so they're playing
200s and they going to shoot 500s
they're so invested in those first five
or 10 buyin it means so much to them
losing like oh my God because it's not
just the money side it's it's the
self-doubt so as you mentioned you've
overcome self-doubt with results but
when it's the money side and self-doubt
in in intertwined it feels hard for
players so have you got any advice of
players who maybe get a bit caught up in
that a bit caught up in maybe they've
got the role let's say they've got the
bank roll but they're struggling to deal
with the the inner conflict and
self-doubt that arises from these swings
any wisdom for those players you know
hindsight is 2020 so I don't think it's
fair for me to say this because when I
was in their position I I wouldn't have
given this uh I guess explanation but
you know it's hard to say you know the
graph when you like let's say you zoom
out and you just look at the graph of
progression like it when you zoom all
the way out it's like this but when you
zoom in it's
like like Plateau down swing downswing
upswing big downswing like it's not fair
to me to say that but like yeah if you
just expect that okay if I continue
working hard there's light at the end of
the tunnel
then I can do this and I just have to
keep on working through like the pain
and the suffering of going through a
downswing and not like maybe I shot take
but I get I lose what my stop loss was
and I have to move back down like you
know it's not I guess in the short term
it's not going to be linear but in the
long term it is and you know I'm saying
that because I was in that position
myself and I got there or I'm still I'm
still working to get there but I'm on
the right track and now like I have that
self-belief that okay like it might not
it might not be doing well right now and
then in this month or you know to the
last few months um by the end of the
year uh I'm not even going to remember
it great advice I think as well to link
with that what we've been talking about
earlier being able to experience the
kind of feelings and emotions that you
have and being okay with it so say you
take a shotti and you lose 10 buyin
you're going to feel really
uncomfortable there's going to be
self-doubt you're not going to have a
nice physical sensation through the body
and a lot of people are kind of scared
of that their mind goes in overdrive and
they almost want to run away from it so
the pl safe so they don't have to go
through that where for you as you've
mentioned in like four or five different
examples you are quite good able to just
stay with the feeling not judge it too
much you also have uh confidence in
yourself that you will figure things out
that you'll get to your goals over the
long term so anything shortterm that you
need to go through is kind of just part
of part of the experience so I think
it's a another part of that what would
you see is the most important lesson
poker has taught you that you've learned
along the
way um honestly the most important
lesson it's taught me is like if I work
really hard at something for long enough
like it's almost like you know the
10,000 hour rule if you work something
work at something hard efficiently like
correctly you're not like just hitting a
brick wall and going right just running
into it the whole time uh if you work on
a skill for
very a very long time and stay
consistent with it uh you will get
results it's INE it's inevitable and
that's what it stopped me because like
before that like before poker I kind of
just heard it but you know as as far as
like I was concerned it's just like okay
that's something they said but how can I
really know it's true right until you
know you experienced it you're like oh
they say hard work will give you results
all the time like hard work over talent
all the time and you know I was like oh
sure you're right but how do I know how
do I know you're
right yeah that's the the Deep truth
right when you have to experience it for
yourself we can hear it from someone
else we can read it we can have inputs
but until you've had that experience
that's kind of the the light build
moment where it really comes true
understanding so I want to cover out
from a two two different angles of this
what about the player who feels like he
is working hard maybe he's like a volume
rigb back leaderboard grind
and he's like yeah well I'm been putting
the work in for years and I'm still not
getting the results I want right now so
it's not the work in showing up part of
it because I feel I'm doing that well
I'm still like get results what would
you say to to that type of player I'm
sure there's many of those listening who
is feels like they're put in the work
but for whatever reason the for years
the results aren't
coming well it's kind of like what I was
saying was like you should always play
Devil's Advocate to yourself like when
you're in a situation like like that
you've been at it for two or three years
but you feel like you've hit a plateau
for a long time and you feel like you're
working hard but maybe you're maybe
you're working hard but you're not work
like you're working hard but you're not
working smart I guess and that's when
like if I was in if I was in a player
like that shoes I would get I would get
other people's opinions because maybe my
devil's advocate isn't even working for
myself right so like I for one like you
know I did most of my studying on my own
but that didn't mean I didn't ask people
when I kind of hit that point where I'm
like uh I'm kind of all over the place
right now and I don't think I'm really
making much
progress so you know I kind of reach out
I'd say reach
out I like what you said there maybe my
devil's advocate isn't working well
that's a good kind of thing as well
because you're basically trying to solve
your own problems I think most of us are
going through our life trying to achieve
our goals running obstacles and trying
to solve them it's great to be able to
move past your own issues and challenges
but sometimes you hit a road block and
when years are going by you need to be
honest with yourself to go I'm not
soling my own problem very well here I
there's a blind spot there's something
I'm hitting into or can't see I need
outside inputs I need something else to
to kind of problem solve so yeah I like
that that kind of answers my my second
angle so I'll I'll move on to next one
playing playing Devil's Advocate to my
devil's advocate yeah yeah they never
end the game of always stress testing
it's always like what's the answer are
you right can we we find a different
angle to look at so with that do you
feel like anyone who commits thems let's
just use the the player pool of your
already playing poker it's not your
grandma it's someone who's familiar with
poker they can play strategy games do
you feel if anyone applies themsel as
you have in terms of effort and actions
do you feel like anyone can make it to
high
sticks yeah I think it's it's definitely
definitely possible like hard work beats
Talent all the like most of the time
hopefully but yeah I mean if you work
tirelessly towards something for very
for very long time for years um you're
GNA you're going to get some you're
going to get some
results and if you
aren't uh I would say very likely you
made some type of mistake on the
way why do you feel like many players
don't believe that's true or different
angle why do you feel like a lot of
players say they want to play high
stakes but then they get stuck along the
way and then the narrative becomes it's
too hard it's not
possible well you know it's really easy
to get discouraged whenever you're
playing poker like uh I I was lucky in a
sense because um you know I had problems
shot taking when I was trying to get up
to 500 I would get shot back down more
than once but you know then I hit a hit
a a time or like period of just running
hot and I ran up I shot took 1K like
successfully 2K successfully 3K
successfully 5K sucessfully all in like
the span of a year so but while that
happened in a
year for up two years leading up to that
it was just all back and forth plateau
uh I'm just going up and losing going up
and losing and uh you know going back to
the drawing board over and over again so
you know at some point you kind of think
maybe you're going insane like maybe you
have a little bit of mental illness that
you keep on
trying um actually I'm not sure whether
I answered your question could you could
you ask it again or if I did then we can
move on but no you did I think you as it
from the lens of I was asking why
players get stuck and don't believe
they're moving forward and you touch on
the point that you do get stuck for a
period of time that's part of the
learning that's part of the the growth
and I feel like in life it's really hard
to uh keep going to something that's
challenging to do physically mentally
when you're not seeing progress when
you're not seeing results on the outside
it sounds like for you you are able to
tap into improving getting better
working on this being a bit um over
resilient or overly stubborn to not give
up on it but that's kind of needed to to
get you through those patches I Know
Myself where I get frustrated myself as
well when I'm not making progress
towards a goal I set and I'm like I want
to be making progress and I've got to re
internalize that as this is progress it
doesn't look like progress but this I'm
putting in reps right now which in five
years time two years time hopefully I'll
see some benefits from so yeah I think
you you could it very well from that
angle yeah I'd say being stubborn isn't
really good for improving but it's good
for dedication all right heart and
commitment to the game you know Tony G
said that right yeah yeah I think strong
determination I think is uh we can push
it too far but it's needed like when
life gets tough what are you going to do
and sometimes you need to tap into
something internally it's like being
good at sports being good at Pok there
elements of it where you need to be
something in internally that keeps you
going when others would go this doesn't
feel right this is too hard I don't want
to do this so yeah I think it's a lot of
players hopefully listening will relate
to that that mindset as well so with
that what in your opinion is the most
important skill or traits po players
need to develop in order to make the
jump to high stakes that's say they're
already playing Lads of mid Stakes
they're dreaming of playing high stakes
they're watching you and go wow this guy
did what I want to do what would you say
as an oppon skills traits they have to
develop well the mental game is
important but I feel like I didn't
really clean up my mental game till I
was already like getting there right so
I'd say maybe this isn't the best advice
for some people but mental game is the
number two for me maybe even three and
the first two
are uh tireless like I
guess continuing to keep keep on
studying and reviewing your hands no
matter what is kind of just like number
one and number two is actually just
showing up every day like
consistency
so that's that like yeah that's I I
don't have anything I guess interesting
it's kind of just all
blunt when uh I'm answering this
question I love it though cu the truth
often is very simple and it's not often
the the quick hack the Quick Fix it's
often life's hard be consistent keep
showing up and do that for years and
you'll get where you need to go if
you're like yeah but what's the shortcut
there where's the Loop Round Here and
how do I get in from the back side it's
like nope it's just a straight line to
through the through the work so with
that any lessons you've learned along
the way to be more consistent because I
do group coaching with poker players and
every year we get together to reflect on
the year the most common theme
throughout every conversation is always
these areas I wasn't as consistent as I
wanted to be it's either grinding it's
studying showing up so when we say a
showing up very easy everyone knows sure
they put the hours in but a lot of
players struggle with this so how have
you solved that problem for yourself to
be more consistent no I guess
surrounding yourself with like
like-minded individuals like uh my
friend group's like we're like a
Brotherhood essentially we've been we've
known each other for six seven eight
years almost and you know we all are
trying to strive forward and make
progress with whatever we're doing and a
lot of it a lot of what we're doing is
poker so you know knowing there's other
people that you're close with that are
working hard every day or at least
trying to you know you are who you
surround yourself with a lot of the time
so uh that helps me like knowing seeing
uh my friends are working towards
something I'm also working towards
something you know you don't want to
just be left
out kind of like encourages you to keep
on
working do you feel like without that P
group you would have still found ways to
push yourself Drive yourself to do stuff
do you feel like there was enough
internal or do you feel like there was a
lot hinging on being around the right
people and environment played a huge
role I'm not sure it's like it's a
hypothetical situation like I'm not sure
uh whether I would have figured it out
or not we're continued with the
consistency that I
did yeah yeah I think it's a recurrent
theme of the conversations we have with
players at some point on your journey
you find like many people who are also
working hard towards their goal and you
get in with them and then you as a team
kind of move forward and you kind of
need that unless you're super
self-driven you're already um yeah just
going to drive yourself to do stuff and
get better I know myself I had two
friends who were way harder working than
me early in my career and they were like
this is what it looks like to work hard
I was like okay we we do 10hour days
this is what the the standard is reny I
know for you as well you had a big
influence from your peer group when your
your team decided you guys want to be
the best in the world yeah that's for
You Ren how did that influence your kind
of career and do you feel like without
their IPA group you would struggle I say
this because some players would be
listening to this going all right well
you guys keep saying right PE group
right people around you but I'm a lawn
wolf right now and I want to be
successful so do I just go networking
before I begin or how do I move forward
from my kind of current point I remember
like if if we take it all the way back
to the beginning like I was actively on
a Dutch Forum a Dutch poker forum and I
me message anyone anyone who was sort of
a regular poster I would say hey man I'm
recording my sessions let's go review it
and I remember like there were a couple
guys who replied and guess what you know
we all ended up uh uh uh becoming
successful in poker uh then afterwards I
moved to Malta in a house with four
poker players so you know that's just
poker poker and FIFA nonstop that was
basically all that we were doing and
then you just keep on chatting chatting
chatting and then actually I remember at
some point I wasn't actively I was
actively studying just with one guy but
I wasn't living anymore at poker players
and that's actually also I think when I
kind of plateaued and then in my career
you know I I when I moved back actually
to the Netherlands I started an office
teamed up again with three guys in one
office and then it's just poker nonstop
and then yeah I like I think I've told
before right that one guy Flores he
already installed that minds of hey guys
we're going to try to become the best
and that's when like necessity Rises
right like oh the best huh okay well
let's try that okay what what what would
people do if they really trying to
become the best and they like what well
let's think well maybe we should
optimize it maybe we should optimize
that oh maybe we should study better oh
you know then you start to think
creatively in terms of in terms of how
to get there and then when you have that
road I remember I had like a little road
map on on my on my wall next to where I
was sitting it's like okay I'm here now
and I'm trying to go there and every
month I would put like a DOT of where I
am now right and then next to it I even
photoshopped myself in a table with like
the Legends at that time where it's like
listen and I put it that there as well
okay that's and that's the thing where I
want to sit in like a year or something
right now we just keep track every month
every month I would kind of do what what
army alsoa said remember had a big
whiteboard to write down all the stats
that I had currently and to where I
wanted that to go and this is like eight
years ago maybe seven years ago so it
was pretty ahead of the time I'm pretty
sure so we were striving towards that
stats and that those are stats that I
thought were good right we didn't have
the GTO numbers or anything uh but these
were the stats that I thought would be
good to have yeah man then exactly what
Armine said every day show up study
grind but it's it's really how you do
because I'm sure a lot of audience are
listening like every day show up I show
up I grind I review my hands but it's is
how I think our mean show definitely for
example i' a lot of people probably
using a solare nowadays but I feel like
how our mean shared that he uses a a
solver is definitely already way
different than than a lot of the
audience audience listening and also
when he plays that he marks 30 40 hands
you know it's also different than other
people who are oh I set the golf trying
to play 2,000 hands or I have to play
50,000 hand this month because I need to
make certain hourly pretty sure correct
me if wrong Arman but you were not
really busy about the hourie you were
making at 100l or 200l Blitz you were
there to put practice in because you had
a higher goal correct yeah I never
really set win rate or like profit goals
for myself oh because you were not
interested in grinding around and seeing
if 200 Blitz was a great pool to grind
around the rest of your career it was
just no I'm here to implement this stuff
because I'm trying to get there right I
had to turn into a man exactly you had
to turn into a man right uh so I guess I
guess the advice for a lot of the
audience uh today was a podcast about
how to turn into a man right yeah our
audience is GNA turn from boys into men
there something that uh I kind of wanted
to touch on is like you said maybe
should I Network or something that's
something that I wasn't really good with
at all my my friends kind of my my one
friend his name is Daniel he did he kind
of did the networking for me he's very
good at networking he'd uh talk in
discords a lot he'd go play live and
meet other people playing live
interesting story so I think we all
played Call of Duty and uh he went and
played a tournament at the lodge and he
saw a professional Call of Duty player
there uh and his name was Steven
diabolic and he was like No And then he
was play the diabolic or stevenh was
playing Bova 2kl on his phone and my
friend goes up to and says are you sure
you're even winning in that game because
he's playing at a live table so like
usually live players playing at a live
table aren't going to win at 2K online
and then he's like yeah I'm pretty sure
and then they kind of connected they
talked about Call of Duty and then I
started playing Call of Duty with him
and then he was friends with other poker
players who had the cfp that now I'm
currently a part of and uh now we're all
really good friends we all started
playing video games with each other and
now and now I work with
them and you know that sometimes it's
all up to chance if you're not good at
networking be friends with someone who
is all
right yeah and you know you you you got
to put yourself out there like I said I
sh I was just shooting messages people
who are active actively on forums you
know and nowadays just try to just try
to reach out to people and especially in
the beginning you know uh you might have
to give a little bit more and then until
you find until you find the right people
uh but yeah I can definitely say that
all my best times in poker and the times
that I've been at the top of my game and
evolved the most was always when I was
very working closely around and daily
around other guys uh that that were all
going in the same direction uh so yeah
if if you don't have that currently find
the way to get that I would say uh yeah
definitely make that your uh make that
your your
priority
um what are you uh currently um working
on Arman in terms of you know you said
that you're trying to become the best
what is still missing in the Gap what do
you have to approve
on it's funny like I think two years ago
maybe it was started 2023 maybe it
started 2024 I was like all right I'm
gonna put most of my focus on small pots
and honestly since then it's just mainly
been that and I think there's always uh
room to improve in small pots because I
focused on big pots for so long because
those are the pots that are going to sit
with you the the most because they're
the most they're the ones that get you
the most emotional you have the most
attachment to the big ones that you lose
or the big ones that you win those are
the ones you'll remember the the most
often um but I mean I just continue my
focus on that and then honestly with
playing the cash game World
Championship um there's something that I
realized I didn't have as much
experience as I needed was like deep
stack stuff right because once you're
sitting there playing for hours and
hours you're going to get pretty deep
with players beating 200 blinds 300
blinds 400 blinds deep with people uh in
in my case I was 500 big blinds deep
with someone and I got stacked for all
of this but uh that's a part of my game
that I was probably
lacking you you said that earli in the
conversation that in in a format like
that Championship if you have certain
leaks uh they these opponents they will
point you out did you notice that as
well when when you got deep stacked and
do you maybe have an example of where
like hm maybe I'm getting owned here
because I I lacked my deep stack
experience or I lack a clear strategy uh
there was one hand like um you know even
when you aren't studied you still have a
lot of experience in a lot of other
spots so you can kind of relate it so I
did did play quite a few deep stack pots
um I actually uh played a lot of them
pretty well but you know that might have
been because I had the hand I knew how
to play well right uh rather than uh
parts of my range that I was missing uh
there was one hand I played versus lonus
that um he forbent me and I you know
made a call that was fine and you see
bets and I just check shove the Flop uh
when maybe it made more sense to like
check small and like you know it doesn't
sound like that big of a deal and
honestly like it's not that big of a
deal EV wise but you know when you think
about your range as a whole there's a
lot of things that you could do to
improve the eveve of each hand or you
know the the range I guess and uh that's
something that I just said you
know I didn't really consider some of
these things and that's something that I
need to look at and uh a lack of
experiences always going to be something
uh when of you're you're just doing
trying something new in this case it was
kind of more deep stack stuff for me and
uh yeah I guess I jack shoved and I
didn't really think about it at the time
I'm like oh this is fine I have value I
have
Bluffs but
uh the equity of like the hands I had
versus the hands he had I didn't really
consider his range as much as I needed
to so uh I kind of had a lapse in my
thought process that uh I usually
wouldn't uh if I was more familiar with
uh the
spot so process of improving that same
as we as as what we discussed dive into
the solver build a strategy test that
strategy see how your opponent responds
choose the strategy that you execute
best and that he performs or responds
against poorly you're going to get a lot
of the same answer out of me it's a lot
of britse repeat with my study process
and how I like to get better
perfect I was just I was just trying to
align so that means that we've covered
it all right so that our you yeah
probably we sometimes get angry messages
I see sometimes a comment like oh you
had this great guy on but I learned
nothing I was like okay guys I'm I'm
really trying here right I'm trying to
squeeze everything out of these guests
okay um how do you uh see the future of
Poker and how do you see yourself in it
I think poker's getting harder as a
whole because it's so much easier to get
better nowadays because I mean I think
two three four years ago you couldn't
just uh load up uh an A A cloud-based
solver and have a single race pot loaded
up right in front of you in the span of
10 seconds that you'd have to run a pyos
solver Sim your computer would need to
have enough RAM um and it would take 30
minutes an hour maybe to run you'd have
to sit there and wait and you couldn't
cover much right you'd have to cover a
single spot so now you have access to
every spot in poker pretty much
immediately so uh everyone's getting
better the edges are getting smaller and
although uh you still can carve out an
edge at the top and versus the better
players um uh everything's getting more
and more competitive so it's going to
become definitely harder uh how I see
myself in it um I see myself doing fine
as long as I keep on working like uh
people are going to catch up and only
way to keep them from catching up is
sharpening my
tools any uh any live poker uh
Ambitions I've probably played
like 40 to 50 hours alive Lifetime and
uh I think it's fun but I only ever go
and play live if my friends are doing it
and even then I don't go all that often
uh I I had good experiences live I think
it's fun to so socialize to the
table it's a different aspect cuz you
don't really get to do that
online what would you like uh the main
takeaway to be the audience gets from
the conversation we had today um the
main take Wick well I would say uh I had
a
very simple approach as I just put my
head down and kept on working but I
don't think that was the most effici way
like I think I could have definitely
reached out to other people
sooner you know I I I waited quite a
long time before I like you know tried
other opinions and you know I did
plateau and that's a part of everyone's
poker careers um but maybe I wouldn't
have plateaued for as long if I was more
open-minded so like whether it was like
you know get coaching from dis sky or
maybe do a trial running a cfp or you
know open up a course I mean that was a
question I was is like oh have you
looked at courses and I said not really
I never really looked at a course I
looked at like one video of uh one
course one time and other than that I
kind of just figured stuff out on my own
and it probably would take a lot more
time than uh it needed to so I would say
focus on
[Music]
efficiency great conversation arm mean
thank you for sharing a bunch of wisdom
with us and the audience Adam maintain
takeaways so many to reflect on I'm
going to start with the area that he
thought he wasn't very good with which
was mindset and I'm sure myself You Ren
and the audience listening will be like
actually this guy's got a really good
mindset a really strong mindset of Poker
and he's a lot of things that he's doing
very well one thing I really liked was
this setting expectations and accepting
losses before you start a session he
mentioned this before going into the K
Parker championships that he really
wanted to be okay with losing it's as
good as gone I think he said as he sits
down to player and that mindset is
really important it becomes more
important as your shot taking higher
Stakes because you don't have a sample
the money gets a bit scary so you got to
really align those expectations not get
too excited and to rebalance that by
accepting that you could lose that money
easier said than done I'm aware of but
it's something to uh to really strive
towards he also was able to focus on
what he controls he doesn't get too down
on results he doesn't really care that
he's losing because he mentions I'm
confident I'm going to win back over the
long term again like zooming out you
mentioned zooming out like physically
zooming out from his graph to see a
bigger lens and having confidence in
himself that he's going to figure this
thing out and and get better at poker
and then that leads to the second one I
brought down which was work ethic and
why he's got so much confidence he
mentioned like no glamour no sugar coat
in how do get to where he got to you've
got to put in the effort put in the work
keep showing up and you got to always be
improving he talk about always marking
hands always trying to look for small
details he said early in his career he
had big leaks so he could look at the
the big stuff but now he's looking at
small details small stats small bits of
information and when I pushed him on
this it wasn't something that came
naturally to begin with he realized that
he needed to pay more attention to these
areas so almost like intentionally got
himself to tag lots of these these hands
so he would learn them so always be
learning always be curious trying to
find those details and really care about
getting better and alongside that you've
got to have something to strive towards
his goal was always to be the best so if
you got the goal to be the best
everything needs to line up with that if
your goal is just to uh make a living or
to have low expectations for yourself
then you don't need to be as um full on
but you still got to align the the work
ethic with the the actual objective and
then the third one I wrote was handling
emotions and staying calm and pressure
it was an interesting conversation with
with you and ren Ren AR mean where they
Bas went back and forth on how the
experience feelers in the body and how
that affects the mind I think with all
me what he's very good at is
experiencing things like nerves things
like adrenaline in the body and still
feeling fine with it being okay with it
riding that kind of emotional response
and not letting the Mind get too active
that is a very hard skill to learn I can
tell you from experience of working with
hundreds of Point players that is not a
skill that comes naturally most players
are very active mentally emotions and
mind interon connect really strongly if
you feel in your body a certain high
energy emotion the mind can freak out
very quickly he seems to have a natural
Talent I'd say towards understanding
that but also he's worked on staying in
control staying in control of those
responses and as you mentioned when his
friend walks in the room he looks like
he's very animated but the mind is calm
throughout that process or at least it's
engaged and he's not letting the
emotional response uh play out in a
negative way so I think that's a skill a
lot of players need to work on actively
they need to work on keeping the the
Mind calm as the body's freaking out but
also being aware of what your body's
experiencing because very often the body
feels a sensation the Mind reacts it's
like impulse it's like oh don't like
this push away you got to very in tune
build emotional awareness of what you
experience and practice is keeping the
Mind calm even things like going in a
cold ice bath very good to train the
skill because you go in the cold water
the Mind instantly freaks out you've got
to remind the minds getting you with the
body and keeping the Mind calm lots of
practice of keeping the Mind calm in
these heighten stats or by time you
realize oh I can handle this I'm okay
with it so though came natural to a mean
most of us need to work on that so yeah
just uh C out there from that that one
yeah those are the main ones how about
yourself R what the main takeways yeah
it was funny that on the tweet that I
found him right where he shared his
result the guy was like and he gave the
advice yeah you know no secrets no
secrets he just said yeah you're just
got to show up be consistent hard work
right but it's it's how he showed up
right you also mentioned it yeah okay he
showed up every day and he said I just
play but I'm pretty sure that if we look
at how he was playing that was different
than someone else was showing up right
and he had that bigger goal he was not
using 200 all Blitz to to grind 50k to
make an hourly right he was not busy
making money right now he was busy [ __ ]
I have to figure this game out I have to
improve because I want to go there this
is just a stop right whereas I think a
lot of players they kind of get stuck
they're like they're cockling they
already oh I can actually make a living
of this also there was from what I
understood there was like no Financial
pressure where I think a lot of the guys
maybe at Mid Stakes you know they maybe
already do this for a living they have
to pay the bills so it's a very
different uh different Minds in terms of
environment uh uh that he was trying to
get good at poker in and that maybe some
of our audience tries to get good at
poker in so maybe they also try to set
up your environment in a way that you
can approach it a bit more like her mean
did in terms of technical I wrote down a
bunch of things I'm sure I'm not going
to cover it all I think he shared
actually a lot of different angles than
what we were used on the PO so
definitely would recommend listening
back to some some of his wisdom uh he
wrote down uh small pots he was very big
on the small pots right and he said
being aggressive these were the two
basically number one things in poker uh
that are very important I think we can
then kind of put those two together and
say be aggressive in the small pots hey
got got kind of merge those two advice
um also in terms of how uh because a lot
of players I'm sure they also Mark hands
and they go to the solver but he never
really talked about looking up a hand in
the solver he was always way more
Curious like how does my range play in
this scenario what's the strategy in
this scenario that's every time where
where his mind went towards instead of
what does my hand have to do right so so
also how he used the solver he kept on
talking about no loocking no locking no
locking well I'm sure that some of our
audience are listening they just look up
hands in the solver and they try to want
to know if they played their hand
correctly that's not what he's using a
solver for right he's using a solver to
to test right he said that he likes to
play Devil's Advocate test by using the
solver so he puted his strategies in and
also in terms of using the strategies to
actually build strategies right and the
way he came up with the strategy that he
decided to choose he l he tested like
some ideas okay we can play big bat we
can play small bat we can play maybe
play mix we can play range check range
bat and then he would be like okay which
one can I execute to the closest
accuracy right that loses close to zero
EV that was kind of what he was driving
for and then he would look at the
responses of all the strategies he could
choose and then he would look okay which
one is my opponent most likely to screw
up against and then based on these two
things he would then pick the Baseline
strategy that he would choose in that
scenario now it doesn't mean that he
will just always blindly execute the
strategy I'm sure he will make some
adjustments based on read that he will
get her but at least is a great place to
start from right and when going through
this uh going through the solvers he was
really focused on why but also how and
the how was like making it practical and
that's also when we started to dive a
bit more into simplification which I'm
actually very glad we touched on the
topic because feel like it's a very
misunderstood topic everyone noways just
talked about simplification and then
they think they should just range C B
every board for one3 but that was not at
all what what arm was doing and I think
also what simple uh kind of changes
right based on basically in a strategy
building process actually makes a lot of
sense that you might come to that
conclusion because that's the strategy
you could execute at a high accuracy and
that could also be the strategy that
your opponent has the toughest uh time
playing against so and then naturally
when you get better and you move up the
stakes it's it's only normal that your
becomes a bit more let's say complicated
uh but still not unnecessarily
complex
[Music]
um he also TS on when he made a mistake
it almost seems like he never makes a
mistake twice did you notice that as
well Adam he said like yeah when I make
a mistake I just look at what my thought
process was I find the hole and I
replace that hole by something that was
better and then I don't make the mistake
anymore so when you make a mistake try
to really remember and write down what
your thought process was and what kind
of maybe also what's the correction to
that or what threw you off right often I
think it's also uh an emotion that could
have thr thrown you off your F process
so that's something I guess that's also
something to work on and last but not
least I wrote down here how he improves
uh he likes to review his database right
he reviews his stats um and then his
stats Point him in the direction of
certain leaks because he kind of know
what the GTO would look like where at
least his GTO and the strategy that he
has built and then that points him in an
spot where he apparently is not accurate
uh so then that's the spot that he's
going to work on which is uh definitely
a process that I apply as well and would
recommend our audience to apply as
well okay this was a lot of wisdom in an
