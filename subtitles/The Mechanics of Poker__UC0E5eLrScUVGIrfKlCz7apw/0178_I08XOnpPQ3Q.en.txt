get into today's episode
here he is Fernando thank you for coming
on the pod
thank you for having me looking forward
Fernando I know you mainly as a PLO
player coach and I was wondering if PLO
is the game you started playing when you
started playing out poker I was also
curious what attracted you to the game
of poker in the first place
yeah so I well that's interesting my
career actually started in 2005 in 2005
or so so money maker boom so PLO was not
really on the on the radar back then so
I started playing No Limit and fixed
limit hold him sitting goes
Etc just like on the hay days of Poker
basically
and the reason I transitioned to PLO is
pretty straightforward I just couldn't
beat No Limit anymore in 2010 because it
was solved people listen to this in 20
2023 they're like what it was soft
already well not exactly I was playing
full ring no limit hold him on Full Tilt
Poker before Fulton crashed
and I was probably normal at 400 so two
four blinds and my strategy was I mean
this is a little bit simplified but but
not by much but my strategy was
basically if you flop a set you're gonna
stack top pair it's going to work really
consistently and if you have top pair
don't get stacked by the set that's
basically what you can do solid advice
yeah yeah especially for full ring poker
and it worked pretty well so just a
month before faulted went down I made 20
or 25k like three months consecutively
on two four playing just full ring
Russian cash four tables with like a
simple strategy I mean at that point I
was playing five years of Poker it
wasn't like that simple but comparative
to today
uh it was it was relatively simple I
wasn't playing a professionally at that
point but Full Tilt went down and then I
had to move to Stars
so apart from not much of my bankroll
well actually a lot of my bankroll got
frozen up on Full Tilt because I was
just under the impression like this
money just comes in forever like this is
amazing let's just spend all of it
so I had my case 20K in Full Tilt and
then Full Tilt basically crashed so I
mean they went bankrupt and they kept my
money
and it would take many many years until
Stars would bifold till then pay me back
the money to the point where it wasn't
as important anymore but my case money
was locked down so I had to move not
only to stars and play six Max but also
I had to get under some sort of staking
agreement or something similar to that
as many years ago but I remember vividly
playing six Max stars and thinking well
it's no limit it's the same thing it's
cash it wasn't it was very different and
I got crushed at 2.36 paying in some of
the six Max Stars wrecks that I that you
never saw on full ring on Full Tilt and
I just lost whatever money kind of had
left there and I had to start rebuilding
up at like much lower Stakes but at some
point I just came to the realization
that maybe uh no limit holding just like
is too tough for me now especially
because no limit had a component
and probably a lot of No Limit players
don't realize that because they don't
play any other games necessarily but no
limit Holdem has this very frequency
based approach which means that it's
very binary like you're either making a
great player making a terrible play and
it is very frequency based so for
example how often you Bluff or how often
your opponent is going to Bluff is is
completely based on frequencies it's not
based on equities
so knowing when to Bluff and when not is
a pretty tricky decision pre-solver
and and uh and what like which hands to
choose or which frequency it's it is not
it wasn't conducive to like my skill set
so in 2010
a book released which was called
Parliament Omaha Advanced Parliament
Omaha strategy and theory and strategy
or Fury in practice by Tom Chambers and
the book was priced at twenty five
hundred dollars and I decided that if I
would buy this book which probably no
one does or not many people do and I
learn all the things of this book then I
would have a huge advantage over the
other PLO players and PLO was on the up
and up so maybe that was my time to
start early with a game when I felt like
in No Limits I was kind of late in 2010
even though I did play No Limit since
2005. I I wasn't a professional and I
didn't I guess study as much or just
wasn't as skilled at the game of
frequencies as my opponents so in 2010 I
switched with the book and in 2011 I
became a professional poker player
playing only partly in Omaha like PLM
100 and 200 and uh yeah and I guess
that's how it unfolded
I'm curious as a person who basically
yes I could almost say never has played
PLO a little bit here and there
you mentioned uh it doesn't work with
frequencies how does it work you have
more blocker information on blocker
information therefore it's more driven
by the actual hand you hold or
it's more Equity based so if you're on
the flopping PLO a lot of decisions I
mean especially back then pre-solver are
more so based on understanding how
strong your hand is which kind of sounds
simple if you think about No Limit like
you got top hair and you have the best
kicker that's a great hand or a good
hand you have top pair medium kicker you
have like two street value here and one
street value hand Etc but in PLO it's
like well you got top pair and the third
not flush drawing back to a flush draw
you know like the spr is four and your
opponent is betting half pot how strong
is your hand it's like well that's a
pretty complex question to ask but it's
not based on frequencies so by the time
the money goes in the Flop it's not
about is my opponent bluffing it is how
does my hand match up Equity Equity wise
versus my put in stack off range how is
this draw basically that I'm holding
matching up versus the stack of range of
my opponent so a lot more is equity
driven and that is
those are questions that are easier to
answer for me because you can use a tool
again this is all pre-solver and you can
plug in some hands and be like my hand
probably is 43 equity and the spr is two
so we need 40 Equity to stack off this
seems like a profitable stack off if I
modify my opponent's range to this and
these hands it will be at 38 so against
type players we might not be able to do
it profitably where no limit hold him is
much more
I guess it's much more based on how
often do I have to Bluff this combo for
a balanced range and how good is my
Blocker in the spot and pre-solver that
was a very difficult question to answer
and the punishment was just incredible
because if you're wrong you're just dead
and you just feel really stupid because
you're like this guy is never bluffing
or this guy it was just really hard to
tell
and so I was I was kind of fed up with
that and yeah that's why that's why I
basically switched but I would say the
main incentive apart from Equity versus
frequency driven games was it was more
unexplored and I felt like my biggest
asset I mean
maybe I'm not sure if that's still the
case but I guess back then my biggest
asset was I had a lot of drive so I was
like I have a lot of drive and ambition
to work hard it is just that in no limit
hold them it gets paid off less given
that these players have an advantage of
many years on me but in no in PLO
because it is new if I work really hard
now then I'm going to get the payoff
because I'm early and working hard or
harder than my opponents for example
buying this 2500 book so I have an
advantage going into this to begin with
so that makes more sense to me
have you used this approach as well when
for example
other games came out after you switch to
PLO or maybe other variants of PLO have
you applied the same when something new
came out you're like hey this is a new
game I should be on top of this right
now
oh yeah I mean sometimes it bit me
sometimes it didn't but I would say the
the main difference the way I look at
the poker in general as a career I guess
to when I talk to people in coaching or
just on a personal basis is that I think
of Poker more as a Marketplace so poker
is a Marketplace just like in business
where there are different vehicles and
opportunities and some of them are shiny
and some of them are less and some of
them are profitable and some of them are
less and the casino for example or the
poker site which is a casino offers
different products so they offer sit and
goals and empty tees and cash Games Etc
and some of the products are really bad
for you as a professional player like
there are not beatable games or barely
beatable games or the structure of the
game is bad or the opponents are too
good there are many reasons why that
specific product might not be great for
you as a professional player so you have
to really understand the market and
think what is a skill that I'm trying to
acquire over many many hours that is
worthwhile and gets paid in the market
well not only now but also down the road
and that's a very difficult decision to
make especially nowadays like back then
you can learn anything you can learn
citados and entities and cash games and
live and online and PLO and heads up
like all of it it was all open because
it was just a super great Market it was
a soft market now the poker Market is a
lot more segregated and tough and and
poker players really have to be smart
about what our opportunities right now
that are worthwhile their time and also
their potential because when you know
whenever I listen to podcasts for
example I listen to many of your
episodes and I hear the question how did
you get started I'm always thinking well
it doesn't like does that story is that
story helpful for someone today and I
think you can make it helpful by
contrasting what is the industry right
now versus back then because a lot of
people that give advice today they have
learned most or they have most of their
perspective build up back then so when
you started playing poker in 2005 or
2010 like my self
the market was very soft and your
decision making process of why you would
go into poker as a profession was very
different than today so for example in
2005 you didn't you don't need to be a
mental game master in order to make
money playing poker you don't need to
have a high IQ in problem solving you
you didn't need to be able to apply
yourself
to a profession day in day out and be on
top on top level to make a full-time
income you didn't need to nowadays you
really need to do to have all these
skills
accessible to you and and perform every
day if you're that kind of person that
is able to apply himself
to such a high level to a complex game
like poker you could also make a lot of
money in other areas of of business for
example and that are way less
competitive but the market conditions
are much softer so I think the
incentives nowadays for getting into
poker are definitely different and the
player group of people that are able to
succeed and make let's say 200k a year
is very different to back then if you
make 200 000 today playing poker
especially online you have a very
valuable skill set and even more
important you have a high potential to
earn to be in a high earning position in
different fields and that's something
that a lot of people probably don't
realize when getting into poker these
days
so this is under the assumption that
when you get into poker you see it as
like an opportunity to make money right
for example let's say you have the skill
set that you can make 200k online you're
basically saying then you should compare
that to what other marketplaces other
than for example poker would earn you
for the same skill set correct
yeah poker is a business opportunity
just like any other and of course there
are elements to that business
opportunity like your daily routine and
processes and freedom that are attached
to it that are unique to it but also a
lot of these are shared with other
business vehicles and opportunities
and it's not only it doesn't necessarily
have to be outside of Poker it's even
within poker so for example if someone
starts playing poker today or not today
if someone considers making money with
poker today and making making it making
it a full-time income dependent on their
skill sets and where they are currently
located and opportunities in the market
they might be better off becoming a
vlogger and playing live versus playing
online and studying GTO like it might
just make more sense make more money and
it's more fun very very possible than
the other career path but back then
obviously in 2010 that was like
completely irrelevant like it wouldn't
even exist so it's a very making a very
like the market is different to the
point where the decision making
framework is uh is the same but where
you end up if you apply it correctly it
might be different
so if you look at the considerations
also what what were the considerations
you took when deciding to turn pro back
then and how would the consideration
look different if you would have to
start now
so back then in 2010 I was studying
economics in in the university in
Switzerland where I'm born and I was
just making too much money playing poker
on the side I mean on the side I was
making I was spending more time playing
poker and studying poker than studying
for economics but I could have
definitely succeeded in either but both
at the same time just really sucked it
just wasn't fun to do both things at the
same time because I couldn't perform it
either at a high level because it was
just too much so I had to make a
decision and my decision was more so
based on if I pursue poker this is Back
2010 I'm not gonna quit my traditional
path to make 100K a year that was my
mindset like I'm not gonna risk all of
this and just become a poker player to
make a hundred thousand dollars a year
down the road that seems stupid because
uh if you make 100K now in poker how
much you're gonna make in five or ten
years versus if you apply yourself in
business how much are you gonna make a
510 years so basically it has to
compensate for the fact that you're
taking a Financial Risk but in also a
career Risk by paying off
disproportionately and so back then I
think that dream and that Vision was
definitely uh
very reasonable there are people making
billions of dollars in poker playing
being sponsored a mix of both and it was
I mean money was free free flowing
basically left and right so I think it
was a reasonable decision to say well I
can make hundreds of thousands of
dollars a year for the next couple of
years for sure in this thing and then
see where where this takes me uh and and
I think that was like my main
that can combined with the idea that if
I work harder I make more and I'm more
successful so it's on my own accord and
there's no boss that that holds me back
from earning more and making more out of
myself was very appealing but also
something to consider is in 2010
becoming an entrepreneur or you can say
a solopreneur where you have your own
business you just want a one-person
company it wasn't really a big thing in
the online space or in the world in
general like it wasn't as it is today
where anyone claims they're making or
the they are a CEO I'm the CEO of my own
business
but anyway back then it wasn't a thing
so back then online poker was like Wow
You Can Be Your Own Boss working from
home through playing poker which sounds
amazing for people that can apply
themselves that have a good problem
solving skills and they do seek that
kind of Freedom nowadays there are a lot
of different career password you can do
the exact same thing where you're
working for yourself and the work the
harder and the smarter you work the more
you make and the more freedom you have
back then it was it was not as viable or
popular or even possible
so it was a very from what I hear it was
a very calculated or rational decision
based on the financial possibilities in
poker and the freedom that you would get
with it right
yeah I think it's a so it's a it's a
little bit of a mix uh yes to that but
also
I think I like the quote that I like
this quote that says man's biggest
burden is unfulfilled potential and I
think when I went to economic when I
went to school and to study economics
this is the that was the first time in
my life I realized that I'm not as smart
as I thought I was because there were
people in my class that were just
destroying me in smartness and the way
they applied themselves to school so in
my first year at University I worked
really hard and I reached five out of
six points you can say in Switzerland so
six is the best one the best grade and I
had like a five point something and
there were people in my class that had
six and 5.9 5.8 Etc and I was like damn
these guys are just they just are so
much better than me in this thing and
when poker came around and already had
more success in poker I was like you
know if I truly understand my skill set
and I connect a couple of
unique roads together then I can become
the best at that Crossroad of different
skills and fulfill my potential if I
follow the traditional path
of going to University I'm not really
great like I'm not a great performer
given my my position or my skill set or
what I'm what I'm born with so to speak
even if I work really hard I'm not going
to be one of the best I'm going to be
good but I'm working really really hard
so this doesn't seem to be conducive to
fulfill my potential but if I am working
for myself within poker and I use all my
skills correctly I might just like come
out on top and be also happier for it
because I'm working Within
my talents more so than a predescribed
pathway that I have to follow and so I
think that was also the appeal behind it
yeah it's interesting because for
example if I think about how I started I
did not take any of this consideration I
was just like hey sorry to play poker
game was fun I like to play games and
you know throughout playing games
suddenly I started to make a lot of
money I was not thinking about but in
general also throughout my career maybe
this was just true to my upbringing
and I think it's very true in the
Netherlands say what do you really like
right they they stimulate like your
passions and I was very creative so I
would I went to like a graphic design
school and I played games I was never
thinking about which job or which side
is going to make me a lot of money maybe
this was just in my environment but from
what it sounds like you were basically
an economy class and you also saw your
competition basically outperforming you
right like oh [ __ ] I'm gonna have to
compete with those guys they're
apparently smarter than me you also
mentioned they apparently are born with
something in a talents that make them
better an economy also mentioned Talent
what kind of qualities do you think that
these guys in your class that
outperformed you were born with or more
talented with and what kind of talents
or things you should be born with the
European 2XL and poker
I think just like raw IQ and it's just
like understanding complex problems just
faster and better
and and I think that's you know if you
have a if you have an above average IQ
which I haven't tested but I think they
have like an above average IQ but not by
many points necessarily it's hard to
confess and be like these guys are just
smarter like their engine is just
quicker in certain areas but obviously
nowadays we also know there are
different types of IQs there's emotional
IQ and the way you apply yourself and I
met people that were incredibly smart in
maths or problem solving skills but they
were pretty poor in life management
decisions
so they couldn't really apply themselves
in order to have either success in their
profession or even in their personal
lives because in some ways their
smartness was in their way but if you
take a very traditional path like
studying for a master's degree and
taking on a management position where
kind of people tell you what to do in
order to be rewarded some people with
raw intelligence perform really well in
that mind and they and they get a lot
out of it for me
I think I I perform better in
if you throw me a lot of if you throw me
a lot of
um
problems from different
you can say if you told me problems from
different categories of uh
what is the word that I'm looking for if
you if you throw me problems from
different Crossroads that require
different skills
at me so like one of them could be a
psychological problem another one is the
business economical problem another one
is like a product design problem or a
marketing problem and and I'm trying to
combine all these into like one solution
that is kind of practical and comes out
I think that is more so my skill set but
it requires a lot of autonomy and it is
more complex to identify how to make it
useful that kind of skill set versus if
you have a raw output like if you are a
superstar athlete in whatever sport that
you're specializing in it is pretty
obvious what you have to do to take
advantage of their talent but for some
people their talent you can say is like
more three-dimensional where you have to
take a step back and look throughout
many years at what's in your corner like
what your advantages are look at it from
different angles and be like how can I
make use of this in some ways that makes
sense and it's usually a little bit more
of a painful process and it was also for
me but at some point you start
understanding I'm good at this I'm good
at that I'm not good at this and
obviously I don't want to sound like
someone with like limiting beliefs but I
think there's power behind understanding
what you're good at and then thinking
how that can be applied in the real
world and making um making the most of
it and I would say that's kind of like
what I was seeking for going for a
non-traditional path going to Poker
so basically if I understood correctly
you are more in the camp of doubling
down on your strength instead of like
improving your weaknesses basically
choose a field that your natural talents
or strengths excel at so basically games
game selection in life yeah
yeah that's a that's a really
interesting topic because if you look at
people like Goggins like David Goggins
and the entire movement behind it which
I also you know follow And subscribe and
find incredibly interesting I think when
you strive for a difficulty in life so
you're trying to make it really hard on
yourself and you're trying to work on
your weaknesses it's more a thing like
an internal dialogue about
pride and about
confidence like trying to develop
confidence in self-acceptance and if you
are
I would say if you have worked through
that at some point maybe it's more about
how can I make life easier for myself
and if you already accept yourself
that's a good starting point to make
life easier on yourself but also then
beyond that if you realize that you know
not all roads are equally hard to travel
but they actually might end up at the
same destination so for example in poker
you can play a format that is incredibly
tough to beat and play against the best
players day in day out where you need to
be at the top of your game every single
day and make it really really hard on
yourself and you're doing that not for
the output right you're not doing it in
order to have the most external success
you're doing it for Pride for something
internal to like build up your
confidence to find something within but
if you mature I would say to a point
where you're like I don't necessarily
need this anymore what I'm looking for
is I'm looking to take my skills and
leverage them in a way where these
skills allow me to have the best life
quality that I want to I think then
you're usually better off at that point
in your life especially if you can
sprinkle in a couple of
a couple of like uh elements of
discipline in your life where you're
like hey I'm not like a I'm not looking
for the easiest way out in every single
alley in life but in general I'm
operating under under uh under a smart
approach that makes things easier for
myself and I'm not trying to make life
extra hard on me just for the sake of it
that's a I think I think very
interesting very good advice and very
interesting perspective so
for poker players
what kind of qualities do you think help
make poker an easier path to pursue than
for example others what makes uh yeah
what kind of qualities should people
reflect on if they have
that's interesting question I think that
if we reverse the question and say what
makes it very tough to succeed in poker
right and I would say the most people
that played poker
they come from a gaming perspective and
they look at poker like a game not like
a business and that in itself is that
makes it harder
and that is because
if you look at poker just as a game then
you don't look
you don't look at poker the poker Market
in his entire
in its entirety as a business vehicle or
opportunity as a field of opportunities
you just look at the game and you think
you need to acquire a certain skill to
win at the game and the harder you go
and the longer you go the closer you're
going to get to acquiring the skill
however you don't you might not consider
as much is the skill that I'm looking to
acquire going to be worthwhile it given
the market conditions am I learning the
right format am I am applying the skills
in the right environment is this rake
beatable am I getting cheated am I
playing in the right environment could I
move could I change the format like what
can I do in this market to succeed and
make it easier myself like those things
might not be of interest if you just
trying to win the game and I and I see
there's a lot in poker and especially
poker advice in in terms of how should I
build my bankroll well just like deposit
on the most obvious poker side that's
available to you and then Grind from low
stakes for five years until you build a
role and hopefully by that point you
have the skills to beat mistakes or
something like that and it's
it is exhausting and it's hard and it's
not smart specifically and but it makes
sense in the context or through the lens
of understanding poker purely as a game
it is like a you know in in a video game
you just enroll into the uh you enroll
into the challenges ahead of you that
are given to you you're just like well
this is how it goes you just skip a
level in a video game yeah you don't
change the game you're like no this is
the game I I can't beat the big guy at
the end so I just have to grind longer
that's that's what I should do but if
you think of Poker more as a business
and an opportunity vehicle you're like
well what exactly is the poker Market in
the world everywhere live online
different formats Etc
what are my current skills and what are
my network opportunities in order to
seek out an edge because that's really
what it is like you're trying to find an
edge in the market similar to a Trader
or someone in business and you're trying
to understand if I apply X input what do
I get out of it for it is it a lot is it
not much and also how difficult will it
be what is my success rate going to be
and a lot of the most obvious and
easiest like lowest resistant Pathways
to start in
like they have very high difficulty and
low output and along durations where you
have to apply yourself and that's like
not a great combination overall to get
into it and if you tap out of that for a
moment and say well okay let's just
forget all the things that I have done
in the last couple of years in poker if
I need to make two hundred thousand
dollars this year playing poker what are
five different ways of doing that that
are completely different like different
Pathways and you start writing them down
and then you add apply to it also do I
have currently the skill set to
accomplish this well with four of them I
don't so let's just put them out of the
window one of them I do or one of them
I'm close maybe I want I have already
skills it another one I'm close three
other ones are incredibly difficult to
attain the skills and within this one
year in order to accomplish it okay so
that seems to suck how many hours we
have to put in into each of the vehicles
in order to make 200k well this is this
what is the success possibility and then
if I accomplish it can I replicate it
next year like will I lose my mind doing
it or will it be enjoyable or fun so now
suddenly you're you're you're you're
developing Vision over a map the map of
Poker
in the like as an ecosystem and you
start thinking more competitively about
where should I apply my talent and skill
and energy into that actually makes
sense to me and maybe the result that
comes out might be an uncomfortable
short-term Truth For example hey I gotta
move countries or I have to learn a new
format or I have to hire a coach it
might be uncomfortable first but if
you're smart about it you're like yeah
but it does make sense like in 12 months
I'm going to be in a much better
trajectory in my career in poker than I
was before but I need to switch things
up yeah it's kind of like I also sort of
it's like an investment bias right it's
like oh I'm so invested in doing this
then basically if I now come to that
conclusion I have to admit to myself
that what I did for the last two years I
was simply wrong it's quite a quite a
tough build to swallow
oh yeah I a year ago for example I I
became close friends with a couple of uh
younger poker players on Discord because
we're playing Counter-Strike a lot
together and they were playing one two
No Limit online on stars and uh and and
the general Mantra I want to November
players and starters it seems to me like
is you know if you can beat this game
you can beat any game like that kind of
stuff and and this yeah maybe it's true
so folks if I can beat two of then I'll
Zoom then afterwards I can do whatever I
want yeah it's like well what does that
tell you when you beat it then get the
[ __ ] out of it so anyway I told you I
told these guys like wow you're playing
this like really hard game and like
you're making hardly any money like how
does this even make sense like this like
where are you going and then we're just
like thinking about it now it's like why
don't we just go to the king's casino
and we just play some live poker so we
met up for the first time they're from
the UK they floated they flew to
Switzerland we drove drove to the king's
casino and we played like for one
weekend and these guys are pretty young
like mid-20s and then after the weekend
they're like man like what are all these
guys doing here in the live table like
they're just losing all this money like
thousands of dollars and they're just
like completely they have like no ranges
and no clue about anything it's like
yeah like welcome to the soft Market of
Poker like here you can actually make
money with your skills and you don't
even need to be that much on point so
from that we then said okay why don't we
go to Vegas for the World Series this
was a year ago
and I'm gonna I'm gonna put you guys in
some of these games and with your skill
set and my finances like this could be a
good a good starting point so we flew to
Vegas and like now a year later like one
of those two guys made like a huge
amount of money playing live games in
Vegas with the skill set that he has
learned playing online but then changing
trajectories into into live poker in
this case and then and then through that
like if you're in live poker to begin
with you also might also come across
some people that are interesting maybe
you get into an affiliate space like you
recommend people to Poker or clubs or
you start having more um
possibilities like maybe I'm going to
create a vlog become an ambassador maybe
I'm going to learn about this guy that
has a private game maybe I'm going to
learn from this guy that I'm playing
against with a business owner how to run
a business or something so suddenly like
new Pathways open up because they're
making some moves in the market of Poker
is the way I would describe it and it
can really like pay off quite a bit so a
new opportunity show up when you go
behind away from your PC that's
basically what you're saying yeah
who would have thought that would be
happening right I wanted to highlight
though that what you're describing for
example I think you were mentioning the
like the video game you cannot pass the
ampers you're not talking about giving
up right you're just trying to find a
shortcut like a door on the right to go
around it and to basically position
yourself in a in a in a in a smarter
environment then I'm curious I had the
situation come up with uh with an
ex-student of mine who I think that
there's some crypto opportunities came
up and but he was at the peak of his
poker right
and comparing the EVS between the two
crypto would make him a little bit more
but we're talking about money that's
already passed uh past I don't know
exactly how much it was but we're
talking about a couple hundred knev
right
if you then let's say for example crypto
is a softer market and you can make 25
more let's say it was 200k let's say
poker was 200k crypto was 250k but you
you hate crypto
you you are way more passionate about
poker then should you still choose
crypto
that's a that's a great question I think
I'm myself like guilty of it's a thin
line between
prioritizing your soda called passion
versus making kind of rational decisions
for business this is something that I
learned running a business myself with
other people so when you run a business
with other people
your passion overall like matters less
and it's more about rational decisions
and once you
understand that
um
so I think the perspective that poker
players have on the game is a little bit
spoiled from the perspective that they
think poker needs to give them all
everything like I need to be always
passionate about the game and I need to
love it I need to you know tap dance to
the to my desk every day and nothing
sucks and poker is also at the same time
my favorite hobby and it makes so much
money and everyone respects me because
of Poker I need I need all of these
things in my job and it's like well
maybe that's not gonna happen you know
and if you uh
were to ignore some of those desires you
might make even smarter decisions so I
think it's a tricky and thin line you
don't want to make do something that you
hate but also you want to be smart and
the thing about poker that is different
to for example investing or business is
that the element of scale is not
as present like you can scale your
skills by going up in Stakes but you
still have to work or you still have to
play and you have to play well
and in business and investing you can
scale
you can scale your money
without necessarily adding more hours or
complexity to the task which is pretty
appealing in poker if you want to make
more money you need much better skills
in investing not necessarily like you
can have the same skills but just more
leverage because you have more money and
you can make a lot more money and
another leverage effect of business for
example is that in business in general
as you become more successful and more
skilled it generally gets easier so you
hire people for example they do stuff
for you so that's easier you learn
things that allow you to work less and
more efficiently and I would say in
poker the longer you are in poker
there is a you can almost say like a
deflationary effect happening which is
that your skill becomes less valuable
over time because the game becomes so
much tougher so it's actually kind of
difficult
to justify it's kind of difficult to see
a super bright future in the sense that
your skill set will be worth generally
less down the road and also
um the willingness of people to play for
a lot of money might go down as well for
several reasons we can discuss like
online for example like 10 years ago
people played more online than nowadays
for example
so I would say from that from that
perspectives individual from that from
that individual's perspective I would
say
what is the skill set of getting into
the crypto Market in that example worth
in five years
versus the opportunity vehicle of going
into putting that time into poker right
now because
um
because that person probably is going to
be active and alive in five years from
now as well and probably wants to do
something that that is leveraging the
time and respite now for the next five
10 20 years so I think weighing these
options is definitely relevant as well
as well as you never really know what
you're gonna like uh once you're good at
it because for example running a
business is really tough when you're a
noob and it's really exhausting and it's
not a lot of fun in many aspects because
you're a noob but when you're better at
it it becomes more fun because now you
know what you're actually doing and
you're not making huge blunders and
you're not costing yourself massive
amount of time for small tasks all the
time so I think
a lot of things suck in the beginning
like going to the gym but you shouldn't
always judge your enjoyment Factor based
on your first hour in it
it can also become a lot more fun once
you're skilled
yeah I think I have read some studies
showing that basically the more you
progress in skill then you actually
start enjoying the certain task way more
uh it's not necessarily the task it's
more how good you are at the task in
most cases
um
it's you know if you look at people that
are going to the gym you know like Adam
and he's like lifting the
175 kgs on the on the half rep raps and
Squad in the squad rack and so on people
are like like people that don't go to
the gym and lift they're like how is
this ever fun there's no way this is fun
but if you go to the gym a lot you're
like this is the most fun I have all
week
for whatever reason because your brain
chemistry or your neurons I don't know
Adam probably knows better but it's like
I know personal experience going to the
gym and lifting hard weights is like
it's the Highlight it's amazing you know
and some people could completely not
relate
but it's it's funny actually when you
talk about the gym let's say for example
you haven't been to the gym probably
they still doesn't happen to you two
guys but uh let's say you didn't go to
the gym for a week or two weeks and you
come back that first championship
session really sucks but if you've been
going regularly
and then like you're in a nice flow
you're you're upping up the weight
that's when it starts to feel good so I
can I can I can strongly relate uh to
this feeling listening to your story I'm
definitely more I would say a bit more
of a gamer at some point I do do you
recall that uh I think it was letter s
who dropped the book Twitter poker like
a business yeah but probably in the same
time like 2012 something something along
those lines and that's actually I read a
book and I was like huh so this is this
is this is how you can also look at it
but in the same time I remember maybe
it's still up to through until today but
definitely less but in the past like the
bum Hunters right they were kind of
looked they were kind of being being
shamed in the corner but I remember at
some point I think it was Elliot Rowe
who said well maybe it's the bum Hunters
that try to talk shame on you so they
could take all the money right they're
trying to try to make everyone believe
that Batman ticket bad blah blah so
there was also some sort of conditioning
especially for me uh that I had to go
over like okay maybe game selecting a
bit more is actually a good idea whereas
in the past I was kind of conditioned
like oh shame on you uh why why would
you leave this table uh you know to find
a better table it was there was also
like some bad conditioning around or at
least talking from my personal
experience so if people listening maybe
have the same idea I definitely think a
lot of the advice you gave will will
help them break through that I was I was
curious when you decided to
to pursue poker professionally how did
your environment react to that decision
so I was living in a student's apartment
when I was studying in a one bedroom
apartment I mean it was uh it was just
one room with my bed and my desk and
there was like a shared kitchen for all
the students and I was living there
during the week and on the weekends I
would go home to my home city which is
an hour away to my parents and uh
yeah I mean they didn't really know that
what they're paying for is basically me
just studying PLO in the class of
University but at some point it was like
okay I need to I was like I'm going to
quit this school thing and so I told
them I was like you know it was not a
surprise to them because they obviously
knew I'm like heavily involved in poker
and all this kind of stuff and and I had
my success with it and they were not
really against it like my father
basically said you know if you want to
be a professional focal player that
means you're self-sustaining and that
means you need to like
sustain yourself so that's completely
fine but you have to like move out and
do your own thing and I'm like yeah of
course like I'm going to move out not a
big problem and then many years later
when I talked to him about that he was
like you know Fernando he has two three
children
uh it's like he was never lazy he was
never lazy and I knew that the decision
to become a presidential popular was
never out of laziness it was like he
he's gonna figure it out he he did this
because he wanted to achieve a lot of
things he wanted to do great things so
there was not a lot of worrisome of like
oh he's going to drift into some weird
thing that he's not going to get out of
it it was like he's doing this because
he wants to like find great success in
some way or the other he's going to do
that so they weren't really worried
about that at all and apart from that in
terms of environment I mean
my personality of like you can say
in some ways I have kind of like a try
hard personality like I had this
personality even when I was you know 18
or 20 or 23 when I became professional
focal players so my environment was
never like oh my God you're making this
irresponsible decision like this is what
are you gonna do like this is bad or
whatever they are just like yeah this is
just what he does and like he's gonna
figure it out and I had a girlfriend
back then and she was also studying with
me and she would just continue studying
and I was doing the poker thing but
there was never like the fear of you're
gonna mess it up in some sort of way
around
for them
for me I mean in the first couple months
I was like if I mess this up it's gonna
be pretty embarrassing because I think I
think every poker player has the biggest
it doesn't sound to be true in your
environment but usually people are like
me poker so if you always sort of
impressive like yeah I cannot let the
feel because then they were right about
that this maybe not being the most smart
decision but did your parents and knew
something about poker or they just had a
very big belief in whatever you choose
you're probably smart enough to make the
right choice did you have like a sort of
role model that you could say look this
is you know what people are doing
and oh well to this day my parents don't
really know the rules of Poker that well
but it was just fine I mean in the
beginning when I was more like
less developed I guess mature like
matured uh I had more problem with that
but now it's like yeah I mean they don't
really understand poker but they
understand me and I think the way you
sell poker to your environment if that's
a problem is I wouldn't look at poker as
the or you're I wouldn't look at your
environment as the problem necessarily
or even poker it's more what they see in
you right what you represent because
they don't understand Pokemon if you
tell someone I play poker for a living
they don't understand poker they're
trying to make a form an opinion and
that they have they might have some
biases because they heard about poker
but if your personality is so strong
they might just overwrite that and say
well if you are playing poker for a
living there must be something to it
because you're a serious person and
you're driven and you're ambitious and
you're professional like there's
something more behind that apparently
because otherwise you wouldn't do it so
if you if you um project that
personality and seriousness into your
statements and into into your
conversations about poker they're going
to respect they're gonna be like okay I
never understood poker but now that
you're explaining it to me this makes
total sense like you're you're like a
Trader you're informed in making
informed decisions on a high level
you're swinging you know lots of money
back and forth but at the end of the day
you have the edge I completely
understand and then you you just explain
to them like what are the essential
skills where you need discipline and you
need to be an autonomous worker you need
to make decisions for yourself how you
want to structure your career you need
to have bankroll management you need to
uh
be a solopreneur basically like an
athlete and every single day you need to
learn and apply yourself and make sure
that you make the right decisions it's a
high uh it's a high stress job but at
the same time you have a ton of
responsibility like that's basically
what poker is all about and if you sell
it like that and they and and you have a
certain seriousness behind it they're
like ah okay well that sounds like a big
deal that sounds like uh that sounds
impressive to me that you can do that
and suddenly they look at it completely
differently
yeah it's it's not necessarily what you
do it's how you how you how you bring it
across right you can say yeah well you
know I I play poker for a living or you
could say well actually I'm a
professional poker player and you know
bring it with some enthusiasm not only
in poker but let's say you have a
different job that's
um
maybe for the society maybe a bit shamed
upon or looked down upon listen it's
just if this is what you want to do and
you can convince it with passion and you
and transmitted with passion this is why
you do it then then that's gonna leave
the impression on the other person so
yeah definitely how you say it it makes
way bigger way more of a difference also
down the road like now that I'm now that
I'm more matured I would say overall and
I look back in a more reflective manner
to to all these things I would say
someone that is just like younger in
their 20s and they they want to get into
poker and they're trying to convince
their environment or even themselves the
number one advice I can give you is
words are extremely powerful so you
never want to down talk poker or your
profession or the series is behind it
even to yourself because it really gets
into your system so I just play poker
you know like it's just the thing like
never and then it becomes sort of you
also start to believe that you start to
instill that mentality also in yourself
the more you're absolutely you're just
projecting it into your own mind and
you're just sabotaging yourself way I
would just wake up and tell people like
I play poker it's like really high
stress and responsibility but I manage
it well and I'm prepared for it and I
study every day because it is what I
want to do it's not easy but I do enjoy
it and I do take on the challenge so
that's I mean I'm an athlete of my mind
basically with my mind I mean Adam knows
it poker athlete program
that's how you should talk about it and
if you do that every single day to
yourself to your environment there's
just like no denying in that this is uh
this is something to to take Serious
yeah if you say it with confidence they
will be confident in the fact that you
save this confidence and therefore will
succeed so they don't have to worry so
they can support you basically yeah and
you oftentimes with parents and parent
pressure it's also like one element of
it is like they don't know how to tell
their friends right oh your parents for
all the guys that are young they also
have friends by the way and they don't
want to be it's not only you as friends
like they have friends too and they
don't want to be embarrassed when their
friend is asking them well now that you
have raised your son for 18 years or 20
years or 20 what what is the great thing
he's doing with his life what did you
instill in this in this young soul and
then they're like it's poker he went
wrong yeah he's gambling at the casino
and they're like oh my God what did you
do where did it go wrong yeah you know I
I can see that actually I remember my I
talked about this with with my mother
actually and she actually says she
always talks with pride about me against
against her friends but I don't know I'm
sure it wasn't always the case like
obviously throughout your career once
your career career takes you know has a
certain duration you achieve certain
success I guess they can say that but
especially in the beginning I'm sure
among her friends they were like well
let's talk about Renee because I have
some concerning he made some concerning
Life Choices
absolutely not I mean if if you know
your own child is like I'm gonna do this
like nowadays you know poker but it
would be something you know I'm gonna be
a tick tock dancer or whatever and it's
like oh my God what are you doing go to
school let's just yes all about that
like because obviously it's going to be
something that we might not know now as
you already pointed out but I think the
best way let's say for example my kid
would come to me I'm gonna use poker as
example I'll probably I'll probably do
some research myself like what is this
poker thing what are kind of the things
you have to look out for how can I
support my child to make sure he
succeeds because I'm sure in any any
Endeavor that he chooses they're
successful people so I will try to
support my child in a way that he or she
will success in whatever Endeavor they
decide obviously if it says this I'm
gonna become the biggest drug dealer in
the world I'll be like hey hold on hold
on it's my Scarface if you reconsider uh
but you know as long as it's uh legal

further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode
Adam when you considered by poker was it
the same did you go through the same
process as Fernando I know you always
play I had some sitting goals did you
scan the market and be like headset it
goes that's where the money is or was it
unless of uh
yeah thought out decision as Fernando
did yeah it was very interesting
listening to Fernando's perspective on
how to approach polka like a business
and almost stream poke like a
Marketplace for me I had two friends who
had done a bit of scanning of the
marketplace so to speak and they found
heads of sitting goals to be very
lucrative through shock scope with all
the rankings so in some way it was
selected because this Avenue was
lucrative but it was very very loose
there was no research there was no real
path and as Fernando was chatting there
it really got me thinking about this
look into perspectives one of business
like poker is a business and you're
picking the marketplace that's almost
like the zoomed out lens of what games
do I want to play and then random your
approach and also probably my Approach
was once you've decided you've scanned
the marketplace so to speak you've
picked a game that you want to play then
you want to play the game which is the
narrow lens like the short-term lens of
what game do I want to play I found it
very interesting how you were talking
about kind of optimizing for the
external Pursuits I wonder how players
can also make sure they are also taking
the box of the internal Pursuits I
always think there's two games going on
in life we're trying to win again
recently he's scanned the market decided
on the game he wants to play him and now
he wants to go all in and optimize that
game he wants to Achieve Financial
things which is the external Pursuits
but he also wants to feel fulfilled and
become a better person in himself but
you how do you balance those kind of two
maybe somebody's conflicting goals of
one I want to move towards some outcomes
but also I want to feel fulfill to
myself and I feel like I'm in line with
what I want to do long term
yeah I think in we get a lot of
messaging and signaling through social
media about you know feeling good about
ourselves and and um you know you should
be fit I mean you should be a lot of
things these days like you should be in
shape and healthy and intelligent and
travel the world you know like all these
I mean you can enlist 10 other
attributes to it that you should all
all do and I think that uh
snow winning recipe basically like you
have to prioritize a couple things for
me
I think the people with ambition
the best thing to optimize for first is
do something that you're proud of
more than prioritizing happiness
happiness is very fluffy in many ways
hard to describe what it is when it
comes when it goes Etc
but just ask yourself if I look back at
this am I proud of myself doing this
like is this something I'm like yeah
this is what I did I'm proud of myself I
grew I grew in the pursuit of doing this
it was worth my time I put in the effort
I got the reward I can tell this to my
kids this is something I'm proud of
doing and optimize for that and everyone
needs in business you have business
principles that you operate under you
should also have like your own poker or
business or life principles yourself
that you prioritize and if you list all
these things like health and and and and
and wealth and connection networks and
fulfillment and passion and you put them
all at the same level of importance
you're not optimizing for anything
because priority means that you
prioritize one thing maybe two things so
I think at different stages in your
career in your life you should
prioritize different things but to begin
with if you want to achieve something
like out of the gate if you're a young
20 year old guy that hasn't achieved
really anything financially
professionally probably the first thing
to aim for is how can I do something I'm
proud of professionally and and just
optimize for that and that will make
sure that if there are periods and there
will be periods where things are not fun
and they don't make you happy but that's
okay under your new lens which is I'm
doing something I'm proud of if you
always optimize and ask yourself well
but am I happy am I happy you're going
to have so many mental roadblocks to
just do the thing you need to do right
now and pull the trigger and just work
because you're always asking yourself
well I could do this now but I'm not
really happy with it at the end of the
day you're just going to be some like
really
fluffy weak person that is not proud of
themselves because they were optimizing
for the wrong thing now if you are the
later stage in your career let's say you
already have achieved financial success
and you're proud of yourself and you
apply to yourself at some point you know
maybe you want to change perspective and
you say like well now I want to optimize
relationships now I want to optimize
um fulfillment or a different passion or
giving back or bringing up others or
whatever it could be raising a family or
feeling more love feeling more
connection to people or more happiness
with myself or internal spiritual
findings whatever it could be but if
you're trying to optimize for all things
at the same time you're not going to
lend anywhere basically and so for young
ambitious people that haven't achieved
anything so far that is what's
meaningful to them that they feel proud
about just optimize for for being proud
of yourself
I like that and I was reflecting as he
was speaking there on my own life and
the things I'm most proud of sometimes
overlap with happiness but very often
it's more in line with effort over time
to get an outcome which often inclines
growth I'm improving I'm getting better
or something and often the day-to-day is
actually not overly enjoyable very
mundane stuff doing the same thing
repetitive but I feel proud of being
consistent with that over a long period
of time so yeah I really like stemming
towards what you'd be proud of rather
happiness I think this is where a lot of
people get lost where they try to figure
out this kind of what will make me happy
every day and they have periods of time
where they're not happy which is we all
have but I think the proud is a better
one because it's more effort towards an
outcome of a time which is really good
all right so let's transition into when
you've chosen to play the game of poker
you've selected your Avenue and you're
right I'm playing poker professionally
let's go to a challenging part in your
career so you mentioned to us 2013 in
particular was a very challenging time
where your bankroll went down to around
40 km so talk through what was going on
at that time and what was the challenges
you were experiencing in that part of
your career
yeah so 2011 January 2011 I started
playing full time and I had only not
advisable fifty thousand dollar bankroll
uh in Switzerland that is uh that's not
a lot of money especially today but even
back then it was a lot of money and I
was living in my students apartment this
one bedroom thing I was basically uh I
was I was telling them I still go to UNI
so I can stay in the 700 one bedroom
thing which was also I mean it's pretty
it shows you how expensive Switzerland
was back then even so anyway I was
living there with these ten thousand
dollars I
uh bought 10 hours of Jared Handler to
learn how to become a professional for
twenty five hundred dollars and I bought
the book for twenty five hundred dollars
the book that I mentioned before for
plos I was down to ten thousand dollars
and from 2011 to 2013 I was able to
like grind it up in PLO winning some
tournaments and playing some live poker
to baby like
150 000 or something and then I just
like lost a bunch of that playing two
high-stakes cash games like PLO cash
games and I dropped all the way back
down to like 40K or something and I
switched
at 40K net worth you can say I switched
to
hyper sitting goes uh 30 and 60 high
percent goes on stars because I felt
like they were more sustainable to like
built by bankroll with less swings and I
also lost confidence in my PLO game
overall and in hindsight like it might
not have been
the smartest decision I think it would
have been better for me to play live
poker because live poker No Limit back
then you can control Barons incredibly
well like you don't have to Bluff you
don't have to do anything of high
variance because people are just going
to pay you off this is 2013. you can
just control bearings really really well
and but anyway that back then I moved
into sitting goes and
yeah that was that was a pretty
challenging situation because I put so
much of myself into the poker career
from 2011 to 13 that I gained a lot of
weight and I became really off balance I
was like overweight didn't have many
like social contacts and I also my my
poker career wasn't down in the
downswing basically and I had to switch
formats Etc and then to top it off my
three-year relationship then uh
well quit on me or like my my girlfriend
ended a relationship back then and I was
like holy [ __ ] this is like a storm The
Perfect Storm which was a great
challenge because I was like you know
what I'm just going to turn this all
around I'm gonna go to the gym now
because I need to go and I'm gonna like
learn these sit and goes and so on and
then from you can say from
May or something of that year until
September
I lost a lot of weight get back into
back in shape I beca I had a roommate in
my apartment now so I can lower the the
costs per month I went to the gym I
granted my roll up to maybe like 60 70k
and I was in a much better Rhythm and
then at the in September after putting
in all that work and effort and when
when going through the hardship of
losing my ex-girlfriend back then I won
the Sunday million for 180 000 and I was
like this is like the perfect metaphor
you know like this is a signal from from
from the poker Gods uh to reward me for
like the last three years of just like
putting in all this sweat and and effort
into this career and that allowed me to
for the first time in my poker career to
take a little bit of a step back and be
like okay what do I actually want to do
in poker
um let's go back to PLO cash and and
let's start approaching it again from a
more balanced perspective like losing
the girlfriend and gaining the weight
and and going downhill with my bankroll
it really like taught me a you need to
approach this entire poker situation
from a much more balanced perspective of
working not only hard on your career but
working hard on your relationships
working hard on your physicality working
hard on your routine if all those things
if if you don't Master basically all
these elements that you're going to
crumble in this career and I mean from
that point on moving forward I was just
like progressing in a positive direction
basically
yeah so there's two things I want to
touch on the first which I found went
fascinating was at the start of your
career you had about a 15K role and you
spend 5K on coaching and a book so you
spend 30 on your role right out the gate
so first of all what give you the kind
of initiative to go with that and make
think that was a good like the rest of
break room for you because I know a lot
of people will be like wow there's zero
chance I can use any of my bankroll
right now I'm super low but you made two
Brave decisions to buy probably the most
expensive book of all time and invest in
yourself with coaching what made you
think of doing that uh
it yeah so in my career I spent over a
hundred thousand dollars in coaching in
different in different kinds of
coachings and for example Adam and
myself we worked together for a year now
on performance coaching you can say so
I've been coached basically my whole
life and I think the reason is because
the the ROI is like incredibly high on
on getting coaching and if you don't
think so it is just because you don't
understand your own potential like
basically getting coaching is not
betting on the coach it is betting on
yourself just as much betting on
yourself to grow through listening to
someone else and getting an other
outside perspective that you value and
gave authority to if you can't give
other people Authority you're just like
delusional you know if you look at some
people look at I don't know business
Talks on YouTube uh this guy is a fraud
yeah but he has made like a hundred
times more money than you you know like
what does it take for you to give
someone authority over any space are you
so ignorant to not realize that you can
probably learn something here so I think
people that just don't understand
coaching they're just not they're not
malleable themselves they can't accept
another form of authority they can't
give
someone else
um any any sign of like Authority or
respect that they would then change the
behavior based on outside perspective
and advice but if you are actually you
can say enough
humble in some ways to actually respect
someone else's opinion than the ROI on
coaching is incredibly high it's like
sick of course throughout my career I
had coaching I was more happy with and
less happy with that's just part of the
business but the the main the main base
point is still the same are you able to
grow are you able to learn from someone
else if the answer is yes the ROI is
really high on coaching the only reason
why a misalignment could be in place is
because
some coach might be not the right coach
for you at that point in your career for
example
let's say there is a guy that plays PLO
50 or something very low stakes PLO and
he comes and he says I need the PLO
coach sure I could coach the guy but
there would be a misalignment in what I
need as what I want as an hourly in
order to be worthwhile my time at this
point in my career and what this guy can
afford and how much I can do for him at
this point in his career so he would be
better to get a cheaper coach because
he needs if he spends let's say 200 per
hour on a coach she needs to make that
money back to we have a positive Roi
investment at the stage that he's
playing in that could work out if he
pays my hourly like it probably wouldn't
work out so it doesn't make sense at
this point if you hire today Tony
Robbins it might not make sense to spend
a hundred thousand dollars or a million
dollars actually I think it is per year
to get coaching from Tony Robbins
because not because he sucks it is
because you don't have the kind of
output financially to make it worthwhile
to get that extra information like if
you spend a million dollars you're not
going to make another two million
dollars because your business is not in
that position right now so you just have
to find the right coach at the right
time so the the investment does make
sense but I'm I've always been like I
haven't not only I have not only spent a
lot of money in one-on-one coaching but
also in Mastermind and courses and and
seminars and like flying to people Etc
just to get advice even talking about
attorneys lawyers CPAs like the the best
way the easiest way to make friends
sometimes is to actually first buy the
relationship so the way you buy a
relationship is you go to you do a very
high
and you go to a tax
attorney or you go to a Tax Advisor that
is very high-end you you buy their hours
so they can advise you and over time and
over years they probably will leave some
nuggets about business and life and
taxes in your conversations with it the
ones that are paid and the ones that are
not paid like that's usually how you
make connections and buy yourself into
in different circles and I have done
this like many many times in my life and
through that I earned and and the best
advice that I could afford that's also a
good quote that I like is like pay for
the advice for the best advice that you
can afford
I like that and I like the framing you
use there of investing coaching is
investing yourself more so than the
coach and I really like that because I
think often when people take on coaching
Arrangements they can sometimes
Outsource their success to the coach
when I realize like this is your life
the coach is going to guide you but
you're investing yourself this is you
trying to get skills in a faster way to
help on your progression so with this
mindset I'm really interested to know or
when you realize this law points that
The Perfect Storm as you described it
everything's going against you you've
really created cut list within you to
change things around I want to know how
you start to change things around and
how you notice changes in your career
trajectory after that after that moment
yeah so back then 2013 I was still a
young kid a young and dumb kid so I mean
now I'm old so when you hear me talk
about back then sometimes I'm talking
about me now just for the listener to
realize you know like when Renaissance
for example oh you figured it all out
that when you started playing Pokemon I
probably didn't but in hindsight and
more reflective manner you know like
that's how I puzzle it together so when
it comes to
when it comes to dealing with adversity
now me as a mid 30 year old that is
emotionally more regulated I would say
the the the biggest piece of advice is
that your emotions don't have to guide
your actions and that's a very important
distinction to make so your emotions are
all good and fine and it's completely
fine to feel demotivated or angry or sad
or whatever it is that's fine but as the
moment it starts guiding your behavior
that's the problem so it's not about
becoming a robot and just removing
emotions all together because you're
going to suffer way more by doing that
than than by trying to control them it
is more about understanding that you can
feel any way you want but your actions
are are not connected to that oftentimes
which is called discipline right so okay
I don't feel like doing this well it
doesn't matter you don't have to feel
like it doesn't have to be fun it
doesn't have to make you happy right now
like all it it doesn't have to do
anything you just have to do it
basically and I think we it depends a
little bit on which cultural background
you're born in
but the ability to just do something
just for the sake of it is something
that is true strength and in in a lot of
today's culture everything has to be
second guessed do this why I don't feel
passionate about it I don't want to do
it I don't need to do it well yeah but
just do it no you why I don't have to do
it so why should I do it so
if you think back about different
cultures you know for example my my
girlfriend grew up in the Philippines
and
um the the cultural background is more
like you need to be successful to
survive so let's find how to do that
today if you're lucky enough to be born
in a different environment parents that
are maybe more financially stable or
successful a country that offers more
opportunities and more safety especially
when you [ __ ] it up then you might not
have that kind of mentality which could
weaken your ability to just do something
because you need to do it
so I think these days if you feel like
oh I'm in I'm at a low point you know
well principle number one don't use the
wrong language you know I'm at a low
point I mean that sounds like it sucks
so obviously you don't want to tell
yourself you're at a low point
um but you can say this is like a real
challenge I'm going to take on a real
challenge today because today I feel
like I feel like my energy is not at
people at Peak Performance but I'm going
to perform my Peak Performance anyway so
today is going to be a challenging day
it's a character forming day like you
you insert the language first of all in
order to also rewire this on
misunderstanding of my emotions have to
guide my behavior so whatever situation
you're in at the moment just understand
that
focus on the most practical thing you
can which is the output the action the
behavior and you can hyper analyze your
emotions afterwards or before that how
much however long you want but what
really gets you paid so to speak what
makes you but allows you to make
progress is the hyper practical actions
you're going to take and if anything is
in your in your in your way of executing
you're going to suffer more long term
because even if you get if you give in
into your emotion of feeling depressed
or not taking action and you don't take
action because of it guess what you will
feel more depressed the next day because
you're even lazier that day than the day
before because there's another day you
just wasted another potential you just
you just continue the story in the cycle
of you being unproductive in in in and
being basically
um
imprisoned by your emotions you want to
break that storyline and just do the
freaking thing without having to hyper
analyze your your emotions
I love that you mentioned your
principles I look forward to reading
your life principles one day as a book
hopefully our audio and yeah you
mentioned it very interesting the way I
was kind of thinking about that's kind
of analogy I use with emotions it's
almost like a conflict between the
action you want to take and the
emotional state you're in as a mismatch
and very often we go with the mismatch
of the emotion because that's generally
dominant it's like I don't want to do
this it's aversive and we take the path
of least resistance so I was wondering
for yourself like how do we get so clear
on the actions we should be taking all
right because in order to not act an
emotion we need an element of will which
we could see is like exerting ourselves
to overcome a certain kind of feeling to
take a path now if that path's very
clear they say I need to do this to get
this result we can quickly use our will
to overcome the kind of emotional state
we're in how do you learn to be very
clear on the actions you're taking
because I think a lot of people struggle
with this because they generally end up
in a situation and they kind of go in I
should do this but it doesn't really
matter in the kind of indecisive with
the actions they should be taken it's
not like Clarity of the person I want to
be will take this action then later they
might in the emotion in any situation
and then regret that later and I always
think like often the the challenge they
have these people is they weren't clear
enough with the actions that were going
to lead to forward motion towards their
goals so for you how do you learn to
create enough of a direction that you're
going in so the action in the moment
becomes more obvious and you can
actually exert your will to to override
emotions if that makes sense
yeah absolutely absolutely I think the
the biggest hurdle that we face as
solopreneurs or poker players you can
say is that you're just one engine
you're like one entity basically it's
all like your your private desires your
personal desires and your business
desires are all in the same system in
the same brain and they're hard to
prioritize at the right moment you
realize how different that is when you
start working with other people together
so if you work on a business and you
have an employee and you're like do this
and they don't do it it's like
incomprehensible it's like I don't care
why you didn't do it like I don't well
it wasn't in it wasn't on my passion
plan today it wasn't I didn't do my
mindset meditation in the morning so I
don't care like you just do the thing
that was what was the job it's just do
this thing right so
what happens there is you create some
distance between your own desires Etc
because you're telling because it's not
about your desires you're telling
someone else in your business to do
something and you clarify on the task if
you can do this for yourself you want to
think of your own system like a
like a production it's basically like a
machine or you know it's like a Tesla
Factory where P you have different you
have different departments essentially
and in the beginning in the morning
you're kind of CEO and you're trying to
align your workers to do the thing that
needs to be done
and so you need to tell yourself like
what is the thing I need to do for poker
to succeed now your other brain you can
say your emotional brain your creative
soft excuse searching brain is gonna try
to romanticize and persuade you to not
do the thing by saying are you don't
need to do this thing you're smarter
than that or you know uh you can do it
different or tomorrow or it hasn't it
doesn't need to be done necessarily
because there's this other thing you
need to prioritize right now you need to
call back this friend and whatever
so I think it is about understanding
that the path to success is oftentimes
very monotonous and just boring and
obvious and that's how business and
success works is to not be cute not
trying to be out not trying to be
smarter than you are and just
understanding you know what poker is all
about for example it's about solving a
lot of puzzles so you need to become
better at problem solving how do you do
that well you need to look at
problem-solving machines like solvers
like every day and you also need to
understand your opponents and how they
differ how they play different than the
solver so to analyze your opponents
which is monotonous just open their hand
histories click through take some notes
open the hands you played solve so so
solve understand the solves that's it
now you that is the job that you would
give someone if it is a business you do
one hour of this one hour of that and
you take down notes that is the job now
your other brain is trying to be cute
about it and now you have to do it like
differently you have to become creative
you have to change the task you find
exclusive basically to make the whole
thing more sexy more sexy to you
basically trying to be cute I think
that's where the where the pitfall is
and it is because your incentives are
not aligned like you are the same person
that is trying to run the business as
the worker that is just executing on the
lower level and that's has to be
extremely aligned in order to work out
well
and oftentimes we're not because we're
just one person so I think looking at it
from the outside perspective and saying
okay look I'm gonna do this monotonous
task for one hour then the other
monotonous tasks and sometimes there
will be exciting less exciting Etc but
I'm just gonna do this test for one hour
then this test for one hour and then I'm
gonna grind for four hours that is a job
now your private personal desires might
be your personal desires might be yeah
but I also want to have fun I also want
to exercise I also want to have
connection I also want to watch my TV
show and so on sure
that kind of that level of enjoyment is
something that you have to that you can
put someone else somewhere else outside
of your workday
but don't look for it it doesn't need to
happen in your work day and I think
that's the problem of poker players to
say like well if my work day wasn't as
much fun as I wanted it to be then I
need to change my routine I need to
change the thing that is going to get me
to success no you don't because some
days are going to be just like they are
and you're still going to do the thing
and if you want to have a little bit of
fun then do it at the end of the day
after you have worked but that
separation between what your workplace
should offer you versus what all the
things you want to have in your life I
think that a lot of people lose that
perspective they think poker needs to
take all the boxes at every time every
day and that's not going to happen
um yeah I like the perspective as well
as understand like you're a one-man
business when you're talking about
business I'm fully relating to a poker
player you are the business you're the
planner you're the doer you're the
executor and I think it's really
important to realize that you're trying
to get outcomes no matter what you're
doing and there's a system that you can
design that can get you to those
outcomes so the first thing you're going
to do is design the system you've got to
step away from the kind of doing a
day-to-day and go right what system do I
need in terms of my habits routines
patterns skills to learn that gets me to
that outcome then you've got the next
job you're an Executor you're also shown
up to work you know it's the planning
guy and puts it to somebody else's work
pile you don't need to show up and
execute and now as you mentioned when
you're trying to execute very often
emotions come up these kind of
short-term players of the the mind
trying to get us to take the path of
least resistance and almost like the
Joker in the deck who's almost like whoa
it will take a it's easy here so it's
it's to learn both those skills to
design the system and then execute the
system so let's say someone develops
these skills they are able to use their
willpower they're able to discipline
themselves because the incentives are
clear and also the intentions clear I
think the intention is very important
because often when I speak to before
players on one-on-one sessions and they
stopped doing something and almost
always when I really dig deeper and I'm
going what was the intention like going
into this behavior and very often the
intentions drifted out of sight it's
like oh I wasn't really thinking about
that at the moment I just didn't really
think I thought I would be able to do
that and they lost track of the
intention which is the kind of driver
behind the action and then the the
behavior got sidetracked with emotions
or other things in the day so let's say
someone's developed that skill because I
really prepared for you what you've
developed so many skills that you kind
of Leverage for other things so I'd say
you've been able to use your kind of
logic and reason to make Forward Motion
so to take the next action that moves
towards your goals in spite of emotions
pulling on you what are some of the
other skills players need to be learning
develop alongside it to make sure
they're moving towards their poker goals
and achieving the big objectives of
winning the game of Pokemon
I would really Circle it back to so
let's say
you usually like in business you get
paid for the the the magnitude or the
size of the problem you solve right and
in poker it's in some ways kind of
similar because
back in the days I mean there are other
there are other factors that play into
it like market conditions so on but back
in the days solving prob solving poker
problems or solving poker you can say
without a solver is actually pretty
difficult but some people were really
good at it and they got paid a lot of
money to do that so solving
poker before a solver was out there was
well paid and it was a highly sucked
skill
nowadays solving poker is like
I mean a monkey could do it because you
just press the button on the software
and it solves actually poker that's like
how technology has evolved right now so
you as a poker player you start having
to shift yours the skills that you're
working on in order to differentiate
yourself from the other monkeys you can
say so everyone is like learning these
Sims right everyone is opening GTO
wizard everyone is doing that sure you
need to do it as well but that's not
going to differentiate you from the next
guy who's doing that the next
professional player is doing it so sure
you need to you need to understand the
the in and outs of the Sims and and how
your opponents are playing but what's
the differentiating factor like what can
you solve for that they can't and I
would say it's understanding
where the edges are in the market so for
example
last year I moved from Switzerland to
Vegas and what I've learned the first
thing I learned is that poker in America
is great online in life because people
are pretty bad they're not as educated
as these freaking Europeans Europeans
are die-hard people in poker like they
just they are good they're good and also
the the rate condition and environment
in general is less conducive to making
money
so if you have a certain skill set and
you're good at it ask yourself
what other skills have I not worked on
that much that actually lead to much
more output than the the path I took so
far and for a lot of people it means
just like understanding the market the
environment are in much much better
there are a lot of games right now
there are a lot of games right now where
either it's not worth your time because
the rake is too high it's not worth your
time because the format is too fragile
like it's going to die out it's not
worthwhile because there's too much
cheating collusion or it's not
worthwhile because there's too much
competition in it that is like I usually
tell people like in I don't know
coaching conversations are similar there
are many ways to fail at poker and only
few to win and it used to be different
you can just hop on any poker side and
just win and just be like if you have
half a brain you just win in some ways
like just make money now it's the
opposite so now you need to understand
what are the traps in poker and what are
the opportunities in poker that's a true
skill set to differentiate between those
two and the first point of reference is
data so why why is data important
because
if if you understand data you understand
how many whales are playing on the
tables you usually play at what is the
rake that you're paying and what's the
edge in between
uh
you understand your Edge a lot better in
in in comparison to your opponents if
you understand how they play in which
spots they play different than you and
why that is a mistake you have data to
prove that you have an edge in that game
a lot of players that just played
blindly they really don't pay a lot of
attention to data data means all their
hints they have played all the hands
that they have stored about their
opponents about the environment all the
information they have available The Rake
structures of the poker sites the shark
scope like if you go to shark scope you
can see for example how many people have
made a million dollars last year playing
poker two hundred thousand three hundred
thousand four hundred thousand dollars
that are tracked on shark scope and made
that kind of money uh how did they do it
what tournaments did they play what is
their schedule buying level Roi history
before you can get data on all these all
these um well data points basically in
order to have more informed decisions
about where you want to put in your
attention and effort
so the the first skill set would be to
understand how to interpret data and get
your hold of it in order to find the
differentiating factor between what most
people are doing in poker which is just
like learning strategy and applying it
wherever is convenient versus really
thinking it through and thinking what
skill set makes sense to apply in which
kind of environment moving moving
forward the general just the second
skill set is the general system second
skill set is basically to understand
that opportunity and difficulty are
linked to each other so you don't
necessarily want to pursue something
that is extremely difficult to do right
so for example in business if you start
your first business should it be
launching Rockets into the sky like no
like maybe it could be profitable but it
is way too hard it is way too hard it's
not worth the effort
um to do it so maybe you should do
something that is a little bit simpler
and in poker there are many small
elements of that that that are true as
well for example should you learn how to
play 200 big blinds deep 300 big blinds
deep should you learn how to play heads
up and six max they're so like should
you learn multiple Bed sizings On Any
Given Street should you learn XYZ like
you should ask yourself really like what
are you trying to specialize in and what
is worth about my time in order to
achieve my goal and then pin it down and
say this is this is where I'm going to
exist within the poker realm and and
then nail that and oftentimes if you're
currently in an environment where it
feels it's really really tough to win
even though you're giving it your all
you're probably like you're probably not
the problem it is the environment you
chose that is the problem to succeed you
want to be in an environment where it's
like I I'm working hard but this is this
is working really well like this is this
is going really well like I'm getting a
lot of rewards for what I'm doing here
and and I can see a future that is even
better right and that's hard to find but
it is a disproportional payoff versus
just going into this is really hard but
I just need to work even harder and then
maybe one day it will become easy no it
won't because you're in the wrong
environment
um
let's say if somebody has looked around
the market and they decided that they're
going to play a certain format let's say
they've got maybe stuck at midsticks 100
NL 200 NL and they're really passionate
about making high sticks they want to
really move sticks maybe get some pride
in themselves as I mentioned towards
that Pride Avenue of self-achievements
but it's really tough and they're really
really grinding hard and they want to
the pursuit is clear I want to make Thai
sticks but I'm currently stuck at
midsticks and It's a Grind it's a slog
and the only way I kind of I can see out
is to work harder and to perfect my
skill sets would you recommend to that
person let's say they didn't mind the
working hard they say they're young 21
22 they don't mind the kind of slog in
the grinds would you say that person
should reflect on whether it's worth the
effort of putting in the extra effort at
this stage or do you feel like this
person should double down on skills and
if you should Double Down skills what
skills should this person be trying to
acquire
I'd say for most people like they're
overvalued this idea of discipline
working hard as something that has a
they think at the end of the rainbow
they're going to have this amazing
payoff and feeling of like I am you know
I work really hard you know it's like
the David Goggins analogy it's like okay
David Goggins works really hard every
single day
but do you want to be David Goggins like
do you want to suffer every day for what
exactly like for the pride you feel
afterwards
if you had a child do you want that
child to be like Goggins or to be
someone that is enduring suffering every
day for character building traits and I
would say you need some suffering and
hardness in life but not to that degree
what I would wish for my child and the
reason I'm using the analogy of a child
is because it's oftentimes the best way
to think about giving advice to yourself
because you usually are Kinder about
thinking about your child than yourself
so if I think about my child I would say
I want my child to obviously have
discipline and and work towards
something worthwhile and so on but I
also want my child to have it in some
ways better than me by being smarter
about life decisions and the way you're
smarter is by sometimes thinking about
what is
what what is a
the path of of least resistance right
like there there is another quote by I
think I'm not sure who said that maybe
it was Steve Jobs or something but he
said like I want to have lazy developers
or something along those lines and the
reason he said that is because he said
if you have lazy workers they're going
to find the fastest way to do something
because they're lazy they're not going
to be tryhards and trying the most
complex most energy draining way to do
something they're going to be thinking
longer about what can how can I preserve
as much energy as possible to get to my
goal and oftentimes if you surround
yourself by people that think more about
how to shortcut things versus just work
work work work work you end up in a much
more
in a much bigger payoff and feeling
better as well about it because you work
less hard than other people but your
payoff is bigger because you leverage
certain ideas you look behind uh what
was the obvious one at the front
so I'd say that
for most people even if they think oh
I'm priding myself in the fact that I'm
working hard I would I would much more
pride myself in Taking Chances and risks
um in order to have a disproportional
payoff versus working hard so what's the
what's the difference
someone that takes risk in order to
achieve their dreams they might move a
country they might message a person like
hey I saw you are playing 10 times as
high as me I want to be your Prodigy
where do I need to move I'm going to
play for you I'm going to give you 50 of
my winnings I'm going to do whatever is
necessary so I can make the money you
make in two three years I'm going to
take the risk to do that like that's
someone that is taking risk for this
proportional payoff
if you are grinding 16 hour days at home
playing NL 100 that is someone that is
just working hard but is not really
going to get anywhere basically it's
just it is I mean
there's no element of Leverage in that
approach that is going to create the
disproportional jump
in in in that history basically so I
wouldn't want that for anyone basically
that is uh is looking for good success
um yeah I think it's also a culturally
built into us to uh kind of correlate
hard work and effort with success and
achieving things and we're often sold on
the dream that if we work harder if the
harder we work and we find a way to work
as hard as possible we'll finally get to
the end of the rainbow and the pot of
gold that we deserve but as you've
talked about like there's much more
strategic better ways to think about
calculated risk I think the way you want
to start is much more like a calculated
risk to a high payoff so if someone's
working really hard and the payoff is
huge at the end of it they could set
themselves up for the future it could be
a massive uh growth path in the end of
it then maybe the effort was worth it
but it was your describing it very often
people are just beating their heads
against the wall for not really much of
an upside and the effort is not really
validated so I say for those people
because generally people who are able to
work hard is a skill in itself it's a
very good skill if you can direct that
in an Avenue that correlates with what
Fernando said about a good risk
opportunity team so Thai risk and
potential High reward and you put your
time and energy in that and use your
work ethic to outwork other people
around you you're on to win a formula
see I think those people have got that
kind of that's a fine tried because of
the the identity is built and working
hard myself I had this for a long time I
did Supernova Elite volume three years
in a row and I built them I said I work
hard I'm a grinder I was bragging to my
friends how many games I played in a day
and a year absolutely pathetic looking
back
my self-identity is built around how
hard I work and I feel good about it I
feel a self of sense of self-worth if I
had a day off and did like nothing to
sort of speak I'd be like Adam you're a
loser you're not doing enough you need
to step it up you know I think culture
sometimes we get that built into us that
we are linked to our effort that we put
in if you have a lot of success in your
kind of cruising people are like step it
up do a bit more do you deserve what you
get see I think it's a narrative you
need to work on you need to find a way
to uh disincentivize working hard and
more being smart as you mentioned I
think it's all about this kind of small
thinking and being more strategic what I
like about you is you've almost got this
like real zoomed out lens and you see
the bigger game there's a big game going
on and we can choose all the sub games
to play inside a bit I think often we
get so dragged into little sub games and
we play them all out not realize them
should have been playing that game was
that the game for you really or should
you took a step back and pick a
different game so uh for yourself as
you've started to um
game of wisdom which I definitely think
you've got a lot of how has that changed
how you've judged the games you should
be playing alright so right now you've
got coaching you've got plain high
stakes like you said to move to Vegas to
uh take advantage of the higher Stakes
games there how has your kind of with
the way you assess opportunities in the
pocket landscape changed as you've
gained more knowledge
the interesting part about my story and
probably some poker players can relate
that have a secondary income stream or
in my case it's more like a primary
income stream is that your when you play
poker you're trying to find The Sweet
Spot of making the kind of money playing
the kind of money that is interesting to
your bottom line so like do your entire
net worth so let's say for example you
have a hundred million dollars and
you're trying to play poker for a living
if you make a thousand dollars that day
like it doesn't it is not going to be
fun like you can't try hard if you don't
need the money basically that's really
the gist of it and I remember actually
an interview with ben86 many years ago
where he said why doesn't he play 2550
PLO and because he was playing like 50
500 501 000 against isilder heads up
and why wouldn't you just go for like on
off days of time play a quarter 50 PLO
online to go for the quote-unquote easy
money and his answer was it really sucks
to play a game where your opponents are
trying a hundred times harder than you
to win the same amount of money and
that's basically what happens there
because there's a disalignment between
his effort and the payoff in the real
world like he
can make you can play a 10K part but if
he has played hundreds of thousands of
dollar swings in the last day and earned
millions of dollars playing poker
you're not playing with the same weapons
at that point against your opponents so
in my case
I was playing poker from 2011 until
you can say 2018 specifically like quite
heavily and I would make a in I would
say on average like 200 000 a year
sometimes more sometimes a little bit
less it depends a little bit on if I
would win a tournament or if I play Live
or something like that basically but
that would be like the earning range so
to speak and if you make 200k a year in
most countries like you have a good life
and it's going to pay all your bills as
you as I started venturing out into
business it'd be it became less
interesting to like uh first of all I
wouldn't have the capacity to work the
same amount of hours on poker
and if I would have less capacity and
less volume to play poker I couldn't
even earn the 200k but I would earn Less
in either smaller Stakes games or the
same state games but less volume and now
there's a disalignment happening because
the more successful your business
becomes the less interesting it becomes
to even grind for
200 an hour for example 100 an hour like
what's the point of even doing that if
your business is going really well at
the same time because I'm a poker player
and that's the level Adam and I
discussed privately there is a desire to
continue playing poker because it's an
identity I was and been a professional
poker player for most of my life so the
the the most natural thing for me to do
when I want to feel productive is to
play poker but it might not be in the
right environment that is
that is congruent with what I'm trying
to achieve by playing poker so playing
poker can be like uh it can be a
distraction
to doing the thing that you actually
want to do so for me it really became
about understanding when does it make
sense for me to play poker given my
skill set and given the financial output
that I'm looking to get through poker
and either I have to be like hey look if
I I can only play this volume in these
Stakes to be consistent winner and
therefore I'm gonna be happy making that
kind of money and hourly playing poker
and I'm still gonna grind it which is
really hard to do because it almost
makes no sense basically
then either that would be one pathway
which I couldn't I couldn't do that or
I'm gonna seek out games where I can
leverage my ability to travel my ability
to play High games because of my
financial status like I have enough
money to play the game and you know
maybe even my image as a good player or
a coach to get more action or get paid
off so nowadays like the way I like to
play poker the most is I'm traveling to
different places I'm playing live poker
I'm playing high Stakes or sometimes
super high stakes poker in
environments that are difficult for the
best the hardest working poker player to
even reach because they're not going to
travel there they're not going to get
into the game they're not going to be
there they're not going to be able to
afford the game whatever it could be for
different reasons that I can get into
the game and that's kind of like my
focus as a from a poker player's
perspective right now I mean I'm in
Barcelona I'm gonna go to the Kingston
afterwards and travel to Vegas
afterwards so I'm playing like in pretty
good games in all those areas where I
can leverage my position
but it doesn't make sense for me to be
like grinding online mistakes and trying
to
make the needle go anyway basically
that's just going to be a an exhausting
exercise so that that also takes
discipline and perspective in a zoom out
lens in order to even understand this is
how poker fits into my life and I mean
we've been working on this for many many
many hours and it's difficult it's very
challenging yeah especially when your
identity is really tied to what you do
it becomes challenging to just almost
like zoom out and say what the edge
opportunities are what the kind of
things you're trying to get from that
intrinsically in terms of playing the
game and even accidentally well the
external kind of metrics you're trying
to get from it when our identities in a
time with that sometimes becomes quite
challenging so I'm curious for you
because you mentioned in the
questionnaire we sent you that longevity
is one of the things you're most proud
of and your ability to reinvent yourself
and I think a lot of players struggle
with reinvention I think a lot of people
get very stuck in a certain identity in
certain modes so I'm wondering first of
all what are some of the bigger
reinventions you've had to make and how
have you been able to uh kind of shift
your how you view yourself and your
identity as you've moved through your
career
one of the biggest challenges for poker
players is is is they're underestimating
how long they have been in poker and how
many hours went into it so they're very
they're very specialized and also
they're a huge expert in this one field
when you are a poker player and you want
to start a business for example a poker
coaching business you have some big
advantages because you know the industry
but you also have some some uh some some
hard moments to grind through because
you're also a complete beginner in
business in many ways but the
expectation is that you are already a
certain point in Korea so you want to be
high performer you want you want things
to work you have a certain expectation
of what's going to happen and it
probably won't happen in the beginning
of the of the business career so for
example if you're a poker player and you
make x amount of hourly once you start
venturing out you're not going to make
that hourly you're going to make
probably zero dollars and for for a
while and that has to be completely okay
if you understand the bigger Vision
behind it and the skills you're going to
learn are going to feel very Rusty in
the beginning because you're a complete
Noob you're going to learn about things
that you that are not fun because you're
bad at it and they've never heard before
and it's going to be a tough ride and I
and I usually like I tell people like if
you have a poker career and a second
career
don't expect like don't think that the
second career has to be as profitable as
the first career right away it will not
be this way like it it because you're a
beginner in this other career even if
it's linked to Poker even it's poker
coaching or something like that you
first have to build up the experience
and the knowledge that you have built up
as a poker player which were through
many many many years
so I think that's a
that is a is a is a big lessons there
are a lot of skill sets you need to
learn in business that are very foreign
to poker players and a lot of them are
connected also to responsibility and
scheduling and and and planning out
working with others understanding
product development understanding
understanding what people want in poker
like what what your customers want
overall like there are a lot of things
that will feel very different for
example business is all about decisions
that are panning out slowly so you make
a decision and it will take weeks or
months sometimes for the decision to
really show its effect
in poker you make decisions you get
immediate feedback and something is
about to happen
so business is a lot slower in that way
but I think it can also be more
rewarding kind of for the same reason
because it's a less reactionary game and
it's more a game of making good
long-term investment and decisions into
certain alleys that you're sort of
paying into you're building up something
and then as you're building up something
it becomes more and more and more and
more worth which is something that is
completely it's almost inexistent in
poker like the idea of having an asset
is not existent in poker and asset as as
far as like a physical thing it could
also be an online website course
customer based team it could be a
software or something I mean these are
all things that we have built throughout
the years is is completely foreign as a
poker player but it can be very very
rewarding and I think what a lot of
poker players don't necessarily
understand is like they think why is a
poker player going into coaching and
it's a complete misunderstanding of of
the poker coaching industry so so if
you're a poker player and you know how
to make a hundred dollars an hour for
example you have that skill set
that skill set might be worth
a hundred two hundred thousand dollars a
year something along those lines because
you also have to study and while you
study you make zero dollars so you study
and you play while you play you make a
hundred dollars maybe per year you make
150k let's say something along those
lines now if you can teach 500 people
how to make a hundred dollars an hour or
even fifty dollars an hour and they pay
you a hundred dollars let's say then you
have a six hundred thousand dollar
business if you have 500 customers if
you have 250 customers but you double
the price you have another six hundred
thousand dollar business and that kind
of business that you have there let's
say half a million dollar business is a
business that is going to have no swings
you're not going to have a losing days
and also you will consistently build up
towards having an asset so at some point
you're gonna have to make less videos
you're going to have maybe better
methods of acquiring new customers you
might have like external coaches that
work for you Etc et cetera you're having
a real asset to build towards and that
all comes from the initial skill set of
learning how to make a hundred dollars
an hour so suddenly you leverage that
skill set by having taught the skill set
to hundreds of people and now you have
an asset so you don't need to tell
thought you don't need to coach people
anymore at this point but they can learn
from your past videos and now suddenly
you're leveraging past videos reputation
Etc and customer base into a long-term
asset and maybe through that you have
synergic businesses like in my case I
have like an ambassador a ship with GG
poker I have an affiliate business that
runs behind as well
so if you use synergetic business models
alongside it then you have what I would
call a flywheel so you start attaching
more and more things to your synergetic
business model and it comes becomes
faster and faster and faster and
suddenly you have six seven income
streams that are all stumbling from this
one skills that you had initially which
was knowing how to make a hundred
dollars per hour and suddenly you're
making like way more than that based on
the assets you have built so I think
that's the appeal generally speaking to
get into coaching or business in general
from your initial skill set and it's
completely misunderstood by poker
players like they they think oh if you
don't know how to make 100K anymore
you're going to start teaching and
you're going to make a 100K like it's
not really
it's not really that
um
in that landscape what I really like
about your story and what we're sharing
There is almost like the unlimited
opportunities where the Pokemon can make
available and I think a lot of players
start now might not be as far ahead as
you've been in the game a long time
since 2006 you've reinvented yourself a
lot of times but I think you're a great
example of staying in the game and
reinvent yourself around what's
available and pivot in when things have
become available and see what's
available from that lens and for you
obviously you've started out as a full
player playing full time like a lot of
players will just be sold income playing
poker you're grinding grinder grinder
but the same time I think what you do a
better job of than almost all players
I've spoke with is you're always in a
step back to look around what else is
available what other opportunities are
on my landscape what are the games can I
be playing I think for some players they
might have no idea to basically playing
poker leverage in one skill set but I
think you're a great example of what can
come further down the line and think
this hopefully this this podcast episode
will encourage some players to think a
bit bigger think a bit outside of the
lens of just one one skill set one
format and think fail in the future
where do you want to be and how could
you potentially leverage the skills that
you're developing now interested Avenues
in the future that may be coaching with
other things it may be starting your
business maybe anything but for most
popular players they're probably going
to Pivot at some point out of Poker and
I think it's really good to go right how
can I leverage all this time and energy
into what I'm doing but also in the
future I can use that for something else
because I've spoke with many players
who've kind of felt trapped in poker and
they're almost like I put so much time
into it so much energy I've literally
slogged away and all I can do now is
play poker because my skills are useless
elsewhere and it's always such a real
like disconnect between how valuable the
skills you currently have are and how
there's a pivot just to the side of you
that you're not seeing which you could
use your skill set you're in leverage
not not super easy like I said like
Leverage into another kind of business
or an idea generally you drop income
quite a lot in the short term but you
can leverage that skill set I always
feel like a little bit sorry for players
and a bit sad when I when I hear players
go I'm stuck I've got no nothing to give
to the world apart from play poker and
I'm saying right you just need to change
the way you're looking at things because
as you've mentioned being a poker player
you also will likely be very very good
at all the things you have opportunities
Galore if you've managed to beat
mistakes online wow you're a sick kind
of individual your mind is great at
problem solving you can leverage that
into lots of different things so yeah
anyone who is listening who's like full
Grind Mode full leverage in one skill a
Booker and all those other news in the
future which hopefully Fernando will
encourage you guys to explore just one
one tip of that to like finish up that
thought if you are currently you feel
like you're stuck in poker best thing
you can do is first of all don't tell
yourself we're stuck in poker because
you're going to stay stuck if you tell
yourself you're stuck in poker but also
the second thing is just consume like
what holds you back between where you
are right now and your next career or or
a side gig is skills you don't have the
skills okay so what that's not a big
problem you can learn skills so what you
want to do is you want to learn skills
and you can get inspired by listening to
a lot of podcasts outside of the poker
industry you know just like listen to a
bunch of podcasts within business within
different avenues that you might be
interested in anyway it could be Sports
Nutrition business it could be crypto
finances whatever it could be but listen
to podcasts so that you can hear other
voices and then through that you become
probably interested in some Fields like
you personally think oh this is a field
that is interesting to me and start
thinking what are skills that I need to
acquire to succeed in that field and how
can I get to those skills similar to
Poker you hire a coach you get into a
course you join a group a Discord
Channel whatever it could be but
basically the only thing that holds you
back is skills and they are as easy
acquirable as ever right now with the
whole online landscape so
it doesn't have to happen overnight but
start consuming different information
and look into different Avenues to
diversify your skill set and and the
faster you know it you know a year has
passed by and you know a lot more about
a certain area and you start making some
moves
um yeah it reminds me of Alexa Mosey
who's a great business coach he talks
about kind of three things only three
things in the way of any goal the first
one is your beliefs what you believe is
possible if you believe it's not
possible you're not going to get off the
start line and move forward so we need
to uh believe that something's possible
in terms of Avenue next one is skills
acquiring skills over time to achieve
that objective and the third one which
kind of reinforces the skill learning is
character traits What identity character
traits do I need to form so I can
develop those skills consistently over
time towards that objective that's it
beliefs character traits skills and if
you get those three together and also
when you're trying to achieve a goal
I'll be honest with yourself which one
we're missing do I believe it's possible
have I got the skills and acquired them
and where am I where's my leaks in this
kind of kind of pyramids towards success
but I really really good I think it's a
it's a really powerful mindset because
if you're just missing skills you can
acquire them if you're defect in your
personality or you're not smart enough
that's pretty hard to bridge but it's
just a skill all right skills I can
learn skills that's something I've done
in the past if you're a poker player and
you think you can't learn skills
re-examine all the things you've learned
throughout your career because you're a
skill learner machine so yeah I think
it's a really positive lens for his do
it

in your poker career but for now without
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode
hey everybody I'm interested in yourself
as well you've had a long career
longevity what have been some of the key
character traits that you've developed
or instilled yourself that have allowed
you to uh continue to engage with
program over the years
I think a lot of what Fernando also said
like Reinventing yourself and adapting
and not staying stuck in a rigid way of
thinking like throughout I mean online
poker is an ever-changing landscape I
mainly stuck to the online poker world
how do I actually have been playing I
have actually played live poker this
summer in the first time in many many
years and I can indeed confirm with
Fernando said definitely a lot softer
than than the online streets and you can
also see the online streets you know Buy
in indeed what Fernandez is that
tracking data you can see that for
example the average win rate of Iraq in
the last four years yeah it has declined
significantly so these are signs that
maybe you should look for a different
environment if you want to make a lot of
money or you can indeed double down and
try to improve your skills to still
succeed in the same environment but
indeed maybe changing environment is the
smarter solution I would say I was going
to say easier solution uh but it's
smarter solution and that's it's funny a
lot of the what we're talking about I
noticed that I have a lot of
uh indeed these beliefs as well in my
head of like exactly just going there
the easier money there's something that
feels it feels
there's there's some resistance there
and that resistance indeed like the
pride that you get right from uh
doubling down and working harder and it
it it it has something it's really
stupid rationally right wrestling makes
a lot of sense but I do feel there's
there's a disconnect here between what
my brain thinks but all the knowledge is
shared and what what my what what my
belly thinks or however you want to call
it there's there's definitely some
disconnect there but yeah over the years
definitely changed a lot for example as
Fernando also said pre-solver you needed
different skills extra skills that I was
very good at uh and then post solver you
needed different skills I was always in
the team as well if something came out I
immediately start using it doesn't
matter what what oh wasting all these
hours arguing about what they think
about it I don't care what my opinion is
about this software coming out doesn't
matter everyone's going to use I have to
use it so I have to find a way to best
use it what I think about it I'm not
gonna waste energy and cry about
something coming out oh no AI is there
oh AI is there how can I use it because
everyone's going to use it so how can I
use is it better and and how to get in
that so I think that mentality
kind of like the adapter time mentality
that I think is is definitely part of
why I'm still around and I always look
for new people as well for example the
people that have done strategy with they
keep on changing as well I keep on
reaching out to new people the people I
do Shred with it nowadays and the way I
approach poker strategy also changed I'm
not stuck in my old beliefs I'm seeing
new people do new stuff I'm always
open-minded I think being open-minded
is the key to keep on growing it's funny
actually that you mentioned uh or mostly
there I think Fernando also not not a
Hermosa literally last night watched the
seminar that he gave about money where
he literally talks about everything that
we just talked about he talks about
their people what is work that the thing
is literally the first thing they
started that Define work and then he
comes with the traditional definition
but he then talks a lot about leverage
oh and how do you skill it's very very
interesting very interesting uh seminar
so I thought it was I was like I'm
listening to a repeat of what I listened
to last night so yeah I mean Fernandez
giving the same with my uh advices for
MOSI we're we're we have some good
information on our hands he also he
lives in Vegas as well right now and
sometimes I see him in different
restaurants where I'm also like going
and I was on a call actually with his
wife Leila hermosi because they have a
business model acquisition.com where
they acquire basically equity in your
firm and they have an interest
proposition they say we're going to
Triple your business slash your Revenue
in your business within I think they say
we're gonna 3x your business in
two years and if we don't achieve that
we're going to give you back the equity
that we bought for the cash without
asking back for the cash and you
basically free rolled our entire
expertise in back office that they're
providing to your business so I I went
on a call with Leila Hermos in her and
her team from acquisition.com
because I was interested to see what
they can do for my business
and in the beginning of the call she
said well your business is currently
located in Switzerland so it's not part
of the uh it's not it's it's out of
question that we cannot invest in it
because we're not going to buy equity in
companies that are outside of the US but
because we're already on a call we're
going to give you 20 minutes time to
just pick our brains for your business
and so on and in those 20 minutes I
learned more than like in hundreds of
hours of anything else that I did which
was absolutely incredible like how well
they understood the market of coaching
online even though they have no idea
about poker because they have just
skimmed through hundreds of businesses
and know so many business owners that
run different educational platforms
online I learned so much in those 20
minutes for free it was invaluable and
it just shows again like if you reach
out trying to make some moves you'll
learn some things along the way but
sometimes even for free so it was a
super interesting and we do I mean we
both listen to Alex uh because it's
great advice and it's for free
anyone interested in Business Marketing
sales
hormones stuff for free and like by far
far by far the best advice out there
when you see me in the restaurant you
order them a dessert he's like hashtag
never skip dessert hashtag never used
the stairs like guys the guy is super in
shape always takes desserts never takes
the stairs
what's interesting to me is like I've
been following as we discussed before
the before this recording I've been
following the brand mechanics of Poker
uh since the beginning and watched your
uh your podcast early on as well like
what is your guys experience with
transitioning from poker playing into
like stable but also business side of
things for yourself like how was the
because on this podcast we usually hear
from the guests but I'm also interested
in like what was your journey in the
last couple of years like building up
this brand and the product line behind
it as well
that's that's quite a quite quite an
adventure I can tell you so basically I
I switched to a cfp model coaching for
profit when I was at the peak of my
career
both I think two two main reasons one I
I had that thing that everyone has when
they reached success you're at the top
and you're like ah I thought it would
feel better so I guess I was like maybe
I should do different than I always had
the idea of coaching uh I really like
making content for example with my with
my study partners I would prepare like
presentation and present my ideas to
them I really like that that aspect and
I don't know anymore who I got
influenced by at that moment but I was
also already thinking about in terms of
skill like I'm always trading my time
for money I think I don't know who came
with that at that point but that was the
main phrase of him I'm still training my
time for money how can I scale this so I
figured well exactly what you said if I
know how to make a lot of money we're
playing poker if I teach that to others
then I can skill without and but this
was kind of a flood I did I was like
without having to do the hours oh guess
what uh the passive income yeah that was
kind of the best income trap so
yeah that definitely was not passive but
this was also due to my in hindsight I
think I used the cfp
to justify me diving into the rabbit
hole of poker strategy I would say that
is actually what has happened uh I would
now do it in a different way but
basically I had them I really loved
studying I still love studying the game
of poker and basically now I had
students who were paying me to study the
game of poker so I found a way that I
could I think there was another thing
that got influenced by they said try to
find something that you love to do and
try to find a way to get paid doing what
you love to do and I loved studying
playing poker more than playing poker so
I was like well if I get students they
pay me to study the game and come up
with strategies and stuff and then I
explained it to my students and they
execute that's a way that I can get paid
doing what I love to do which is develop
poker strategies so I started doing that
and I think at some point we had like 20
students
and we were doing it mainly live in
location and I was looking like the next
step then is skill further right you're
gonna skill online
um
but I did also at some point start to
notice a lot of resistance in terms of
what I was doing and what I actually
wanted to do I actually missed really
having time for myself and having time
playing poker myself so then at that
point I was like do I really want to
continue down the cfp and business route
because in order to skill cfp
you also for example you need to set up
good affiliate use you have to load up
more people in in in like the lower
skills the 10nls the 25 NLS and in my
calculations it was kind of a trap for a
lot of the low stakes players it's very
hard to be on a cfp and grind your way
out so basically the cfp model just
loads up a lot of layers on the bottom
they're fine with them just grinding 50
and L you know it's just another number
in your business that's fine and I guess
the guys who run good they can
outperform the profit share and
therefore they can reach a higher higher
level and I don't know it's not
something that I was intrinsically
motivated for like all the students that
I had the goal was this and we're going
to try to become the best in the world
and scaling that model it gave me would
give me a lot of job and tasks that I
just did not want to do I mean you
talked about this sometimes you need to
do Facebook don't want to do but is like
like oh you pay someone to do it yes so
I did I did also start to hire people
and work with other people in business
uh obviously yeah you learn a lot there
as well I also I had business partners
uh with some you know I parted ways at
some point and right now I don't have
any employees I mean I work together
with Adam but I was growing and growing
the business then at some point also
so at some point I then transitioned the
cfp to the mechanics of Poker which I
did because it freed up a bit more time
for me I kind of have the quality of a
cfp program I have the proven results of
cfp program but we put it more in like a
course type of model so I figured at
that moment for me it was the best of
both worlds because I did enjoy the
content I had all this content so also
from a financial perspective I have all
this course I have all this content on
the uh on the planks better I put that
out there
and then I started the skill we also uh
for I think one year opened like the
poker ambition Academy before that was
also poker ambition now it's only the
mechanics of Poker thanks to Alex
hermosi by the way it was one of The
Inspirations for the Rebrand uh
so basically then we started to also
give webinars to lower Stakes we tried
to increase the amount of products that
we offer but if you increase the amount
of products you offer you need a bigger
team bigger team meets more cost me to
more headaches more people to
communicate with me
and then at some point I noticed that I
was
doing work no I was creating more work
and creating more products not
necessarily for myself but for my
employees to have a job so I wasn't
paying them for nothing that was really
a wake-up call for me I think I had two
calls with two people that one really
really asked me the question like what
does in this case was poker Mission what
does this business offer you what do you
want out of it out of your life and then
I realized that what it was giving me at
that moment was not what I wanted
because I was spending a lot of time on
it I was no longer very motivated to do
it it gave me a lot of stress in order
to grow it further more more headaches
and just just the fact of scaling it it
wasn't really making me happy so then at
some point I actually got got the book
from hermosi the the first one that he
read the honeymoon offers wrote that
don't don't everything rebranded the
whole thing doubled down on one program
mechanics of poker rebranded the whole
thing and now I would say it's
I work way less make way more money so
in terms of that progress that that has
been going well uh obviously you can
scale it further but this was another
thing of another call that with a friend
of mine who said listen you always have
the mindset of everything can be
improved everything can be better you
can find a solution to everything and I
will basically not quit okay
but he said to what cost
who are you trying to prove that you can
make poker ambition a success and and
skilled as big as for example your
coaching company or an upswing broker or
something like that he said you can do
it but how how much effort will it cost
and when you reach it is it then still
considered a win or did you just do it
to prove to yourself that you could do
it
and I was like hmm
interesting I never questioned my my own
thought about like
I I never questioned that mindset to
sometimes be in the way of
your fluffy word your happiness or your
satisfaction or how or that the fact
that you live a nice day-to-day life
right so that was another very big
wake-up call that helped me decide on
basically stopping what program patient
was doing and rebranding it completely
to the mechanics of poker now we have uh
the podcast actually you also wrote
something out is something that we
really enjoy doing it's it's a great
benefit like we get to New meet new
people I get to talk about poker and
gets to talk about my performance we all
get to do what we love to do and
obviously it's a great way of growing
our brand uh and then yeah monetize it
for example with the mechanics of Poker
coaching program shout out to the
program
um yeah and basically from here we have
further ideas how to scale it further
but I am way more conscious and it's a
it's a constant struggle of
yeah you can keep on playing that game
of growing and everything has to skill
but actually nowadays I'm a bit I've
taken a little bit of a step back from
that and try to be a bit more conscious
of what I'm trying to grow and what I'm
trying to skill and especially why
if that makes sense so that's uh us
that's got kind of the story and here we
are today I actually also had another
question for you because this is
something that that I personally uh
struggle with
um for example when you switch into
coaching
because for example I could now go full
into coaching for example which I did
during the cfp like one-on-one coaching
or poker coaching and you don't play
poker anymore
imposter syndrome sort of comes up or at
least something something similar you
lose a bit touch with what actually is
going on in the games and at some point
who are you to coach to tell someone
that you can coach someone while you're
you're not currently active at the games
that you say that people that you're
gonna help people to get to
did you did you experience any struggles
with that when you transition to Poker
or
yeah yeah yeah oh yeah I worked a year
straight with Jared tendler and the main
subject was imposter syndrome it was a
couple years ago and
um
now with my extremely old mind uh
reflecting on a couple years ago I would
say that
well I'll tell you a story so I started
doing a little bit of one-on-one
coaching in January of this year because
I was traveling to Thailand and I was
like I'm not sure what I'm gonna do
there
so let's get a job which is making
one-on-one coaching
so I got a bunch of people interested
and signed them up and jumped into some
calls and some of the players were five
card PLO players and five card is very
new and even though we do release the
solver and so on I wasn't as good at
five card so the guy sent me his
database and I'm like oh my God is the
learning curve is going to be massive to
like learn how to give this guy feedback
on a game I'm not that good at but I
know database analysis so I did a little
bit of analysis and so on and after
spending like six hours on this thing
without charging obviously because I'm
like this is my I'm gonna I coached this
guy for five hours and first album I
need to tell him something that he
doesn't know so I prepared myself for 56
hours going to the call and then before
the call I told myself you know what I'm
gonna tell this guy
that this is going to be the first and
last session we do because I can't teach
this game it cannot provide enough value
and this session is for free but I just
can't do it so we went on to the call
and I told them like listen this is the
first and only session we're going to do
it's for free I just can't do it like I
just don't think I can add enough value
because I don't even play five card that
much so we did like database analysis I
give them feedback on conceptual things
and after the session he was like this
was the best coaching I ever received
please don't stop please don't stop
let's continue the sessions and I'm like
I mean the thing is you don't know like
the way you overcome imposter syndrome
is not by what you tell yourself or your
non-customers it is what the customer
says if it's good or not and if you do
one-on-one coaching or group coaching
and they tell you you know what I
learned so much and my results are
improving
then you're doing your job which is not
being a player which is being a coach so
they are the judges and the more
feedback you get the clearer and more
objective is your is your self image as
well and again it shouldn't be by just
random people on the internet it should
be by your actual customers this was
helpful this was great this was amazing
and oftentimes if you take on the role
as a coaching poker a ton of it is not
the
a ton of the things you know are not
necessarily built up experiences from
playing it is doing more research than
your students because they don't have
time or don't take the time to do it so
for example if you dig into their
databases and they don't have the skill
set of a database analysis analysis and
you find leaks in their game and then
point them out to them you save them a
huge amount of time and you actually
worked on a slightly different skill set
than they are because they're all about
implementation and playing and you're
all about analyzing and giving feedback
so you're taking on different roles and
at the end of the day the customer is
the one that decide how much value you
provide it and that's how you should
judge yourself based on and you will
usually find that you know so much more
about the game than you thought you will
and you would and you can provide so
much more value than you thought you
would
um
and then automatically that sort of idea
of impossible just gets removed or
disappears by just the pure feedback you
get from from your customers
yeah way away that we usually also do it
I always give the guarantee with all all
the products I say listen if you didn't
like the product we we will pay back the
money this is this is a way that you
know I have the customers they decide
for themselves if they thought it was
valuable well since it happened once I
remember we always said no one ever
asked but it happened once that someone
wanted I think half half his money back
and yeah once over many years that's not
it's not it's not necessarily bad result
right obviously like maybe just my way
or Adam's way or both our ways of
coaching just didn't resonate with him
yeah you know uh this can happen but
there's also a very big difference with
being a poker coach and poker player
it's like the performance aspect of
Poker is very specific
um and someone can be a great performer
but a bad coach and a good coach but a
worse performer and a few like
especially if you spend a lot of time
coaching you get a bit Rusty in terms of
your actual performing in-game the many
hours you can concentrate uh and stuff
like that so it's yeah it's it's it's
it's it's it's quite an interesting
thing the way I tried to solve it I
tried to solve it uh both internally
right
but to be fair also still a very big
part externally uh so I'm I'm not yet
I'm not yet fully enlightened to to the
to the inner camp and I mean another
thing that I realized I'm curious what
you're perspective but the more I I
ventured into business started to have
to work together with other people the
more I actually started to miss being a
poker player I realized damn being a
poke player is great so
like I said I feel like right now I'm
very happy with that we positioned
ourselves or in this case talk for
myself we I position myself exactly in
The Sweet Spot I can do the amount of
coaching that I like to do I can do the
amount of poker poker strategy that we
like to do with the mechanics of Poker I
have the community there uh but I also
still have time to play poker myself so
I feel like right now I'm positioning
myself in in a sweet spot and I'm a bit
afraid that if I would skill it further
then it would mean okay I have to get
more people on the team so I'm a bit
hesitant I'm a bit I'm a bit in the
comfort zone at the moment I would say
sounds like you want a change
like I I I I there are a lot of growing
pains in like acquiring new skills
especially like business and uh and
um another great
business content creator that I followed
over the years he doesn't make a lot of
content anymore is Sam Owens not sure if
you know him he's the only
consulting.com and yeah I mean
consulting.com is an excellent course
but apart from that is a great business
mind and he he taught me through the
through his program uh or his videos on
YouTube even that scale is a two-part
process it's it's scale and clean up and
scale and clean up you always need to
clean up the operation before you
further scale so I think in part that
there are growing pains in building up a
business and I think you you know
sometimes you scale too fast and you're
like this is overwhelming and not fun
and I'm like I'm I'm kind of um it feels
like you're giving up but actually what
you're doing is you're you're taking a
step back to clean up the operation and
look back around it and then at some
point the itch will be you know need to
be scratched and you're gonna be like
okay well but if I would actually scale
a little bit yeah yeah okay I agree when
you said the stories like yeah it makes
sense exactly what you said skill too
fast you have it becomes a bit too
overwhelming you clean up that's why I
we did a dressy cleanup uh and indeed
like I can't help myself because I also
it's just like in poker right when this
guy in this kind of Mark is also
interesting oh it's okay so if I do this
and this happens oh interesting like
it's it's in me but I guess I did learn
more about
like my own values and what I find
important in my life and I can at least
take that in consideration when I do
skill to to if that makes sense yeah
yeah I mean scale is like again your if
your skills are improved in business and
it will also feel very different I like
this so one of the interviews with Alex
ramosie one thing that he said that
really resonated with my business
situation especially back then when I
heard it was your business usually fails
at the uh abilities of the owner and not
at the uh at the size of the opportunity
so oftentimes what happens is you build
up a business to excise the amount of
employees Revenue customers whatever it
is and then you um a lot of business
owners they go sideways then and they
start a new venture and they build it up
to the same breaking point and then they
feel like the opportunity has
maximized already and they cannot go
further so they're going to go to the
next business and they build up like
these different opportunity vehicles but
they all feel like micromanaged because
they could never go beyond the thing
that they build it up to and they think
it is because of the size of the of the
opportunity but it isn't it is actually
their skills that is holding them back
so at some point it will be
it comes to the decision point where
you're like you know what let's not look
left or right let's not switch
perspectives but actually think about
what is the skill skill required right
now to actually improve my business to
the next level make it bigger and there
will be some Growing Pains first but the
most important thing about growing pains
is just like in the gym it's only a
temporary pain that is out there like
you making the business bigger and
scaling it you will have some sucky
things to do on your to-do list but it's
temporary if you do your job right and
you develop the business further at some
point it will be like oh this is now way
easier like for me for example running
the business with like
10 15 people that we have right now is
way easier than it was with five people
it's way way easier but it wasn't always
like that it was like in the beginning
it was like we went to 10 to 15 back to
10 it was like a nightmare like super
long hours I was like super overwhelmed
playing poker putting in hours that way
because I was so much in business and
and then at some point you hire the
right people they take the right
responsibilities you clean out your
operations and you ask yourself uh what
are the essential tasks in my business
that really need to take place and what
is all just optional and suddenly you
everything becomes a lot a lot easier
after a while and you're like wow this
is amazing now suddenly I build up an
asset and I take the role in my business
that I enjoy the most this is also like
maximum Freedom basically if you can do
that because you find the right Partners
to work with like someone will be better
than will be the thing that you hate
doing in your business someone will like
doing and they will be good at it and
they will do it and the thing that you
are really good at you can maximize your
time in that and take full advantage of
it if the the rest of the business is is
managed by the people that are good at
it and in my case so it's the same thing
like I have Visionary roles in my
business and coaching roles and um
and uh I'm I'm basically more talking
with my business more long term
where are we going what are the big
decisions and how is the industry
changing and keeping my pulse on that
and I also talk one-on-one with a lot of
people in the business to understand
their incentives like where they want to
take their career within my business how
can I support it how can we support that
but there are a million other tasks that
I have nothing to do with because
they're all administrative nature and I
hate all of them so I don't do any of
them and I'm completely happy with that
but it wouldn't be if I had to take
anyone if I had to take any of these
tasks on I wouldn't be but I have the
right partners that are that are
understanding how to build the business
around me I think that is especially
when you're the face of the company the
most important skill set is to find
people that can build a business around
your skill set and respect that and they
don't expect you to do things that you
don't want to do but they understand
where you're good at and they do the
rest around you it's kind of like when
you are a CEO and you have personal
assistant like they clean up the [ __ ]
around you so you can be good at the
stuff that you actually really enjoy
yeah you're that's also what I had to
think about early in the podcast when
you said that double down on the skills
that you're actually good at uh instead
of trying to do all the things that that
you don't like and are also not good at
as well so yeah you you've given me a
lot of stuff to think about uh so thank
you for that uh it was it like I was
already thinking about it but you
definitely get a lot of good inputs and
good perspectives I'm sure some of the
listeners uh can relate going back to
well we're gonna we're gonna switch here
a little bit to the actual playing poker
I was curious you also mentioned that
you've invested over 100k in coaching
now sure some of that were I think I
also mentioned seminars or business
coaching or mindsets coaching from a
technical perspective what has been the
biggest strategical breakthrough that
you can remember in your career
well so one of the things is like the
bigger your coaching platform becomes
the less people want to coach you so
like for me getting coaching is very
very difficult even if I would pay a lot
of money the main feedback is like the
people that I ask personally if they
want to coach me because I think they're
the best players in the world basically
their feedback is even if you like
if if they would put up a high hourly
like two thousand dollars an hour for
example and they would coach me they are
aware that they're basically coaching
thousands of people at the same time
through me so they don't want to do that
and which is definitely one of the big
downsides of having a coaching company
is that that's how you're perceived
you're coaching the whole industry so
they don't want to they don't want to
help you so a lot of the stuff in terms
of how I get better is more like
self-taught or within our own coaches so
our own coaches they communicate with
each other and help each other that way
but I would say the biggest breakthrough
for me really was I I became
so the solver the introduction of a
solver into any form of Poker has
different periods the first period is
like when everyone when no one really
knows how to use the solver and they're
playing around with it and some people
get more out of it and some people less
and I would say in that period I
excelled the most
because
it is not as much about precision and
execution and more about macro level
understanding oh we see something some
Trends some new ideas of a solver that
we haven't thought about how does that
change the meta and how does that change
my strategy that was what I was I was
better at that than coming up with my
own stuff prior to the solver and then
when another stage of a solver
introduction is then the when the solver
introduction is more matured which is
where we are right now in no limit in
PLO now it is more about memorization
and accuracy
than it is about conceptual
understanding
because nowadays you have all the Sims
that you have all the spots and all the
flops and all the turns all the rivers
especially No Limit so you don't need to
work with a subset where you where it's
more about conceptual takeaways you can
work just with the exact solution at all
times and it's super fast and available
and I would say that is not my strong
suit like I am not a big
proponent or fan of like
execution on a very precise level and
memorization
likewise so I'm not I'm not like I
couldn't train with a trainer for like
five hours and be
motivated to continuously do that and I
think that is also the reason why I
coach most of the time right because I
enjoy conceptual teaching more than
executional learning
or memorization so I would say now
nowadays my edges are more coming from
like live poker because in live poker
people don't understand any concept
basically and the importance of Concepts
in live poker is much higher than online
because there are more variables at play
so in live poker you play a lot more
multi-way parts and there are not less
solutions for it so you need to have
more conceptual understanding that this
because the spots are so variable like
you can have four-way parts of different
stack sizes and people have very extreme
tendencies that are super exploitable so
you need to have a conceptual
understanding how to deal with it online
it's more like most spots are one-on-one
on the Flop and you have the same SBR
and you have the same ranges in play and
it's more about Precision of execution
which you would have to add time to
learn beforehand through a solver I'm
mainly a business person and a coach I
don't have time to memorize and train
with a solver so on that in in that
specific field out I'm like less
knowledgeable and cannot compete at the
same level as someone who's only playing
poker so I'm not sure if that answers
the question but that's in depth I can I
can definitely relate I'm way more of a
conceptional learner myself and I think
that there's a lot of benefits let's say
for example I play an MTT or like when I
started to play live like yeah okay this
specific situation is different but the
same Concepts the ideas like the
heuristics or the concepts behind why a
software does what it does it still
applies so you solve the puzzle at that
moment it's like oh well conceptually
speaking this is probably and you know
you're not going to be as accurate but
that's the whole idea right if you play
in scenarios that constantly keep a
chain you cannot be as accurate but you
can apply certain Concepts and with
those Concepts you will gain an edge you
you grew up obviously pre-solver when
you started using solver what was like
the biggest mistake that you made when
from using the solver yeah
uh that's a good question let's think
about it so I I started using solvers
with po even though I was playing PLO
because I figured that there has to be
some link which was true and I I learned
a lot more about Equity realization and
positional disadvantage and polarization
I learned a lot of these Concepts from
No Limit and then trying to apply them
to PLO so by the time I worked with
moncr solver which is a PLO solver that
came out later much later than po I was
already I already knew what a software
kind of does and how to work with it in
some ways and that's also why my
products back then 2017 were all based
around Minecraft solver because I
already understood that a solver in PLO
will change the entire landscape so
obviously there were some mistakes I
would say the main mistake is not to is
not to understand that people probably
do these days as well
is to don't they don't really understand
that a solver output is a hypothetical
game
that is just a it's just all about
Action Reaction so this player does X
and so you do y and that's modeled in
the Sim and
that is not applicable to real life in
all cases it is just modeling as a
hypothetical equilibrium that can teach
you some concepts of reaction and action
and if you don't understand that then
like if that flies over your head even
after really thinking about what that
means then you're always going to be
like many steps behind of how do you
actually use a solver basically and I
think that's that is probably just a
blind application is probably what most
people struggle with and and even to
this day
the only way to overcome blind
application of a solver really is to
have exploitative data so you need to be
like well people aren't check raising
that's frequency or this range
composition in this spot here is the
data and therefore the actual solution
to this problem is going to be like this
that is a very like poker is a very
difficult game and finding good answers
to very complex problems with imperfect
information is very difficult so I would
say the
the biggest challenge people face and
also myself in explaining the game and
trying to teach it is that there is no
Bland application of anything available
like possible that makes sense and at
the same time there's no perfect
information about how to actually play
like in chess you can say this is the
best move that you can make right now
period there's no discussion in in hold
in poker
that's just not possible because you
have imperfect information and therefore
you can solve for what is the best move
right now
yeah I would think that the actual
reaction even further because it all
starts basically with the ranges because
the ranges determine the equities which
incentivizes you to take a certain
action then the next step is indeed why
if I take this action how does someone
react so there's like two components you
have the action reaction and the actual
ranges that incentivize or desensifies a
certain action and you have to start to
and this is I think the most important
thing to study and to play around with
what are the impacts if I change some of
these variables right how does the
solution shift right or left and what
does that mean what kind of concept can
I learn from that and can I start
applying at the table so I can adjust to
different situations where I think the
ranges are different or where I think my
opponent will play different because for
example like how EV is generated is
indeed also dependent how your opponent
Acts or reacts right not just oh yeah
this is the this is uh and out of that
you can learn like oh versus this type
of player profile I can generate a v in
this way or these type of hands they go
down if you this kind of hands go up and
event this type of lines and that's why
I think you really start to understand
program which becomes way more
applicable like you said in live
environments where the situations are
way less static where you suddenly have
the area of way more different profiles
you have people who are in different
moods uh you have uh yeah yeah like you
say a four-way party if all kind of
weird stuff going on so that's when you
really have to start applying these
Concepts
um
when you worked to your way throughout
throughout the ranks uh what was like
the toughest jump you had to make in
Stakes which which jump was the toughest
I think the most difficult is when you
go from mid to high stakes because the
the high stakes ecosystem is very
different to mid-stakes ecosystem
mistakes is a lot more about consistent
there's more consistent action at least
there used to be still nowadays in PL
there is like there's more consistent
action and
and you don't face for the most part you
don't face overruled people at that
stake so overall means people that are
just crushing consistently because they
would already have moved up when you
play high stakes people are constrained
by the availability of action more so
than their bankroll many times so you
will face opponents that have crushed
this Limit Forever and they still play
the same limit because there's no higher
game so you will face the best of the
best and admit States you just don't
because they have moved on to higher
Stakes to whatever is available
so therefore the higher Stakes action is
like extra predatory which means the
action usually only runs if there is a
whale in the game and that creates a
different Dynamic and the dynamic is
that the whale chooses which Stakes
you're playing so if you're trying to
jump for example from PLO 500 back in
the days that would be running on stars
and you would want to play PLO 2K which
is usually the next stake that's four
times the jump
and maybe the whale doesn't want to play
2K but he wants to play 5K so in the
same player pool will form around the 5K
pool a 5k whale then a 2K whale because
everyone is overruled or taking shots so
you have to be willing if you want to
play high stakes to sometimes just
double the stakes for whatever reason
because the fish plays 5K not 2K and
that means you're gonna face way bigger
variants monetarily speaking than when
you play 2K and maybe you want to stay
sharp so you're also going to play 500
but the problem with 500 is that it just
feels demotivating because you win
nothing in comparison to 5K and you have
one losing session at 5K which is
crushed for 10 binds I mean one buying
is 10 buy-ins
and
not going to make the money back at 500
plus at 500 you play against a
completely different set of regulars
than at 5K that have different skills
and different weaknesses and so on so
it's it's it's a moving up from mid to
high stakes is uh
it's a completely different deal you
play multiple different Stakes you play
some of the best players in the world
that are overalled for the games
and you have a lot less volume and
consistent action so if you think about
less volume and you play different
Stakes the variance just goes completely
to the roof which nowadays for me
because I have other income streams is
not a huge deal but if you're a solo
poker player it is a huge mess to having
to wait for action and then just play
like a couple hands of 5K or 10K lose 10
000 and might not have you might not
have action for another three days just
waiting that is um
it's very difficult to have make a
living that way
how did you deal with the the swings
like as soon as you have a big range in
Stakes as you could say basically how
well or bad you run at your high stakes
kind of determines sort of your your
year result how did you handle those
swings
that's a good question I mean I would
say that
by the point that was playing a
regularly high stakes I already had
enough of a successful business where
the poker result wouldn't impact my
ability to live my life
do the fullest basically like it
wouldn't impact my
my net earnings enough to the point
where it bothered me too much it was
more that
it what bothered me more is
I would play in games that are generally
good but the problem is the opponents
are so good because that's all they do
and they're just like it's a very
predatory environment so
it's a it's a killer environment in some
ways obviously there's a whale and that
makes it great
but you are playing against players that
are trying really really hard and are
some of the best players in the world
and they're playing because they're
playing for a living and I'm playing
because I can play and it's still a
profitable game but I'm working with
smaller edges so that in combination
what I'm trying to say is basically when
you play poker and you're not sure you
have an edge that really can be
bothersome because the whole identity
that we have created around ourselves is
that we have an edge and you don't
always know if you have an edge because
that's not how the game works but you
the game looks good but there are other
things to consider you don't really know
how hard your opponents are trying you
don't know exactly how good they are and
you also sometimes underestimate impacts
like rake that come into play where the
game looks good but it might not be as
good as it as it as it looks on the
surface level so there are a lot of
things to consider when playing high
stakes and for me monetarily like it
wasn't
that was not the big issue because I
dealt with it otherwise with business
but more game selection wise it was
difficult to decide what is a good game
and what is not a good game or the right
game for me
yeah and especially uh
especially when you take a shot you
prefer to take a shot as a highest EV
game possible Right to to reduce the
swings to a certain degree but yeah your
ads indeed always it's hard to estimate
you also don't or still do a lot of uh
coaching
throughout your coaching experience what
is like the most common leaks that you
find in the players that you coach and
how do you go about fixing them
mostly leaks people have are
from from like professional nature like
they're not really approaching poker
like a business or like something that
is super serious so they're like leaking
certain character traits that would help
them to be more consistent
it's a lot more that than just like pure
brain power if you think about
your ability like your mental cognition
to problem solve that is dampened by
your uh mental awareness right so
there's a model by Sam Owens where he
talks about the Billionaire's mind and
the bottom of the engine which is your
brain or your well your brain you can
say he talks about mental awareness so
like basically your ability to focus on
something and if that ability is is
um
dampened by your lifestyle poor
lifestyle choices for example like
you're spending too much time on social
media you're drinking going out you're
just living generally like not light
good life hygiene so to speak
your mental cognition will only be
running at 50 and most people would have
enough mental cognition enough brain
power to actually be good poker players
they are not in the mental state of
awareness that is required to really
take out 100 of that then they're going
to operate at 50 there's not enough to
like make it really work
so I think for most people it's more
about about fixing anything that is easy
to access their full mental cognition
which is just like all the distracting
stuff that happens in the real world
like social media and distractions and
going out and drinking and all this kind
of stuff like if they were to get rid of
a lot of this stuff and get more clear
on what they really want out of life
then
they themselves would know how to get
better at the game because getting
better at the game nowadays is as easy
as it ever was so that's already
difficult it's more about how much uh
how much uh
how much brain power is available to you
to dedicate to that task on a daily
basis so I would sit together with
people that are coaching and I would ask
them more like what is your day-to-day
going to look like and what are you
doing to actually actively become better
and oftentimes it wouldn't even have a
database or they wouldn't even know how
much bigplan pounder they're paying in
rake or they wouldn't have rigid study
habits that would allow them to build up
a knowledge base to then execute on so
it's a lot more about these things than
strategic misunderstandings but
obviously strategically speaking I would
say but most people struggle with in
poker is
they they think and believe that they
are not good at Game Theory because it
sounds so complicated and when I read or
try to read mathematics of Poker which
is something most people should not read
I didn't understand anything and I was
like I'm bad at understanding Game
Theory and math like I'm just like not
built for this but nowadays with solvers
you don't need to be good at any of that
stuff like you can actually like Game
Theory and understanding poker on a
conceptual level is not that hard you
just have to like start watching some
videos and looking at outputs like Sims
and you suddenly start realizing oh this
all makes sense like it makes sense why
this hand gets raised it is because
we're attacking this part of our
opponent's range second time so removal
effects it makes a lot of sense so
what's the big concept behind it well
it's this this and this okay can I
formulate it in a couple of words sure
this is the concept I'm going to write
it down so most people They Don't Really
Ever
make the leap from um copying what they
see other people do to thinking
conceptually about the game what is the
concept at hand here that I can extract
and use in my game how does it apply in
this spot how does it apply in that spot
they never really go there because I
think because they think they can't do
it
and I guess also the terminology often
used sounds too complicated but I've
heard the same concept being explained
in a super easy way that everyone can
understand and I've heard the same
concept get explained in a way that I'm
like wait wait which concept are we
talking about oh you're talking about
this concept but I you you so much words
that it sounded really really smart but
now I had no more clue what you're
actually talking about like for example
utilization I remember I was coaching a
football player once and then I said
yeah but you have to do it yeah we
shouldn't let them make his hands like
yeah indeed you have to deny Equity yes
indeed yeah you know because if you
don't be big he's gonna make a stupid
hand on the turn and say yeah exactly
denial indeed yeah but he just were
facing away it's way yeah way more
intuitive for a human uh to understand
when it comes down to No Limit have you
ever probably you have have you ever
coached No Limit Hold'em players trying
to switch to PLO and what are actually
common mistakes that no limit holding
players make when they switch to below
it's a good question I definitely had
some like high stakes players that are
trying to make the transition
let's think about this I would say PLO
is a lot more Equity driven as mentioned
before so it's more about assessing your
absolute hand strength and understanding
understand relatively like where it lays
so for example I have top two pair how
strong is it right now is it extremely
important and relevant ever coming back
question in PLO PLO is a lot more about
understanding how your hand strength
matches up with the spr and the action
that you see so top two pair for example
can be of various strengths dependent on
the SBR the action you see and the exact
board cards are out there were in in
Holden top to pair is
much more of a of a static hand class
like the absolute hand strength to
relative hand strength terms just in
comparison to PLO is much more static so
like you can make you can make more
rules about flushes and straights and
top hairs and two pairs in No Limit
we're in PLO it's much more Dynamic
where suddenly your top two pair is is a
is a bluff catcher or or just like a
trashy hand so in the solver for example
you would see things like
let's make an example board is like 10 9
Deuce with two diamonds and you're in
the big blind and you have like a ten
nine with a meaningless side cards it
could be a hand like Jack Jack ten nine
so you don't really have a straight draw
or you don't have a flush draw you might
check raise the flop in a single Race
part and if your opponent Parts over the
top and makes a flop pretty bad you're
gonna fold your top two pair in that
instance and you were using it kind of
as blockers by check raising but once he
puts all the money in at spr 13 your
hand becomes a fold and that switch from
making from looking at your hand in the
Flop and thinking I have top two pair
it's a great flop to and then you check
race even supporting that claim and then
you get shoved on and saying actually
now it's a fault that is like
incomprehensible for most people in or
coming from No Limit or just coming in
coming into PL in general but it is the
easiest demonstration of the point that
your absolute handstand can change very
quickly within the course of a hand and
based on the action you see in the spr
at hand yeah so the equities are going
to shift more often on the latest street
so looking ahead and thinking about how
strong my hand is going to be on
multiple turns and reverse is more
important but then again I
and it obviously depends on the sphere I
do have the fitting
oh yeah obviously the deeper yes we are
the more important this becomes and the
shadow where the spr because I offer
sometimes I see below and I'm like okay
yeah pops guy never Falls to three but
spots race but you know the money goes
in like what the [ __ ] did this happen
did I see the heads they're like oh
these hands are not very strong but I
definitely feel like the spr is a very I
can hold him it's already a big expert
but I feel like especially in three in
PLO I see people stacking off
shallow SBR is very light and then
deeper this I feel like the SBR impact
in PLO is even more increased also by by
the reasons you just explained yeah as
the nuts and bolts of PLO is like spr-1
33 Equity espr2 40 spr 3 42.5 spr 4 40.4
like those are just basic numbers you
need to know to be like oh okay spr4 I
can pot call it off here because I need
uh well without full if your opponent
Parts into your SP or four you need 44
equity and if you and against the stack
of range it's probably not going to fold
so you need to know by hand does have 44
plus percent equity to push it in here
against my potent stack of range once
he's potting like those are you need to
have the experience to understand how
equities are going to look like and what
Equity is required at any given spot and
and and that can be like a learned
relatively easily or resolvers you can
understand these thresholds kind of
quick but but
um it's not as common to think about
that equity
shift all the time and no limit hold him
we're in no limit hold him you think
more frequency based on I have top pair
top kicker so this hand is going to be a
call down right because I can beat all
the Bluffs where in PLO it's more like
My Equity was X on this street on the
next street it was Y which is completely
different and now my hand becomes an
instant fold it happened that happens a
lot more often in PLO I think it does
help from uh for example from a mental
making mental game mistakes it's very
common in Holdem that you kind of hook
on a certain hand strike on the Flop
like you said ah stop right the kicker
and then you don't take in consideration
the future or at least you take less in
consideration future actions that might
change your opinion because you're
already hooked I think I guess naturally
PLO players they evaluate better their
strength of their hand on every street
because they have to because the
strength can change so so rapidly
exactly yeah making that shift is is a
big difference there for sure you also
he also mentioned you nowadays play way
more live in terms of mistakes that for
example especially for example during
the series you see some online kids
coming out to Vegas to play a live poker
but I like some common mistakes you see
online players make when they go play
live
the biggest mistake is to bring their
backpack and their own salads
brings out the wrong actually
this year and actually there was a girl
and she also brought her own lunch and
then there was a regular at the game and
they also said and then she was gone and
he said yeah while she brought her own
lunch what did you expect like how she
was gonna play and then we were talking
a bit about uh uh a bit about like uh
like reads based on they say yeah you
see this guy he looks like he just came
out of I came out of bed his hair is all
wild he's ready to blast he said he's
ready
22 year old kid just came out of bed
rough hair is gonna blast and then they
looked at me and said you you know if
your hair slick you know you dress
nicely every day you're way more
calculated you can bless as well but it
will be a calculated blast he was
basically explaining like all the pros
all that they were very very much
enjoyed it but yeah thank you very much
if you play live poker images is super
important in uh in many different ways
like when I started playing
when I started playing in Vegas like
basically moving there kind of for the
first time there are a couple things
that I
started implementing like the first one
is
I don't in if you're in the U.S and you
play live poker
I personally like I'm trying to fit in
more so than be the European guy so even
if I meet someone from Switzerland I
don't want to I don't want to talk in
German or in my native language because
that is being seen a lot more like
unfriendly to the environment so I'm
trying to fit a lot more in speak
English and understand their culture so
like they like for example
um American Sports is a big topic on the
table who's betting on which game
uh you don't short stack you uh don't
come with the backpack like you might
even wore expensive clothing because it
makes the game overall more casual
basically so I understood the importance
of playing deep playing with a lot of
chips uh wearing expensive clothing not
bringing a backpack like all this stuff
matters in order to make the game feel
much more comfortable to the
recreational player because it doesn't
look like it's going to hurt you to lose
a lot of money which is good which means
that you're going to give more action
and they're going to pay you off more
often and also they feel more like a
need that you're an equal that you're
not there like you never want to give
away the feeling that you need
desperately to win at the poker game you
want to give away the feeling that this
is a fun game and we're all playing
royal gambling we're not talking about
strategy we're not bringing the
backpacks and we're not looking like
we're saving money on anything like you
tip Goods to the dealers you tip while
to the waiters and you talk sports and
you play deep stacks and you straddle
and also that's another thing is that
when you straddle never ask the table if
you want to straddle that's just the
weakest thing ever you just struggle
that's it and then either someone
straddles as well or they don't but
these are like small things that the
Holden the whole dynamic of the table
will be influenced by
especially if you have authority like in
my case because you play PLO a lot of
people know me at the table like I'm not
going to get rid of the coach's image
but what I do is I buy in deep I am
let's say I I lost a couple of parts and
we play a big one I might say I'm gonna
run it one time I need to get unstuck
like I'm gonna say that and do that
because it makes the game more real
we're not playing like a computer game
we're playing we're gambling I'm trying
to get even so we're gambling we're
running at once or I'm straddling under
the gun not asking the table are we all
doing a straddle no I'm straddling let's
play right you should Advocate there you
should educate the average No Limit
holding game that I played there because
there's a lot of things going on I mean
I was definitely guilty of the backpack
I did not bring my own lunch so that
that
that's what I didn't do but uh it's very
normal because when you are a tourist
then you obviously want to bring some
stuff with you but it's like small
things that that can really help you to
just not only get paid off but in my
case for example I usually play
the game that I play in Vegas is a one
table game so it's only there's only one
table that runs that game and if the if
the game breaks then there's no game for
anyone to play so it's either this game
or no game so you want to make sure the
game keeps running and the game keeps
running if the recreation players have
fun and the way they have fun is by you
not short stacking but you gambling by
you talking by you being active and you
know and there are like small things you
can do for example
um things I started implementing is that
I saw another guy who teaching a wreck
is doing this a lot like he's standing
up a lot in the hand and even though
it's when you hear about it it sounds
kind of annoying but if you think about
someone that is kind of nervous and is
trying to gamble like you you might
stand up you know like on the Flop I
might stand up and I'm like I'm all in
I'm all in you know and you do that and
then what what is what it creates is
like it creates more fun and action you
know like this guy is always standing up
he's ready to gamble like what are we
doing once or twice or three times it's
only run two times around the bottom
whatever it is like it is you're trying
to basically create a cool environment
to have fun in
and
and if you do that you their game runs
longer the recreational stay longer they
have more fun they come back and also
you might uh
you might get more action in several
spots like I got soft play in many spots
or I got paid off in many spots where it
is more the small things you do that add
up to a picture in their head that then
that makes them believe oh this guy is
tilting or he's about to bring it in
with something light or whatever it is
and they're gonna end up paying you off
it all comes together and also at the
end of the day it's a lot more fun so
what I would recommend people doing is
number one speak the language and only
the language that is spoken at that
poker room if you can right if obviously
if you can you can't try to fit in try
to make the game as fun as possible
don't short stack table select table
move seed move like all these kind of
things generally trying to avoid them
and uh
and be communicative and if you if you
do these things you not only get more
action in general but you might get a
couple of numbers you might do
pre-organized games you know every
people are like complaining everything
is privatizing but the market is what
the market is and if the games are
private then you only have two options
either you're going to fit in or you
don't adapt or die we come back again
right yeah so you have to you have to up
your you have to be a player you have to
play in a way and behave in a way that
people like to play with you if you want
to get invite invited into games that
like if everything becomes private you
need to find a way to be in there right
exactly and there were several instances
in Vegas like this one guy for example
was like ah who wants to fly back to the
last 5K I'm like let's flip you know I
mean it's anyway even neutral who cares
and and if you're if you're that guy
that is not afraid of just like because
you're not desperately looking for the
Min cash and then leave
that's good like you're good for the
game and so but that's like I was in
generally surprised about like a lot of
the guys who play way more lives than me
for example if there's I would always
chat with specially with the recreation
players is because like you know that
often the day will be quite dead people
will put headphones in and stuff and I'm
like guys this is like I do it if you
understand that this is not what this
guy is gonna like to do so I I have a
chat Hey sir where are you from
but I'm like wait I'm the online kid why
why am I doing this job you know I
didn't get it
like it comes quite natural to me
because I'm also I'm also I was also
there professional slash Recreation
because I was also there to have fun
right I'm not going to be there sit with
my headphones that was not my my my idea
of the trip uh I did feel bad I stacked
the guy twice in a row and I was the
only one chatting with him so I was
going to befriending him then I stacked
him twice and it's really weird like
in life it's it's a bit weird especially
if you cool it I call it the guy twice
he had to leave grab more money and then
like an orbit lady I could at the
beginning he had to leave the only
Recreation at the table I was the only
one befriending him so I felt really
awkward and also he looked at me in a
way like
it's like okay I prefer online in this
in this battle so I don't see what
happens after I took someone's money so
it's a bit awkward it's something that
uh yeah
that's interesting because the dynamic
is uh like the dynamic I have with Rex
is very different sometimes to
recreational players like with I might
hard play like some ranks like super
hard in certain spots where I choose
like the most uncomfortable line or the
most uncomfortable spot it might be that
I might run it once against the guy that
is like
uncomfortable with the money because
he's a pro and I'm like sending a
message of like you know there's a price
to pay to pay here
to play here and the price of the pro or
like if he's an uncommunicative Pro or
playing short obviously I'm running
always one time because it's like guy
like you're not doing anything for the
game you're playing sort of gives a [ __ ]
like we don't need you guys I never
understood why do people not not like am
I in my online head is like wait why
would you not run it twice give me one
good reason but I've heard many good
reasons
what well one of them is short stacks
kill the game so you want to run it one
time another one is it just makes
like if
poker players look at gambling as the
Ultimate Enemy
and that's a big mistake gambling is a
big part of Poker and if you can Embrace
a couple of spots of gambling here and
there it's much much better not only for
your image at the table but for your
psyche about how to approach the game if
you think gambling is a huge enemy then
variance is also a huge enemy to you but
if you are okay with gambling sometimes
you're like you know what today we're
gonna Gamble and let's see what happens
then you are a little bit freed up from
this I'm signing up to a nine-to-five
job I need my hourly paid up at the end
of the day hopefully I'm not going to be
off deviation like if you can free up
yourself from that and say today we're
going to gamble some poker then you fit
into the last into the live scene a lot
better because recreational players
that's how they think they're like today
we're gambling I want to have a big win
let's see what happens and sometimes you
get it in and you're like I want to run
it one [ __ ] time because I'm trying
to win a 20K pot let's go and then the
recreation is going to be like damn
and then and then he's like ah this
guy's like me we're gambling here you
know that's what we're doing so that
that's much more healthy for the game
than
you know trying to do like let's do the
even variance thing or whatever it is
like I I definitely need if if I want to
play more life I definitely need to up
my gamble because on one side for
example when when the things are normal
AKA they look like online poker I'm in
my comfort zone right you know exactly
what's going on but the more side games
the more straddles the more [ __ ] goes on
the more I get pushed outside the more
the game gets gambly and on one side I
like it I like the side games the
naturally you know triggers my curiosity
I'm also here to play live and I'll say
that fun but I do I'm not like and I'm
definitely not much of a gambler myself
so there's like some resistance that
like I'm also I like it I understand I
don't like it because I kind of lose
control over what's going on the table
whereas if we just keep the table normal
I know exactly what what to do I know
I'm perfectly in my comfort zone but you
know with with experience for example
stand-up game I love it it's it's it's
almost do they do it in PLO or no don't
do it in PLO when I heard about send
them game the only thing that conflicts
me about it is that it is so easy to
collude in a stand-up game so that's the
only thing to pay attention to if you
play a stand-up game with a lot of racks
especially in No Limit where you can
force people out of the Pod easily
that's the only thing that would be like
the Eevee of cheating in head in
stand-up games like cheating life is
difficult but not if you play a stand-up
game because you can just let people win
hands in certain spots by like youth you
know three bet them they four bet you
they fold you win the pot or whatever it
is and suddenly you're um I think that's
maybe one of the reasons why some people
have to show now their hand when they
want to win they have to always show
that was the there was a reason every
Android show you have to but I mean it
doesn't say anything let's say I format
someone I show complete trash everyone
just go yeah oh stand-up games but it
was maybe your body pre-agreed like hey
yeah
so basically you have to be careful when
you're with like friends who are all
right that's something like my players
are sharp like if player like poker
players that play live they spend hours
and hours and hours just sitting there
waiting for hands and they think about
things so they're pretty sharp on things
that online players don't necessarily
think about that much
right so that would be just generally
aware okay like this is a live game so
stuff happens here that I'm not used to
and these guys probably that's why I'm
all about adapting and I'm trying to
understand what's the the people that
have stood the test of times of playing
live poker like how do they behave what
do they do they probably have good
reasons for doing whatever they are
doing and trying to understand where
they are where they are coming from
especially the successful reputable ones
all right good advice Adam you must have
a gambler
I'm not actually even though I do like
the kind of thrill of things being out
of control insane Avenues in terms of
like going for gambling opportunities
I'm very much aversive to them in terms
I don't really seek them out I don't
really get much pleasure from them for
example if I went to the casino with my
friends I wouldn't really get much
pleasure from playing Blackjack playing
any gambling games whereas my friends
would be loving it at the end of time
their lives
um but in those Dynamics the way
Fernando explained that game I would
definitely be comfortable get involved
in the gambling fully game Dynamics I'm
more like a people please have so if the
the group dynamics demanded me to be a
gambler to fit into that environment I
think I would
become the Gambler just to to develop to
blend it but in general I wouldn't
naturally uh be a gambler from my from
my own accord so yeah I think I have
exactly the same I'm
I'm just
extra straddle side games but I'm never
the one who says no to anything I will
always say yes to everything I'm just a
pure pleaser because I'm like I'm not
gonna be that guy who says sometimes you
have a guy who's like no sorry I don't
straddle I was like okay again can then
just get out of the table you know it's
like but some guys actually some guys
were actually nice they said no I don't
straddle oh so this game is going to be
straddled okay then I'm out they
voluntarily decide to live but sometimes
I'm also like let the guy not straddle
if he doesn't want a straddle who cares
the rest Shadows let's go but yeah some
people have different different opinions
on that
I was always against gambling you know
because gambling has this because if
you're every poker player once it
becomes his profession sort of
tries to grab onto that he said to this
identity that we were making calculated
bets and that the enemy is gambling also
not only because we're making calculated
bets and we're trying to convince other
people that poker is a is a serious
thing but also because we know as poker
players that the gambling games in the
casinos are a trap to addiction and a
trap to uh
you know bath way a bad way of losing
your money in your life so we naturally
are averse to gambling and I was like
all the time but now spending more time
in Vegas I understand also that there
are big advantages of embracing certain
elements of gambling because it is part
of that culture and poker and gambling
are intertwined and at the end of the
day the reason we play poker is because
it is a gambling game for the
recreational player so they want to
gamble and they want to see other people
gamble and not just wait on the
sidelines to
um they don't want you to always be the
casino if that makes sense like you
always play with the edge and they don't
I mean they're not stupid and but they
also want to see sometimes you you know
giving action and you give action in
different ways that could involve
gambling that might even be neutral EV
but they're perceived as you are seeking
gambling action like they are it makes
you more relatable and it spices things
up and I think once you get more used to
that the swings that come naturally
through playing feel less intense
overall because you're more at peace
with variants given the gambling aspect
that is now newly introduced into your
life game and also you understand the
long-term EV so the short-term swing
because you were gambling is is more
easily Justified it yeah yeah I like as
well how the context of gambling has
been that it's in the context of playing
poker here when I talked about being
Reckless and betting your house on some
random coin flip but I think what
generally gets the connotation with
gambling is you're losing even you
always make a negative play but I think
a gambling I've got the casino I lose to
the house I'm gambling something else
it's generous like a reckless kind of
side to it in terms of how you can
interpret it but the way yacht is
playing gambling it's more embracing the
gambling side of Poker which is a big
part of this and playing to the strength
of that in these especially live
Dynamics to create a better atmosphere a
longer term EV and it's a different type
of gambling sounds like a gamble with a
payoff where a lot like payoff in terms
of equity in the future but also the
game Dynamics where in general but my
conversation when I think a gambler is
think um almost like either Break Even
or generally losing I'm just taking a
risk for no real reason long term
there's a long-term EV of a gumball but
in these Dynamics I really like the how
you're almost thinking long term of
where the gambling is leading to which
is great all right I want to finish on
one question for me one question I want
to finish on a Denzel Washington Court
you mentioned in your questionnaire is
sent to you you said don't just aspire
to make a living aspire to make a
difference I want to know why that's
important to you and how polka has
fulfilled this value for you as you've
gone for your career
yeah poker can be very like solo Pursuit
where you basically are just trying to
please yourself while trying to mess up
other players because it's a competition
at the end of the day and that's what
competition is all about is beating
other people
and I don't think there's anything
inherently wrong with it I mean
competition is life and even if you're
in business or wherever you are in the
dating World competition is a real thing
it's a survival of the fittest and I
think it's healthy for humans to
interact in that but also as you get
older most people will realize that hey
maybe I want to also give something back
or influence some people leave something
behind provide more value
and I think that's extremely fulfilling
because I think in your 20s as we
discussed in the early stages it's more
about finding this identity and
self-confidence by doing something
you're proud of in a pursuit of
improving yourself so you look more
inwardsly in order to find something
you're proud of and as you grow older
you look more outwardly in order to
achieve the same thing so you becoming
Stronger Faster smarter is going to
start giving you less appreciation and
satisfaction and it's more about what
can I do for others that naturally
humans as they progress through life and
you get closer to the end of your life
you start thinking a lot more about so I
think it's just it's just a change in
priorities most people probably
experience that with with when they
start raising a family and have a child
they're like well now my own priorities
are like me improving my life becomes
less important than this child's life
and then on a different from a different
angle it would be other people whether
with making a business like running a
business like in my case running the
business is something that is extremely
fulfilling because you
are helping each other basically to have
great lives in careers and you connect
with each other in a Mutual Way like not
in the pursuit of battling each other
and that's I think very healthy if you
think about
if you think about what's a good life
for most people
I think rolling it all the way back to
more ancient times is a good blueprint
for that it's a lot about community and
coming together as often as possible so
when we talk about lifestyle design in
2023 I think if you can replicate that
to a certain degree you will find a lot
more happy people so how can you live a
life where you are together more often
with peers and friends and spend more
time with them instead of pursuing Your
Own Thing relentlessly
and I think that's also a form of giving
back it's just like building a community
with your friends
and achieving something together and
I've been doing this on a business level
by by building this company but also on
a personal level I'm today living a much
more interconnected life where I'm
traveling with friends to different
destinations and stops I'm seeing them
more often we do more things together in
person than I used to
and that has definitely given me much
more life quality but it was a some I
mean it was a pretty conscious lifestyle
design decision it is not just happening
randomly
um yeah very inspiring so what would you
recommend or give advice to somebody
who's maybe stuck in the uh aspiring to
make a living model they're trying to
make ends meet and they'd love to uh
have some breathing space to give back
but they're kind of in their own
narrative and they're hustling and
grinding from my own experience I've
almost felt like you you need to win
that game at some degree you need to
create some Breathing Room some space
and then once you get a certain point
you realize ah my own intrinsic needs of
trying to seek my own goals yes I can
still go over stuff but I also I'm in a
position now with knowledge with wisdom
with time with energy to give back to
others so um if someone is stuck in the
kind of acquiring to make a living like
many people listen to this any advice
you would give to those to maybe uh push
through that patch and get to the kind
of more given uh difference
the world the easiest way to make a
living is to actually help others
because that's how you create value and
you get compensated for that obviously
in the poker sense doesn't necessarily
work that way because it's a competition
you're like an athlete but outside of
Poker that's basically how it works if
you think about how do I how do I want
to get compensated well the answer to
that to this question is depends on how
much value you can provide for other
people so if if you now exchange the
idea of money with
something like energy or feedback or
appreciation it works the same way if
you want to feel more energized or more
appreciated then just do something for
someone else and although I I do agree
that there's a certain level of
things you have to have achieved
yourself in order to fully or dedicate
more time to other people you can always
help someone else even on a small scale
on a daily basis and it's actually one
of the easiest methods to get out of
your head is to do something for someone
else versus over obsessing about your
own misery that you perceive to be so
bad it is easier to just say oh I'm how
can I do something for someone else and
then once you do that you're like ah
what was my problem again I actually
forgot and then you just move on and
and beyond that
so I think helping others can always
happen however
if you become more successful yourself
you just have more leverage over helping
other people so if you have more
financial possibilities for example or
you have a big business that you're
running you can help more people at the
same time which is also great
and like if you are 20 and you have no
money you can't really raise a family
and provide for a child so you can't
help that child very that much as if
you're older and you have more money and
more time maybe possibilities and I
would say in the same way that's also
true for
uh for helping people in general in my
case like the way I kind of look at it
is if I look at my friends group I have
some of my best friends are
15 years older than me and some of my
best friends are like 10 years younger
than me so I think there's a ton of
value in spending a ton of time with
people that are in different parts of
their journey in their life than you you
can gain wisdom from people that are
older like the way they talk to you is
more like
in an advisory way to have more wisdom
for you to share they are they are more
patient overall and if you talk to
younger people you can do the same thing
for them so the easiest way to help
other people and reach back is to just
work with younger people in my working I
mean maybe there might be in your
friends group like it's it's refreshing
to have people that are different age
groups in your friend Circle
um I also think it doesn't always have
to be with your kind of ideas and
knowledge often you can make a big
difference in people's lives by being a
good role model by Lean by example by
being the person that people turn to and
say oh they're the person that can do
those things or they follow through and
stuff they've got good character traits
and like you said it doesn't have to
always be on a big scale very often
you'll make a big difference to those
people you spend time with in your
proximity and you've always got
interactions with people where you can
make a difference to someone else's life
in a small way I think often when we
hear like the granddose terms of make a
difference we think like on a big scale
in the world or change in society in
reality is these micro moments these
kind of interconnections with people
where you have an opportunity to listen
to Somebody sometimes just listening to
somebody their problems and really
trying to understand them is a way to
make a difference so yeah I think
sometimes we can just make small
differences in lots of little places and
that fits into the the overall ocean
theme of trying to make a difference
overall all right so I'm very respectful
of your time Fernando so I want to ask
the final question which is often
Renee's question so sorry running for
stealing it uh but what would be the
main takeaway you'd like to the audience
to take away from today's conversation
you pay with us today
oh I enjoyed it very much I thought like
we're we're going to talk about a lot of
turn River play but uh it ended up being
turn river life play which is nice I
always appreciate these conversations
and I appreciate
that to find people that enjoy and can
hold these kinds of conversations
because when I think back about my
biggest aha moments it is from podcasts
like that where I can zoom out and
realize oh I haven't thought about it
that way or this way and on a much
bigger scale and that shifts my
direction and shifts my perspective into
something much more meaningful
after getting such input I would say
like my my main takeaway I would say
from this conversation is that
all of us in this call we came up in
poker a long time ago and we bring
that knowledge but also these biases
with us into today's poker market and
today's poker marketing climate is very
different and if someone wants to
be successful at poker nowadays which I
wouldn't say is necessarily a bad idea
that's definitely great possibilities
within it then they need to be very
adaptive to the current environment
which is now much more challenging and
competitive than it ever used to be
and
and approaching that from
a more sort of like
smart broader lens approach versus uh
I'm gonna work hard and be successful
approach is way more important today
than 10 years ago where 10 15 years ago
if you just worked really hard on your
poker game you can jump into any game at
any site at any moment and you will be
successful and you will have success for
the next five to ten years I would say
nowadays is a little bit different
today the opportunities in poker are
there you can make money they might come
in different forms maybe you have to
play live maybe you have to move
locations because the websites that you
want to play online are blocked in your
country maybe the taxes in your country
are shitty so therefore you shouldn't
play poker there maybe you want to have
a side income as a vlogger as an
ambassador as a streamer maybe you want
to be an affiliate maybe you want to
launch a podcast and have a new skill
set that you start acquiring to then
venture out into a different business
model for example like all these things
especially with today's modern
technology interconnectedness online are
things that the modern poker players
should consider in order to enrich their
career and also inject longevity because
if you're blindly steering towards the
poker Dream from 10 years ago you're
probably gonna have some sort of bad
wake-up call in a couple of years from
now and don't know where to go and
that's when people usually talk about
being stuck in poker and that's very
very avoidable nowadays just have to be
smart about it and hopefully this
conversation Nick helped some people to
consider that
I think it definitely will what I love
about speaking with you is I always get
New Perspectives that get you think
outside the box and think more long-term
strategically more yeah holistically and
so to speak so yeah I really thank you
for spending three hours with us today
to share all your insights I know myself
and Renee will definitely recap on what
we've learned from you as well today
because we like to uh and get our own
nuggets of Knowledge from the guests as
well so yeah thank you very much for the
time as possible to running any
follow-up questions for yourself or
anything no no no you uh you wrapped it
up perfectly
all right thank you Fernando
thank you guys too
thank you a lot Fernando great wisdom as
always Adam curious what are your main
takeaways from today's episode
yeah it was a very interesting
conversation I think perspectives was
one of the main ones I've learned from
my cats just coming into spoil the show
and yeah I think one of the main things
was how zoomed out and holistic he talks
about poker and his choices in poker so
I one of the main ones was looking at
poker as a business and treating the
poker options in terms of game selection
games You're Gonna Play in as almost
like Avenues you can explore in the
marketplace and before you start
optimizing your kind of game that you
want to play it'd be very careful with
selecting which Avenues are going to get
you the results you want and I really
like to talk about the kind of Building
Systems to achieve your goals going
forwards and then a really big part of
this was how to execute the system so we
talked a lot about basically deciding
the goal you want and picking the game
you want to play in then design the
system in terms of the planet and then
being the executor he went really deep
on how to uh overcome emotions how to
take actions in alignment with your
goals long term I think when you really
balance all these kind of things
together if you like really think hard
on these things you can get a very um
zoomed out perspective of where you're
going and then a very action orientated
step-by-step process of achieving your
goals and how to actually move forward
on a day by day basis so for myself I'm
definitely going to listen back to this
was a long episode of uh waiting in
perspectives but I really thought his
advice on this kind of bigger
perspective was really really powerful I
also liked what he talked about is in
trying to do stuff that makes you feel
proud and of myself I definitely more
and more so my my life going forwards I
align my goals more with things I know
I'll feel proud fulfilled at the end of
and this often means doing things that
are effortful and often challenging in
order to get a reward long term and I
think himself he mentioned like rather
than being happy in the moment often
happiness does not necessarily correlate
with our best actions or our goals and
yeah maybe going for what will make me
proud in the future could be a better
model so I think that's something for
aspiring players who are on the Journey
of figuring out where they're going
we're very useful and yeah I think
Fernando's got a lot of really
interesting ideas applying business to
Poker and yeah really really helpful for
myself and I think anyone listens to
this will we're getting a lot looking
back how about yourself what the main
takeaways for you
yeah he made a lot of uh every question
that we made he turns holistic straight
away I think it's a great quality and I
think he really showed that a lot of his
experience throughout
uh poker and everything that he learned
and then later also developed or applied
into other areas you can see how much
things we can actually learn uh yeah
throughout our broker career right this
has been
coming back in other podcasts as well
but I've definitely thought it was
pointed out here
um
some other things that I want to point
out we didn't actually talk that much
technical stuff in this episode but I
did point out a couple uh how to behave
at the live poker tables I remember in
the it was the podcast thing with Joe
viral uh where he also touched on this
right the Recreations are there to
gamble recreational they have to have
fun and we have to provide the fund for
him he gave a lot of good tips I was
definitely guilty of bringing my
backpack I did not bring my own lunch so
at least I I gave that box but indeed
adding some more Gamble and not thinking
only in terms of EV very important
lessons there we talked a lot about
conceptualizing right when he would
study solvers and when he would approach
the game this is also what he said like
in live poker because it's less the
situation less static I have to
conceptualize the knowledge and kind of
puzzle solve on the fly so
conceptualizing knowledge in when using
solvers or when studying data finding
like reasons behind why the data shows a
certain number it's very important it's
definitely very in line with our
coaching philosophy is well
he also talked about action reaction in
a solver like oh react in a certain way
because we expect a certain reaction or
react in a certain way we because we
expect our opponents to take certain
actions uh and the last one I wrote down
when I asked him about mistakes that
players often make he again turned it
very realistic he said yeah usually
people make mistakes because they're
only performing at half the capacity on
their brain which is due to Life Choices
that they make outside of the table
which can influence how they perform at
the table and if you reflect on it a lot
of the mistakes you will make at the
tables when going through hands maybe at
least half of them or at least have
talked for me personally are mistakes
that could have been prevented it's like
oh yeah I actually knew this but it
didn't come out so maybe I could
optimize some things that I can perform
at a higher level maybe the other half
are actually technical mistakes where
I'm like oh this is just knowledge that
I didn't know but it's way more common
that you make a mistake that you're
actually in hindsight kind of know what
the correct play is so it's more mental
games less performance related great
great part very happy it how it turned
out I hope you guys liked it as well I
