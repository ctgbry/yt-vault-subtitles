today see you yo yo good luck
here we are heads up versus OTB Red
Baron
I'll start over a little secret with
this one
let's see if we can take one down versus
the baron straight away
ah Fearless player pink turn is a check
on the Spate if it was a club I would
Barrel
but I think maybe if I had six four or
something I would even Barrel but I
think now we just got to check all once
if he checks back into four pairing it's
interesting I think I'm gonna go for the
check again
and maybe maybe actually a little sniff
upper sniff out the little uh bluffy
bluffy
so we sniff out a little Fluffy bluffy
Bluff he's very very first the baron
let's go
I thought I did have to Jack down with a
Spader
that is very unfortunate but you know if
you get the chance to to Hero called the
baron
no you just gotta do it
try a little raise here
he calls no actually we sometimes Chop
versus Deuces or something so uh I'm uh
checking oh he just had quartz
score for today's timing
zero
given ten six seven and the 910 all
didn't go away low frequency three back
low frequency three but now becomes a
high frequency three bet this because
we're stuck
foreign
this is an interesting flood Baron
it's very interesting vlog
I saw it with a check
and see what develops
he checks interesting
I'm gonna go for a check again
[Music]
I'm gonna go for the check results on
the river and then we go with uh
even in a better way against the burn
[Music]
is if he has a screen suited so
the bearing is just too good he's like
what is the wacko tripping me three
streets
the [ __ ] you know what other plays when
other players give up there you know you
just play the chicken sound but with the
baron you think like he's onto something
you know okay let's Revenge Baron come
on open the button ah now it doesn't
open now
the weko needs Aces to take revenge
versus the burn
small C
ibet very dicey
we make a little a little four bed
fruises are uh
play our chips and Crips it's uh feels
to me like a 10 percent team
that's what we're gonna do any snap
faults even 10 was too expensive that's
why he went to uh that's why he went to
Yellow I do know a flopping a set
is usually
a good way to make money
gotta play it slow this time
for the people who don't know how to
play pucker press guys people don't know
how to play Pokemon the last tip I have
for you is small pocket Pairs and these
are hands that you can win monster pots
so when you get Delta pocket pair try to
flop a set play it smooth now the
question is win all the money
how do we get all the money
I'm gonna go for the check race and get
all the money that way
what do you think cripsy
is Gavin's advice going to pay off
according to Gavin we should not just
ship
that's what I'm gonna do
King tin thank you Kevin this buy-in is
for you
honestly man
is buying is for you
I think the baron actually left the pool
so it's like 4-0 for the baron and he
left oh my God
title for the YouTube video Baron comes
in and absolutely destroys the weko and
here I'm gonna squeeze it up with the
ace Jack Suited
and I think this is an okay ten percent
turn King
so you're going to check
because we're mixing in a check here
we face it but
which you know if you check it's kind of
kind of what you're hoping for
sure we race shall we go
I think I'm just calling
River King River King is quite
interesting I'm gonna lead out
any faults
that was some funky stuff that was some
funky stuff
that was some funky stuff you're [ __ ]
dunk you do it again I remember in a
video before I've told you to not dunk
why do you do that
oh you do that so dumb and Aces
yes three green cards we don't have any
green cards so that means we check
about you
even more green cards that not good
that's not good believe it or not
actually I'm actually gonna think I'm
actually gonna draw a little bit now
it's a bit it's a bit funky guys it's a
bit funky but hey we're a funky player
any faults playing the flat call for the
people don't know how to flat go Works
incredibly strong
well we flopped the set the next tip I
want to tell you guys about is a super
Advanced concept your man raises
pre-flop
column I'm gonna start with a check flop
comes down he does his continuation bet
now you know that he's just as likely to
have missed the Flop As You Are
so here's where you can float the flop
you call his bet he'll check the turn
you can now use your position put in a
bet in steal that pot I have no clue
which clip we just played but
let's see if nacho is going to do
something funky here as I don't know if
some things were stuck yeah it was going
to be very hard to get some money so he
had Ace King so we kind of extracted the
most out of it well we get check race
here by Mr freezer
and we're gonna call
the very bad term
as you might imagine
but then again I don't expect to face a
very big bet so definitely think we can
call
indeed doesn't bet too big
interesting River if he had a head like
maybe Ace Jack with a diamond for
example he's now probably checking and
then we're winning so that's good
he doesn't ever go for the bat and I
think now it's very hard to find hands
that we're beating
Queen 9 for example his hand that he
could check race he's not gonna blast
that now
a six seven suited but something else
three bets so I'm just gonna fall do you
need some help playing three bad pots
and position well for that we have
classes in which we dedicate one
coaching program to dive very deep into
a specific spot go over to the side
poker mission.com masterclasses and
eliminate those weaknesses
Cafe is a little cold four bed here
shall we rip this in Pocket sixes oh I'm
feeling funky
I'm feeling funky guys
I'm feeding monkeys that's gonna ship it
in and go to bed
chippy didn't go to bed here we're
winning
you know when you feel like you have the
best hand to just gotta put the money
behind that feeling winning it twice
This Is How We Do It
gotta trash your gut guys gotta treasure
god [ __ ] my
make a little Barrel here hand Choice
wise the absolute not worst hand to do
it with but I just think uh
it's a spot where it's just very hard
for the imposition and I sometimes make
the nuts
like no
I think I should check
foreign
this is the second time
Mr freezer Mr freezer is not caring but
you know he's getting he's getting
chickens
[Music]
but apparently he's not giving any [ __ ]
yeah we're a little bit deep down
I do think I'm still gonna format but
probably four bet folding is that a
thing
is that a thing on the 30 B Bay deep
I don't know if that's a thing but I was
gonna do it eh no it's probably not a
thing
10 on this board that's the thing
some of the players do it to send money
back to their families as much as
possible
okay get check raced funky guyman is X
friendly he was a little bit off my
radar but I have to say actually if
you're watching
uh
you're a little bit of a crazy
[ __ ] I can respect that I can
respect for his [ __ ]
definitely sticking along though for at
least two streets so I don't know what
you're planning but
I have the best you better have a good
hand because
not really intending to go anywhere
now this is quite funky
basically the gems now he's saying is in
nuts
checks
I think we should just bet now
is he gonna have a jack
I think we should just bet Noah
yeah let's go for it
no snap call so that's good oh he had
the nuts oh
they're recreational got it images
we're always rooting for the
recreational we're betting Ace 10
rebetting Aces oh Sweden four bets
Swedish quite the craziest [ __ ]
actually should we go for the slow play
I go for the slow play
it's a good Flopper it's a good flop
this is how we flopping
go do your Sweden where are you from
Sweden
go to something Swedish
using a geometric sizings yes that's uh
maybe something that we learned
oh that's not a great River I could have
rivered the maze King let's say
optimistic guys let's say optimistic
or King Jack offers something
are we trapping
this is how we trapped him
[Music]
do I have do I have a slow play clip
no give it to me baby
right here I opened the fight for
students since my favorite hand
then people say you shouldn't have a
favorite hand
you can't believe those people
I have a flush draw
rattle King also decided to call so
there's a little danger in the air that
he could also have a flush rope it's a
little bit higher maybe this is why
usually if I first shoot it
no
usually we open a little bit a higher
type of suited cards but we do face a
barrel I don't think we can fold even if
rattle King calls
but it's gonna be very hard also to
extract value of our hand if we do hit
but hey these are problems for a later
scenario
okay these are problems for now
apparently
rattle King does decide to check
it's an okay play
foreign
like I said it's going to be hard to
extract value if we hit
and we can check and let him Bluff maybe
that's uh
it's a little bit better I don't know
if you formats I'm probably just gonna
trap
as he has shown that he can be capable
of King 3 Suited
so I guess calling
have it on the other side you know just
standing I'm gonna go for a call
and I would just basically go broke on
any board that's not
seven eight nine two tone or something
thank you
I'm just gonna call even though it's
quite dry you could make an argument for
raising
but like I said guys Sweden has a little
track record
he checks huh
it's interesting
you think that now he has something if
he checks let's find out
it's very odd also to have nothing here
so
and if he had completely nothing you
would have probably just went for it
right
dunks Queen jack off suit
don't want to scare him off I'm not that
too big
