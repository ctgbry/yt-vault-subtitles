[00:00]
uh I'm the guy that either wins 10
Stacks or loses 10 Stacks it's like it's
not like you end up break even all a
day was there any point where you uh
started think wait this is getting
serious money or did you always just
keep going next competition next
challenge was there any sort of

[00:15]
challenge was there any sort of
hesitation or self-doubt when the stakes
got start getting
higher um yeah before I answer the
question like want to add one more thing
like what you said before like like
having that right person helping you uh
really really big feel but I think um

[00:32]
really really big feel but I think um
it's like not like like like even if the
guy is like a genius like Yuri um like
having that guy in your life doesn't
like change you as like a poker player
yeah like you're not going to be great
like like two months later like it's

[00:45]
like like two months later like it's
still you have to still put into work
obviously so so that might have been
come a bit wrong well I've been answered
the question before but yeah it's like
obviously still have to put into work
but it's um it's it's it's it's a
combination of
both um yeah so for that

[01:01]
both um yeah so for that
question um definitely had that when
moving up uh that that I figured like
hey like w now swings are big like like
um like when when yeah let's say like
you play one can La NL like losing 10K

[01:18]
you play one can La NL like losing 10K
days close to Impossible I say uh and
like really really tough but um yeah
having having like the the five figur
Wings daily like when you play 2K it's
just normal and then going higher um

[01:33]
just normal and then going higher um
yeah it's it's just
like whenever whenever you it's new for
you I think that's that's really tough
like for me it was always that like when
I moved up like it's it's double the
money and I I always had like a bit of

[01:45]
money and I I always had like a bit of
that thing where the highest limit I
played is the one I perform the worst on
which is probably connected to to the
thing I mentioned before where where you
think like you have to be have to do
like something something weird there um
but yeah just just had it like recently

[02:01]
but yeah just just had it like recently
when when the sure you guys realized
that when the imagin kill games were
running like November
December uh yeah when you start to lose
like like 100k a day and more uh that's

[02:15]
like like 100k a day and more uh that's
really painful that's really really
painful and and and yeah especially when
when it's not like your daily limit
right like you play like 5K like 10K and
then suddenly you lose like like uh yeah
20 times that what you could lose nor

[02:30]
20 times that what you could lose nor
they um really really painful but on the
other
hand I kind of like the um like the
thrill you get from it like I've never
been like like the um yeah the biggest
knit when it came to to moving up or

[02:47]
knit when it came to to moving up or
like taking shots I mean I I watched a
bit of the stepen podcast and he said
like he was like always super super
conservative with money and and
Stakes I mean I'm I'd still say I'm
conservative but

[03:00]
conservative but
yeah I I like when it hurts in both
directions like losing and winning um so
break even break even sessions of the
worse H yeah for sure for sure I was
that URI always always told me that as

[03:15]
that URI always always told me that as
well like I'm the guy that either wins
10 Stacks or loses 10 Stacks it's like
it's not like you end up break even all
a
day yeah it sounds like you like the
highs and the lows the roller coaster
ride of emotions both good and bad and
yeah I think what was it was good what
you saying about basically it always

[03:31]
you saying about basically it always
kind of hurting when you're playing your
new highest stake and almost having to
build a bit of tolerance for that level
I think that's a very very common kind
of theme I say with poker players
there's almost no thought exercise you
can do there's not there's only so much

[03:45]
can do there's not there's only so much
preparation you can do when you play
your new highest level your shot taking
higher stake and you're going to
downswing there you're probably G to
have your biggest ever losing day and
that's normal and you need to be able to
suck that up and deal with it and just
realize this is just repetitions at some
point this will be normal this will feel

[04:00]
point this will be normal this will feel
fine but right now it doesn't because
this is a new experience and like if
there's no kind of cheating that
experience you just need to go through
it and I like from your personality type
it sounds like it's always triggered
something good in you so when you have a
big losing deer you always it triggers
your competitive drive it's almost like

[04:15]
your competitive drive it's almost like
the the pain of losing makes you want it
want it more maybe it's that competitive
nature of you getting triggered through
these losing sessions whereas other
people kind of don't have that I know
some players crumble when they have this
feeling and they have a lot of
self-doubt did you ever have self-doubt
during any wings of yours when you were

[04:31]
during any wings of yours when you were
also feeling like the competitive Drive
getting triggers but did that ever turn
into a a self-doubt period where you had
to reflect on what was happening yes for
sure for sure I mean it's it's not like
it's it's not like I I I go like to the

[04:45]
it's it's not like I I I go like to the
high lose four STS there and think like
okay great like tomorrow I go and study
like eight hours and and Crush those
guys obviously like obviously you're
frustrated after that it's like I think
it would be really bad if wasn't that

[05:00]
it would be really bad if wasn't that
way like I mean it still still shows
that you care a lot about it
and it's like you said it's super
painful and there's no way around that
experience I think every one of us had
that experience that experience is
probably here to come for every one of

[05:16]
probably here to come for every one of
us again and again and again um but yeah
the the thing is like maybe not in the
moment where it is maybe not a day after
but like like two or three days after
that you put it in a rational
perspective and think okay like this is

[05:32]
perspective and think okay like this is
going to happen this is nothing special
like this is I lost four or five Stacks
this is totally normal on my daily limit
this is totally normal there my win rate
is probably worse in a higher game than
it is on a lower game it it's going to

[05:47]
it is on a lower game it it's going to
happen like you knew it before like like
if if you let's say you take a shot
obviously everybody thinks or dreams
about like okay I'm taking a shot I'm
winning five Stacks great best feeling
in the world I mean there's a decent

[06:00]
in the world I mean there's a decent
chance that it goes like like this way
there's a decent chance it goes the
other way and you and you have like the
worst experience in your poke career at
that point and um yeah yeah I think put
it in a rational perspective afterwards
put in the work and at some point come

[06:16]
put in the work and at some point come
back stronger like doesn't have to be
tomorrow doesn't have to be like next
next 10 sessions
but let it be next half year like at
some point you'll be back and you'll be
there yeah it almost comes down to uh

[06:30]
there yeah it almost comes down to uh
almost like what next so you experience
a downswing and a new stake it hurts
like hell for everyone but then what
next like how do you use that fuel do
you use that to uh like you said put
into perspective and tell yourself okay
it's only few buyings I've got this
covered over next six months do you use

[06:46]
covered over next six months do you use
that fuel to go in the lab and work on
your game and start trying to find
solutions to uh to level up and yeah I
think it's very interesting to see the
kind of what next and for you it might
not be instant like I think a lot of
players are going to get frustrated a
bit of self-doubt in the short term but
it's more important how you're using
that over the long frame how you're

[07:01]
that over the long frame how you're
using that over days over weeks over
months how your attitude your approach
changes during that period And when
you're feeling those feelings those
insecurities that self-doubt that
frustration that annoyance that you're
not achieving your goals how do you use
that how do you use that as fuel or put

[07:16]
that how do you use that as fuel or put
in perspective so you can get back to a
steady Baseline so yeah think a really
important important lesson there all
right I got a question for you around
one the one of the quiz questions we ask
is quite a fun one are you someone who
likes to play it safe or are you a
gambler and you you said you're a lared
heart and you also tick the box for YOLO

[07:31]
heart and you also tick the box for YOLO
mentality so I want to ask if you got
any stories about being a risk taker any
risks that you've taken in the past that
would be a good story to share in terms
of your journey through poker or maybe
even outside of Poker any any times
you've been a

[07:45]
you've been a
gambler
um I mean the probably the the only real
bad story I have is the one I told
already where where half SP it up and
then then lost it all back um

[08:00]
then then lost it all back um
it's yeah I'm not like like a beach and
gambler or something like I I don't like
casino games or like everything but but
um what I said before like I like to
Thrill like like if if I'm doing
something with friends like and there's
a abill to flip for or there's something

[08:16]
a abill to flip for or there's something
like like I need it in my daily life to
to to like to have that deal like I
would I would love to flip with my
girlfriend for dinner if we out but so
so yeah just need the
the yeah the daily the daily flip it

[08:32]
the yeah the daily the daily flip it
doesn't have to be for a real amount of
money it's just like like um yeah when
we're together with friends and yeah we
we order pizza and we flip for it like
it it hurts me to lose that 60 bucks if
I lose the flip it's like that's I don't

[08:46]
I lose the flip it's like that's I don't
know like I I just like I just like
flipping I just like yeah whatever
basically Ser like like the the higher
the better on that's yeah um but but but
never something that is like yeah that's

[09:00]
never something that is like yeah that's
like really stupid and I don't think I
have like
in when it comes to real life or
Investments all like like like like I'm
not a punter de like I'm I'm not really
spending money on on anything like just

[09:15]
spending money on on anything like just
like your regular everyday guy I think
and um yeah but but but when when I get
a chance to have a Sero EV flip like I'd
be down to like do it for whatever's
possible but yeah I think it's really um

[09:32]
possible but yeah I think it's really um
interesting to be able to have kind of
both perspectives where you want to
gamble on kind of zero AV flips but at
the same time you're very calculated
with what you do professionally as as a
poker player also you talk about your
Investments as well like you don't have

[09:45]
Investments as well like you don't have
those characteristics showing up in like
kind of dangerous places that could
derail you it's almost like a fun thing
it's like I I like the Thrills when I
can but you know when to have that in
the right place and I think some players
who have this kind of the YOLO mentality
in the I'm the gambl at heart often push

[10:00]
in the I'm the gambl at heart often push
cross boundaries where they that'll go
into their their professional life and
they'll start taking risks with their
bankr which they shouldn't be taking
which you did as well when you're
younger or they start taking on
investments which are super high risk
with like a a big chance of failure when
they not red for it so yeah I think it's
understand that's part of my personality

[10:15]
understand that's part of my personality
and where can you get those kind of
Thrills almost for free the Z EV kind of
$60 with your dinner with your
girlfriends kind of dinners where you
can get that kind of thrill so I think
it's really good to uh understand that
part of your personality because if you
tried to Cave that let's say for you who
said okay just don't be a gambler don't

[10:30]
said okay just don't be a gambler don't
take any of these kind of thrill seeking
moments you'd probably like suppress it
for a while and it would probably come
out in a more kind of destructive way so
it's actually pretty good that you've
got these kind of daily Outlets where
you're allowing yourself to uh to have
that Yol mentality so yeah good stuff I
mean when when you're professional right

[10:46]
mean when when you're professional right
you have that yeah you have that mindset
anyway like like if you like if if if
you really want to like like take big
big risks at stuff you know is negative
be maybe over think you're profession I

[11:00]
be maybe over think you're profession I
don't know like like like this will at
some point maybe also hurt your poker
game or like like your like you said
like H your bank roll like I don't know
like like you can't get like you said
the the the F for for free it's like you

[11:15]
the the the F for for free it's like you
get so much the stuff out there and yeah
take all of that I'm always taking that
but but no nothing
