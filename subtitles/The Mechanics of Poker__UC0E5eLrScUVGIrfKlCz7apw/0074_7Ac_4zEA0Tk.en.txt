[00:00]
main block for taxi i think would be
especially for this sizing would be a
hand like
six seven so we don't want to block that
oh then we have ace ten first six seven
y range if you can just put people

[00:17]
y range if you can just put people
on a goddamn hand

today
i'm doing good i'm doing good the meal
also guys i was working on the

[01:01]
also guys i was working on the
a little musk class yes the master class
on uh
during check race vs high steppers gto
queen 549
this is the sheet from the small blind
versus
big blind master class we're going to
talk a little bit about exploitation as

[01:16]
talk a little bit about exploitation as
here exploiting the population
turn blocking betrayed betting okay some
exploited stuff in there some gto stuff
in there i have to say guys it's
starting to look
very nice very nice going for a small
race they're quite deep

[01:30]
race they're quite deep
did they already check the flop or was
it the
especially especially at higher stakes
where
for example opens 2.2 probably out of
position is even defending
ace for off

[01:46]
is defending any two suited cards in
this region
so probably a spot where maybe even
defending um by far off is maybe a
little bit too
too too much but definitely a spot where
attacks here
on a two-tone board deuce five it's

[02:01]
on a two-tone board deuce five it's
gonna already slow down a little bit but
actually i think he decided to slow down
here on the turn and then raise the
river
i'm not mistaking definitely don't mind
checking here let's say for example we
haven't had like ace king or something
it's a fine check and now raise the

[02:16]
it's a fine check and now raise the
river i think it's a fine play
richard is here for the chicken song i
do have to say guys
chicken song on this table with helm
with 464 taxi muniz
dex i don't think there's gonna be

[02:30]
dex i don't think there's gonna be
a lot of chicken songs right i think
there's gonna be way more incredibly
strong
and aggressive play way more strong and
aggressive plays today
like this one the river race quite a
strong and aggressive play
i might say where are you watching this
wacko this is

[02:45]
wacko this is
as you can see here source twitch but tv
high sex poker stream
go give the guy a follow then you can
re-watch
previous streams and he likes to real
high stakes
and then what i do i record the session

[03:01]
and then what i do i record the session
and i'm here to review it
and we have to send you guys over to his
channel if you want to
look back watch back more high sex
footage
we are gonna see some donkey donkeys or
riots okay okay

[03:16]
riots okay okay
i cannot i cannot really promise the
donkey donkeys let me see do i know
any of these players like to do donkey
donkey
you know not everyone has that donkey
donkey donkey skills in them right
it's uh it's a very very advanced play

[03:30]
it's uh it's a very very advanced play
very advanced play
something that people don't really [ __ ]
with you know but you know we had a spot
so if i see a spot for a little donkey
donkey i will uh
definitely let you guys know and educate
you i'm probably one of the few coaches
that would advocate dunk betting

[03:45]
that would advocate dunk betting
strategies
so if you want to learn dongbang
strategies i'm the guy you call
okay a 333 board i think he's also doing
a lot of small betting but i think on
this board he could
up his sizing a little bit and he's

[04:00]
up his sizing a little bit and he's
indeed going for a half spot
and we got a little half pot here on the
river which makes a lot of sense as well
check to check
uh i don't think muniz has a lot of
blossom
basically dex is the person that is

[04:15]
basically dex is the person that is
still unkept
as he will still or potentially
it's way more likely that he's checking
twice with very strong hands
than munis so
um therefore usually the imposition

[04:30]
um therefore usually the imposition
doesn't use
all too big of sizings uh and even if
you have a very strong end let's say you
do a vases you don't want to go too big
and discourage any action lions and odbf
dunk bets in their strategy
yes they do i think it was in one of the
last high stakes rules that

[04:45]
last high stakes rules that
uh flop linus got from the small blind
flop game
queen seven four and lioness
regular watcher of the wacko show
apparently
he threw a little donkey donkey and then
in the end for the people remember we

[05:00]
in the end for the people remember we
played a little chicken song
yeah it still increases all the way down
to ace king deuce not like i said on the
ace king deuce
but the ace king 8 ace king 6 don't
understand

[05:16]
five nine deuce a one third
it's probably the least preferred sizing
but the text here is definitely uh
someone who likes to use the one-third
sizing more frequently
then for example if you're going to use
one-third a lot on these kind of boards

[05:31]
one-third a lot on these kind of boards
bad three betting for example becomes an
important part of your strategy
and in general knowing how to play
against check races because that will
happen quite often
check check expect to see a lot of small
bets here from us
and right when i said that he bets the

[05:45]
and right when i said that he bets the
three quarters three quarters i think is
gonna be
reserved mainly i think for a hand like
king queen or something
just to name one exact hand

[06:06]
just to name one exact hand
i personally play a lot from small bat
here in this spot
small bat or maybe even a bigger bet
don't really like to use these

[06:15]
don't really like to use these
kind of sizes in these kind of spots too
often
we actually face a race and we saw this
uh
on the other spot as well right from the
other position
so decks here definitely uh pumping up
bumping up that river aggression here

[06:34]
bumping up that river aggression here
and yeah i was gonna say what what would
be good bluffing hands from taxi
probably you want to
exactly block those hands that we just
mentioned right the
the top pairs so king jack is a good

[06:46]
the top pairs so king jack is a good
candidate
i was thinking ace king could also be a
good candidate especially at that stag
that maybe he will three bet ace queen
off a little bit
less i don't know if if the taxi will
have jams but

[07:00]
have jams but
and sauce made uh interesting float on
the flop 593
or at least interesting you could also
check race
don't think folding is really an option
jack five deuce
i've studied quite a little small big
night aboard that uh

[07:17]
night aboard that uh
you should slow down on a little bit
i think a lot of people were on
on gto correctly over sea battle spots
bought by big blind
except for like the low connected type

[07:30]
except for like the low connected type
of boards i think most people
just check range ish he does now decide
to check
and i think taxi should do some small
bets he goes for the half pot
which i think if someone oversee bats i

[07:45]
which i think if someone oversee bats i
think i would prefer a little bit of
smaller sizing here
but hey we don't know that of of munis
i think a lot of the hands that you are
you might want to bet

[08:00]
you might want to bet
are worth this amount a five
or like ace three or like six three
because i think muniz could bet any ace
10 ace queen ace king
and check all the turn

[08:15]
and a three quarter sizing on the river
main block for taxa i think would be
special for this sizing would be a hand
like
six seven seven
eight let me see is that a gutter on a
turn no it's like something the six six
eight six seven i think those would be

[08:33]
eight six seven i think those would be
his
primary bloss so we don't want to block
that
oh then we have ace 10 first six seven
why range if you can just put people

[08:47]
why range if you can just put people
on a goddamn hand okay
how sick is that how sick is that oh my
god
am i the best it's a minute sid say it
you have to say it and muniz actually

[09:00]
you have to say it and muniz actually
has an excellent block catcher
uh since he's blocking jack 10 and he's
blocking h4
and he's unblocking the he's unblocking
the the
the blas like i said which were mainly
at the lower region do you need some
help playing three bad pots out of

[09:15]
help playing three bad pots out of
position
well for that we have created our master
classes
in which we dedicate one coaching
program to dive very deep into a
specific spot
go over to the site pokermission.com
master classes
and eliminate those weaknesses let me

[09:30]
and eliminate those weaknesses let me
see
okay very connected board
half pot
my preferred strategy an eight turn ah
this could be it guys
this could be it is he gonna draw a

[09:46]
this could be it is he gonna draw a
little donkey donkey
i checks he doesn't listen he doesn't
even listen to the echo
he listens to a mystery [ __ ] dunk you
do it again i remember in a video before
i've told you to not

[10:00]
i've told you to not
dunk why do you do that why do you do
that
so dumb okay heard it here first
helmuts coached by gordon
so now the river is an eighth so zos is

[10:16]
so now the river is an eighth so zos is
gonna check back
like some over pairs
and an over pair here is quite a strong
hand right it's very unlikely for your
opponent to have an 8 as he could have
maybe dunked it down the turn

[10:31]
maybe dunked it down the turn
and it's just statistically speaking
combo combo torquely speaking
it's very unlikely so now zos can
suddenly have some jams
as we suddenly have quite a lot of boats

[10:45]
as we suddenly have quite a lot of boats
we have a snap fold of helmuts who is
who was probably just bluffing
so again and this is usually what you
will see in terms of
my people bluff etc it's usually
because the spot makes sense from a

[11:00]
because the spot makes sense from a
range
advantage perspective and then hand wise
they usually have some sort of hand like
we saw with taxa right
that blocks his value
this is kind of the you could say the

[11:16]
this is kind of the you could say the
mathematics i haven't i've never
actually read that book the mathematics
of poker
but you could say that these are like
the mathematics of poker why so much
meme raising new meta
i think somewhere between min
and two and a half is in general the

[11:31]
and two and a half is in general the
most frequent race is used
and usually what most players i think do
is the earlier you are the more they
start that min and then the later you go
you up your sizing i think that's the
most common
trend in terms of raising

[11:47]
but over the years we've seen everything
a little better to put a little better
from helmut's
don't really know if he also has a
flatting range or if he plays through
that only
it does kind of change your strategy

[12:03]
but that's more because your range kind
of changes
but i see most players most players they
they they like to just use three battle

[12:16]
they they like to just use three battle
a lot
as we all know i'm a little bit more of
the flat call okay okay we have a four
belt pot
all right and then we also of course
have the youtube stuff we have the
academy stuff we have other pokemon
stuff
we have the table team also for winning

[12:30]
we have the table team also for winning
poker
i used to have it but they changed
something they're not allowing uh custom
mods anymore for butt per
bot detection i believe
before about c bets probably just range

[12:50]
call ace is a very interesting turn
would say we want to implement some
checks
let's say we have ace five suited or
let's say we have aces
don't think we want to be betting those

[13:00]
don't think we want to be betting those
hands
we might bet again with nothing i would
personally approach this spot a little
bit more
a little bit more polarized i'm trying
to think of a hand that i might
okay he goes for a very small bat could
indicate that he's just going to bed

[13:15]
indicate that he's just going to bed
range again
which is also an option but
yeah because like helmuts will have
eight
nines tents which we don't have um
so yeah he's putting a lot of pressure
on him right

[13:30]
he won't really for example we can have
aceton off he would have folded a stand
of diamonds so from just a range
perspective i would say
barreling a lot makes sense but i do
think especially the closer we come
towards kings
we're gonna be checking more and then
add aces and h5

[13:47]
add aces and h5
but let's say he does have jacks
like the jack of hearts
jackards jack of spades or something
before
okay he was thinking about it is he
thinking about a little donkey dunking

[14:00]
thinking about a little donkey dunking
like a [ __ ]
7 8 got there i guess that could be how
you can counter the
too much betting with jax type of
stretch
okay thought about for quite a while
interesting interesting tank

[14:15]
interesting interesting tank
no [ __ ] clue
and he did have the queens with the
queen of spades and he did think about a
bluff
yeah so every time my read is one off
it's a little bit disappointing so like
queens

[14:30]
he didn't block the queen the when i was
looking at jax i was looking
at a jack that blocks ajax suited maybe
he just always calls ice queen
who knows then obviously queens is quite
good
and he can get some value out of draws

[14:46]
so yeah i think it's a it's a fine
strategy
and he was thinking about a little
donkey on the river [ __ ]
but yeah i think you know he just gets
good odds on the turn and tries to
outdraw him

[15:01]
outdraw him
i knew he would have had 10 jack of
spades it would have been very unlikely
for me to put him on jax
where does mma play i think he mainly
plays gg nowadays
and acr and also mainly in uh

[15:15]
in nighttime so when uh my eyes are
closed
he's taking in the money from what i
believe
a check on the 10 deuce five
check again on the ace

[15:33]
expect a bigger size bet half
pot i would have gone a little bit
bigger but okay
yeah i think this hand could bat a
little bit bigger i wanted to go for the

[15:45]
little bit bigger i wanted to go for the
checkers on flop which makes sense
didn't bet the turn so that's why i
thought maybe like king jack plus is
probably your river betting range so i
think that's like worth a bit more than
half
did flusho and other study mates of
yours took
a look at the mechanics program

[16:02]
a look at the mechanics program
yes they did i obviously i asked them
for
inputs on various various topics
why the small bet on this board though
i mean why not i mean if you go to a

[16:17]
i mean why not i mean if you go to a
solver and you say
bat wandered only he will give you the
gto strategy for one-third only
i mean taxier i think is one of the
biggest winners

[16:30]
biggest winners
on high stakes so don't let that be disa
courage you know you don't have to use
the most gto sizing i do think
personally
uh i like to use some big bets but
obviously it makes the tree a little bit
more complex especially on later streets

[16:47]
more complex especially on later streets
does he call this doesn't he call that
so maybe you will have a less
accurate read of what's going on
jack95 is a good board to split small
and big yes i completely agree

[17:01]
and big yes i completely agree
below the board usually a bigger the
smaller sizing kind of
uh goes down in value
german check check what what the [ __ ]
went on there

[17:15]
gg gg they're already saying it before
the hand is played out
okay so we have a check on this ace
queen 9

[17:30]
which personally
i uh i like to do a lot of checking here
on this board
i use more of a polarized strategy which
i'm gonna explain to you
how i like to approach a spot but

[17:45]
how i like to approach a spot but
more importantly because a lot of people
you know they always love to talk about
flop sizing more
importantly i'm gonna explain you why i
think certain sizings are preferred and
how those kind of strategies play out on
later streets because you can use a
certain strategy on the flop because the
solvers say so
but if you then punt enough later on

[18:02]
but if you then punt enough later on
and make huge errors that trendy is
probably not going to be winning

[18:15]
probably not going to be winning
at poker vision what do you expect from
the high stakes cash games over little
action and few
apocalypses what do you expect from the
high stakes cash games
over little action and few recreationals
i didn't really understand the question

[18:31]
i didn't really understand the question
yeah i feel like he's playing
differently i like to look at tech
series hands from a year ago and compare
them
that's uh so then check
check check check check river

[18:46]
a lot of hands want to check again
so i would say big bet check
i'm looking at the situation right now

[19:02]
or these big three quarters is big oh
he goes very big 900 that's
i guess also an option is in line with
my philosophy how i like to approach
these kind of boards

[19:18]
you don't play on gg games are always
running there no i currently don't play
on gg
i will in the in the future
munis can go probably uh as wide as

[19:31]
munis can go probably uh as wide as
any ace x i would say
the five doesn't really improve helmets
except for king 5 suited
queen 5 suited 9-5 suited
and every time when i say suited it
means it's not a lot of combinations

[19:51]
he actually had the queen five suited
which
i would say i prefer a check race with
this hand
