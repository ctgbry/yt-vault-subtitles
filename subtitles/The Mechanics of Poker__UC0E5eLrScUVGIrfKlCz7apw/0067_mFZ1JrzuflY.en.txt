sign up to our newsletter so you don't
miss out on any
new promotions we are going to continue
where we left
off which was mikey boyfin
this time he didn't have food coming
which michael boyfin
eats a lot apparently because he usually
has food coming at some point
and then he has to take a little break
but this time guys
it was his washing machine for not
mistaking so apparently he had some
clothes in the washing machine
and uh priorities guys priorities
right i think it was at this table
somewhere around the 30 minute mark
do you give away all of your general
poker insights in the mechanics of poker
or do you keep some
for yourself no i give away all my
insight like i said
i give away my philosophy and how i
approach the game
i give you all the ingredients all the
mechanics
but in the end what you have to get good
at
and what poker clue is very good at to
learn how to estimate the situations
and then deviate from the base
the baseline which is you know good
fundamental poker
aka gto but the word gto now there's a
bunch of baggage some people have
gto blah blah blah and people also
interpreted it in a different way
so i would say i explain you everything
that's needed behind how to make
higher ev decisions how ev is generated
in certain strategies
but in the end it's up to you to
estimate in-game
what is the highest ev play so i teach
you which
what kind of variables you have to look
for the ingredients as i call them
and then from there it's up to you to
analyze at the table
what is relevant for example if you're
playing against a very aggressive player
okay a question that i always tell
people to ask themselves where should my
ev come from
well if you're playing versus a very
aggressive player what do you do
you go check it check you feel home with
style and you let the guy bluff off
right if you're playing against a super
aggressive wheel that's what you do
very extreme and then obviously the
difference is
that is for example what the better
players do better right they estimate
the situation
and understand how that situation will
generate ev where their evs
come from with their hand then obviously
the higher you go the more nuances they
add
okay so it's not like i get
i explain you all the fundamentals that
you need the same fundamentals
poker kluka uses obviously poker clue
has a couple of things
that you know like a little spidey sense
here and there he can dodge bullets like
phil how much out of to phil hellmuth
but it's more the more the higher you go
it's more in the nuances and also it's
in the consistency
uh being able to consistently execute
those things right here actually we have
a little four bad pot
ace jack tree let's see how poker
approaches his board
in theory he actually should be checked
quite often
he goes for the 10 which is a valid
strategy as well
actually the ace jack 3 probably gets
bad at ok frequency
10 is fine and he squeezes the linus
so the click the clickbank is
interesting um
you could say that calling in the small
blind
it's not necessary you don't really have
to do it uh
in a balanced way because it's a little
bit more
the responsibility of the button to
defend correctly and prevent you from
squeezing it's not necessarily
you in a small blind that has to mix it
up there are some spots where i do like
flatting
and certain hands that i do look
flatting
but i don't really know how lioness
approaches that situation actually we
get a little fault a little bluffy here
or at least a little nice check right
here from jasm and luke lays it down on
the hdx3 we got a clickwork guys we got
a [ __ ] click war going on
so call small blind squeeze
double the race clicky clicky up to
linus
to be continued poker clue fearless guy
and we get a call okay this is very
interesting
and i guess queens in a skin could be in
and what is he clicking back though the
the five bet
wait call squeeze three bath four bed
five bed the small click and back five
bed is is
it yeah it's always interesting uh
i personally wouldn't have i think
a five bed range here
but hey maybe aces i would say that your
five bed range
doesn't i would say you want to do zero
c betting on this board
so i expect to check back because
basically asus
doesn't really want to see that kings
doesn't really want to see bat
and those are going to be the majority
of your five bed range if you did add
queens oh you probably also don't want
to see that
if you did have ace king you probably
also don't want to see that if you have
a bluff
you probably also want to see that so i
would expect a range check but luka
likes the ten percent
which normally let's say for example it
was uh a race
a three bed and a cold format i like a
ten percent on this board
but i think when it's cooled five bed
stuff i
don't like what betting achieves
but hey linus fault and this is the
thing right most probably he now folded
a low pair or six seven of diamonds
do you really want that when you have a
skin or asus or queens
i don't think so we have linus c
building a little three quarters both
mikey boyfriend and lioness like to use
this strategy
oh michael i told you like above you
there's food coming or it's a dishwasher
or it's a washing machine
but the food is coming up next time okay
so we have a call
the three shouldn't be that improving
um maybe a little bit
the thing is it's not necessarily people
might want to lead i see a lot of people
they sort of lead because the board
pairs
it's not exactly how it works and the
elite range which is also not how it
works
but to have a leading range here does
make sense but not with all your hands
so here is the lead a little 150 which i
think is fine
you can go very small here because a lot
of hands in linus is
linus love his range will have zero
percent equity let's say he has king
jack
and my boyfriend has a three yeah you're
dead
so basically because the amount of
equity
a three has versus his random overcards
from
from that perspective you can lead quite
small
now i would expect
mike boffin to go pick or
check and then he bet small yeah sure
why not
he has exactly a 10 yeah with exactly a
10 that does make sense but
so here's the thing he bets three
quarters on the flop
your ability to value bet this hand
really depends on
how linear
his c betting range is the more steep
bending ranges i think the more
our hand becomes a check on the river
interesting spot here uh ace king four
six if i'm not mistaken it was jason who
opened line is recalled
okay called m boyfriend called and we
get now a lead for a small sizing
this is something that if you play heads
up you won't have a small sizing here
but multi-way um
probably what mikey boson is thinking is
is that if he uses
just a big sizing he cannot bet enough
and then basically six cards will
realize so
i think he prefers to have a little bit
of higher betting frequency for a small
sizing
in general so when you play multi-way
you can reduce your sizings
because also you want to bet a little
bit more frequently
ah okay a good comment from uh
mr ryu mata roberts four month
subscriber three months batch
shout out to that guy man hashtag
loyalty
he says shouldn't your default game plan
be more exploitive than actual gto
this is interesting of course you learn
how poker really works from a
theoretical perspective
then you interpret what happens in
practice
then you can make the conversion okay
like for example there's a lot of people
that
simplify their strategy they arrange
sibe because the population is
overfolding in a certain spot
for example that's an example of oh gto
has to check back blah blah blah blah
blah blah because you know if he bets
his hand he will get raised too often oh
if he doesn't race we can just bet his
hand
so therefore our default strategy is to
range bet in a certain spot
which gto didn't do but because of the
population
you decided to uh up your cbet frequency
for example this is a good example of
a practical strategy you understood why
theory didn't say range c-bet but you
had new information
leading you to range c-bat your default
strategy
yeah probably like mda rack would do but
this is also again the problem
then you get into the mda camp and
they're again too much in the nda
train okay there's there's valid in both
for example in the mechanics i talk
about uh
population i talk about specific reads i
talk about gto
i talk about everything gets discussed
because you cannot find answers in
in in one corner sometimes you will find
the answer in the mda sometimes you find
the answer in the solver sometimes you
don't find answer in any of both
and you just have to talk to a friend to
get a new perspective of how to look at
a spot
okay do you need some help playing three
bad pots out of position
well for that we have created our master
classes
in which we dedicate one coaching
program to dive very deep into a
specific spot
go over to the site pokermission.com
master classes
and eliminate those weaknesses linus
checks the flop and now pots the turn
these guys in all the games that we've
seen they like to use the pot i
ready to never use pot but again
it's not necessarily the bad sizing here
for example i would prefer to again
my philosophy plays a little bit more
from a small but than a big bet
because i have a certain objective i'll
play poker hands
and i feel like big bad small bad type
of strategies
allow me to better reach my objective
but hey
like i said execution is the most
important thing and i'm sure we can
leave it up the line is to execute his
strategy
in the right way so he puts basically
saying that
i checked i still have a lot of strong
hands because we're playing out of
position so
trapping is actually a thing oh gluca
checks back he's the imposition player
trapping is
less of a thing so when it goes check
check
basically linus has the advantage in
nuts and therefore he can use big
sizings
and he can get he can go reasonably
thinner actually it's a spot where poker
glucose should be checking back
quite some strongest hands like king
jack queen jack jack 10
ace jack these are ants actually that
get checked at a decent frequency which
something that i for example recently
kind of found out
and now the goal is not to start doing
that the goal is to try to understand
why they why that is the case and then
see if that if you should actually do
that as well
so look at goals okay let's get this
ring the queen i think is a
little bit of a divided card i think
both players could have hand like king
queen
both players could have jack queen all
players could have king ten
pink 108 is a bit more likely for
klueger to just bat flop
a screen doesn't bad turn this way but
obviously lion still has advantage in
over pairs and sets
so i would expect lioness to still do
the most of the betting
i wouldn't expect a huge sizing too
often
but maybe it just goes for pot again but
i wouldn't mind just going three
quarters now
with some now again like i
immediately leaned towards again a big
bat and a small bat
but let's see what linus does i mean
clue guys still so he goes for pot again
which this is kind of his thing
you can see michael boyfin and linus
they uh they kind of approach poker in a
similar way
and i remember for example this is also
a difference
back in the day if you look at the otb
strategy and linus strategy otb
would have literally four sizings he
could just come up with any type of
sizing you had no clue what to expect
which was
very hard to play against right then
when would you
play linus you would always know what to
expect
because you would you often use one
sizing strategies
in basically every spot so you kind of
knew what to expect in terms of sizing
but he was just so good
in playing putting the right hands in
his bed and in his bed
in his check and putting the right
frequency
that it was still like it in my opinion
it felt
easier to play against but obviously it
wasn't
it's different
while the communication this time is on
they're clearly saying last
so poker click i shouldn't get too angry
here
and mikey boffin is gonna go after linus
in the last hand
we're going to face quite some barrels
here linus is in for some pressure
oh he checks interesting maybe
it does it just in style but he has now
set knights
just like justin tried to trap lines
with the with the pocket tents but lions
are in binding guys lions save money
check back from linus 10 i would say is
better for linus in general
kind of depends we are playing versus
cut off versus button definitely
definitely like that okay checks
like ace jack of spades ace queen of
spades something like that
or just a a nine
he doesn't have that much knight he's
nice suited or something
he can definitely still have pocket
nines
rocket sevens go for the check race just
like jason plant
ace queen of spades so my first read was
correct
yeah ice cream makes a lot of sense to
play this way and
uh lioness check back to 10 actually i
was in a similar spot where i actually
value better this hand
and i got called by pocket queens and
actually i was wondering to myself
was my very best a bit too tin actually
it was a little bit different though
the river was a blank and i had pocket
tents and the guy check called queens
and i thought
yeah he never has a better hand anymore
so i think actually that's
gonna be the end yes that is the end of
the video
okay i did i just did 30 minutes 30
minutes but apparently there was a big
break where there's nothing in the
middle
so we're done a little bit earlier if
you guys have any questions
does how much green tea and dark
chocolate you have influence when it's
time to go all in
and go to bed [ __ ] i think
i think the right one is ship it and go
to bed i think it's just time to ship it
in and go to bed
all right guys that's gonna be it good
news by the way
for the people who didn't didn't know
but uh pokestars thought uh
given the fact that we were crushing so
hard we were almost gto
that they decided to do a little routine
check
and from what i was told the routine
check was almost finished and i could
start playing again next week so i hope
i'm gonna take a one week break so i
hope i will do
at least one more normal playing
stream session next week so yeah then we
can uh
then we can get back to playing i will
do it anyway
whether that's gonna be on pokestars or
not but i think it
should be resolved next week as i
concluded
that my mind is just very gto and not my
computer or my rta
