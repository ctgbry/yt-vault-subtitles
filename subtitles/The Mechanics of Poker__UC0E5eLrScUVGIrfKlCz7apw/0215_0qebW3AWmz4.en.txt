in this series I will be reviewing hands
that I played that I thought were
interesting and that I wanted to share
with you guys so expect Dunkey Dunkey
fancy plays hero calls big Bluffs and
everything in between let's get into the
first hand where we play a three uput in
position versus a recreational player
with 7 six suited we see a flop of King
Jack 8 and we decide to go for a seabat
of half pot straight away actually I
find this quite interesting I think King
Jack a twoone and versus recreationals
in general I think there's quite a lot
of opportunities here to use very
exploitive strategy where we want to be
betting our Bluffs for a small sizing
and our value hands for a big sizing now
why is that I think kingj 82 tone is a
board that VIN is going to respond quite
in elastic on so that means that
regardless of the BET size he's going to
continue a reasonably similar frequency
okay and how can we exploit that well by
betting our value big and our Bluffs
small because you think about it if he
has like two undercards or a low pair or
like some Ren a high that has nothing
he's generally going to fold whereas if
he has Queen 10 he's never folding if he
has 910 he's never folding I guess the
only hands that would be sort of elastic
I guess are maybe like something like 86
suited maybe he will decide to fold that
if we go too big and had like Ace five
of Hearts I guess would be a bit elastic
but uh I think hpot here kind of misses
the point I think I would have liked to
see myself betting one3 and then which
your value bet very big well wo that's
very exploitative yes I know that is
very exploitive we're playing for a
recreational player who's not thinking
about our strategies only looking at his
hand and because he's only looking at
his hand that offers us opportunities to
exploit him but we see that half pot
fing calls and it turn is a deuce of
hearts and he checks towards us now this
is a very interesting spot in terms of
how do we want to construct our betting
range mainly in terms of do we want to
be barreling Equity hands or non-equity
Holdings the thing with three pots in
position lower spr and also fors
recreational players on boards that are
double flush draw this is a general
tendency of population that you will see
on double flusher board raise
percentages on turns are usually the
highest now when a board becomes wet
like this and spr becomes low getting
raised is a real threat and we have to
adjust our range construction
accordingly so anytime we have a hand
that when it bats and it faces a rise it
has to puke because it has to fold
meaning that you know you have a decent
amount of equity like the draw that we
have here you usually don't really want
to be betting that hand so I thought in
game I had like six seven of Spades
would definitely be a check and I
thought six seven of Hearts would
probably also be a check I think this is
spot where we want to be barreling very
aggressively with hands like six seven
of clubs or six seven of diamonds okay
now people are thinking hey wo I would
prefer to have six seven of Hearts right
because it has more equity and yes yes
it's true obviously it has a higher EV
embedding than for example six seven of
diamonds but if you think this way
you're missing the point because the EV
of checking with 67 of Hearts is
obviously also way higher than the EV of
checking with 67 of diamonds because 67
of diamond EV of checking is quite low
because you have nothing okay and the EV
of your play has to outperform the other
alternative within that same hand
category so six seven of diamond has to
compare the EV of betting 67 of diamonds
compared to the EV of checking 67 of
diamonds okay and then I would say um
six7 of diamonds usually wants to bet
and we the plan then is to Triple off in
general versus recreational players they
overall draws on two streets so let's
say has hand like nine1 off Queen 10 off
Ace 10 off Ace Queen any flush draw he's
probably going to be over calling them
on the turn and therefore what you will
see is that recreationals in uh when
they're out of position they fall a lot
to Triple barrels and this is one
contributor the other contributor is the
fact that they will sometimes lead
strong hands okay when for example draws
come in they tend to lead when they have
made their draw all right
so I actually did go for the barrel I'm
not a huge fan of this like I said I
would have preferred a check for reasons
that I just explained villan does go
ahead and make the call now my plan was
already with 67 of hearts that was going
to trip off let's say you have something
like 9x hearts or 9x of space or 10 x of
space 10x hearts these are hands that
you definitely want to be checking
because then you're also blocking like
some of the potential folding range
let's say as queen9 off like some
gutters 107 107 suited or something like
that so that's another thing to take in
consideration at some point your draw
becomes this good let's say you have n a
Hearts n a Spades or queen a Hearts
Queen Spades they they are so good that
you can just bet and if you raises you
just call it off okay so that's kind of
the flipping point so be careful with
the medium draws I'd
say now river is a tree of Spades my
plan here was to Triple off when he
checks because like I said I think he
has a lot of out of faults in in his
range Queen 10 Ace 10 Ace Queen
910 however he decides to dunk now I
just I just talked about why triple
Browning in position for fors a
recreation is good because you know they
have these out of faults and they lead
out when they have a strong hand now
that's one piece of information another
tell usually on recreational is that
they're very transparent with their bet
sizing usually meaning that smaller bets
are weak and bigger bets are stronger so
this kept me wondering it's like okay on
one side he's saying that he has a flush
but then the other side the the sizing
doesn't tell me that he has a flush so I
was a little bit in doubt here in terms
of what to do and now people are
watching well what do you mean w you
have seven High you cannot call indeed
we cannot call but we can actually go
for the race now what I like about this
race I thought there was a very fair
chance that uh vill was very Bluff heavy
here with this sizing okay we already
named it Queen 10 910 he also fought
about it for a little while so it could
be that he was just drawing then on his
Spade he was like H maybe I should lead
here and then usually what you will see
if they do have the flush they probably
act a little bit faster and they do tend
to just ship their stacking so with this
read I gave his range way more Bluffs
and if you think about it we're only
risking
$756 to win a pot of1 1891 or at least
that's the total pot the pot
before I made the races 1.1k meaning
that this only has to work somewhere
along 35 to 40% of the time or so so you
know in game I went with my read to my
surprise to my surprise he didn't fold
or call straight away which I kind of
expected he started tanking and I was
like oh my oh my God it's you know it's
just like listen I have $331 behind I
have Ace Queen let's just let's just
chip the final money
after a little bit of debating he did
finally decide to fold let me know what
you guys think uh about this hand okay
is this good poker or am I losing my
mind you tell me in the comments down
below next hand we're opening up Jack 10
of diamonds get a call from the big
blind we see a flop of 475 Tutone and we
start off with a check in general when
the board is low connected these usually
favored the big blind my default
strategy on low boards is going to be
that I'll be range checking now when the
board is like 75 dece rainbow for
example we will definitely be allowed
some betting then kind of what I think
about okay my default is range check but
do I have something better going on with
my hand so let's say 75 Duce and I have
10 Jack might might be a good candidate
to actually throw in a bet or let's say
we have pocket NS it's going to be a low
betting frequency which going to be very
much driven around let's say 75 D eight
N9 10 and then like eight 9 910 these
type of hands so but this board is just
too wet too connect it there's I don't
think any much more that I can do than
range check F now steps half pot now to
be fair this probably where the hand
should be over uh I think Jack 10 let's
say we had 910 with a diamond I think we
can probably continue I think half pot
for jackam with a diamond is a little
bit too expensive um I actually did
decide to call I think raising is also
an option he's going to be stabbing here
50 60% of the time uh I I'd imagine
right these boards they are they are
getting stabbed very aggressively um 910
at least you know has a bit more draws
that it makes on a turn I would not be
peeling Queen 10 or king queen king Jack
Etc but I do have a draw in the future
if you're optimistic poker player like
me you know if an eight rolls off and a
nine rolls off very high chance we get a
stack okay because he will have a
straight and he will not see the Jack T
coming okay so a little bit of uh little
bit of deception here I also I also saw
good things happening like I could lead
on a king and Ace maybe we could even
lead on an eight I don't know if that's
a thing but hey I was I was planning
some funky stuff the 10 is probably the
easiest turn to play unless he now goes
Direction Owen and jems the
river however villain bets three
quarters now this the first interesting
point in the hand from his range
perspective this is a spot where if you
would look up people's strategies you
will see a range of strategies being
used anywhere between half pot three qus
pot overb and usually just as an overall
read for population in spots where
multiple sizes are being used obviously
we don't have a read on this specific
opponent but just general population
Tendencies bigger sizings tend to be
constructed a bit stronger meaning more
value hands and stronger draws and the
smaller sizings tend to be a little bit
more weaker draws Complete Air balls and
lacks like real nutted hand so these
these bets are going to be more designed
for like a seven or pocket eight or some
something along those lines because then
this sizing rules up because they look
too much at their hand and they think
what their hand wants to do instead of
what their range want to do now I'm not
projecting this completely on my
opponents and S reading him now on a
weaker holding but it's definitely
something that I will take in
consideration that a bigger sizing could
have been used so a piece of information
that's definitely on the river going to
help me uh make a better decision all
right now another thing that is
interesting when smaller sizings are
being used by imposition in this spot
and also the fact that the river is a
nine which completes some of his Bluffs
let's say had Jack nine or 89 or like a
random Queen nine king nine I think you
know this is very easy spot for villain
to be out of line on the Flop and out of
line on the turn it's a 10 doesn't
really improve my range well little does
he know I have the Jack 10 something
that then actually will happen in
strategy is that we will actually lead
and I throw out a little a little I was
a bit in doubt sh have about 10% should
about 25% and usually when I'm a doubt
between two sizings guys I end up
somewhere in the middle so that's what I
did decided to go for a little lead this
lead is designed to not have him check
back a seven or a nine okay which I
think is going to have quite a
lot
um so yeah I actually really like this
lead he however was like Hey wo I don't
know what you're doing with this little
lead but uh no Dunkey allowed here I
just RI my stacking so this like a
pretty big race probably like 2.5x the
pot and now it's up to us to range him
and basically the consideration that we
have to make I mean you can look at this
in two ways you can look at it more from
a defensive perspective like okay I have
to defend an X percentage of the time
which hand is good and I just call or we
can look at it a bit more offensive
trying to think okay is my opponent over
bluffing and under bluffing and then
folding or calling range accordingly
okay so there is two things going on
here both from a defensive perspective I
think our hand actually makes for quite
a good bluff catcher we block the Jack
eight which is the hand that I think
he's going to play like this basically
100% of the time we block a hand like
910 that I think he could play like this
100% of the
time obviously we don't block 68 or
something he could have a set very
likely as well so sets some good two
pairs like 910 I don't know if he would
always Jam hand like 54 for example uh
but this is also where the turn sizing
comes in and like I said I'm not going
to make too give too big of a weight on
this read but I thought there was a
chance that if he had 68 or like a good
draw like jack8 that there was a chance
that he might size bigger on the turn so
we have a pretty decent Bluff catcher
what his Bluffs like I said I think just
checking towards him on flop and the
effect that the 10 rolled off on the
turn I think he's very inclined to do a
lot of bluffing even with very unnatural
hands but even the natural hands if we
think about potential candidates ace8
King eight Queen eight if he would Bluff
only a small proportion of those is
probably already going to be massively
over bluffing right then we have the
king six the A6 uh and maybe even like
some Complete Air balls like I guess
complete airb now is going to be hard
maybe like King Jack or something like
that if he's if he's very aggressive so
I figured uh where're our perceiv range
I think is uh is quite capped and weak
right he could have a lot of potential
Bluffs so I think it's very easy for him
to over Bluff uh he has he has the
candidate dates and I think the line
that we took if you're a more action
oriented player you're like hey you're
kept I'm not capped I have all these
nuts that you don't have I'm all in so I
figured his F process could be somewhere
along those lines so I chip in the Jack
10 both because I think it's just a good
hand to call with and both because I
thought it was likely that our opponent
could be over bluffing here and he
showed up with Jack to suited which you
know very out of line but this is
exactly like one of these combinations
that uh that I talked about like we had
like the normal quotequote normal
combinations and then we have just a
bunch of like random stuff like Jack to
suited in there okay so uh yeah I
actually really like the way I played
this hand in this next hand we're
playing a three out of position with Ace
Queen suited versus the button flop
comes King Jack Duce think easy range
bat you have a very big range Advantage
M first button in a three pot on any
board that contains two high cards so
that's what I'll do filling calls send
the turn is I guess the first sort of
interesting point in the hand um I don't
think we're very interested in betting a
lot of like medium strength hand like a
Jack or pocket tense because we beted
range on the Flop he had to do a lot of
folding so just by calling I think uh
the equities are at least
close um so I think what we R out is a
lower frequency with a bigger sizing
weakest hands that we can probably bet
maybe like King n
or something along those lines maybe
some pocket Queens uh but that's about
it Ace Queen particularly in terms of we
talk about Bluffs I actually really like
Ace Queen so I decided to go for a bet
we put a lot of pressure on hands like
threes to T straight away and the good
thing with Ace Queen is that we actually
get called by worse hands if you think
about flush draw or queen 10 suited or
maybe Ace 10 suited these are hands that
he could call with so it's quite mergy
on the turn get better hands to fold get
worse hands to call so I think the turn
bet is uh yeah definitely the best play
V makes the call and the river is
three now obviously we mentioned already
on the turn and this is something that
actually I was already quite focused on
on the turn is the fact that we are
merging a bit on the turn and he's
actually going to call us with quite a
lot of weaker hands so I kind of hooked
myself already on that thought on the
turn I was like w actually if the river
is a blank we might actually have a good
check call now the river is a three so
that means that some of our Bluffs that
we had on the turn would have improved
so let's say we had ace4 suited or ace3
suited we would have now improved that
means that we can Bluff probably a
little bit more so Ace Queen now on a
three I could actually consider bluffing
whereas let's say river is a six I think
we should just always check but I
decided to go for a check and now
villain jams and if we think about it
like what is Vin's value range this
usually the first thing you want to
think about in these kind of situations
because if you start counting and you
cannot really think of a lot of combos
usually it's quite easy to be over
bluffing so I usually like to think
about the value hands first and then
think about the Bluffs so if you think
about his value range what is the bottom
hand that he's jamming maybe something
like King n suited King 10 suited I
don't think he can jam a hand like King
8 suited or even King n suited let's say
I had a hand like King Jack I would
probably always play This Way b b check
call let's say at King Nine I would
probably play This Way myself so I think
his bottom is probably King 10 suited
maybe King n suited so that is six
combos let's say he has some King Jack
King Jack actually could raise turns
some of the time same for king queen so
King Jack is already reduced du the fact
as a king in the Jack and the board king
queen is reduced because we have a queen
in our hand so let's say that gives him
another 16 combos or 20 21 combos he has
some pocket fives with a club so that's
23 maybe has some Deuces 24 let's let's
say ace4 of clubs is a straight right
yeah A4 clubs is a straight so let's say
he has 25 combos we need 31% to be right
so we need roughly 10 Bluff combos then
if we think about the Bluffs Queen 10
obviously is the the auto Bluff right he
has the lower flush STS which are Auto
Bluffs and then he has like some ACE
highs let's say he has Ace 10 is he
going to Bluff those not really sure if
he is going to Bluff I think he will be
probably over
so I kind of thought it was close but
figured it was still worth the call so I
chipped in another 660 bucks and tried
my luck hope he had a mraw but
unfortunately he had king queen let me
know what you guys think about this call
I think the downside of this call is
that if we think about combo wise all
the combos that he could have that he
could Bluff with I think then we might
indeed reach 31% so you could say okay
well he has all these Bluffs so we
should call but I think it's it's a spot
where it's easier for him to under Bluff
than it is to over Bluff because if he
checks behind some AI flush draw for
example on the river he's probably under
bluffing and there's no scenario where
if he Bluffs always Bluffs he's
significantly over bluffing so this
actually something that you have to take
in
consideration um when making hero calls
uh if the best case scenario is that
he's indeed bluffing 31% and that's him
bluffing all his Bluffs probably is not
going to be a profitable call in the
long term and another interesting hand
here with Queen at suited I mean all
hands are going to be interesting that's
why I filtered these hands right so we
overall villain in the small is a
recreational player it's important to
note we see a flop of 968 Vin and checks
and we decide to go out for a little
donkey donkey here if we think about
what drives bad frequencies that's
usually having a certain Advantage now
if you think about like another
advantage that we have here on this
board if we think about 68 suited 69
suited 98 off suit okay these are all
hands that I have in my range that the
under the gun Opa probably doesn't have
in his range the deeper you get not
Advantage also becomes important so how
much nut Advantage do we have both now
and in the future the future aspect here
getting deeper is very important if we
think about Jack 10 off Queen 10 off
these are hands that we're going to have
in this range in our range that probably
doesn't have so I feel like also in the
future we're going to make a lot of
straits like there's going to be a lot
of equity improving cards for us which
are going to is going to put villain 21
here under the gun regular uh in quite a
nasty spot so I figured it would be a
good spot to start investing in the pot
filling calls and the recreation
actually comes along we talk if we want
to talk a little bit about uh how how to
construct this range I think I made a
video before I think I also gave a video
at GTO wizard I think was a free video
you can go check that out there on the
YouTube channel about dunking how to
balance this dunking range honestly it's
not that important in a three-way pot
because let's say I have a very
unbalanced checking range I'm not saying
that I have but let's say my checks are
always weak under the gun still has the
recreational to think of so it's not
like he gets a green light second point
is let's say I check towards him vill
then has to know that I have a dunking
range so therefore my checking range
actually looks different than if I would
check all my hands so that's what he has
to know and then he has to know that if
it's my checking R that's weaker or my
dunk range that's weaker he needs to
then know how I construct that range in
order to play correctly AKA it's going
to be very hard for him to play
correctly to be fair I maybe do not even
exactly know uh how my range looks like
in this spot I have certain horis sixs
that I use to kind of balance things out
but you know you got to allow yourself
to be creative in game and uh I figured
this hand made for for a good donkey for
all the reasons that I just discussed
the turn is where things become
interesting obviously if the turn was a
seven a 10 a jack uh obviously a queen
we make two pair or an eight we make
trips but those were actually initially
the cards that I was looking for because
like I said I think they're very much
improving for my range this guy here he
only check called I think if he had a
nine there was a chance that he could
lead himself right something that
recreational like to do he could maybe
check race versus a small betat and a
call if he had like ace9 king9 so I
think we haven't beat quite a high
percentage of the time if we check here
I think we allow him to play pretty
perfectly we allow two people to realize
our Equity so what I actually decided to
do is I decided to go for an overb and
basically merge my hand now what does it
mean for people who are like okay what
what does it mean to merge your hand I
think what this B is going to accomplish
uh I put a lot of pressure both now and
in the future right we have quite a lot
of money behind and there's going to be
some Equity switching riverse think
about a seven think about a 10 think
about a jack these are very good cards
from my range not for my actual hand but
for my range they're actually quite good
cards and I can apply a lot of pressure
if these cards were off so he the under
gun player is not only concerned about
my range now which like I said I could
easily have a set I could have two pairs
I could have already had the straight
right five seven suited 10 seven suited
in my range which are not in his um so I
think there's a fair chance that if he
has an overpair let's say specifically
jacks or Queens which block a lot of my
Bluffs that he might even already lean
towards folding
okay same if he had a hand like Jack n
suited I think he's probably folding
straight away Queen n suited is probably
folding straight away but if he has a
had like six EXA Hearts 8 seven suited
six seven suited pocket sevens I think
there's actually a good chance that he's
calling or let's say 108 suited same for
the recreational he could even have 87
offsuit he could have 65 offsuit he
could have 67 offsuit so I like this
play I think it keeps it allows me high
EV on certain Rivers which if I check
check they kind of disappear uh yeah
overall just a lot of good things going
on with my hand here recreational calls
the regular uh recreational folds
regular calls river is the heart now I
don't think we really want to be doing
something here with queen and the
Diamonds if we want to be bluffing here
on the river we're probably going to be
using our 10 Jack with a heart or queen
10 with a heart as main Bluffs and I
think Queen H you know we have some
Showdown value but I think we should
just start off with a check and
re-evaluate
villain checks behind and our plan
worked out perfectly because he showed
up six seven of clubs now obviously you
know this is running good in terms of
the majority of the time I think when it
goes check check he's just going to show
me like maybe I had like A9 or 910 or an
over pair and we're just going to lose
but some percentage of the time this is
going to happen I think this boosts a
lot of the EV of the turn bat like I
said on top of the fact that let's say
he does have pocket kings and the river
is a 10 a seven or a queen uh we can
definitely Bluff him off a hand like
that okay so let me know what you guys
thought about this hand and about all
the hands in general uh some of the most
interesting hands that I played if you
