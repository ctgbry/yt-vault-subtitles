and now here we see a standing up and
this is indeed the stand-up game the
other three players have already managed
to win a hand and sit down and it's uh
between me and the person on my left
right now on the flop tree jack seven we
face a bat of 300 euro and basically i
should now just jam the flop and let me
explain you guys why
[Music]
got a little announcement for you guys
because next to our mechanics of poker
program and master classes we have now
released the poker ambition academy in
this academy you will be receiving
weekly interactive webinars based on
your pain points we will be discussing
all areas that you can improve in to
become a more successful poker player
taught by coaches who have walked the
path that you're currently walking so if
you're interested go to the site and
looking forward to seeing you in the
academy
hi there my fellow poker players and
poker playsters if that's even a word
and welcome back to another video here
at the poker ambition channel in which
today we're gonna do something different
we're gonna take our online poker skills
to the live felt as we recently got
invited to play in a live game
and the game has a couple of rules that
maybe are a little bit different to a
traditional game
and i wanted to quickly explain them to
you guys and then we will go into some
of the highlights of the stream as it
was all recorded
if you like this video guys don't forget
to give it a thumbs up subscribe to the
channel as this will probably also be a
two-part series so you will know when
the next series comes out and without
further ado let's get to the rules
for rules the game has three blinds
instead of two or playing five ten
twenty five
in general live games effectively they
will play much bigger i think the game
played
uh more like a 25 50 even a little bit
higher i would say like 35 75 type of
game
the second one is we're playing the
seven deuce game but not only the seven
dudes game but also the a3 game so
this really bumps up the action
basically if you win a hand with seven
deuce or with a3 everyone at the table
has to give you 150 euro okay so that's
quite a lot of blinds
third is there will be some bomb pots
which basically means everyone throws in
100 euro in the middle and we go
straight to the flop so everyone plays
basically 100 range and from there yeah
actually can continue and last but not
least we were sometimes playing a
stand-up game so if you see me stand up
then you kind of know what's going on so
that starts by everyone standing up
cards are being dealt and if you win the
hand you can sit down the stand up game
continues until there's a one person
left standing and if that's you you are
[ __ ] because you have to pay everyone
150 euro now all these extra games will
create some interesting dynamics
especially suddenly your pilots can be
quite good if you have a seven deuce and
atria off and are for example the last
person standing there is basically
almost 1.5 k up for grabs okay so that
definitely incentivizes the action this
is usually why people implement this
type of games and i think it's a great
way to make poker a little bit more fun
so without further ado let's get into
the first hand let's see four race 225
225 to call
so in this first hand we are raising up
six for suited from the button and we
face a very small three bet from the big
blind and i think we have an obvious
call here i don't think a very small
three betting range from the big left
makes a lot of sense as a strategy but
this is actually what this person was
using basically it will allow me to race
call a lot of hands he will have very
little fault equity and let's say you
say okay well now i can re-raise more
hands but actually you're opening the
action again i can come over the top and
put you in a lot of trouble so i think
it's better to use a bit more of a sort
of polarized strategy where your three
bet a little bit bigger and maybe a
little bit less
it's up to players
see it's four bet 225 so 25 to go
so we face a c-bat of around half the
pot we have the six four of diamonds and
there's a five for diamond so basically
there are some straight flush
possibilities in the future usually this
means that i'm not really going anywhere
so that's basically what i do i'm gonna
call and see what happens hope to
improve on turns or that he slows down
and i can steal the pot
so in an interesting spot now he bets
close to the pot and we have a 3k stack
we bought in for the game i think 3.5 k
euro we got called quite last minute and
i had to arrange some cash money managed
to find around 7k so i decided to not
put that on the table at once which was
possible
but
decided to split it into two bullets so
if i would get unlucky early on i would
have a second bullet so i can continue
playing but that now also means that
this big bet is quite a big proportion
of my stack we don't have that much left
if we do decide to call
also a flush draw hit the board which
actually means that
are out let's say the rivers are three
of clubs it might not always be live
uh he could actually
have now paired up with his seven deuce
right this is something that we have to
take in consideration and let's say he
does have eight three like i said he
gets a very good price on his river
bluff so i expect him to continue
bluffing so i just don't think it's a
spot early on that i want to invest 725
euros to see a river i just hoped he
checked and then go from there also i
don't really know this player if i would
have a reed that on the river it tends
to give up i might float a little bit
wider here but i don't think uh
in this case i will do that
take one point so i do indeed decide to
fold
the deuce hit blue
and i do indeed point out that the deuce
now hit with seven dudes he could sell
three eight but obviously he's most
likely to barrel river
his name for the people
want to follow
if i understood that correctly so go
give the guy a follower
next hand again
round two we're opening
nine suited
so johan the organizer of the game also
explained that in last uh last night's
game there was no pot under 1k for the
first hour this is also kind of how the
game was gonna be played okay it was was
quite an aggressive game and money was
definitely flying around to get back to
this hand we see lupu three running the
pocket fives which
big blind first small band it's not
really a hand that i will three bet
but now on the flop definitely a hand
that i would see bet and we have an easy
call
keep on call
but 425
for 25 gold
so we now face a barrel i really like
actually this barrel with pocket fives
with the spade
i could fold possibly a better hand like
pocket sevens pocket eights pocket nines
and i would probably still continue a
hand like a stan with a spade a screen
with a spade type of holdings so i think
his barrow is really good
and i think with king 9 we still have an
easy call i mean he can sometimes be
barreling a hand like he has so i don't
think we are ever folding his hand
we rivered the dream
and now obviously we hope that the
barrel is true
yeah sure
and we have dupia
as we like to say in french and since
the game is dominantly bi french people
duper is one of the only french words
that i know and this came in quite handy
at this moment so we scoop in a nice
little pot unfortunately it didn't
follow through i don't think he should
follow through especially with the a3
missing and that being very dominant in
people's ranges i think in general uh
another reason why i don't think you
should be three betting pocket fives or
three betting a lot in other positions
with funky hands as you will already
have quite a lot of combinations of
seven dudes and eight three in your
range
it's four races 75.
next hand
lupu wacko round number three lupo opens
the button
kingdom suited i decided to call in the
small blind with queen eight suited
there is
no
rake in this game or at least there is
rake but we're playing paying time rake
so basically every hour we pay a certain
rate to the casino which means that
everything that goes in the pot will
remain in the pot which basically allows
you to be a little bit looser again uh i
think this is very good about live games
it again incentivizes the game to play a
little bit looser
okay
sure
we have a
decision there's three spades on the
table and we have a queen and an eight
basically there's two basic principles
here if we have top two pair it's
unlikely that the villain will have
the top pair or the middle pair due to
the blocker effects also when the board
is three spades usually
you want to play your hands a little bit
more carefully so i decided to go for a
check again mainly for these reasons
c3
now it's up to us 125 to call
and
lupu causes on the button he has now
rivered a bottom pair
and
johan jovaro has the a7 he has the spade
draw if it was only johan betting i
might not have just called but i think
when lupu comes in
this is the time to race i think denying
some equity of draws and getting some
value out of draws is probably now a
good idea
um
so yeah that's what i decided to do okay
i make it 600 to go
600 600
63 calls
no one calls with the flush draw
and loop of folds
it's up to players
the river is the jack
now this is definitely not a blank 910
off suit with the 10 of spades or
something could now have made a pair if
he had queen jack he could have now made
two pair
uh there's still a chance obviously that
he has a better hand than me but i do
think batting is still the correct play
usually in these kind of spots when you
decide when you're kind of doubting okay
yeah but i could maybe also check and
then choose a bluff from a flush draw
for example like the one that he has but
in the same time sometimes he will have
a queen that i lose value from i think
betting small is usually the way to go
so let's see if that's what we do
seek one but
i make a little block bet of indeed 500
hoping that i get called by a worse hand
maybe a hand like jack 10 or jack 9 with
a spade that doesn't believe me or that
he maybe throws out a little bluff range
with for example the hand that he has so
i do intend to be bad calling
maybe depending on sizing but
500 i have 2.7 left i don't think i'm
ever going anywhere with this hand
lesson three four does fold and we scoop
in a nice little pot
275 275 to go
and this is actually a very interesting
hand
let's get followed to lupus so lupu back
around number four
and lupu raises it up to 275
euro from the small blind and i'm in the
big blind and this is kind of where the
seven deuce and the a3 game comes into
play
basically he's getting quite a good
price to maybe split this range and with
some part of his range use a bigger race
sizing and include seven dudes off in
there and a3 off so i would say a very
polarized range would make sense you're
very strong hands and a couple of trashy
hands right because your very strong
hands obviously benefit from building a
big pot now and your very shitty hands
benefit from maximum full equity so this
is a very interesting spot never been in
this spot before
so i'm kind of figuring out now what do
i have to do with king 9 well if i think
his range is either very strong or quite
shitty i think king 9 i mean
it kind of depends how crazy you think
your opponent is so far my idea of lupu
this that he was definitely splashing
around and he included the jack eight
off
which
you know i'm not really sure but i i
think this is an okay hand to throw in
there but i just thought he would be a
little bit looser and king nine would
definitely still be a call
you know maybe he would limp pocket aces
some of the time this or like be a bit
more trappy this is actually something
that i've seen in this game as well so i
do end up
calling
with a little bit of a
different range in my hat than if you
would have just raced three acts or four
axes
and let's see the flop
ace ten seven two spades
safe and with
and now it's up to us
325 i mean we have a vector straight
draw back door
nut flush draw so
he can still have and like a tree off in
his range or a random jack eight off or
a random queen eight of
um
seven dudes did make a pair but yeah i
think this is still fine
obviously the ace i am a little bit
concerned he can definitely raise some
ace axe off suit in his big racing range
but i think just calling with the
position go from there is the correct
plate
the turn is the six of spades looper
does a little space check we are very
aware that we have this pick
c4
and we now face a bet of 925
euro now obviously we have gained a gut
shot with our hand we have gained a
flush draw with our hands and i think
there's still a good possibility that we
have the best hand let's say he has a
hand like king queen of king jack off in
game i did thought that if he would
split his range but i can be completely
wrong here but hey we have to make sort
of an estimation in game i thought that
if you would split your range between a
very big and a small race sizing i don't
think king queen of king jack off are
gonna be in the very big race sizing
quite often i think those hands benefit
from a little bit of a smaller race so i
thought his range was still quite
polarized including now very strong aces
or a bluff that was kind of the range
that i put in obviously he could have
made something like a flush he can
definitely still be batting hand like
ace jack but
i think we have an easy corner
see one call
river is the deuce
and lupu thinks about it for a little
while and goes for the check
now i'm in quite an in interesting
scenario i think if he would have just
used a normal race sizing pre and if we
won't play a seven dudes game or a tree
off game i would now just always bet the
river
uh i think checking and losing versus
king queen king jack is not really a
great scenario
but given the range that i gave him with
the big rate sizing and i thought it was
a little bit more polarized i thought it
was more likely that he would now be
checking ahead like ace jack a seven
or he just had nothing and i don't think
an ace is always folding i don't think
even a seven is always folding i mean he
can put me on quite some draws like jack
nine king jack jack queen king queen
there's quite some potential bluffs for
my range so i think this is a spot that
my king nine due to the fact that i
thought he could be very polarized
pre-flop has actually quite a lot of
showdown value
two pair
yeah i was trying to make you think i
had seven to eight three
as you can see he was trying to make me
think that he had seven dudes or a3
obviously a3 he probably doesn't want me
to think i have but seven dudes did was
in indeed two pair so he should have
maybe followed through i think i have
still a lot of hands like this in my
range that i would fault he was quite
upset that he didn't follow through
which i definitely understand uh i think
with the spade and with a straight
blocker i think patting the river there
is definitely the better play
six one raise 75 75
still tilted from the left hand it's
looper versus dueco round number five
i raised the button with jaxy calls with
six nine off from the big blind
no i'm chilled six four but seventy five
you wanted to show the reverse so
because i want to make you think i have
seven two eight three
and i don't follow the i i don't know
why at the end i uh
i don't know why
he doesn't know why he didn't follow
through well if you've seen some of my
last videos
where i explained jared then let's
mental head history
if he goes through that hand and using
that strategy you can figure out why you
didn't do it and maybe not make that
mistake in the future so if this is
something that you would like to learn
go back to one of the previous videos
where i explained that concept and we
face a donk bet of i think 75 and this
is actually i think where i make a
mistake i should now make a very big
raise i think 500 euro is gonna be the
the minimum we're playing
6k
a bit over 5k effective so
i would say that that's definitely the
minimum sizing we should go for
raise however i go for 300 and loop
obviously snap calls i was intending to
over bet this flop if you wouldn't have
checked but i think if people don't bet
they're already shown a little bit of
interest in the pot so i think we can
raise a little bit bigger than if it
would have just over bet i think if he
would have just checked and i overbought
300 euros that would have been fine so i
think this is kind of a small mistake
sizing-wise
three checks we come out firing 150
and we over bet 150
a bit over 1k 1.1 k i'm going for here
as well i think my sizing
um
for the people who see my twitch streams
you know i have like all these help
things and you see the bb i'm not really
aware of my stack size here exactly but
looking at my stack says maybe i would
have liked to see me bet a little bit
bigger in general
there's quite a big compound effect
on the flop already with using the wrong
raise size then on the turn with using a
smaller bed size in terms of how
effective your riverbed is going to be
and how much eevee your riverbed is
going to have so these are small
mistakes that i think compound uh
towards your river ev
but lupu ain't having it
because lupu is gonna go for the race
towards 3k if i'm not mistaking
and now it's up to us
we don't have that much left and not
exactly sure how much we have the
graphics here show that we're playing
3.8 uh he raises to three uh so i also
felt like okay it's gonna be one maybe
2k more at max we have jax
i think this is just the time to uh i
think it's just time to ship it in and
go to bed
ollie
hit one all in i'm all in
lupu doesn't look too happy we don't get
a snap call so we're quite happy about
that
actually we're giving away a little tail
here
as we're leaning back scratching our
belly a little bit and then go back into
position
this is i think a sort of unconscious
stress relief we're playing quite a big
pot you know you never know what this
guy has
obviously i'm happy with my hand but i
think the the release okay he didn't
snap call is something that you just do
unconsciously and i think is actually a
big tell
but
i don't think lupu would have picked up
on that 25
this is one two
five
he does actually lay it down
see it's performed
i didn't trust you
no i trust you
you know what
like that
he didn't trust me but i did show him
the jacks so he made a good fold
six four raised corners next hand we're
raising the queen jack on the button and
again lupo is in there round number six
again going for a small re-race sizing
with the fight for suited again a hand
maybe five for suit that i would
actually still throw in there but
uh
don't go too loose with already having
the eight three and four
it's probably a better strategy he makes
a little race i have an easy call
between jack
keep one pull
flop me to bear
i think especially versus this player so
far just going for a check and letting
him do something funky on a later street
it's probably the correct play
take one coat
brooke is a very bad card an ace
completes a straight completely flush
and obviously makes some of the time but
he bets 500
and now it's up to us
and if you look at the board seven deuce
is a pair a tree is a pair i also think
if he had one of these hands he's way
more likely to bet the flop so i
actually thought his flop check was a
little bit suspicious uh
he bet it quite enthusiastically on both
streets and i actually decided even
though you know we've been playing quite
crazy that this was just a spot that he
was gonna have it quite often
and now here we see us standing up and
this is indeed the stand-up game the
other three players have already managed
to win a hand and sit down
and it's uh between me and the person on
my left rocking the green shirt rocking
the nice white-ish looking pants we
clearly have the same sense of fashion
and this is an interesting spot as let's
say for example i would now fold
then basically he has
a very easy race
and
especially for a bigger sizing because
the rest of the players already sit down
so they're not going to pay any money
anyway where he is very incentivized to
raise big and receive not having to pay
everyone 150 euros so basically if it's
folded to him there is an extra 600 750
in the pot because if hina wins the hand
he receives 150 of me and he doesn't
have to pay 150 of everyone so basically
i want to prevent that from happening so
i would say i would just never fold a
hand and you could maybe say that
limping is an okay strategy i decided to
go for a raising strategy just hoping
that sometimes i would take down the pot
like i said it's mainly the person
that's still standing that has the
decision
and it's now
on my left with ace five student you can
actually see that he's not playing that
dp only has 1.5 k left and i think for
him there's one clear correct play and
that is just to jam uh it might sound a
little bit weird but you have very good
equity being called and like i said
there's an extra 750 euro in the pot so
i think that is literally the only
correct play that he has there with a
hand like h5 let's say he has a seven
two zero eight three then there's even
more money in the pots so then i think
he can definitely just jam because
there's basically 1.5 k in the bottom he
has 1.5 k left with a lot of fault
equity and i'm raising a very big
portion of my range
it's more my back i hope your back will
stand down because it can be longer 275.
he doesn't need 3 but goes for a small
sizing 275 175 one hour but it's so rare
and yes i would go with 10 7 off but i
don't think that is a big mistake as
i also have 75 50 euro extra in the pot
so i'm very much incentivized not to
fall
bossing is a good idea leave him sixty
three hundred
two
three hundred now on the flop tree jack
seven we face a bat of 300 euro and
basically i should now just jam the flop
and let me explain you guys why
basically for the same reason i think he
should have
three bet jammed pre-flop i just have
okay equity been called i have some
fault equity and there's way more money
in the pot than i currently think
basically we're playing sort of a four
by pot type of scenario given the fact
that he only has 1.2 1.3 k left in his
stack
however
unfortunately you did see with the 107
off that i was aware of some extra
dynamics i guess i didn't really process
it correctly in terms of products in
terms of how that would affect my play
especially in terms of aggression and i
actually decided to make the call
actually i think he also makes a mistake
by c betting again because i should
check gem a lot and therefore see
betting the ace of diamonds i think is
mistake you always want to check or just
jam yourself
so mistakes all over the place luckily
poker is not about playing perfect but
making less mistakes with your opponent
and this was definitely a game where i
don't think i played very well but i
think my opponents also didn't play very
well
now the turn is in nine i check
hit one check
and here we can actually see that he
didn't really think it through that much
i called it out but i think he timed for
one and a half minute to two minutes and
then decided to go for a check
you can see i'm a little bit confused of
what's going on rivers at eight we make
a straight
and i think
we should bet very small now
see one but 400 400 and we actually bet
400 which i think is way too big i think
a bet of 200 would have been way better
then we just gave him such an insane
price that basically he should still be
calling quite a lot of hands and
therefore we can value that a little bit
wider but it's just very hard for us to
be bluffing so i think we use the way
too big sizing
uh compared to the bluffs that we can
have here in this spot
we just figured that out unfold
and starts paying us the person who has
to sit down is to show his hand
and he starts to pay everyone 150 euro
which he could have prevented by just
jamming pre-flop
[Music]
lupu going for the call and we are going
for the squeeze with the ace jack off
pick one race
off i actually decide
to
go for a check here
and let me explain you why basically if
i bat and he raises i would have to
fault but i do think he can still have
quite a lot of funky hands in his range
and i think if i check back i keep in
some dominating hands like the hand that
he currently has i think this hand
actually is a good example let's say i
bet he raises i have default whereas if
i just check back i can just call a lot
of turns this is like the power of
position especially versus a more funky
aggressive opponent
during the nice dream scenario for us
and lupu decides to grab chips and
starts wrapping the eggs
and this is exactly what we were looking
for 750 and now it's up to us
what do we do do we call or do we race
and i'm actually counting out the chips
here and i think actually i gave away a
little lifetime here again because i was
consider i wanted to just race and
decide to get value but then i decided
that changed my mind even though i
already had i think like the 20 2500 in
stacked up in front of me at the 2100
and in the
i decided to actually just call and let
him do something crazy on the river
so i don't know if he picked up on that
you can see the stacks
but i'm not gonna throw them in
i just go for a call
take one quote
river is the ace
which is actually not a great card i
think it will not really be incentivized
for lupu to bluff
even though actually i will now have
last ace x and he actually has great
blockers in terms of the jack them so i
think from a theoretical perspective he
has a great hand to be bluffing with but
i do think in practice people will give
up this river quite often
and i now basically already know that
i'm not gonna make much money as it's
very likely for him to just indeed have
nothing so it was a good induce the flop
check but now it's gonna be very hard
for me to pay it off i do go for a very
big bat hoping that he does have
something maybe like eight three you
never know
and i just hope that he puts me on a
misfit flusher on call i don't think
there's much else we can do
but
i'm
and i did show him the ace
his hands a little bit funky we have a
little family pot
everyone limps
and we have the queen nine offsuit in a
small blind
and we flop a little gutter
i think this is not really a board that
you want to be betting for away as we
don't really want to get raised we just
want to check and realize our equity
decides to go out for a little bit which
i think he's going to do with a big part
of his range he got spot i call turn is
the four of spades
and i think this is the moment to take
over the betting lead this is actually
something i would do quite
exploitatively he's been very aggressive
so i think if i have a strong hand i
will just check and let him do his thing
but obviously i have queen high as you
can see he is king nine so i think
exploitatively leading here with my
blood versus an aggressive opponent i
think is a good strategy
so i go from the donkey donkey
and he immediately falls and we scoop in
at night
the next hand we're calling pucker
threes from the big blind versus under
the gun open he opened the seven deuce
and he flops a deuce but unfortunately
for him i flopped a set look at this
it's trouble in paradise for mr clement
i decided to follow mr gavin smith's
advice so when you get dealt a pocket
pair try to flop a set
play it smooth and win all the money i
go for a little check race
another little tail here maybe
immediately looking at a stack i don't
know if i would have done it if i had a
bluff as well so we're picking up a lot
of nice little tails on ourselves
there is a deuce i think this is the
card i'm going to be checking quite
often
and basically i don't have a lot of
strong hands he has the advantage in
terms of seven deuce in terms of over
pairs i think my strongest hand is
probably ace ten
and then pocket threes and pocket deuces
which is very unlikely so i think
continuing by checking is the right play
here
i checked
which is quite a big sizing
and he actually called the checkpoint
really fast on the flop and my image of
him so far is that
he was a little bit on the knittier side
so i actually do think he is going to
have a hand here quite often
but
i do still just decide to call maybe you
could make an argument here for already
raising but you know they're still maybe
has a hand like four or five maybe as
like ace five ace four that he decides
to bluff me with so and those hands have
basically zero percent equity so
well i think just calling is the correct
play
now the river is an ace
and it's up to us
and now you would say okay we check
which i wouldn't
normally always do but like i said
i thought that he was a little bit
nittier
so i don't think he will have a lot of
bluffs when the ace hits and i thought
there was a chance that he would now
always check back his 10 uh check back
maybe had like h4 or h5
uh obviously afraid of a set or ace 10
and i just don't think finland was going
to have a lot of bluffs in his range he
can still have jax queen's kings
so i actually decided to be a little
greedy dutch person and
go all in
with the pocket trees
taking over the betting initiative
obviously if he would think about what
my blocks are in his range yeah he will
not find them
i show the [ __ ] threes and he's very
unlucky with the seven deuce of course
as he has strips
and we have a boat
so play the plate is very funky
or as gavin would say played it very
smoothly
that's very unlucky
very unlucky
we both agreed
another little stand-up action here
you can see there's two persons standing
i race it up with the seven deuce which
and as you can see actually the person
behind me clementi actually folded don't
actually know what he folded but i would
be very wide there as he we are the last
two persons standing up jones in there
with the six eight suited
as you can see actually i decided to
raise a little bit bigger rates
which i thought given the fact that i'm
still standing would make sense to open
a little bit bigger uh generally with my
range i'm not really intended to split
here if i would go back to the drawing
table and come up with a splitting
strategy i think that would be good but
in game you know i didn't really figure
that out
three five ten flop
and i think now we have easy bet
we can basically use any sizing here
i go for a thing
a one third
basically i'm not intending to fall to a
track race so then it doesn't really
matter if you bet a little bit smaller
he falls and we can show the seven deuce
no
and scooping us at 150 euro from
everyone thank you very much
i just show them drunken style and i
think it's good for poker like bring
some fun enjoyment
next end is going to be interesting
we have a little bump but action going
on as you can see there was 400 in the
butt there was no preflop action and
lupu has jacks on the button
and quite a lot of money in front of him
he actually got it in with aces versus
kings or joe on he was the one with
kings but hitted the king he also busted
a couple of the other guys who were at
the table coolering them quite hard so
he was doing great
we have now clement betting out on the
king queen nine flop we're not really
seeing the flop yet but the flop is king
queen nine and he bets out three on it
in the ball of four on and then the bum
but lupu calling and i call as well with
the ace nine suited with backdoors here
we have the hands now
my queen
and the turn is in nine
button lupu has jacks
and i have ace nine i decide to actually
check i think clement coming up betting
seems quite strong for a big sizing as
well so if he continues betting i will
just continue calling but
to be honest i'm not gonna be super
thrilled given how i thought he was
playing and obviously if i check we
check it towards lupu who can have any
10x any jackax as it's a bomb bot and
let them do something funky again i
think is the correct play
clement does decide to check with the
king 10.
and it's indeed up to lupu with the
pocket jacks
dirty on the thought he decides to fire
out
a nice little
bet
of 700. and we're in an interesting spot
now i think if it was just me and lupo
heads up i think i have the easiest call
in the world but actually now we have
clement in there as well we've shown
with 300 euros and 400 on the flop that
he is interested in the pot and probably
has something so that can either be a
good flush draw
or i thought it was very likely that he
indeed had the hand that he had like had
like king 10 and like king jack so i
actually decided that
protecting my hand here was relevant i
think lupu can have just the bear king
any worse nine and i think there's a lot
of hands that i can get value from from
him and i can push clement out with some
equity we can see here that clement has
five percent but that's because lupo has
jacks i obviously didn't know that but i
think king 10 versus maize so has quite
a lot of equity
so i do we need to go for the race
clement six which is again a signal that
he indeed followed the hand that he
didn't want to fold
says something in front that i don't
understand but he's not happy
and now it's up to lupu with the pocket
jacks i raised 2500 so he better 700 so
it's a little bit over three acts and he
is going to make the call with pocket
jacks
i'm quite happy with the scenario and
actually i was just saying in my head
okay deuce on the river please
and the poker gods listen very carefully
and get indeed the deuce on the river
this is like a dream case scenario and
now it is up to us
it shows that we have 6k left but
actually i think this is wrong we will
see afterwards actually i think i have a
little bit more left but now it's
basically up to me i think we have the
best end quite often also taking
consideration some blocker effects of
the fact that clement batted out and
then sikh folded he probably had king 10
king jack i fought in game that was very
likely so it's reduced
that lupu is gonna have a boat or a
street so i think i'm just very happy
with my hand i think i'm just going to
be big and hope to get called by a 9 or
a king or even [ __ ] jacks
so i fire out 4k
and as we can see here in the chips in
front of me i clearly still have
4k left so i think i have more i think i
have like 8k in total
and it's up to loop
right 4 000.
that moment when they ask you how much
you have behind
would i be happy if he jams i'm not
really sure i don't think so
really curious actually what it's almost
impossible for me to say what i would
have done but
i think i would have called
he makes the correct fold
nice sims
clementi's nice head clearly still uh a
little bit frustrated that he couldn't
see a river
for the fool
for the full
i wish i had a full house maybe straight
maybe nine
four hours straight nine oh that's
indeed going to be my range so clement
ranged me quite well there
and here you can see the stats it was
indeed the loophole versus the weka show
with a v-pip of 63
and the wacko with 51 so we're
definitely in here to play like i said
the way the game was structures also
incentivizes you to play a lot with the
time rake with all the games in there
and with the three blinds and the fact
that everyone is a little bit deeper so
a very fun play game to play in i would
say
how have we been doing the wekko has 16k
lupo has 18k so he's still the winner in
the game
and
we will see
what happens in the next video
