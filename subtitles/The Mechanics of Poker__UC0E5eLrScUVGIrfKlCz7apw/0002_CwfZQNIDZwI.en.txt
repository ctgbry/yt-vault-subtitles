[00:00]
raises i do have a decent
blocker here does he ever have 910
no it sounds really relevant so i think
actually i have a
decent blocker here
with d8 back guys

[00:17]
with d8 back guys
to part two of this
500l zoom live play video
if you haven't seen the first part of
the video

[00:31]
the video
then do go and watch that one
and give you guys a little bit of
introduction about me about the brand
about what this where is rev
is coming from means
[Music]

[00:45]
[Music]
i definitely think in part one i went on
quite a ramble
on a couple of topics that had nothing
to do with the hands that were being
played whatsoever
but i think it was interesting stuff so
definitely make sure you check
that out

[01:01]
here we get over bet by a fellow poker
ambition
member always tough to play against
these guys i feel like i have to
probably call this
[Music]

[01:19]
on the ace for jack
go for a small bit interesting board
here with dh5

[01:31]
here with dh5
quite a good board for him as i won't be
treating eights and nines
[Music]
i don't really want to bet and get
raised so
i'm gonna go for a smaller sizing here i

[01:46]
i'm gonna go for a smaller sizing here i
think this is a good spot to go for a
really big overbet
due to the way the rangers are set up we
have a
big advantage here i'm going to check
out with the h5

[02:01]
out with the h5
like i said i didn't really want to bet
and get raced uh
if i check
he checks okay
so we stab the turn

[02:16]
what am i trying to make him fold
i think half pot is a sizing that will
work here's
ace 8. i already thought he was a bit
more on the recreational side

[02:35]
more on the recreational side
but like not uh
not necessarily a fish
and on the river i'm i'm i'm trying to

[02:47]
and on the river i'm i'm i'm trying to
pick a sizing
that's makes sense for a hand that i
would check out with on the flop
i'm trying to look medium like jacks
tents
yeah jack stands maybe maybe like a

[03:01]
yeah jack stands maybe maybe like a
queen could also go for
bigger sizing because it's
i could definitely check all ace queen
for example on the flop and that that
would be a hand that
would definitely that big but i thought
a step check range here would include

[03:19]
a step check range here would include
basically maybe like some hands like a
standard jacking jack that we're just
stabbing once
so i was mainly hoping
he would just fold air

[03:30]
i mean he snapchat with ace eight i mean
if this is his strategy if he's gonna
bet
quite linear on the flop my adjustment
should be to
size big on the river so versus his
strategy probably my river sizing should
be uh
should be annoying i think that works

[03:47]
should be annoying i think that works
probably best
here versus the half part of engage is a
fault
but i think the most important thing
from this hand is
that i don't think c band the flop is

[04:02]
that i don't think c band the flop is
is going to be the way to go i think
this guy is also a recreational player
now let's try the triplet here with
tents

[04:20]
interesting spot i can jam or call
think both r plus a v i prefer
calling in these situations

[04:32]
and waiting for a flop
it kind of depends on how
aggressive your opponent is for bad

[04:47]
aggressive your opponent is for bad
calling
more hands like nines eights he will
start including
obviously the better a fight that
becomes

[05:02]
i'm pretty sure with threes he did that
half part instead of one third
i don't think i'm going to do a lot of
betting here on this turn
when he checks the turn

[05:33]
he bets all in which is quite an
interesting play

[05:50]
i'm gonna check back quite a lot on the
turn trying to think what is a better
hand to call with like a hand maybe like
a screen because basically he's
representing
a king x eraser so i think a screen

[06:01]
a king x eraser so i think a screen
would actually be a better color than uh
than so tense think i'm just gonna fold
tense
and i would call ace queen there so i
think this is also quite important
that when you're bluff catching try to

[06:17]
that when you're bluff catching try to
look at
what your opponent is representing in
this case i think
yeah like i said i think he's rapping
ace king asus
kings maybe a hand maybe like a king x
that he forbaded

[06:31]
that he forbaded
i don't know maybe like king a2 that
king seven suited something like that
against that range my tents really don't
do much only thing actually tens does is
maybe block like some bluffs let's say
yeah they had like queen 10

[06:47]
yeah they had like queen 10
i don't know something like that so i
don't think tens is
a great hand to bluff catch with in this

[07:00]
situation
here with the as5
ship at the flop
don't think having an ace is a great
hand to barrel with

[07:28]
so

[07:38]
near with the 93 basically it was a very
good board for him so i started
checking same with the turn and on the

[07:46]
checking same with the turn and on the
river
i think we have quite an advantage
and i don't think i'm going to be
betting
much less than a good jack
and basically having jack 10 here or
something is already sort of the nuts

[08:01]
something is already sort of the nuts
so i think uh a big sizing there would
make sense from my betting range and i
think 93 is a
it's a good hand to to add as a bluff
but i'm not going to this time check

[08:24]
eight
i don't think the guy is very interested

[08:31]
i don't think the guy is very interested
in the pot
but jack i have some shoulder very
deadline for blind and limp pod

[08:45]
we flopped the unlikely trips here with
deuces
check the turn

[09:09]
check the turn
i think betting small is the way to go
here

[09:20]
the ace is just very good for me
and when we bet one third i think he's
gonna have a lot of trouble defending

[09:36]
gonna have a lot of trouble defending
he's checked suited he's opening quite
small so i will call the big reopens the
more likely m23 by this hand but versus

[09:45]
more likely m23 by this hand but versus
the 2.25 i think calling its best
see if it's half pot again which seems
to be his thing
i think he's jack suited it's quite
close because we're already against ep
i'm gonna go for a call here but

[10:03]
interesting turn it does give me an
advantage here in the
in the hands like five six suited which
i don't think he has
same with deuces and threes so i think

[10:15]
same with deuces and threes so i think
this is a good spot to start
popping it up
think of it as a one by hand like queen

[10:32]
think of it as a one by hand like queen
jack winking
if he's betting that too often i think
we can definitely punish him here
with the check race on the river the
board paris which is
not that favorable for me basically a
hand like

[10:45]
hand like
queen 4 suited 3 4 suited
it's now counterfeited it's less likely
to have deuces
so and also basically his faults
contain quite a lot of
if i would bet the river his faults have

[11:01]
if i would bet the river his faults have
to come from flush draws
so he opened the three four suited okay
then probably i misjudged the advantage
that i would have
i'm getting a barrel here on this turn
which is
quite annoying

[11:17]
i think having a nine here is quite
terrible

[11:30]
because it's most likely barrels are
gonna come from hands like eight nine
ten nine king nine um
so i would way much prefer to call a
hand like queen ten
queen king ace 7
ish or lower i think those will be way

[11:47]
ish or lower i think those will be way
better hands to
continue
kings have a deuce rainbow it's a decent

[12:00]
kings have a deuce rainbow it's a decent
board to see that range on i think queen
jack exactly
it's not necessarily a bad hand to be
checking
i think similar for the turn

[12:33]
don't really mind putting in a small bed

[12:47]
with the hearts batting is
probably better
but both are okay i think uh

[13:03]
basically i love these spots that come
up where you can show aggression or
take a more passive approach i think
you can clearly see the difference in
red liners versus blue liners

[13:17]
red liners versus blue liners
basically what comes down to redliners
strategy focuses more on
equity denial and aggression whenever
possible
and a blue liner strategy focuses a bit

[13:30]
and a blue liner strategy focuses a bit
more on
letting villain realize some equity
and basically losing the pot a bit more
often but
when he wins the pot it's on showdown
and it's usually a bigger pot
in some situations redline play is

[13:46]
in some situations redline play is
better in other situations
and blue line play is better there is
not necessarily a good
or bad in that scenario
but you do see i mean you have players

[14:01]
but you do see i mean you have players
who lose too much redline and you have
players who win too much redline
and then they kind of get the balance
wrong they're they're the redliner is
just
showing aggression and just betting for
the sake of betting too often
whereas the blue liner is missing a lot

[14:16]
whereas the blue liner is missing a lot
of spots
um where he should
apply some aggression and some equity
denial is trying to get the showdown a
bit too often
so

[14:30]
so
like i said i think it's not that
neither one or the other is necessarily
uh better it depends on the situation
and which situation i mean the texture
queen pretty suited

[14:56]
is nine

[15:09]
i think it's a decent hand to bet

[15:15]
he leads
i'm gonna go for a small razor with ace
nine

[15:32]
and check behind on the river
and the reason for that is the reason i
went for a race because i think is
leading range for example let's say yes
and like queen 10
off which is a gutter two overs you know

[15:46]
off which is a gutter two overs you know
they contain quite a lot of equity
so i want to charge those hands
also like a hand that he showed he has
the six
with his paid you can have six eight you
can have worse nines
basically a bunch of hands to get value

[16:00]
basically a bunch of hands to get value
from and our hand needs some protection
could consider valuable in the river but
i thought that would maybe be a bit too
thin

[16:18]
k9 here i don't think this is a board
i'm going gonna be doing a lot of
stabbing how many checks
so i think king nine nine yeah

[16:33]
christmas chips checks again
i think here our hand is a bit too weak

[16:48]
i think here our hand is a bit too weak
to raise don't have a kicker
i think by now this is a good hand to be

[17:01]
i think by now this is a good hand to be
betting with the way they have played
out
having the jack is good
would have already bluffed lower hands
on earlier streets

[17:16]
so i think then what's left is uh his
hand like this if i had king high i
could maybe check
dense i think is it okay and to start
betting here on the flop

[17:33]
betting here on the flop
i think on the turn we have a check
here i think i have an open i'm not
really sure where this guy is

[17:52]
this spot is actually also quite close
i think i'm gonna focus on making a
value bet

[18:09]
i went for quite a small sizing
basically i was looking for a sizing
that i could value but my hand for i

[18:15]
that i could value but my hand for i
think on a turn he's
probably going to have a bit of a polar
approach so he's still going to check
back quite a lot of king x some maybe
even some asex
so i cannot really think having a one
third sizing here would be too big
for my hand i think checking to call is

[18:30]
for my hand i think checking to call is
an option but i don't really like tents
for that so
then kind of what is left

[18:45]
and i bought the river
should i i'm just gonna call i think

[19:05]
seven eight did go a little bit bigger
even a two and a half so
it's close to say the least i would say

[19:28]
we make a straight but it's on the lower

[19:31]
we make a straight but it's on the lower
end
so let's see what happens here blind
first blind i think ace jack high
i'm not sure enough to just check behind
he will go for the barrel i could
consider check raising here

[19:46]
consider check raising here
but there's still
some let's say for example he had 40 40
bb
i could consider jamming now
but there's still quite a lot of bad
rivers to come

[20:05]
now i get back check that here
which
[Music]

[20:17]
i don't think we have a very bad bluff
catcher
eight nine seven eight king
all right
now i do think i'm gonna have to go for

[20:31]
now i do think i'm gonna have to go for
the race
uh
is on the thinner side though you could
say but

[20:45]
jack 8 i think it's for sure race 7 8 i
guess
becomes close but the thing is i didn't
really want to raise the term because
there's still quite a lot of bad rivers
think of a king
and ace jack etc etc a diamond
but that doesn't mean that doesn't mean

[21:02]
but that doesn't mean that doesn't mean
i'm not happy with
my hand that means i'm not i'm only
happy with my hand when the river blanks
out so then when the river blanks out
i think it is important to still try to
get some value
um

[21:22]
and like i said i think the big very big
benefit from the turn track call is that
i i look also quite weak you know i have
quite a lot of

[21:30]
quite a lot of
purpose draws on the turn so it wouldn't
be
it wouldn't be crazy for him to to
target me and start triple barrelling
there
here with seven i'm gonna go for a call

[21:46]
here with seven i'm gonna go for a call
because it's a meme race and there's a
weaker player here on the button
it's a bit different than the king queen
suited scenario earlier
because he opens smaller and we're i'm

[22:00]
because he opens smaller and we're i'm
in a little bit of a later position
so the percentage that i will get
squeezed will go down
if he calls i think i have quite an easy
overcall
it's always a scenario though where you

[22:15]
it's always a scenario though where you
have to be quite careful to not get set
overset
this is ok board read race will make
some top pairs
like ace king wild crazy doesn't really
have queens or kinks so first wild crazy

[22:31]
have queens or kinks so first wild crazy
i think i just have the best hand
here first two week players i think
checking his best we cannot really vote
but
what crazy actually bats out which

[22:45]
what crazy actually bats out which
actually i think is interesting as we
just stated i don't think
he has any sets um
so it's it's it's interesting
interesting to see i don't really know
what he has

[23:01]
what he has
definitely know that this is not a great
card
in the turn we saw someone left behind
so i'm gonna fold the a
jack versus a pop bat it doesn't really
have much money left behind as well so
hmm he bets again

[23:18]
hmm he bets again
starting to feel like a king queen
suited
i think that's the hand that would make
sense
versus that hand i'll call again

[23:33]
i think most likely that he is going to
be
checking and show king queen suited

[23:46]
and i don't think there is much else
that we can do then
check because we're winning against game
queen suited
if he has any different hand i'll be
quite surprised
he did actually have the pocket queens

[24:00]
he did actually have the pocket queens
okay so we
we got away there so minister read was
that he wouldn't have fled at queen's
with me behind
where apparently i was wrong
so we got away cheaply there guys we got
away quite cheaply

[24:16]
away quite cheaply
we got away quite cheaply i think his
best action should be just to check the
flop probably with queens there
here at ace eight i think i'm just gonna
go for a min bat
it's a it's a very hard board for the
opposition to defend against

[24:33]
opposition to defend against
it's like a value slash protection bet
here
but yeah i'm very i'm very lucky that we
got away here

[24:46]
got away here
it's funny how to see that my concerns
came through
let's get suited
i think there's a good hand to go for it
check race

[25:04]
we got a bit of everything going on here
i think checkered sizing should be small

[25:19]
i think the direct straight flush draw
like six eight or eight nine i think are
probably obviously eight nine has my
preference but you know
sometimes you cannot wait for the nuts

[25:32]
sometimes you cannot wait for the nuts
or they're not hand every time
and i think on the turn we have quite an
easy check
didn't improve

[25:50]
figure with jack queen i'm gonna go for
the bet
to quite a good end here on the river

[26:04]
trying to consider sizing here i'm going
to go for an over bed
down in between
i'm gonna go for three quarters he has

[26:15]
i'm gonna go for three quarters he has
quite a lot of jackson queens that are
good calls for his no bet but a flush
also comes in
and i had the queen of clubs so
i think betting smaller there is uh is
probably better
could maybe also still induce a bluff

[26:30]
could maybe also still induce a bluff
race
and here with the six eight basically on
the king he's going to check by quite a
lot of queen's jacks as well
uh so even even if i try to block better
something to wrap ahead like eights or
sixes
i don't think it will get through often

[26:50]
enough
it for suited bit too good to three bet
and oh baby did we flop good

[27:04]
checks
it's not the highest flush in the world
but let's start by betting

[27:15]
he has enough ace x hands to call me
with
so even if even if a club comes it's not
the end of the world
it is actually quite a good club even

[27:32]
since i still have outs
i'll try to do something fancy here

[27:46]
again
i think i'm applying quite a lot of
pressure here to
uh
to his

[28:00]
i'm applying quite a lot of pressure to
his medium flushes
like a 10 high flush and nine high flush
i think actually they probably will fold
some of the time
i do think he can still overhead like
asus
sevens h5 suited a7 suited so he has

[28:15]
sevens h5 suited a7 suited so he has
some two pairs that i think could
continue to the bet
um
and and this is the good thing with
exactly h484 suited that that's why we
did it
eight for suited is like the bluff that

[28:30]
eight for suited is like the bluff that
has
it has like outs to
the nut flush
because we have two clean outs the three
of clubs and the six of clubs

[28:45]
of clubs and the six of clubs
so i thought the play was uh was good
maybe
the problem is like obviously the bigger
you go the more you will fold like jack
high flushes ten high flushes
but in the same time also he might start
folding had like a seven suited h5
suited

[29:00]
suited
pocket deuces or something so that's
kind of the
the debate we have going on here
he had the nut flush we're not gonna
we're not we're not really running good
in uh
in making strong hands and getting uh
getting a lot of money in

[29:16]
getting a lot of money in
interesting choice by the way from him
to slow play this hand i think if you
want to slow play flush you should slow
play
a flush like mine and not really the
nuts i think this is a hand
that if we look ahead will often
be good for three streets so i think

[29:31]
be good for three streets so i think
it's not really a great candidate to
trap with

[29:49]
very very very sorry had a long time to
think about it but did decide to fold in
the end
we get aces which is a strong hand

[30:01]
and we flop
quite good for our range there's
multiple ways we can play this
i think i'm going to go for a small bet
without him between a big bed and a

[30:15]
without him between a big bed and a
small bed
but it's a board where he will have a
lot of the lower pairs
like five six sevens eights and i don't
so it gives me
quite a big advantage

[30:36]
quite a big advantage
is quite a similar story when high cards
come
um he will have more five sixes sevens
eights than i have
so those are boards in general that are

[30:45]
so those are boards in general that are
quite favorable for you to start betting
on
5-9 board that's quite good for the big
blind so i'll start by checking

[31:01]
and probably continue by check raising
he didn't bite
return i'm gonna go for an over bet

[31:25]
kicking it off close
but we'll call for the video sake

[31:32]
but we'll call for the video sake
i think it's a hand that could consider
check raising

[31:47]
check raising
trying to find a good sizing i think
half button is fine
i think it's a hand that would prefer to
keep certain hands in

[32:00]
keep certain hands in
river is quite bad for us obviously we
have a king which makes it less likely
that he has bluffs
can we steal very better hands it's very

[32:15]
can we steal very better hands it's very
very thin uh but i think
i think also i had earlier this was the
case
when the board runs out this good for
you you should just find
a sizing for which you can still value
that your hand and i think this is the

[32:30]
that your hand and i think this is the
correct sizing i
actually i think i should have went even
lower like 10
but i think that would have been a
better play he
raises i do have a decent
blocker here does he ever have 910
no so it sounds really relevant so i

[32:47]
no so it sounds really relevant so i
think actually i have a
decent blocker here
with d8 because i think eight nine is
his
most likely nine

[33:01]
and if you look at 910 he doesn't really
have 910 i think don't think 910 will
ever
i think 910 is like one of the first
hands you would see better on this board
the ninth that he had if he has two
knights he will he will most likely just

[33:16]
knights he will he will most likely just
see that as well
fight nine suited doesn't open uh so i
think the most likely nine that he would
have that he would play like this at a
very high frequency is eight nine
and that's actually a hand that i'm
blocking after i
bet so small like 20 pot i think he has

[33:32]
bet so small like 20 pot i think he has
to raise
more than just a nine or air
so he's probably raising sets he's
raising a four
and actually i still have an advantage
in like the 910

[33:45]
in like the 910
which he doesn't have so i think it's a
good spot to draw the re-race
with exactly the king eight we have a
range advantage and we're blocking
basically his strongest hand that he can
have
so i like it

[34:01]
open aces get flatted by the button
i think this is one of the primary
checking candidates

[34:15]
with the ace diamond the thing is i
don't think he will flat a lot of nine
stance jacks
also not really sure how much 8x suited
e flats
so i think the ev of ac should come from

[34:32]
so i think the ev of ac should come from
check calling and trying to see if we
can get some bluffs
um it's very important to see that like
if the board does
10 64 for example he will have way more
10x so then
i would probably continue by check

[34:45]
i would probably continue by check
raising
but here he has a lack of those hands
when he checks back turn
the idea of nothing where he has maybe
like sixes or sevens i think sixes or

[35:01]
like sixes or sevens i think sixes or
sevens
are quite decent bluff catchers because
they're blocking a straight especially
if they have a diamond with them
so i think i can definitely get some
value in terms of bluster outside
from from our side we can definitely
check all the flop with like some ace

[35:15]
check all the flop with like some ace
kings ace queens
with a diamond finger definitely good
bluffing candidates
raising up there with the ace king
and actually i think we're gonna be
calling it a session

[35:30]
calling it a session
i hope this session has been uh

[35:45]
i hope this session has been uh
educational
um and entertaining at times i hope as
well
i hope it was a joy to watch
and meanwhile we're getting some action
here on our ice king

[36:03]
it's a good spot to go for
it's gonna say over bed
he does have an advantage though in the
tan jack off

[36:16]
tan jack off
so i'm gonna have to be a little bit
careful on the other side though there's
quite a lot of hands that will
uh that will call to a bet like phoenix
or space king as a space
ace jack is 10.

[36:30]
it's interesting there's things to say
for for both sizings here
very big smaller at some point also if
you go that big you're going to make
certain hands fault
which is beneficial as well

[36:45]
maybe not exactly without holding
but as i stated before we're going to be
releasing a bunch
of stuff here on the channel so
make sure to
