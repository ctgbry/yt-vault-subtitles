Yeah, exactly. Well, the solver is

Yeah, exactly. Well, the solver is

Yeah, exactly. Well, the solver is
always correct. You just have to set up

always correct. You just have to set up

always correct. You just have to set up
the solver correctly. So, when people

say GTO, they often mean against a basic
