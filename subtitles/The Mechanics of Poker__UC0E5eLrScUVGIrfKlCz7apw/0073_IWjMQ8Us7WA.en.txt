probably wants it that big
but that's not what we're gonna go for
he jams okay that's good easy call
oh that's a flip and we win
that's that's how we do it guys that's
how we do it god damn it

new promotions so we are diving straight
with our
nose in the action as we say in holland
i don't know if this also translates to
english
normally you know there's a little uh
warm-up tune etc etc but i already
started playing for a little bit
so these first interesting first minutes
are always interesting as i'm just
talking to myself
not like i never do that now the last
the last wicket show was probably our
worst session ever
i remember we didn't win any pots higher
than 40 big blinds and we lost quite a
few
so that's not good but i have to say you
know i played i think two sessions after
that that was kind of
those were sessions where it was kind of
the opposite i never really lost a pot
bigger than 50 bb
especially if you play a little bit
lower volume you have
quite a lot of variants right some
people i see some people posting gradual
sessions where they play 3 000 hands
basically you know for me that can be a
week
so in a week in inward session you know
anything can happen basically
and apparently did so if you look at i
mean some of these sessions one one
twitch session usually i book in what
600 700 hands
so yeah then in total you could say that
i played like 2 000 hands
and then over the 2000 hands i think we
had a quite normal session that started
down quite roughly and then ended up
quite nicely
that's how i would probably describe it
there's the big lines i'm gonna be a
little bit tighter
and i'm just gonna focus on playing
trips
okay versus this recreational
who has been a little bit on a funkier
side so far so that's good
so i think my strategy here is just
gonna be uh let him
be funky and then we're gonna win all
the money
and i think actually i'm gonna continue
that strategy on the river
maybe i'll make a little betty
actually i think i'm gonna check using
this kind of situation i do also like to
make a little bet
and he snapchat so that's the probably
if i would have bet small he would have
called with a hand like that yeah
deuces he would have called the only
downside with recreationals is
when i have a hand as strong as this i
do often see them not
race for example a king whereas if i
would check they would always better
king and then we can track race
so that's kind of the the lemite that
you're in this could actually be
one of the ace heights that's actually
interesting could actually be interested
in betting
but decide not to maybe probably more
like it's
not i think ace eight a seven
with a ace of hearts maybe actually
these are fine candidates for a step
but you know the main thing is obviously
in a checker jacket has some showdown
volume
so your bet has to outperform that and
also you're blocking
hands that are going to check fold
in general that's why it uh but if i
knew we would backdoor did not flush you
know i wouldn't have mind investing a
little bit extra money
and i think on the river we're gonna
we're gonna have quite some like king
jack king queen
with a heart some a size with a heart so
i think a big bad
makes sense yeah trip nights i like the
way he played his hand on all streets
so shout out to mr james big joe mr
burns tries to go
after us with the ajax suited we're in
might mix in a little check raise here
we said we might and we did
again incredibly strong and aggressive
play
[Music]
that's how we roll gavin that's how we
roll we make strong aggressive plays
oh barrel here quite often i'm not
really sure
went for the check me
not really sure about the check
yeah i would have preferred a barrel
actually now he bets
and now we're gonna kind of come in this
scenario so i think i think the
turn is misplayed i should have barreled
but you know now we're here
now we have a call
eastern space wow we touched some
bullets there guys we
touched bullets
touching bullets people were so out of
line
back in the days but like i said they
were
for example floating the flop worked
you know why it worked
very few people are strong enough
to bet it twice after they've been
called
so that's why it worked well we are
going to flop a 10
pocket dancer floppy damn
pocket dance it's exactly what we just
said
we're predicting the [ __ ] future
i would say this is um classified as an
above average flop
well we also called four bet here with
the ace king can we get ace kingo and
pre guys what that [ __ ] let's gamble
baby girl here we go baby girl here we
go okay
come on [ __ ] you hat jax oh my god
king king king king king come on
don't worry guys we didn't get it all in
pre this is actually not much better
this kind of sucks
made a little c bet here what shall we
do what shall we do
so just stack his ass yes we're just
gonna stack his ass
he's very likely as an overpair jacks
queens kings asus i don't want the scare
card to roll off
he actually had a bluff okay respect for
him respect for him
i forget big blind versus cut off
maybe focusing on uh trying to just
stack jack's queen's king's ace is not a
bad idea
while we open up the seven deuce versus
knee to my tree
show them who's boss i just show them
drunken style and
i think it's good for poker like bring
something enjoyment
i'll make a little see that
and three folds fall need to my tree
full
that's our potential it's not very great
on lady streets
it's usually the case that's why seven
loses such a shitty hand
you could make an argument that we're on
never unfolding flow unblocking floats
we do block a seven
actually i don't mind that guy let's
just throw out another another little
small barrel and let's see
let's see what knee 2.3 does pull the
2x3
fold
shout out to me man shout out
to me feel the power
you feel my power baby feel my power
jack nine suited
okay
they would lose a little bit but you
know can't win if you fold guys can't
win if you fault
so let's call one
i do actually like the jack 9 as in i'm
blocking
a hand like king queen for example i
think king queen is a hand that can
quite easily go bombs
same way they have like king 10 suit
especially spades
checks i think on the river i'm going to
make a little a little betty
with a very big proportion of my range
thinking about it ace king
false discipline man that's why he's so
good guys so discipline
so discipline do you want to have a
better understanding of what's going on
in these videos
in our mechanics of poker program we
focus on when and why certain strategy
generates highest ev and how to perform
more consistently at the poker tables
so you can get a deeper understanding of
how poker really works
and how to get more success in poker so
do you want over 30k dollar worth of
value
go over to this site and join our
mechanics of poker program
retrieve at the jacks what i'm gonna do
here what i'm gonna do here
i'm gonna make a little bet
there's not a lot of bad turns for this
particular hand
i think this is the time to just uh
shall we just ship it and go to bed
where is the clip guys ship it i think
it's just time to ship it in and go to
bed
yeah he's thinking feel my power he
calls with nine
seven and we had pocket jacks so he saw
her and he was like ah that's uh that's
uh worst case scenario
it's the worst case scenario free but
hey we'll take it
we'll take it give it to me baby
give me a [ __ ] what the [ __ ] give it
to me baby
okay okay okay we started a big bed here
from knee 2 mark 3.
and we call it's a good turn as
we have a little flush draw action going
on
i know i know it ain't the greatest but
definitely good enough to uh
to see one more card i would say
oh nituma tree continues to tell a story
very few people are strong enough
to bet it twice after they've been
called uh let's hope bernie toomer tree
is one of these people
so we caught
and make a little checky checky on the
river
he is one of these people maybe you're
ever the queen
oh he had nine five suited this guy
is [ __ ] crazy in the head
nine five suited that's a very
uh very incredibly strong and aggressive
play
a strong and aggressive play there if i
need too much i mean way too greedy me
way to greedy these guys
maybe we should give them a little bit
more rope what do you guys think
make a little seabed
and we're going to make a little barrel
with the pocket tents
again it's a spot where i think we're
going to have a very high barring
frequencies
frequency
river is quite interesting i think we
should probably still jam
yeah i think gem is best
and he snap faults so he was drawing
and then had no showdown value so maybe
he had like or at least you know maybe
had like king queen and hearts or
something here we have a3
and we flop oh sorry french people
don't mean this in a bad way i just like
saying
when i have two pair i just like saying
dupe
what you gonna do what you gonna do when
you have two pair
i'm gonna call
big man bets mixes 100k now with some
500 yeah that's uh that's also that's uh
something that is beyond me
easy go again the turn he can still be
value betting worse
in terms of maybe ace queen maybe some
a10 suited
so i think easy call
not sure if he's gonna value bet ace
queen on the river though so that's
gonna be interesting
uh yeah
this is not really a spot that gets
bluffed all that often
jax probably ace suit
could you have ace queen
i'm actually going to make a very neat
default i'm not really feeding this one
i am not really feeding this one
can you can you can start filleting me
in the chat but i'm not feeling that one
kind of kind of got a can can we rewind
can kind of go either way the ace deuce
asus space i would have bet but this one
with the backdoor nuts
don't mind calling
now on the turn actually this hand is a
little bit dubious
but let's see a river i'm gonna have a
lot of hands like
dance for example that's quite shitty
because a lot of his bloods are gonna
come from 10 jack he checks so i now
kind of hope
we win versus stan jack
oh why do people arrange this if you can
just call it
why
oh my god am i the best
admit it said say it you have to say it
how sick is that
how sick is that so i was thinking that
maybe ace deuce would have been a better
call than like pocket tents
okay could be wrong there three but here
with the ace king
that's a good flop gonna have a mix
of bats on this flop and i think this
hand
probably wants it that big but that's
not what we're gonna go for
he jams okay that's good easy call
oh that's a flip and we win
that's that's how we do it guys that's
how we do it god damn it
and here we flop a set we listened
to our good friend mr gavin and we
flopped the set
i'm gonna start making a a bet here
get a call
i'm just gonna check the turn it's maybe
a little bit
dubious
oh oh we're touching bullets guys
we are a dashing bullet how did he not
race the river
what the [ __ ] oh i open up the ace dude
suited a7 suited
there's mr on the boat think he's there
with mr perkins on the boat just
chilling
just chilling
i missed on the boat that's uh three big
blinds
we're gonna call a little bit too much
equity to check race
fish uh don't mind coming over the top
but on the other side also you know we
can make him fold something random but
on the other side we can always call
twice
there's a lot of bot on the other side
so i'm just gonna go
and go for that
you can easily check all twice
what was another tip that we used to get
back in the old days
don't draw on pear boards uh-oh
still gonna do it my friend
because i'm a stubborn guy
he rivered me with 10 3 the [ __ ]
what the [ __ ] idiot players call races
with queen 10 they don't even know how
to spell poker

positive vibes and given to extract
value as a poker player
