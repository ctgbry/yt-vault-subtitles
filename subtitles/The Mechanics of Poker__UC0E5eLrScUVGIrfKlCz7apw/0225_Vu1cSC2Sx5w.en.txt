15L Zoom jumping straight into the
action we three bed here with the pocket
sevens and make a little
seabat the hijack calls I think on the
turn it's a bit close if we want to bet
our hand again I think if we have a club
we probably want to it's very close I'm
going to I'm going to go for a barrel
here I don't mind
it and on a jack we're definitely going
to be ripping it in and this is like one
of the reasons why you want to add a
couple of these lower pair
to your barreling region that for
example when the Jack which is very good
card for me completes I'll have very
little uh Bluffs in my perceived range
because a lot of players they will kind
of miss these type of barrels uh here
with the queen eight my opponent see
it's half pot now snap checks the turn I
think my opponent is a recreational
player um probably just checking the
river again and he gives up which is uh
good news for us but yeah in the turn
your your pocket sevens is probably one
of the lowest pair that we're going to
have in these positions so therefore I
decided and then probably a club is
preferred but you know cannot have
cannot have it all I think a club the
club Nuance might be a bit more
important when you have pocket eights or
for example pocket sevens let's say you
have pocket sixes that's probably then
pure barreling and on the river
obviously it's a must uh must Barrel
King Queen off here we could actually
sometimes for bat now I don't really
know what the Dynamics are in a
50nl uh Zoom po
if people under three bet under F four
bets I would imagine that people have
found the three bet charts but are
probably leaning towards overfall
towards four bets but could definitely
be wrong this is just this is just
intuition if I think about okay it's
easy to find three bets but then it
usually becomes harder to fight back in
this spot I think I'm just going to try
to play solid uh since I have no read on
my opponent so this is where for example
GTO strategies do come in if you are not
really sure if your opponent's under
three betting over three betting
underfolding to four bets over folding
to four bets whatever you should just
then play a defensive strategy where you
know you grab the king queen off and
you're going to do that 25% of the time
or so you're going to roll out maybe a
forb bet and now this should not be
where your approach to strategy ends you
should always try to look for more
information on for example your
population or your opponents to see if
we should either always forbet king
queen off or never forbet king queen off
okay but if we don't have that
information um I think just playing
trying to play solid is okay here over
calling I like the the connectors on the
Lower Side they usually flop quite clean
let's say for example you have 89 off
here much rather fult than 76 off
because 76 off will connect with parts
of their ranges that they will not
connect with think about floing a gutter
for example on 89X compared to a gutter
on 10 Jack a I would much rather have
these lower gutter with the the 67
because it's way more likely that both
my opponents are playing High cards
right it's the old it's old school
knowledge of if they play high cards we
play low cards there is actually some
sort of Truth in that face a big check
race here with Queen N Easy call of
course and hope to improve on the turn
either with a club a queen and
eight that's fine see sizing wise so
this I would imagine so this something
about our hand to
maybe strong enough to just raise stack
it off think I have a weaker draw I
don't mind raising and then just folding
to the gem I think my draw is strong
enough that we can just race call it off
I just think this sizing is going to be
on the weaker side uh so therefore I
used it here I check back with ases face
a bet I'm just going to call and let him
hang
himself definitely raising the river
here I think this is uh I wanted to also
focus a little bit on the differences
between 50nl and for example higher
Stakes so there's one thing for sure
that I think people are just going to
give away way more information with
timing sizing uh and people in general
are going to be less deceptive or this
guy thinks I'm a clown well why why
don't you call me my friend people are
going to be less deceptive so meaning
that a check is is weak and a bet is
strong sort of speak uh and there for
example that small B's probably going to
be very much weighted towards a weaker
hand or at least you know that's just my
general idea that I have now there's
various adjustments we can make in
strategy to take advantage of that the
fact that people give away information
hopefully some spots will come up but
yeah I think they will give away
information they'll be less deceptive
they will probably be I think overfolded
in certain lines and underfolding in
other lines I think underfolding
specifically in terms of being capable
of making big folds probably people will
overestimate their sort of absolute hand
strength a bit too much and I definitely
think um there will be many spots like
the bluffing so if you look at a solver
or if you look at higher Stakes the
bluffing sure there's going to be
bluffing differences right between lines
between certain spots certain spots are
just naturally harder to be under
bluffing or over bluffing I think it's
easy to say that 50 is under bluffing or
the lower Stakes we get which I do think
is true on average the lower Stakes you
get the more people become risk reverse
so they fold more and Bluff less but I
think there's a bigger difference
between certain lines like the lines
that were sensitive to being under
bluffed now get massively under bluffed
and the lines that were sensitive to
getting over bluffed probably still get
overbluff quite a lot but I definitely
think uh if you know how to fult
especially when pots become big and
people say that they have a very strong
hand being able to kind of ddge those
bullets I think definitely is a skill
you should have have at these lower
Stakes it's the skill of avoiding what a
strong striking at what is weak all
right it's a philosophy from The Art of
War great book if you haven't read it
going to go for a faulted a guy opens 3x
I don't know who this guy is but on
average bigger opens are tend to be
stronger if it's a recreational again
here we go with the transparency and not
not being very deceptive big is strong
small is quote quote week this hand
we're going to be in here either by
calling or three betting I'm going to go
for a call this time we do flop some
sort of back or
something think starting with a bat is
okay going to go for half pot here
I think one3 is also completely fine but
it's a board that I don't want to be run
want to really be betting a lot of
medium hands I'm going to bet more like
king queen plus so I'm going to have a
lower betting frequency and then for I
will use a bigger sizing now in multiway
pots you usually don't have to go very
big let's say this was heads up I might
have bet a three qus but multiway half
pot I think then is fine you could also
just bet one 1/3 it's also completely
fine A5 I think we get overb we can
check going to go for an overb here it's
a bit loose but just in general it's a
very good board for me definitely will
continue barreling here I think that is
probably also fine there's going to be a
lot
of the queen is just a very good card
for me let's say has a six Sev eight
nines with a diamond or something you
know he's just in a very tough spot
either now or in the future let's say
king or Jack rolls off he's he's pretty
[ __ ] of course
range wise so I think this is a bit out
of line but fine here uh we isolated the
what I think is recreational player
check called flop check turn I'm going
to check the
turn and see how fast and big he bets on
the river okay snap checks that makes me
feel like he's very much R to high cards
we can either then bet small or overb
I'm going to go for the overb
here and he's not f this is kind of what
we talked about with giving away
information uh the snap check there I
feel like if he has some sort of hand
you know he probably wants to think
about it so I I I say that this Ranger
is very overcard heavy uh and with that
information we can adjust our strategy I
decided then to go for an overb which I
do very Bluff heavy and then if I have a
value hand I would probably size down
just because of the way his range now
looks so this is definitely a a tip for
me when you play lower Stakes pay a lot
of attention really be mainly just
focused on okay what does this guy have
given the information that he gives away
now obviously you know within the pool
I'm sure there's better players and
there's worse players first the better
players you know the opportunities that
you can try to play your solid game plan
but first the majority you want to play
as
exploitatively as possible and really
try to think like okay what does this
mean right what do his actions means
what does this say about his range and
therefore what is the the consequence to
our strategy go for three by a Jack
versus what I think is a recreational
player get a call from the small
blind and a lead I would probably have
not see better it because I feel like
the cold calls either Broadways or lower
pairs so then I think on the turn he is
basically going to tell me what he has
not a small lead I'm not really sure but
you know we get priced in so I'm going
to
call so again we talked about the
information that we give away I think
going for a delayed Cat Here For example
is very good
uh for that reason if you think about
his how his range looks the
turn I'm actually going to fold cold
call small blind lead flop barrel turn
tree High
Broadway I think I think just folding
here is
good also if you think about you
know possible we we could maybe you know
turn a hand to a bluff or something but
again we talked I think there was a PR
that I talked about earlier
like underfolding mainly like absolute
strong hands and big pots like that you
know king queen or something I expect
not to happen often enough so and if I
feel like in a spot like that the fact
that he has a leading range just makes I
think his checking range even weaker and
it doesn't mean that his leading range
per se is weak especially not on a king
10 X type of board here I think I'm just
going to fold straight away the nine is
very bad king queen queen eight
Etc so going to go for three with here
with the
Kings definitely going to call three
there with d89 definitely going to call
the Flop and reevaluate on the turn
probably probably
betting I think a higher a definitely
not betting lower a is definitely
betting lower pairs definitely betting
like Deuces threes this one I'm just not
100% sure do feel like bat check call is
just going to be very nines 10 Jacks
Queens
oriented the Run out's actually pretty
good for me as well in terms of that I
sometimes now improve to pocket five 78
suited if I did float that uh but yeah
if we talk about like people are going
to over fold I think in a spot like that
and that's simply because that turn
check calling range I think is just
going to be again the transparency while
what it looks like he's going to have
nines 10 Jacks Queens maybe has like a
king Jack or a king 10 that he decided
to three betat and he's probably going
to if you look at the GTO solution there
he probably has to Hero call Jacks that
block the king Jack suited some Queens I
would say on average what I would know
of lower stakes and in general like I
said the trend that you see when you go
lower that people in general are more
risk verse and do more folding also we
did block the strongest hands that he
can have like I said I think the if you
have a low a ace4 suited or something or
A7 suited by by by for sure a bet in
theory this six I can
actually dunk B this I think it's good
enough I'm actually going to do
it definitely okay I think to have a
donking range here on this
board and I think now on the turn fors
recreational I think just checking and
seeing what develops is probably best he
bets definitely have to call
one here the king Jack we flop pretty
good we're we're a big deeper if we
weren't deeper I would definitely play
Maybe big bad check here I would
wouldn't have mind that but right now
this easy call nine is very bad improves
it Bluffs 97 107
910 we turn Royal
Flush so I think this could be a spot
where people are going to be overcalling
the turn actually I wouldn't have mind
sizing up as well but I decided to just
follow quote quote
GTO okay now we have to think
about the best line of action I would
say check rise is probably the best line
of action we lose some value from hero
calls but I don't think he's ever going
to raise a queen I definitely think he's
going to bet a
queen we could also induce a bluff from
like Ace Jack with Ace of Hearts we lose
some value from for example Jacks but we
do block that let's say he has a lower
flush let's say it's 5'4 and we just bet
he probably just snap calls but we want
to get all the money so I think it's
important here to go for the check race
just trying to
stack Queen X or better so there's a lot
of hands here in his
range that he's always going to
call and not going to race whereas if we
check he could now bet them and then
call the check race and you know if he
has a cool if he has a boat it's a
cooler
yeah like first this end doesn't really
matter that's unfortunate I hope he
would show up with like let's say a low
flush or
[Music]
something and here inside SE here with
D5 and Barrel to
turn think it's good to have like some
more unnatural Bluffs on like these tree
flush
ports so that if the four flush does
come in we actually have a
Bluff not necessarily that for the
theoretical reasons because in theory
you know we need the bluff to make sure
our value gets caught but I think here
just having a bluff when the four flesh
comes in is just very effective because
you know put put yourself in the other
guy's shoes when was the last time that
you called the turn C bat River came a
four flush and you were like the guy B
and you thought he didn't have a flush
well that's because you know people
usually will have the flush if they bet
the turn the for flush comes in
so therefore I think from an Al
exploitive perspective I think it's good
to to add some of these um these turn
blocks in these
spots here vers four bat I think
A4
probably close I'm going to call but in
this kind of this kind of situations
like I said I'm not really 100% sure
what PO is up to probably in theory this
is A5 is definitely a H4 maybe sometimes
goes for 10% okay so this guy uh this
guy is studied or he has been he has
been watching wo on the YouTube so
definitely calling so far so good now I
think on this turn this is where people
are going to make a
mistake strengthening their betting
range and weakening their checking range
goes through this block bet again I
think it's pretty
good uh not too thrilled about it but
with position getting this price
probably can't fault
yet reevaluate the
river now the Bluffs here should come
from probably his king queen suited I'm
pretty sure they're they're all
Bluffs but uh I would not have called a
betat just don't think this is a spot
that gets bluffed a lot and especially
at lower Stakes I don't think that's the
case River I'm just going to check
behind there's basically no
value uh he played his hand 10 out of 10
in my
opinion so well played by him yeah King
10 actually I don't like some Queen 10
suited should be blov I think the blov
are relatively easy to find in terms of
your queen 10 suited King 10 suited king
queen suited that have don't have clubs
these all make for good candidates the
only problem is that people on a high
boards when everything bricks it's not
really the situation that people
are very happy bluffing because I quite
often have an Ace and like I said I
think these kind of things get uh get
magnified at lower
Stakes could dunk this but this hand is
probably never a dunk in theory and when
I say could dunk this I mean this board
but this is probably not really a thing
I do think when he checks back I'm going
to do something exploitative
and just
bet I think
betting half butt's probably good just
as an overall strategy and I think on
average we should be getting more
fults than Theory I would say
here and we now actually Bing something
uh just going to bet sort of my
hand definitely want to have another
Block in my strategy but I don't think
King 10 is really hand that wants to
block I think your block bet should be
more reserved for the hands that simply
cannot bet for this
sizing and hands that want to come over
the
top so my Approach in a spot like this
in the beginning would be not to play
GTO but to go with my assumption that on
average checks will be weaker and Bets
will be
stronger and then readj and then
basically adjust from there here at the
king I think we can do both uh both
options I think
fine
versus a bat small I'm going to
[Music]
call probably call twice I do think my
king High has some sh on
value first queen eight jack8 Jack 10
stuff like
that and if he does have King 10 that's
a bit
unfortunate but definitely think we can
call again we could maybe DG B some
River
don't think a four is really a river
that I want to
dunk let's draw a little four B here
vers this
guy seems to be IR regular okay now
thinks about quite a long time this
pretty interesting okay that was my one
of my only
concerns let's start with a 10% here so
this is for example something that I
think on a higher Stakes you would not
really see people probably will take
their ace10 to Showdown a bit more often
uh definitely going to be barreling here
on the
turn
and then betting again if the Klo
doesn't
hit I think that's overall good strategy
here I'm going to go
for let see 25 30 going to go for check
racer for recreational a bit on the
bigger side I think this board
it's a bit more sensitive to
inelasticity meaning that you will just
have a lot of king T nine10 Ace 10
suited Queen ax Etc some King Jack some
ACE Jack that probably not really going
to fold if I make 9 or 15 and I think if
I go 15 here there's a lot of turns
let's say the turn is the nine of hearts
or the 10 of hearts or I basically now
created a sto pot ratio where I can just
Jam whereas if you go check race to like
nine probably on an eight or a nine you
know you have to play your hand a little
bit careful so I think not check racing
big on the Flop on a lot of turns will
decrease your EV and you can kind of
increase your EV by looking ahead and
trying to prevent that scenario for
Happening by check raising bigger now
also as soon as we start check raising
bigger he should probably do way more
folding and I think on average a
recreation in that spot will be over
calling his Queen Max his draws here at
a king easy
decision just going to rip it
in and he has Aces we need L A Hearts
dealer give us Hearts that's one heart
but that's not enough
Queen no Iggy can have it GG
Iggy here a call from the small blind
going to check back here with King five
really got want to get check raised and
blow up the pot I will have to call
twice but I think just checking back and
letting him do something stupid it's
probably better thought about it for a
little while then came out with a half
pot easy
call decided to call we're at the pocket
NES we're a bit deeper you know snap
checks back
uh I'm going to read this as a sign of
of weakness and just bet the strength of
my hand
and I think this guy is also so this
guy's either very weak or he's afraid of
the flush if I didn't have a five I
probably lean towards betting smaller
but I think with a five make it less
likely that he has just some random 5x
um so this is a spot where I think he's
usually very weak now we could say okay
then we should not overb our value for
such a huge sizing but I find that when
there's like this this four straight
right with the six and the flush coming
in it's a spot where recreational
players tend to be afraid with let's say
a straight sometimes or a set sometimes
so therefore I
think this hand actually check sometimes
in theory I think but just going to
continue betting so basically because
they're afraid of the flush they will
check way more stronger hands towards us
and therefore I think over betting when
you do have a very strong head like this
is probably still the correct play yes
you know you're losing value from the
weaker side of his range but it's
different let's say the river was a
queen non heart and he checks then I
think it just always is very weak so
then I think that that concept of
adjusting your sizing based on his
strength applies but here because it's a
flush complete and I think he checks
stronger hands towards us more often
because he's quotequote scared but they
still going to call an overb I think an
overb is uh is
better go for the three with at nice
this time we the other time I think we
were like 170 big PLS de person
something here facing a check back again
I'm just going to use my strategy of
doing a lot of probing half
pot
and similar sort of hand strength as
last time I would say so I'm just going
to go again for like a 3/4 sizing and
here going to go for a small bet here on
this Ace King King texture I think
hits me pretty well and probably it's
very close I think if have eight or
sevens should definitely Barrel but I
don't really going to have that a lot
um [ __ ] it TR out the barrel but this
maybe overdoing it a little bit and get
the fult there with the pocket tense
this guy thinks about it for a very long
time and he throws something at my
head I'll give him the fireworks
back hey screen here on this low
board I think I'm want to
check the car the pocket sixes full ver
big bat think also recreational player
this is again what we're talking about
with uh giving away information with
people's timing and sizing on average
you know what you will just see is that
big bats like this you know they're just
going to be way stronger and the smaller
bets are just going to be way weaker
here D Queen easy
call could also raise sometimes I
guess
checks go to bet call let's see if I'm
an idiot
here but I feel like it's a spot where I
said bad call so it means that I'm going
to call the check race cuz I think that
it's a spot where people will have just
a lot of sevenx or pocket eights or
pocket sixes and they' be like oh well
you don't have a four you probably just
have an ace so and he can have a lot of
strong hands so I'm capped he can have a
lot of strong hands in in theory or at
least perceived but I just don't really
see a lot of players
check enough strong hands around the
river because they're just too afraid
I'm going to check back in Ace or you
know can have an overpar or seven or
something like that so if players on
average will overestimate how much
strong hands they have and then then
after they checked and they see the bet
they think I probably just have an Ace
and they could have a lot of
forx but in the meantime they're there
with [ __ ] sixes or five or just a one
PA hand in general and and could over
Bluff for the over Bluff going to go for
an overb here with the queen
Jack sized up a little bit because we're
a bit deeper not sure if
like actually setting up Stacks is a
good idea so maybe maybe just the my
regular would have been fine my regular
on the 25 but uh it's my favorite hand
so obviously not
folding guys remember you need a
favorite hand if I pursuit it come on
make the for
B Ry
calling this
one g go for an overb here with the
54 and forc to probably range check here
on a queen if I think about the hands
that I want to be over betting it's
mainly going to be driven around
Kinks um and
67 so
yeah and the fact that he called made
his range very queenx heavy so I think
we just check F I think it's fine I do
like the overb though I think it's a
good play with my specific
holding but yeah sometimes you just turn
turn bad and definitely go to check race
here this is going to be a board that's
going to be overse but probably quite a
lot and I have decent hand to do it with
um to go back to the the queen Jack I
feel like up
until 200 big blinds deep it's good to
start sizing up but at some point when
you get so deep then I think trying to
get your stack in at some point you know
you're just going to get called by a set
so I think I went a bit too too big
there for for the stack size that we
had here facing a checkback going to
continue my model off thinking that most
players are not going to be protective
enough any snap checks so that probably
confirm something to Checker with the
King 10 and going to call the river he
did size up a bit which is a bit
concerning and he bed very big but you
know we still didn't if he would have
overbed or something would fold it but
yeah here we go A5 for me the BET size
there is going to be the most important
just an average fish unless they go
bigger than pots especially in a line
like this check all small check check
turn B River they just going to be
massively over bluffing and this king
queen hand is a good example of how you
can use the fact that people play
unbalanced ranges and give away
information so for example when I check
here if he's basically going to make a
mistake with the r that way that he
construct his range so let's say he bets
too much Jacka bch too much sets and
then basically leaves his check back
range to be some overs maybe eights NS
maybe the occasional Jack n suited you
know if that's going to be his range uh
then suddenly
we can apply a lot of pressure if you
would see that we would not really get
this information from his range
basically by checking a lot this allows
us to give him the chance to let us know
what he has here I think uh versus this
line check all check he snap check the
river I think his range is very much
weighted towards a five or a seven just
going to make a half po B and expect a
snap fult again the information given
away made this a very easy small bet for
us whereas if he thinks about a little
bit more you know he can have more
strong hands in this range so this
definitely spot where we should be
massively over bluffing and we can get a
snap fold just like with the king queen
and if you know players are giving away
this type of information let's say for
example my hand on a turn could
sometimes barrel all right how does the
fact that they give away this
information influence our strategies
well the EV of check goes up so on the
turn if you have a hand that could
Barrel but if you think on the river
it's going to literally just tell you
what he has either with his sizing or
the way he construct his range or in
this case with timing the EV of check
just massively goes up on the turn now
obviously if you look if you would
consult the solver it shows you the GTO
strategy on the turn which takes in
consideration that the EV of check check
is based on the fact that he's going to
play an optimal probing strategy On The
River an optimal uh phase B check bet
strategy which you know if that's not
the case then basically you get more EV
by getting in the line where the
information is being given away so you
can adjust your strategy
by getting in the line where your
opponent reviews the strength of his
hand more often that's then where the EV
EV gain is taken place and we could even
take this concept even further if we
know he has the tendency to tell you
what he has either with the sizing or du
to his timing if run on the button you
have King six offsuit by all means go
and open because the future street that
you're going to play you will have
increased EV because you will have more
information and therefore can make
better decisions it's what I like to
call the ripple effect so a future leak
in your opponent's strategy will have
direct consequences to the EV of hands
that you play on earlier streets
including pre flop so the more
information your opponent gives away or
in general the more leaks that they have
even on later
streets the more hands we can play
either pre- flop or on the Flop get to
those streets where these leaks
occur go for a big betat here with the
King n this time not going too big
because we just had a little ramble
about if we surpass the 200 Big B deep
line uh deep Mark he goes for a check
Min no this is not a check MIM race just
going to call and see what develops
thinks about it so the longer thinks
about it the more I think y has a very
strong hand
basically I'm going to eliminate the the
medium part from his range so if you
would have checked I would have
definitely checked behind because I
think I'm actually sometimes winning
forsus Jack a jack n or he has like a
set or straight or something you know
that he's trying to trying to fast play
I'm just going to fold the turn I don't
think our hand has a lot of imply dots
when we hit our flush our flush I don't
think is always good as well if the
board pars for example so we have
reduced outs there is a very small
chance that he has the N flush draw
which obviously wouldn't be great as
well but I think if he would have
checked after that timing I think it's a
a mistake to to bet cuz if if he if he
checks you're trying to get trying to
you're trying to put a 10 or something
in a tou spot but I don't think it takes
this long with a 10 so basically the
longer he waits on the turn the more I
think his check race frequency goes up
and his check fault frequency goes up
but his check call frequency definitely
goes down but you know he did check
raise and overb so if think in general
it's mainly going to be the check race
that that goes up here is Jack probably
going to lean towards a check race he
did go half pot though which is a little
bit concerned
concerning um
[Music]
okay this half pot is throwing me off a
little bit normally I would check
race but I'm I'm just going to make a n
default let's let's continue on the
general team right
that bigger bets are going to be
stronger but normally my play with there
would be to check race I think here see
big on this
board I picked up a straight draw which
is a bit unfortunate I wish I
didn't people are going to be so
massively on the bluffing here but I
guess guess calling one is a
still a little sort of mandatory here
with the nine you know you could have
King 10 Queen 10 I think if I had the 10
I would much rather prefer folding yeah
he had the queen 10 he gave the river so
that's I guess the only benefit but this
is kind of the problem right this is if
this is like the best best case scenario
for us okay that he
has
um that he has an open
Ender and and other or he has hands that
has us beat you know we should probably
just be uh be folding the turn here we
decide to overb with the King n on the
Flop a lot of overb boards are are
coming along it's not like I I I I don't
do this uh just for the sake of the
video it's just my strategy on all the
textures that
arrived go to check here on the
turn snap checks the river now this is
again a bit concerning uh this is this
is concerning in terms of the fact that
we have very strong which eliminates I
think the strong hands that he has in
his range I'm just going to go medium
but he probably has a
Jack or like a weak
Queen normally I would overb here but
with with the timing I think he's just
going to fold um so yeah the A9
interesting let me know comments down
below what you guys think I think
folding is actually probably just just
okay because like I said King 10 Queen
10 these are all open Enders
People BET too much is King is Queen B
yeah I think actually this terrible
call uh terrible call I think from me on
the turn I mean terrible is maybe a
little bit too too big of a word but
it's definitely a losing call I think
you know people probably don't don't
have enough of d89 D810 maybe Jack n
Jack 10 definitely definitely going to
be in there as well at least in theory
so again if you would then look at the
solver it's A9 a CO I can already tell
you that in GTO A9 is never ever
folding I can tell you that that much
why ace9 is never folding and that's due
to the range at imposition bets versus
the GTO range I would call but versus
the range of shoot a bunny probably
not when check flop check turn Ace King
definitely calling Ace Queen
go to lead the river
here some funky stuff going on and I'm
going to fall to a race
probably not really sure about my sizing
could have maybe sized a little bit
bigger yeah the reason the reason why I
lead the river is is I don't want him to
just check back a nine a 10 pocket eight
uh pocket sixes stuff like that so
basically uh by betting this small kind
of forcing
him uh to call me with some of those
hands King Jack did come did get there
uh but he also has king queen queen Jack
I think my hand's worth a little bit
more money than then the size that I bet
at probably half pot would have been
okay as well and like I was also maybe a
little bit concerned that he might check
back Queen Jack king queen so basically
I'm just leading the river because I'm
concerned that he's going to check back
some heads that could potentially call a
bet this one's pretty interesting on the
turn if he
checks just think about it for quite a
while uh I would I would again make
quite some big fault here on the
turn uh and if he checks I would apply
quite some pressure
again under the model of people probably
show a little deception and just bet too
much of their strong hands and check too
much of their weak hands the way we can
adjust to that is by Val betting thinner
using bigger sizings and adding more
Bluffs to the betting range that's it
for today's session guys I hope you
learned something in this video about
how to maneuver in these type of pools
and how to capitalize on the numerous
mistakes that we saw our opponents
making if it did help you in anyway then
I would wish you guys to help me leave a
