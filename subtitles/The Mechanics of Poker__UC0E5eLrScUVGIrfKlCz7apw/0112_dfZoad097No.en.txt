[00:00]
looks like he's gonna check
he's not oh thank you very much sir
wow
[Music]
got a little announcement for you guys
because next to our mechanics of poker

[00:16]
because next to our mechanics of poker
program and master classes we have now
released the poker ambition academy in
this academy you will be receiving
weekly interactive webinars based on
your pain points we will be discussing
all areas that you can improve in to

[00:30]
all areas that you can improve in to
become a more successful poker player
taught by coaches who have walked the
path that you are currently walking so
if you're interested go to the site and
i'm looking forward to seeing you in
that kenny
if it worked it was a good play all
right that's the policy here on stream

[00:49]
we also like the flop flushes
um
you don't have questions

[01:01]
you don't have questions
you probably have some questions about
the deviations
well i'm just curious like did having
the ace of diamonds have a big impact as
to why you live there yeah the ace in
the deuce basically both cards i thought
were are farther just very good cards to
have
yeah and they had and it has like a

[01:16]
yeah and they had and it has like a
little bit of uh
mergy effects
true
yeah that hand kind of just doesn't do
well check calling or
check raising does it
so basically you unblock all the you

[01:31]
so basically you unblock all the you
block all the floats like
like if you check he will take over the
initiative with like three nine at the
clubs it's a hand that we beat but we're
never gonna realize against that i think
if we over at the turn he's still going
to call you with king high flush draws
and we can often win on the river

[01:46]
and we can often win on the river
like let's say for example the river
periscope board
right
i think we have quite an uh
quite a good chance of showing down some
of the time or versus different ace
highs that we chop the river

[02:01]
yeah it's interesting
i'm sure i'll have plenty of fun
questions for you today

[02:29]
it's interesting you're taking a

[02:30]
it's interesting you're taking a
deviation against uh
a regular early on
uh you know
like i said new player man new player if
i if i feel if
like depending on when i'm streaming i

[02:45]
like depending on when i'm streaming i
can either play very aggressively or
very passively and that's kind of like
using usually in the beginning of the
stream we set the toe for the rest of
the stream
okay i i like that i can i can
appreciate that so shall we also just
for for that argument's take four by
this hand

[03:01]
we just continue
okay so let's see how that goes
we roll the high number
of an okay candidate
okay there you go i mean everything's
working for you so everything is working
get a four bet okay this is revenge

[03:18]
get a four bet okay this is revenge
i think i'm just gonna call
wouldn't mind fight by bluffing when
we're on the bbd but i think
continue by calling flopping sets

[03:30]
usually how we roll
you know maybe i uh you know some of my
luck might be
i mean i told you right bring bring the
cj good luck to the stream have you seen
it you are already welcome if you broke

[03:47]
no i haven't seen your av graph is it
bad
what's that
i haven't seen your ev graph is it bad
uh it's not bad but i'm running even
better than my ev

[04:00]
better than my ev
this turn is quite
i'm gonna go for the jack again
would have check raised this flop which
i would have if you would have seen that
which i would have done
quite a lot

[04:15]
quite a lot
texas would have definitely been
included
now i check because i think basically a
lot of the hands that i would get two
streets of value from are probably gonna
bat
uh themselves if i start checking like
now

[04:32]
i think on a four
that doesn't really change much
especially if he has a spade to go with
his hand
and also with the sixes you know we
still have to dodge
uh an ace and a seven so i don't mind

[04:45]
uh an ace and a seven so i don't mind
playing it slow
playing it's mood winning on the money
that's what gavin always says when you
have a set but that's what we're trying
to do we're trying to follow gavin's
advice
you never know maybe he draws a little
fluffy bluffy

[05:03]
he checked back the flop right yeah he
checked back up
but it looks like he's considering pot
controlling or not that's i think his
decision right now

[05:15]
looks like he's gonna check
he's not oh thank you very much sir
wow
that's weird it's the wacko factor they
think i'm a little bit crazy i hero call

[05:30]
think i'm a little bit crazy i hero call
uh
i recall a bit too much
hey um yeah i play
well right now i'm playing 500 zoom
and um
i'm trying to make my way up to the
wacko stakes

[05:45]
wacko stakes
so
good good place to be for me right now i
guess um
yeah i play mostly 500 zoom right now
and uh i take shots at one knl when
i can get a seat
um
previously though i've played high

[06:00]
previously though i've played high
stakes mixed games
for a long time
i was gonna say i i remember a joe
ingram podcast
long time ago where you were playing
mixed games right
yeah i was i was i was playing actually
the highest games you could play online

[06:15]
the highest games you could play online
for a little while that was that was uh
fun and uh exciting until you know you
run like
you run like awful i think smoker is
very nice until you start running three
possible games and then they break

[06:30]
possible games and then they break
and you can't play anymore
i
yeah i was chasing a whale as they say
you know uh
finding trying to hunt my moby dick and
then uh ended up
alone and uh

[06:46]
alone and uh
afraid in the middle of the ocean
this end's quite interesting i was
considering bluffing river i think on
the turn
when the deuce connects
like i do think we're blocking some of
his check backs but i think in practice

[07:00]
his check backs but i think in practice
people bat queen jack king queen a
little bit more
i once i once rated to uh to a hot tub
girl because there was no one online
and
so we raped and she said thank you for
the raid so i wanted to say something in
chat but then it said like

[07:15]
chat but then it said like
you have to be subscriber for at least
five minutes in order to chat
to my surprise
all right a very big part of my
following
could instantly chat
that's quite interesting right culture

[07:30]
that's quite interesting right culture
was obviously the first one to throw out
some chats
i'm sure i'm sure they already met with
our little seven dudes guys
raise and take for the second i just
show them drunken style and i think it's
good for poker like bring some fun
enjoyment i'm pretty sure actually
nowadays i'm profiting again with seven

[07:45]
nowadays i'm profiting again with seven
dudes frequencies freaking should call
frequency full worries
not showing up
okay
i'm all over maybe it never happened
huh
maybe it never happened it just never
happened

[08:01]
what was the position
chat just wants to see our dogs they
don't even want to see us
i want to see my dog actually my dog is

[08:17]
i want to see my dog actually my dog is
here
what do we do bella what do we do
i throw in i throw in the flack and i
play the chicken sound
chicken song

[08:30]
chicken song
where's the chicken song yes chicken
some defense people have been asking for
the chickens
[Music]
hey you like the chicken song i love the
chicken song

[08:46]
it was actually funny the other day i
was
i was looking through youtube randomly
and the chicken song came up really
and until then
i believed that it was actually your

[09:00]
i believed that it was actually your
song
so when it came out i was like oh it's
the wacko's chicken song
no it's just if you go to youtube when
you say chicken song you will find it
yeah i i learned i learned that i wasn't
uh
very aware of the internet at that point

[09:15]
very aware of the internet at that point
pay attention guys we are giving away
over 10k dollar worth of free prizes in

[09:30]
so what are you waiting for join our
weekly interactive webinars at the poker
ambition academy we open a little chest
in the meanwhile oh yeah about 500 and
above i was kidding
[Music]
it's oh this is this is
what did we win can i still see it

[09:47]
what did we win can i still see it
20 bucks
got it don't buy into one game with that
no wsop for cg no i am

[10:02]
no wsop for cg no i am
i i'm taking this one off due to uh some
health concerns at the world series of
poker this year
you mean covet
yes

[10:15]
okay just checking
yeah i just i feel like i
from watching afar
it seems uh
i don't know not as fun as it would be
if uh covet wasn't happening you know

[10:35]
yeah no i i i cannot
have have you uh have you frequented the
world series of poker i went twice
like very early on in my career probably

[10:45]
like very early on in my career probably
like eight years ago or something twice
in a row
okay
and then never returned
no after that i
i think one of what actually let me see
what he called with i imagine something
like tents

[11:00]
like tents
you check back pocket aces
look at him look at him being trappy
how did that play can you hit the replay
button
you checked the flop that is a strong
and not aggressive place

[11:17]
and not aggressive place
it's a little thick
it's gonna be the hand
probably i would say always calling
twice
so
go from there unless the turn is a

[11:30]
go from there unless the turn is a
good question
actually i was gonna think like nine of
spades or something you know like a very
good completing car and gave him some
extra potential and then actually nice
place but i don't think we are letting
this go just yet
especially not for size

[11:46]
to be honest

[12:02]
and i was going to say to be honest i
don't mind a race here
see what happened

[12:17]
so
well we had equity versus that we had
equity first
yeah
what do you think of the turn race

[12:32]
what do you think of the turn race
um
it's not something i would choose to but
i can respect it
yeah like because like a lot of his
bluffs are gonna contain life cards
right somewhere

[12:45]
right somewhere
in this region and i think a lot of his
blocking range
that's
gonna be a bit like these hands right so
worst case this is like
i think often this is worst case
scenario
i i think i i would just prefer maybe to

[13:00]
i i think i i would just prefer maybe to
have hearts to do that
but hearts is like his main barrel right
let's say he has king eight the thinking
eight that he's gonna barrel with his
heart
like you don't wanna have spades

[13:15]
like you don't wanna have spades
i would say clubs or diamonds are fine
both fine cannon
you understand what i mean okay
yeah i just don't know if this spot is
actually like a raise with king queen
i do think we're gonna play some races

[13:32]
i do think we're gonna play some races
probably probably
what would you rather race king queen
or
5 4 suited
that's a trick question

[13:47]
um
yeah
there's only three questions on the weka
show
any difficulty
i'm not aware of it yet so i i'd be
learning something
all right let's uh let's look at that

[14:00]
all right let's uh let's look at that
hand there
okay
i don't have i don't know
i love these things you know
they just come on the fly
yeah i i i think that

[14:15]
yeah i i i think that
if i had to guess
i would choose something like
the
i would choose something like the hearts
combo but
if you say that's wrong then yeah it
could be wrong
why would you prefer the hearts combo

[14:32]
why would you prefer the hearts combo
uh it blocks
the important asex they can bet call
with
but that might be
i guess like what what ace x
would it be maybe like some frequency of

[14:46]
would it be maybe like some frequency of
a6 suited a7 suited
i i generally polarize more on the turn
that's that's the problem here is that i
think that king queen is merging a bit
too much for raising

[15:00]
too much for raising
even versus one third
like
it for me i would probably choose
something like
uh that has i don't know has more equity
less showdown value

[15:16]
less showdown value
so you you would call
um because what would what would we do
with
you know do you play
like that's that
oh jen
do you play gems

[15:31]
do you play gems
i do
um
yeah i mean this is i think you jam
jacks more than queens no yeah for sure
small blind versus big blinds

[15:46]
small blind versus big blinds
queen's cookies there's never a big one
but i thought that 93
yeah that hand honestly i i don't know i
don't know the answer on the turn what
hands i would be turning into a bluff
but i feel like intuitively that would

[16:01]
but i feel like intuitively that would
be more polarized than
when when you have certain spots i tend
to go to the fundamental
equilibrium
whereas you're already thinking about
how can i deviate from the equilibrium
no yeah that makes a lot of sense yeah

[16:16]
no yeah that makes a lot of sense yeah
indeed my mind probably goes a bit
faster in terms of this is probably
what's supposed to happen this is the
equilibrium but this is what really
happens this is probably the exploit
right yeah i know i understand what you
mean
so i find that which comes with the

[16:30]
so i find that which comes with the
experience right
there's which which which actually is
good and and bad in my experience
because it's good because obviously
you're you're knowing how to exploit
players and you're you're taking the
exploits but it's bad sometimes because
you can easily over assume and deviate

[16:48]
you can easily over assume and deviate
yeah for sure i would say that's
definitely a thing
that i and i've i don't want to say
struggle with but
yeah probably i find that it's a it's a
problem of knowing too much information

[17:03]
for you you know too much
but i see it i see it in the really good
regs all the time where it seems like
they take spots against me because they
assume i'm not

[17:16]
balanced that makes that makes sense
actually we have two things about two
barrel spots i stepped half part here
barreled i stepped three quarters here
barrelled we made it straight but it's
not a very high one
i hope he doesn't dunk if he dunks

[17:32]
i hope he doesn't dunk if he dunks
though i will probably call
no he doesn't dunk
should have done man should have dunked
