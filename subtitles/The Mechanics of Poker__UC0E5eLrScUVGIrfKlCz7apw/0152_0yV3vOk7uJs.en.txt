really complex game

[22:33]
really complex game
every unit that you have has different

[22:35]
every unit that you have has different

[22:35]
every unit that you have has different
power and different weapon and for

[22:38]
power and different weapon and for

[22:38]
power and different weapon and for
example to touch your opponent you use a

[22:40]
example to touch your opponent you use a

[22:40]
example to touch your opponent you use a
meter like for example this unit can

[22:43]
meter like for example this unit can

[22:43]
meter like for example this unit can
shoot

[22:44]
shoot

[22:44]
shoot
up to like let's say 30 centimeter

[22:47]
up to like let's say 30 centimeter

[22:47]
up to like let's say 30 centimeter
so if you know your unit is 30

[22:50]
so if you know your unit is 30

[22:50]
so if you know your unit is 30
centimeter away from opponent unit then

[22:52]
centimeter away from opponent unit then

[22:52]
centimeter away from opponent unit then
you can shot them then you use dice so

[22:54]
you can shot them then you use dice so

[22:54]
you can shot them then you use dice so
there is a bit of variance because for

[22:57]
there is a bit of variance because for

[22:57]
there is a bit of variance because for
example

[22:58]
example

[22:58]
example
one unit has maybe six uh solder

[23:01]
one unit has maybe six uh solder

[23:01]
one unit has maybe six uh solder
so you use six dices

[23:04]
so you use six dices

[23:04]
so you use six dices
and

[23:05]
and

[23:05]
and
they have like precision let's say like

[23:08]
they have like precision let's say like

[23:08]
they have like precision let's say like
uh

[23:08]
uh

[23:08]
uh
for

[23:09]
for

[23:09]
for
like 50 percent then it's if it's four

[23:12]
like 50 percent then it's if it's four

[23:12]
like 50 percent then it's if it's four
five or six then you eat the the the the

[23:17]
five or six then you eat the the the the

[23:17]
five or six then you eat the the the the
opponent you understand if it's like one

[23:19]
opponent you understand if it's like one

[23:19]
opponent you understand if it's like one
two or three then you you missed

[23:21]
two or three then you you missed

[23:21]
two or three then you you missed
so

[23:22]
so

[23:22]
so
um every unit some units have like 80

[23:25]
um every unit some units have like 80

[23:25]
um every unit some units have like 80
precision you know and and and and then

precision you know and and and and then
there is damage and everything damages

there is damage and everything damages
everything so it's like really complex

everything so it's like really complex

[23:31]
everything so it's like really complex
but it's really interesting it's uh it's
