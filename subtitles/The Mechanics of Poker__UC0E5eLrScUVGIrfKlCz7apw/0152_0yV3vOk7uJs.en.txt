today's episode
hi there my fellow ambitious poker
players and welcome back to another
episode of the mechanics of poker
podcast episode 9
and in today's episode our guest lives a
life that i'm sure many of you might
envy he travels around the world while
staying at the nicest places eating at
the nicest places he gambles for a lot
of money he loves to party and he's
often accompanied by beautiful women no
we're not talking about dan balzarian
would be great to have him on the future
but for now no but we're talking about
the french poker superstar johann joe
viral gilbert
i hope i pronounced that correctly
especially over the last year he has
gained worldwide popularity when making
his appearance in the high roller scene
in which he managed to cash over 1.5
million dollars so far
however he has more experience playing
cash games in which he plays up to 500
1k so that is like a 500 is a small
blind 1000 is the big blind so that
makes it what
100k knl or something those are insane
stakes those are some serious takes and
as always that didn't happen over time
guys it took him over 10 years to reach
this stakes i personally met him around
six years ago while he was actually
trying to hit my wife in the jacuzzi of
my local gym
luckily he was not that convincing and i
managed to celebrate my nine year
anniversary yesterday
i'm very curious to hear
because over these last six years
especially made a lot of progress and
i'm very curious to hear his story
uh did you know johan before adam
i've heard of him recently in the high
stakes circles and i know he's got a
very popular youtube channel and his
instagram's really big as well but i
don't know too much about his story so
yeah i'm really curious to hear his
background i know he was a bit of a
gamer growing up and a lot of success in
different games so i'm really curious to
know how he's managed to blow up
especially the last few years i'm
curious to know what changed the last
one or two years for him to really go
viral with his kind of content but also
playing the higher stakes games and a
lot of success there so yeah really
looking forward to bringing out his
story and his journey to where he is now
yeah i share a similar curiosity so
without further ado let's have you go on
on
all right there he is johan's life from
both room in turkey
yo
i'm good i'm good thanks on vacation
last day before going to
to monaco monte carlo for european poker
tour
10 days of grind from tomorrow yeah
i decided to go to boardroom in turkey i
never been there it's it's a bit the
monaco let's say the monte carlo of
turkey
has never been
it's like very nice views it's really
similar to
monte carlo views with like
like some some mountain not very high
but like uh the sea and some mountain
behind and
and it's a bit like between santorini
and monaco
uh but in turkey
the beautiful uh
spots
you you do this quite often because you
travel around do you often take like a
little notification before you should be
grind like the ept or something yeah i
should do more actually i don't do that
often i i should
i will do more and more of that because
i think it's good balance
for
because those those grind like
especially when you play irons and stuff
it's like quite intense
because like uh
of course you can swing a large amount
in in usd so
so i think uh having a
balance with some real vacation without
uh
playing at all
it's uh it's uh and doing completely
other stuff then
then what you do when you are like on
the poker circuit like
uh
like a proper hotel and and and beach or
stuff that that i'm i'm not
willing to do often because maybe i get
too bored by those things but i think
sometimes to force myself to have a rest
like it's the case now it's it's not a
bad thing
i think it's also good to clear your
mind right i think we all know that if
you spend a lot of time in poker
sometimes you want to progress more and
more information is not it's not
necessarily the solution right you need
to just take a step back and let that
information process to create sort of
some space for new information again
feel motivated again probably you're
excited now to play poker again after
doing nothing
after doing nothing exactly after doing
two weeks of uh
i have traveled in bucharest belgrade
and
boardroom so i've traveled two weeks for
pure parties or vacation
so definitely not playing poker since
two weeks since uh cyprus uh
high rollers so yeah i'm i'm hyped up
again like it's poker is always like
that i can play 12 i played
it's been 12 years i play poker
for 13 years 13 years i play poker uh 12
years professionally and it has always
been the same in
in a certain way that i love the game
every time i love the game i can play it
like straight eight months ago like i
did recently eight months straight
without breaks
uh but
there is a uh
there is a point where you enjoy less
the grind when you do that too much and
when you when you put in between some
vacations some sometimes off for
yourself then then the grind uh becomes
again super um
enjoyable because you you really
uh i don't know you really miss poke and
then you want to to go back to it you
know and
and before having too much of it you you
go vacation again or you go somewhere
and do something else again and if you
do if you do that you can i think you
can play for life this game because
it's really an interesting game that is
uh
that can take you every day
uh
longer long hours and you see you still
enjoy it but you still have to keep in
mind that it's important to
to add some
small breaks that will make you enjoy
more the grind and the more you enjoy
the grind the better you play also
because the more you enjoy the better
you you give yourself like the the more
close to your a-game you play basically
because we are not bots we remain humans
so even if you have like
you study a lot of the game or you have
like the perfect strategy and stuff you
will deviate from the the
the strategies by by your mood and your
mental this is
it has to be like that like you will you
will increase your frequencies you will
you will change many things by uh
because of your mood so you need to
treat your mood and your mental
uh
as an asset to play
your a game
yeah that's this this is uh yeah i i i
think this is key for
breaks contribute right
what
breaks will contribute to that
yeah they contribute and also balance
with uh i think sexual life and uh
and relationships with friends
so because many poker players they they
are really too much alone
and it happened to me also and i i guess
it's uh
because our game is uh is a
individual sport and uh it takes so much
time it's very time consuming so
we tend to negotiate our
relationships
or to have less relationships with
people and also
there is a time so where you burn out
because of
of the lack of relationship with people
so
it always
it's also an asset to
toward the relationship more like
true relationship to your life which is
not easy because it takes time to like
for someone who wants for example
uh wife or children or family or to
someone who wants like really
friends be friends with
with people he can trust and everything
like trust needs to be built
like friendship needs to be built
and it takes time
out like the time where you build those
relationship you cannot grind so
basically you lose money uh by not
grinding but in a certain way you create
your balance that makes you play more
your a game for the time you are playing
uh
yeah it's it's it's really complex like
uh
because life and poker are so connected
and
pocket is like so much life consuming
and money consuming because in a certain
way you play your own
bank account so you you basically is the
only game where you play
with your bank account where you involve
your finance so
it's uh
it's really you involve your finance all
your time and playing 12 hours a day
it's like
who who worked 12 hours a day except
some entrepreneurs but
they don't need to they they they choose
it also like like poker players but yeah
so it was a bit random ideas but like i
think it speaks to a lot of poker
players that listen your podcast
oh for sure and dude i mean adam has uh
was a professional poker player i'm
obviously a professional poker player so
i know exactly what you mean right and
also i would say that the we talked
about this i think in the past before as
well the person who you need to become
or who you need to be in order to be
very successful at the poker tables is
not necessarily the person
that leads to more success in a
relationship right you have to kind of
switch
you know turn your emotions a little bit
off be a little bit more cultivars in
relationship we want to be a little bit
more warm for example
yeah
so going uh
you talked about the beautiful game and
how uh
how the way that the money is involved
also makes it very interesting you you
mentioned uh in our questionnaire that
already i think from a very young age
you were
in touch with games uh you played chess
since you were five years old how did
you get in touch with chess at that age
and what was it about chess
that you liked more than for example i
at that age was probably building sand
castles right why were you at the chess
tables and not building sand castles
like me for example
now i was watching uh
also the
cartoons and stuff but of course i i i i
started uh discovering chess at five
years old because my grandfather was
playing uh
the sunday when we were spending time to
the the grandfather and grandmother they
they were always having a
some chess game between like let's say
my grandfather and some of my uncles and
i was watching them and i wanted to
play as a child because it's like it's a
game so it looks like
friendly for a child and
and so i i learned the rules i guess
like the rules are not too complicated
to understand and then i could play so
i went uh
they put me at six years old in a club
club for children where they play chess
so it's a club where
you basically play chess on saturday
afternoon with a
teacher
so yeah i play competitively in from
from that age
those like children competition and i
can maybe
[Music]
second in my region region is like
i don't know there is like 50 of those
in france i think uh region like it's
how can i say english i think it's
region the world yeah
yeah region like second of my region
which is loren
at age nine so i qualified for the
french championship which were like the
three first of all
of every region of france and i came
like mid
mid
in the middle like maybe 40 or something
or 40 or 50 play so uh but yeah i was
playing for competition uh
at some point quite hard because i was
playing uh
i was having like lessons on wednesdays
saturdays
i have a i was having tournament every
sunday
with a team so you move city with a team
of adults actually i was playing
at nine years old with the adults and
beating of course many of them but
that were not professional of course and
i was not professional also but uh
so but i was playing in uh in adult team
um on sundays and now i had like another
two private coaching um
on
twitter
nights uh evenings of the week so that
was my my my routines when i was young
because by i think my father was a
competitor in uh in the uh table tennis
he was
at uh
his young age first french player and
then
as an adult
top ten and
so i guess he wanted me also to
perform in something that i liked and i
really liked chess so i i think he
helped me to at that time to
to perform by by understanding that the
coaching was uh was was key
uh
probably that helped me later on with
poker to understand that when you want
to perform and
and be good at something like you need
to get coached by by people who made it
before that sounds quite logic but
most of people under underestimate the
value of
being coached
so
yeah that was really good i i just quit
at 10 years old because i was
burned out i guess as a child i wanted
to
to watch more pokemons or stuff you know
than
to play uh competitively again and for
maybe you don't manage your emotions
very good as a child i was like very sad
to have lost not
finish first of the competition in
france or something and and just give up
you give up way more as a child i guess
than others
so yeah i kind of give up and then
i never played chess again except maybe
20 times in my life since then in
the last 20 or 30 years so
i'm probably really bad but it was a
very interesting game i was 1700 euro
for people who play chess at nine years
old
which is uh decent i think but for for
my age at the time
um
i don't know how they use the
classification nowadays but it was
called hilo elo and i was 1690 i think
at my maximum
in uh
yeah in slow games i think
two hours per people or one hour i don't
remember exactly when i was 30 people
when it was getting so competitive did
you then notice that
you started to enjoy it less
no maybe i i stopped getting more
emotional about it you know you know in
the one way and the other like let's say
when i was winning i
i was getting way more involved and
way more emotional about it and more
yeah excited and when i was losing same
thing you know
it's probably the case when you you go
in competition in any of those things
and versus playing for fun or playing
just
regularly but with not too much
uh important stuff like always not too
many uh
yeah uh
important stuff yeah i think also the
more time we invest in something the
more it starts to become part of our
identity so you have your own and you
have you on the chess player and at some
point if you just spend so much time
those things kind of fade and then if
it's joe and the chess player who loses
the chess tournament it also transitions
a bit too into johan his personal life
right i'm it's not like yo on the chess
player field but it's like oh i feel now
as well it start this is what you said
you you start to have more trouble
dividing these things emotionally
oh yeah well and i think in poker it's
even more the truth i think in poker
it's definitely
like every poker player that do that for
a living or even i think those who do
that like
really really often they they have the
same feeling as the people who do it for
a living like we definitely are the same
the same person
in poker and outside of poker i mean
like it's it's
we think about poker even in real life
always and
and it's really one one entity i i i
never divide uh poker and
me
i think it's it has always been one
entity i also would confess that i never
divide uh
my life bankroll and my uh
poker bankroll so
i
for me it's all in one it has always be
all in one
uh doesn't mean that i'm all in or
something it's just mean that i i
i consider my bankroll as my my my all
my savings so
i'm definitely the the kind of of person
that is uh
not making a separation between uh
poker and
my life yeah
i don't know if it's good or bad i think
even if you avoid to make if you try to
make separation and everything when you
play
at a high level or something you
it's almost impossible to make a
separation i guess like
it's it's gonna be
better to accept i guess and that it's
one thing and to try to optimize
optimize optimia optimize it the maximum
at the best i guess it's the same for
tennis player or something
i think i don't know exactly but i think
it also depends on where you are in your
career i can imagine if you start out
that it's way more important right
because also how much you spent how much
you earn will influence the life that
you have but for example at this phase
that you're now in your career you can
kind of merge the two because one will
not have a drastic
impact on the other in the short term
yeah
yeah when you're at the beginning it's
even more important i guess first year
especially of your career and stuff when
you start
going pro
yeah yeah that in the beginning it's
very important to do your finance as
well speak from personal experience in
the in making mistakes in that area that
has huge compound effects so everyone
listen be smart with your money earlier
in your career uh transitioning into
chess you also mentioned that
you
later went into playing video games if
i'm not mistaken you wrote down that you
ranked number one in 40k dawn of war and
you also participated in the world cyber
games which i assume is sort of
the world series of online gaming
again
just like with chess
you took it quite serious right
is there what is there about
you doing something that you want to get
very good at is that something you do
consciously is that unconsciously
yeah uh
well i think when when i like the
strategy game or something and i i
let's say i have friends or people uh
that i know uh very good that that like
the same game let's say for chess was my
family and for
for down four was a few
few friends
[Music]
i want first to beat them so that's
that's a tendency that i notice in me
once i beat them i want
i want to beat other people that are
that i don't know yet that are good in
the game
uh
so
[Music]
yeah i i try to improve in the game uh
and put many hours into it
and think a lot about it
uh try to consummate the maximum content
about the game and the strategy of the
game that's what i did with down of war
uh downfall is basically the
have you ever known the the figurines
that you paint the the little warhammer
that you paint and
no those are like you can buy in shop
basically you uh
you use like some glue
super glue you you can put them uh all
together because they are like in pieces
you know and then once you put them all
together you have to paint them
um
then you can use them to play
on a
on a table
where you put like fake grass
yeah you put like fake grass on the
table
and this fake grass is like you buy in
shops also and you put like some houses
and and whatever like you can make uh
your own land
okay on that land
uh you bring your army
that you paint already
and
the other guy bring his army that he
depends uh already
so this army is used um
so it's a game where you play uh
um like chess you know like one has to
choose his decision then it's the other
one it's one run run run by run it's not
in real time you know
uh and games are
approximately three four hours one heads
up
and the book of the rules of the game is
like that big you know it's like a
really complex game
every unit that you have has different
power and different weapon and for
example to touch your opponent you use a
meter like for example this unit can
shoot
up to like let's say 30 centimeter
so if you know your unit is 30
centimeter away from opponent unit then
you can shot them then you use dice so
there is a bit of variance because for
example
one unit has maybe six uh solder
so you use six dices
and
they have like precision let's say like
uh
for
like 50 percent then it's if it's four
five or six then you eat the the the the
opponent you understand if it's like one
two or three then you you missed
so
um every unit some units have like 80
precision you know and and and and then
there is damage and everything damages
everything so it's like really complex
but it's really interesting it's uh it's
actually very strategic it's a lot of
macro macro
a lot of macro
so this is the game
on the
not it's not a video game at the
beginning
it still exists there is competition all
around the world it's called warmer so
it is a warmer battle which is like the
the people from the medieval uh
age or
it's uh warmer 40k which is the futurist
warmer the one i was playing basically i
was playing dark eldar and basically
warmer the 40k is the same game but in
on the video game but in real time so
it's basically uh like age of empire or
whatever
or
starcraft you know so you build your
units you build your um
your base
uh you try to get the map control
and you just basically needs to
annihilate the opponent and those heads
up are like one versus one or like
between
i would say 10 minutes and
one hour
for the longest but like 10 minutes and
40 minutes you know
and in this game i was like maybe top
top one at some point in the world
online and
and i played i participate towards a
game where i i failed also kind of
because i came like
fifth french and i was fabulous and
stuff so i i didn't even qualify for the
world thing uh live in in the live
competition
but online i was really competitive on
that game i was uh between 16 and 18
years old when i was playing that and
the the the figurines won the the the
one i described before i was playing it
from age
13 to
16.
i was not very competitive in that one i
was playing at a
region level with with people from my
club and stuff like that there is club
there are clubs also where you meet
people playing that thing all night
yeah i also saw you i also saw you
played some magic the gathering i also
played something with the gathering it
was like a similar vibe right yeah yeah
i was playing magic also not very
competitive but with friend and having
different decks on period which was
carnage
uh miradine and seventh edition so that
was my yeah what was in the same time as
media yeah i remember nice i had a
exact exalted angel deck
uh some context of him uh i don't know
orim county i guess in english uh which
is an older card that i use with
isaac isochronic scepter or something
like that in english but people who
knows magic will understand but they
don't understand
i always give a lot of details about
those games because i guess like when
i'm listening to podcasts
i actually like when i know some games
that i was playing i actually happy that
the guy the guys are speaking deep about
it you know like yeah yeah yeah
about poker your channel but
you know like you never know like those
people like many of your viewers many of
our
people who follow us they they
definitely played some some of the games
we did we played so yeah
yeah and i think these are all very
important experiences that happened in
your life that made you the player
that you are today right that's why we
always find it very interesting to start
here uh when someone has an indeed a
history in gaming for example so what i
really see with you is that you're
really driven by the challenge right you
want to first beat your friends then you
want to see okay who's better who can i
beat is that then the fact that your
level also rises when you play against
other players is that a way that you can
develop and do you get satisfaction out
of seeing yourself getting better
yeah yeah that's true that's
that's how i get uh
a lot of satisfaction i think at uh
attu at the ego level i guess but also
uh i become better by
absorbing the
uh trying to understand the mind of the
other player that is better than me for
example and uh and trying to become
to take the best qualities that he has
to add them in my game
um
i i i i
always worked in uh in a copy mode i i
like to copy paste
things that that that i find on people
that work you know like skills stuff
like that
uh nowadays there is uh
there are many other ways to learn i
guess but when you combine all the
the different uh
ways to
that are available to learn i i guess
you can become like some some really
good
player in
in any any game
does this um does this drive to be
challenged also have some negative
consequences that you've experienced
like being very competitive and always
trying to find someone who's better than
trying to beat them does it have any
negative consequences on your life
yeah the negative can be uh
can be that you never get really
satisfied because
you get satisfied but it's not really
long
it doesn't last really long because
there is always someone that is better
so
basically there is always another
competition where
players are more competitive than you
and
so it's really rare i guess to be not to
be really satisfied i guess when you are
like that because you
[Music]
you just get satisfied basically if you
have the best of the world i think and
even if you you to stay the best of the
world i think you you have i've never
been the best of the world in any of
those games i've been maybe first in
down of war
at some point but maybe for for a couple
weeks or something and it was like
and that's the thing right it's not
static it's not like okay you're first
now you'll be first forever it takes a
couple weeks and someone else surpasses
you so it's awesome legend infinite yeah
yeah that's true some legend do by the
way some legend like in in every of
those area chess
video game or even poker they they stay
they stay first of the world
admitted by many people or many
competitions
during many months and even
sometimes many years when you when you
consider for example michael jordan
tiger woods or
i don't know like
nadal or
djokovic but still you know
if you need to be nadal or djokovic or
tiger woods or michael jordan to be
really fulfilled then
not a lot of people will be fulfilled
and probably will never get fulfilled
uh so it's um
i guess it's a balance where you need to
to not get too much frustrated by by
by uh by those things because then if
you get too much frustrated but those
things you will never enjoy but um yeah
i have this a bit it
it makes me feel frustrated when uh
if i cannot be the best but of course uh
it's gonna well
when did you realize that this was like
a trap
was there a specific moment in one of
your careers in the gaming earlier or
did that come later and where you
realize oh [ __ ] i'm just chasing i think
i just realized
i see i i think i'm just realizing now
at age 3 uh because of poker uh i think
before i didn't realize that i i think i
was not putting words on that i think it
was too
too complex to understand at that point
i was just wanting to
to be uh better and better but i was not
putting words i think i realized now
because of experience and because
uh now that i'm i'm playing also i
rollers in poker and i
playing like 100ks i played the 250 in
uh in in vegas 250k buying um it's like
i play with the best of the world it's
it's insane how much uh
how good they are like they like
for me i i have i have a lot of respect
for them and i think like when i see
some of them i think like i have so much
work to do and um
yeah so it's um
that motivates you now in a more
positive way it's not like it's oh [ __ ]
they're so far behind they still have to
do that
you you the way you said it there was
positivity around it's like
and negative it's positive because
uh yes i use it as a as a
as a challenge as a
it drains me to be better it drives me
it drives me to be better and it's and
the negative part is
bro like when does that end like when do
you like finish the game when do you
finish poker you basically never finish
poker so that's uh
that's the negative part where you want
to finish the thing and you think like
okay i will finish this thing but let's
say even the guy won't
win the main event of the world series
of poke because in poker we tend to say
okay this is the world champion blah
blah blah
but this guy is
he doesn't feel like he is the first in
the world because he is not he knows it
and
and i guess
many people think oh if i win the main
event on fourth series is game over gg
it's 8 million gg
but bro uh no you will
first of all you will you will feel
fulfilled during few days
maybe a few months
then you will be like okay what is next
i want to beat
those guys in high rollers and this is
completely another competition
uh most of the main event champion of
world series they they they can't even
play iron they they played few of them
and then they give up because they saw
it was competitive for them um
[Music]
so yeah it uh
they i i guess they don't get fulfilled
because most if they have this attitude
of wanting to be the best they can get
fulfilled because they feel okay i i
want maybe this big tournament that is
recognized in the world
uh or maybe this
super
it can work for online player also if
you are like super top player online in
cash game
then you want to play uh
and to show the world that you are the
best but to show the world that you are
the best you need to go out of your
computer because the world is not
watching you on the computer except few
of the people that are in the pokemon
uh that are in the cash game even not in
the poker world like in the cash game
specific online cash game world
um
so you are like malinowski and you you
you just want to play those high rollers
in fact you played the those iotas you
won one of them uh last year in cyprus
250k buying he won it
and probably
what drive him is not the tournament
format i think he probably doesn't even
like it
um
which most of the cash game players
don't
i'm initially a a tournament player then
a long time of my life i i used to play
cash game and
and then eventually i switch again to
tournament but i'm still playing cash
game but
so i i know exactly what is the feeling
of cash game player
towards tournaments like
they ate it most of the time and they
are kind of right like this is like a
bit [ __ ] compared to
cash game to be honest i'm cash game
player in the mind more than the
tournament player
um it's a bit [ __ ] because we are
too shallow and everything but there is
so much things
to know about like shallow stacks and
stuff so it's so complex i i think if
people just say ah no tournaments is you
know whatever they they haven't went
into detail in my opinion tournaments is
way more complex
it's super complex but it's also not uh
i don't know it's not the same uh
it's not very interesting compared to
i don't know for some people it might be
more interesting for some people
casually might be online something i i
really think uh cash game especially
deep cash game live uh it's way more
interesting and probably because it fits
better my lifestyle
of like uh uh traveling and just like
playing when i want stopping when i want
playing in nice places and stuff
probably that's the reason why i lost so
much uh live cache game and i guess it's
my favorite format by far
no you hear that for online players as
well right for example a a online
tournament schedule for me would be
killing i like the fact that i can just
grind in the day
start whenever i won't stop whenever i
want exactly what you just said right
yeah this is so hard the online
tournament schedule is like so uh they
are the most i respect them the most i
think i i it's it's it's so complicated
because mentally
and also what you mentioned you combine
it with your personal life your
relationship it takes a toll
yeah it takes all tournaments online
tournaments are like wow
i i did that grind during like maybe
three four years at the beginning and i
i know this is a hustle this is like so
frustrating so
um saw everything at the same time so i
i guess like
when you want to be the best uh you kind
of need
to go in
outside of your comfort zone in some
other format that you didn't want to go
at the beginning just because to be the
best
you need to
prove the world that you are the best so
you need to play what the world wants
you to play
which is very very tricky
which is very tricky because it's uh
it's forced you to to go in areas where
you are not the best
uh like but some people manage to do it
and i have big respect for someone like
malinowski who did it okay did it
once on one big tournament but
i'm sure this guy uh
is one of the best of the world and
i like that just to say like hey guys
i've done it you know there's nothing
anymore to prove why would i continue
yeah and there is still something to
prove because other people will say okay
you did it once maybe you got lucky yeah
now you need to grind it you know
uh but i i yeah
i would i would love to speak with other
like uh i speak actually with uh people
but i would love to speak publicly for
uh super content for for people who
watch
uh youtube videos uh about
those things with other like
world-class champions but you are one of
them online cash game so
it's very
interesting to have your opinion also on
on those
in online cash games for example i
actually know i think a lot of the
isaac's online cash game players also
they actually like it that way they like
the fact that they're in the shadow they
like the fact that no one knows them uh
i think that's that's definitely a
characteristic that draws them maybe
also to to online cash games instead of
live circuit life tournaments where i
guess there's more of the elder you know
there's more of the spotlights on you
and some people like that some people
don't
uh
but yeah if you become very good at
online poker congratulations there's now
maybe 100 people in the world that
recognize you as very good they're
probably all male aged between 20 and 35
congratulations that is your external
validation to your career basically
right
that's true
um it's not like you know you walk out
of your apartment and there's girls
throwing their panties at you you're not
a rock star
for that you will probably have to enter
the live scene
not even you're not not becoming a rock
star
in poker ever like uh if you want to be
a rock star like there is no way in
poker like because it's not mainstream
enough
and maybe if you become like hillel
negrano
it can be a little close to it but
really uh
still really far because like for
example like most of the women don't
even watch procare so exactly
comments that will be behind you and
stuff
oh yeah the youtube analytics of this
channel tell me one percent of my
watchers is female
yeah this is exactly the the statistics
it's between one and uh
up to five six percent
so yeah
we made we made actually quite a big
leap because we were talking about
gaming and then at some point you
transitioned into poker you mentioned i
think you went tournaments then you
played cash games for a long time then
tournaments the first time you entered
the casino you played poker and you
mentioned that you were hooked right you
said you played the the 40k dom between
16 and 18 so i guess at some point you
were 18 you could enter the casino you
tried it out you got hooked instantly
what was it about
did you see certain
similar mechanics to the other games
that you could transition into poker
that made you successful straight away
from the beginning or was it
from the beginning no no i was not
successful from the beginning i even
lost at the beginning okay i lost
i basically lost everything that i had
on the side but i was 20 years old so i
am not a lot on the side
those are the
i lost basically the money you know the
money that you you get
when you have like your birthday and
when you are like
all your childhood maybe like a family
give a little bit every time and you
basically put that money on the side on
a bank account that is supposed to be
some bank account that you use to start
in life or something
so you said to start a poker
yeah so i basically it was 3 000 euro
in total and i lost
in three months this morning
so
uh in uh live i i was not playing online
it was in uh
yeah live i was playing live cash game
actually everything live uh tournaments
also like i mean like the tournament
there was like a 30 euro tournament in
the morning
uh in aviation club de france in paris
it's in the chandelier it was like one
of the place that most of the poker
players have been
it's closed since many years now three
open under another name um
but basically this is like
uh the place i was going every day when
i was a radio i was a radio dj at the
time in paris so i was not earning a lot
like i was earning like around 1 200 a
euro a month
and i was going to the
live
circle uh circle of poker we say and
it's uh
playing the tournament on the morning
30 euro playing cash game blind 2-2
which was the
smallest table
uh blind 2 2 saw nl 200 but i was
playing with 50 euro which was the
minimum so 25 blind
um
yeah i was basically trying to apply at
the beginning this uh
strategy that i found online i type on
google
about
short stack strategy and and just like
it it shows you how to
like you play tents plus and just like
ace queen is king just shoving basically
over a race and when there is a race you
you need to fold this queen
like and when there is no race you can
open a race with this queen
uh throw some some some stuff like that
like really nitty and and and it worked
actually because i was like just folding
during hours and just like
shopping over a race sometimes like
there was a race and like three three
calls like every time and then
you end up winning money by doing that
you wreck really little
um
so yeah it was working and i made
probably a few hundred euro like that
like probably five six hundred euros
starting every time from 50 euro
and if i would have continued that for
sure i would have make a bit of money
but definitely
then you you watch some
other content and you don't understand
anything
at poker strategy so you just don't
understand every concept and you just
basically watch
poker after dark with tom duan and ivy
and then you see that poke that tom
dwan's three bet six four sweetie you
know and make a straight you know yeah
does it play ace queen doesn't fold a
screen to a race yeah sure
yeah and like three bet six four sweetie
then make a straight and and take so
much like a
200k port or 300 k boat and you're like
maybe i should open up a bit you know
like this is you understand
you don't that's why you lost your back
row
that's how i lost the 3k yeah
that's how because because
thank you thumbed one thank you tom duan
i start which i played with uh recently
in vegas that's fun because after all
those years i finally played with
someone in cash game
and in the same tournament also but uh
it's very fun you know like
and
um no i was basically
don't under i was like of course i start
flatting
eight nine swedish and
50 euro deep in into two in middle
position against a 7x open another gun
so yeah of course i couldn't win money
like that so i just
basically lost 3k like that
which
make me realize that i cannot
definitely continue because first i have
no money to continue second
i am not a gambler addict or something
so i i
definitely don't
don't want to become one so i started
buying book about pocket at that time
and
my first book was kill elky the book of
elky which is my good friend now
and thanks to that book at that time it
was really good definitely and i
definitely
made back my money in like a couple
months and uh then uh
start uh
winning and i i won like
i was in profit of 10k euro after six
months
uh so like in three months i lost 3k
then i ended up being
recovering my 3k in like two or three
months and then and then i was winning
another 10k in like few months after and
i was deciding to quit radio i decided
to quit
radio which was not paying a lot just to
make poker my my full-time
activity and i moved to from paris to
calgary in sardinia because i'm 50
italian from sardinia actually but
i wanted to see my origins uh i wanted
to learn italian because my parents
everybody always speak to me in french
or i never learned italian so i learned
there i was playing also i wanted to
play lower stacks because i start to
understand about strategy of poker so i
start to understand that i with my
bankroll i cannot play
uh
like not even like 2-2 in life because
it can be too risky so with my expenses
and stuff i i had probably four 4k
bankroll or something you know so four
or four thousand or three thousand five
hundred bankroll
i cannot play two-two uh kind of player
pay a rent and just expect to to do good
in paris so i went to sardinia rent well
cheaper
um live games and i was playing i was
not playing online so live games were
cheaper also i could play 25 50 cents so
nl50 in live with dealer
uh handle 100 also
and tournaments were like they were they
were sitting in the live um
room in a in calgary where i was playing
sitting go of 20 euro 30 euro
50 euro and sometimes there was 100
euros you can go start
so with nine player or ten player
top three paid
i was grinding the city and goes i was
grinding the the cash game after the
season goes i was grinding the
the life tournament that they had like
every day like 50 euro 30 euro buying
with rebuy or stuff
and i was planning those things probably
making 2k a month at the time
uh playing every day by the way so it
was a very poor hourly
but with a lot of wreck
because
those rooms have a lot of wreck like
probably a 20 rack or something
uh i was still a big winner
probably the biggest winner in that room
uh but uh yeah then i i i moved to
online i switched to online and i
continued to play live but
really less compared to online during uh
the next five years
so yeah i don't know if you want to know
the details but basically yeah
let me let me ask one thing and then i'm
sure adam also has a lot of questions uh
that he would like to ask you
my last question uh before i give it
over to adam uh
when you started to finally you read the
book of elky you read a couple of things
that made a lot of sense to you i know
that he's also a gamer right he came
from starcraft if i'm not mistaking
were there them things when you started
to think about poco for yourself with
the help of this book trying to prove
were there then
certain skills that you developed during
your gaming history that you could then
use in poker did you see certain
similarities and how certain games work
compared to how poker works did that
help you any sort of way
[Music]
so
um
yeah i started
noticing that poker was way more complex
than what i expected i thought it was
way more simple than that
so i start to understand that it was as
as
probably as complex as chess and as a
warhammer and stuff
which i didn't even think before i
thought
this game is not that complex it's just
like
few strategies
a lot of luck
ngg
so i thought poker was like that
and i think many people think like that
actually many people who are not pro of
course
many people who are like in the journey
of poker and that's why they don't take
coaching actually
that's why they don't pay for courses
because they don't see the depth of the
game they're like then what's the point
you're not gonna give me anything extra
that's why they think scotch are
scammers also
because pocahontas because they don't
see the deepness of the game and it's
normal they cannot it's so complicated
to see the deepness of the game before
so you don't you think you can find
everything on youtube because
you're like
what the [ __ ] like the guy is just a
coach of poker is like
there is nothing to coach about like
there is maybe like don't play this end
don't play this end and play this end
play descent race big and
gg you know
but so basically
when i started understanding that it was
so much complex that there is like every
stack size uh different strategy that uh
every position uh
different ranges uh post flop you can
use different line um
that basically you will make way more
money by doing that instead of that
when i understood those things
i i
i was like okay this is a game for me
and i will i will i will
try to
to master it
um
yeah your question is more about like
what did i notice specifically that make
me
understand right uh
what's what what kind of for example did
you see similarities in for example the
way you approach strategy in the other
games compared to poker that gave you a
certain advantage that helped you
understand the game better given your
history yeah yeah
so the main thing that i noticed is
especially on post flop game is like
if you can
if you can think what the the other
person has in mind because all the
people especially at the time were
playing exploit strategies so
there was no gto or stuff so
if you can just
know what he's thinking and what he's
gonna do before he's actually doing it
then you have like a big edge on him
and that's the same in um down of war
or in chess
it's like if you can anticipate the move
of the people
the next move of the people the person
then you have a big edge if you can
understand what you think how we think
so what you think about your move how is
what what you think about
uh
what you what you think you're gonna do
if you know what these things you're
gonna do then you can do another thing
that he didn't expect but for that it's
just like basically you need to
yeah i
i was very good at brain
braining my opponents basically at
understanding before
they will do something what they will do
and add understanding
what he thinks i'm gonna do and doing
something else
so just with those competence i guess
i could already do money i was not
studying the game much i was
playing playing playing playing
playing and stuff and studying
indirectly right you saw people make
sure to move you gain information like
oh you do this because of that and then
you could kind of predict what was going
on you could maybe induce certain lines
avoid certain lines
make my autumn analyze after the game
make my
um
reviewing my own hands especially
um after a live session like i was going
home and i was always
making my my autumnal eyes it takes
sometimes two hours i was taking every
end in my because i had every end that i
played like every big big pot that i
played in my in my head so i was
remaking uh
making again that end and say okay what
could i have done differently what uh
why it was a success that end why it was
a fail that then why i lost that then or
why i lost but i think i played good
uh i basically was analyzing if i played
good or bad every end and i was thinking
if there was another possibility to play
it better to play every end better so
that's studying in a certain way but
and you probably did the same in the
other games you played right you use the
same tactic in order to improve like you
analyze your games yeah
same thing same thing probably this is
my my main method since forever i guess
uh i probably use too much of this
method uh event
i need to add more uh different methods
but uh i still have different methods i
use i still use coaching i still
i i watch still a video strategic video
of
top pros um i still i use a bit of
solver but
i definitely need to use
more of
all those things uh because i i i'm
always uh capitalizing on that uh method
that uh that we just talked about and
it's not enough if you if you if you
capitalize 90 of your
study effort on on with with that method
you you will you will you will be
limited and capped so this is
basically
yeah how i did um at the beginning
this podcast is brought to you by poker
ambition where me and adam have created
our coaching program the mechanics of
poker after having reached high sex
poker ourselves we tested out this
philosophy on our cfp students which saw
them rise through the ranks and doubled
their win rate we then took the best
knowledge of that cfp program and turn
it into the mechanics of poker so you
can have that high quality content
without the long-term commitment and
often hefty price that comes with a cfp
program now i will be teaching you the
technical side of how poker really works
how to think about the game and how to
consistently get better and adam focuses
on the mindset and performance skills
you need to know in order to convert all
that technical poker knowledge into more
consistent profits at the table now this
program is high level it's made for
professional poker players who have the
ambition to break free from mid stakes
and move up to high stakes poker so if
you're ambitious about your poker goals
go over to
pokerambition.com for more information
and there you can also find a free one
hour demo of everything that is inside
the program if you have any further
questions don't hesitate to reach out
but without further ado let's get back
to more goodness in this episode
adam
sorry you have been so silent on the
sidelines that i've excluded you people
are like isn't this a co-host podcast
where is adam adam is sitting silently
on the sidelines adam i'm sure you uh
you have a lot to ask
i have i've been enjoying the stories
it's been great listening to all of them
so far hey i've got a
hey how you doing i've got 100 places i
can dive in at but i'd like to dive in
around this kind of transition point
from
your kind of gaming background to going
to poker i think it's very interesting
where i'm guessing going into poker you
probably had quite a big ego you've
chess prodigy one of the top players in
your country you've went into other
games and world almost like got a world
ranking in these other games and then
you've gone to polka and like you said
you you went in with the kind of
pretense that it's not that complex so
when you did start playing poker were
you uh a bit surprised by the complexity
and did you have a big ego going into
poker that you needed to work through
yeah
yeah very very very good read
yeah i had
i have too much i had too much of a big
ego uh yeah i was i was
i was um basically spewing like a monkey
uh because
i just wanted to
to own the people but i had no like
fundamentals and
i was just wanting to
to be the best in the room uh very quick
in the process but i got destroyed
uh
those 3k euro i speak about basically
but it's it doesn't look like a lot of
money of money because it's i was
playing 2-2
but like i was i was playing them 50
euro by 50 euro you know 100 euro by 100
euro
and actually i lost them
by doing completely random [ __ ]
and also after when i started winning
and being a winning player i was still
spewing a lot of course i was could have
been way a bigger winning player if i
was not making the spew i start
buying in 100 deep
instead of 25 deep and um
and yes i start trying to outplay
without really
knowledge about uh
about like not a lot of knowledge so i
was
it was a lot of intuition a lot of uh
trying to do unconventional thing but
like way too much uncommotional so if i
was seeing uh people doing
like let's say i was analyzing the best
people in the room
um that were always always the same reg
like the regs of the of that club
uh and i was trying to see what they do
and i was i wanted to be uh
completely another
another style i wanted to be the
the player that will own them uh playing
a complete other style and wanted to be
remain uh reminded
as someone that is not understandable
not readable
and that is very difficult to play
against
uh which is based effectively
exactly on ego
and it's not
the best way to to win money in poker
[Music]
nowadays someone like adamo
michael adamu that i play a lot in uh in
those high rollers since i play them
he's playing
let's say way more unconventional than
most of the
regs actually
i would say uh he's getting reminded and
everything but he has like a lot
he studied a lot and he's doing stuff
that are solver approved many times uh
where
so it's it's it gets remind by being
good basically
reminded by being good
where i was like
reminded by being a monkey so yeah
i'm still a bit of a monkey nowadays
it's it's never changed on that but like
i'm
of course i have way more strategies and
way more deepness in my game
that i can
manage to
to make good money out of this game but
uh compared to
i have a like i have still those
tendencies to be some somehow someone
that tried to
probably by ego but that tried to be
different
um in my uh my style um
yeah or do something that is not
conventional
yeah so it sounds like your ego took a
big hit quite early on when you lost
that 3000 which was your your life role
coming into poker yeah what was it like
playing a game for money at that time
because obviously before that you played
chess you played the games but there's
no money on the line so you just had to
beat your opponents and you almost had
an unlimited sample size to get good at
those games without too much
repercussions well all of a sudden poker
is bleeding you out you've lost 3k
you've got much more to go for how was
the dynamics of playing for money did
you enjoy the adrenaline or did it
create pressure in the short term
yeah it created a lot of pressure
actually i i fee i feel the
i feared when i realized that it was a
game that could involve that much uh
finances and stuff like say yeah it's
first time you that's why poker is uh is
insane um and that's why poker you
cannot
uh
you cannot dissociate your person and uh
the poker
you cannot go like okay today i'm gonna
play poker like it's a hobby or
something it's just like
so much in into you because of the money
uh that is uh in line so yeah no i was
fearing actually because i'm
i'm a bit risk averse actually i have a
lot of uh
in micro let's say my micro if i have to
say in video games we speak about
microgesture microgesture and macro
i don't know if it's the same term in
english i think yes
yeah you know what is it right yeah
micro macro yeah okay so my micro okay
for some people who don't know we're
gonna define micro how do you define
micro and macro for people who don't
know what we are talking about
yeah it's um is macro the kind of
broader concepts and micro is like the
more in-depth more the zoomed in version
for example macro of the weather is all
the seasons whereas the micro would be
summertime or the winter times it's like
a
building into bricks that's the way i
would think about it
okay i like it and i would define it in
poker i would say maybe the micro in
poker would be hand by hand like a one
poker hand the macro will be your
bankroll management uh the
the the table selection the
some macro concept will be the how you
basically use your time to study the
game uh stuff like that that make you
win more money at the end basically
uh and micro decisions are the decision
that you're gonna like why i'm gonna
take this line on the river instead of
this line what up
what uh what i'm gonna do preflop in
that spot this is more micro decision so
i i have always been in uh
in um
in life and in a
video game more of a macro
guy
i think
i have more qualities for macro
than for my micro so macro wizard a
is more my thing so basically
i would go crazy in my pro
and i would almost never go crazy in
macro uh
so i would take a lot of risk in
in uh in the hands or
in specific ends or in lines
and i would not take any risk almost in
uh in bankroll management or in
in
in using my time correctly in
i will not go mad i will not go crazy i
will not do things that i will regret in
life or something i will be always like
kind of disciplined uh on overall uh
on my overall schedules and stuff
so
i was uh
yeah i was feeling when i i realized
that poker was was a lot
touching my macro
when it was touching my macro i was
this is too much for me now i cannot
take any risk anymore i would never put
money again in poker except
except the money that i will win that
that i would have won in poker so
basically i i was i'll just put
a bit i start winning back my
my my money
uh i started making 10k profit and then
i was like okay if if i lose my bankroll
again
i'm gonna be done with this game i'm not
gonna i'm not gonna take another shot
uh to use uh
money of a work of hard work or
something to to play poker so i was
reading to give up actually uh at the
beginning but i didn't add two
and
yeah then i managed
pretty good let's say my step-by-step
career overall i would say by by gaming
by the choice of the format that i
played
in the in the good timings i think i i
played online cash games when
people were saying it's too late but
actually it was uh still very profitable
especially on dota fair and italy that's
where i was playing
french sites and italian sites
um
it was 2013 14 15 and a bit of 16.
so that's where i made probably
somewhere around 2.5 million hands
and
one
after wreck back and
everything like around 500 550k
so
i use
instead of continuing on online cash
game i moved to
lifecache game at a period where people
were
saying this is not a format that you can
grind so
i moved to life cash game in 2000 end of
2015 in las vegas there were only
american raids
and fish
there were no online rags
so people were way behind the
online level that i
that i got uh
at the time
so i started winning
pretty big in those like i make my first
six figure months in in vegas in those
2550 game which was the biggest there
were not too much big games in hold them
at that time
like regular game
so
yeah i think i choose pretty
smartly my formats and nowadays
i'm choosing formats that are like these
are really big games in cash game where
there is a lot of
money on the table
with different kind of profile there are
vips
businessmans
and also some very solid right
and
so i'm getting
also invited to more games than
than most of the
pros i would say um because i give
action also because i
yeah
i i i don't think i play conventional so
that's that's probably one of the reason
and
people can make good money on me uh in
in
in some hands uh good for them i will
give them action i mean like recently i
my last two big games were
200k ports uh
i i five-bed jam pre-flop so maybe
that's one of the reasons i get invited
i don't know like i know i'm i have this
cra i do those crazy thing and it's like
it's like that i i i
if i think he's bluffing me i'm gonna
put the trigger pull the trigger
so i was wrong uh many times in my
career
in micro let's say in micro but overall
in macro how i manage my my overall
career and shoes of
of uh formats and stuff i i made good
decisions that lead me to where i am now
able to play uh my all action in in
in 100ks and
and and that's what i that's what i do
but uh also those eye rollers are very
tough um even uh if uh the
[Music]
they are very tough so i think i have a
lot of work to do to be able to
to to one day uh to when they
succeed very hard on those errors so
this is maybe not my
the format that i
i was the most smart to choose
it's more because i like competition i
like challenge so now i'm i'm giving a
try i'm willing to give a try
if i lose few millions
then maybe i will give up that format
but
if i don't lose few minions
maybe i'm gonna stay you know so i'm
i'm basically in that phase of my career
where
i'm
playing big cash games
and big tournaments live and i'm almost
only playing live nowadays
yeah i got bored of the online grind
i did that too much too many ends i did
also
probably around 20 000 mtt's uh
between 2010 and 2014 then i was playing
only sundays the rest of the years
but um
but yeah
i think i got bored i think i'm i'm
older now i want more
travel uh
living life
uh
meeting nice people like very
interesting people like businessman that
i play with or professional poker
players that i play with are very very
interesting they are very smart
they are good investors in different
areas that i like i like crypto um
i i sold most of my crypto that also
helped me to
to be
more wealthy and play bigger
that was a big jump
for my bankroll
because i started investing in 2017
early
like early half of the year mid of the
year
so
it's one of the reason i when when when
crypto peaking uh
like
one year ago and stuff like it
and i saw there that was that make me
made a really really good profit so yeah
super interesting yeah so hearing you
speak there it was almost like your your
whole career you've been treating like
one big game almost like a game of chess
and you've navigated your like you said
the macro strategies very well so for
you that's choosing the formats you're
playing
game selection bankroll management and
always having these kind of higher level
concepts and where you're navigating
your career which i think most players
don't do this very well most players get
locked into one format whether it's
online alive and they're not thinking of
the bigger game of like what what
opportunities are out there it sounds
like you were very very good at that and
then we've got these kind of micro
strategies that you were talking about
or you might be very spontaneous you
might be very
rash throw some chips around but you
know that's just like a small part of
the big picture the big picture is
getting the right games management
bankroll so it's almost like you're uh
yeah almost like a chess player playing
this this whole game of life and poker
together and navigating that space would
that be a somewhat accurate
representation
yeah i think you have good reads on
people
yeah very accurate uh it's
cool all right so one thing i want to
dive into which came up in the
questionnaire which i thought was an
interesting answer we asked if your
family was supportive for you and you
said your family weren't supportive of
you at first playing poker so first
question with this one is what were your
parents wanting you to do at that age
because i know for you obviously you
have what put in chess with your
grandparents and your parents there's
probably some sort of academic or at
least some projection that they've got
for you so when you started playing
poker what would they rather you were
doing at that time
so um
yeah they wanted uh i mean uh i was a
radio dj i was already uh
um
i was already telling them since many
years that i was i was about to do
my career i was doing like i would do my
career in media so in being a
presentator
animator
anime doing animation of of talk show
that's what i wanted to do that's what i
was doing but when i realized that i was
not making
money because this is like paying really
poorly um and it's really long
because most of the people who get paid
are way older than
20 years old they are like
on their 40s they have 20 years career
before getting like it's almost
it takes like 10 years plus to get paid
decently in those uh but i it took me uh
two years to figure it out
i thought
i could like just keep the steps so
basically i was convincing my i was not
committing i was like
ending myself from
from uh from uh
from the moment where i decided to play
poker because
when i knew uh if i was failing i could
always go back to
the house of my parents i would say like
many young people
nowadays can do that when they have
parents that have a house
they would always accept them at age 20
22. so i was i i knew i was not going to
the streets
but
they were uh
wanting me just to succeed in what i
wanted so which was radio
um but then when i decided to play poker
of course they see that as a gambling
and they see that as
as not a career
as as not a possible career so they they
would discourage me to do so and
they would say me if you do that then
you will lose a lot of
uh your
your effort that you did to to become
more famous in radio and stuff and you
will lose and
you will lose the
the attraction of the owners of those
radio that that would not
be um
choosing you anymore and stuff because
you would you would not be present
anymore and stuff so they would
discourage me in that way when i would
have them on the phone
um
which i guess was for my
not not a bad thing because like
if you if you are from the generation of
my parents then you are not um
familiar with uh
esports
high level esport people or high level
poker players because
there was no competition in poker before
our time so we basically are early birds
for poker like dolly bronson and stuff
where making money in cash games in life
cash games during many years
but there was no
classification tournaments hand and mob
all those years so we basically are the
generation
me you rene uh
that disco that
are leaving the
competition of poker like the
yeah pocahontas or sports
so our parents don't know about it um
so
yeah they have no bad intention and i
guess all people of our generation have
the same issue with their parents with
poker
so i didn't
i was not angry about that and
later on my father became my biggest
supporter so like is since many years my
biggest supporter is like watching all
the coverages you know on poker news and
stuff he's reading everything he's
reading
the the flips you know he's reading
the handy stories he's watching the
streams he's watching my stream he's
watching my youtube videos he's watching
reading my book
on amazon he's uh he is like just doing
everything he knows he's even like
playing a bit of poker like he just
likes the game now you know and uh
so it's very nice that you see the
transition between
like uh being
being my parents fearing about it
and not and now completely opposite my
mother knows now
like because she see a lot of interview
of me magazines cover of magazines uh i
was in tv in france for poker like i was
a coach in amazon bluff it's a tv show
in france that was uh i was the coach
the last two seasons of that tv show
it's like big brother but people play
poker all day um and get eliminated in
poker then they get a 100k contract if
they win the
100k live tournaments contract um so
yeah
this is uh
by by those just like when your parents
see you succeeding by numbers by uh also
by uh fame in the game
then you don't they don't have the same
opinion anymore and
and this is also uh
one of the reason i was so much into
hustle is like i wanted to prove to my
friends my parents because friends had
almost same opinion as parents like
friends outside of poker they would
think you are making a mistake or
something
so
when you can prove them um
by your results that
you
you made the right choice then it's a
really good feeling you know and this is
a way that you say okay i end up i
finish the game in the second half so
for me people it's enough they will say
okay i finished the game i make a living
about every spoka everybody knows that
i'm making a really a really good living
compared to most of the people i'm
actually making a little bit
for some people it's completely
happiness and and done for me it's not
enough as we said of course i will
always which try to reach the next step
but
it was really a good milestone uh at
that time
yeah that was a really inspiring story
because i think a lot of players are in
that situation where they're not getting
supported by their parents like you said
like your parents are from a generation
that don't understand poker they have a
lot of fears a lot of worry they think
you're throwing your life away you're
going to end up in loads of debt it's
not going to work out and you've got to
prove them wrong through your longevity
of making money and creating a good life
circumstance through a very
unconventional path and i think a lot of
players try to uh get approval too early
they get to try to get support from
friends and family just because they're
taking that path when in reality success
and long-term results and sustainability
is where you're going to get that kind
of validation long term and sometimes
doesn't come so for you your dad being
your biggest fan i love that story like
watching your stuff watching your
streams reading your books i think like
a lot of players would love that maybe
their biggest dream would be to uh get
their dad's approval on that kind of way
so i'd say the ultimate kind of version
you may not get to that level with kind
of validation from your peer groups but
over time people do start to show
respect and like okay he knows what he's
doing he's got this covered i don't
worry about him yeah obviously you've
had a lot of success publicly so your
friends and parents can just see all
right even though i don't understand it
that well your dad does but your mum
might not he's doing really well and we
can we can stop worrying he's got to
cover he's a small guy and he's doing
well for himself so yeah i think it's a
a really good story i'm sure many
players will be aspiring to to get the
point you're at right now so find a
question on this one what about
different different segue in we talked
about basically you losing your 3k role
and then you read elky's book and you
went back in there to kind of build your
role back up you got that back and you
got a point where i think you said you
get about 10k with your role and you
said i think you said like you went you
have to you're going to continue that
strategy of liking his grinding in the
casino there so what was your next move
when you wrote about 10k a bit of
stability you've overcome your initial
kind of uh
busting episodes what was your next step
after you after that point
so i arrived as i said in calgary i
played you know all those city goals
live can go from 20 euro to 100 euro i
was grinding them grinding the 25 50
cents
cash game 51 so all the basically live
offer that they had i was grinding and i
was making approximately two care months
in profits so playing every day though
so like it was really low early i was
not counting my hourly at that time but
if you play every day 12 hours seven
days a week
probably may 94
so 170 340 hours a month in making 2k uh
you're making what 10 euro now uh
10 10 euro an hour i'm not even you're
making like five euro an hour or
something
uh
so yeah this was really
low hourly
and uh so
i was at that time um
uh playing for that because i loved the
game also it was all my life i was
thinking just about poker every day i
was not even having i remember the first
year i was i didn't have any relation
with any girl like it means like zero
like not even a kiss you know
like the first year in calgary i was
just
with a beard you know like big beard
like not even taking care of myself you
know just like going to brian and it's
not me i was like social as [ __ ] before
that going out
and uh i always been like
like very social very very party guy a
lot of success also uh with women in
general like
uh just
i was becoming a nerd like a nerd you
know like
very nerdy um and um
[Music]
so then i i figured out that this is not
the way i want to live long run so i
just uh
discovered online poker
um
i i i scaled with online poker because
of
online entities so i was grinding uh
average buying 40 euro i would say on
dot affair and italy
um i made
approximately 200k profit in
those two years
so this was really
more interesting in terms of
um
freedom that i that i got by having a
bankroll
um
standing around like 40k 30k 40k because
like when you make 200k profit in two
and a half year you don't have 200k
bankroll of course
but uh because you spend because you
have like fees and everything but
whatever you just like add like around
40 sometimes 50k bankroll and i could uh
travel um
which was a mistake probably because it
was too early in term of uh bankroll
management but it was i was not doing
crazy thing you know i was doing uh
400 500 euro buying on
four days event you know like very deep
low variance stuff
uh still full variance because of live
entity but
really less value that online player
used to think
i was playing those but i was playing on
the side cash game that was
the smart move i was playing those two
four five five in casinos where i was
making uh really decent money probably
some hourly around 80 euro 100 euro
um
then
after that
what was the big scale the big scale
came when i started discovering online
cash games in 2013
uh
everybody of my entourage was poker
pro's uh french or italians and they
were all mtt player
so they were they were all for them like
the poker is only mtt it's only about
one day make the big score in some live
tournament or some big scoop on.com
or whatever
that was the goal of every of my
pokepro's friend
who had like same bankroll as me or a
little lower a little higher
and so with that entourage with that
kind of um because we are the sum of the
five persons we take on the most this is
uh
really true in life and in poker also
so i could only be like them you know
then one day and thanks to
those regs that were invited by the room
uh because of wreck back
those online cash game ranks that arrive
in some spots
on the life circuit in vegas because
they got qualified by the wreck back
that they make
they had to use the package so
if not it's lost so basically i met new
french people that i never met before so
i asked because i'm very social
i asked
guys
what is your nickname
so the nickname
i didn't know so i was like how you are
here so we ask questions they are very
in the like you said before renee said
like cash game players especially at
that time were very uh aware that there
was a lot of money in cash game
and they were very aware of
people not knowing there is a lot of
money in an online casino
or people thinking it's too hard or
or it's
yeah it's not beatable because of the
rare blogger
so they were not speaking and
publicizing
uh online cash game and at that time in
france there was no
coaching sites that were uh explaining
about it
so they were only like before that time
but it was speaking about dot com never
about dot affair
about really so we were not relating
with that we were thinking oh that those
guys are too good they are playing
on.com that's why they make money
whatever so no one knew so i i basically
by speaking with them and one night one
of them was drunk and connects
on his account
uh
on this french
website and at 100k bankroll 300k which
i never see before
like or maybe once someone one entity
but like uh i see six figures and i was
like
how did you make that he said i told you
in cash game
it doesn't make sense you know and i
repeat like what did you win like for me
it was like he won the jackpot
bro i told you i played only cash game
so i didn't win any mtt any uh anything
you know
okay so why it's on the bankroll and why
it's not used or in bank account you
know and i realized i had so many
um limits in beliefs beliefs limit
because i couldn't process that that
number in a online bank
after two years being a pro like two and
a half yeah
so it was uh
very interesting to me so i started
playing cash game and actually i
realized that there was uh
like the hourly was insane compared to
playing entities this is um
probably four times more
this was for i was playing heads up
there was still heads up on most of the
sites so i was sitting in heads up
everywhere uh in 100 and 200
i was sitting in six marks everywhere
playing heads up and six marks at the
same time the good thing is i had
already good skills about multi-tabling
because i was playing 12
to 16 tournaments at the same time
during many years that paired
profitably
so i could directly play uh
like eight uh six marks in cash game and
uh two heads up at the same time you
know so i was playing uh
in heads up it was burmenting basically
it was
sitting on on on on heads up table like
every wreck was sitting you could see
like a list of
20 30 right seated and one out of two
one out of two one out of two then
someone come he choose you then he play
against you so that was how how it was
four heads up but for six months i was
playing every table but table was
running only if there was uh
some
non-reg
so
i was playing that i played two million
ends like that 2.5 million ends
in
three years i made
a bit more than half a million
in profit
all combined uh i use that money to
because i burn out definitely because i
burn out not i don't i didn't burn my
money but i burned out mentally where i
was my routines were like
12 hours grind a night i was playing
from midnight to 12
midnight to 12 every day on 12 uh on 12
or 13 rooms
uh at the same time and i was like
uh equivalent of supernova in four of
them so i had like 30 back
on four of them which is doesn't
probably exist nowadays oh yeah some
somewhere it can exist but
and
i was also making good money with uh
with reg by which was more compared to
what i was making on the tables uh my
if you see like it's so funny i still i
might have a graph still on my website
uh where maybe i have 1.5 million ends
on the on that graph and maybe 250k
profit like this is without the right
back and stuff but and i have like
a red line that is horrible you know
like losing as [ __ ] and it's all about
blue line especially at the time
it's all about showdown winnings like
you you just make make
money at showdown you just make money at
children that's that's how
my style was and most of the regs were
having the same kind of line
um
so yeah
i was making uh
with that money i burn out because i was
playing too much too many hours too many
hours and
and not having a real life so i wanted
again to travel again so i made again
travel
and when i was traveling i was enjoying
the live cash games i was enjoying
playing bigger now with no fear
because now i can play
anything you know like
the games were not big big enough i was
asking for struggle i was like what the
[ __ ] you know like guys you are playing
how come you are playing that small like
you know i was it's one table you know
we need to play big
so yeah i i i i start loving cash game
live cash game again so much and i
played the big
25 50 and higher during many years i met
rene i think at uh
at some cash game table uh in ept but
i'm not sure if it was the case or not
and
it was in malta it was an episode yeah i
i said at the introduction man you tried
to hit my wife in a jacuzzi in the
marriott
so it was not in the table poker table
no no no no and then you invited us over
we were living i was living in bel
mountain you know next year i started
speaking with your wife
yeah you you're trying to hit my wife at
the jacuzzi you were not next to her you
were not no i wasn't there
and then we got started you invited us
over to your place of course yeah set up
with 10 screens i don't know how many
screens you had yeah yeah six screens at
the time
uh yeah because of the multi-rooming so
i had i had no seating script like many
rays just sitting script which was
illegal and i i didn't want to do
anything in my career i didn't want to
do anything illegal at no point so i
decided to find always macro way
to uh
to have the same result or almost the
same you know as the people who use
sitting script so when i was seeing all
the lobby i could sit very quick
uh because i had my eyes on on the
lobbies on other screens and my tables
were on my
main screen in the middle and all other
screens were like lobby but fully uh
shown in 5 10
36 and 10 20. so
yeah because yeah i didn't speak but
then then of course from nl100 and 200
after a few months i was already
playing an l1k so very quick i was
making average 25 25k a month so
when i was playing my 70k ends
uh
in the month so i was grinding the
highest specs of dot affair and italy of
every room during all those years and i
have used all those screens just to to
be able to sit very quick before the
table get full
when when someone come table gets
fulfilled in very very few moments but
yeah because it was the night not too
crowded the the websites because i had a
lot of websites because i had a lot of
vision about what is going on on the
lobbies i could be very quick so that
was my way to to make money and then
after that as i said the live cash games
during all those years and then i
switched to
to play more tournaments because i want
more adrenaline it's like the grind in
life cash games when you make like 400
500 hourly
you get bored at some point because
because you're still making like you're
still playing for me for making one
buying during the day and you are still
you have a background of a few millions
you don't want to just play for making
one buying so it's like
it's a bit like for for someone like me
that likes challenge it was a bit boring
so i started playing high rollers and
and big tournaments
and i enjoyed and i had a really
successful year last year which was my
first year playing full-time
live tournaments so
i hope i will have the same uh this year
for now i'm i'm losing this year uh but
it's beginning of the year so
we will see
yeah what a ride and yeah it sounds like
you're somebody who enjoys like taking
on new challenges taking on new formats
taking on yeah new things to do it
sounds like that early part your career
you got quite lucky because you went
like a box of players who were all
playing mtt's your kind of world view
was quite narrow at that time and then
just by a chance going to the casino
because of that
kind of coupon of buying that you won
and then introducing yourself to cash
game players you're like wait a second
you guys are making a lot of money
playing cash games and obviously in that
moment your curiosity and your
charismatic personality of meeting
people must be a good skill set in that
scenario yeah it sounds like once your
eyes are open you're like wait a second
there's other games going on i i'm i'm
i'm going for the the real money so yeah
really really interesting i like how you
uh piece that all together i was
listening as a fan of your story that
was really really interesting so great
stuff so renee would you like to pick it
up from the hot tub or you want to pick
it from a different point of the story
the hot tub from the hot tub yeah we we
could pick it up
yo yo i'm still playing grinding online
cash because then you mentioned you
switched to live and i was curious like
when you then switched back to life what
verse you mentioned the games were very
good but i'm sure there were certain
adjustments that you had to make in your
game going from online to live yeah what
what were some of the adjustments that
you had to make and what are some things
you think online players that come to
play live uh often do wrong for example
i i played live with you what do i do
wrong tell me it tell me
no but you are you are very good uh in
life also so you you don't do
wrong stupid stuff okay wrong thing no
no no
no um
i would say that most of the online
player what they do wrong when they go
to live and what i was probably doing
wrong
is the fact that
you are not aware of what you give away
physically so
you are like more in front of your
computer with your emotions like
doing the hands and stuff and actually
for people who are used to life it could
be readable
um so you need to be more like
um kind of not moving too much you know
like i would say like not systematic
right in your behavior yeah more
systematic yeah yeah that's that's one
one thing for for online players but
then what they tend to do wrong and
that's really bad for the game
is
they tend to
not
[Music]
create a fun atmosphere
at the table
which is the whole purpose of why
people
who are not professional poker player
play
the game in casino they play
for one reason
who is the main reason it's to have fun
they don't play for making money they
are especially the i speak about let's
speak about what i play so what you play
also already let's speak about eye
sticks let's speak about distance text
like where people play few thousands of
euro in front of them let's don't speak
about the blinds because sometimes you
can play a 510 but the 510 people will
all have 5k in front of them so
we we're going to consider that as ice
text for life let's speak about all the
games where people play few thousands in
front of them and are not professional
poker players why they play they play
because
they want to have a fun night a fun day
this is simple this doesn't make sense
for many poker players especially online
clear because they play for making money
for making owl
so they think unconsciously that
everybody do the same so it's normal to
be
silent it's normal to be just
money-oriented to make tilt other people
to just try to have all the edges to
make the maximum money
no
this is normal for you reality but your
reality is not the reality of
the people who are not playing procare
for a living
so you need if you want
that those games exist always and those
games last long
because
you want also you are only to to be uh
to be you want to be able the most
problematic in poker is like the fact
that we cannot in icetex live catch game
we cannot have games running every time
because games die
games die when
for example there is no um
fun anymore so when there is no fun
anymore like
people stop playing in the game
break okay
so when the game break
then you cannot work anymore as a
professional poker player which is sad
so we are all responsible of the game
breaking
so if we want that this um
continue
the game last longer the fun is
very important who we need to provide
fun
we need to provide
challenge fun
interesting moments nice uh conversation
and not
stuff by being nice or being nice you
know we're speaking about like a game
where we don't know the people or we
know them sometimes
but
we need to make
uh something like very friendly very
funny very uh
nice to be
in and this is not intuitive for most of
the players this is macro part so
i was gonna i was gonna say it it really
relates to your macro micro story a
player goes in and focuses on the micro
whereas you're focusing the macro right
yeah when you focus on the micro you're
gonna increase your win rate on the
short run but you're gonna lose a lot on
the long run and that yeah you you you
basically gain hourly but you cannot
realize that hourly because there's no
game
exactly but you you all you you can also
think all your life as a poker pro then
that it's not your fault
that is the casino fault that is the
the poker is dying that blah blah blah
blah blah but or you can be part of it
and be like
i can make the changement we are
speaking about few tables in the world
that are playing more than 1020. we are
playing we are speaking about
probably less than 50 tables at the same
time that are running in 10 20. i think
it's even less
a
public table you will be very surprised
many people will be very surprised that
in las vegas the capital of gambling
there is no more than
publicly at 2040 running every day
40 dollar big blind this is ice text
yeah it's a highest expert
because people play 5k 10k in front of
them
but it's not the highest thanks that you
imagine there is and many people are
like what there is only 20 40. what
about the 500 1k doesn't exist bro what
about the 100 200 exists but it's
private
so you cannot get only if you focus on
the macro and if you're fun to play with
right
yeah you can maybe access that if you if
you are like that but also it's your
goal to make the public game
um
more fun longer and have more public
games so it's your it's your your goal
to be always whatever game you play
private or public you need to provide
fun and provide fun it's also part of
the
job of professional poker players yeah
so basically we are entertainments
people want to have a good time they
come to the poker table we are
entertainment so they they sort of pay
us to entertain them yeah
okay
yeah and people walk out
yeah
exactly you can imagine what you can do
like when you want to do something you
are you are you have money you want to
do something exciting tonight you can go
in the club but it's always the same
thing you go in a club you take a table
you're gonna spend a few thousand euro
to buy or maybe one thousand euro 500
euro to buy bottles you're gonna get
drunk music is is
whatever but like you can do that uh you
can go to cinema to the movies but yeah
again
if there are any any good movies you can
go to play poker and poker is probably
the most interesting thing that there is
uh
for
for people who wants to enjoy their
night and stuff it's one of the most
entertaining things but it can be very
boring very terrible experience
um
and you don't want to play that much or
that many hours just because the table
is silent as [ __ ] uh boring as [ __ ]
people don't play small games mini games
like seven use
or
maybe a stand-up game you know those are
the games that uh that we play in my
game in malta
those are the games we play at the
bellagio
just make those games mandatory in every
live game in my period that would be so
gossip
seven jews at least yeah the seventies
should be manageable in every like if
you spend online all the combos you
don't need to add all the a3 blank nine
because it can become a bit uh changing
too much the game but let's say 70
should be mandatory why playing a cash
game without the seven juice when it's
the worst and in poker no one play it
and we can make it
it's fun to play with it you know and
like when you see
super pro saying no to seven jews
like weird requested by a recreational
player or even not requested by a crush
a player it's wrong it's just one
yeah i completely agree it's funny i'm
actually starting to feel like the fish
because when i play live i also play for
usually for entertainment i like it so
then when i go to a table and it's all
quiet headphones and also i'm like okay
yeah this is no fun
so yeah i feel a little bit like the
recreation in this case
yeah this is exactly how i feel also
for myself
bringing nice atmosphere it's uh
it's it's it's key so the macro is key
for online player you need to understand
that you come from online one day you're
gonna play live because you will want
playing you will want
you you will want to play bigger or
softer field
so you will want to play live also you
will travel for whatever
and you will have no computer with you
or blah blah you will play live at some
point
so
just remember those things
do it it will be better for all the
pokers in the next
50 years because just live poker will
not die online poker we are not sure
so online program we are really not sure
uh
they they should try to make the online
games fun as well right for example acr
has bump bots it's great yeah i think
it's great we have bumpers in bellagios
we do
bomb bots stand up game seven deuce game
hey i'm i'm in for all the games uh when
you you also play high rollers right do
you see
a similar patterns in the live hierarchy
or is it a bit more serious no no no
they are and and i wanted to
to give a big shout out to them to the
online to the live ranks that play those
they are really really most of them they
are really really professional
and they provide a lot of fun they
provide a lot of good time um
even losing uh during one month in poker
studio in a row i can be done like 300k
i will have a very good uh
many times i will have very good uh
a very good day at the studio even
busting nine for like four paid or
something
uh or
sorry if uh bubble like or something uh
nine for eight paid
um i will just have a nice experience
many times
uh even as a pro and
i think for the
vip they they have a nice experience
also because like the the regs
are very very accomplished in poker and
they're very accomplished in macro also
so they have a very good macro on those
things they provide a lot of fun they
provide a lot of good conversation this
is
yeah this is the the way i want to play
poker all my life i want to play poker
with people that are smart that are
providing value at the table
it's like a dinner you know a poker
table is like having a dinner and in
those hours it's the case maybe the only
moment where is not the case is when
they play really big when they play like
250k
uh but up 200k honestly have 200k
i don't hear almost any difference like
the 10ks like they they are like
everybody is laughing like it's it's
really chill you know the 10k
so the 10ks are like your local 10
sitting goes
definitely
no definitely it's it's not different
than the even the 20 euro citango that i
was doing in calerie was some sometimes
more tense than the 10k that i'm playing
uh in vegas in pokargo studio
um
yeah bravo shoot out 2k cats who have
created a poker studio it's a studio
only for eye rollers only for
hanging out playing big money in poker
but also
having this exclusive place with no
noise no slot machine next to you
not random people that make a lot of
noise or make problem at the table
uh just people who are
playing for fun but for big money but
still for fun provide a lot of fun even
the pros so shout out for that we have
good service good drinks uh good food
coming from the different restaurant of
aya so i really i really i like what
they they build with poker go studio
what carry cats build with
this poker go tour which are all the
high rollers basically um
almost all the errors in the world are
under cargo tour
nowadays so 10k plus it's a poker go
tour except maybe for the epts
except that every every other
so reflecting on uh let's do some
reflecting on your i think it was 13
year long career
what do you think is uh some of the most
what are some of the most important
lessons that poker has taught you
poker has taught me
yeah the most
wait i'm gonna
yeah no this is a big question take a
sip of water prepare
no because i speak a lot um so
poker
made me
read people in life
the intention of the people
way more clearly so
thanks to poker i can read
what is the intention of the people
in normal life
of like a friend
a family person
a girl
whatever person that enters my life i
can i can read
most of the time
very accu
you know accurate mode what she he wants
from me
because of poker because we we are
trained as poker player as professional
poker player to
always ask ourselves what
he wants me to do
in that spot what is representing here
what is my range here what he thinks i
have here so we are always training
training training millions of time
to ask ourselves those right questions
that make us do a logic move to answer
those right questions
so
same for taking decision in life with
the people i take way better decisions
because of poker
in my personal life
in my
business life or
other than poker so i have the
as you know the first coaching website
in french we are not
even concurrent that's a good thing
because i'm doing all my content in
french
so poker pro
this is a business that i i built in
um
because i had a lot of demands from
people following me on twitch
and actually i did twitch because i was
a radio dj not because i start to plan a
business i had no plan i was just
enjoying the
enjoying the twitch grind on the sundays
because all the week i was grinding uh
online cash game so i was uh
i started twitch in 2015.
i was grinding online cash game every
day and i wanted to
to communicate with people i was so sad
i was so so i was making money but i was
so
bored pissed burnt out by by playing 12
hour day burmenting but also playing
like all those six max tables blah blah
blah blah blah
that i one day i decide
okay the sunday it's gonna be my twitch
day i will stream now what i do just uh
what i do in tournament because um i
didn't want
at the time i didn't want to publicize
uh the the cash game streets you know i
didn't want to to show um that it was
really really profitable to be honest so
that was a bit egoist but i didn't want
i was a bit like those cash game player
to keep it for myself and i was playing
the tournaments on sunday on twitch
and i was having fun speaking with the
chat and everything growing my audience
um
so yeah i built a poker pro after one
year of twitch because they were asking
me to give them tips about everything
there i was showing how i played how i
grind the cash game they are showing
everything about the strategies and
stuff
so
um
my business relation with the people i
that's that helped me in the business
um i
i could clearly see that i had like good
good understanding of of what people
wanted what people
planning their next move and and stuff
like that you know i was definitely
aware of many things that i would have
never been aware before my poker career
so i i guess poker help you to read
people so good
um that it's like the best skill uh one
of the best kids you can have in life
all right that's that's that's very
interesting
uh okay i can't say i learned the same i
would say uh i would say that those are
definitely skills that i could still uh
further develop i can and especially
a person in your position you are i
think a very
um how do you say that you're a very
very friendly guy you give easily you're
a wealthy guy so i think also to protect
yourself against maybe your because of
your own character these skills are very
very useful because i can imagine that
especially along the ways when you
travel you meet a lot of people who have
ill intentions right when they when they
might see you like oh i can take
advantage of this guy oh this guy is
quite easily given oh he's wealthy oh i
can probably
lift along on his success you know
you're very popular as well instagram
youtube etc
actually when you speak with people bro
um
that are like even wealthy and stuff but
are not poker player many people comes
up with uh
scam stories where they get scammed by
by their wife by their uh
a divorce
or by their
partner or by the uh
they got separate with uh this person uh
this friendship ends and it was a mess
because blah blah and so many people
that are actually smart you find them
smart you know them they but they were
not a poker player in life you know they
were never a professional poker player
and i think i avoid a lot of
like i'm avoiding i i don't think i'm
getting ever almost ever scammed you
know it's it's more and more difficult
to scam me
um
i say that and one day i will get scam
big you know
whatever but like i mean it's really
more difficult than ever to scam me and
it should be easier in theory but
because i can i can feel when it's uh i
can feel the people i can feel the
person i can know what is what is
intention so i can even when it's not
obvious and it's nicely done i can spot
some stuff you know i can spot even
i like to spot that you know i like
because i travel a lot in luxury uh
hotels and stuff um
i i like to spot the strategy the
marketing strategy they have you know
like how they get teach in the
in the hotel hotel school they had
before
um what they are doing what does that
mean what they expect when they expect
the tip or whatever like when they try
to induce you for a tip um
when they they do that for a certain
reason why they do that is it's like
pure
sympathy now or it's just because
they wait for something precise at that
point i like to analyze this thing you
know it's uh it's very interesting i
asked myself question why this person
did that why did person what that person
say that you know those questions you
don't ask yourself in life when you are
not a poker player most of the time
those are not the questions you ask
yourself
but as a poker player
you ask yourself those questions way
more than other people and you can
answer them
really quick in different kind of
situation with a variety of
of answers that you can give or action
that you can do that will induce another
thing from the person
and uh and yeah
that's very very interesting
given given all your experience and you
know your your rise to the top what
would be a tip that you could give some
of our listeners who are maybe aspiring
pros or are already pros
what would be a tip you would give them
maybe one on the macro level and one on
the micro level or is
macro micro thinking actually the tip
for me actually that's a very big
takeaway for the front from this podcast
the macro
so
i would say the the the biggest micro
tip will be the
to always count
uh
their phones to always count their
bankroll to always count where
is the money that they have to split it
in the most possible places
um
and to always know
uh
how much they have and
how much they can afford to invest in
different kind of uh
games but also in different kind of
business areas or investment stuff
uh basically it's a i would say it's
it's a success tip in general it's like
always know how much you have
where is the money
make uh
counts of the different um
um stuff like accounting it's very
important to account for even if
something we don't like as uh as human
in general i think we don't like we like
to
to close our eyes you know about certain
things especially our finances
yeah i truly think it's one of the best
way to
to to
to manage uh your career and your your
wealth over the years
this is a macro tip i would say for the
micro part uh for the micro part also we
can add the coaching because getting
coached by people of every area that you
want to improve on now i'm learning
russian for example i want to learn to
speak russian i speak italian english
french
i speak a bit of german
i want to speak russian because i like
the language i listen russian raps in so
many years now i have many russian or
ukraine and friends
i definitely want to speak the language
so
i'm learning i'm taking a teacher on
zoom cones okay
uh
this seemed
logic but like many times i was saying
myself i want to learn something but you
don't take action on that you will
nothing will happen and the best way to
take action actually for the lazy people
like me and many people are lazy is to
take someone that you pay
for forcing you
to learn
so she forced me to learn at least two
hours a week so
i i don't do any homework she give me
but i do during those two hours i'm
actually learning something i have no
choice because i have to be present so
you pay for accounting again it's like a
sport coach when you pay a sport coach
it's not because it will teach you the
exercises
like everybody knows you can watch your
youtube video like it's not complicate
like it's not like poker
like
we are not speaking about becoming a
bodybuilder but if we just want to be in
shape and everything to be honest with
just youtube we can be in shape okay
and do the exercises properly but the
most difficult part is to go to the gym
and to go almost every day this is the
most difficult but how you go every day
but you go only if someone waits for you
there you cannot disappoint this person
you pay this person for being there so
you pay for accounting
so this is the tip is paying people
to account for you
so paying for accounting and accounting
yourself on your own finances you can
actually maybe pay someone to account on
your own finances but this is not what i
suggest because most of the people you
can pay for accounting for your finances
are bad accounting themselves on their
finances because people who are really
wealthy they will never
sell their services to count for you
so basically paying for someone that
will account for you it's almost not
possible so you will need to to do it
yourself except if it's like pure
accounting where someone can can go
someone that you trust can go in in all
your your different phones and and just
like
making uh resume excel sheets about it
why not but
what i
in theory you will have to do
yourself
most of the things on finance then for
micro for micro i would
always suggest to
to reanalyze uh every
hand
that you played that uh a decent size
spot
to re
speak with you with one of your coach
about those and send message write them
on the on the phone directly after
having playing them uh if you play
online just
like keep track on on on big bots on on
tracker just like not your hands uh put
them in special group uh solve them
um
just to see what was the different
sizing that you could have uh
just
um
do those
do this kind of work on on on precise
ends that are
important and
uh
in in your games like if it's
um if it's a big part in cash game but
if it's a
late game and that costs a lot of money
in terms of uh
in in tournament uh
we review it like for for people who
play tournaments uh with the whole name
resources for icm uh
uh to include the price pool and
everything
um just like
get the [ __ ] done
when you don't want to do it because you
are pain
by losing that part or by losing that
hand you don't want to think about that
anymore it's bit like the finance you
want to close your eyes and go like i
will play another tournament i would
play another
10 hour session
instead of that just do the
the hand by hand review
um yeah
yeah so basically do the stuff that you
don't want to do right don't stick your
head in the center don't try to ignore
it you're basically getting
you you you got quite good maybe in
confronting the uncomfortable you feel
uncomfortable doing it but hey it's
something that you gotta get done
yeah
any uh any any tips that you are writing
down for yourself here adam
i'm writing down loads of tips i've got
probably two pages with
i'll i'll steal the conversation in a
weird direction if i start rereading all
my notes but yeah one thing that i
really want to touch on which came up
early in the conversation was when you
compared relationships to being an asset
you said putting time into your
relationships is like an investment and
often that comes out of your short term
plan time but the long term is a huge
like win and this is a really
interesting mindset to have because i
think most poker players struggle with
this dynamic in all honesty their
relationships they don't invest time
into them because they think i'll have
success in poker first and then i'll
build these relationships after when
i've got all my money and it doesn't
work that way so for you when you
started to really invest in your
relationships because i know you talked
about around the 2016 time when you were
streaming you're very miserable you're
very unhappy when this started click for
you that wait a second i need to start
invest in my relationships
yeah this is really really really really
nicely uh
uh
nicely said what you say now it's like
exactly explain
uh you explain exactly how people uh so
many many times uh with english i
struggle to to give my my precise
opinion on stuff but because you i
understand way better of course than i
speak uh then i i i want to say like you
said it and i cannot you know but uh
okay so let's let's let's let's go from
from there but there was the time and
most of the people the poker players
have the same problem they they just
focus on making the money okay so but
the problem is you burn out so you burn
out for sure and you've gone out many
times so every time you burn out you're
gonna lose like
in cash game you're gonna lose maybe 10
buying more than what you should have
lost
no i don't speak of course in one
session i speak in
in a period um like 10 buying some pure
spew
um
like that could have been avoid totally
uh i noticed also i could lose
the same amounts of buy-ins in
tournaments that i could avoid totally
or like a big a big pay jump that i
missed or stuff like that you know or
big spew that i did in semi-final or
staffing so you will end up doing those
pew
because you are not happy so those pew
come in poker the translation of you not
being happy
will be a spew that you are never doing
before
that you never done before or you that
you do really really rarely and why you
did that at that precise moment it's
always correlated because
you were not happy in your life at that
moment
and that's among the years on 13 years i
noticed that every spew that have really
big spew
of my career i did at moments where i
was not really happy
and of course the opposite happens and
that's really really really interesting
because
i'm gonna win big
in a cash game or win big in for a month
or
win like big in tournaments when i will
be really really happy in life
so we will the receiver this is maybe
just the variance you got lucky at that
moment and unlucky at that moment yeah
there is part of it
but there is actually a lot of magic
that happens when you are very happy so
this is insane but this is definitely
the case i'm very rational guy but i can
tell you that the magic happens when you
are very happy in life when you are very
happy with the different uh
side of your life like the relation part
the healthy
body lc mine
then your pocket becomes
really strong your confidence increase
it increases your the quality of your
your your a-game your a-gaming you are
more playing your a game than ever
and
it increased then your result you can
get results that you never get before
okay
um
so actually the only way to succeed on
the long run
to not spew your bankroll at one point
because some people they can go really
deep in that you know like me i'm gonna
lose 10
and be mad at me like on the pad
like crazy you know because i will be
very harsh of myself but some people
they will lose half of their bankroll
you know or all they are bankrolling
because of of the same reasons
before making adjustments
so the only way to you will have
burnouts and you have to deal with it
you have to deal with them
but to reduce the amount of burnouts you
will have and to reduce the effects the
bad effects of the burnouts and the
money that you will lose in those
periods
you will need to create a balance that
is
the balance uh the perfect balance for
you and for diff it's different for for
many people it's different
but it always includes
relationship
uh if we are a man it includes like also
a woman sex and i guess also for a woman
includes sex also and
and uh in a relationship but like i
always speak for for men poker player
because i'm a man poker player so
it includes friendship uh friendship in
poker but friendship outside of poker is
very important that's the most difficult
to
to keep because the people are very far
from you physically
mentally
and
use your roads start to
we we we are losing um years by years a
bit more our friends outside of okay and
that's
very difficult uh
to maintain so to maintain them you need
to actually take time off
and do the travel yourself
because usually they work they have they
have obligation and you don't have that
many obligation you can just keep those
tournaments they will be scooped next
year there will be other tournaments the
fish not gonna leave
the the the the game will not gonna end
tomorrow so you can just keep that
tournament you can just keep that period
that even two months you can take off
it's no problem you have the finance to
do it you can spend money it's no big
deal to spend money because it's for
your own happiness you are spending for
yourself you are spending for
your relation so you are spending just
investing basically in it's not spending
it becomes investing in your relation
your
basically by cutting time by by forcing
the time
to be um
to be for you and your friends your
friends are working no problem
you fly
there
they have weekends you fly there on
weekends and you take hotel not far from
them
you don't disturb them to be in they are
in the house but you see them on the
weekends and you go out with them where
they go out usually you go eat you
invite them at restaurants you have more
money than them why why you should not
invite them at restaurants why you
should not pay you know
like
every girls i frequent
i'm always paying
for restaurant i'm always playing i'm
never asking to divide or
even
ex-girlfriends or stuff after one year
or something you know people start
sharing or say like we need to do 50 50
you have also money i never do that
i i did that maybe 15 years ago but it's
been like 10 years or something i never
i never do that i always
invite
just because i think
this is um better this is just better
this is just like
you should be generous you you earn as a
poker player way more money than most of
the people like why you should why you
should not be generous with that money
you will feel better
and you will also um
make the relation better in general
because you will invest for the relation
in certain ways you invest spend more
time with with the people that are in
normal life where they need to work for
for employer they they get paid really
low in term of hourly compared to what
they should be paid because sometimes
they are very smart and they they get
paid really low so yeah you invest in
the relation you're investing
in the time and this is really key if
you do that and
you forget about what you get teach as a
child because sometimes our parents have
limits in that you know they they think
uh they will teach you that you need to
keep your money that you need to to be
like like that with the money money is
very important blah blah you know they
will teach you so many things that stay
in you
if you can remove those things and and
take your own opinion about what should
be your balance that makes you pleasure
yourself and that allow you to play your
best game then
but you will play your best game then
you will have your best results that's
how i proceed
yeah
wow so so refreshing i really like that
mentality and i've almost never heard a
poker player really go
that deep on why relationships are so
important and the way you brought it
down was it almost fits into your micro
macro kind of world view so the way i
was like listening there i was thinking
like your mood is your eevee in the in
the moment which is like the micro
strategy so if you're in a negative mood
you're going to lose out in the short
term being happy but plus see the state
of mind which is going to generate more
income in the short term and then we've
got the macro which is the long term
investment in those relationships like
you said that's quite diverse we've got
poker friends we've got personal
relationships we've got outside friends
who are often the hardest right now i'm
living in bali i've been here for seven
years and i'm exactly what you said no
it's not drift from my uh outside poker
friends who are just living their lives
in london germany are in england and i
have to make a lot more effort to see
them to speak to them because they've
got stuff going on and it's on me to to
make those relationships sustainable but
i know if i do that's the macro strategy
that's long-term happiness that's
long-term fulfillment relationships
which i live for the rest of my life so
i need to take some time out my busy
schedule to connect with those people to
build that macro strategy of healthy
long-term relationships so yeah it's
really really good i think it's uh it's
things like i said most popular just do
the opposite they neglect this area so
much until they have so much pain in
their relationships they burn out so
hard because their relationships are saw
in tatters and then they go
all right well now what do i do when
they try to fix it fix it later but and
honestly it's a long-term commitment and
long-term investment in these so yeah
i'm really glad you went so deep on that
because i think a lot of players will
have to reflect on this and go uh how am
i showing up my relationships because
myself i'm thinking how am i showing up
in my relationships as a as a bipartisan
i know exactly what you said is so true
like if i'm having good relationships
i'm happy i version myself i perform
better everything i do so why am i not
taking care of that when i need to so
it's something i think a lot of players
will hopefully resonate with and take
some actions to uh to correct that so
yeah thank you for sharing that with it
that was really good no problem better
to anticipate better to anticipate also
uh than to try to fix it when it's too
late uh for example when you lose you
are like a poker player whatever you
have girlfriends many poker players like
that they have girlfriends since long
many years okay the relation end they
broke up then they try
all
their energy effort money blah blah blah
to get back their ex okay they try to
get their ex back because
why because first of all they don't have
an abundance because they they didn't
work
on
themselves as a person so they don't
attract a lot of
person around them to be honest friends
woman and everything so when they have
like
that girlfriend during so many years
they when they lose that girlfriend they
think but [ __ ] i will never have a
girlfriend again or it will take so many
years again or they so they they try and
it's not for the and the girl will
realize it's not for the good reason
that the guy coming back he's coming
back because
he has no choice like
and the girls will notice that and will
never come back to him
uh because she has choice and because
it's already he already screwed the
relation so it's already his fault
swapped
to not have the situation and i and i
had the situation before so
i made those mistakes also so
it's been many years now that i'm not
making those mistakes anymore because i
analyzed what happened why did i do
wrong and everything like same process
that i use for poker
i analyze in relation so what i did
wrong and everything
so i i pre-anticipate i anticipate i
work on the relations
all
not all the time
but all the free time that i allow me
i i try to walk a bit on the relation i
take time
it take time you know you take time
energy effort uh it's like an asset like
like we said before
friendship
relation it's for every type of family
same thing family if you avoid your
family
but you love them inside you you want to
you know that you love them you know
that you you want to see them more just
go see them more because you will and i
i say also that for myself because i
don't see them as often as i should
so
you should work on the on those
relations because dismiss this lack of
collation this lack of of what you want
truly in your earth will cause in any
case big damage in your bankroll big
damage in your career
if you don't work on it
so yeah
amazing amazing advice yeah i'm gonna
re-listen to this whole section because
this 100 applies to me right now and i
think a lot of poker players will almost
just be not putting enough time into
their relationships and like you said
it's way better to be preventative and
to invest up front in your relationships
you've almost got to do it that way
rather than waiting for the
relationships to break down and then try
to repair repair the damage and like i
said it takes consistent effort the way
you explain it there you talk about your
relationships always been on your mind
you've got free time you're investing
time into your relationships you're
taking almost like evie from your
profitable days to speak with friends to
connect with people to often fly to see
people and yeah i think we've got to
start thinking always our lives in that
way so yeah i'm definitely going to read
us another section and start to apply
these concepts also it also applies
it's also applied to cutting you can cut
relation you can cut
to create space for your life for your
mindset toxic relation people that ask
you too many things
people that you try to help stack stack
whatever
that consume your time consume your
energy that you try to coach
somehow to make them build and they
always broke and they just like
they are toxic for you
you need to cut relation you need to
just block people
use blocking buttons on whatsapp
blocking buttons on facebook it's sad
but sometimes you don't have choice
people who are too much toxic for you
you need to block them you need to
you cannot you cannot just like try
infinite time you can try a few times if
you love someone but you cannot just
keep
always people around you that are toxic
you you will become for yourself toxic
we are the sum of the five persons we we
spend the most time with so be around
people that are very
um
fulfilling you but in a good way and
also people that inspire you and also
don't be the best in the room always try
to have some better poker player with
you
you hang out with poker player because
okay being the best in the room is cool
because the people will will always
be nice to you because they know you are
like better than them they will learn
from you blah blah so they want to hang
out with you but when you are not the
best and there are some people better
than you around you
then
it's you are really considering uh
sometimes what you do you you discover
some mistake that you do and you are
evolving you're starting evolving in
those points in those moments not when
you are like the best in the room you
are starting involving where
when you are like one of the worst in
the room and that's actually what i put
myself in challenge it's really outdoor
challenge especially when you don't have
a routine
that is really um
you don't have a lot of
if you don't have a lot of discipline a
lot of
boundaries or you don't have like
relations and stuff you you can become
mad if you arrive in an atmosphere like
high rollers where people are so good uh
technically in poker and
you feel
that
you have so much to learn from them
you need to have like solid life
around solid finance solid everything if
you want to succeed because it will be
so hard oh i could stay in my comfort
zone and be like the number one french
coach number one french player blah blah
blah and just staying on my stuff and
not even trying to fight with with those
guys in ireland
but i give a try and
because i have i think i have solid
routines solid discipline i can increase
them
and i'm giving a try now and it's very
interesting and i'm learning at least
i'm learning even if i lose i'm gonna
learn for now i'm winning
let's let's see
what's gonna happen in the future
yeah great stuff so yeah i think what he
was saying there was cultivate the right
people around you almost like invest in
the right people your friends your good
relationships but the same time cut out
the toxic people because you haven't got
the the time the energy the bandwidth to
uh have that many people around you so
pick your circle wisely also have people
around you who are better than you and
what you do who inspire you who you look
up to so you're learning from almost
like if you're the average of the five
people around you you want two two above
one on your level two below and that
kind of yeah
i think it's a good balance yeah when
you are four above you it's a it's
because it starts becoming a problem
also but most of the time people do the
mistake to have four people under under
them because it's way more comfortable
um
yeah it's it's a good balance what you
say two two and one uh same well one
thing can be your best friend can be
somehow like one of your best friend two
that you get inspired that are like your
mentors kind of plus they need to be
your friends if you want to hang out
with them or you need to pay them to
hang out a lot with them like pay them
at uh hourly coaching to not to hang out
but just to learn from them as coaching
it's also time
even if it's time paid it's it's still
uh it still comes uh if you have a lot
of coaching with them then it's still a
lot of time uh and two above you
under you sorry can be like
just slightly under you not maybe too
much under you maybe one is like one one
of the guy you coach and you help
accomplishing maybe not too many of them
because if you have too many of them
then you
you you start dedicating too much time
to coaching and and you cannot improve
as much
uh like that but one is it's it's decent
and one other can be just another friend
that is just less successful and
whatever
it is it's just one other good friend
you can relate with can be also your
partner one girl whatever um that sounds
like a decent uh
decent scenario um
yeah thinking about more
yeah thinking about our relationship
like an asset this is key
um yeah and definitely this will help
your game to be well better and your
burnouts will be
less
cost
they will cost less your burnouts will
cost
way less and you would have gone out no
matter what
in poker
love it i love this advice i really feel
like it's a an angle i didn't expect
this conversation to go down and i think
it's just such a powerful
model for people to listen to and really
reflect on their relationships and how
they're showing up in them and i think
it all links back to like the way you're
you show up in life is the same way you
show up in your relationships like you
were talking earlier about bringing the
fun to poker games it's your
responsibility to be the enjoyment for
the room it's the same with your
relationships it's your responsibility
to show up to be the fun person to be
the good friend in those dynamics and it
doesn't often come easy and often we
have to invest time and energy into
those things and yeah i think like we
talked about earlier often poker players
do the opposite they just go
relationships go that way i'm gonna be
successful make lots of money and then
i'll figure it out so yeah i really feel
like to be more balanced person like you
said less burnouts to be a higher
performer
combining the two having good
relationships with a successful career
is the model almost everyone wants so we
need to be thinking about that and
cultivating it during the journey not at
the end so yeah amazing stuff yeah i
think we could go forever and this kind
of thing is so so powerful
all right ready have you any final
questions any other things that have
come up yet
no i think uh
i think we've asked everything we wanted
to ask is there something that you still
want to share your one to our listeners
something that you still want to say
that we haven't brought up
no i think we covered uh all the
subjects uh yeah the
the the
again the key uh for me uh
it's always about
mental stuff and how you
you organize your whole life the macro
the mental stuff and just start to
estimate those things
as much as you estimate working on
on the micro which is
whatever solvers and and other like
coaching analyze stuff that you that you
do just start evaluating your the macro
as something way more
like at least as important as the micro
but way more people do the opposite they
they will they will work a lot on their
micro but they have poor
poor macro and end up to be also pro
life
and
unsatisfied frustrated
because also they don't ask themselves
those questions too much and they
realize when it's too late
that when it's too late when it's late
that they are not happy
and that it's not key and in any case
all the effort that you're gonna do in
micro that will make you more wealthy
more rich more blah blah blah will be
will be lost
because you will not be happy and
because your macro will make you burn
out your macro is so bad that you will
burn out in any case and lose
somehow because
in poker we we are playing with our
money so we are also playing when
when we are not happy when we are not in
good condition so
it can be really dangerous can be really
dangerous for any
point of your career so
it's also
not for myself i will you can go crazy
and start playing all the rollers
playing 250k re-buying blah blah blah
blah blah you can go broke like there is
no point where
someone cannot go broke in poker like
the only moment where you cannot go
broke anymore in poker is when you are a
billionaire
and even if you are a billionaire to be
honest there are some games where you
could
you could lose a lot you can lose a lot
especially if you are like way behind
the the average level of the game
um so
yeah let's say that
you can lose a lot but you will never
like make yourself in danger when you
are a billionaire but i think no one of
us is billionaire
not a lot of people that listen this
podcast now are billionaires and maybe
one day someone will be and i hope
someone that listen that will be and
just come to me and say okay i liked
what you said then you know i did that
that and that and i'm like
way more rich and new now and whatever
and i'm i will be like wow this is
insane and i will try to learn from what
i didn't
um get
that he got that i didn't get you know i
would try to always understand what what
someone got that i didn't get
um
yeah
because we can be smart in some areas
and completely dumb in other i'm very
dumb in many areas
so
it's important to realize that it's good
it's good self-awareness
yeah super important because you cannot
involve if you think you are the
smartest in the room in all areas like
you're just gonna
you're just gonna stay the same and even
regress yeah i mean you you talked about
you know yeah you can keep on firing
this 250 case you are currently in the
high roller scene right taking some
shots there uh what is the biggest
threat for you
then in terms of you said everyone can
broke anyone can go broke what would be
the biggest threat for you
and going broke
the biggest threat no i will
i never put myself in in danger so i
will i'm not threatened by anything i
just i just
i just always keep reminding myself that
we
[Music]
need to take uh
decisions that are always
part of a
macro
organization like bankroll management is
key for poker shorting is not
a way i don't shot actually it's like
part of my bankroll management i'm not
shouting those things uh i'm just
know that i'm giving uh tries and i also
know uh also being okay my biggest
threat will be like thinking maybe that
i'm
too good compared to what i'm actually i
am actually so and also thinking that
i'm too bad compared to what i am so the
most difficult is to evaluate our own
level compared to other people because
of the big variance that there is in
life
so the the
the most difficult is to not think that
you are too good compared to the other
people
so to underestimate them and thinking
you are very ready to over them or the
opposite if you think you are too bad
compared to 10 then you're going to play
bad also because you you won't even
enter probably
yeah so you need to think try to
yeah try to become better but also think
uh the most objective possible about
your level which is very difficult in
life games it's more easy online
so maybe one of the keys is to continue
to play online
one of the keys maybe to continue to
play online but i would not be willing
to do so
um to be honest not uh it's not
fulfilled me
enough uh i also think there is
cheating going on and not everywhere but
i think there is
um so i i don't i don't definitely don't
want to
to be part of it anymore uh the games
are also quite low right for your
standards now
what do you mean the game the games the
games are quite low now online
you can play super big bro you can play
uh
you can play like session on sundays uh
like tournaments guys they play a 200k
session on sundays they have like
spending 200k
so it's uh if they if they make zero in
the money they lose 200k
yeah okay that's not long you can play
quite big nowadays uh because there is
bunch of errors rebuys and also in cash
game if you manage to go
united states you can like there is some
some games if you manage to battle with
some wrecks then you can you can start
some games online that are like
100 200 even more some people had one
million on the table uh recently but
yeah
yeah i know the guy uh but yeah so so so
so this is not in your career path we
won't see you uh we won't see you at
those games definitely not and it took
me time to accept that because i i
always wanted to do both but one day i
just i said like i'm not having fun
anymore i'm not having like uh
um it's not social like
it's not the the poker that i want to
play anymore you know i played all the
years i also think it's way more
difficult than before it doesn't think
it's impossible at all because like so
many people are making good money online
so many good players but i also think
it's both more difficult plus less fun
for someone that gets older i think i'm
33 now i'm more like a lifestyle and i
always love live remember i start with
live i didn't start with online i'm i'm
someone that is social online is the
opposite of my
character so
but one of the key probably uh for the
thing i said before is to keep playing
online because
uh you can realize your
uh you can know better what is your
level what is your poker level yeah
and you can be a bit less lost when
you're gonna choose your live games you
know which is more difficult for me
nowadays because i cannot see exactly
where i am in the field
um
many times in many games
but i keep giving tries you know i i
prefer to to give tries i always not
take i'm not taking big risk so there is
no big threat but if i have to say a
bigger threat that's what i would have
say is to not be able to judicate my own
level compared to the field that would
be my biggest threat and your and your
management and your self-awareness is
way greater than your ego because i
would say an ego is often a very big
threat right in poker
yeah oh i guess it was my biggest threat
at the beginning that one but uh then
yeah of course i worked on it with uh
with 12 years of poker you cannot have
like too much ego i have ego but
yeah yeah like you remove it like you
you remove it on many situations and
stuff
all right well i want to thank you a lot
johan for sharing a lot of wisdom uh
and i want to wish you a lot of luck
you're heading over to uh ept monte
carlo
tomorrow yeah
busy schedule there
busy schedule yeah yeah i might play the
100k euro on sunday yeah
so three days event yeah
oh i wish you a lot of luck you're in a
good state right you've you've
socialized relationship are good happy
you're feeling excited i see a lot of
good things going to happen for you in
monte carlo what about you adam
i do i think the macro strategies spot
on the micro is going in there strong as
well and yeah you put yourself in a good
position to have a good 10 days i win
something big in monte carlo guys i will
uh i will say something in the story for
you guys for sharing the
the goodbye goodbye positivity
yeah yeah amazing i will definitely
think about those conversations this was
a great conversation okay i liked it
yesterday all right thank you
to have those conversations with smart
people because when you have those
conversations
you also uh
you you anchor in yourself the concepts
because it's easy to have the concept
it's another thing to apply them so when
you anchor them the more you anchor them
the more you apply them because you
cannot just speak for nothing so you
just like speak speak speak speak speak
but as
as much as you repeat the things and the
concept
you you you apply them more you apply
them more in consciously consciously and
everything so
very important that we repeat the
concepts
some concepts we know already some
concepts come from when you associate
people that have different
that are smart that are different uh way
to sing then you it creates another
concept that we didn't
got before just because of exchanging
you know and i think in this
conversation there was some concept that
that were born that that got born
because we we we ask ourselves different
questions
you me and and
like all three like this you know as a
ping pong another wisdom bomb dropped in
the mechanics of poker podcast
right adam
yes that was an amazing episode probably
our most charismatic guest to date and
yeah just
knowledge bomb after knowledge bomb my
i've run out of paper i literally ran
out of paper for my no ticking so i have
to uh uh reflect on the main points i
got from it see i think one of the
themes that was going throughout the
conversation which we didn't go into in
depth was his level of self-awareness
and his intuition as well he's very
aware of his current skill level his
faults his ego even in his career he
realized that was an issue and he seems
like someone who's very in tune with his
intuition he's very in tune with his
environment i think he said the biggest
life lesson he learned from poca overall
was his ability to read people not just
poker players but people anyone in
circles that requires a lot of intuition
a lot of feel for your environment a lot
of emotional regulation skills but yeah
emotional challenges as well to do that
yeah that's a real high level skill that
he's been able to develop one of the
biggest things i took with this
conversation was
treating your relationships as an asset
and use this concept of micro and macro
throughout it there's many examples
micro being the kind of in in like in
the weeds strategy like the the short
term where the macros can the bigger
picture i think that really matters in
the long term and he talked about his
relationship design basically how he
invests in those as an investment
because his long term like the macro
strategy of being happy is one of the
most important things to him and that
translates to him being a good poker
player performing well and then the
micro of that is his mood equals ev so
to speak you didn't use that terminology
where he comparing when he's a negative
frame of mind he loses money or he
doesn't play his best when he's feeling
good and feel happy he plays his best
poker and he's always thinking big
picture he's someone who uh i think i
mentioned this through the podcast he's
almost like a chess player which he was
when he was younger and he's navigating
his life circumstances and trying to
optimize for happiness trying to
optimize for the bigger picture and yeah
i think the way he was talking about
putting time into your relationships
that was his personal relationships his
poker friends and in particular is
outside the poker friends he took a bit
of time explaining why it's so important
as poker players to really reach out to
our friends outside of poca and really
nurture those relationships and then
going away from this conversation i'm
literally going to message a few friends
because i feel like i've been neglecting
this part of my life and i'm really big
on his macro strategy of relationships
equal happiness equals a good life so
yeah there's so many concepts that we
need to delve deep into and yeah very
very impressed with his ability to uh
share knowledge share with them and yeah
he's picked up a lot of skills and
hopefully the way he was really in the
points would resonate with our audience
as much as with me because i think i'm
going to go away from this and jail and
reflect because yeah very very yeah
in-depth knowledge that he had there so
yeah what were some of your main
takeaways running any concepts that
stuck with you
yeah and especially i felt like this
podcast was really different than the
other ones there was a lot of different
angles being
you know called that in the previous
podcast we haven't heard guests talk
about
in this way right normally there's sort
of a trend and the podcast sort of kind
of you know they're the same type of
players uh but john definitely brought
something new to the table so i think
that's that's very nice and indeed the
whole macro micro concept that kept on
coming back i loved the thing where he
said yeah you can focus on the micro and
play well on the live on the live table
you have a good hourly but if they don't
like to play with you if you're not
entertaining
the macro is that you can play a lot of
hours if you only focus on the micro you
can maybe play two hours and the game
dies but the macro is your job is to
keep that game alive so you can realize
your hourly so i thought that was uh
that was really interesting i played he
has a he has a game here and i got
invited to that game a couple times and
this was actually he also said this is
something you do well uh because i go
into the game thing like okay yeah uh
i want to i want to have a good time
when i go play live i want to have a
good time and i'm sure also they won't
have a good time and they if they like
to play with me and i like to play with
them we can play again right i thought
about in the macro level as well
um
i also thought it was in the interesting
way just said be happy basically
because of that he plays his a game more
often and you know
i think everyone listening if you play
your a game you're a good winning player
right so if i think he finds ways around
the macro in order to play his a game
more frequently uh i also thought it was
interesting that
a big tell when he's not happy is that
he spews it's almost like a
self-sabotage like your body is saying
okay [ __ ] this i'm gonna spew it off
right now because i don't do not want to
be here okay it's just just a clear
warning sign so i thought that was very
valuable as well and i mean we can go on
and on and on that's why we talked for
what two and a half hours or something
with john so i want to thank him again
and i want to thank everyone for tuning
in
to another great podcast we actually are
going to record another podcast tomorrow
