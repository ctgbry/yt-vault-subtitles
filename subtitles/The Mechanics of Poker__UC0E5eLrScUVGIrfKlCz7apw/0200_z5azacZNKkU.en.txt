to begin with? So the lines that people

[02:15]
to begin with? So the lines that people

[02:15]
to begin with? So the lines that people
are playing the be that people play the

[02:18]
are playing the be that people play the

[02:18]
are playing the be that people play the
best are the most common lines. Let's

[02:20]
best are the most common lines. Let's

[02:20]
best are the most common lines. Let's
say CBAT, big blind versus the button or

say CBAT, big blind versus the button or
defense against CBT. It's hard to make a

there are some spots that you don't get

[02:33]
there are some spots that you don't get

there are some spots that you don't get
to play a lot. For example, small blind

[02:34]
to play a lot. For example, small blind

[02:34]
to play a lot. For example, small blind
versus big blind three but pot when the

[02:37]
versus big blind three but pot when the

[02:37]
versus big blind three but pot when the
big blind checks flop and then small

[02:39]
big blind checks flop and then small

[02:40]
big blind checks flop and then small
blind has to act or even big blind

[02:42]

has to split his sizes. And there are
many ways to make potential mistakes. So

[02:59]
many ways to make potential mistakes. So

[02:59]
many ways to make potential mistakes. So
those are some ideas to start with.

[03:01]
those are some ideas to start with.

[03:01]
those are some ideas to start with.
Also, it's important while searching for
