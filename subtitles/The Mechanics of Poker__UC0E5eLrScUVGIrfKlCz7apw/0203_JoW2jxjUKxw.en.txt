pot with llo llo great to have you on
the pop
man hey it's great to be here thank you
for inviting me no worries no worries
you playing poker for 15 years and have

[05:31]
you playing poker for 15 years and have
acquired big success in both cash MTT
live and
online when Googling you not much came
up besides like a demol zerian like
Instagram account was this lifestyle one
of the motivators for you to pursue a

[05:46]
of the motivators for you to pursue a
career in poker but yeah like Mo mostly
what motivated me is just the just the
lifestyle you can you can travel and uh
and play tournaments

[06:00]
and play tournaments
and it's just be your own bus do
everything in your schedule like I I
always hated to have to wake up for
something which I don't like to do but

[06:15]
something which I don't like to do but
if I had to wake up something I I really
was I was really looking forward to that
was that was amazing so uh I I started
with poker at the University basically
and and uh yeah it it was a such a great

[06:33]
and and uh yeah it it was a such a great
opportunity when I realized I I could do
this for a living and just be free
travel around the
world oh you definitely done your fair
share of traveling did you have any like

[06:45]
share of traveling did you have any like
Role Models because straight away you
saw poker as like an opportunity to
provide a certain lifestyle that
attracted to you did you have any like
role models that you could see like hey
I want to be like that
guy uh yeah I I definitely had many role

[07:01]
guy uh yeah I I definitely had many role
models in the during my care career but
um in the
beginning uh I basically only saw like
live live Pros like live famous players
like Daniel nanu and phield helmet and

[07:16]
like Daniel nanu and phield helmet and
stuff like high stakes
poker uh and it was hard to relate to
them because that was so much different
but the I basically I started my online
Journey on on poker strategy.com where

[07:31]
Journey on on poker strategy.com where
you could get this
$50 stuff and there were like free
coachings uh where you could you know
you just join to a coaching and like 15
people and there was this guy Raley 25

[07:47]
people and there was this guy Raley 25
who was already playing I think mostly p
and I I I just joined to a class of his
to just ask him like is this real like
you can you can get money like it it

[08:00]
you can you can get money like it it
felt such a gambling to me and and that
was my first promise that okay I don't
want to lose any any money so only the
maximum I do is I I put zero money in it
but if I can get like $50 for free and I

[08:17]
but if I can get like $50 for free and I
can build something out of it uh then I
do it so I I asked this rale guy like is
it is it like you can live like you
you're doing only this and like you

[08:30]
you're doing only this and like you
travel and and stuff stuff and he's like
yeah yeah yeah you can do it and and he
was very very friendly very nice guy so
actually helped me uh so he he um he
basically convinced me that you can you

[08:45]
basically convinced me that you can you
can do this as a living and and give me
confidence but the twist of the story is
this guy um uh went broke pretty quickly
and then like he he he owned people

[09:00]
and then like he he he owned people
money he owned me money and uh
fortunately he pay me but after that I
heard like many people didn't get paid
and he just disappeared I never heard
anything about him anymore but yeah it

[09:16]
anything about him anymore but yeah it
it helped me a little bit so I guess I
guess so I guess it was first first it
was kind of the role model like okay
well you could actually do this and then
I guess he became a role model example
of like there's also a downside to to
Poker so maybe we should you know try

[09:30]
Poker so maybe we should you know try
try to get this our [ __ ] together yeah
yeah yeah so I I just der so much in the
story but the yet the real role model
stuff is
like at the beginning I I didn't have

[09:46]
like at the beginning I I didn't have
like very um like exact role model in
that stuff in that uh view but after
yeah obviously
like OTB Red Bar I mean much much later

[10:01]
like OTB Red Bar I mean much much later
it it was also a different kind of R mod
because you couldn't see anything about
him like no no pictures no interviews
like this no uh I mean he had that two
plus two um threat right where he's like
I'm going to refocus on 500L Zoom I

[10:17]
I'm going to refocus on 500L Zoom I
think that was uh definitely I remember
I was reading that threat and there was
definitely a big role model say
motivator and then you saw him basically
Crush 500 n Zoom move up and suddenly he
was playing heads up against Fish Cat
all those guys you know who were who

[10:31]
all those guys you know who were who
were at the top of that point uh and he
was basically crushing them so that was
it was motivating because like through a
threat on two plus two you can really
hear the story also like behind the
scenes right whereas maybe like Den n
granu and uh all these guys on like high

[10:46]
granu and uh all these guys on like high
six poker you only see like a moment of
Studio you know it's like a moment of
Glamour yeah and uh and also it was such
a weird feeling to me that basically

[11:00]
a weird feeling to me that basically
yeah my role models were definitely
these live famous players and when you
are a couple years into your career and
and you realize that oh actually some of
these guys are not even good anymore
like even playing like fish and it was

[11:17]
like even playing like fish and it was
just such a weird feeling I I remember I
couldn't even admit to myself like I had
to wait and meet with a very very good
player and ask him like I mean do you do

[11:32]
player and ask him like I mean do you do
you really think this and that famous
guy it's not even a good player and it's
like yeah yeah it's fish so it it it was
also like I remember do you guys
remember if uh you guys had

[11:46]
remember if uh you guys had
a like before Facebook there was so many
different kind of uh platforms and I
remember I I had like a
Hungarian uh social media something and

[12:01]
Hungarian uh social media something and
I had the picture of Daniel nanu like
biggest thr mod there and I I the
caption was like he can turn your brain
into [ __ ] because he had these famous
videos like when he when he reads people

[12:15]
videos like when he when he reads people
like the exact
card and uh and I really wanted to be
like him and I remember I was very very
annoying uh playing live because I was
always talking like you know these guys
who
are in the pot and you're like oh you

[12:32]
are in the pot and you're like oh you
must have Ace King I think you have Ace
King and and people like oh just shut up
and play we don't we don't care about
that and yeah if D on the ground who
does it it's it's fun you know but when
Loa does it it's like oh there's this
annoying Hungarian guy that cannot shut

[12:46]
annoying Hungarian guy that cannot shut
up yeah and then later you go to a
different place like Patrick Antonio's
face where you don't talk at all like no
words during a hand uh you just don't
say anything thing so I have these

[13:01]
say anything thing so I have these
faces and uh yeah you I I love them you
did did did you stra right knew that
poker was a skill game because I can
imagine like you asked this guy right is
this real did you think it was more of a

[13:15]
this real did you think it was more of a
gambling game or when was like the first
time that you realized oh wait there's
actually quite a lot of skill in poker
maybe you developed like some sort of
strategy you were like oh wait this is
actually
winning yeah so actually I started a a
little bit earlier playing live because

[13:31]
little bit earlier playing live because
we had this huge poker boom uh in
Hungary too and all of my friends were
like playing poker and they were like
okay let's let's do a home game for like
500 Hungarian foreign entry which was

[13:46]
500 Hungarian foreign entry which was
like
$2 and we played on a ping pong table in
a basement or
something and it felt like gambling like
I lost 500 for and two two bucks and I

[14:02]
I lost 500 for and two two bucks and I
was like oh geez I'm not sure I should
do this like we usually just get
together play something and you don't
lose money so it felt like gambling but
very soon I discovered the books of Dan

[14:17]
very soon I discovered the books of Dan
Harrington uh like tournament play stuff
and obviously it was pretty clear to me
that there is some
strategic uh stuff you can you can um

[14:31]
strategic uh stuff you can you can um
improve a lot we also had many many
misconceptions like I I remember a funny
story we were playing like
a$3
cango and and I I bet on the

[14:47]
cango and and I I bet on the
river whatever and my friend very
quickly calls there was a flush possible
on the board and I'm like I was bluffing
he called me I'm like how how did you
know I don't have a I don't have a flush

[15:01]
know I don't have a I don't have a flush
he's like yeah cuz last hand you had a
flush and it's impossible to have flush
two times in a row just so little chance
that you cannot have a
flush uh so like stuff like this and and

[15:15]
flush uh so like stuff like this and and
I remember this and I like yeah okay
okay I have to keep in mind but yeah
then you you quickly realize that
independent um chances
so yeah so so so we played a lot of like

[15:30]
so yeah so so so we played a lot of like
these games and started to read some
books and and that was more than enough
to beat my friends they didn't read any
books so yeah that's it sounds very
similar to my story like you start to
you start to read them book and then

[15:45]
you start to read them book and then
your friends are like oh yeah did did
the book tell you to do that you know
especially if you lose it's like oh yeah
great book I would read more books if I
was you stuff like that so you
definitely open yourself up to getting
needled exactly I was Wonder have you
been like competitive in other sports or
games before you started playing

[16:02]
games before you started playing
poker yeah um
somewhat I I wasn't really professional
I was just probably dreaming about it so
the first thing I was playing um

[16:15]
the first thing I was playing um
competitively is was this was the Quake
tree
Arena if you guys familiar with it yeah
for sure shooter game right yeah
so uh we didn't really have internet
connection we had like

[16:31]
connection we had like
56k modem something which was really
really slow and really expensive so
basically I was just uh playing uh
against bots like you know that was The

[16:46]
against bots like you know that was The
Nightmare uh hardest possible bot you
can play and I I was practicing all day
every day I I read about the you can you
can go a tournament and then qualify to
the the wor cyber games in in Korea

[17:01]
the the wor cyber games in in Korea
South Korea that was the big dream like
15 years old you can win like
$10,000 so I was practicing and playing
every day all day like no strategy
nothing just just play and I managed to

[17:17]
nothing just just play and I managed to
beat these Bots like 50 like cannot be
better than that to to beat these Bots
and I remember I went for the first like
uh tour amateur tournament in in a very

[17:32]
uh tour amateur tournament in in a very
close Village and I played my first
match and I got lost like minus one to
40 minus one you get when you even kill
yourself accidentally so I was

[17:46]
yourself accidentally so I was
completely destroyed and I quickly
realized that okay humans play much
different than than Bots and you cannot
just play the same as you play against
bots so I
uh yeah we we did a couple of years of

[18:02]
uh yeah we we did a couple of years of
that and I competed the the Hungarian
qualifier for the world cyber games but
I didn't have like any success I
probably I won one match and and lost
the the other uh very badly uh but yeah

[18:19]
the the other uh very badly uh but yeah
played a couple years and and I was
hopeful but then World Cup 3 came out
and I switched to that and by then we
had had good internet connection and

[18:31]
had had good internet connection and
everything and there was battl net you
can practice every day online so that
was much better we still didn't have any
strategic like we we didn't know how to
do strategic stuff I I remember like

[18:48]
do strategic stuff I I remember like
very Basics I in Back to the quick tree
Arena if if you kill someone there is a
there are respawning spots where he
could respawn and obviously we get like

[19:00]
could respawn and obviously we get like
replays from the best players and we
were watching the best replays and you
can remember like where could they spawn
and like when you kill them straight
away go for a spawn spot and if you are
lucky you can get a another kill so like

[19:16]
lucky you can get a another kill so like
very very basic stuff and Warcraft 3
also like super basic stuff but nothing
fancy and yeah I did that a couple years
too and um I had better success in that

[19:30]
too and um I had better success in that
so we had a
tournament um near to my to my home
Village and uh I I won the one versus
one competition and I was a friend of
mine best friend uh playing two two

[19:48]
mine best friend uh playing two two
versus two as well and we won that too
so it was like best feeling ever I
remember I had a I I didn't do diary but
on that day I had to write it down to a

[20:01]
on that day I had to write it down to a
txt file I hope I find it some some
somewhere sometime uh I was like
happiest guy in the world like 16 17
years old and I went home to my mom and
show like yeah I just won like 300 bucks

[20:17]
show like yeah I just won like 300 bucks
uh in Hungarian for it and he was like
she was like what like
really playing playing playing video
games right where video games were quite
new especially to a generation like your
mother you know like wait you made money
of video

[20:31]
of video
games yeah it was so much fun so then
also the the world cyber games qualifier
came and um I finished like fifth I
think so it was pretty good result but

[20:47]
think so it was pretty good result but
only the first got to to the South
Korea uh
area uh but that was actually a really
really funny story
um so there was this guy called

[21:03]
um so there was this guy called
warbringer or something that was the
Hungarian guy who who beat everyone like
I had no chance so it wasn't even close
um he was the best for sure and then he

[21:15]
um he was the best for sure and then he
he qualified to South Korea and he got
that there on the in in Korea there was
like brackets like groups four uh people
four four people groups and the first
two goes forward and then like it's a

[21:32]
two goes forward and then like it's a
it's a three and uh he got like the
sickest uh group so there was like gry
I'm sure heard of him like it's a big
twitch Channel he's still playing World

[21:45]
twitch Channel he's still playing World
Cup 3 it's a Dutch guy actually Dutch
guy too oh W and U it's he he was 4K te
4K groupy he's a very fun guy love his
videos he was one of the best at the

[22:00]
videos he was one of the best at the
time and there was one more guy I can't
remember like top three or something and
there was one guy like nobody knew and
he was from Ethiopia like what and there
was the Hungarian guy so he lost both

[22:16]
was the Hungarian guy so he lost both
matches to the to the top ones so
obviously not going forward and then he
plays the the Ethiopian guy and he's
like Max Focus like build building the
base getting the hero

[22:31]
base getting the hero
like everything on point everything is
calculated and then he gets to the to
the guy's base and the guy doesn't even
know what to do like didn't even have a
hero like building building different
buildings that he needs like clearly it

[22:47]
buildings that he needs like clearly it
doesn't even know the rules and turned
out that the guy was actually playing
common and concus Generals and made to
the South Korea qualifier but they last
minute cancel the CNC General so no no

[23:02]
minute cancel the CNC General so no no
General but he already had like the SL
like I'll play Warcraft instead and then
they said okay let's let's put in
Warcraft 3 yeah it's it's it's like it's
like sitting me down like oh I came here

[23:15]
like sitting me down like oh I came here
to play ANM cash game sorry there's only
a r
tournament all right I'll H in there no
problem I mean nobody understood this
but it was funny because basically any
Hungary player who

[23:30]
Hungary player who
would get the South Korean seat would
have the same result because losing to
the two best and then winning to the
Ethiopian maybe even my mother would
have the same result would would be
probably a close draw with the utopian

[23:46]
probably a close draw with the utopian
guy um yeah what is it I mean Poker also
obviously very competitive environment
esport especially nowadays and
especially in Korea I mean Korea they
get very competitive when it comes down
to Esports what is it that you like
about

[24:02]
competing H it's an interesting question
because I always thought um I became
competitive because of these games in my
childhood and I became like this in

[24:16]
childhood and I became like this in
poker because of that but if if I think
about it more deeply I was that at day
day one so when I started playing quick
three Arena I was like okay I I want to

[24:31]
three Arena I was like okay I I want to
be the best I want to earn money with
this so it's hard to say I think it's
it's probably something like genetics
because I can't even remember anything
would trigger that and I had other

[24:46]
would trigger that and I had other
friends doing the same but they were not
as motivated as me definitely they were
very smart and and uh good at it but

[25:00]
very smart and and uh good at it but
they were not that
motivated um so so not sure
but obviously later in in poker it was
much easier because it was like
a um a straight answer to your problems

[25:17]
a um a straight answer to your problems
like what do you mean with that straight
answer to your problems like like if if
you would like
to in that time being an esport
professional it was like a fuzzy Dream

[25:31]
professional it was like a fuzzy Dream
It's not sure you can do anything or
even if you're the best maybe not
earning that much money but but but
later in in the University where you had
like poker and like huge uh stories

[25:46]
like poker and like huge uh stories
successful stories winning millions and
traveling a lot that was like a obvious
answer that yeah I could I could
definitely choose that over my so I was
learning programming and Mathematics in

[26:00]
learning programming and Mathematics in
the university and it was my second year
when I got into poker and uh it was
couple months later I was I was 100%
sure I'm going to do this instead of
the the profession I would have there

[26:18]
the the profession I would have there
you did the math and you were like math
checks out poker poker career is is the
way forward yeah you you also mentioned
that it's both a strength and a weakness
of yours that you can get easily hooked
on something and when you really like

[26:30]
on something and when you really like
something right you go and go all in is
that kind of then linked to like that
competitive competitive nature like if
you're G to do something you know you
jump in fully so exactly yeah I think uh
definitely it's it's the

[26:45]
definitely it's it's the
same um I have a couple examples to that
I I have so it's I I think it's it's um
it's um gift
that I'm very interested and motivated

[27:01]
that I'm very interested and motivated
in stuff and and I can get into deep and
quickly but after a while it could hurt
for other areas of your life and um so I

[27:17]
for other areas of your life and um so I
can give you a recent
example like four or five years ago I
started playing the piano and I took
coachings from from a a guy
and I he told me that I need to learn uh

[27:33]
and I he told me that I need to learn uh
music theory for sure if I want to be
good and I started learning music theory
I loved it I even can see similarities
in poker and so it it was fun and

[27:46]
in poker and so it it was fun and
definitely help with the music as well
and now I have problems like I grind I
have to focus on the grind and I put on
some music just just some background
music and I start thinking oh this this

[28:01]
music and I start thinking oh this this
song would be so nice in a piano version
Let Me Google if there is a piano
version and is there a music sheet I
could learn and then I derailed from my
session and like completely

[28:15]
session and like completely
lost um so yeah these Stuffs the these
stuff definitely makes it harder to
focus on one
thing I mean I I I get that I would say
I'm very similar when you start dividing

[28:30]
I'm very similar when you start dividing
things also it's not as satisfying
because you you know you know you could
do better if you would put all your time
in it and that's way more satisfying so
yeah juggling multiple things at the
same time can definitely relate it
doesn't give the same amount of
satisfaction you mentioned that there

[28:45]
satisfaction you mentioned that there
were similarities in in poker Theory and
in music theory and I guess also similar
or I guess it's a skill that kind of the
art of learning is kind of a skill right
I I remember
book I think Lally called art of

[29:00]
book I think Lally called art of
learning Josh wein if I'm not mistaken
like a chess Prodigy he was if I'm not
mistaken in the past and he mentioned
that like if you learn a skill and if
you learn how to learn you can then use
that knowledge to learn other skills
have you so I'm curious first for the

[29:16]
have you so I'm curious first for the
for the similarities between music
theory and poker Theory and then I'm
curious like what did you learn about
learning itself that made it maybe also
uh easier for you to start building
other skills on current

[29:32]
skills yeah I I definitely agree with
you and and even if you just look at
poker it's there are multiple stuff you
can juggle with like you can learn MTT
you can learn heads up you can learn PLO

[29:47]
you can learn heads up you can learn PLO
so even if you try to play multiple
poker stuff you still dividing your time
and and you don't have that much time
into one thing you should focus

[30:00]
into one thing you should focus
probably um so yeah it's definitely the
the learning
process
um I I
think
um I I'm really good at managing um

[30:18]
um I I'm really good at managing um
information and and searching for
information and uh I think I can quickly
find out if it's useful or like not very

[30:30]
find out if it's useful or like not very
useful or or like basically maybe even
[ __ ]
um and um so actually with the piano I
started with an
application uh which was like you you

[30:48]
application uh which was like you you
play on the keyboard and and it shows a
sheet and if you hit the right key it
recognize the key and and uh moves you
for forward so it was like key flow or

[31:00]
for forward so it was like key flow or
something something like that and I it
didn't feel feel very good because you
learned what you should press but you
didn't learn anything about the hand
movement or or anything like that so I

[31:15]
movement or or anything like that so I
went I remember I went to the piano
teacher and I was like yeah I already
learned a song by myself uh can I
present it to you and after 10 seconds
she was was okay stop this this is

[31:30]
she was was okay stop this this is
really bad
and and then she started correcting the
stuff I did wrong uh but she was
actually a terrible teacher she was like
a like a Russian teacher from 1980s like

[31:52]
a like a Russian teacher from 1980s like
the nice yeah exactly so you couldn't
even understand the the exercise but she
was like do it do it do it faster what

[32:00]
was like do it do it do it faster what
why why don't you do it like don't stop
so it's like super high pressure I
didn't like it at all and then I
switched and met with this guy from from
a from he his he in University uh

[32:16]
a from he his he in University uh
learning music and he he was really
really good and basically thought me the
basics the right Right Stuff how to do
it
so I'm not always

[32:30]
so I'm not always
uh into the you should get a coach like
straight
away but in this area
definitely obviously it's
so so skill or or like mechanics

[32:47]
so so skill or or like mechanics
dependent like how to use your your
fingers and stuff so it definitely
needed a coach for that but maybe I'm
not sure maybe if you go to the gym you
don't have to get a coach first but

[33:01]
don't have to get a coach first but
maybe it's not to either so yeah get a
coach first yeah I would I would say
getting a coach first in whatever you do
is probably best I think it like it
speeds up the learning curve so so fast
even if like something simple as going

[33:15]
even if like something simple as going
to the gym if you've been doing the
wrong exercise for one year yeah it
could be where someone in the beginning
could have immediately explained you the
correct exercise then you probably you
know you get way more out of the time
that you put into the gym for example
you mentioned
about like it being a skill to find the

[33:32]
about like it being a skill to find the
correct information how does one filter
like what are signs that I think you
said that this information is [ __ ]
because especially in poker nowadays
there's a lot of information out there
so how do we filter for good information

[33:45]
so how do we filter for good information
what are like the signs of like this is
actually
[ __ ] for
sure
um so I think the basic is just search a
lot of information and you're going to

[34:00]
lot of information and you're going to
come across the same again and
usually it's uh it's working and
um and you realize that that's what

[34:15]
um and you realize that that's what
other coaches said as well and maybe
yeah in poker it could be could be still
wrong for sure but um that's that's one
thing other thing is
it's really weird when I remember I

[34:33]
it's really weird when I remember I
wanted to get
some coaching pack on on singing how to
learn to sing and there was this
guy uh he had an advertisement I really

[34:45]
guy uh he had an advertisement I really
liked it it was so good uh perfectly
what I needed wasn't expensive so I was
like okay let's go just buy and when I
click buy he's like started to do this
[ __ ] tricks like okay you know what

[35:01]
[ __ ] tricks like okay you know what
this is I have such a great day you can
have it half price and twice the stuff
and then you can if you click that and
that and then and and there were stuff
he was saying was obvious [ __ ]

[35:17]
he was saying was obvious [ __ ]
because it was
pre-recorded how could he know it's like
you are the 100 person today and stuff
like that and and I was like okay this
was weird but let's do it so I click

[35:32]
was weird but let's do it so I click
again continue let's buy it and he's
getting again like okay you can spend 25
more and you get this and that and
basically he
just I was just angry about it and

[35:47]
just I was just angry about it and
didn't buy at all so it was so you know
it probably would still worth it but it
was just so full of the over marketed it
is scammy over marketed scammy stuff I

[36:02]
is scammy over marketed scammy stuff I
just didn't want to get didn't want to
get it and yeah marketing marketing is
interesting
because like on one side it is necessary
because it works but also if you over

[36:17]
because it works but also if you over
Market it can come across that you're
overcompensating for a bad product so
you try to find kind of The Sweet Spot
within marketing but it seems like
nowadays any marketing tactic that you
use is immediately labeled as like ah

[36:31]
use is immediately labeled as like ah
this is [ __ ] you know another one of
these fake entrepreneurs online trying
to tell you that they can teach you
something yeah it's it's really hard
because it's just uh obviously you want
to get you want to have a good marketing

[36:46]
to get you want to have a good marketing
because so
many I'm pretty sure there are like best
books you could ever read but you're
going to never hear about because just
bad marketing
and there is the opposite when people

[37:00]
and there is the opposite when people
have like such a good marketing but such
a shitty product and I really like the
it's definitely not working for everyone
but I really like the approach when you
get stuff from free until the point you

[37:15]
get stuff from free until the point you
feel ashamed that you're not paying for
this so it's I think it's a good example
I I read many selfhelp books in my life
especially early on my career and

[37:33]
especially early on my career and
um I like I don't even know 10 years ago
I found like Gary V it was like grind
culture going hard kind of guy and I

[37:45]
culture going hard kind of guy and I
didn't I never saw him selling basically
anything I just saw the videos I like
the videos and I I felt like I got so
much value I just I just want to buy his
book even even even if I wouldn't read
it I just want to pay him pay this guy

[38:02]
it I just want to pay him pay this guy
uh to just have his book because he he
gave me so much without any money so and
I think your podcast is also like that I
I watched so many good podcast in here

[38:17]
I watched so many good podcast in here
and learned so much
stuff um I
I I'm already using and I I didn't have
to pay anything so that's

[38:30]
very very good strategy you're welcome I
mean you're giving something back to it
you know for all the for all the highx
poker players listening to this
conversation you know consuming and uh
you know there there's definitely a
couple of names that I now have in mind
that I know that consume a lot of these
content and that they're a little bit

[38:45]
content and that they're a little bit
hesitant to coming on himself maybe this
is like a little push in the push in the
right direction here from llo um you
pursued like poker you know to get in
that lifestyle how did you
or I guess I should reframe this like

[39:00]
or I guess I should reframe this like
how soon did you realize that this
lifestyle that you maybe saw on high six
poker is not acquired within a week you
know and it's maybe a little bit harder
than you initially expected or at least
I'm assuming here maybe it went like
straight away good from the start but

[39:15]
straight away good from the start but
usually you know we think that oh yeah
just play a little bit of Poker get G
get get to travel get nice
cars yeah I definitely had my faces
I I didn't have these expectations when

[39:30]
I I didn't have these expectations when
I started for sure because I started
playing uh so when I got my 50 bucks
free money I started playing these the
the lowest Stakes was only lowest Stakes

[39:47]
the lowest Stakes was only lowest Stakes
were nl10 so there was like no nl2 and
stuff and this was the S short te
strategy like you sit in with 20 big
blind on NL 10 and my my strategy was

[40:01]
blind on NL 10 and my my strategy was
sitting in 30 bigs not 20 as they said
because I thought I can win more
money was my big
strategy um so there was such a slow

[40:15]
strategy um so there was such a slow
stuff and I didn't even know that I can
make money of this and I I so clearly
remember when I won
like over the months maybe two months I
won like

[40:31]
won like
$400 and I still couldn't believe it
like if it's real it was on the account
but nothing else so there was the scre
but it was called money Bookers and
there was the

[40:45]
there was the
international Cash Out fee on money
Bookers so I had to transfer the fs from
money Bookers to to my credit card or or
maybe I'm not even sure but I had I

[41:01]
maybe I'm not even sure but I had I
remember it was like 300 bucks and I had
to pay 50 bucks for the for the
transaction and I didn't care like is
this going to be a real money and I had
my plan that I want to buy a sunglasses

[41:18]
my plan that I want to buy a sunglasses
I I looked for and a and a watch like a
cheap designer watch and I remember when
I somehow get the money out of the bank

[41:30]
I somehow get the money out of the bank
and like hold it in my hands and I
bought these two things right away it
was like unbelievable like so so it was
answering to your question it it was
even over my dreams like I couldn't
dream like I thought poker is going to

[41:46]
dream like I thought poker is going to
be like a just U have a little lunch
money next to the to the to the
university stuff but yeah after after a
couple months maybe 6 months one year

[42:03]
couple months maybe 6 months one year
then then I my expectations went up and
definitely started to think okay I can
get
millions and yeah that didn't go like
that and I remember I I started to so

[42:19]
that and I remember I I started to so
like every every young poker player who
get some money start to be like uh not
cautious and like not having any
bankroll management I remember my mom's

[42:32]
bankroll management I remember my mom's
uh Toyota Yaris car I was like uh going
for my friends going to parties and I
never asked for guest money and I I was
feeling the gas in the gas station like

[42:45]
feeling the gas in the gas station like
like this and didn't even look what's
going to be the price and every time we
every time we went for dinner with my
friends I was like guys I'm play I guess
this I I pain I get this um and

[43:02]
this I I pain I get this um and
um I had my big big first fall when when
I lost my whole bank roll from like I
think it's almost was almost like
$10,000 um yeah that was that was pretty

[43:17]
$10,000 um yeah that was that was pretty
much Rock
Bottom um I was playing um I was playing
six Max cash games from the beginning
basically
only this NL 10 10h handed for a while

[43:31]
only this NL 10 10h handed for a while
but after I swapped to six-handed
uh and um for some reason I started to
play heads up with some guy I thought
he's a fish and we played like two
tables and in my eyes he played so bad

[43:47]
tables and in my eyes he played so bad
probably he was much better than me but
I thought he's like a fish and I got so
tilted and sucked into the
situation I was like if I lose all my

[44:00]
situation I was like if I lose all my
money to this guy I don't even care
because he's such a big fish I should
been like so
much and yeah eventually I just I just
lost everything I don't even know how
did I get all my money on one side but

[44:15]
did I get all my money on one side but
usually there was like one side I was
playing and and have all my bank roll
there and it was I think like 3 or 4
a.m. in the morning when I I didn't have
any money left and it was raining

[44:30]
any money left and it was raining
outside but I had to go for a run so I I
was running for a.m. in the rain and in
the cold and I was thinking okay I I
never want to have this feeling again I
I just have to rebuild it somehow and

[44:46]
I just have to rebuild it somehow and
just yeah have to be careful about the
bankr management and everything and
since that I I got like very I think
very cautious some friends friends would
say like you are a bankroll meet and

[45:00]
say like you are a bankroll meet and
stuff like that but yeah I'm definitely
not but yeah more cautious for
sure it's it's it's it's interesting do
you think it
like I can see this both positively and
negatively impact the future of your

[45:16]
negatively impact the future of your
poke career for example if I talk from
my experience I had a similar experience
where due to going broke probably twice
or something like at some point I was
like okay [ __ ] at higher Stakes for
example is not for me I'll just keep on
grinding low stakes um did any any

[45:34]
grinding low stakes um did any any
something similar like that happened to
you where because you were now a bit
more risk averse and kind of a bit
traumatized by going broke you could
have maybe reached more success quicker

[45:45]
have maybe reached more success quicker
sooner or do you think it actually
helped you because you were just more
cautious now and that was kind of the
way forward for
you um I I think I think it helped me
because I I never had like super high

[46:04]
because I I never had like super high
win rate at the beginning so so what
you're what you're saying I think it's
very true for some players and it would
slow slow their uh

[46:16]
slow slow their uh
process um but I was actually
playing even too high to my skills for a
very long time so what I mean I remember
I was playing like

[46:30]
I was playing like
nl200 and I had like literally zero BB
per 100 but I was just saying to myself
I just need bigger fishes I'm just
running bad and I ended up playing like

[46:45]
running bad and I ended up playing like
1 million hand plus with the zero win
rates maybe rback
plus uh so I was still even if I was
cautious with with the bankroll
management and stuff I was definitely
not good enough and I I I always uh

[47:03]
not good enough and I I I always uh
chased
the the vennings uh so I I was thinking
about uh I I don't have time for
studying because I need to win

[47:15]
studying because I need to win
money um and I had a lot of expenses
because um I always try to help my
family and uh you know send money to my
mom pay my own uh everything uh so so

[47:34]
mom pay my own uh everything uh so so
basically I just uh I just felt like I
can win a lot by playing but I can win
by studying and I I studied but not not

[47:47]
by studying and I I studied but not not
much so in the in this case it it was uh
still not um I was still not playing low
enough to my to my skill level or I
should have studied much much more

[48:01]
should have studied much much more
before so I can see it kind of protected
you right because you were maybe a
little bit delusional of your skill
whereas I think in my case it was maybe
even the opposite I I'm I'm pretty sure

[48:15]
even the opposite I I'm I'm pretty sure
like from whenever I remember I would
just never never never ever a losing
month or something I would just always
win but I needed like more confirmation
so when that happened like I had POS
positive confirmation all the time but I
never really took it in as like okay

[48:30]
never really took it in as like okay
this means that I'm a good poker player
but then when I went broke it's like
yeah you see I already knew that this
wasn't for me or something like that you
know so I kind of used that going broke
as more of a confirmation you see I
should play it safe maybe this higher
six it's not for me even though I was I
mean I remember I was like probably like

[48:48]
mean I remember I was like probably like
100k in in makeup and I grinded it all
back playing like 200 or 400 an hour or
something but like and I granted it back
pretty quickly so definitely I should
have just played a little bit higher my
my skill level was definitely uh uh

[49:01]
my skill level was definitely uh uh
definitely too high for the stakes that
I was playing I would say Adam do you do
you feel like it on average would
negatively impact you or positively
impact you if you have like a downswing
experience or like a going broke

[49:15]
experience or like a going broke
experience almost like a traumatic
experience early on in your
career well I think like I said it can
go either way I'm sure every pocket
player listening has their own traumatic
experience of going for down swing I
think generally you're going to learn
the lesson of bankroll management to

[49:30]
the lesson of bankroll management to
some degree do I need to be more risk
cautious and for a lot of players it can
leave scars and I think players who want
to play high stakes if you're trying to
get high stakes quickly it's probably
going to negatively affect you because
you're going to be more cautious and
maybe not take risk when you want to but
a lot of players almost need to learn

[49:46]
a lot of players almost need to learn
that lesson they need to learn they're
not Invincible they need to learn a down
swings around the corner so it's hard to
say like on average is it good or bad
you guys are the polar opposite examples
of a good example of it and a bad guess
to kind of calibrate your personality I

[50:00]
to kind of calibrate your personality I
guess yeah I guess if you're over risk
taking to much risk it's going to
balance that out a bit if you're already
quite risk averse and then you have a
big downswing maybe that's the kind of
deciding factor that makes you too risk
ofers but I think learning as you go

[50:15]
ofers but I think learning as you go
through your career how much risk do you
want to take on for your current
situation so if you're wanted to play
higher Stakes you're going to have to
take on more risk if you wanted to play
the current stakes and gr a good win
rate you need to take on less risk so
yeah I think just being very mindful of
the experiences you're having and how

[50:30]
the experiences you're having and how
they impact your opportunities in the
future if it makes you yeah more
cautious or yeah limits you too much
that's going to be a
problem all right L to dive into from
from high side so yeah you mentioned
this down swing or this losing 10K at
heads up and then you said you went for

[50:45]
heads up and then you said you went for
a run at 4 in the morning and then on
that run you decided never again I'm
curious to know what thoughts went
through your mind in that run and how
you then transitioned that into making
some changes to your approach to PO so
you didn't go broke

[51:00]
you didn't go broke
again yeah I mean the the feeling was
just so bad um I was so em embarrassed
by
myself um I just I I couldn't even think
about what can I what what I'm gonna say

[51:17]
about what can I what what I'm gonna say
to to my poker friends to my mom like
she was very skeptical first at poker
but then she she saw that I'm doing okay
she was kind of okay maybe maybe this

[51:32]
she was kind of okay maybe maybe this
could work out and uh yeah it was just
um like a like a bad dream or something
and I just I just promised myself I just
cannot do this again and and I I knew

[51:46]
cannot do this again and and I I knew
what I have to do about it and um yeah
fortunately it
worked um and um
I I think it it left a a big scar in me

[52:03]
I I think it it left a a big scar in me
uh and and then just basically I I
always wanted to avoid it uh no matter
what and that was like number one
priority for
sure yeah I think sometimes we can learn

[52:16]
sure yeah I think sometimes we can learn
a very valuable lesson very quickly like
when you're a child and you touch a hot
stove you don't need to touch it three
times you touch it once you're like St
hot don't touch it sometimes you almost
got broke and you're like this is really
bad for my future I don't want to touch
this again so we can make like big

[52:30]
this again so we can make like big
changes just from one big experience
especially if it's as painful as you're
describing it the shame the annoyance at
yourself the heightened emotions you've
quickly went right I know what I
shouldn't have been doing and how to
move forward so from here you've lost a
lot of your role talk us through like
how you started to build your role and

[52:45]
how you started to build your role and
how you start to move up Stakes so we've
got this kind of pivotal bad moment
you've had the Run you're not going to
go BR again talk us through how you
started your rebuild process and how you
started climbing up
sticks yeah
the rebuild beginning of the rebuild
process was funny because uh me a friend

[53:04]
process was funny because uh me a friend
of mine and me decided that the easiest
way to get back some bank roll is to go
play live because it's so much easier so

[53:15]
play live because it's so much easier so
I had a friend uh from the University
who actually get me into poker like
online poker he was doing the quiz on
poker strategy 4 me to get a $50
starting speack and and he he was very

[53:31]
starting speack and and he he was very
supportive to me and said okay uh
obviously I told him what happened and
he was like yeah don't worry about it uh
just go grind I give you some some bank
roll I think he gave me like

[53:46]
roll I think he gave me like
€3,000 and um so my other friend and me
decided to go to Vienna which is like
which is two hours drive from here and
we played some live catch games like one
two uh and we were obviously we didn't

[54:03]
two uh and we were obviously we didn't
have any he he was in a similar
situation and we didn't we didn't really
have money to spend so we wanted to save
some money and uh so so like not pay

[54:15]
some money and uh so so like not pay
hotels so we had like this perfect
strategy we go like uh 5:00 p.m. and
then we grind a whole day so we don't
have to have an accommodation for the
first night and then second night we
sleep in the car we can manage one one

[54:32]
sleep in the car we can manage one one
night sleep in the car and then the
third night we we sleep in a ib like
cheapest hotel possible so now we have a
little rest and then we can go on and

[54:45]
little rest and then we can go on and
and play two nights in a row and then
then so we had like a perfect plan for
five days and um well that didn't go
very well so first of all it was like
such a rake trap you we we play like one

[55:01]
such a rake trap you we we play like one
two the maximum buying was like 200 your
so you couldn't Buy in deep and which
was maybe a good thing for us and there
was like
mandatory um mandatory tip for the
dealers because that was their payment

[55:17]
dealers because that was their payment
and there were like huge rake like 15%
and also a jackpot so like if you play a
15 Eur pot it was like three four off
immediately so I think I was losing like

[55:33]
immediately so I think I was losing like
€ 1,000 and after day three and we were
feeling miserable I remember a guy was a
high sex player in hungry and and I was
sleeping in the car and waking up and

[55:47]
sleeping in the car and waking up and
eating like a yogurt or something and
he's coming out with my friend and he's
like oh hi oh guys you live in this car
what the hell are you doing and I was
also very
embarrassed and um I told to my friend

[56:03]
embarrassed and um I told to my friend
you know what I think this is a really
bad idea just losing money it's so much
rre I think we should
surrender and uh I think that was like
one of the best decision I I don't even

[56:15]
one of the best decision I I don't even
understand how could we do it this
decision in a bad State like that
because usually I would say okay now
it's we just do it and whatever happens
it happens
but I couldn't imagine if I'm not only

[56:30]
but I couldn't imagine if I'm not only
broke but owning my friend like
€3,000 what the hell I'm going to do so
uh we we went back and then I think in
the in the way back home I decided okay
there is one bulletproof solution I

[56:47]
there is one bulletproof solution I
think it's still very bulletproof and
the best scenario you can you can do if
you study a lot and if you play on Good
tables and you do this all day every day

[57:02]
tables and you do this all day every day
it's basically impossible to to lose in
the long long run because we you you're
going to keep you you protect yourself
and your win rate with good
tables and you even if you are maybe

[57:16]
tables and you even if you are maybe
let's say you're not winning on those
tables but there are like weak players
or recreational players you probably
been on the tables but then you keep
studying um so you basically protect

[57:30]
studying um so you basically protect
yourself and and I think this approach
actually worked for for almost 15 years
I just had to play games where I'm plus
CV and I have to keep had to keep
studying and uh yeah it was a very very

[57:46]
studying and uh yeah it was a very very
long grind I think it was like one or
two years but it was worth it and and U
yeah I eventually eventually I I build
up my own bank rle and I never had this

[58:00]
up my own bank rle and I never had this
issue
again yeah well great story so the
rebuild didn't get off to a fast start
but in the drive home you came up with
the the winning formula we call it
studying a lot and playing good games
and you do that long enough you're going

[58:15]
and you do that long enough you're going
to find a way to make money um yes I
think it's a real sometimes we need to
have a bad experience or to go through
things to realize what what we're doing
wrong and different approaches for you
it felt like although these are two
experence es we've went through which
were very painful it feels like they've
led to some clarity on what you need be

[58:30]
led to some clarity on what you need be
doing going forward so yeah I'm curious
to know from this moment you've on the
drive back you decided you want to study
a lot and start getting good tables talk
us for like when you started having some
success so we talked about the uh kind
of tough part of like struggling to have
a bank all to us through when you
started to uh yeah get get some success

[58:46]
started to uh yeah get get some success
make move stakes and started go how this
thing is actually working and I can
actually make Liv from this
game yeah so after I I definitely had
like a long stretch
of like very low win rates for a very

[59:02]
of like very low win rates for a very
long time uh but I was still winning
because I was playing a lot I had break
back and um I just grinded a lot and I I
studied always So eventually I

[59:15]
studied always So eventually I
I maybe I even dropped back some stakes
and scheduled more studying and stuff
and eventually
uh I I got much better and I my win rate

[59:30]
uh I I got much better and I my win rate
got higher and I was able to even go up
and uh and got some I also got got some
coachings as well for sure I had back in
the time Paul Oto internet he was very

[59:48]
the time Paul Oto internet he was very
not well known um cash very very smart
guy German guy I had couple coachings
with him him and I just watched every
single video I could find online and and

[1:00:00]
single video I could find online and and
just uh study what they do differently
what should I do stuff like that um lot
of hand history
reviews um and yeah it it somehow it

[1:00:15]
reviews um and yeah it it somehow it
just started working and I was able to
also split my role into different rooms
I played many many rooms I had time
where I was like only into bomb hunting

[1:00:30]
where I was like only into bomb hunting
to like have the highest win rate
possible but I don't want to R War at
all I just I just want to win money so I
had a couple years of that too and that
was obviously very successful because I

[1:00:45]
was obviously very successful because I
I had much less uh variance and I had
you know I I had like six seven eight
poker rooms uh up to nl1 K 2K and was
playing the best tables possible and

[1:01:00]
playing the best tables possible and
yeah it was working
finally and then
later I started feeling okay I maybe I
just want more and uh I want to you know
be better than other rexs too I and
there was the this time where bomb

[1:01:16]
there was the this time where bomb
hunters get a bad repap obviously and
things got out of control like people
were using scripts people were doing bad
behaviors like grimming all the time
sitting out when when the recreational

[1:01:31]
sitting out when when the recreational
sits out so it was like very bad
reputation from the big bumb hunter guys
and I I didn't want to do that either
and I obviously always wanted to be like
really good and and play against rexs

[1:01:46]
really good and and play against rexs
too and beat the rxs and stuff so then
then I started to play 300 400 as well
uh
4-handed and um yeah just just kept
studying whatever I could

[1:02:00]
studying whatever I could
study and um and eventually it
worked what was driving you throughout
this you mentioned wanting to get good
want to get better at the game I'm
curious to know what was the intrinsic
motivation to want to keep studying to

[1:02:15]
motivation to want to keep studying to
want to keep doing better and
improving well it was
definitely um
I I cannot say I was like so so if you

[1:02:31]
I I cannot say I was like so so if you
ask
a like a prodigy poker player who they
they would say like they were never
motivated by the money they just wanted
to play and and the Money Follows and I
completely agree but but I was

[1:02:46]
completely agree but but I was
definitely more motivated by the money
and and winning money and I I remember I
was I was doing okay but I had so much
spending on my on my uh flat on to my

[1:03:01]
spending on my on my uh flat on to my
mom's uh so so I I wanted to to help my
mom and and uh she she wanted to sell
our old house and move into a smaller
one because it was expensive to to uh

[1:03:16]
one because it was expensive to to uh
pay by herself alone and I I didn't like
change at all so I was motivated to to
just pay this stuff and you know pay my
stuff and everything and even help my

[1:03:30]
stuff and everything and even help my
sister sometimes so I always had this
problem that I was doing okay but I
couldn't build a bigger bank rle because
I'm I'm spending a lot because of these
issues so I had this brilliant idea 400

[1:03:45]
issues so I had this brilliant idea 400
IQ idea that I just have to win that
much that even if I pay everything for
my mom and sister it wouldn't cost
anything like compared to the winnings
so that was my biggest motivation and

[1:04:00]
so that was my biggest motivation and
and eventually I got that and and uh
finally I was able to to build my bank
roll because even if I I was spending uh
like a, $2,000 to these stuff uh
compared to the winnings it wasn't that

[1:04:16]
compared to the winnings it wasn't that
big effect and I was able to so I got
the pressure off and I was able to just
accumulate money I I I have a lot of
friends who have the same problem they

[1:04:31]
friends who have the same problem they
say they are good winning money but they
winning exactly as much as they're
spending and they cannot go forward and
if you think about it it's kind of
a um Mouse wheel or how do you say it

[1:04:47]
a um Mouse wheel or how do you say it
yeah because um because uh you cannot
really afford to yourself to study more
because you have exactly like 140 hours
and you make your exact money you have

[1:05:01]
and you make your exact money you have
you're going to spend and basically yeah
in in you you trapped a little bit and I
had the same issue but then after I
basically broke out and and I had okay
now I have much more time to study much

[1:05:17]
now I have much more time to study much
more time to play less Stables higher
Stakes focus better on the
decisions yeah
yeah I think it's a very important topic
to talk about building your bank rle and

[1:05:31]
to talk about building your bank rle and
breaking out of that kind of that
threshold where you're just making
enough to survive I'm sure lots of
people listening can relate to this I
can picture this myself me me and my
friends went to Thailand to kind of help
solve this problem we wanted to live
really cheaply low cost and to build our
bank roll and we were grinding full-time

[1:05:46]
bank roll and we were grinding full-time
every day for like nine months and we
did a bit a in with our money at the end
and we were dead broke right on the
threshold another payment came out and
we're like what theck hell can we do to
lower cost so we looked at how much SP
on food what a living costs were and it
very quickly became obvious that you can

[1:06:00]
very quickly became obvious that you can
only squeeze your living cost so much
for you obviously you had your parents
that you're paying for other outgoing
that might have been non-negotiable for
you but even like the the things you
have to pay for rent bills come to a
certain cost and we remember sitting
there going the only option is to make
more like play higher and it's one of

[1:06:15]
more like play higher and it's one of
those kind of realizations where you're
like if I keep making this much money
and then we start thinking what Stakes
do I need to play how much hours do I
need to play what's the kind of
threshold so if you're playing 25nl or
10 NL you probably a threshold once you
get 50s hundreds there a Breaking Point
where you get above and when you're

[1:06:31]
where you get above and when you're
underwater sort of speaking you're
almost like in that survival State you
need to pay for the bills it's really
hard to think about what you actually
want to achieve what the future goals
are why you're playing this game and
really start to uh tap into your full
potential so the first thing is how do I
build my bank roll how do I get enough

[1:06:46]
build my bank roll how do I get enough
saved or uh make enough money so that I
can cover all my living costs and then
have some spare and as soon as you that
for a while that compounding effect of
that kind of extra profit builds more
more more of a buffer you can play
higher games and there like a compound
effect but yeah I think your story was I

[1:07:00]
effect but yeah I think your story was I
can definitely relate to that myself as
well as being stuck where you just
making enough and all your living costs
just take it all and you're like what am
I doing with this game how do I get
going so yeah I think it's a a good
reminder to keep going to realize that
the the solution is often to of
obviously lower cost if you can but
you're GNA have to make more money to

[1:07:16]
you're GNA have to make more money to
get yourself above that threshold
exactly I I wanted to do the same like I
tried to my my first uh uh plan was just
minimizing every cost what I do or or

[1:07:30]
minimizing every cost what I do or or
every payment and every spending but
this didn't work it was still a lot
compared to the winnings and and the
other option was just make more
money yeah I think like when you look at

[1:07:45]
money yeah I think like when you look at
like in terms of exponential like
Improvement of the situation you can
only like lower your spends by say 10%
20% maybe 30% but you can increase your
how much you're inning by double treble
like 10x over time so there's much more
margin to to make more um but yeah

[1:08:00]
margin to to make more um but yeah
obviously if you work on both
simultaneously lower spends and then
increase your income um yeah but I think
it's a very important conversation
especially for anyone struggling to
build a role I know myself I was so
frustrated like the first probably two
years AP po I've just how hard I felt I
was working and then checking the bank

[1:08:15]
was working and then checking the bank
roll at the end of the year going still
nothing is this still what you get for
it you still get peanuts for all this
work but this is a threshold where you
want to get above it like it compound so
quickly from that point so yeah anyone
listen to this struggling keep it going
try to find that next opportunity to
make more money and to increase your win

[1:08:32]
make more money and to increase your win

and maybe you will get a chance to work
with me and Adam and make more progress
in in your poker career but for now
without further Ado let's get back into

[1:10:30]
without further Ado let's get back into
more goodness in today's episode so I
want to transition the conversation a
little bit to uh science and you
mentioned you're a hardcore science
nerded heart and you love data and data
oriented thinking H so I'm curious to
know what forms of science you think are
useful for maybe a general mindset which

[1:10:47]
useful for maybe a general mindset which
is helpful for poker players so what
what are some the sciences that you've
found interesting or data oriented
thinking that you found
helpful
yeah uh I think definitely critical
thinking is very very good and

[1:11:03]
thinking is very very good and
important um
I'm actually not sure about a few stuff
because uh I I was
always thinking critically and u i I

[1:11:17]
always thinking critically and u i I
thought it's because of Poker because
poker needs you know you have to get the
facts
straight and right and you have to get
this the strategies right and always

[1:11:33]
this the strategies right and always
thought about okay I probably think like
this because of Poker but then I met a
lot of successful poker players who were
really not critically thinking and and

[1:11:46]
really not critically thinking and and
maybe even think in my eyes believe in
stupid stuff and U they were still very
successful
and uh I realized that I was probably
thinking like this before

[1:12:01]
thinking like this before
poker um not sure why maybe I was always
like
real um like how do you say like real
stuff real oriented like in the subjects
like mathematics informatics

[1:12:16]
like mathematics informatics
stuff um but um I think it it
um also helped in poker and poker in the
thinking as well because I always had to
search for the for the right material

[1:12:32]
search for the for the right material
and the
right videos and and coaching uh uh
material yeah I was going to say I think
a scientific mind generally helps for
poker because like as you mentioned
critical thinking which is generally if

[1:12:46]
critical thinking which is generally if
you think of what science is it's having
a hypothesis of what is right or what's
the right way to act behave whatever it
is and then testing that and then
getting data to back up that kind of
assumption and over time science
correlates to to data points and that
data point shows this works out more

[1:13:01]
data point shows this works out more
often this works out less often and if
we don't use some sort of scientific
thinking we very often get sweared by
small samples whether that's our own
experience we go this worked for me and
you go okay great that work for you but
it doesn't really show that that's a
winning strategy or a winning way to

[1:13:15]
winning strategy or a winning way to
approach things so I think the
scientific critical thinking way is
always like trying to think of the data
points how much data correlates to to
this and can I test this hypothesis and
I even think of my my PO career started
with a bit of a a science experiment it
was almost like let's go to Thailand and
in three months we're going to see if we

[1:13:30]
in three months we're going to see if we
can make money playing poker let's let's
go where n equals one experiments let's
go there if it works out we we keep
going if it doesn't we're back to tell
our friends in the pub how much of an
idiot we are but we don't know it's like
testing hypothesis I think this could
work let's get some data on it let's
build the sample size and let's like
kind of um yeah get a bit of data on

[1:13:47]
kind of um yeah get a bit of data on
that to to look back on so another thing
you've mentioned which I really want to
dive into you said you're obsessed with
survivorship bias which I think really
ties well to this topic in terms of
selection bias I classify bias as we see
that the kind of top of the pyramids
like people are successful and we forget

[1:14:01]
like people are successful and we forget
all the kind of data points underneath
the people who haven't failed so a good
example is you look at all the startup
businesses and you look at all the
billion dollar companies you forget
there's like a thousand companies that
failed on a similar start Venture and
you only see the top one you go that was
a great idea but you forget below this

[1:14:15]
a great idea but you forget below this
now You' mentioned you think
survivorship bi is very important for
poker players in the St I'm curious to
know for you how you've used that kind
of hypothesis and how you feel it's a
useful skill for po players to learn
about yeah so I I always got frustrated

[1:14:33]
about yeah so I I always got frustrated
by so I I was playing mtts as well live
and online too and boy the thingss you
can have there is insane and especially

[1:14:45]
can have there is insane and especially
live where you play even if you play the
whole Vegas series you you're gonna play
like couple thousand hands it doesn't
mean basically anything and you can you
can R run bad for your lifetime playing
live tournaments probably you're not

[1:15:01]
live tournaments probably you're not
gonna if you're good probably you're not
gonna like losing money but easily you
never GNA have a big score and the it's
really depended on your big scores and I
I never like when people had like

[1:15:18]
I never like when people had like
a god run hot run series and they were
like justifying everything with that
uh I can give you a so ridiculous
example so there was a friend of mine I

[1:15:30]
example so there was a friend of mine I
started playing poker with uh on the
University I already mentioned and he
was he was on a heater he he won a
tournament online and then we went to
the live series and he won a tournament

[1:15:46]
the live series and he won a tournament
there and he actually said to me that
now I feel if I really focused on a
tournament I can win it like he
genuinely believed this that if he

[1:16:01]
genuinely believed this that if he
focused enough he can win a to and like
what so so people can
be uh delusional with this so so hard
and U there was always you know it's

[1:16:18]
and U there was always you know it's
very weird in poker when you have
friends and you root for them but they
run insanely hot and you just don't run
good and obviously you're happy for your
friend and it's much better than someone

[1:16:30]
friend and it's much better than someone
else winning it but you have this weird
feeling that you oh maybe I deserve it
he doesn't deserve it and obviously
every single poker player thinks he's
the unluckiest poker player alive that's
just the way how we feel about poker but

[1:16:48]
just the way how we feel about poker but
uh I think I
was I also predicted some friends that
if you do this or do that you're going
to be broke and they went broke and they
didn't listen so they got cut with the

[1:17:04]
didn't listen so they got cut with the
result oriented thinking and yeah it's
po it's it's so weird in poker the
feelings when you when you get a 25%

[1:17:15]
feelings when you when you get a 25%
potb on the river and you have to be
good like one out of five times it's
impossible to to relate on your feelings
because you're going to lose the even if
people Bluff enough and probably they do

[1:17:30]
people Bluff enough and probably they do
you're going to lose most of the time so
uh the normal learning process is you do
something you you have a feedback it's
wrong or right and you improve yourself

[1:17:45]
wrong or right and you improve yourself
but in poker it's all messed up because
so many times you get a feedback which
is inaccurate or maybe even wrong and
you think you did the right thing but
you did wrong and the opposite is well

[1:18:00]
you did wrong and the opposite is well
as true so it's really hard to truly
realize when you learn something in
poker and it works and we had this idea
with another poker player that in maybe
not now all these solers you can you can

[1:18:18]
not now all these solers you can you can
see the strategies and
justify what what is right and what is
wrong but in the in the previous area
you could you could even run bad with

[1:18:30]
you could you could even run bad with
your strategy choices so let's say you
think okay I think people just overfall
to over bats let me try and then you run
into nuts three times in a row you just
don't want to try again I lost three
binds and maybe that was the perfect

[1:18:46]
binds and maybe that was the perfect
strategy against the field and you would
make a lot of money but you just had a
bad run and you think it's not working
and it wasn't possible to check it with
a solver or with M data analysis or
anything like that so so you would just

[1:19:01]
anything like that so so you would just
drop it and maybe some other player
would do the same as you but work every
time and then he keeps this strategy and
turns out it's the best strategy against
the pool so he's like crushing crushing

[1:19:15]
the pool so he's like crushing crushing
the games so it's so so complicated and
you have to be really careful and I have
U I know a lot of poker player who I
would consider like Geniuses I I just
don't understand how they know what they

[1:19:32]
don't understand how they know what they
cannot even explain it and five years
later you check in the solver and you
realize that it's working because of
that and you tell them did you know that
your stuff is working because of that
and I didn't know that I just I just did

[1:19:47]
and I didn't know that I just I just did
it and it
worked yeah so how do we navigate these
false feedback loops so as you mentioned
like in a lot of the time you can make
the kind of correct player but not get
rewarded if actually get punished in the

[1:20:00]
rewarded if actually get punished in the
short term losing Parts I think feedback
works best when it's direct if you do a
good action you get a good reward if you
get a do a bad action you get punished
but pocket just doesn't work that way at
all if anything it's like aetric returns
where you only need to be right a
portion of the time and as you mentioned
as well sometimes you can be right but

[1:20:15]
as well sometimes you can be right but
just get get a get punished like a
bluffing spot where you run into the top
of his range so with that in mind how do
we learn to handle that better cuz is
not going to change anytime soon we're
constantly in these spots where we're
getting kind of false feedback and it's
playing on our emotions playing on our

[1:20:30]
playing on our emotions playing on our
insecurities how did players learn to
deal with these false feedback
loops yeah I think it it got easier over
time because if um if I come up with my

[1:20:46]
time because if um if I come up with my
own example I played so many hands I'm
not sure but probably close to between
five and than 10 million hands in my
lifetime so maybe even more not sure so
basically you you can have a huge

[1:21:02]
basically you you can have a huge
database and uh I think you just have to
understand that you don't care about
your feelings like your feelings not
going to be the the guide in this game

[1:21:16]
going to be the the guide in this game
uh may maybe
intuition when you have a strategy and
and intuition works for sure but just
feel things um it just you cannot rely
on them and basically I think what you

[1:21:31]
on them and basically I think what you
should do is you can study the spot in
checking a solver and try to you know
even nolock or
just uh think about how the players

[1:21:45]
just uh think about how the players
would play and it would work with
the uh the properties you gave and also
you can just have to use data and you
have to prove like a friend of mine

[1:22:00]
have to prove like a friend of mine
showing me a hand and he said you look
at this call how good this call is and
he's winning and I'm like okay
yeah uh this a this is a nice hand but
can you prove it like can you we can we

[1:22:15]
can you prove it like can you we can we
can check in a solver and you can say
that they would not play like this you
can see the bluffing hands and you would
say like they bluffing much more because
you can clearly see that these hands are
not bluffed um and that's some kind of

[1:22:33]
not bluffed um and that's some kind of
proof but probably not enough and you
can also check your database and see if
people truly Bluff enough these spots or
do that or do that and yeah I think now

[1:22:47]
do that or do that and yeah I think now
it's much easier by 5 10 years ago it
was so much difficult because you you
couldn't be even sure like how how could
you know you you just had to talk with
all the players and have a conclusion

[1:23:02]
all the players and have a conclusion
what's works and what is not
working yeah I like that you said data
over feelings I think that's a very good
way to phrase it and as you mentioned
now we can look at the data and also
look at like solvers and how they play

[1:23:16]
look at like solvers and how they play
and we can see not only what the data
looks like but also what that would mean
about the strategy in the past you might
have had the data from our hand
histories or pocket tracker and we still
had to make assumptions about the data
it's like oh this data is this number
that means now we've got the whole
strategy kind of out in the open and I
think it's understanding that like

[1:23:30]
think it's understanding that like
feeling are subjective which means we
have our own individual what we think
about stuff whereas data is objective
which means it is what it is you can't
argue with data you can manipulate data
I guess but it doesn't lie so if you
learn to look at data as a kind of
almost like a an acid test they call it

[1:23:45]
almost like a an acid test they call it
where basically this is the kind of
thing I'm going to test against and then
do your feelings validate the data or do
they go against the data and as you
mentioned like I like what you said to
your friend like do can you prove it can
you prove it's a really good way of
going show me the data show me the data
I I know your feelings but show me the
data and if they can't show you any data

[1:24:01]
data and if they can't show you any data
they might be able to show you 20 hands
or 20 experiences we had and even then
the conversation then goes oh do you
realize the sample size you're using is
quite small you're telling me that your
feelings this way but we haven't got
enough data to to know that yet and then
I think educating people on yeah kind of
sample sizes and what data is important

[1:24:16]
sample sizes and what data is important
so uh yeah for you in terms of how
you've been able to use data and you
mentioned as you've kind of evolved in
poker and how solvers become more
apparent how is your use of data H
become more efficient or helped you more
as you've built your sample from zero
hands to 10 million hands how have how's

[1:24:31]
hands to 10 million hands how have how's
the data over feelings helped you to
kind of navigate your PO
career
okay so

[1:24:46]
um well
um definitely the over the years I I got
better at this
and um also everybody got better at this
and had better videos about it and

[1:25:03]
and had better videos about it and
better softwares like hand toote you can
do range research on your
field uh just basically have more
hands
um

[1:25:16]
um
and it it's funny because it was
definitely one of my
mistakes um that every time a new
software came out I was hesitant to
spend money on the software and not use

[1:25:31]
spend money on the software and not use
it and every time I delayed something
that I don't need that it's just you
know
um uh I I realized that I should have
bought it sooner so it it was like

[1:25:48]
bought it sooner so it it was like
consistent during my career that's
definitely was one of my biggest
mistakes that uh something new came out
I didn't hop on the train soon enough
obviously there was the other side when

[1:26:02]
obviously there was the other side when
I had friends who bought everything
every course every solare everything and
they never used it never watched it uh
and obviously that's the other other
side of

[1:26:16]
side of
the spectrum and you don't want to do
that but usually technology science and
and softwares are so much better than
than just human powers and uh you just

[1:26:34]
than just human powers and uh you just
it's it's very useful to to use them and
also I had a similar experience in my
teamworking abilities so like poker is
is a strange sport because you think

[1:26:47]
is a strange sport because you think
you're playing alone and you're like a
lone Warrior and I always felt like it I
do much better if I study alone I I was
secretive with my strategies my ideas I

[1:27:01]
secretive with my strategies my ideas I
was worried about it's going to be you
know stolen and everybody going to do
this little trick I knew obviously I had
a few friends we were sharing strategies
with but it's it's always turned out to

[1:27:15]
with but it's it's always turned out to
be false and when I was open about my
strategies and everything with another
guy and and we were to working together
it was always so much better for me and
I realized that it's just it's even if

[1:27:33]
I realized that it's just it's even if
it looks like
a
um U like not a team sport it it's
definitely a team sport especially now
when you it's just impossible to figure

[1:27:46]
when you it's just impossible to figure
out everything by your own and um you
just you just have to be open and study
with others and you it's usually it's
going to benefit you more than than you
think it would hurt you and also I had

[1:28:04]
think it would hurt you and also I had
um so so always this coaching topic is
difficult too because uh there are a lot
of coaches there stopped playing and
they couldn't win anymore and they just

[1:28:16]
they couldn't win anymore and they just
you know the classic saying if you can
do it just uh coach it and um uh and and
there are other coaches which are like
probably good but like super super
expensive like if you if you're going to

[1:28:32]
expensive like if you if you're going to
spend $1,000 for one hour coaching it
it's really really hard to get the the
stuff out of one hour and uh obviously
the coaching for profit is much
different and maybe maybe it's a better

[1:28:48]
different and maybe maybe it's a better
construction uh but then I
realized uh that uh there are
coaches who are not playing competively
competitively anymore uh but they are

[1:29:02]
competitively anymore uh but they are
super smart and I had uh my coach from
run it once Tyler Forester for for some
time and I mean he was just so smart

[1:29:15]
time and I mean he was just so smart
with some stuff I would never
ever uh come up with that by
myself uh so even he he wasn't
competitively playing High sticks uh
when I was playing them I I learned so

[1:29:32]
when I was playing them I I learned so
much stuff from him and and his
coachings because uh he was way smarter
in other areas than me and yeah that was
a good
realization in all of these three

[1:29:47]
realization in all of these three
categories like you shouldn't spare your
money when there a good product which
could help your your game you should
work with others for sure you don't have
to be secretive maybe if you're the one

[1:30:01]
to be secretive maybe if you're the one
and only genius and you're on the top
already maybe it's just can hurt you but
usually usually you're just going to
gain something from it and also with
coaching I was very skeptical and I
think being critical and skeptical is a

[1:30:17]
think being critical and skeptical is a
good thing but you just have to be able
to change your mind and and have to be I
I definitely had coachings I didn't like
and I was I felt I spew money on it but

[1:30:32]
and I was I felt I spew money on it but
but on the other hand I I just found
stuff which I would never figure out my
by myself it's just people so many
people think different way on the game
about the game and different areas and

[1:30:47]
about the game and different areas and
yeah you never know what what you can
learn yeah New Perspectives I think you
can't really uh put the price on how
much they're worth to you in certain
Avenues and you mentioned kind of three
vehicles which I'm I'm curious to know
more about in terms of how they related

[1:31:01]
more about in terms of how they related
to you and other people as well because
you mentioned like say software new
software new technologies with Hansen or
GTO Wizards you mentioned working with
others and you mentioned taking on
coaches I'm sure a lot of people can
relate to thinking either or all of
those Avenues would be helpful but they

[1:31:16]
those Avenues would be helpful but they
feel resistance they feel like oh yeah I
kind of want to do that but they they
find a reason not to as you mentioned
new technology comes out or new software
and you go uh could be good but I'll
just wait for a while and then six
months later you're like all right I
need to use this so um why do you feel

[1:31:30]
need to use this so um why do you feel
as humans or yourself as an individual
are averse to taking on new things
especially if it could be a kind of door
opener to a high win rate or new
potential um for me it's definitely a a

[1:31:47]
potential um for me it's definitely a a
backand for kind of game so I would
say um first I was like okay let's buy
any coaching I can get because it's so
good and then you burn yourself with
something you think it wasn't worth it

[1:32:02]
something you think it wasn't worth it
and maybe you get you feel you you got
scammed or something and then you are
Never Getting coaching again especially
a guy is not playing competitively I'm
I'm not gonna ever get the coaching by
that or or not not playing even not

[1:32:18]
that or or not not playing even not
playing poker and
then um it's I I think for for me it was
really hard to come out of that um that
uh dig if you could say that because you

[1:32:33]
uh dig if you could say that because you
got burnt and it's hard to change your
mind but then you know I I spoke with a
lot of friends and they said oh I tried
this coach and he was amazing he said
this and that and it's so good and then

[1:32:47]
this and that and it's so good and then
eventually I okay let's let's give it a
try and it turned out oh oh my God I I
didn't even know about that and also the
same as I mentioned before with the with

[1:33:00]
same as I mentioned before with the with
the giving value and not expecting so
you can you there are coaches you you
start coaching at 2 p.m. and
2:59 he's like okay wrap it up we done 1

[1:33:17]
2:59 he's like okay wrap it up we done 1
hours done pay me stuff like that and
other coaches is like okay when when we
finish this topic we finish the coaching
guy um and they don't calculate like 60

[1:33:32]
guy um and they don't calculate like 60
Minutes uh I I did coaching myself too
and uh often I had like 1 hour 20
minutes something like that I I didn't
feel the need to

[1:33:45]
feel the need to
just finish right away so so you can
have this Vibe when somebody's truly
want you to to help you and Coach you
and it's not really motivated by only
money I think I saw a good f g on video

[1:34:03]
money I think I saw a good f g on video
recently when he explained about this
that it's probably better to have a
coach who is like not the best but uh
he's he's passionate about helping you

[1:34:17]
he's he's passionate about helping you
and about the strategies and stuff like
that rather than having the best player
in the world but he's just okay yeah
give me five grand and I give you some
coachings but actually he's going to be

[1:34:30]
coachings but actually he's going to be
like secretive and didn't show up in
time doesn't show up in time doesn't
care about your you you send a couple
hand histories and he's like okay we
talk about it if you buy a coaching or
something uh so you you you can

[1:34:47]
something uh so you you you can
be um you can be more assured someone is
gonna going to care about you and it it
helps with the with this process I think

[1:35:00]
helps with the with this process I think
and helps Chang changing your mind as
you mentioned going into a coaching
Arrangement is a bit like going to a
relationship you've got to like each
other you've both got to be invested
they've got to be able to communicate
well with you and the best player in the
world isn't necessarily the best coach I

[1:35:15]
world isn't necessarily the best coach I
think always for finding a coach you've
got to find the person who resonates
with you like there's a lot of free
content out there these days you can
generally get hours of thinking from the
person you want to work with before you
go into a coaching relationship you've
got to be able to resonate with them
they've got to communicate a way you
understand or get perspectives that you

[1:35:30]
understand or get perspectives that you
can take on board and not be like a a
robot who's very smart but might not be
able to relate I think you mentioned
like having a some smart players who are
really good but they can't explain their
strategy then five years later the
solver shows them what they do but
they're like H I didn't even know I was
doing that so you need to find that
balance between someone who's invested

[1:35:45]
balance between someone who's invested
in you and someone who yeah can explain
things in a way that is usable for you
so for you I'm curious to know of the
habits you've developed and the routines
you've established over the years which
have been the biggest game changers for
you in terms of increasing your

[1:36:01]
you in terms of increasing your
performance well that's a that's a very
good question because I I think I I
tried everything you can try like I had
the craziest morning
routines um I I was trying everything uh

[1:36:15]
routines um I I was trying everything uh
I can read
about uh and um I I definitely I'm not
sure if you guys had this but
uh when I had a huge list of morning
routines and I ended up feeling that I'm

[1:36:30]
routines and I ended up feeling that I'm
just doing endless stuff and I never get
to work and never get to do stuff down
so and I'm definitely still battling
with this one of that is uh
meditation I I was I was doing

[1:36:47]
meditation I I was I was doing
meditation and I was a meditation
skeptic because I didn't feel like it
helps and I'm I'm trying to do
meditation again I still don't have
a a final answer but um um so I I love

[1:37:04]
a a final answer but um um so I I love
challenges I um I think when you have
something
um like over you like you I mean a

[1:37:16]
um like over you like you I mean a
higher power basically so if you what
what I usually do is I give a free free
rooll to a friend like last time it was
it was Benjamin charot he's a good

[1:37:30]
it was Benjamin charot he's a good
french poker player living in Budapest a
good friend of mine and I told him okay
Benji I want to do this for one month I
gave the rules and if I don't complete I
give you uh
$2,000 um punishment fee and you have to

[1:37:47]
$2,000 um punishment fee and you have to
give it to the charity of your
choice and what I accomplished did this
is I took off the responsibility from me
like if I would give you an example um

[1:38:02]
like if I would give you an example um
if I eat too much um sweet stuff like
chocolate desserts everything I'm pretty
sweet food so it's hard to resist so I
always have this I'm grinding and I'm

[1:38:16]
always have this I'm grinding and I'm
like oh I could use like a Sneakers bar
or something and then yeah yeah but I
shouldn't get that it's it's not healthy
whatever so I have this constant debate
in my and and it's getting my um

[1:38:30]
in my and and it's getting my um
willpower but if I have a challenge like
this I know I just cannot do it because
it would cost $2,000 so it's so easy you
you start you don't even think about it
anymore because you can't and um I think

[1:38:45]
anymore because you can't and um I think
it's a really good way of thinking that
um sometimes you cannot trust even
yourself and it's bad better to just
Source it out and uh and you perform
much better so um I

[1:39:02]
much better so um I
had I I I cannot say if if I would say a
game changer that's that's quite of a
game changer but I cannot do challenges
every single week and month and um I can

[1:39:18]
every single week and month and um I can
obviously feel when one challenge ends
and and obviously if I would start
another challenge it wouldn't be the the
as um powerful as before because that's

[1:39:31]
as um powerful as before because that's
the that's the reason why you take a
challenge um and um I I had a lot of
morning routines and doing a lot of
stuff but I never felt uh anything like

[1:39:45]
stuff but I never felt uh anything like
a big game changer there were stuff
which helped me a lot so like like
fasting I think helped me a lot but not
because fasting is some special thing I
mean you could argue that it's good for
longevity and yeah probably there is

[1:40:02]
longevity and yeah probably there is
debate on that but for me what works
with it it's just just the window that
okay after 900 p.m. I don't eat I don't
have to worry about eating and you know
I I know I cannot eat so it's takes off

[1:40:18]
I I know I cannot eat so it's takes off
the same takes of the pressure and um it
just much better to create uh Frameworks
around your your um work environment and

[1:40:30]
around your your um work environment and
your
life and it's easier less less thing to
worry about and I think the same with
poker I try to do like uh I love these

[1:40:45]
poker I try to do like uh I love these
TR time frames like Pomodoro or one and
a half hour sessions I like love these
sessions and rest and and standing and
walking and so I love these uh block
giving blocks to your day um like a

[1:41:02]
giving blocks to your day um like a
schedule and um I think it was useful I
I try to study all the time uh these
sessions like every day one one and a
half hour St sessions like in blocks but

[1:41:17]
half hour St sessions like in blocks but
also if I found find something which is
very very useful and and I can't wait to
use it in in real games then I just
forgot about the the time frame and the

[1:41:32]
forgot about the the time frame and the
Pomodoro it rings but I just continue
because I'm so involved so I love that
because that means uh I'm just I just
got so interested in the stuff I just
want to get to the bottom of it and uh

[1:41:46]
want to get to the bottom of it and uh
learn it well uh but as a starter I
think it's really good to you know have
these blocks and and have
you uh for example my my grind is is the

[1:42:00]
you uh for example my my grind is is the
best when I if I wake up and I have a
cup of coffee I feel like so motivated
and so focused that's like my golden
hour and I would love to grind all the
time like that but the problem is you

[1:42:15]
time like that but the problem is you
cannot really find good games all the
time when you wake up wake up unless you
live in Bali for example and you wake up
five a and you just jump into the cash
game actions so I don't have the best
time zone for that um but I can use my

[1:42:32]
time zone for that um but I can use my
time differently and I wake up and I
have the coffee and golden hour I
probably use it for studying or or
exercise gym or tennis or something like

[1:42:46]
exercise gym or tennis or something like
that and obviously definitely the
exercise is awesome for
for playing because you just think
better it's much better to you know you
have your exercise you you feel a little

[1:43:01]
have your exercise you you feel a little
bit tired but again you can you can
overdo it and I'm sure you felt it too
if you have like a sickest leg workout
it's much harder to to focus on poker so

[1:43:15]
it's much harder to to focus on poker so
it always comes with a cost and um I
think you can have like a good balance
uh um and U yeah usually usually these
things I mean it's pretty basic but I

[1:43:31]
things I mean it's pretty basic but I
don't think there is so many stuff which
is like the the best game Cher you just
have to be balanced and consistent and
it could be very boring to do the same
things every
day uh but that could just work

[1:43:49]
day uh but that could just work
best yeah I like the process you went
through and as you mentioned for you
there's no thing that jumps out as like
a a big game changer as such but there's
lots of little things you do that you
found that works for you so you

[1:44:00]
found that works for you so you
mentioned fasting which I class is like
a simplified strategy for dieting if you
think we all need to eat two or three
meals you need to figure out the
strategy for eating so simplifi the
strategy eating a shorter window you're
going to make less mistakes and it's
easier to stick to harder to OV eat if
you're someone who's going to wait you

[1:44:15]
you're someone who's going to wait you
mentioned having these kind of study
blocks and blocking out time I can
relate to that as well if I have a
six-hour window to be productive very
hard for me to be fully efficient but if
I have a 90-minute window where I'm
studying a very specific thing much
easier for my mind to commit to that and
you mention as well like you've got lots

[1:44:31]
you mention as well like you've got lots
of interest I'm sure if you had if you
didn't create structure your mind would
drift to lots of different things so
creating these kind of blocks of time to
work on different things is useful for
you in particular then you mentioned
this kind of golden hour in the morning
ideally you would grind but if not
you'll study do exercise and using that

[1:44:46]
you'll study do exercise and using that
I think it's just as every individual
we've got to figure out what kind of
routine would work for us based on what
we're trying to get out of ourselves in
that day if you're trying to get six
hours of grinding or three hours of
studying how is that fit in your day
what do you need to do around that
behavior wise to make sure you're

[1:45:00]
behavior wise to make sure you're
efficient you're feeling great when you
want to during those times and as you
mentioned you might not be able to align
it fully with a grinding schedule for
your alertness for example but you can
definitely use that time proactively to
uh to optimize your day it sounds like
you've done a a lot of trial and error
i' I myself as well had many elaborate

[1:45:15]
i' I myself as well had many elaborate
morning routines that needed simplified
over time but sometimes you got to try a
lot of things to realize what actually
works for me meditations a game changer
going outside getting uh fresh air
morning sun exposure um in hydration
hydration with water and salts they're
big for me in terms of how I feel in the

[1:45:31]
big for me in terms of how I feel in the
first 32 60 Minutes of the day but
they're not Magic Bullets either they're
personal to me that work but yeah find
that kind of cocktails very very
important so um I want to talk a little
bit about risk and we've talked earlier
how you had experiences of almost going

[1:45:46]
how you had experiences of almost going
broke early in your career or at least
in the rock bottom and how that was
impacting you in terms of not wanting to
go there again I'm curious to know as
you moved up higher stakes and the money
started get very significant in terms of
the what your lifestyle and things it
could affect how will you approaching

[1:46:01]
could affect how will you approaching
taking risk so let's use an example when
you were maybe shooting shot taking 1ks
moving from 500 to 1ks what was your
kind of bankroll management approach
during this phase and what was your
approach to risk were you someone who
was thinking calculated in terms of if I

[1:46:16]
was thinking calculated in terms of if I
play higher I make more money let's go
for it did you have any protocols in
place and how were you uh assessing risk
as you were moving stakes in your
career yeah I I tried everything I can
try and obviously about after this bankr

[1:46:35]
try and obviously about after this bankr
bankrupt incident I was much more
careful and I always thought about like
okay buying bankr management stuff like

[1:46:46]
okay buying bankr management stuff like
that but
actually uh I think it's much more
reasonable to
just be uh
aggressive when you have a good win rate

[1:47:00]
aggressive when you have a good win rate
and um if if I I mean I see players
who like crush the limit 10 BB per 100
maybe not 10 these years but very hard
crash the limits and they just don't go

[1:47:15]
crash the limits and they just don't go
up and yeah I mean I could understand
why they're doing this but um it's just
obvious you're going to move up maybe
you have a little slightly lower win
rate but you're going to pay less rake

[1:47:31]
rate but you're going to pay less rake
and you're just going to earn more money
so I would definitely recommend uh a win
rate based bankroll management and not
like it doesn't really say anything if
you have 100 bins or 20 bins I I would

[1:47:47]
you have 100 bins or 20 bins I I would
not recommend to 10 buying shop a steak
or something but but uh but you
definitely can be more aggressive with
your win rate I didn't have this problem
because usually I had lower win rates uh

[1:48:02]
because usually I had lower win rates uh
early on my career career so uh I just I
I rather had to move down than up and
improve myself and have better win
rates but then yeah when when I had

[1:48:17]
rates but then yeah when when I had
better wi rates I I just moved
up U even not having like 50 plus or 100
plus uh win rates uh but also I

[1:48:30]
plus uh win rates uh but also I
definitely can uh feel the age and uh
now I have a wife and we expecting a
child and it hits much differently than
it was 10 years ago
you the the daning hurts more for

[1:48:48]
you the the daning hurts more for
sure I'm sure you can relate and um now
I I just rather
have consistent and uh less uh money

[1:49:02]
have consistent and uh less uh money
variance like even if the win rate is
good uh maybe not going to take a shot
uh one stake or just you know sell some
action stuff like that uh I try to avoid

[1:49:17]
action stuff like that uh I try to avoid
big variant now uh I I got a little
little bit more uh careful about that
and yeah I think it's normal when when
you get older and and the the just

[1:49:31]
you get older and and the the just
things are so much
different yeah I think as you're younger
you can take on more risk one you
haven't got as much to risk in general
but also you've got a lot of time to
recover and the consequences of say
going broke are a lot a lot less like if

[1:49:45]
going broke are a lot a lot less like if
when I was in my early 20s I wouldn't
have mind sleeping on a SFA for a year
if I needed to to get myself on my feet
now I'm like do I really want to
sacrifice my current life to to grind it
back up and as you mentioned like
responsibilities increase as well and
you go through a from wanting to a choir
choir choir to wanting to protect

[1:50:00]
choir choir to wanting to protect
obviously you want to acquire as well
but you want to protect what you've got
you put a lot of time energy into what
you've got and it's a little bit
Reckless if you want to put it all on
the line in some High sck games and go
back to uh back to the start again but
yeah some people do play the high-risk
Life game so fair play to them if you
want to so for you in terms of H your

[1:50:17]
want to so for you in terms of H your
approach to actually taking a shot take
did you uh you mentioned win rate was
really good you mentioned always
studying and you mentioned good game
selection were you the kind of guy who
would wait for good games and kind of
shot TI slowly or would you go right my
win rate are good I'm going for that

[1:50:30]
win rate are good I'm going for that
game now and you were quite Relentless
and just played that game somewhat full
time uh I I always was like everything I
was back and forth and tried um every
kind uh of that um I I usually if I if I

[1:50:50]
kind uh of that um I I usually if I if I
I I try to maximize the the good games
and if I found a good game I jumped in
and and I try to stay in the game as
long as possible now uh maybe I would

[1:51:03]
long as possible now uh maybe I would
prioritize my sleep and my you know my
schedule but obviously there would be uh
exceptions
um uh and also it it's I think it's very

[1:51:19]
um uh and also it it's I think it's very
difficult with poker because sometimes
you think you are in
really plus CV game and then you realize
you're not
and this can change over the years

[1:51:31]
and this can change over the years
pretty D dramatically for example we
have this GG break uh you know um
boycott when people didn't play and we

[1:51:45]
boycott when people didn't play and we
in the in the community we shared a lot
of
rake uh schemes like h much rake we play
pay how much rake you can but how how
how good win rate you could have like
this table and that table and even I was

[1:52:03]
this table and that table and even I was
very careful I didn't realize that oh my
God I I have played so many bad minus CV
games and people tend to overestimate
their win rate they overestimate the the

[1:52:18]
their win rate they overestimate the the
recreational player R loss rate or even
your um
your position so we were started to try
to make some Excel sheets and
calculate over data that um how much you

[1:52:34]
calculate over data that um how much you
can win if the recreational on your left
and how much you can win if the
recreation on your right and how much is
The Rake so we had these sheets
calculating this and we were very

[1:52:46]
calculating this and we were very
shocked that yeah some some tables are
just drawing that and you should
shouldn't play them so even I consider
myself I was very cautious and um good

[1:53:00]
myself I was very cautious and um good
game selector I still had this problem
and and many players have this problem
and they didn't even know so it it had
to evolve every over the time almost
every year and um yeah just just have

[1:53:16]
every year and um yeah just just have
better understanding about the game and
the rake and the and the situation
and that that could that that helped a
lot for sure do you think in the modern
world of online poker it's kind of

[1:53:30]
world of online poker it's kind of
necessity for players to go for that
process to understanding how beatable
the games are how much the rake is where
the edge comes from do you feel like it
most stes that's say mid to high stakes
most players should be going for this
process to figure out how problem games
are um yeah I think I think most players

[1:53:47]
are um yeah I think I think most players
have to do this in in some degree
because
definitely there are some super great
players who just very very smart and
improve their s so quickly but I mean

[1:54:04]
improve their s so quickly but I mean
you have to understand
that the money basically comes from the
from the recreationals and uh if if
there is like six regulars it's very

[1:54:17]
there is like six regulars it's very
very hard and everybody's going to
overestimate their skill
so it's it's really hard especially if
you if you play in a high rake
environment it just uh you know some say

[1:54:30]
environment it just uh you know some say
you should play with the best and and
that's how you improve but I don't think
you have to play with them and lose your
money to them to to improve uh it's I
think it's better if you get prepared
and and U study otherwise like I I think

[1:54:50]
and and U study otherwise like I I think
yeah you should play like if you if you
want to hold lobbies and you want to
play three-handed obviously you have to
play and maybe you're going to be minus

[1:55:00]
play and maybe you're going to be minus
CV and it's a good practice but you you
just cannot know if how long how long
it's going to take and how it's it's not
a good strategy to play one year while
you m a CV and and I think a lot of
players even very very smart players and

[1:55:17]
players even very very smart players and
High s players
nowadays
get almost broke because of this
mentality and they think I mean it's
just it's just not infinite places in

[1:55:30]
just it's just not infinite places in
the highest in in in the in the among
the best players like it's not not like
you can have uh 100 best players in the
top like it's finite finite places and

[1:55:47]
top like it's finite finite places and
maybe you're going to make it maybe
you're not going to make it but you
cannot count that
um anybody just can jump on the train
and and you know just be there and win

[1:56:00]
and and you know just be there and win
as much as they win because there's
always other competition they always
other players and new players coming up
and somebody's going to so if if you
think about a six Max table like it's
six spots and not everybody's going to

[1:56:17]
six spots and not everybody's going to
win so the as you know the usual saying
that if the six best players play
together some of them are still going to
losing even if it is the sixth best

[1:56:30]
losing even if it is the sixth best
player and it's it's very true it's I I
see U coaching U and coaching for profit
advertisement that we make you this
winning player you're going to win like
this much and that much and I mean you

[1:56:47]
this much and that much and I mean you
you cannot say that because I mean it's
just finite place where people can win
that much money and you might not get
into
there even if hard yeah PO is like a

[1:57:02]
there even if hard yeah PO is like a
finite game where there's winners and
losers for you to win someone must lose
if six guys are at the table you can't
all be the winner at that table so it
just comes down to uh understand the
games you're playing and it comes back
to your your simple formula from a in
your career where you mentioned winning

[1:57:16]
your career where you mentioned winning
poker strategy is studying a lot and
playing good games and the good games
part is a very diverse variable
especially with the the modern games and
the way rake's calculated and stuff like
that players need to be a lot more
careful with what the class as good
games and to be mindful that maybe the

[1:57:30]
games and to be mindful that maybe the
games they're playing aren't as good as
they thought especially if their win
rates over long samples aren't
correlating as you mentioned it's not as
simple as many players might think and
as you you've mentioned that you had to
do uh a lot of work with a peer group to
come to conclusions about how profitable
games were so yeah I'm sure some players

[1:57:45]
games were so yeah I'm sure some players
will will go away and start thinking
about the games they're playing so Rena
for yourself how's your approach to game
selection changed over the years do you
feel like it's harder now to find good
games and yeah what's your kind of
approach to game selection no I would
say it's uh it's still the same I would

[1:58:02]
say it's uh it's still the same I would
also say your definition of a good game
really depends on your Evolution as a
player like especially when I was at the
peak of my career people usually said I
had very bad game selection whereas I
felt actually I had good game selection
I was battling a lot but that didn't

[1:58:16]
I was battling a lot but that didn't
mean I had bad game selection I was not
battling liners all the time you know
that would be bad game selection but I
was picking on which were in my opinion
the weaker racks who were willing to
battle so I always had a form of game
selection um yeah it just maybe looked

[1:58:32]
selection um yeah it just maybe looked
different for a pure bum Hunter looking
in if I'm battling three4 hand they say
you have no game selection but I clearly
did have game selection and I would be
smart when I would play someone in which
position I would play someone which
stake I would play someone for example I

[1:58:45]
stake I would play someone for example I
knew that there were some guys that when
I would start I know that they would be
at the end of their session I would
always pick I would battle those guys
because they've been playing for six
hours I just came in Fresh So I beg
myself coming in fresh against someone
who's already been playing for six hours

[1:59:00]
who's already been playing for six hours
so these are like it's broader than oh
you should play in a game with a fish
okay and even I think I think Lo also
said that like you have Rangers of fish
like it's in my opinion it's better to
play in a three or four-handed game with

[1:59:15]
play in a three or four-handed game with
a potential good seat on a future fish
for example then I see some tables run
with like a semif fish who maybe lose
like minus 10 and you're sitting across
it's like there's probably going to be a
more minus table in the long run than if
you just start a new three four-handed

[1:59:30]
you just start a new three four-handed
game with like a potential of a will
coming in etc etc so game selection is
broader than just you should play with
fish in my opinion I I think I I want to
want to add that to the whole game
selection story I also wanted to add
actually something to uh the morning

[1:59:46]
actually something to uh the morning
routine story I could definitely relate
to sometimes it's actually the same with
like a preet session like you can
sometimes have too much things and it
kind of loses its purpose right if you
just make a whole list of pression stuff
and you go into your session like wait

[2:00:01]
and you go into your session like wait
what what what was I supposed to do
again it kind of surpasses the purpose
of you want to just put your brain in
the right position in order to perform
and it's the same with morning routines
I think the the the main takeaway that I
got from morning routines I remember I

[2:00:15]
got from morning routines I remember I
read the book from Hell alod the miracle
morning which was actually like the
first self-development book that I've
ever ever ever WR uh ever read and it
was more the holistic idea of wait I
have influence on my performance or if I

[2:00:33]
have influence on my performance or if I
do certain things I will feel better and
if I do other things I will feel worse
it was more like that holistic approach
and necessarily I think he said you had
to read you had to meditate you had to
do some form of exercise I think that
was like hell Elrod's uh uh criteria and

[2:00:47]
was like hell Elrod's uh uh criteria and
I did that in the beginning but then it
became a bigger picture so oh wait the
food that I put in into my body have an
influence on how my brain feels right
some foods make your brain foggy other
foods make your brain not foggy well

[2:01:00]
foods make your brain not foggy well
maybe if I'm supposed to perform I
should eat something that doesn't make
my brain foggy right so it was more more
that that I thought that was very
helpful for me meditation or like
breathing exercises cold showers all
these type of things I found very useful

[2:01:16]
these type of things I found very useful
especially like pre session so usually
before I play I do something like some
whm Hof breeding cold shower meditation
to like quiet my mind I noce a huge
different in the quality of my decisions
be in my session if I do it or if I

[2:01:30]
be in my session if I do it or if I
don't do it and
especially nowadays if I if I want to
get into a session I'm like a I don't
want to do a 15 minute meditation it's
kind of the saying I think right if you
don't have time for a 15 minute
meditation you should sit down for 30
that's exactly like I know that if I go

[2:01:45]
that's exactly like I know that if I go
in rushed like oh man I I I just I just
if I have that feeling I know I have to
just sit down even though I really don't
want to it's more of a more of a alert
to myself that I should actually sit
bound because if I would now start
playing I would feel rushed and what I

[2:02:00]
playing I would feel rushed and what I
then notice I start rushing action I
want certain things or I start to play
very fancy I make a spew or something
like that so I notice like for me like
just quieting myself down before a
session is is is very key I also likeed

[2:02:15]
session is is is very key I also likeed
what you guys talked about um
eliminating decisions right to prevent
decision making fatigue with also the
fact that your willpower is not endless
uh I actually experienced this I was
playing nowadays I don't play that much
anymore but I was playing last week and

[2:02:31]
anymore but I was playing last week and
suddenly my wife called and she said oh
I'm having here I'm we're having some
drinks with some friends do you want to
come over and I was in I had good games
it was I think Friday night European
time I was like huh in the past when I
was clearly just focused okay I want to

[2:02:45]
was clearly just focused okay I want to
come the best I already made that
decision like someone could call me I
say what do you mean I'm here on my
purpose you know I'm trying to become
the best poker player possible I'm not
going to stop within three hours because
that's what I said I was going to do so
there was no decision now I was like
should I go but games are good but do I

[2:03:00]
should I go but games are good but do I
really care that games are good because
it's not really anymore my goal is my
social life more important you
understand and now suddenly I had a
decision so I was like should I stop
should I not stop I stopped then I
continued then I stopped again it was a
mess whereas in the past you know if you
have your decision made up before it's

[2:03:17]
have your decision made up before it's
so much easier right like what you said
with festing well I don't need so
there's no question or with your
Snickers bar I have a bat I'm not going
to eat a Snickers bar so I would say
making your decisions beforehand right

[2:03:30]
making your decisions beforehand right
and aligned with knowing what what what
kind of purpose you're currently on and
what's important to you that really
helps eliminate like this decision
making fatigue and in terms of like how
like also understanding that everyone is
different right and everyone performs
different like I said hell I said three

[2:03:47]
different like I said hell I said three
things Adam has his three things you
have a couple things everyone has
different things that clearly that they
clearly know hey this really works for
me to in order to find that you have to
experiment right uh for a long time

[2:04:00]
experiment right uh for a long time
especially when I was at the peing my
career every day like a priming priming
visualization session before every
session of like 20 30 minutes nowadays I
do that a bit less but back then it was
really like it was a no-brainer I
remember I would sit down and a friend
of M oh there's a good seat big will

[2:04:16]
of M oh there's a good seat big will
blah blah I said what do you mean I
didn't Prime yet you know like
definitely first 20 minute primer else I
don't play man it's like this is my
criteria um yeah yeah I like it sorry I
just yeah I realized like three four
things it's just such a good topic I I

[2:04:32]
things it's just such a good topic I I
had a I have a friend who is like very
funny guy he he he's he's the best
example for this what you mentioned he
had this uh okay guys I'm I'm focusing

[2:04:46]
had this uh okay guys I'm I'm focusing
on my session 10hour deep thinking most
focused session you ever seen and and if
you check his Skype is uh you can have a
caption under your name and it was
exactly saying like I'm having 10 hour

[2:05:01]
exactly saying like I'm having 10 hour
until the morning deep session focus and
then he gets a phone call hey Yani how
are you you want to go to the River and
throw rocks into the water and he's like
oh you know I cannot I cannot say no to

[2:05:16]
oh you know I cannot I cannot say no to
that and he just left his 10hour session
so he was the most easiest person to the
easiest person to you know derail from
from his purpose and U for example the

[2:05:30]
from his purpose and U for example the
the meditation is weird for me because I
totally understand what's the purpose
and uh I I can see it would help me uh
and I had this Challenge and I had
meditation every day and I felt like

[2:05:46]
meditation every day and I felt like
every day if I had to do the meditation
I'm like ah okay just let's do it and
let's get over with so it was the
complete opposite of meditation but but
when I'm playing and I'm not very
focused I realize that yeah meditation

[2:06:02]
focused I realize that yeah meditation
is this is what you can learn like you
have to eliminate all the stuff around
you and try to focus on one little thing
like breathing and you if you exercise

[2:06:15]
like breathing and you if you exercise
this a lot then obviously you can grind
and focus on little things and get
distracted like what's the this music in
piano version or or you know so it's
definitely I I totally understand what

[2:06:30]
definitely I I totally understand what
should do and uh that's why I try to
like force myself to do it but uh it's
it's uh it's difficult because I feel
like okay I have to do one more thing
before grind I I kind of in a rush but I

[2:06:48]
before grind I I kind of in a rush but I
understand what should do and I had a
very good experience
I started playing tennis like 5 years
ago four years ago and I I I didn't
expect that I can learn some stuff from

[2:07:02]
expect that I can learn some stuff from
tennis in to to put in poker and I have
a really good coach and I had this first
amatur tournament in tennis and I I was
losing very hard and I went to the coach

[2:07:17]
losing very hard and I went to the coach
and he's like what happened on your
first match and I was was like yeah I
lost like 60 61 something like that and
he's like yeah but how did you lose what
happened and I'm like u i I don't even

[2:07:32]
happened and I'm like u i I don't even
know it just happened so quickly I I
just lost and he's like no you you
cannot lose like that you you have to be
aware why did you lose like what went
wrong how did you lost the points like

[2:07:45]
wrong how did you lost the points like
did you have a lot of unforced errors or
did the other guy hit a lot of winners
you have to be
and realize what you did wrong and I
just realized I had this in poker so
many times I just can't wait to play

[2:08:00]
many times I just can't wait to play
poker I'm just over stimulated I jump
into the table 30 minutes gone I lost
seven binds and no idea what happened
and he's like the the same same idea you
have to be you you have to know how did

[2:08:17]
have to be you you have to know how did
you lose freaking seven binds in 30
minutes if you don't know you not not
paying attention and you're not focused
so I I can really relate to that and and

[2:08:30]
so I I can really relate to that and and
uh that's it right like I would say
meditation helps you notice I would say
that's the biggest thing because you you
mentioned like obviously also like you
will be more concentrated your might
wonders less but it's the difference
that when your mind wonders you will

[2:08:46]
that when your mind wonders you will
notice it more frequently so you can
return your focus back on the task at
hand it's not just I think I think you
do you probably do increase your focus
spans but it's more that I notice when
I'm distracted or like I said I notice I
feel a certain way before I start

[2:09:00]
feel a certain way before I start
playing so because I've had the same
experience that you that I just sit down
an hour went by Stacks flow over the
table it's like wait what the [ __ ] just
happened it's like I just lost like the
moment when I sat down to play and start
to play that was like I I was not

[2:09:15]
to play that was like I I was not
present for this last hour and suddenly
like what the [ __ ] just happened just
like your tennis match and I noticed
like with with
specifically these these things happen
less I was going to add like this thing
that happened to your friend would have
not happened with me because he said he
was going into a 10-hour session when

[2:09:30]
was going into a 10-hour session when
I'm in a session like you cannot call me
because there's no phone on there's no
Skype on there's no Discord on like what
the hell like we I remember I had a I
had an office back in the time and we
took it so serious that I had my dad
come over and we installed so we had
four desks in the office and we

[2:09:47]
four desks in the office and we
installed doors so you had like we first
of all I I built it like a bunker so we
added like uh uh we added basically wood
on both sides and on the end and there
was doors on the side so the the rule

[2:10:01]
was doors on the side so the the rule
was I would open my door so that's no no
one comes in and disturb me okay if my
door is is is is open you can you can
come in but when I'm playing I close the
door you know so yeah I I would take
concentration very seriously and like uh

[2:10:17]
concentration very seriously and like uh
yeah definitely no no distractions
allowed and when you notice yourself
getting distracted ra raed return back
to focus and then for example I would
have maybe like some questions to help
with that how how can I make how can I

[2:10:30]
with that how how can I make how can I
increase my win rate that this table
that was like I had a couple of these
questions whereas if I noticed that my
mind was wondering I would return my
attention back to one of these questions
how can I get the maximum out of this
table because often you know you get
bored you feel like I'm already winning

[2:10:45]
bored you feel like I'm already winning
so how can I get the maximum of my table
and then it's like oh wow actually let
let me think about that for a second you
know so you you you give your brain St
to think about now was like oh yeah I'm
just a bit out of piloting but actually
versus this guy H actually I've been
playing pre- flop wrong versus this guy

[2:11:00]
playing pre- flop wrong versus this guy
I should expand or I should tighten up
and then I should do this you start to
think kind of look ahead a bit in the
poker tree okay what's going to happen
at this table what's kind of the dynamic
at the table and how can I get more
money because it's very easy to sit down
especially I think you you mentioned the

[2:11:15]
especially I think you you mentioned the
certain period right you script into a
nice game you know it's like fish
everywhere I'm winning why would I pay
more attention that would zoom out like
in battles I I noticed I had that less
because I had like the competitive spark
but especially when when a recreational
would sit down let's say I'm battling

[2:11:30]
would sit down let's say I'm battling
for a half hour 45 minutes I'm very
focused recreational sits down and I do
like this ah recreational sits down I IM
I I noticed like my posture changed I'm
a bit laid back in my chair and my wiim
rates for a very long time in like 6and
games were way worse than three

[2:11:46]
games were way worse than three
four-handed games and they had nothing
that's very weird but that was
everything to do with how I approach
those games I would just Zone I would
not think anymore I would be like listen
the fish is here are making money but I
was not thinking about how can I still
make if I would apply I started to apply

[2:12:01]
make if I would apply I started to apply
the same philosophy I had to battles to
those six-handed games and two
recreationals and that's when you know
that that's when uh bigger win rats uh
start started to uh started to occur um
I wanted to ask something I know you've

[2:12:16]
I wanted to ask something I know you've
been in poker for 15 years I wanted to
talk about the scale of longevity
definitely something that you mustered
you also mentioned like when we asked
you like what are you most proud of in
your career you said that every year for
the 15 years that you played every year

[2:12:30]
the 15 years that you played every year
this current year is better than last
year so you manag to consistently
improve what are like some of the keys
to being successful over as long a
period of time in poker as you
have yeah uh well mostly mostly that's

[2:12:47]
have yeah uh well mostly mostly that's
true definitely I had I think I had one
or two years I didn't win or something
like that maybe my EV was great but on
the whole Spectrum it was it was really

[2:13:00]
the whole Spectrum it was it was really
funny
cuz I I always uh it it felt like I'm
run riding the horse backwards like the
games got tougher and I got I got better
and I get got better results and I like

[2:13:16]
and I get got better results and I like
what the [ __ ] I'm doing why I'm not
winning three 3x much money
before um but actually I had this idea
but about every every year you could

[2:13:31]
but about every every year you could
myself included you could hear people
complaining I wish I could go back five
years and play the same poker as I play
now I I would make millions because the
games were so good and even like if now

[2:13:47]
games were so good and even like if now
it's 2024 but you could go back three
years with the
accumulated skills you have now you
would be like in paradise and I thought
about the the opposite way like okay you

[2:14:02]
about the the opposite way like okay you
obviously cannot go back in time but
actually you can go into the future like
if you I mean study harder it's it's
hard to if you don't know what to study
but if you try to study harder and U get

[2:14:19]
but if you try to study harder and U get
ahead of the field
um then basically what you're doing is
going forward in time like you have your
skill you would have three years from

[2:14:30]
skill you would have three years from
now you ahead of the field and it could
mean that you go down in Stakes as well
but basically you time travel by going
into the future and and playing your
better game and I think I had this not

[2:14:47]
better game and I think I had this not
like every year but
basically I I always realized that okay
now I'm definitely ahead of my stakes
and what games I play so now I have a
nice win rate and then I slowly I got

[2:15:03]
nice win rate and then I slowly I got
cut on and people were playing similarly
or or even better and then I realized
okay now I have to study much more and I

[2:15:15]
okay now I have to study much more and I
like to as I mentioned before I like to
do stuff in Block
and uh I really like challenges when I
so so I I think U the the quality of the

[2:15:32]
so so I I think U the the quality of the
games is really time dependent like um
like summer or winter like winter is
like the one the best to go with and and
I always had this okay

[2:15:45]
I always had this okay
like uh September August September
something like that I can
uh study so much like even only study
maybe I didn't do that but I I could I
could even plan this and then and then

[2:16:02]
could even plan this and then and then
December January February when every
people staying at home Christmas bad
weather getting dark early gonna game's
going to be much better so I like to

[2:16:15]
going to be much better so I like to
prored like this and and then I had like
my own boot camps or even with friends
boot camps where okay guys now we only
study we just have to figure out how to
play better and then basically travel

[2:16:30]
play better and then basically travel
into the future and then I have these
good months where uh you can grind a ton
and you have your new skills and new
strategies and new ideas you can try and
I think it worked very well

[2:16:46]
I think it worked very well
um basically for the for my for my time
I was playing poker and I think the same
same in mtts and yeah I think I think
that's that sounds like a really really
good approach I I've never really

[2:17:00]
good approach I I've never really
thought about it that way I remember I
think we did a podcast with pats where
he also had like I think every January
or something he starts a year with like
a boot camp like that for himself where
he just red do every re re basically
redesigns strategy for for every

[2:17:17]
redesigns strategy for for every
spot hi guys Renee AKA de wo here with a

of course is the technical aspect of the
game in which I'll be explaining you all
the mechanics behind poker strategies
we'll be talking about GTO exploitive
play with an extra focus on the why

[2:17:46]
play with an extra focus on the why
behind certain strategies and why the
population has certain leaks and to
increase increase your wiim rate even
further we've recently added the River

Discord Community monthly live Q&A calls
and one-on-one coaching session in which
we are going to be reviewing if you have
been implementing the stuff that we
teach you in the mechanics of Poker
correctly so do you think you have what

[2:19:00]
correctly so do you think you have what
it takes to master the mechanics of
Poker go over to mechanics ofp poker.com
and maybe you will get a chance to work
with me and Adam and make more progress
in your poker career but for now without
further Ado let's get back into more

[2:19:15]
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode now you
mentioned and everyone knows right yeah
you should study to get better and
you've mentioned study so many times I
already wrote this question down sure
people will will want to know when you

[2:19:30]
people will will want to know when you
say
study what what do you do how how can
people study in order to to go into the
future right what should people study
how should people study and how has your
study process evolved right over over
the 15 years you've been playing

[2:19:45]
the 15 years you've been playing
poker yeah so I I listened to the couple
podcasts and
and I either saw people saying that you
cannot mimic solvers if you study
solvers is [ __ ] and yeah it's

[2:20:01]
solvers is [ __ ] and yeah it's
definitely some truth about that and
there are other players like H you have
to be like super exploitive nothing else
I basically the same but others like GTO
Wizarding on four tables four hours a

[2:20:15]
Wizarding on four tables four hours a
day or something like that and I think
it's it's not that simple either way the
like uh I definitely had my fair share
of staring 10 hours by a solver and felt

[2:20:31]
of staring 10 hours by a solver and felt
like didn't learn anything like not even
a single thing like I tried to you know
I created super St super complicated
strategies like I even wrote down okay
this combo you bet 60% or

[2:20:46]
this combo you bet 60% or
70% why would I ever do that but I think
um you definitely can study stuff which
is not useful but usually it's much more
complicated and even if you want to

[2:21:02]
complicated and even if you want to
exploit the [ __ ] out of people you you
have to be watch and look and study a
bunch of sols and just realize how
people uh think and how people play and

[2:21:16]
people uh think and how people play and
I think I was really good at modeling
these situations so
I would
definitely use solvers a lot but I would
use uh pop Tendencies as well and try to

[2:21:32]
use uh pop Tendencies as well and try to
like you know create some nice node
loocks um I didn't really like GTO
wizard because of the so many choices
you have like this you know you you do a

[2:21:46]
you have like this you know you you do a
practice and by the river you have like
a 1% range but if it got much much
better especially with this Ai and I I
started to use a lot more um I still
prefer my own SCE because it's you know

[2:22:03]
prefer my own SCE because it's you know
it's more tailored but if you want a
quick quicker answer and uh uh so so
yeah basically I I started to use both

[2:22:15]
yeah basically I I started to use both
and um yes like convenience over
accuracy right they order they give you
a quicker more convenient experience
whereas your own s for examp have the
same than in Pio there's more accuracy
because I think it's still a bit more
but like I said this could also be us uh

[2:22:31]
but like I said this could also be us uh
like falling for the Trap again right to
to start using or start optimally using
a certain software uh a bit too late
because it when you already have
everything set up in pile you know and
it's easy for you to use Easy to stick

[2:22:45]
it's easy for you to use Easy to stick
to stick to what's comfortable for you
now I do think you know uh yeah but like
I said g wizard like just the
convenience and the speed with which it
does it yeah does make it very uh so
beautiful and and I I love these games

[2:23:00]
beautiful and and I I love these games
where you can mimic your play and
actually clicking on something like
these drills and practices I use GTO
trainer as well and and The Wizard
trainer as well because it's so nice
even if you learn something and and you

[2:23:16]
even if you learn something and and you
think you know it and it's so let me
give you an example I I create a a no
look where I think people deviate from
some stuff and you get like a very very

[2:23:31]
some stuff and you get like a very very
easy solution because once you try to
exploit sometimes the solution is just
max exploit doing something like
100% so like one example if people

[2:23:45]
100% so like one example if people
overse that in forbat BS you just
basically check raise everything on the
flop
maybe lock dur gem River yeah
and even it is very very simple strategy

[2:24:00]
and even it is very very simple strategy
but the fact that you create a soul or a
a nolock and you train that like you
just basically have to click raise every
single time but you still get used to
the environment you see the cards you

[2:24:16]
the environment you see the cards you
have you see the Flop you have you see
the situation for example I I'm super uh
deep in this when I try to I when I
practice with pyot trainer I never set a

[2:24:32]
practice with pyot trainer I never set a
heads up spot when it's a small blind
big blind small blind button spot yeah I
do the same yeah it's it's a I don't
like uh feeling I'm playing a heads up I
want to feel feel the same environment I

[2:24:45]
want to feel feel the same environment I
play six Max I want to practice that so
even if I have a very simple decision I
like to practi in and see uh it's going
to be more um realistic and when you
when you're in the real game you're

[2:25:00]
when you're in the real game you're
going to recognize much more
easily um so I love those and yeah I
think I think I I just um also um when I
feel I have so much stuff to study like
we have endless stuff to study even now

[2:25:16]
we have endless stuff to study even now
like it's
basically how how do you priori
yeah um so I try to
prioritize by uh like what is more
common like probably EP MP forb spot do

[2:25:34]
common like probably EP MP forb spot do
do do flap is not that not that common
but I also like to use these Fortune of
wheel or something when you so so my my
idea is if you have too many stuff to

[2:25:47]
idea is if you have too many stuff to
study and you cannot decide then you
going to be crippled as you mentioned
before and you think oh I don't know
what to do so I just you just feel like
um you cannot even choose and you don't

[2:26:00]
um you cannot even choose and you don't
do anything so then I like to use I know
what spots I need uh practice and I just
put in this Wheel of Fortune and put a
label on it and give it a spin and then
just study
that um yeah and um I mean it's I I also

[2:26:19]
that um yeah and um I mean it's I I also
have a very good comparison between
tennis and poker what I have learned I'm
not sure have you guys played tennis or
watch Tennis sometimes do you guys know

[2:26:30]
watch Tennis sometimes do you guys know
the
rules yeah so
uh when I go for coaching we always do
like different drills and different
stuff and I feel like it's a it's not a
one game Dennis it's not like a one game

[2:26:47]
one game Dennis it's not like a one game
it's a multiple different games like if
you are at the net and doing a volley
it's so much different than doing a big
shots from from the Baseline and I think
it's the same in poker you have so many

[2:27:01]
it's the same in poker you have so many
little different games like a a button
cut of three B pot is so much different
than a small blind big blind open race
point so basically you just have to
learn all these different games and

[2:27:17]
learn all these different games and
basically it's a collection of games and
you you want to be good at the most
common little games you're going to play
and always it's going to be different a
forbat spot it's so much different you

[2:27:31]
forbat spot it's so much different you
have to you have to practice all of them
and learn the basics and even if you
even if you just look bio Sims and you
think you don't learn anything I mean
you have to have to see how it works and

[2:27:47]
you have to have to see how it works and
how how's the mechanics mechan
shout out to the mechanics yes no but
that's it right you have to go in with
that mentality of and that Curiosity of
how does this work instead of tell me
what to do that's kind of the the it's

[2:28:02]
what to do that's kind of the the it's
like really much the mentality with
which you open the solver I think you
also mentioned right that you also
misused it when you were trying to
implement okay I should bet this 60 70%
of the time and probably you kind of

[2:28:15]
of the time and probably you kind of
very quickly realize okay this is
probably not the best way that I should
use the solver you Meed the more
effective itive way of using the solver
is to compare like okay this is the
equilibrium strategy we understand why
that's its way we look at population
Tendencies put in the numbers run a not
loock I usually recommend also to maybe

[2:28:31]
loock I usually recommend also to maybe
no lock slowly because in in many spots
indeed because the equilibrium so
fragile right if we give it a couple
percent more it just says well just do
this 100% of the time so I usually like
to not exaggerate but like no loock
slowly so we can see okay what kind of

[2:28:45]
slowly so we can see okay what kind of
other firstand that that strategies
start switching with also at latest
replay we have to kind of re-evaluate
when it comes down to using data to get
a better idea of what the PO is doing
right and what the ranges are what are

[2:29:00]
right and what the ranges are what are
like effective ways to use data in your
opinion to build strategies and what are
like some traps that people should look
out for for example we talked earlier in
this conversation you had with Adam also
about biases and if feel like especially
in data there's a lot of things that can

[2:29:16]
in data there's a lot of things that can
go wrong can you maybe share your your
experience yeah so just one more thing
about the the studying and the Not
Looking uh it's funny I just came
across uh not so long ago that basically

[2:29:30]
across uh not so long ago that basically
if you start no looking some s you can
justify anything yes I I saw a video
from a guy uh doing some I I don't know
like middle position calling the three
bet with 86 suited and he's saying okay

[2:29:48]
bet with 86 suited and he's saying okay
this is a pure fold but if you put that
and that into the yeah you can see now
it's a pure call Yeah so basically
they're they're justifying their
decision right yeah yeah yeah and and he
ended up like I think stabbing the Flop

[2:30:04]
ended up like I think stabbing the Flop
stabbing the turn and step coing the
river and basically he just said okay I
don't think they protect their range so
they're gonna just be uh annoyed with

[2:30:16]
they're gonna just be uh annoyed with
Ace King and like Ace highs and start
putting like turning into Bluffs and
basically he just set everything into
the nod look the way he wanted and
obviously turned out like the super plus

[2:30:31]
obviously turned out like the super plus
CV line and I was definitely doing this
as well I just realized with an extreme
example that yeah you can you can
justify and also in GTO wizard if you if
you do drills like it's really hard to

[2:30:46]
you do drills like it's really hard to
make a big mistake like you're going to
usually have these um uh frequency plays
and and it seems like you didn't do big
mistakes but maybe you did tremendous

[2:31:00]
mistakes but maybe you did tremendous
big mistakes uh but you just can't see
it so about the
data uh it's definitely uh true that you
can I I mean there are
some uh spots where you just have to

[2:31:17]
some uh spots where you just have to
know have to learn what is a trustable
data and I don't even know how
to so sometimes I just see it in a video
and I realize it's true so let give you

[2:31:31]
and I realize it's true so let give you
example I was looking at uh pop tendency
calling in the big line and if you if
you see if you check a a huge database
you see like everything people call is

[2:31:47]
you see like everything people call is
super plus CV and I yeah the conclusion
is just you call everything because
people are not that aggressive probably
in position and you just get away with
it but then you realize that if people

[2:32:01]
it but then you realize that if people
call six4 off suits you're going to see
a showdown usually when they win like
you're not going to see the 64 suit 64
off suit when they folded on the turn so
it's going to be like the show them bias

[2:32:15]
it's going to be like the show them bias
which I wasn't aware of for a couple
years and then I realized yeah basically
the there are showdowns which can be
trusted some showdowns cannot be trusted
because of the nature of the way how it

[2:32:32]
because of the nature of the way how it
goes to
Showdown and also the uncertainty like
if you have 10 examples maybe as as Adam
said maybe it's not uh not good enough

[2:32:45]
said maybe it's not uh not good enough
or not precise enough but also you can
you can I I can't remember this uh
mathematical expression but you can
check the certainty of the number like a
bional um something and and basically

[2:33:03]
bional um something and and basically
you can you can have like a nice uh
educated guess on is this is this just a
a noise in the data or is this

[2:33:15]
a noise in the data or is this
trustful and yeah uh I I just try to
focus on the on the
useful data I remember I remember like
before solvers when basically all we had
was data or at least the game was way

[2:33:31]
was data or at least the game was way
more exploitable right because we were
mainly playing on data of other players
and you kind of making strategies on the
Fly remember like sample size issues was
like this guy had a leak and then a
month later he didn't have the leak
anymore but now I realize that probably
it was probably it was just statistical

[2:33:46]
it was probably it was just statistical
uncertainty that made the league go away
it's like oh I he had that leak oh he
doesn't have that leak anymore so yeah
there's definitely some truth in that I
do feel like there is a lot of because
poker we already have little information

[2:34:00]
poker we already have little information
and I do feel like if we get some data
that's pointing something in wrong
direction I think if we have to wait
until a confidence interval of like 95%
certainty we missed stop on a lot of
good plus of V opportunities if we
wouldn't have been that much of a knit

[2:34:16]
wouldn't have been that much of a knit
in wanting to have 100% certainty of a
stat and obviously also there's ways you
can use multiple stats at all point in
the same direction um but yeah
definitely true uh like I said I've
definitely Fallen victim of this uh
myself of ignoring kind of uh sample

[2:34:31]
myself of ignoring kind of uh sample
sizes I do also feel like in data for
example if people only let's say for
example you see a folded spot but it's a
spot where population itself under
Bluffs that means that the majority of
the times that they fac that bet it was

[2:34:46]
the times that they fac that bet it was
value heavy which blocks calling ranges
therefore full percentages will go up or
people only follow through in like
Equity improving scenarios so there's
there's a lot of like it doesn't tell
the same story like I experimented in my

[2:35:01]
the same story like I experimented in my
career as well and friends of mine as
well where you just saw one data point
you're like hey data point says so let's
go but you forget that when people
arrive in that note they're telling a
story that makes sense and I'm just now
arriving at this note with a story that
makes no sense at all and people are
like what the [ __ ] is this and they call

[2:35:16]
like what the [ __ ] is this and they call
you down like well well but the data
showed that they're over folding here
with a % what the [ __ ] is going on well
that's because I'm telling a [ __ ]
story with a [ __ ] hand so it it is
going to it is going to screw the data a
little bit ever experience anything like
this oh yeah man all the time I remember

[2:35:31]
this oh yeah man all the time I remember
one of the podcast I just saw you
talking about when people say I'm
exploiting the Flop over SE betting
because they overflow and then they turn
they going to or or river they think

[2:35:47]
they going to or or river they think
about like what going to Bluff and what
I'm going to Bluff and why I'm going to
overse that the turn as well and yeah if
you did explorative stuff on the on the
fluff like how do you think and even in

[2:36:01]
fluff like how do you think and even in
my earlier poker careers poker career I
loved when I had the reasoning that I
discounted some hands from his range on
the turn and then add back on the river

[2:36:16]
the turn and then add back on the river
like I'm going to get called by that
because I that better hand or something
and it's just completely
ridiculous yeah I definitely uh had
problems with that and and I I think I

[2:36:30]
problems with that and and I I think I
you just have to learn with the data
that some some things are not not going
to be that useful and you not you cannot
be that sure and I also saw like very

[2:36:46]
be that sure and I also saw like very
weird
examples when people overfall turn and
you do the nolock and then you realize
they still going to be over folding even
even by the river and it's just so

[2:37:00]
even by the river and it's just so
insane that you you you would think if
you did your exploitive stuff on the
Flop then it's over because it's just so
much stronger range but then you realize
oh my God they still should have called

[2:37:15]
oh my God they still should have called
like this week hands on a certain run
so it could be
really
um it could be really in
unexpected when when you work with data

[2:37:32]
unexpected when when you work with data
and uh you just you just have to be
really careful and mindful uh what you
you're going to try like I remember I
started playing heads up again um one or

[2:37:47]
started playing heads up again um one or
yeah one year ago and I just I just met
the guy who was like so freaking
aggressive I just decided that you you
can call down this guy with anything and

[2:38:00]
can call down this guy with anything and
it would be okay and then I just call
down second pair worse kicker like even
blocking his Bluffs like 250 big blind
deep and of course he was just very
betting super thin and I got destroyed

[2:38:16]
betting super thin and I got destroyed
and you you have to be really careful
about even how how sick you're going to
exploit
because if somebody sees you doing that
big of an adjustment they they're going

[2:38:31]
big of an adjustment they they're going
to just stop do it and and you they're
going to crush you so it's many many
times it's not just simple that you just
change in one or zero or a or b i

[2:38:45]
change in one or zero or a or b i
remember um the Stefan challenge again
against toti
88 and I think toti had this same
attitude I had many times that okay
Stefan equals bluffing all the time what

[2:39:01]
Stefan equals bluffing all the time what
should I do call call all the time it's
it it's way more difficult than that and
you just you just cannot call
down second pairs on a on a flush

[2:39:15]
down second pairs on a on a flush
present stuff like that so you have to
be really really careful
and uh I I was watching the your podcast
with Matt marinell and if you check his
graph and and stuff like that he he

[2:39:30]
graph and and stuff like that he he
looks like the most exploited people
person you can imagine and it was
interesting from him hearing that he
tries
to exploit like very slowly like bit by

[2:39:45]
to exploit like very slowly like bit by
bit and yeah I think it it makes sense
it there are some rare rare occasions
when you can go full exploit but usually
you have to be careful because you you
never
know uh and and yeah with the data is

[2:40:01]
know uh and and yeah with the data is
the same I think you have to be really
careful especially when it's something
on the River on a single Ray spot like
three three after three bar your
Showdown is going to be I mean much less

[2:40:15]
Showdown is going to be I mean much less
um compar Rel yeah reliable yeah you
also mentioned that next to studing you
have throughout your poke career worked
with various coaches I heard you
mentioned Paul AO AKA internet Tyler
forer AKA go NOS if I'm not mistaken

[2:40:31]
forer AKA go NOS if I'm not mistaken
right that was his nickname yeah legend
legend on Poké star days uh what were
like the do you remember any like big
aha moments that either internet or Mr
go NOS taught you that you were like oh
wow this really changed the way I I look

[2:40:46]
wow this really changed the way I I look
at
poker yeah yeah
um maybe not like super big aha moments
but the way how different can a person
think with the same game like I remember

[2:41:02]
think with the same game like I remember
with Paul I had this uh so basically I I
told him okay let's do a coaching I want
to be the best poker player ever and
what should I do super easy question and

[2:41:16]
what should I do super easy question and
he started with a like a notepad and
saying like who's going to make the most
money in poker like okay first is the
poker site and then second is the uh the
sponsored poker player and uh you know

[2:41:33]
sponsored poker player and uh you know
like doing a sheet for me I would never
even think about I would just consider
the the how I play or what should I do
on the river so he he started from like

[2:41:46]
on the river so he he started from like
a very different perspective and U for a
similar idea I heard a friend of mine
got coachings from OTA I think he's a
famous entity player the Canadian guy uh

[2:42:03]
famous entity player the Canadian guy uh
not 100% it was him but I think it was
him the first session yeah the first
session he had he said you shouldn't get
let yourself buttoning that much and and

[2:42:16]
let yourself buttoning that much and and
turned out he lost like
3,000 by grimming because other players
just play the button and leave and I
mean who what kind of Coach looks so
deep into your database I would I would

[2:42:32]
deep into your database I would I would
never even find it even in my own
database like so people can think so
differently about the stuff and I think
it was the same with
Tyler
um he he was thinking about stuff I

[2:42:47]
um he he was thinking about stuff I
would never realize myself I mean I I
I'm not like I cannot even give like a a
perfect example I try to think one but
it was basically just the just the way

[2:43:03]
it was basically just the just the way
he was approaching uh the game and
poker and um also I think he played a
lot of ignition or bod or something and

[2:43:17]
lot of ignition or bod or something and
there was a very different
different hand history I'm sure you know
they you cannot so it's anonym tables
but yeah you can see for one days you
can see hul cart so he had like a

[2:43:31]
can see hul cart so he had like a
completely
different
um experience with the showdowns like I
I never saw full showdowns in my life
where I was playing so he had a lot of
insights and I think maybe poker detox

[2:43:47]
insights and I think maybe poker detox
started with the same um concept so
obviously it's a very useful thing and I
couldn't play Boda or ignition ever from
Hungary so it was a new thing for me and

[2:44:01]
Hungary so it was a new thing for me and
it's very funny when you say see
actually people uh folding some good
hands and you would never see you could
you could guess that you never see these
top pairs in three bad pots at Showdown

[2:44:17]
top pairs in three bad pots at Showdown
so they fold it but you never can be
certain so it was nice to see uh full
whole cards but yeah usually usually it
was because they were thinking about

[2:44:30]
was because they were thinking about
stuff or or studying stuff I wouldn't
even study or and they also it's also
seems like that they look they zoomed
out further for example you might come
to a problem or student might post a

[2:44:45]
to a problem or student might post a
hand where it's like I'm In this River
decision and my response might might be
like why were you in this game in the
first place something like that you know
or like people like to focus on like oh
should I call this River check race now

[2:45:01]
should I call this River check race now
I'm like like we should have maybe
checked the Flop and this whole scenario
that we're now discussing for the next
half hour it's just all an aspl scenario
which we should just never get in again
a lot of a lot of discussions in poker
are around as like to call them aspl

[2:45:15]
are around as like to call them aspl
scenarios where they just steered the
hand into a part of the tree where it's
like yeah this is a very shitty spot you
want you want to know the solution and
then they think for example that me or
maybe you we have the answer I'm like my
answer is I will prevent getting into
this spot by not having played the head

[2:45:30]
this spot by not having played the head
to where you did
it right now I'm I'm right now I'm as
[ __ ] as you right but I will try to be
in this situation the least as possible
all right but this spot is indeed a
nasty spot could this spot have been
prevented by either and like I said this

[2:45:46]
prevented by either and like I said this
can be early in the tree or by not
sitting down at thisable versus this guy
in the first place you know if we go
even even for a more zoomed out
perspective like you you labeled
yourself a bit as a as a scientist right

[2:46:00]
yourself a bit as a as a scientist right
um what are like some of the most
controvertial strategies you've
experimented with over the last 15 years
do do any stand out where like okay I
tried this for a little while I I guess
lately you hear less and less about

[2:46:16]
lately you hear less and less about
these crazy strategies and ideas
but I
remember probably it's better if I don't
say any names but there was this
Hungarian guy who was opening like 90

[2:46:30]
Hungarian guy who was opening like 90
plus per on the button and doing doing
crazy stuff and usually it came down to
people thinking they are very good and
others are stupid like I definitely had
this problem too like thinking about

[2:46:46]
this problem too like thinking about
thinking about professional po players
like oh this guy is just stupid I mean
he's been playing poker for eight years
he's clearly not stupid uh so my friend
took some I think bought from him 10hour

[2:47:04]
took some I think bought from him 10hour
coaching in a pack and this guy just he
was just saying oh you can open 90% on
the button 45% on the cut off and and

[2:47:16]
the button 45% on the cut off and and
see everything and and he was saying
like ridiculous claims and my friend U
did like two sessions and it was
terrible and he said okay I just don't
want to continue this and um he said

[2:47:34]
want to continue this and um he said
okay just stop this maybe send back the
money and I think the the guy was not
even sending back the money and uh my
friend just said okay I don't even care

[2:47:46]
friend just said okay I don't even care
I I don't even care if you don't send
back the money but I don't need the
coachings cuz it was so bad and the same
guy had a I think a coaching group and
by the way in his defense I think for

[2:48:02]
by the way in his defense I think for
him it was actually working uh but in
the same way he couldn't really
explain why did it work for him and not
for others and I think he had also

[2:48:16]
for others and I think he had also
coaching group when uh tried to teach
people play like that but they couldn't
and there were very funny conversations
about his students they were saying like

[2:48:30]
about his students they were saying like
yeah these guys are just these Rags are
so stupid you can do whatever you want
and but eventually they never succeeded
with this um I mean you can also
understand that if you send out a bunch
of horses opening 90% of the button like

[2:48:47]
of horses opening 90% of the button like
may maybe you can get away with did but
to implement that as like a mass
strategy for a stable we have to
consider uh we have to consider some
consequences yeah but uh there are very
controversial strategies with you you

[2:49:03]
controversial strategies with you you
maybe not even realize so
even I had this mistake that I was
playing many poker rooms many poker
tables and already had like 5,000 hands

[2:49:15]
tables and already had like 5,000 hands
on a guy and then I just realized he
three bets
32% big blind versus small blind and I
never noticed it I'm like what the hell
how did I not notice it so sometimes
there people have like super crazy

[2:49:31]
there people have like super crazy
strategies and you don't even realize it
and they could go undercover for a very
long time
especially ER if something
needs uh very high risk so for an easy

[2:49:48]
needs uh very high risk so for an easy
example or if somebody for for bed
Bluffs you all the time like when you
jam your good hands they're going to
just fold and if they have good hands
they're going to call and it's even if

[2:50:02]
they're going to call and it's even if
you know they bluffing a lot you have to
jam like weak whole St yeah yeah and and
it you can run bad with that he can
easily have like a couple good hands and

[2:50:16]
easily have like a couple good hands and
also it can happen the opposite way like
live you feel this guy forets me four
times in a row and you just jam on him
and turns out he he would never even
forbid Bluff he just had a uh good run

[2:50:33]
forbid Bluff he just had a uh good run
so I think
um there are still very
surprisingly uh super exploitive
strategies uh so sometimes I see a

[2:50:47]
strategies uh so sometimes I see a
player have 30 plus per check rat on the
Flop but you don't see that very often
so sometimes you it just goes
unnotice yeah that's true and like you
said for for certain stat as well you

[2:51:01]
said for for certain stat as well you
know you need quite a sample for it uh
to start to actually pay attention to it
um you I think since you know you've
you've been you've been playing for a
long time and you grew up before the
solver eight sort to say what do you

[2:51:16]
solver eight sort to say what do you
think are like some skills from
players like yourself me Adam like we
all grew up in in that area what are
kind of some skills that we learned back
in the day that still gives us an Adge

[2:51:30]
in the day that still gives us an Adge
today that maybe the new school players
who straight away grew up with solvers
kind of
miss this is a really hard question
because that was exactly my thought when
I heard somebody just started playing

[2:51:47]
I heard somebody just started playing
poker couple years ago and playing high
staks and I just didn't add up for me
like if I think about my whole journey I
did so many I watched so many videos in

[2:52:02]
did so many I watched so many videos in
YouTube I just so many hands so many
experience like how can this guy
accumulate that much experience in such
a short period of time but then my

[2:52:15]
a short period of time but then my
friend pointed out that they they didn't
have have to go over the the guessing
phase where you don't know what you have
to do and you just seven back Bluff with
king queen because you have no idea and

[2:52:30]
king queen because you have no idea and
you you just think the others bluffing
and you you pull those random lines and
yeah I it's really hard because you're
asking the
opposite and I would say that just

[2:52:45]
opposite and I would say that just
experience and and we had so much
different games and different situations
but that would like Phil hel would say
to the online Grinders that he had such

[2:53:01]
to the online Grinders that he had such
a big experience and everything and and
yet I don't think he's even close to a
good online player because they just
accumulated experience so much faster
and so much more precise it's really

[2:53:17]
and so much more precise it's really
really hard to to combat that yeah they
they they they didn't develop maybe
certain bad habits exactly we had to now
overcome right and like old ways the old
old flawed ways of approaching poker

[2:53:31]
old flawed ways of approaching poker
that they didn't really fall for because
they knew it straight away from the
start and also nowadays it's more about
playing a good strategy whereas in the
in the past it was more like a mind game
right you're trying to gra get into the
mind of the other guy exactly the

[2:53:45]
mind of the other guy exactly the
feelings were they so present like but
what you felt and you suspected and you
try to you know [ __ ] over the other guy
with some strategic option and yeah your
feelings dictated your decisions and

[2:54:01]
feelings dictated your decisions and
turns out maybe some
spots so your so your conclusion is that
uh we we we have gained no we've gained
no Edge by by have start having start
back in definitely definitely not that

[2:54:16]
back in definitely definitely not that
um probably
bankr management and money management
and life like we talked about a lot of
stuff which is maybe not even helpful
for poker so let's say I

[2:54:31]
for poker so let's say I
do uh meditation I do good
food U fasting diet uh be careful
exercising I'm not 100% sure if you are

[2:54:46]
exercising I'm not 100% sure if you are
against a guy who's playing 15 hours a
day home and studying and not even just
sitting not even working out not even
doing not eating pizza all day I'm not
even sure if you could outperform him

[2:55:02]
even sure if you could outperform him
because he just have so much passion to
the game and so much time um so what
what we do is is more like not just

[2:55:16]
what we do is is more like not just
poker but health and and the whole
thing together like a very good balance
and sometimes if you're very very good
at one thing but the only thing you're
good at it's going to hurt you very bad
later um so I don't think that's the

[2:55:32]
later um so I don't think that's the
right way but if you think about just
poker wise it's very hard to compete
against who somebody who just allocates
much more time to uh this stuff Jesus
somebody's honking Buddha best traffic

[2:55:49]
somebody's honking Buddha best traffic
yeah yeah no so so I I agree and it's
also probably you would outperform in on
longevity right because obviously what
he's doing is less SST sustainable I do
feel like like like you said and it's

[2:56:02]
feel like like like you said and it's
probably part of it as well right you
your experience and realizing that we're
humans I think they see the game maybe
sometimes a bit too static and too
robotic and they don't realize that they
are a human that needs taken care of
right and they're playing against humans

[2:56:16]
right and they're playing against humans
who have certain flaws certain certain
that there there's just certain spots
probably even more so in life poker like
yeah this this guy just always has it or
never has it and they feel to think they
they feel to think in that type of way

[2:56:32]
they feel to think in that type of way
and they would just be like oh what do
you mean this is my strategy and it's
it's not it's not that that's not
correct right it's just a different way
of approaching the game that in certain
scenarios uh uh will be superior but

[2:56:46]
scenarios uh uh will be superior but
yeah I definitely obviously agree that
the later used started the big the
bigger Advantage you have I was just
curious if there was something that you
think would still be able to give you an
edge you also mentioned that you've
obviously invested a lot of coaching you

[2:57:00]
obviously invested a lot of coaching you
also did some coaching yourself in your
experience what is like the most common
leaks you see amongst like midak Players
let's say and how should they go about
fixing
them I I saw I've seen many many

[2:57:16]
them I I saw I've seen many many
different mistakes
[Music]
um
uh I I I met so many different people
like I met very very smart guys I think

[2:57:32]
like I met very very smart guys I think
way smarter than me and love to
study and uh they just hate grinding and
they don't like to grind they don't
grind they they don't like the variant

[2:57:45]
grind they they don't like the variant
and uh it's really very that how many
different things you need to have to be
a successful poker player like uh maybe
you would be the best fker player but
you just don't like doing it and and

[2:58:02]
you just don't like doing it and and
other guys just love to grind they grind
300 hours even a month if they have to
but they hate to study they can't study
they don't
study
um I had a funny coaching when a guy it

[2:58:16]
um I had a funny coaching when a guy it
was like 10 years ago go maybe even more
the guy started the coaching that uh
showing me a hand and I'm like okay
let's see this hand I think preflop and
then he cuts me off like okay don't talk

[2:58:32]
then he cuts me off like okay don't talk
about preflop I know everything about
preflop just let's focus on post flop
situations I'm like what you you clearly
don't know and
U it's um yeah it wasn't a long

[2:58:49]
U it's um yeah it wasn't a long
it was in the long coach session yeah I
can imagine
yeah I I think
um the most common mistakes are either

[2:59:01]
um the most common mistakes are either
of these two like not studying at
all or or just studying but not doesn't
like to grind so it's it's so weird uh
and um

[2:59:17]
and um
maybe
there
are other mistakes when people are
actually pretty good and study and play
as well but they just play the worst
tables possible and uh they they think

[2:59:33]
tables possible and uh they they think
you just have to baffle all the time and
you just be better than others but
actually they not better than others and
and they have to realize so it's there

[2:59:45]
and they have to realize so it's there
so many points where you can go wrong
with poker and and uh you don't even
realize that what you're doing wrong and
actually when you even if you're really
good but playing bad tables it's going
to destroy your um your mentality and

[3:00:03]
to destroy your um your mentality and
your motivation and also we talked about
if you're doing a Las Vegas summer like
if if you grind online mtts you you do a
Sunday you play 15 tournaments maybe 20

[3:00:17]
Sunday you play 15 tournaments maybe 20
tournaments
you bust all no no itm next day you're
fine you forget about it and that's it
but when you play Live Las Vegas you
bust 20 tournaments that's like 25 days

[3:00:31]
bust 20 tournaments that's like 25 days
or 20 days in a row feeling miserable
and losing every single day it hits you
much differently than losing for one day
but it's also like 20 tournaments it's
nothing but you

[3:00:45]
nothing but you
you um feel it much more differently and
I think that's a very common mistake
that people miss some part of the of the
very simple Basics I gave just study

[3:01:00]
very simple Basics I gave just study
hard play hard play a lot do both and
you you have to do it uh a lot and if
you're missing one of them maybe 10 15
years ago if you don't study and you are

[3:01:15]
years ago if you don't study and you are
a genius you can just play maybe even
now there are some guys who can just
play but uh most of us just have to
study have to understand the game better
and have you have to game select and
these all are very very complex things

[3:01:30]
these all are very very complex things
that like you said even the game
selecting is not just simple that there
is a weak player and I sit there is so
much complexity like if you just see the
rake structure there are situations when

[3:01:45]
rake structure there are situations when
a very small losing uh
[Music]
recreational on your right is not worth
it but like five times higher limit even
with much better players you would get a
200 hour table

[3:02:02]
200 hour table
MH yeah so it comes back to like again
like a little bit more bigger picture
longterm thinking of your wiim rate and
I think to to go back to what we talked
about in terms of what maybe new school
and what you said well the experience

[3:02:16]
and what you said well the experience
this I think a lot of things that you
learn through experience right this is
not something that the solver can teach
you per
se yeah definitely and with my example
that these newcomers who just couple

[3:02:32]
that these newcomers who just couple
started couple years ago and playing
high stakes I didn't mean as
a that's easier rot for them I just
explained some of

[3:02:46]
explained some of
the new Commerce uh playing high stakes
I I still think it's very rare and our
advantage having a huge many years
experience is still very tough to

[3:03:00]
experience is still very tough to
overcome
so so even if it felt like a
disadvantage to us I think it's still an
advantage and of course there are
exceptions but usually people have to
have to have huge experiences many

[3:03:17]
have to have huge experiences many
histor is many plays many hours studying
they they cannot just know everything
yeah managing your career managing your
life managing your
emotions yeah exactly and so many things

[3:03:30]
emotions yeah exactly and so many things
can go in the can come on on the way and
um yeah you you maybe have issues in
your personal life and then it's hard to
uh focus on
[Music]

[3:03:46]
[Music]
poker um
Yeah so basically I I spoke about the
the mistakes they make in a more more
broad way not like a no but these if
these are indeed like the the biggest
mistakes that you see then obviously

[3:04:00]
mistakes that you see then obviously
that's uh yeah and also it's very very
it's much more complicated
to be um be a professional poker player
now because there's so many uh coaching
groups

[3:04:15]
groups
staes it's usually when people ask me
about like maybe on Instagram that hey I
saw you a professional poker player how
can I be a professional poker player
what should I do I'm very hesitant to

[3:04:30]
what should I do I'm very hesitant to
what should I answer like usually I I
tell the truth that look it's it's much
more different now it's very very
difficult I'm not saying I'm I'm never I
never say it's impossible but I say it's

[3:04:46]
never say it's impossible but I say it's
it's very very very
tight uh area now if you want to be good
it's very very hard work very long work
maybe not going to win any money for one
or two years maybe you need a coaching

[3:05:03]
or two years maybe you need a coaching
group it's not like 15 years ago where
you just hop on the train and you just
play anywhere you want now I would say
like some sort of coaching nowadays is
uh is

[3:05:15]
uh is
definitely yeah NE necessary I I would
say it's it has become indeed a
necessity I would say the same if
someone says oh poker and they have no
experience so they're actual complete
beginners I say don't don't do it don't
do it like you know if they're at least
already Grinders you know they're

[3:05:31]
already Grinders you know they're
already playing 100l 50l and they want
to and they're thinking like you know
they're they're winning and they're
combining it or like the study is over
and they're thinking about getting a job
or should it give a shot at this poker
thing I would say hey man give it a shot
but like if if you know nothing about

[3:05:46]
but like if if you know nothing about
poker yeah I would say no
don't there's probably other things you
can do uh that are probably more more
worth your time Adam like um alsoo
talked a lot about like problems of
people studying too much or maybe

[3:06:01]
people studying too much or maybe
studying too little from your experience
working with players especially also
from like a more mental game perspective
what do you think are like some
underlying causes that make them
overstudy or make them

[3:06:15]
overstudy or make them
underplay well I think first of all most
people under study I think I remember
pad saying probably 95% of players
understudy and the 5% who study enough
10 9% of them study too much so we've
got 95% under study in and then 90% of
the last 5% study too much so you got 1%

[3:06:31]
the last 5% study too much so you got 1%
roughly who've got the kind of optimal
balance between studying enough to to
move forward so why do people have
problems with studying so we we'll touch
on it from the not studying enough to be
honest like a lot of it is they enjoy
grinding more than studying and as we

[3:06:46]
grinding more than studying and as we
talking about in the conversation you
get the ROI from grinding you can just
jump straight in you know exactly what
you want to do you get the stimulation
straight away with studying sometimes
you're like what should I study today
what what should I be doing a lot of
players aren't organized I I've had so
many conversations like probably

[3:07:00]
many conversations like probably
hundreds thousands with players saying I
want to study more I want to study more
and as soon as we start breaking it down
it's like they don't prioritize their
studying like we're talking about time
blocking your day in the same way they
prioritize their grinding so yeah I
think not stud in is more of a problem
than over stud in like you said you get

[3:07:16]
than over stud in like you said you get
the other players who go to for studying
they want certainty they like the the
challenge of learning things but then
the insecurity of playing because when
you study a lot you get very good in
knowledge but then you need to execute
that knowledge and guess what mistakes
insecurity not not getting good feedback

[3:07:31]
insecurity not not getting good feedback
oh that didn't feel nice oh just lost a
Buy in oh it feels nice just going back
to the to the lab and studying this
stuff so you get this kind of Disconnect
between wanting to learn and W to
execute so uh yeah it's it's tough like
it's tough to find that balance between
studying enough and um yeah not studying

[3:07:46]
studying enough and um yeah not studying
too much so I think as you mentioned
throughout the conversation trying to
find that like in a 90-minute study I
think most players could study an hour
to 90 minutes a day finding a way to
have a deep study block if you do that
six seven days a week like you're going
to be so far ahead like in a few years

[3:08:00]
to be so far ahead like in a few years
time because not many players are
consistent enough with their study in so
yeah it's a tough one to unpack but I
think the those are some of the reasons
I would I would touch on yeah I wanted
to go back to something you mentioned
which I thought was really important you
said when R kind of questioned you on
the kind of skills of the old school

[3:08:16]
the kind of skills of the old school
players compared to new school players
is you said like the package of skills
to be successful so complicated there
there so many things that come into m a
successful poker player this reminds me
like early in my career it's probably
three years in me and my two my friends
we having good success so we're like all
right we'll trade up our other friends

[3:08:30]
right we'll trade up our other friends
to be successful po players super easy
and then as we started go through the
process we like okay we'll teach them
the strategy execute this how can it go
wrong and we quickly realize this isn't
working this isn't like their ability to
execute and spoons for strategy wasn't
working their ability to take risk their

[3:08:46]
working their ability to take risk their
mindset their emotions that were coming
up up what there was so many factors
that came into it which kind of at the
time was really eye opening to me now
it's much more simple but there so many
things I was like ah being a poker
player isn't just no strategy execute
there's a lot of skills that come into
it so the question I want to ask you

[3:09:00]
it so the question I want to ask you
you've had 15 years of kind of building
your your toolkit so to speak so what
package of skills would you say you've
built skills habits we could call as
well to be a successful poker player we
can go very slowly that's tough question
to uh unpack but like you mentioned
studying playing bankroll Management try

[3:09:17]
studying playing bankroll Management try
to unpack some of the the package of
skills that have allowed you to be
successful in
poker yeah I think a good realization
was uh if you are playing poker for 15

[3:09:31]
was uh if you are playing poker for 15
years you always get lost in the so I'm
sure you remember when you started
playing poker like oh my God you're you
want to do this every hour every day you

[3:09:45]
want to do this every hour every day you
are so pumped you just want to do it
it's So Fresh So new it's such a good
feeling and over 15 years you're going
to lose this so many times and you think
after 10 years like what could change
like it's just so boring you're doing

[3:10:02]
like it's just so boring you're doing
the same thing over and over again uh so
for many people it just feels like work
I have to grind six hours I just have to
maybe the same I felt sometimes with
meditation but they just they just just

[3:10:17]
meditation but they just they just just
think they have to get done with this
and and then they can do whatever they
want and I had this
and people say it's oh it's like the you
you love the game so it's easy for you

[3:10:31]
you love the game so it's easy for you
because you can't wait to play again
when you're vacation and stuff stuff
like that it's kind of true but I had
the same feelings like I hated the game
I got bored of the game it's everything
the same so I think what worked for me

[3:10:49]
the same so I think what worked for me
is using studying as a tool to to just
fell in love with the game again so if
you find a spot where you're very weak
and you start to understand that spot

[3:11:02]
and you start to understand that spot
and practice and realize what you did
wrong and what should you do and you
just basically you can create new
strategies very easily if you if you

[3:11:15]
strategies very easily if you if you
don't know a spot I think for me it was
many years the small blind big blind
spot I always studied button big blind I
always studied three bad parts and I
never really studied small blind big

[3:11:30]
never really studied small blind big
blind because yeah you know sometimes
other people limp other people just open
Rays all the time I mean it's just let's
let's study something else and it's like
one of the most common situation and
it's completely different than other

[3:11:45]
it's completely different than other
spots so when I have like I I try to
create some kind
of thesis like I would I would study for
University and uh let's say just go one

[3:12:00]
University and uh let's say just go one
by one like very simple steps I I check
one flop I just try to you know get a
framework what to do with what types and
what like the the basic rules I can use

[3:12:15]
what like the the basic rules I can use
and then I have a complete sheet like
one or two pages of like basic stuff and
it's I can check other flops and I can
see that oh this stuff works here too
it's very similar and then I use this to

[3:12:32]
it's very similar and then I use this to
just love the game again and I can't
wait to just experience it and and play
again and sometimes it you even have
to maybe the good word is to to shift

[3:12:46]
to maybe the good word is to to shift
your thinking like like you have to you
you try to feel like a brand new poker
player again like you have to be thirsty
for the knowledge and you have to be
like um pumped for the for the situation

[3:13:02]
like um pumped for the for the situation
and uh when when you start a new session
you can wrote down just a few things you
you want to focus because it's going to
be so complicated session so many things
can happen but is you you write down

[3:13:15]
can happen but is you you write down
okay I realize this and that in small
bind big blind spot I'm just going to
focus on that and let's see and then you
have something to grab on and something
to focus on and it worked me really
really well that sometimes I felt like

[3:13:31]
really well that sometimes I felt like
oh I don't even want to play again
because it's just so boring and then
switched my thinking and uh learned some
new stuff and I just oh my God I just
want to play eight hours and it works
and so good to see I think you just

[3:13:47]
and so good to see I think you just
shared the K longevity right there and
it's you mentioned studying to fall in
love with the game and always keeping
the Mind curious trying to learn new
things and as you mentioned like it's
not always that every day you wake up
you love poker you want to play

[3:14:00]
you love poker you want to play
sometimes you've got to consciously
direct yourself to do some kind of hard
studying to re-engage the mind we
mentioned year after year and you've
constantly found ways to continue to
study to uh yeah kind of re-engage that
kind of love affair as you mentioned as
well like early in your career first

[3:14:15]
well like early in your career first
probably one to three years honeymoon
period it's amazing game so interesting
so fun and all of a sudden it's like oh
yeah I kind of know a lot about poker
it's quite a same same game so to speak
and now you got to challenge yourself to
constantly keep that beginner's mindset
what's new what can I learn so it's
amazing that you're 15 years in and
you're still thinking that way you're

[3:14:30]
you're still thinking that way you're
still trying to find those novel things
to learn to improve on and I think as
humans when we we've got something new
that we're trying to uh learn about or
execute it just engages the mind in a
very different way and we feel engaged
what we're doing and I think as you get
further in your career you just got to
make sure that stays going it keep keeps

[3:14:46]
make sure that stays going it keep keeps
alive so yeah it's a very very good
hacked longevity there to um use study
to keep falling in love with the game so
as we we going for this conversation
I've been trying to like kind of skill
stack your kind of package of skills so
I'll just go for the ones I've wrote
down and we'll see if any ones you can
add so one is studying hard continue to

[3:15:00]
add so one is studying hard continue to
have that hard studied approach playing
a lot as well alongside your studying
good bank rle management learning the
bank rle management approaches that work
with you alongside that risk tolerance
knowing your risk tolerance and trying
to work on that if you're trying to move
up Stakes game selecting well
consistency when you're not feeling like

[3:15:16]
consistency when you're not feeling like
working you still work as you just
mentioned now we going to continue to
put in the work year after year learning
how to learn this is this includes
systems of learning but also the desire
to learn as you mentioned like when I
look at like the young kids who rise
quickly what have they got an edge on
just the desire to want to learn the

[3:15:30]
just the desire to want to learn the
desire to put hours after hours after
hours back to back with not thinking
that is that's a good skill set so those
they get Edge in that department they
might go out of balance but it's a it's
a real good skill to have that desire to
want to learn emotional regulation a
skill of being able to manage your
feelings as you mentioned we mentioned

[3:15:45]
feelings as you mentioned we mentioned
dealing with the Survivor B that's going
on I think focus and energy optimization
we've mentioned morning routines and
things that Prime yourself but how do
you show up and focus in the right way
so they kind of the skills I think I've
unpacked from what you've been seeing
and the skills you've been perfecting
anything that I've missed or anything

[3:16:00]
anything that I've missed or anything
else you feel that's important for your
success as a PO
player yeah uh yeah I have a good one uh
also just one more thing about the the
sping love in the in the game and
studying so if you if if you don't study

[3:16:17]
studying so if you if if you don't study
for a very long time studying feels like
the least last thing you want to do and
uh if if you think about when you go to
the gym and many people just hate doing
legs it's just pain in the ass they do

[3:16:31]
legs it's just pain in the ass they do
anything to skip the legs but when you
force yourself to do legs like five uh
for five weeks five times or something
you actually start loving it because you

[3:16:45]
you actually start loving it because you
get better at this and and you and and I
think it's very much the same with
learning it's also not just helps you to
learn the game again because you KN you
know much more stuff but you also start
to love and enjoying studying because

[3:17:02]
to love and enjoying studying because
you always first you have you know your
your walls when you don't feel you learn
anything but then you learn something
and it feels so much better and you
start loving studying as well and it

[3:17:15]
start loving studying as well and it
goes back and forth when I don't study
for a long time um I I feel like I don't
want to study but then I start studying
again and I realize I learned much from
that then I start loving it
again um and I was about to say

[3:17:33]
again um and I was about to say
something
else um yeah also
motivation I had many friends who were
good poker players smart love the game

[3:17:46]
good poker players smart love the game
of not loving the game but like okay but
they didn't have any motivation so for
example they would not even buy thems a
new shoe new pair of shoes

[3:18:01]
new shoe new pair of shoes
like one one of my friend would say oh
why would I
spend hundred bucks on a shoe and he
what he was doing he he was never ever
um um how do you say

[3:18:17]
um um how do you say
uh gave a present to himself for
achieving something so for me it I mean
I was always a I always dreamed about a
nice house I always dreamed about cars I

[3:18:32]
nice house I always dreamed about cars I
always had these goals in my mind I I
want to have this and that and uh when
you when you get something it obviously
feels like an egoistic dream and a and a

[3:18:46]
feels like an egoistic dream and a and a
m realistic stuff but it it also you
have
something you can basically even touch
and it's the the result of your of
your grind and your many years so I

[3:19:03]
your grind and your many years so I
always had this and and um even like
cars I I I love cars and and um when I
was a kid I saw like uh movies with like

[3:19:17]
was a kid I saw like uh movies with like
Ferraris and Lamborghinis and stuff and
I was like oh my God I I just want to
feel that and see how it's going to be
and U yeah it's it was super big
motivation that I had uh

[3:19:34]
motivation that I had uh
even materialistic goals in my head not
just Financial Freedom and and and the
same with the traveling my some of my
friends they were just never traveling

[3:19:45]
friends they were just never traveling
they didn't even care and uh I think you
can easily burn out when you you don't
have to be uh giving yourself a present
by a you know a fancy vacation or the or
a fancy car or anything but you have to

[3:20:03]
a fancy car or anything but you have to
have something
you um you give as a priz your to
yourself I
think yeah I think it's important to
have an aspiration to strive towards so

[3:20:16]
have an aspiration to strive towards so
as you mentioned like motivation to move
towards something if you think about
human nature like why would we work hard
why would we make ourselves do stuff
it's always to get somewhere or it get
them at the end of it often the the
shortterm pain is for like the long-term
future so if we don't have something

[3:20:31]
future so if we don't have something
longterm to aim for whether it's a car
house uh Financial Freedom or just
feeling sense of fulfillment we're
always going to go for the path of least
resistance which often means Netflix
YouTube eating the wrong foods and it's
very easy get sucked into that trap so
as you're alluding there you had friends

[3:20:46]
as you're alluding there you had friends
who didn't have the motivation to move
towards something so they're always
struggling it's interesting I think a
lot of people spend way too much time on
discipline like self discipline that's
like kind of a popular topic I don't
really believe in self-d discipline at
all because if you look at disciplined

[3:21:00]
all because if you look at disciplined
people they're not making themselves do
stuff so discipline is like a whip make
myself do it make myself do that make
myself do that whereas if you have
aspirations like a desire or purpose or
something you're moving towards you do
the disciplin behaviors because they're
T you to your goal it looks like
discipline but it's not it's like the
person who's motivated like Kobe

[3:21:15]
person who's motivated like Kobe
Bryant's a great example and be player
and he would get up at 3:00 in the
morning and go to the gym why because he
want to be the best basketball player in
the world someone go wow that's so
disciplined he was like I can't not the
alarm's off and I've got to get up got
to go to the gym there's a difference
between desire towards stuff so I think
for you you've tapped into uh motivating

[3:21:31]
for you you've tapped into uh motivating
behaviors or things you want to achieve
things you want to experience whether
it's cars or other experiences but it's
it's tapping into I'm moving towards
this and I will do these actions to move
in that direction so it's tapping into
that kind of those drivers which I think
is really
important all right question final

[3:21:46]
important all right question final
question from me I want you to uh go
back to your younger self we'll go 15
years in the past that time when you
just blew your role playing heads up and
you're going for a run in the rain
yourself today is going to run alongside
your younger self what advice would you

[3:22:00]
your younger self what advice would you
give to that younger self that you wish
had known when you were starting
out yeah
um I think it would be definitely the
time travel example like don't focus on

[3:22:15]
time travel example like don't focus on
the past and
be annoyed that you didn't start earlier
but focus on what can you learn um and I
would
definitely urge myself to just study

[3:22:30]
definitely urge myself to just study
more and understand the game better
because it's just gonna makes your make
your life much more easier like it it's
going to be even if you think you have
to earn this and that much of money on

[3:22:46]
to earn this and that much of money on
and if if you don't do it then you
cannot continue your poker career you're
going to end up saving so much
time and um other thing I would say
is quite hard

[3:23:01]
is quite hard
because you you always think like oh I
have to grind so hard I I'm just GNA
grind 12 hours it's good games I'm going
to stay in the game and wreck my sleep
and wreck my health

[3:23:16]
and wreck my health
and I can
sacrifice and uh when I started po
playing poker there were still debates
on the sleeping stuff like you could
hear quotes from Arnold schwarzer that

[3:23:31]
hear quotes from Arnold schwarzer that
you you sleep enough in your grave and
you you don't need sleep you have to
achieve your goals you don't care about
sleep and this grind culture even Gary
ve who I really like but he says like oh

[3:23:46]
ve who I really like but he says like oh
[ __ ] the sleep you you go 200 hour grind
and I think you just you just perform so
much better if you get a good sleep and
good health obviously sometimes there

[3:24:00]
good health obviously sometimes there
there is a little bit of tradeoffs maybe
you think your it's it's your one and
only chance like the biggest best game
you ever had but chances are it's not so
I would I would say to myself to to just

[3:24:16]
I would I would say to myself to to just
be
well
rested have a a routine like you don't
have to sacrifice your days and weeks
for for a grind it's really hard for MTT
players I

[3:24:30]
players I
know um and
also uh yeah bankroll management but I
think it was kind of inevitable for me
to to go broke with the because I just
didn't know anything about it so even

[3:24:47]
didn't know anything about it so even
maybe even if I go back in time and tell
myself maybe I I still have to
experience it to understand it so these
are really tough questions but I think
these would be the suggestions to myself

[3:25:03]
these would be the suggestions to myself
great answer yeah I think it's hard to
go back because you understand the
lessons you went through were kind of
needed to get to where you are but also
there like it's kind of like shortcut
like a cheat code if I go back and just
like miss those two ones out and go
through so you mention like studying

[3:25:15]
through so you mention like studying
more you mention optimizing your
recovery uh I feel the same trap as you
actually in terms of sleep and Recovery
I'm not sure if I've shared this story
on the podcast but when I first started
poker moved to Thailand with two friends
and because we live in a new country we
wanted to maximize our ability to play
lots of Poker but also have a good

[3:25:30]
lots of Poker but also have a good
lifestyle so went hm what can we cut out
sleep so we started reading up on sleep
and poly phasic sleep at the time was a
a thing going around some online forums
so we're okay poly physic sleeps four
and a half hours sleep with two
20-minute naps it called every man to
sleep okay

[3:25:47]
sleep okay
did that too yes I did a 12 month my
first 12 months of program on this sleep
schedule so we we basically we go to bed
at 10 p.m. no sorry 500 p.m. in the
afternoon and we'd wake up at 9:30 we'd
make breakfast together at 10 p.m. and

[3:26:01]
make breakfast together at 10 p.m. and
we'd Grind from 10 p.m. till 10:00 a.m.
in the morning with two 20-minute naps
throughout that 12 hour 12 hour span and
in all honesty like you get to the point
where you're so used to being sleep
deprived that when people ask me are you
tired I'll be like not really sure I

[3:26:15]
tired I'll be like not really sure I
feel fine but then once you come out of
it I did a full year of it and then went
back to normal sleep and I was like oh
my God I was literally so sleep deprived
the whole time that I couldn't even see
it that your Baseline of what's tired
gets completely altered and at this time
like I I hadn't read up on sleeping

[3:26:30]
like I I hadn't read up on sleeping
there wasn't as much material but I
started to think like this can't be like
a sustainable way of living I knew it
was extreme because the the kind of
forums that we found this on were were
kind of the biohacker world of kind of
extreme people but then I was like okay
as I got more into it I realized ah
feeling good is actually the best thing

[3:26:45]
feeling good is actually the best thing
and sleep I went from like the now I'm
probably eight and a half or 9 hour guy
compared to like the 5 hour sleep but I
think just understanding the variable of
performance requires good recovery and
if you cut recovery you're going to cut
performance maybe not directly maybe not
one for one in the same night but if
recovery is consistently suboptimal

[3:27:02]
recovery is consistently suboptimal
you're going to feel a performance hit
so yeah I just want to share my story on
sleep because I've I'm a sleep Advocate
now but I was a a wreck with sleep for a
long time and I think understanding what
you need to um to do recover so if I
could go back in time that would
definitely be a little knock on the
shoulder of myself go Adam get to bed

[3:27:16]
shoulder of myself go Adam get to bed
this is a a bad approach all right R for
yourself any more questions you've
got maybe one more I'm always curious
like what obviously everyone wants to be

[3:27:30]
like what obviously everyone wants to be
successful what is your definition of
sure well
uh I I I have changed my mind many times

[3:27:45]
uh I I I have changed my mind many times
with this
and
I I had this thought
experiment
um if you go back to
a class of yours you had like a

[3:28:00]
a class of yours you had like a
elementary school Meetup you know like
every 10 years or middle school
Meetup and U what what would you like
even like how would you go like if you

[3:28:15]
even like how would you go like if you
have a a nice car would you go with the
nice car or would you talk about your uh
what you do and what you achieved and
would you be proud of what you have
accomplished
and first my thought was like no I would

[3:28:32]
and first my thought was like no I would
hide it uh because I don't want people
to be uncomfortable when maybe they
didn't have that successful life or you
would say and then I changed my mind
that oh my God you have to be have to be

[3:28:47]
that oh my God you have to be have to be
proud you have to go there like hard and
you be have to be open and you don't
care about if you if you maybe hurt
people's feeling but you have to be
honest and uh proud and then I realized

[3:29:02]
honest and uh proud and then I realized
the third phase when I just I just
realized that success is such a broad
defin
def definition because you

[3:29:17]
def definition because you
instead of proud I got
more uh self-aware of how uh lucky I am
to be able to in my shoes and to do this
and U um have privileged to have this

[3:29:34]
and U um have privileged to have this
life and even to be able to learn poker
so even my parents we we weren't rich
and we were like very very basic family
but I I get everything I I wanted I I

[3:29:48]
but I I get everything I I wanted I I
had a really really good life and and um
I had
this
uh freedom to to just get into poker and
learn poker and and study and and uh

[3:30:03]
learn poker and and study and and uh
achieve some success in it and if you
think about it some maybe some other
dude is just working in a restaurant 15
years uh 15 years for 12 hours a day

[3:30:15]
years uh 15 years for 12 hours a day
that means he's
as much as grinding as me and maybe
maybe even more uh disciplined and maybe
even working way harder than I am but
maybe he didn't have the opportunity to

[3:30:31]
maybe he didn't have the opportunity to
to do what he loves to do and U as as I
always tell to my friends that you can
uh if the what's the most the the least
thing you can control is where you have

[3:30:47]
thing you can control is where you have
been born like you you could be born in
China you could be born in Africa you
could be born in the United States um
and how would you rate your if if there
is 8 billion people and you have the

[3:31:01]
is 8 billion people and you have the
chances where you where you can born get
born how would you rate where you were
born on a 0 to 100 scale and I think
like even Hungary with a small Village

[3:31:16]
like even Hungary with a small Village
like next to a city where I was born
it's like definitely top 90% like
running you from the Netherlands I think
Netherlands yeah they're definitely
running good there that's definitely

[3:31:30]
running good there that's definitely
running good and I think you you from
Adam from the UK Y correct yeah so I
mean those are like H how how can you
get better like maybe you can born into
a rich family in the United States or
Canada or I'm not not even sure but you

[3:31:47]
Canada or I'm not not even sure but you
can
certainly born in Africa having AIDS but
like you don't have any any control on
that so I was more about appreciating U

[3:32:04]
that so I was more about appreciating U
the the situation I'm in and and I'm I'm
really uh glad and happy that I I can be
in my shoes and I I can I can be

[3:32:16]
in my shoes and I I can I can be
uh I can do what I love to
do and uh yeah it just you just have to
find your
own uh thing you passionate about if you
can do it if you're fortunate enough and

[3:32:31]
can do it if you're fortunate enough and
then you just try to give your max I
think right well I wanna I want to thank
you laslo for sharing uh all your wisdom
on the on on this podcast and your
experience that you've got it over the

[3:32:45]

Adam any main takeaways from your
side yeah so we started the conversation
with his big lesson he learned in bankr
management where he almost went broke or

[3:33:30]
management where he almost went broke or
can did go broke and he learned the
lesson of how to build a bank roll and
how to not put yourself under too much
risk this left to led to many choices
around how he was going to approach his
career he came up with his winin formula
for poker which was study a lot and find
good games which I think so useful

[3:33:46]
good games which I think so useful
formula for every player and yeah I
think just learning the lesson of how do
I almost say get past that kind of
threshold of building the bank roll I
think a lot of players who are new in
their career or even two or three years
in are still struggling with that kind
of dilemma of how do I get myself above
water his solution was to IM more money

[3:34:02]
water his solution was to IM more money
and to move up stakes and to build a
better bank roll what I found really
interesting as we went through the
conversation today was how much A lot of
it came back to um just getting better
just studying just keep learning he's
had 15 years of Contin ously learning

[3:34:16]
had 15 years of Contin ously learning
more St he time blocks 90 minutes daily
to study you you magnet you compounded
over over 15 years that's a lot of
knowledge that's been compounded and
when we tried to uh kind of pinpoint a
certain skill or a certain tool it was
hard for him to do that because he's
he's learned so much in those kind of

[3:34:30]
he's learned so much in those kind of
time blocks over a long period of time
so I think that was very useful he
mentioned his critical thinking approach
in terms of he has quite a scientific
mind he likes using data obviously more
recently he's got big samples to use
data against how not to fall for
survivorship bias where we use a

[3:34:46]
survivorship bias where we use a
selection bias where the Mind gravitates
towards winners and losers this can show
up in terms of a losing hand of Poker or
can come in terms of who's winning
tournaments and your gravitate towards
we just being mindful of what data
points are you using to make your

[3:35:01]
points are you using to make your
decisions or conclusions and where are
your feelings uh dictating over data you
mentioned data overrides feelings I
wrote that one down as well and trying
to use a more critical way of thinking
about stuff and yeah like a lot of
skills that he mentioned I think we went
into them I went a bit a bit but in

[3:35:15]
into them I went a bit a bit but in
terms of studying hard playing a lot
game selecting well and I thing that
that we touch on the end as well falling
in love with studying this is the one
where my coaching as well working with
players and mindset a lot of times
players go through phases where they
just not enjoying the game as much and
very often it's because they're not

[3:35:30]
very often it's because they're not
working on the game they're not studying
as much they're trying to play a lot of
volume and it becomes a bit mundane I'm
sure any player doing the same kind of
grind for long enough especially 15
years it could get boring but if you're
learning new stuff and you're finding
ways to get creative to uh learn your
new strategies to uh fine tune stuff it

[3:35:46]
new strategies to uh fine tune stuff it
can be infinitely fun infinitely complex
it but infinitely fun so I think yeah a
lot of things about longevity there in
terms of his approach to always always
wantan to get better I think was yeah a
really really big a for me how about
yourself R what are some of the the main
things you wrote down yeah I can
strongly relate to strategical novelty

[3:36:03]
strongly relate to strategical novelty
for me at least it's always been a
necessity in order to not burn out and
to have a lot of longevity in my poke
career also he always went with the
Curve right he said he did adapt on the

[3:36:17]
Curve right he said he did adapt on the
later side with software when he finally
started using he said [ __ ] I should have
used this earlier but still he did go
with the software and he tried to study
I think I think I like that he said
right always when you looked in the past
he said po was so easy well we cannot go

[3:36:31]
he said po was so easy well we cannot go
back in the past but we could go into
the future so he would try to gain an
asch and out study their opponent so he
sort of puts himself in the future right
I think that was uh there was very good
knowledge he indeed also talked about
realizing your own skill level and Edge
level that that was something that was

[3:36:46]
level that that was something that was
often misapplied right that people
didn't really know their Edge in their
games and therefore people were playing
in games where they actually didn't have
a wiim rate um solution make more money
I think you're already touched on that
as well I always like these type of

[3:37:00]
as well I always like these type of
onliners he reached out actually to
quite a lot of coaches as well he
mentioned Paul Auto internet which has
been mentioned before by some other
players as well uh definitely back in
the days great coach um he also
mentioned goal's nose and mainly what
this gives you is a different

[3:37:16]
this gives you is a different
perspective right he also said that not
necessarily the best player might be the
best coach so it's important when you
find a coach to find someone you can
relate with usually most coaches you
know they have some sort of free content
um that you can at least consume to see

[3:37:30]
um that you can at least consume to see
if you kind of align with their ideas we
also talked about to not rely too much
on Willpower and discipline and I think
this really ties in nicely to having a
bigger goal I think I gave that example
for myself as well well when it was very
clear that I wanted to try to become the

[3:37:45]
clear that I wanted to try to become the
best poker player if something would
come across my path that I didn't that
didn't in line with that goal it was
just to know like I didn't have to think
oh should do I want to go out drinking
with my friends until four o'clock no
because it's not in line with my goal so
it's very easy and I feel like when you

[3:38:00]
it's very easy and I feel like when you
have less when you're less dedicated to
a longer term goal than for example get
loo right he had a couple of
materialistic things that he really
wanted the lambo that he has the nice
apartment things that he could look at
and be like yeah this is like the reward
of my poker career

[3:38:16]
of my poker career
and anytime like doubt would come up
should I go do this should I go do do
that it's quite clear what he should do
no I'm going to grind because I'm you
know I need I want to get this apartment
so I'm G to sit down and grind I think
he gave the Sneakers Bar example right
he thinks should I get the Sneakers Bar

[3:38:31]
he thinks should I get the Sneakers Bar
should I not get the Sneakers Bar I want
the Sneakers bar but it's not so healthy
he just put it a go out there as well
I'm not going to eat Sneaker Bar because
because it cost me $2,000 so he must
really like the snecker bar if you're
going to eat a snecker bar of $2,000 so
yeah that uh is all the points that I

[3:38:45]
yeah that uh is all the points that I
wrote down thanks again llo thank you
