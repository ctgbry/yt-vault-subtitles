same with for example we talked about
the jack five diamonds
it's very unfrequent but it raises a
very small percentage of the time
or like a hand like jack four for
example uh this is another example where
if you're just overly passive you're not
burying the turn and you're always
folding the river with certain hands
that not want to be bluffing
you're again playing a poor strategy
[Music]
do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo hi there
boys and girls and welcome back to
another video here at the poker ambition
channel and where today i'm going to
educate you guys a little bit
on the lifelong debate on blue line
versus red line winnings okay how does
it actually work do we actually need a
winning red line
in order to have bigger successes in
poker
now before you guys forget make sure to
give this video a thumbs up
uh leave some comments down below any
questions see
what you are struggling with is it the
red line or is it the blue line
without further ado let's get into a
couple of points that i want to start
off with
and afterwards we'll go into solver to
see how this kind of
plays out the first point i wanted to
start off with
in giving you guys some more general
understanding of how blue light versus
redline winnings actually win
is that some hands at certain spots
or playing versus specific opponent
tendencies
gain their ev by betting and raising
okay which is usually means
winnings in red line because when we do
betting or raising or we put our
opponent in a situation where he's more
likely to fold okay our one was a flop
goes up or when to shut and goes down
which usually leads to redline winnings
and in some spots by checking and
calling
so if we take the more passive line or
what was the flop will go down
or when the shoulder will go up
depending on if we afterwards call or
fault which is a point that i will get
to later
and that will usually lead to blue line
winnings
and if we obviously do more betting and
raising we will gain more redline if we
do less betting and raising we will gain
uh gain more blue line but it's not that
one is necessarily better than the other
it all depends on certain hands
or the spot you're in or the opponent
you're playing against okay
the second spot is if we take the
aggressive or passive action more often
or do it for the sake of being
aggressive or passive
and i think doing it for the sake of
being aggressive is more common than the
sake of being passive
if you're just doing it for the sake of
being passive it's probably your natural
tendency your natural bias leaning
towards specificity
we will win more redline or blue line
okay
kind of goes hand in hand with the point
above
if we try to win too much pots okay so
we're doing too much betting and raising
this will usually come then cost off our
blue line okay because we are
then moving hands that should win money
in blue line we're now moving them to
redline and if pushed too far also or
redline in general if you're trying to
win for too much spots
you're starting to invest in a lot of
pots that you're gonna end up losing for
example you're maybe a bit too sticky on
flop and turn
or try to pull out bluffs and then at
some point winning is just never folding
anymore and we've invested a lot of
money in the pot that we're often going
to lose for example if someone just
significantly overfolds the flop but we
do follow it up with aggression
later on a bit too often it will usually
lead to losses okay if we fight two pots
too little
okay our redline losses will have to be
compensated by our blue line winnings
now i'm not necessarily saying that this
is very bad okay obviously in some spots
we need
to try to win the pot uh usually leading
to redline winnings
but if you are a bit more on the passive
side
but let's say for example every time you
play there's a very big will
on the table who's going to give you
their money at some point
that means that you have very high blue
line winnings which means that you can
get away with losing more on redline
because your blue line winnings will
compensate that because of a certain
will on the table
for example this is a good example of
for example opponent tendencies
if we have a very big will who never
falls it's very hard
to and probably not advisable to try to
win redline versus them
the last point if we are not aggressive
with hands that should bet and raise
okay so we are moving redline hands that
should be betting and raising into a
more passive line
and don't get too showdown because we
fold these hands
okay that should call we will be losing
green line in the end guys it is about
the green line
so if we move a hand that should win its
head
its money by redlining so by being
betting and raising
if we move that to a more passive line
where in order we should maybe call the
river
but we ended up folding we ended up not
winning red line by being aggressive and
we also didn't win blue light by getting
to showdown
okay usually if both lions go down your
green line which is in the end is going
to be the most important we'll also go
down okay so these are a couple of like
introduction points that i think is very
important
uh before we get to the actual example
and in the end it is about that green
line guys
if your green line winnings go up happy
life
who cares what the other lines do for
that we need to ask ourselves where our
ev
value should come from giving our hand
the spot and our opponent
tendencies okay so i will try to take
these points in consideration when
looking at the example and without
further ado
we're going to take a look at it at a
solver where it's playing in position as
an
initial razor i'm going to kind of look
at it from both sides and kind of spot
hands that
are trying to gain their ev by redlining
and hands and try to gain their ev by
blue lining
so we are playing button versus big
blind flop comes queen eight
six the big man checks and it's up to
the in position
okay and the first thing that we can
notice is that there is
some mixed betting going on okay we
sometimes check
we sometimes bet small and we sometimes
bet very big
it's kind of the preference on a board
with these type of tendencies going
on and we can immediately add certain
hands in the darker red
one to too bad big which usually leads
to your opponent doing more
folding okay so usually already our red
line winnings go
up a very important point is that
certain hands
might prefer a red line strategy so
betting more often and maybe for a
bigger sizing on the earlier street
in order to set themselves up to gain
more blue line winnings on a later hand
okay this is actually a very big part of
playing good poker if we then look at
certain hands we can see for example i
had like ace king checking most often
this does not mean that batting is minus
v
for example if we ask the solver what is
the ev
of betting or checking being small
betting big we can see here on the right
bottom
that um the evs are actually quite close
and we shouldn't really take ev's in the
solver all too seriously because you
would see that with every hand that
basically
it doesn't really matter well it does in
practice
okay depending on the spot depending on
your poo that you're playing as and
specifically
on your opponent but we can clearly see
that
if we take this example from the solver
it clearly prefers a more passive
strategy with ace king offsuit more
often
leading to higher blue light winnings
okay
other hands prefer betting so let's say
for example we did that
um actually let's go for the check and
the turn is a deuce
and film bats and we can actually see
that we're now just folding a skin off
most of the time okay so we were
basically not really gaining
a blue line and we're also not really
gaining redline whereas if our opponent
would bat a bit smaller let's say three
quarters we're usually calling so if we
would be checking back ace king and then
folding to a bat that's smaller than
over bat
we're maybe making a mistake and not
winning any green line
okay this is an example whereas if for
example fit in over bats and we are
stubborn and decide to call with ace
king off
okay which means that we're going to win
the pot more often
okay then folding because obviously if
we thought we'd never win it but it's
not the most plus
ev line usually uh leading to
redline losses because often we can then
fold the river
if we also station the river so let's
say for example you're a person who
calls here the overhead we ace king and
also calls the river
we are losing massive on blue line okay
because it's clearly a spot
that the solver just prefers folding
because villain is just not bluffing
enough and
if you recall is just too bad and now
we're just playing red line for the sake
of return okay we're just stationing
obviously if you never fold uh you will
win a lot of redline and your blue line
will go down the drain this is not
really how poker works in the end it has
to be
in so let's say for example we do decide
to bet
and here for example for the opposition
we can already see a couple of
red line blue line tendencies as well he
mostly wants to check raise his king
queen
let's say for example you put that hand
into a check call means that you will
be a little bit more passive and
therefore play king queen in the ev
of blue lining which for example if you
play versus someone who's over
aggressive
then by all means let your opponent
bluff
off and never fold and just gain a lot
of blue line
for example on the other hand like five
six offsuit here you can see that it's
sometimes check raising
if we would always check raise that we
are significantly gaining
some redline okay and you can clearly
see that the solver does prefer
to do it some of the time so probably
either blue line or redlining
it's probably both fine if we get versus
earlier positions i know that for
example for epmp
i had like five six gets check race a
little bit more often
and this is them because the red line up
the red line option becomes more
attractive than the blue line option
because there's simply
less winnings or expected winnings in
the more passive line
so let's say for example our opponent
calls our small bat
and the turn is to do so hearts and we
can see that on the turn our strategy is
again
split we basically never want a bad
small
imposition usually this is not really a
thing there are some exceptions
but usually the bad sizing goes towards
three quarters and
over bat okay this is a very common
split if you're playing in position as
an initial razor
which means that certain hands will bet
a little bit smaller
and villain will fault less often so we
will get the showdown a little bit more
often
and certain hands that's very big and
villain is going to fold more often
okay now this doesn't necessarily mean
let's say for example
if you have pocket aces okay pockets is
clearly is a hand that prefers over
betting
if you are the type that says hey i'm
not going to overbat pocket aces because
if i over bet
finn is always full then i have like six
five i don't want that okay
this is an option but then you are
confusing
that you want to get called okay and
finding a sizing for which you get
called is not necessarily the most
positively sizing
because we can go very big with a hand
like pocket aces
and get called less often but still make
more money okay and there's still quite
a lot of blue line winnings
to be gained here okay because we're
getting for example called by any type
of queen
whereas for example certain other hands
prefer checking
again like the ace king for example
checks quite often
clearly a hand that we could also be
betting so if you start over betting
this yeah it's probably plus a fee
so you could actually do that and win a
lot of
redline but it's not the highest ev
option according to the solver
now if you play versus someone who's
overfolding the term massively you might
say
okay i'm gonna overbet a skin this is a
valid option
but we always still have to compare the
ev of checking with the ev of betting
let's say for example we have a hand
that is very low even checking which is
going to be maybe had like
jack five of diamonds okay if your
opponent
significantly overfalled in the turn we
might want to increase
our redline winnings by over betting
ahead like jack five of diamonds for
example
but keep our blue line when it's
attacked intact by checking for example
with a hand like ace king okay
and this is kind of uh exploitation
because if we then do this correctly we
can get both our lines up
which few am i playing in my opinion
play a very good exploitative strategy
uh it's definitely possible at least to
get a nice break even redline
and have good blue line winnings and i
also think this is the
this is a style that is hardest to play
against
from your opponent because if you're
just always blue lining or if you're
always focused on redlining and your
opponent is onto that
it kind of you don't really catch your
opponent by surprise because if i have
guys who are just over redline i don't
really have a decision anymore
as the defender because if the guy's
just over aggressive i'm just gonna yeah
okay
call down and and hope because he's just
out of line
where something someone is way too
passive if he just keeps on betting i'm
just gonna keep on folding okay
so i always try to find like that sweet
spot in the middle
so let's say for example we do decide to
check which certain hands prefer
let's say for example we have like
pocket jacks we can clearly see it's
preferring to bet
nice for example clearly prefers to bet
there's definitely a concept in there
so let's say we check and the river is
let's say the river is a four and we can
now see the out of position
strategy we can see that out of position
should do quite some betting
even with hands that are as weak as what
is his weakest hands
looks like a6 is sometimes betting uh
which again he best for a small sizing
but if we bet for a small sizing
feeling a full 28 of the time and when
he falls these winnings go to our
redline winnings okay so we can clearly
see we want to do
quite some betting now let's say we
never bat these small sizings and we
only bet overbet for example
that means that we're going to be
betting less and therefore checking more
and then your opponent can or check
behind or bet and you
then we usually call or fault but let's
say for example we
have an eight okay and we say okay we're
never gonna check fold and eight on the
river
we could check film bats and as you can
see
we don't really want to get in this line
that's why the hands are not really
showing
but any eight is probably calling okay
so
check calling the river against us blue
line whereas
clearly the spot in theory is preferred
to do a more of a redline approach it
bets
himself right we can see that most of
these hands are betting so if you would
always check these hands you
are missing on redline winnings right
same with for example um a bluff if you
let's say for example we have 910
we clearly want to be bluffing if you
don't bluff these hands you are
missing on redline winnings so let's say
for example
our opponent does bat and remember the
ace king that we talked about earlier
you can see that it now wants to call
or at least half of the time a head like
pocket jacks even wants to race actually
i will get to both these hands
a skin for example if we were checking
the turn and often folding the river
we're not winning blue line because we
fold it we're also not winning red line
because we didn't barrel the turn
and this is a clear example if you're
just checking always folding you're
just playing a poor strategy and you're
losing green line
okay same with jax jacks for example
especially versus smaller sizing always
wants to race basically a lot of your
maybe ace 8 yeah you can see ace 8 king
8 this is kind of the the bottom
of hands that you want to be raising
these type of holdings they
they don't feel like that a one third
bat and a one third bat is getting
enough value so they now want to race
if you don't make these races okay you
might be better off
barreling the turn more often okay else
you're just clearly losing
value same with for example we talked
about the jack five diamonds
it's very unfrequent but it raises a
very small percentage of the time
or like a hand like jack iv for example
uh this is another example where
if you're just overly passive you're not
barring the turn and you're always
folding the river with certain hands
that now want to be bluffing
you're again playing a poor strategy
okay
then it's no longer has something to do
with being with something having a pre
a preference right and also you can see
that in order to
increase the efficiency or increase more
redline winnings
uh it actually starts over betting ahead
like ten nine
so let's say for example you're always
uh betting small width
above like ten nine uh maybe this is
also
way bad if you're lacking some redline
to add some more over betting in general
to your game
definitely also boosting redline now
let's say for example
um the the actually pocket sevens was i
can actually
now see the bottom together with a6
uh which is important for the next card
actually i want to take a look at so
let's say for example the river is an
ace
also flush complete and actually we see
that uh pocket sevens obviously a6 is
now more likely to bet
because the handstand but seven is never
betting anymore also an eight
is not betting anymore and this is a
spot where maybe if you're winning too
much redline
um that you're not adjusting to the spot
because here clearly we don't really
want to be betting small anymore with a
hand like 10 8
obviously we can but that would just be
betting for the sake of betting and no
longer because it's the
it's the most plus we play so this is a
good example of
uh same hand but a spot that now varies
uh also we don't
uh we actually see also that the over
betting disappeared so if we either have
like 109 you see it no longer wants to
overlap
there are some reasons for that as well
just an overall strategy shift
uh obviously there's still redline and
green line uh redline blue line when is
going on but
the spot just plays a little bit
differently okay
then if villain checks we can see that
we now want to be bluffing ahead like
jack five of diamonds
which you know this makes quite a lot of
sense on the term we had quite a shitty
hand
uh so we checked back and then the
referee checks again and now we want to
be
bluffing again if you would miss these
type of bluffs
you are losing redline winnings okay
you are clearly these are then
definitely spots like patrick bad spots
or maybe like some more turn barreling
especially in spots where people are
over
folding these are spots where you can
boost your redline winning so if you
have a redline winning leak
okay then you're maybe missing out on
these type of barrels okay and we get a
lot of
nice hands to fold i think these type of
hands usually automatically folding
a standard ace jack the king jack are
reasonable hands a lot of 6x are folding
so i think this is a fine
a fine play um also in terms of if you
are a little bit struggling with your
redline
i mean he should for example call pocket
trees if you think pocket trees are not
calling in your population
then obviously betting more often
without like jack five of diamonds will
gain you more money and this is actually
something that
the the mda movement the the mass
data analysis movement always talks
about that a lot of spots in the
population
it is more common that they do
overfolding than underfolding
therefore having more of a preference
towards redline strategies is a good
idea
however if you are the type of
overwinning on redline
you are clearly ignoring the fact that
certain hands should
also have a lot of ev in trying to for
example bluff catch or trying to get to
showdown
maybe setting up a little bit of uh
reverse imply that situation for your
opponent and you're kind of ignoring
that so that would be a leak as well
so i hope you guys start to understand i
think a little bit different now about
blue line and redline winnings after
that example
and kind of start to understand that
some hands want to get their
uh their value from blue lining and
other hands want to get their value from
redlining
now obviously we could go on about this
topic and there's
a lot of things in play and
it gets a little bit more complicated
and we can add way more nuances but i
would like to keep this video under 10
hours
and i wanted to end up with a couple of
points to sum this video up
that is this is for the redliners you
cannot go to the ferrari dealer and say
that you want to pay in redline winnings
okay it is not about the redline
winnings okay you're maybe confusing
of winning the pop most often compared
to making the highest ev decision okay
this is a common league for people who
are
over fighting for pots however if you're
losing more than necessarily this is
definitely a leak
okay people then say is it the leak to
have redline losses i would say
depends on how much let's say for
example for every buy-in you win
you lose around half a buy in
so if you win one buy in a showdown and
you lose around half a buy-in
in red line i think that is kind of the
yeah it shouldn't drop lower than that
preferably it would go a little bit
towards
towards a little bit more towards break
even but if it falls below that ratio i
would say you're definitely leaking
and you should definitely look to play a
couple hands more aggressive
in certain spots uh for example we saw
that the five six hand
on the queen 86 from the outer position
was already check raising
you're probably missing out on t stack
of place okay
it is not that one style is better than
the other
it depends on your hand the spot and
your opponent okay
if you have your opponent who's over
folding then by all means be more
aggressive
okay if you have an opponent who's
underfolding then by all means value bet
the guy
thinly and stop bluffing him
point number three we naturally lean
towards
one style know yours to see if you
should be on the lookout for spots to be
more aggressive or
passive so in general
your natural bias or your natural
tendency can lean towards being more
aggressive or passive
mine in general for example pre-flop i
tend to be a little bit more on the
passive side by nature so
if i don't focus on that i will do way
too much calling and wait for less tree
betting or for betting or fight betting
whatever you want usually leading to
a bit more slacking uh of my redline
okay so this is an example of a natural
tendency
other guys may be a bit too aggressive
on on certain streets
and you know they're straight up
barreling the the jack five
diamonds the ace kings basically any
hand that
uh that they can they just say listen my
opponent is overfalling i'm barreling
range
this is not necessarily how poker works
okay guys
you're kind of ignoring uh evs in other
lines as well
now if you guys need any help
understanding when to redline or when to
blue line this is all
uh a concept of where should my ev come
from
how does certain strategies generate a
fee we have a program the mechanics of
poker in which we can
help you get more clarity now if you're
having trouble with
your redline blue line ratio in a
specific spot
we also start to offer master classes of
which the first one is now available
which is how to play three web pods out
of position definitely more of a redline
spot than others giving the nature of
the spot
so maybe if you're lacking redline that
could be a masterclass for
you now if you are not interested in any
of the products
perfectly fine as well i'm sure or i
hope you would have gotten some value
out of this video make sure if you
haven't done so to subscribe to our
channel so you'll be first to know when
we release new content
and i wish you guys a lot of luck
improving your red line and blue line
winnings let us know in the comments
down below
what you were kind of struggling with
and what are kind of the main takeaways
from this video for you
and i wish you guys a lot of luck at
