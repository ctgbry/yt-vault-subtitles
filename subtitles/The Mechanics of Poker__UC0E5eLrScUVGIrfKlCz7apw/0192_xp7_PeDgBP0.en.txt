actually you just have to realize that
uh some parts of Rubik's Cube um they

[18:32]
uh some parts of Rubik's Cube um they

[18:32]
uh some parts of Rubik's Cube um they
can't move so they are just in their

[18:35]
can't move so they are just in their

[18:35]
can't move so they are just in their
positions forever it's like this middle

[18:39]

[18:39]
positions forever it's like this middle
um this center

[18:41]
um this center

[18:41]
um this center
pieces um so white would be always

[18:45]
pieces um so white would be always

[18:45]
pieces um so white would be always
against yellow and like green would be

[18:49]
against yellow and like green would be

[18:49]
against yellow and like green would be
always against Blue so you have to and

[18:52]
always against Blue so you have to and

[18:52]
always against Blue so you have to and
uh you you can do everything like every

[18:55]
uh you you can do everything like every

[18:55]
uh you you can do everything like every
possible move you can do like 200 moves

[18:58]
possible move you can do like 200 moves

[18:58]

and uh nothing would change white and

[19:02]
and uh nothing would change white and

[19:02]
and uh nothing would change white and
opposite is yellow yeah yeah so knowing

[19:07]
opposite is yellow yeah yeah so knowing

around this piece so this Center is blue

[19:28]
around this piece so this Center is blue

[19:28]
around this piece so this Center is blue
so uh it would be blue and I have just

[19:32]
so uh it would be blue and I have just

[19:32]
so uh it would be blue and I have just
to build around the center pieces and

[19:34]
to build around the center pieces and

to build around the center pieces and
this one would be orange and green and

[19:38]
this one would be orange and green and
