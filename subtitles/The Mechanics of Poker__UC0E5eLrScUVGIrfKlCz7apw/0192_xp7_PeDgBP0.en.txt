Russian high stakes cash game player
Nikolai did
one F doov did I say that correctly I
could have been butchering that F doimo

[02:45]
could have been butchering that F doimo
I'm gonna keep it at that Nikolai broke
through to the high six scene a couple
of years ago after playing mid six for
about six year he has experienced
coaching and playing at all levels and
attributes his success to hard work
having a deep love interest and curios
osity for the game he has agreed to come

[03:02]
osity for the game he has agreed to come

to you too any New Year's resolutions

[03:15]
to you too any New Year's resolutions
you set for 2024 and while you're at it
do you have maybe any tips for players
that have set New Year's resolutions how
to actually reach
them well yeah Happy New Year to you and
to our audience we are back with more
podcasts and hopefully we're in a good
Rhythm for the the year ahead so yeah

[03:31]
Rhythm for the the year ahead so yeah
myself I've spent a lot of time the last
week I saw reflecting on the year that's
just gone by so I'll just go through the
process I like to uh to go through is
basically first of all distilling
success what went well in the previous
year just looking back things I'm happy
with things I'm proud of things I showed

[03:45]
with things I'm proud of things I showed
up with consistently and goals I
progress towards then I go into my
failures things I didn't show up so well
things I didn't quite progress with
goals I didn't achieve that I wanted to
at the start of the year and what can I
learn from those things so I try to do a
little bit of reflecting on the kind of
good and the bad side of it and then

[04:01]
good and the bad side of it and then
finally I go into what can I improve for
the year ahead so I think for everyone
listening the new year is a good chance
to go what do I want to achieve for the
year ahead so for me I focus on more
identity based stuff who do I want to be
this year what version of myself do I
want to step into for the year ahead

[04:16]
want to step into for the year ahead
what challenges do I want to take on and
where do I want to go so one specific
challenge for me this year is I'm going
to do a powerlifting event in a few
months that was something I've wanted to
do last year and didn't do so I'm my
reflection all right right I'm going to
put that to bed and I'm going to make
sure I take action but for me my goals

[04:31]
sure I take action but for me my goals
are generally around growing as a person
and taking on challenges that are align
with that and yeah hopefully our
audience are ready to grow and this
podcast today will be your first growth

without further Ado let's get into
today's episode with
Nikolai all right Nikolai thank you for
coming on the podcast man thank you for
having me well Nikolai you have been

[05:46]
having me well Nikolai you have been
playing poker professionally for I
believe it is nine years now and of
those nine years I think for like the
last three years you've been competing
at the highest online games and the
first question that comes to mind is
what motivates you to compete in these

[06:01]
what motivates you to compete in these
high stakes cash
games I would say it's not about uh what
motivate me but what dism motivate me
because uh when I reach first reach like
1K 2K NL um I was always told that uh

[06:20]
1K 2K NL um I was always told that uh
high stakes game are dead like there's
no high stakes game anymore no reason to
go for five 10K on stars because there's
no uh enough uh good game so I was I

[06:34]
no uh enough uh good game so I was I
always thought that I shouldn't really
go there I should just basically earn
some money and uh try to um do something
with that money so I go play offline

[06:47]
with that money so I go play offline
poker I staked lots of people in uh mtts
in cash games I did some like business
uh tries uh
offline uh I did lots of investing in

[07:01]
offline uh I did lots of investing in
crypto as like everybody in poker world
I think
so it was uh not about motivation but
about this motivation I would say and U
things changed when uh GG came because

[07:19]
things changed when uh GG came because
uh GG came with lots of um lots of high
stakes games and actually um I thought
played on GG like five or even six years

[07:31]
played on GG like five or even six years
ago it's been it's been a lot already so
uh when I first try it I thought that uh
yeah it looks pretty uh pretty cool for

[07:45]
yeah it looks pretty uh pretty cool for
um recreational so maybe uh this poker
room has a chance and uh then I left I I
earned some money there actually I did
really great at like U 400 and 1 KL back

[08:01]
really great at like U 400 and 1 KL back
then there were no
500 and um so like in two years uh I
heard about GG like
everywhere uh GG became really really
big and I saw that there are lots of

[08:18]
big and I saw that there are lots of
high stakes games and uh I kind of just
uh changed my priorities I would say I
thought that I should go for high stakes
and uh that it's probably better option

[08:32]
and uh that it's probably better option
for me uh to try to go to the top in
cash games poker instead of trying to do
something with the money I um earned at
the moment so I just switched basically

[08:46]
the moment so I just switched basically
I would say and GG is the main reason
you saw so in the beginning before GG
you saw more need in diversifying your
portfolio right you mentioned investing
in businesses crypto because you kind of
felt like 2K was sort of a cap when you

[09:02]
felt like 2K was sort of a cap when you
then decided like okay high stakes is
now alive again and I guess you then put
it your sole focus on reaching high
stakes how did that then change for you
how you approached uh the game but also

[09:17]
how you approached uh the game but also
I guess your professionalism around the
game yeah absolutely uh you right that
was like that
um at first I took lots of sessions with

[09:31]
um at first I took lots of sessions with
uh really uh tough guys from Russian
community so I I spent some money on
coaching uh then um I stopped trying to
do lots of other stuff so I can focus on

[09:47]
do lots of other stuff so I can focus on
my main game so I uh finished with my
investing time and I basically just um
uh decided that I would spend SP all of
my time only in that

[10:01]
my time only in that
direction and that was the main reason
um I just decided and I put some hours
in uh lots of hours actually so I never
spent that many hours on um theory in

[10:16]
spent that many hours on um theory in
poker because uh yeah I for sure I
worked but it wasn't that hot ever but
this um two or maybe three years uh I
spent lots of time um studying poker

[10:32]
spent lots of time um studying poker
playing poker just observing poker uh
play uh watching like lots of YouTube
poker and like poker poker I would say
that I'm leaving poker these three years
and I would also say that uh the best

[10:49]
and I would also say that uh the best
the best um decision to achieve
something in uh this game is just to uh
decide that you going to leave this game
game if you know what I mean yeah if

[11:01]
game if you know what I mean yeah if
you're going to like you live the game
you breathe poker 247 before that when
you had to divide your time and also
your attention I noticed this for myself
personally as well like your brain then
has to shift between tasks and between

[11:16]
has to shift between tasks and between
for example you were talking about
investing you were talking about crypto
so your brain every time has to switch
games so to speak right whereas if if
poker is all you think about then your
brain just we're we're poker players
we're we're doing so it's easier to

[11:30]
we're we're doing so it's easier to
really go deep into into strategy before
that I wanted to before we continue
around this topic I wanted to ask you if
you've ever been competitive in other
sports or games prior to

[11:45]
Poker yeah well actually um usually the
case is um previously somebody played
like Warcraft or daughter but uh for me
it's
different um I didn't do any sports but
but uh well actually maybe that's a

[12:02]
but uh well actually maybe that's a
sport but so when I was young uh like at
my 12 it's not young it's actually like
teen age uh I did a lot of speed

[12:15]
teen age uh I did a lot of speed
cubing well actually it's um so uh it's
solving Rubik's Cube and not only
Rubik's Cube but other uh cubes in time
uh as fast as you possibly can and there
are lots of competitions in the world on

[12:34]
are lots of competitions in the world on
that so I did attend a lot of
competitions in Russia in Ukraine and I
in Belarus I actually went to Thailand

[12:46]
in Belarus I actually went to Thailand
uh first in my
life uh at
2000 I don't know 10 or something like
that uh to attend in World Championship
in with Cuban so yeah that was pretty

[13:01]
in with Cuban so yeah that was pretty
big part of my life and
I uh I enjoy that it was really good
times and uh I'm very grateful for that
experience because it taught me a lot um

[13:16]
experience because it taught me a lot um
yeah I I would say that the main thing
that I
uh earned from it is just the thought
that everything is achievable and not
like uh just uh this beautiful phrase

[13:34]
like uh just uh this beautiful phrase
but uh like a feeling you
know because I remember when I first
discovered speed cubin for myself I saw
video on YouTube where some Japan

[13:47]
video on YouTube where some Japan
Japanese guy uh solved the Rubik Cube
really fast B and uh it was like 8
seconds or so and I was very amazed and
I felt like he is just from some other

[14:01]
I felt like he is just from some other
planet it's uh it's impossible but then
I just uh I got some interested in that
and I start studying it start practicing
practicing practicing and in uh I don't

[14:16]
practicing practicing and in uh I don't
know three four years later I I didn't
even notice how
it how um it went but I realized that
I'm here right now and easy for me to
solve Rubik's Cube just like that guy

[14:31]
solve Rubik's Cube just like that guy
did and uh yeah thank I I I'm very
grateful for that experience because um
after that um I always feel really
confident that if you put some hours in

[14:49]
confident that if you put some hours in
uh you can achieve a lot in like
everything yeah when you say like few
that it's a achievable do you mean that

[15:00]
that it's a achievable do you mean that
like there's a certain confidence
because for example I can see someone do
something so I know that it's physically
or you know it's possible but then I
still need to have the confidence that I
would be able to do it is that then what
you mean with the feeling that it's
possible that you have confidence in

[15:16]
possible that you have confidence in
yourself that oh well if he can do it I
can do it for sure yeah for sure in
myself I just uh uh realize that uh it's
only about practicing and putting uh not
only practicing but practicing and uh

[15:33]
only practicing but practicing and uh
thinking about like leaving yeah I would
say leaving just like I said I left
poker for fre uh last years and I Le
speed cubing back back then for three or
four years and I managed to uh win

[15:48]
four years and I managed to uh win
Russian Championship once actually so I
can say that uh in some period I was the
best Russian Speed Cube solver
uh in the whole country and I um had

[16:03]
uh in the whole country and I um had
lots of national records in some uh like
different
disciplines um so there are lots of like
2 by two 3x4 4 by4 5 by five and so on

[16:16]
2 by two 3x4 4 by4 5 by five and so on
and I had some national records
and yeah so it was
achievable uh just because I uh lived
that I was really uh enjoying that I was

[16:31]
that I was really uh enjoying that I was
practicing really a lot and uh I was
watching uh stuff regarding that I was
um um talking to other guys from forums
and stuff like that so uh actually it's

[16:48]
and stuff like that so uh actually it's
really kind of the same now but only
that I'm almost 30 years old and now
it's poker but not speed cubing but it's
pretty much the same I mean I'm sure I'm
sure a lot of the listeners and me

[17:01]
sure a lot of the listeners and me
included we I I have had a Rubik Cube in
my hand and I've spinned around a bit
and like wait but if I spin the red to
this side then now the other side is
screwed up so I don't know if you maybe
have like a Rubik Cube nearby maybe you
could give us a little a little started

[17:15]
could give us a little a little started
tutorial how to fix a Rubik Cube and
maybe a little little demonstration at
the end as
well um yeah so I actually every every
time I have one Rubik's Cube at my uh
table so uh when like there are no games

[17:34]
table so uh when like there are no games
I can just turn it bit like
that just to practice my fingers it's
actually uh yeah you you would be

[17:46]
actually uh yeah you you would be
probably imagine you wouldn't really
imagine how fast it can get because
right now like the best guys in the
world do like nine turns per second on
the Rubik's Cube that's like the hell

[18:01]
the Rubik's Cube that's like the hell
that's like the best results I mean it's
crazy fast I'm not even close at being
that fast but well if you're talking
about how to solve it uh I would say
that uh it's not like I'm genius and did

[18:16]
that uh it's not like I'm genius and did
that I was just interested and I watched
some YouTube tutorial and uh that helped
me to do it it's not uh that hard
actually you just have to realize that
uh some parts of Rubik's Cube um they

[18:32]
uh some parts of Rubik's Cube um they
can't move so they are just in their
positions forever it's like this middle
um this center
pieces um so white would be always

[18:45]
pieces um so white would be always
against yellow and like green would be
always against Blue so you have to and
uh you you can do everything like every
possible move you can do like 200 moves
and uh nothing would change white and

[19:02]
and uh nothing would change white and
opposite is yellow yeah yeah so knowing
knowing that so that that's the star
point that you know okay so White's
always here yellow's always there so in
your head you're already thinking okay
well white yellow it's always going to

[19:15]
well white yellow it's always going to
be the opposite of each
other yeah so and if you know that you
just uh basically start building um uh
around this piece so this Center is blue
so uh it would be blue and I have just

[19:32]
so uh it would be blue and I have just
to build around the center pieces and
this one would be orange and green and
red and so on yes but then I get all the
blues to the blue side and then I feel
relatively happy with myself but then I

[19:45]
relatively happy with myself but then I
turn that turn the C around and then
it's all of a mess but on the other
side yeah and then you just open the
YouTube tutorial and you you can manage
to do it it's not that hard
just about practicing as well and then

[20:01]
just about practicing as well and then
from
there there's no there's no more
involvement in strategy like get a
strategy same than whoever is faster
with their fingers that then becomes
sort of the edge no no no it's not like
that it's actually crazy hot when you go

[20:16]
that it's actually crazy hot when you go
to speed cubing so it's I would say it's
really easy to uh sorry to be able to
Sol Rubik's Cube so I would say like
probably every person who spent like one

[20:30]
probably every person who spent like one
maybe two hours in a really good YouTube
tutorial maybe I'm wrong because it's
easy for me right now maybe it's not
like two hours maybe 10 but I would say
like everybody would do it and me
personally back in the uh University

[20:46]
personally back in the uh University
when I was there and everybody was like
amazed and uh asked if I can uh T them
uh so I taught like 20 maybe 30 people
around me everybody was possible to do

[21:02]
around me everybody was possible to do
it at the end everybody absolutely no uh
there are no um I I don't remember this
word sorry so no um everybody would do
it at the end so you should have kept it

[21:16]
it at the end so you should have kept it
to yourself man I can imagine you know
you're at University you go to these
University parties you bring your Rubik
Cube you say hey girls look what I can
do with my rub Cube you
know yeah it doesn't work like that
actually no it's not okay it's it's it's

[21:30]
actually no it's not okay it's it's it's
not a cheick magnet okay yeah yeah yeah
okay so and uh if you go to the um speed
cubing uh when it's really hard because
at first you have to learn a lot of

[21:45]
at first you have to learn a lot of
stuff lots of lots of
algorithms and um you you should do lots
of practic and basically um to get
really fast you have to be able to look
ahead look look ahead is like um I don't

[22:01]
ahead look look ahead is like um I don't
know it's
like a world which um would understand
only speed cuber but it's a very very
big part of speed cubing uh which which
is like you have to be able to plan

[22:17]
is like you have to be able to plan
ahead lots of moves already so I'm doing
something but I'm not thinking about
that already because I should have
thought about that previously now I'm
thinking about what I would do next and

[22:30]
thinking about what I would do next and
the best cubers they are just uh
doing uh doing the solve basically with
no poses but uh their brain would work
like it's it's really hard
and to to be able to solve Rubik's Cube

[22:47]
and to to be able to solve Rubik's Cube
in like 20 seconds you have to just um
maybe 30 seconds okay you have to just U
learn some basic finger finger tricks so
you you have to just realize that it's

[23:00]
you you have to just realize that it's
not about moving like that like would
usual person do but it's moving fingers
like
that and then it be become fast but it's
easy part so uh and you can easily go to

[23:15]
easy part so uh and you can easily go to
30 seconds if you just learn some
algorithms and do these finger tricks
practice them but after that it it comes
really really hard so to go from solving
r in 20 seconds to go to solving it like

[23:32]
r in 20 seconds to go to solving it like
in 10 or 12 seconds it can be years yeah
oh wow so that that that's top sport
right there right in top sport the the
edges are small we're talking about
millisecond so it's kind of the same as
speed cubing you already mentioned that

[23:45]
speed cubing you already mentioned that
like what you what speed cubing has
taught you is that basically everything
is possible if you put the time and
effort into it you you mentioned
something interesting that uh in speed
cubing or in solving a rubis scoup is
very important to look ahead to plan

[24:01]
very important to look ahead to plan
moves ahead this actually sounds very
similar to Poker or for example to chess
as well right because your actions on or
if we talk in poker terms your actions
on the current Street will have
consequences to how the equities will

[24:15]
consequences to how the equities will
line up on future street so you have to
take in consideration runouts before you
make your move on the flop for example
because you're going to steer the hand
in a certain direction right you're
going to you're going to try to you kind
basically going to isolate yourself
against a part of Vain's range and you
have to think look ahead how that's

[24:31]
have to think look ahead how that's
going to turn out a later Street and if
that's going to be beneficial for you is
is that one of the similarities that you
found strategically I guess yeah yeah
sure there are lots of similarities
actually and even the environment
um behind it is kind of similar because

[24:48]
um behind it is kind of similar because
um these forums this YouTube uh videos
this um the community about it uh all
these competition itions because um I
have lots of flashbacks when I was young

[25:02]
have lots of flashbacks when I was young
and I uh go for some
competition I would um meet lots of
people and we would be like friends even
if we don't know each other because we

[25:15]
if we don't know each other because we
uh we are really enjoying the same thing
and in poker it's pretty much the same
so if I go to the poker uh poker
tournament right now I would U uh meet
lots of people who are just loving the

[25:31]
lots of people who are just loving the
game of poker and uh we would already
have lots of thing to discuss yeah so
lots of similarities actually and if
you're talking about strategy it's also
kind of similar because you have to plan

[25:45]
kind of similar because you have to plan
ahead and you have to take some
responsibilities for for your actions in
CU in Rubik's Cube actually there are
lots of difficulties uh as well because
uh like for example your Cube can just

[26:00]
uh like for example your Cube can just
pop so there is uh you can you
can uh regular your tension on the
[Music]
sides do you understand what I mean like

[26:16]
sides do you understand what I mean like
you yeah you you you can regulate one
side to one color yeah yeah so uh in
every probably I will be able to no I'm
not able to open it right now okay so uh
there is um you can use screwdriver to

[26:32]
there is um you can use screwdriver to
um to regulate each side and we are like
uh at for formula one so this is my bed
you know so it's my responsibility to um

[26:48]
you know so it's my responsibility to um
prepare my cube right you know do lots
of stuff like tension like using some
lube to Dube it because so it would turn
that fast you have to Dube your Cube

[27:02]
that fast you have to Dube your Cube
like Cube Cube maintenance is very
important as well because you bring your
own Rubik's Cube or when you go to a
competition you get handed yeah for sure
only only your own Rubik's Cube nobody
would
ever to the competition yeah no don't

[27:15]
ever to the competition yeah no don't
touch my Rubik's Cube all right yeah
yeah yeah absolutely there's such a
thing actually uh and um like in really
prestigious competition in uh World
Championship somebody would be really
mad if he lost his Cube you know because

[27:33]
mad if he lost his Cube you know because
it's it's lots of work already done um
and cubes are really different and you
uh
can adjust yeah adjust that's world you

[27:45]
can adjust yeah adjust that's world you
can adjust that the uh cubes different
as well so it's a lot of work uh behind
that as well so it's uh
well lots of similarities in poker
and it it feels a bit like for example

[28:02]
and it it feels a bit like for example
in skateboarding or something right you
have the actual Act of skateboarding but
then you also have like the maintainance
of your board making sure the wheels
roll quite smoothly it seems quite
similar in the in the Rubik Cube
scene yeah yeah could you maybe give us

[28:16]
scene yeah yeah could you maybe give us
a little a little a little demonstration
of uh of you solving solving a Rubes
cube in uh in speed in speed record
time I should um put it from the camera
yes yes so you see that uh yeah probably

[28:31]
yes yes so you see that uh yeah probably
this this is fine so uh at first when
you at the competition uh you don't get
your rubby Cube like that you uh get it
covered so I wouldn't see that and I can
prepare and say like yeah I'm ready and

[28:47]
prepare and say like yeah I'm ready and
then uh the judge would open my Cube and
I have eight seconds to prepare the Sol
what I mean by that is uh when you are
speed cuber you already have to plan

[29:02]
speed cuber you already have to plan
lots of moves in 8
seconds and this 8 seconds is actually
also a thing which uh differs lots of
speed cubers because the best would um

[29:15]
speed cubers because the best would um
plan ahead like 30 moves already maybe
you know 30 moves of your Rubik's Cube
in eight seconds you just understand
that if I move like that this would be
this piece would go down and like that
and so on and you plan a lot a lot

[29:32]
and so on and you plan a lot a lot
really a lot I'm not that good so I can
plan only I don't know maybe 10 moves
but it's still something so this eight
seconds and then I

[29:52]
go it's actually wasn't that fast I
think it I mean was like 10 seconds yeah
I think like around 10 seconds that's I

[30:01]
I think like around 10 seconds that's I
think around 11 and I would say that I
have I had lots of practice so I feel
that time uh pretty correct usually and
it it was pretty bad Sol for Me Maybe
I'm nervous I usually do 10 seconds uh

[30:17]
I'm nervous I usually do 10 seconds uh
yeah but still that's I me I mean look
done for that this this this will get
uploaded to a poker channel so everyone
will think you're a genius so don't
worry like most you upload this to a

[30:30]
worry like most you upload this to a
cubing you know they're all going to be
like oh you know your Cub's Loop isn't
well looped and you know you use the
wrong finger movement and I don't know
what kind of but here on this channel
man everyone will think you're a genius
so congratulations uh how did you then
transition into from Rubik cubing in to

[30:47]
transition into from Rubik cubing in to
Poker I've heard you also use the word
love for the game so why and when did
you fall in love with the game of
poker yeah
um I switched because of money so uh I'm

[31:01]
um I switched because of money so uh I'm
from pretty big family and we didn't
have lots of money and it was fun to do
that speed cubin but there is no money
in it uh when even when I became Uh
Russian
Champion um I was given like $1,000 I

[31:18]
Champion um I was given like $1,000 I
think something like that
so it's not much well it's it's kind of
cool when you are really young but uh
it's nothing uh when you want to be a

[31:31]
it's nothing uh when you want to be a
grown up so uh I just had to quit it and
uh I started to looking for some
opportunities and uh uh I'm back I'm I

[31:45]
opportunities and uh uh I'm back I'm I
was born in a pretty small town named
ksk and um I managed to get to the
Moscow University and lived in the
dormitory and um with we had lots of
parting for sure there and once uh

[32:01]
parting for sure there and once uh
friend of mine he invited me to the
party and said like we would play poker
and drink and I said that uh I never
played poker and he said that he would

[32:15]
played poker and he said that he would
teach me and it's
easy uh I actually managed to scoop my
first ever see them go and that's the
moment when I fell in love uh with poker
for forever I would say I I'm really uh

[32:31]
for forever I would say I I'm really uh
there are lots of poker players uh who
uh say when we discuss poker like yeah
poker is U boring uh I hate poker I just
have to put hours in so I would get

[32:46]
have to put hours in so I would get
money back from it and like that but I'm
not that type of guy I'm just loving the
game I I [ __ ] love the game I would
say even like that and uh it wasn't it
probably it was because uh I uh scooped

[33:02]
probably it was because uh I uh scooped
my ever tournament probably but I think
uh it's more
like uh it suits me really good because
I'm like a gambler in my heart but I'm

[33:16]
I'm like a gambler in my heart but I'm
like um not a crazy Gambler so I cannot
really imagine that I would sit at uh
like 40kl having uh 40,000 it's it's
impossible for me but uh in every game I

[33:31]
impossible for me but uh in every game I
play I try my best to win and uh I get a
lot of pleasure to trying to
win uh and um I enjoy the process of
playing each game and like back in the

[33:47]
playing each game and like back in the
dormatory we we had lots of different uh
like U games um I I don't remember what
how do you call it like stand game I
think I enjoyed playing all of them I

[34:02]
think I enjoyed playing all of them I
enjoyed studying them I enjoyed trying
to get the edge in that in that
so yeah I'm a gamber in in
that and uh back then in um when when I

[34:17]
that and uh back then in um when when I
was a kid I uh did a lot of boxing so I
did like five years of boxing and uh it
also taught me some things like you have

[34:30]
also taught me some things like you have
it's not about uh how hard you hit it's
about how hard you can get hit stuff
like that which uh uh which is really
cool words but I uh I felt it a lot of

[34:45]
cool words but I uh I felt it a lot of
times when I did boxing because uh yeah
I I uh got beaten a lot of my times a
lot of times in my life when I was a kid
and um it's also I think whole

[35:02]
and um it's also I think whole
background um helped me a lot so I can
feel in poker like uh it's my my
environment already you know what I mean
yeah you you were sort of you were sort
of prepared for this yeah yeah and whole

[35:16]
of prepared for this yeah yeah and whole
my life uh like prepared me for for that
so I wouldn't say that um it's it's that
uh I'm so cool that I love the game and
like that lucky guy that has a job uh

[35:31]
like that lucky guy that has a job uh
which is not job which is just like
living a dream I would say that I I got
lucky that it's the case for me but but
it's the case so I I love poer but it's
not about me it's about the environment

[35:47]
not about me it's about the environment
I grew up in I think it's like that so
so when did you then decide to to you
were studying studing in the Moscow
University when did you transition into
playing poker

[36:01]
playing poker
professionally or was it a decision or
did it just sort of happen yeah it was
the decision decision for sure so um at
the first year in my University already
I um realized that I should take this

[36:16]
I um realized that I should take this
opportunity living in Moscow not to
finish my University grade but to um
manage to find good work uh some good
relationships and and stuff like that so

[36:30]
relationships and and stuff like that so
uh I was really really bad at the
University if you talk about
studying um I actually was really close
to get expelled like two or three times

[36:46]
to get expelled like two or three times
but I did try a lot of stuff um to earn
money so and uh when I discovered poker
from myself I already um did uh

[37:01]
from myself I already um did uh
some I would say like
um so I I tried some other stuff but at
that moment uh I already was able to
earn some money uh doing some betting on

[37:16]
earn some money uh doing some betting on
um betting
sites like sports betting you mean yeah
sports betting but but it was not about
uh basically I wouldn't care which sport
uh I'm betting on and which team uh

[37:32]
uh I'm betting on and which team uh
nothing like that I would just care
about numbers and if you count fast and
well you can see the opportunities to
earn some
money without any um variance you

[37:47]
money without any um variance you
know but but so it's like uh I don't
know what what's the name for that
strategy in English but I I I I think
for sure uh lots of people uh would

[38:01]
for sure uh lots of people uh would
understand what I'm saying in Russia
language it's uh
VOR
so okay yeah these two strategies and um
you basically see the holes in um

[38:17]
you basically see the holes in um
betting in the numbers of betting s yeah
in odds yeah so you see the hols and you
use these hols to
uh how does one see the holes if you

[38:30]
uh how does one see the holes if you
like for example if you don't understand
the sport then it it has nothing to do
with the sport it's pure yeah I don't
care I'm yeah it's it's only about odds
you have to be able to calculate fast
and you have to be prepared so you would

[38:46]
and you have to be prepared so you would
this is just the strategy I I um I found
a guy who earned some money in um in our
doer and he had like lots of money and
he was uh living cool life and I was not
poor but I I was from family which uh

[39:03]
poor but I I was from family which uh
didn't have that much money and when I
uh came to Moscow I realized that I I
should earned money myself so um I was
trying to uh find something and when I

[39:15]
trying to uh find something and when I
met this guy I I I said like please
teach me and I would pay you back later
like it's actually funny because it's it
was like coaching for
profit yeah just like in porker and I

[39:32]
profit yeah just like in porker and I
did it was my first ever coaching for
profit and um he did uh teach me and I
paid him back like
$2,000 actually nice yeah and it was on

[39:46]
$2,000 actually nice yeah and it was on
my it was the end uh on my maybe second
year in the
University yeah and so I was able to
earn some money when I discovered
poker and I was doing that thing uh

[40:03]
poker and I was doing that thing uh
earning some money having parties uh
like that I was pretty okay at the
moment but uh I was thinking that I
should um take poker really serious

[40:15]
should um take poker really serious
because uh I love the game and uh this
sport betting thing it's uh it's kind of
silly
it's um you can't really work with that
in my opinion it's uh very

[40:31]
in my opinion it's uh very
uh like
um it's pretty boring and uh there is no
uh any creativity in that you just play
with numbers and if you put some hours

[40:45]
with numbers and if you put some hours
you would get some money and it's there
is
actually uh you cannot actually earn
really a lot amounts of money because
all the b in sides they they know that
there is such a thing and they would uh

[41:01]
there is such a thing and they would uh
struggle against that they would ban you
and uh yeah so I was consistently
getting bounded on uh some sites I
switched to another sites and stuff like
that so uh yeah I was earning pretty
good for student but uh I know I knew

[41:18]
good for student but uh I know I knew
for sure that I
wouldn't um just stay in that um in that
uh taking that as a work I would say
so um then I tried to do pocker and I uh

[41:38]
so um then I tried to do pocker and I uh
tried to to play seeden gos then I tried
to play cash games uh one then another

[41:46]
to play cash games uh one then another
and I didn't have much success then um
all of these betting things they went
pretty bad because I I got banned pretty
much from everywhere
and uh so I was

[42:01]
and uh so I was
already um in a habit of spending pretty
lot amount of money and having parties
and I enjoyed that life and I didn't
even notice how all of my money was gone

[42:16]
even notice how all of my money was gone
because um I usually uh it was really
easy for me to earn back but then I
realized that I cannot earn back because
I'm everywhere and uh all of my money
was gone because I was living pretty

[42:32]
was gone because I was living pretty
good life I would say in the
Dory so I had to go take poker seriously
and actually I would say that always I
knew that I would do that I was just uh

[42:47]
knew that I would do that I was just uh
I was just parting and like a bit later
yeah a bit later like one a year or so
um and actually because I spent all of
my money and uh I I didn't get any money

[43:03]
my money and uh I I didn't get any money
from my um parents that was my decision
I said it's in the first year of my
University so please don't send me
anything it's uh it's me who has to take

[43:15]
anything it's uh it's me who has to take
this
responsibility actually also because uh
when I uh mean parents I mean only my
mom so my uh dad died when I was young
and uh my mom already did lots of stuff
so uh I felt like uh I can't really take

[43:34]
so uh I felt like uh I can't really take
any money from her it would be like a
really bad thing for growing up
so um back to this moment uh when uh

[43:45]
so um back to this moment uh when uh
there is a crisis in my life I'm trying
to do poker but I cannot I'm playing
like
uh I I think I'm playing like around
zero because I uh loveed the game and I
spent lots of hours watching YouTube

[44:00]
spent lots of hours watching YouTube
videos some tutorials stuff like that
and I wasn't that bad I but I couldn't
earn money already um at that moment
so uh that was a tough period in my life
I even had to take some loan y yeah from

[44:18]
I even had to take some loan y yeah from
a friend of mine and then uh from
another friend and uh well became the
moment then uh I had some loans and I
don't have any money and it was really

[44:31]
don't have any money and it was really
tough times and um actually to uh jump
to take a jump um in poker I had to go
to the like a regular job first I go

[44:45]
to the like a regular job first I go
work like a promoter at the um entrance
of Subway I was just promoting some [ __ ]
and um yeah this actually great
experience because I realized uh that I

[45:00]
experience because I realized uh that I
was taking money too easy like yeah
you're taking it for granted that the
money with the sport bet came in so
easily yeah yeah yeah absolutely um
sorry I'm not that good speaker uh but I

[45:15]
sorry I'm not that good speaker uh but I
understand everything you say so please
help me with some words uh when you get
no worries no worries yeah I I took
everything for granted that's a good
phrase uh if you talk about my money
career and then um I met a friend of

[45:31]
career and then um I met a friend of
mine who uh explained me about one also
work which uh which is uh promoting but
not that uh it's promoting in schools it
was pretty hard to get this job and I
did lots of work to get the job and I

[45:46]
did lots of work to get the job and I
finally uh got it and it was pretty good
job um and I did it only to take some
money so I can uh have a jump in poker
so I can spend some money in poker and

[46:00]
so I can spend some money in poker and
having money U on the side to leave
on and when I get this job uh I spent
all of my money all of my effort on
pocker and doing this job and it was for

[46:15]
pocker and doing this job and it was for
half a year and I managed to earn enough
so I could leave on that and pay all of
the loans and uh on the side I was uh
trying to do my best at
poker and then was a moment I um managed

[46:33]
poker and then was a moment I um managed
to do pretty pretty good in that job and
I was earning like $3,000 per per month
something like that so it was pretty
good um at that moment and
um um my boss uh told me that I'm doing

[46:49]
um um my boss uh told me that I'm doing
good and I can go for like a bigger
advantage and uh um
I really remember this moment so I I

[47:00]
I really remember this moment so I I
told told her that uh I'm not here for
that I'm here only for money uh I want
to go play poker I always actually
wasn't afraid to say that uh I would
like to go play poker because I know
lots of guys they would say that they

[47:16]
lots of guys they would say that they
are working in it or something like that
I would always say like I'm playing
poker I want to go play poker poker is
fun and stuff like that and
I told her that um I want a quit to play

[47:30]
I told her that um I want a quit to play
poker and she said that uh actually we
would like to rent for you and our good
guys um really good flat in the center
of Moscow it was like crazy good back
then uh so they you can leave here leave

[47:47]
then uh so they you can leave here leave
there and do the job and please just go
there if you like it enough you probably
would stay and uh I went there it was on
arbat Street it was like a really big

[48:00]
arbat Street it was like a really big
flat and at that time me being from my
family I was like oh my god there are
such good Flats such a big one it's it
was really cool and I really remember uh
this moment because I spent the night

[48:17]
this moment because I spent the night
there we were partying and having fun
and in the morning um I woke up really
early and um I said to other guys who
actually also know knew about poker I

[48:31]
actually also know knew about poker I
said no no no for sure I'm going for
poker and I took all of my stuff go to
my boss and say you know what thank you
a lot but I'm going for poker right now
and I went to a really small room which

[48:47]
and I went to a really small room which
I lived in and started playing 50 ml
zoom and I was [ __ ] happy with that I
was just so happy that I decided to go
for poker and at that moment my bank row

[49:00]
for poker and at that moment my bank row
was
1,500 and I just switched to um um five
NL 500 NL 50 not 50050 zoom poer and I
was just enjoying doing that yeah and

[49:17]
was just enjoying doing that yeah and
was it was a start of my career and
after that I never did anything but
worker uh for a job did you have any you
mentioned with the Rubik cubing you I

[49:31]
mentioned with the Rubik cubing you I
think you mentioned like a Japanese guy
you saw fixing a Rubik Cube in like five
seconds or something on YouTube and you
were like hey so that's possible did you
have any role models like in poker or
was it just you had trust in yourself
like hey this is this is a thing and I'm

[49:45]
like hey this is this is a thing and I'm
just G to make this work or did you have
like a role model that you could look up
to like hey these people are doing it as
well so I can do this as well MH yeah I
wouldn't say that I had a role model but
I would say for sure that I spent a lot
of hours uh just reading uh some blocks

[50:04]
of hours uh just reading uh some blocks
of other people I I have to mention for
Haley I have to mention uh invoker and
uh Stefan so these guys are the guys who

[50:15]
uh Stefan so these guys are the guys who
motivated me a lot uh mostly Stefan
because he actually came to the top um
was coming to the top basically and the
moment when I started my
career uh like that so when I started he

[50:30]
career uh like that so when I started he
already was pretty good and during my
career he was becoming better and better
better and one thing I love about Stefan
is that he is
so straightforward guy he would always

[50:45]
so straightforward guy he would always
tell the whole Tru in his book like I'm
feeling really bad because I'm just such
a [ __ ] and stuff like that so he was
just so he was really honest and uh so
for Haley is was like really beautiful

[51:00]
for Haley is was like really beautiful
picture in his blog he's just so good
like that he he didn't try he didn't do
anything to look so cool but uh it's
just his style he looked really cool in

[51:15]
just his style he looked really cool in
his blog and inv Walker he looked like
fun and cool but Stefan would feel just
like a brother like like he is just in
the the same struggle as you and he had
like uh I think um really really

[51:32]
like uh I think um really really
important post for me is about him him
talking about his first ever huge down
swing because he was always like a huge
Crasher he would crash at eight BBS or

[51:47]
Crasher he would crash at eight BBS or
so
um and once he had a pretty big down
swing losing like m
I think
$40,000 or something playing basically

[52:00]
$40,000 or something playing basically
and he did lots of posts regarding that
and um uh these were the posts which I
came back to even

[52:15]
came back to even
now um I actually read it once one more
time last
year uh but I'm playing much higher than
Stefan was playing at that moment but
they still motivate me a lot especially

[52:31]
they still motivate me a lot especially
knowing um what he did after so yeah
Stefan is for sure probably the role
model would be him but I cannot say that
he was a role model because we are just
so
different um but he at least was he at

[52:47]
different um but he at least was he at
least was a motivating a motivation that
again showed you that despite times
being hard there is a light in the end
of the tunnel because like you said you
know you know where he came where he
where he ended up uh going and if you

[53:00]
where he ended up uh going and if you
read that post you know that in the end
it's going to be all right so you see
all the [ __ ] that he's been going
through you feel like [ __ ] but you know
Hey listen he he managed to turn it
around and so will
I yeah but actually at that moment which

[53:15]
I yeah but actually at that moment which
uh he he didn't already achieve
everything so when I first read it he
wasn't that good but I was just so so
sure that he would he would do it at the
end because of his um his attitude it's

[53:34]
end because of his um his attitude it's
just Stefan is just so crazy about this
game um I think like the best
explanation about Stefan and probably
the best uh reason why is he so creative

[53:49]
the best uh reason why is he so creative
and tough to play against is he just
doesn't care about money at all yeah
I think like and at the same time which
is so incredible that he's actually so

[54:03]
is so incredible that he's actually so
um like a reasonable guy when you met
him he read a lot he uh like practice a
lot do meditation stuff like that all

[54:15]
lot do meditation stuff like that all
that but when he's on table he is just
like doesn't care about money at all
yeah and um he just cares about
competition not even poker but
competition in poker like intelligence

[54:32]
competition in poker like intelligence
competition something like
that and yeah I really love that in him
so he's just so

[54:45]
uh he doesn't feel afraid as like he
doesn't feel afraid that he would go
broke or something he just doesn't
doesn't think in that way but um me for
example when uh I'm at the tables the um

[55:03]
example when uh I'm at the tables the um
main struggle for me is that I always um
scared that I can go broke that uh some
things can go bad so probably I

[55:16]
things can go bad so probably I
shouldn't BL here because I just will
burn my money right now and stuff like
that I uh
actually uh I I know that I uh watched
lots of YouTube videos from you and you

[55:30]
lots of YouTube videos from you and you
always say that you have uh to think
about your nature and uh uh you uh you
told that your nature is pretty like
passive so you should um pick more

[55:45]
passive so you should um pick more
aggressive options and like always
remember about that and I think most of
uh people coming to Poker are uh
natively very passive
and very
scared and step is the opposite yeah and

[56:04]
scared and step is the opposite yeah and
that's why he can't really be my role
model because we are such different guys
but for sure um I'm I respect him a lot

[56:16]
but for sure um I'm I respect him a lot
and I really like um the whole uh
journey of him in poker and U I was like
enough
to to be like uh to be during the

[56:31]
to to be like uh to be during the
Journey close enough to read all the
posts and to meet him in life and to
talk about strategy and poker
so yeah yeah actually I remember that uh

[56:47]
so yeah yeah actually I remember that uh
I remember actually that I actually had
one post from Stefan as well a long long
time ago that that I translated to
English and that I remember I used in
one of my coaching sessions I think it

[57:02]
one of my coaching sessions I think it
was I think it was when I'm trying to
remember whatst
sorry maybe about Predators sorry no it
I think it was something about
like uh stepping into like your

[57:18]
like uh stepping into like your
curiosity of the game and just freeing
yourself up and just doing whatever what
whatever comes natural to you be really
being intuitive I think it was like a
post when he he wasn't enjoying poker
that much and then suddenly he break he

[57:31]
that much and then suddenly he break he
break through and it's like listen I'm
now really curious about the game again
I'm interested I'm creative when I just
let uh let the game Flow when I have no
more expectations is was it was
something and I'm I'm throwing out a lot

[57:45]
something and I'm I'm throwing out a lot
of topics right now but it was something
along along those lines maybe I'll put
it in the description for people who are
interested maybe maybe if I can find it
back
somewhere I hope you guys are enjoying

[58:15]
weeks of January before we close the
program permanently so don't miss out go
over to mechanics ofp poker.com sign up
now and let me and Adam help you achieve
your poker course in 2024 I wanted to
actually switch it over to Adam now has
been Sil uh patient like he always is

[58:32]
been Sil uh patient like he always is
patient guy on the other side like we
were talking about uh even um Nikolai
was talking about risk aversion right
that naturally people are risk averse
and that's you actually see this back in
like data for example of population

[58:46]
like data for example of population
that's usually the general tendency is
to be more risk averse more passive
under Bluff over fold especially if you
look at lower Stakes like at higher
Stakes people have overcome these bias
or I guess naturally the people are less
risk averse they rise to the top maybe

[59:00]
risk averse they rise to the top maybe
that's the case what can people do to
beas risk
averse tough question well yeah I think
it's first of all important to know your
Tendencies and how risk averse you
generally are as you mentioned most of
us have somewhat passive Tendencies we

[59:16]
us have somewhat passive Tendencies we
go away from risk rather than into risk
and we like to hold on to our resources
of money and what we have and we don't
like put on the line and you're losing
it and generally for most people losing
feels twice as bad as winning feels good
so just know those things about yourself

[59:30]
so just know those things about yourself
just understand okay risk um feels
challenging for me and that's going to
hold me back if I don't go head-to-head
with it so what I get players to do is
basically understand in which areas do
you feel your passive Natures or your
aversion to risk are holding you back so

[59:45]
aversion to risk are holding you back so
Nikolai mentioned like basically scared
of losing money and that could impact
you in many ways that could impact you
shot taking that could impact um you
playing during the down swing so try to
look at the where those Tendencies show
up and try to really fight back against
those Tendencies so realizing like what
is it you're scared of with risk because

[1:00:00]
is it you're scared of with risk because
often it's quite Primal right so if we
look at risk and why we're afraid of it
we like hardwire like money into our
survival needs if I lose money like
Nikolai mentioned go broke go and bro
feels like I'm dead game over like
life's over for us so we build this
really strong Primal attachment to our

[1:00:17]
really strong Primal attachment to our
resources so we've we really do some
work on packing like why we're so
attached to money why we're so attached
to resources and then going head-to-head
with it and cre like little
controlled experiments where you take on
more risk where you challenge yourself
to step into risk but this is a

[1:00:30]
to step into risk but this is a
challenge for many players I haven't
really got like a a one second answer
other than to understand your Tendencies
and then to learn to a moreal risk and
realize that we can build tolerance I
can't say everyone can become a Stefan
and not care about money but you can
learn to acquire more tolerance for risk
I'm sure Rene yourself and Nicolai and

[1:00:46]
I'm sure Rene yourself and Nicolai and
anyone listening when you first started
your PO career the stakes you're
probably playing now the swings you have
day to day you couldn't imagine that was
possible that you'd be okay going to bed
at night going yay just lost 10K Life's
good your older self so you can build a
tolerance over time H but yeah you've

[1:01:00]
tolerance over time H but yeah you've
got to yeah kind of Step In into that
nature so yeah I really enjoyed your
story Nikolai really fascinating
listening to how you've developed the a
mindset going into poker and we've got
the story so far you're currently just
going into your PO career and playing
50nl so could you tell us about some of

[1:01:15]
50nl so could you tell us about some of
the early um maybe goals you had coming
into poker when you first start getting
curious about the game and yeah how did
you start to progress from your initial
curiosity into becoming a good winner
yeah actually thanks a lot for
everything you just said because you um

[1:01:32]
everything you just said because you um
summarize it really really good I think
and this um
phrase understand uh
your what you said sorry uh you have to
understand your

[1:01:47]
understand your
um your nature your Tendencies yeah your
nature your tendenc yeah understand your
Tendencies that's that's a really big
thing in and actually if I would have to
tell to give an advice I would say that

[1:02:00]
tell to give an advice I would say that
you have to understand your tendences
and reflect on that a lot because uh if
you want to have a breakthrough moment
it's about understanding and going
against it and building that confidence

[1:02:17]
against it and building that confidence
to uh go against it against your
nature okay so uh as for me back then
playing nl50 I think um firstly I was

[1:02:30]
playing nl50 I think um firstly I was
just really in love with the game and I
was um just uh playing a lot and I
always wanted to go uh at their biggest
St was always like my goal and uh I
think it's just uh luck that uh I always

[1:02:48]
think it's just uh luck that uh I always
wanted to go up because lots of people
feel comfortable enough at a pretty low
stake and I think that's that's a big
bad thing because Parker uh is a really

[1:03:01]
bad thing because Parker uh is a really
tough job and I think probably it's also
a dangerous job we just don't have um a
big sample enough yet to realize how
dangerous it can be I mean with uh us
sitting there having lots of stress uh

[1:03:17]
sitting there having lots of stress uh
moments and um uh having to deal with a
lot of um nervous moments when you just
uh have to ship like lots of money on

[1:03:30]
uh have to ship like lots of money on
the river and the guy thanks and you are
just please fold like that so lots of um
probably danger in poker I think and uh
just like I said I I love the game but I

[1:03:45]
just like I said I I love the game but I
understand that uh it's not a really
good job and it's not a dream job so uh
um what what I'm saying is that if you
feel that you are comfortable enough
playing like nl50 probably it's not a

[1:04:03]
playing like nl50 probably it's not a
good thing uh probably you either go up
or you just quit poker as rude as it uh
as r as it
sounds um

[1:04:16]
sounds um
because yeah um I think it's very bad to
spend all of uh your best years with
when you are so uh you can be so focused
you have lots of mental and uh physical

[1:04:31]
you have lots of mental and uh physical
strength um you you have lots of energy
and uh you have lots of opportunities uh
lots of time everything uh during your
20 to like 30 and to just spend that

[1:04:47]
20 to like 30 and to just spend that
plain and
l50 uh sorry but I think it's not a good
choice and um I always
when when somebody um ask me uh like uh

[1:05:00]
when when somebody um ask me uh like uh
what should I do I'm playing l50 I
always say like you should go up you you
should just try to go bigger stakes and
poker uh if you talk about cash poker
and I'm a cash poker uh player um it

[1:05:16]
and I'm a cash poker uh player um it
starts only on 200 an hour would say
before that it's just uh you shouldn't
really think
that it's your job yeah for sure you can
be from small town and in Russia lots of

[1:05:31]
be from small town and in Russia lots of
small really uh poor towns and $1,000 in
that town is just crazy lots of money
but uh still I think these years when

[1:05:45]
but uh still I think these years when
you are so good young and productive
probably it's better to spend that on
some different um
different opportunities different job so
yeah I was lucky that for some reason I

[1:06:01]
yeah I was lucky that for some reason I
always wanted to go on the bigger S
stake and um actually I would say that
back then uh I was a bit like Stefan but
not because of my nature it's just
because I was

[1:06:16]
because I was
so um I I really wanted to go bigger I
actually uh lots of my sessions were
like I'm playing nl50 uh I'm feeling
tired I'm done and I would open NL 100
zoom and I would like watch it forever

[1:06:32]
zoom and I would like watch it forever
till I want to go sleep and I would just
uh preparing for playing this steak I
would take some notes I would just uh
you know spend time watching it

[1:06:46]
you know spend time watching it
observing it and uh I did same all of my
career actually when I moved to 100 I
was just so focused on getting to 200 NL
I was short taken a lot and all this was

[1:07:01]
I was short taken a lot and all this was
just thinking about that I wasn't really
thinking about oh I just finally made
10,000 K and I would I want to just
spend it no I was always like okay it's
enough to go show taking 200l right

[1:07:16]
enough to go show taking 200l right
now uh and I think it's uh on luck that
um I'm in such
um in such I was in such mode um but

[1:07:30]
um in such I was in such mode um but
here now I'm realizing that it's very
important that you should be in that
kind of mode if you want to achieve
something in pocker
because if you want to just uh basically
um be able to earn $2,000 in poker and

[1:07:46]
um be able to earn $2,000 in poker and
that's like a dream uh yeah
probably you should try to do something
else as
I agree on all levels with that and what
do you think was driving you to want to

[1:08:00]
do you think was driving you to want to
play higher so myself I can definitely
relate to always looking at the level
above and almost like the next ladder to
go to and what's really nice about
online poker in particular there is like
a clear level system there's the next
level which normally double the buy in
and you just keep progressing
progressing to the the really higher

[1:08:15]
progressing to the the really higher
Stak so um for you your your goal was
always to keep climbing that ladder was
that driven by a nature of competition
against better opponents where you
trying to fulfill some sort of innate
feeling good about yourself and showing
to yourself you could be good at this
game what was driving this always quest

[1:08:30]
game what was driving this always quest
to want to go to that next
level yeah just like I mentioned I I
think I was just lucky and the whole
environment I grew up in uh it it may be
uh like that so um I the um the thing is

[1:08:49]
uh like that so um I the um the thing is
I I didn't even think why I want to go I
just it it was just like the only way to
go you know um and I think it's because
of my environment yeah just like you

[1:09:01]
of my environment yeah just like you
mentioned um this competition feeling in
me uh compet being
competitive um wanting to try to to
achieve something else and then

[1:09:17]
achieve something else and then
something else as well and uh yeah I
think it's only about my environment I
grew up in and that's that's it it just
uh the whole uh my experience before

[1:09:32]
uh the whole uh my experience before
made me like that and it's uh I feel
like that I'm lucky to be like that and
that's actually the reason which helped
me a lot back then because I managed to

[1:09:45]
me a lot back then because I managed to
achieve pretty reasonable
States uh actually really fast and
I uh I don't don't even remember me
playing like
nl25 NL 50

[1:10:00]
nl25 NL 50
NL well NL 100 Zoom I played some sample
but most of the limits were uh Gone um
and I don't even remember playing that I
remember me playing 400 to 1K now a lot

[1:10:15]
remember me playing 400 to 1K now a lot
that that was a big part of my career
but I wasn't playing uh really low uh
for a long period of time because I was
just crazy about uh going
up yeah I want you to take us back to a

[1:10:34]
up yeah I want you to take us back to a
law moment you mentioned earlier that it
was inspiring to hear stepan's blog of
him going through a really tough time
and I think the story you have for your
bad times as well can also Inspire other

[1:10:45]
bad times as well can also Inspire other
people listening so there was a time in
your career I think it was when you're
playing 400s to one cares where you were
100 bans under AV and your wife is
pregnant at the time take us back to
that time and what was going on yeah
that's a very very tough time in my

[1:11:01]
that's a very very tough time in my
poker career for sure that would be uh
the toughest time with like really
really big distance between the second
one so uh I already did play lots of

[1:11:15]
one so uh I already did play lots of
offline poker I I
went to play in SOI
and um
I um so I met lots of people and um back

[1:11:30]
I um so I met lots of people and um back
then I met uh Victor kudinov who is zus
91 and you had him on on the BT and I
think that was a great Po and thank you
very much for that because I know Victor
pretty good and he

[1:11:45]
pretty good and he
never uh was so open about his poker
career as he was on your Port so thank
you for that a lot and yeah I met Victor
and
we I wouldn't say that we were ever

[1:12:01]
we I wouldn't say that we were ever
friends and we are not friends now but
we always were in a good
relationship and
um um was a period my of my life I was
playing 400 to 1K it's was actually was

[1:12:16]
playing 400 to 1K it's was actually was
a really big period of my poker career I
I feel like I always played played this
lmit
and um I just um had pretty bad down
swing which uh I was running lots of

[1:12:32]
swing which uh I was running lots of
under EV it was like
100 um pins under EV
and also I know now and um I'm sure now
that I was playing too bad and too

[1:12:46]
that I was playing too bad and too
passive in that time because it was the
first time and um was really hard to not
to
um to become a bad player at that moment

[1:13:00]
um to become a bad player at that moment
so I think uh you have to understand
that when you have a huge down swing the
struggle is not about lose not that much
money and like stuff like that the
struggle is not about losing too much of

[1:13:17]
struggle is not about losing too much of
your win rate I would say because like
uh usually when you have five
BBS win rate you can play like two BBS
or even lower when you have huge down

[1:13:30]
or even lower when you have huge down
swing and you have to think about that
constantly when you are in the down
swing the the main goal for you right
now is not to lose your wind rate um so
it's about strategy I mean also you have

[1:13:45]
it's about strategy I mean also you have
to do lots of mental things but I'm not
talking about that right now uh if you
talk about strategy things you have not
to lose your win rate in that moment
because it's easy to lose that you you

[1:14:00]
because it's easy to lose that you you
just skip some spots you just not Bluff
you just not call stuff like that and
then you just ruin your win rate and
this trick can go forever because you
are not 5db player anymore you are 1db

[1:14:16]
are not 5db player anymore you are 1db
player right now and yeah well good luck
with that so I think at that time I had
like five or six BBs at pretty big
sample so I was pretty good player but

[1:14:31]
sample so I was pretty good player but
uh when I first hit this down swing it
was really big down swing and actually
my wife just got pregnant and lots of
stuff on the side
and um it was tough for me to maintain

[1:14:47]
and um it was tough for me to maintain
the pork level at the tables and I'm
sure that I lost a a lot of my win rate
there
um so that's why actually this down

[1:15:00]
um so that's why actually this down
swing was going for that big period of
my life it was I think it was like half
a year and um I mentioned Victor because
he helped me a lot in that
period

[1:15:15]
period
um uh we discuss a lot of Poker but and
not so about strategy poker but poker
environment and um
he told me like really good and

[1:15:31]
he told me like really good and
important words back then and I'm
grateful for that it wasn't something
special and crazy it wasn't like
strategic moment which switched my life
uh no it was just U basically being uh

[1:15:47]
uh no it was just U basically being uh
the poker friend uh poker mate because
nobody else would understand understand
me that good as he at that
moment um he also

[1:16:00]
moment um he also
um his his son is one year
um one year more than mine uh one year
older yeah so he just basically was in
the same situation before me and he

[1:16:17]
the same situation before me and he
understand me really good and also he
was a be a better player uh than me and
and him saying like you're good enough
you will go through that you just uh you
just chill brother uh if if it goes

[1:16:32]
just chill brother uh if if it goes
really bad uh I can stake you and you
can play or so just don't worry and all
of the these words they were really
important at that moment

[1:16:45]
important at that moment
and uh
I to get through that I realized that I
should probably just just um take this L
rate thing back and to have the
confident back I went back to 200 NL

[1:17:01]
confident back I went back to 200 NL
which I I didn't play for a lot
of for a long period uh mainly I was
playing higher but I went to 200 NL and
um I was basically just uh doing lots of

[1:17:17]
um I was basically just uh doing lots of
rars even heads up um I was playing with
no select
absolutely no so I I play I would play
like everyone on 200l because I was

[1:17:30]
like everyone on 200l because I was
confident enough in that games and I
think that was really good decision to
go there because I'm sure that at that
moment I was a really bad player in um
higher limits but on 200 I was like come
on you will be destroyed for sure that

[1:17:47]
on you will be destroyed for sure that
that's a big d right here and uh yeah I
did great to now uh I think lots of that
regarding to having up swing but um

[1:18:01]
regarding to having up swing but um
actually also I think I was good enough
player so I just um managed to do like
nine BBS or something uh playing lots of
tables like everyone and I played I
don't remember exactly maybe 200 or 300

[1:18:16]
don't remember exactly maybe 200 or 300
hands um earned some money earned some
confidence went back and um
yeah it was really tough but very
important lesson in my
life and yeah this is

[1:18:31]
life and yeah this is
very the really funny thing is that now
I'm grateful for that even though it was
really hard and um I'm not sure but I
think there were moments than I even

[1:18:46]
think there were moments than I even
cried I'm not sure but probably I don't
remember exactly but but I think I was
really close and maybe I even cried one
or two times and you have to understand
that um in Russia uh man cannot cry oh

[1:19:03]
that um in Russia uh man cannot cry oh
no no no no no it's not a man you never
cry you just go through it and stuff
like that so I mean it was really tough
but now I'm grateful for that because it
taught me a lot and now when I can just

[1:19:17]
taught me a lot and now when I can just
reflect on that I think um it's a big
and important lesson
uh I think life teaches you lessons
through through challenges and yeah it
was really important what you said there
as well which I want to double back on

[1:19:30]
as well which I want to double back on
where you mentioned during a downswing
it's important not to lose your win rate
and this is really crucial because as
you mentioned you were 100 buyings under
EV for this long period I think you
mentioned six months but your win rate
going into that b into that down swing

[1:19:45]
going into that b into that down swing
changes as you go through it so you
mentioned being a 5bb winner but as
you're going through that down swing all
of a sudden you're losing confidence
you're being more passive or your
tendencies that are your negative
Tendencies are getting magnified
emotions are there you're not playing
the same game so all of a sudden like
what was variance to begin with now is

[1:20:01]
what was variance to begin with now is
getting compounded because your win
rates now went to 2bb or 1bb or even
negative in extreme scenarios so um I'm
really curious to know like the lessons
you've learned from that or or how do
you maintain your win rate during a down
swing if I could say that you're right
you're going to keep your 5bb win rate

[1:20:16]
you're going to keep your 5bb win rate
and just keep playing and it'll even out
I think most people be like oh my God
thank you yes I would I'll keep playing
through it but the the challenge is am I
still winning do I still have a 5day win
rate so for you how do what do you do
going forward now in your career to
maintain your win rate during times of

[1:20:31]
maintain your win rate during times of
low
confidence yeah uh I'm really um I'm
really grateful that we are discussing
that right now because um if I can help
poker

[1:20:46]
poker
professionals uh probably it's uh that
that that thing about not losing your
win rate in your down swings because
it's like a huge huge part of your
career and if if you want to go for the
top results uh you have to work a lot on

[1:21:01]
top results uh you have to work a lot on
that so right now as for me I I just
realize that
um it's really important to rest and um
well I love the game like I mentioned

[1:21:16]
well I love the game like I mentioned
and it's not easy for me but I have to
take uh weak off or each each week I
have one uh day off and I have to do it

[1:21:30]
have one uh day off and I have to do it
lots of times I'm like oh I feel great I
want to play but no no I have to take
that off and um like in two or three
months I would always take three or five

[1:21:45]
months I would always take three or five
uh days
off and yeah
um um I'm trying I would try to explain
it as good
um uh as I can but it's a very important

[1:22:02]
um uh as I can but it's a very important
thing so uh like I see it is that let's
say you have 5 BB in rate if you don't
uh rest if you just play play play uh

[1:22:15]
uh rest if you just play play play uh
for sure because you are a human your
rate would go down the more you play uh
the more it would go down for sure I
think it's not um it's impossible to
just maintain your win rate playing like

[1:22:32]
just maintain your win rate playing like
100 Days with no
break
so I think um taking this um rest is
really important so you can focus not

[1:22:45]
really important so you can focus not
from not on money but on your strategy
on the game because when you play a lot
uh just being a human you you would
start to think about
money uh it's always like that um

[1:23:02]
money uh it's always like that um
especially if you have down swing um at
some moment you would be like money
money money money you don't even realize
it but it's like surrounding
you and to take this off you have to

[1:23:18]
you and to take this off you have to
rest uh when you rest and you came back
to the PO tables you you are already um
like bored enough you you want to go

[1:23:30]
like bored enough you you want to go
play you want to battle because poker is
so emotional game and just uh as human
brain works uh you would uh want to get
these emotions back and um you would

[1:23:48]
these emotions back and um you would
even feel it um that you really want to
get back so uh when you have arrest and
you uh go back um from arrest to pocket
tables uh I think you are in like best

[1:24:03]
tables uh I think you are in like best
shape as as
um as crazy as it sounds I I didn't
think that
um so we discussed that with uh Victor

[1:24:16]
um so we discussed that with uh Victor
kin and um so we uh came back to this
this to to the conclusion that if we
take poker player right now who is
already good enough let's say a 1K

[1:24:32]
already good enough let's say a 1K
wck uh and um he would just quit poker
right now for month or two month or
three month when he cames back it takes
like two weeks for him to uh be able to

[1:24:46]
like two weeks for him to uh be able to
play as good again but the funniest
thing is that he probably would play
even better than than he was previously
because the more you
play uh
there worse your uh focus on the game

[1:25:05]
there worse your uh focus on the game
and the more you're focusing on other
stuff and you can even get bought and
like watch YouTube uh sound uh some

[1:25:15]
like watch YouTube uh sound uh some
music and would chat with friends
because you're ready to bought you you
played a lot and it's like blah blah
blah it's the same the same routine and
U to get to that level when you are in

[1:25:30]
U to get to that level when you are in
the game completely and you focused
really really well uh you have to take
rest
so uh actually I remember that in

[1:25:45]
so uh actually I remember that in
2018 uh I was at that period of my
career with when I uh didn't do any
breaks so I would have a day off only if
I'm Ill and if I'm Ill bad because if
I'm just uh feeling a bit weak it's okay

[1:26:03]
I'm just uh feeling a bit weak it's okay
I can just play like lower let's say and
um I had my
first big uh trip to Bali and with um

[1:26:16]
first big uh trip to Bali and with um
with
girlfriend uh who became my wife
after and I thought like I should I
should take my laptop so so I play every
day at least one hour or so because I
have to maintain my

[1:26:32]
have to maintain my
poker Um poker shape can you say like
that so and uh I I did manage to play
every day absolutely every day and now I
feel absolutely different about that I

[1:26:46]
feel absolutely different about that I
think
that uh it's not that easy as you think
to to lose your poker
shape but uh when you have a rest you're
doing better for your poker

[1:27:01]
doing better for your poker
game um because brain is
pretty
complexed uh yeah it's um lots of thing
would um are really important when you

[1:27:16]
would um are really important when you
play porker lots of things lots of small
details are really important and uh um I
think every player player would agree
that uh you can if there is a scale like
Z to 100 your play every day would uh

[1:27:33]
Z to 100 your play every day would uh
differ a lot so you can play at 50 uh
you can play at 70 you can play at 90 or
you can play at 100 and yeah win rate is

[1:27:45]
you can play at 100 and yeah win rate is
really different in these periods so to
be able to play your best
uh and uh not to be scared not to
be
um not to think about money too much not

[1:28:02]
um not to think about money too much not
to think about uh which period are you
in how big the down swing is and stuff
like that uh it's only able when you are
interested in your poker game as a
strategic game like there is no money

[1:28:16]
strategic game like there is no money
behind it you just want to play you just
wanna you just W to destroy your
opponent you just wanna level up
him you just
wanna understand how he thinks so it's

[1:28:30]
wanna understand how he thinks so it's
only about competition when it's like
that uh you don't want to like play
YouTube on the side of your screen right
you you you want to be in the hand you w
to you want to be
really um focused on on that

[1:28:48]
really um focused on on that
so yeah I think rest rest and having day
offs is really really important in your
pocket career and now I uh I
feel different about that and I so I

[1:29:03]
feel different about that and I so I
have like a pretty hard
routine um
like no no I have like a schedule right
so and it's I cannot really move away

[1:29:19]
so and it's I cannot really move away
from that schedule a lot and I even even
if let's say there is a really good game
right now I think like I can so easily

[1:29:31]
right now I think like I can so easily
lose my win rate at some moment so that
all of my hours which I put in are like
worth zero you know like let's say your
win rate is 5 five

[1:29:47]
win rate is 5 five
BBS if you are in not such a good shape
it becomes four four BBS if you are on
your best shape it's like six six BBS or
maybe seven BBS uh those are just
approximate numbers the thing I want to

[1:30:02]
approximate numbers the thing I want to
say is that sometimes when you feel like
no I should play a bit more probably
these bat more hours are worth zero
because you just lose them because uh on

[1:30:15]
because you just lose them because uh on
the bigger picture you
play worse you know mhm so now I
I um I see that like that so you you
should try to maintain uh and I'm not

[1:30:31]
should try to maintain uh and I'm not
that guy who says like if you play you
play only a game right you if you don't
feel like a game just quit the tables no
no it's it's different it's about being
able to maintain the best you can but if

[1:30:45]
able to maintain the best you can but if
you have like let's say I did the
mistake I'm not breaking my session it's
fine all of the the mistakes are already
on my uh win rate result it's absolutely
fine it's just uh just the process but

[1:31:01]
fine it's just uh just the process but
um if I don't do any breaks if I just
keep playing poker I I'm pretty sure
that I would lose my win rate and uh
playing like 100 hours or playing 150

[1:31:15]
playing like 100 hours or playing 150
hours can be the same at the result but
you could spend these 50 hours
much better than just playing poker for
like zero amount you know and um also I

[1:31:30]
like zero amount you know and um also I
think that practice in in poker is very
important and actually it's important in
uh any other uh in any hour part of life
practicing is uh it's it's all about
practice

[1:31:45]
practice
but uh I think in poker you have um to
take some rest it's
yeah um I hope that I um I explained
good enough because um that's like a

[1:32:02]
good enough because um that's like a
that's like a really big thing which I
would like to share to um our poker
professionals who maybe already in the
state of mind like I should just play
play play play play it's it's a bit more

[1:32:17]
play play play play it's it's a bit more
complicated than you think yeah and
actually when I started to uh take some
rest uh and like you know reload your uh

[1:32:31]
rest uh and like you know reload your uh
poker brain um
I find myself a lot in the situations
when uh I'm like oh I can do like that
and probably it would work like that

[1:32:45]
and probably it would work like that
blah blah blah and then I'm playing such
a great hand which I never played and I
don't know know why I came up with that
but when I take this rest my brain is
work Works in uh pretty different State

[1:33:02]
work Works in uh pretty different State
uh with all the poker poker environment
poker videos po studies all of that
poker poker poker which is in my life
and it's just

[1:33:15]
and it's just
like
consolidates sorry yeah your mind
consolidates the information that yeah
yeah yeah that's a good word right now
yeah yeah exactly
so when you take rest um and even better

[1:33:32]
so when you take rest um and even better
is uh you take rest and after going back
to the tables uh before that you do some
study um you rest you study and you go
to the tables and you would crush I can
tell you for sure uh you would crush

[1:33:47]
tell you for sure uh you would crush
yeah that that's best ever advice I
could possibly get
yeah if somebody would tell me that um
deep enough that I would understand it

[1:34:00]
deep enough that I would understand it
and I would feel it I would be in uh
much much better poker uh situation
right now for sure I think it's great
advice and the way we were talking about
it I was trying to visually think about

[1:34:16]
it I was trying to visually think about
as you play more and more hours your win
rate kind of getting less when you're
not taking breaks and then a a a break
kind of reset your win rate it almost
gets it back to where it was and I think
that's really important to know like as
a high performer who wants to get more
out of yourself that you can't just keep
logging in hours day after day without

[1:34:31]
logging in hours day after day without
recovery or your win rate will start to
drop so you need to like fit into
recovery into a system to allow yourself
to get back and reset your kind of win
rates back to where they were but also
as you mentioned when you take breaks
you don't just go back to Baseline you
regain curiosity because you're playing

[1:34:45]
regain curiosity because you're playing
every day you get a bit more bored and
mundane but when you take breaks you
come back with fresh ideas and your
brain also learns in consolid
information when we're doing other
things when we're not in the act of
doing something during recovery time in
particular so there's also like an
Adaptive response of take recovery so

[1:35:00]
Adaptive response of take recovery so
yeah I was the same because myself I did
Super no leite volume for two years in a
row there was one year where I played
335 days of 10 to 12 hours every day and
exactly what you said happened to me
during the last like three months of the
year when I head to play to get my rake

[1:35:15]
year when I head to play to get my rake
back and I couldn't take days off my win
rate just went down down down down I
remember looking back on those last stre
months going I didn't play those three
months it wouldn't have made much of a
difference and it was like it was so
disheartening because I had other
friends who were high win rate players
playing a quarter of the hour's ey was
over the course of the year and their

[1:35:30]
over the course of the year and their
grass were like great and I went for
this really super high volume at the
stakes I was playing and it was just a
it was not understand exactly what you
talked about didn't understand recovery
didn't understand rest didn't understand
the mind isn't a machine and it needs to
uh yeah it requires fatigue it needs to
rest and recover and yeah I think for

[1:35:46]
rest and recover and yeah I think for
most players in a down swing there's one
or two things happen either they'll want
to play through and get back their money
quickly so they'll almost like play Bad
volume as you mentioned not take
recovery or they'll just like want to
just study all the time and not play at
all just I want to learn more stuff get

[1:36:00]
all just I want to learn more stuff get
more certainty about the game and then
I'll come back to it but as you
mentioned some just getting away from
the game taking a break I think what you
were talked about is two things one a
strategic weekly break so one day off a
week works for you for everyone
listening find your kind of weekly
sustainable kind of work to uh break

[1:36:15]
sustainable kind of work to uh break
ratio but find a sustainable kind of
routine but then also like when things
aren't going well just take a step back
take a step back from the game and then
come back with some studying and then
back into playing so yeah I think it's
really really good advice and I'm the
same I have the same motivation and
enthusiasm for recovery for performance

[1:36:32]
enthusiasm for recovery for performance
and I think once people understand it
and like as you mentioned feel it for
themselves you don't go back because
once you realize I'm more Curious I
perform at a higher level I have less
stress I have more tolerance for
emotions because I'm well rested ah why
would I not have that as part of a

[1:36:45]
would I not have that as part of a
systemized approach to my days and lives
H maybe I should so yeah anyone
listening hopefully someone some people
will go away from this and think about
how they currently um approach recovery
and start to re re reevaluate so for you
when you are trying to rest let's say on
this 100 buying downwing in particular

[1:37:00]
this 100 buying downwing in particular
what are some of the things that you did
away from the tables anything you do in
particular to uh allow yourself to
switch off because some players struggle
with breaks because their minds always
thinking about Po and they struggle to
give them some any downtime so anything
you do in
particular

[1:37:15]
particular
yeah uh once more thanks a lot you you
do a really great job to um consolidate
right all of my thoughts um that was
really great conclusion and thanks a lot

[1:37:30]
really great conclusion and thanks a lot
for that so as for me also I would like
to mention that uh one more advice uh
for down SN is uh going back not only
for the rest but going back on your
limits as well if you uh feel that you

[1:37:46]
limits as well if you uh feel that you
are stressed enough already that you are
just like I don't want to play this
[ __ ] game like all of that uh like
really bad environment already uh you
just please please go down in

[1:38:01]
just please please go down in
Stace uh please don't feel like if you
go down you are a loser and if you go
down you lose some EV all of these
things are really really uh bad and they

[1:38:17]
things are really really uh bad and they
they don't help you they do the
opposite if you go down uh in uh
Stakes uh you can play only like a week
but you would build a lot of confidence

[1:38:31]
but you would build a lot of confidence
back and this would help a lot to get
this win rate win rate back and if your
win rate is back to the uh good amount
or to the good number you would uh

[1:38:45]
or to the good number you would uh
like go from a Downs much more faster
like if you been rate in bad condition
you would be in down swing much more
Peri much more time when your win rate
is good

[1:39:00]
is good
enough yeah and
um um sorry what was your
question no very very important and yeah
I like that you uh yeah brought that as
well because I think some players get
too stubborn you spend a lot of time
moving up staks and to move down seems

[1:39:16]
moving up staks and to move down seems
like a um almost like a step backwards
when in reality as you mentioned like
confidence is so important like always
people underestimate how important it is
to be confident in your game confident
in your strategy and when you lose
confidence Pock is like the hardest game
in the world and everything feels
against you so need step back and like

[1:39:31]
against you so need step back and like
rebuild that confidence in in a safe
environment like droping down Stakes
almost like oh awesome like as you
mentioned you want a down swing a big
one you move down stakes and you're
playing Fearless you're like right Lord
everybody up let's go because your
confidence at that level was is a good
environment a safe environment for you
to re explore strategy get curious again

[1:39:47]
to re explore strategy get curious again
you weren't losing tons of money that
you were used to losing at higher Stakes
so it's like a play environment to to
regain
confidence yeah uh I remembered you you
asked about my uh routine when I take a
break I think and uh yeah I have to

[1:40:03]
break I think and uh yeah I have to
mention sport um because sport is also a
very big part of your PO poker
professional career I think and now uh I
have an injury because I went to play

[1:40:18]
have an injury because I went to play
soccer and yeah well I'm too old for
soccer probably because uh in my three
last years I had too much injuries from

[1:40:30]
last years I had too much injuries from
that game and now I'm sitting here
having no spot for two months because
what doctor said me and I feel much more
different because I don't do any sports
and uh um at least I have to mention

[1:40:46]
and uh um at least I have to mention
that my stamina right it goes down a lot
I can when I'm in good enough uh shape I
can easily play like seven hours session
and uh it's easy for me and if I do any

[1:41:02]
and uh it's easy for me and if I do any
sports right now I'm like in four on
fourth hour of my session I'm like oh
I'm [ __ ] tired I want to go sleep and
and I finish my session and I feel like
I cannot do anything so um funny thing

[1:41:20]
I cannot do anything so um funny thing
that poker sport doesn't take your
stamina but it takes it gives it back
for some reason I don't know how it

[1:41:30]
for some reason I don't know how it
works exactly I'm not a specialist
but yeah please do some Sport and um you
can choose lots of sports right there
you can you can go play tennis you can
go play soccer basketball volleyball you

[1:41:46]
go play soccer basketball volleyball you
can do the gym you can do lots of stuff
you just have to pick uh the one you
like you can do swimming as well
swimming is actually kind of fun so uh
from my poker experience if you do sport
it's much easier much better and also

[1:42:02]
it's much easier much better and also
talking about down swings it's easier to
get through them when you do some sport
because when you are playing like let's
say basketball you you only care about

[1:42:15]
say basketball you you only care about
throwing the ball into the basket and
that's the only thing you you don't care
about not nothing at all uh but doing
the goal and it's it's crazy good so
it's like a

[1:42:30]
it's like a
meditation uh and I think
now everybody already heard how it's
good for the brain to recover and do
meditation all that stuff yoga uh but

[1:42:46]
meditation all that stuff yoga uh but
yeah sport is like the best and easy
meditation and now I feel lots of
different lots of difference and I
wouldn't say that I'm like sports fan
and uh I'm like a so strong guy I do

[1:43:01]
and uh I'm like a so strong guy I do
lots of sport it's not about me but uh I
do some Sport All of My Life um and I
feel a lot of difference when I do and
then I don't and when you play poker a

[1:43:16]
then I don't and when you play poker a
lot of time it takes too much energy and
um
and time from you so you would say like
I can't go sport right now it's not a
good time um it's too much poker for me

[1:43:30]
good time um it's too much poker for me
right now I'm just so stressed I'm just
so focused I'm just uh I cannot do sport
right now please later but that's that's
a big mistake which I did thousand times
already and now um I see that difference

[1:43:48]
already and now um I see that difference
much more because I just became older I
just did um a lot I I I just had more
experience now I'm like I just own 29
and it's been nine years in my poker

[1:44:02]
and it's been nine years in my poker
career and now I just see these things
more clearly and I'm sure that in five
or three or five years I would feel like
I'm stupid at this moment uh and it's

[1:44:16]
I'm stupid at this moment uh and it's
just the way life goes but right now I I
see this
um that I was so mistaken when I prefer
only to focus on poker and don't do

[1:44:30]
only to focus on poker and don't do
anything else and I have to mention that
if you for example don't want to do any
sport you just hate Sports and there are
some people who are like that I'm sure I
know some um please just uh just go walk

[1:44:45]
know some um please just uh just go walk
on the street uh you can you can listen
to the pot for example in your
headphones just just go walk
uh somewhere or or or do don't do the
running if you don't want to run just

[1:45:01]
running if you don't want to run just
just walk please and it would uh help a
lot in your poker um appearance yeah
because you you play much much better
when uh you do something like that sport

[1:45:16]
when uh you do something like that sport
or walking yeah please just walk for an
hour let's say and when you go back uh
I'm sure that you would crush I I can
even uh I don't remember the word so

[1:45:31]
even uh I don't remember the word so
um yeah I can guarantee that you would
crash yeah just please do it yeah and
actually for me um that's a big really
big mistake of me during all of my poker
career because before poker I did much

[1:45:48]
career because before poker I did much
more Sport and all of my poker career
I'm like oh no no not right now I'm I'm
too focused on poker I have to be really
good at poker I have to put hours in

[1:46:00]
good at poker I have to put hours in
it's not about sports right now please
please later but that's a mistake yeah
yeah I think it's understanding that the
body is built to move and that the brain
as an organ requires the body to be
healthy to some degree obviously we've
got like nutrients going to the brain

[1:46:15]
got like nutrients going to the brain
we've got our hearts pumping blood we've
got our lungs taking oxygen if you think
about like energy as you mentioned like
we think like of going to the gym or
exercising as taking energy but on the
long term we gain energy because the
systems that generate energy get
upgraded so I'm sure anyone can relate
to this they've done exercise for a
period of time they feel fitter they

[1:46:31]
period of time they feel fitter they
feel healthier they start playing poker
they can concentrate for longer they can
focus for longer because yeah you've
kind of f tune the systems that allow
you to have more energy so I think it
kind of takeway for a lot of players is
find ways to be active in your days and
some challenging like a a lot of players
will sit their computers all day or

[1:46:45]
will sit their computers all day or
they're in a casino all day if they're
Live players and just trying to find
time to be active and like you said it
doesn't have to be boring stuff do the
things you like but also just be active
moving like a walk in the morning A Walk
in the evening doing things just to get
the body moving and blood flow going is
just so so important for your mental

[1:47:00]
just so so important for your mental
health but also your long-term yeah
physiology in terms of being to play at
a high level I really think as you get
Aller like I'm see all day in a very
loose terms here 30 to 50 you need to
start thinking more about how to keep
the body active to keep the energy high
in your 20s you kind of get away with it

[1:47:16]
in your 20s you kind of get away with it
you can just you have high energy even
when you you do nothing and then you
start of take for granted and I speak to
a lot of people who uh start telling
themselves stories in the 30s going oh
yeah this time got the energy I used to
have in my 20s I'm like yeah cuz you
don't exercise anymore used to exercise
in your 20s or do stuff so yeah just

[1:47:30]
in your 20s or do stuff so yeah just
finding ways to uh yeah keep ourselves
moving keep ourselves active and
realizing even as a poker player even if
you don't care one bit about what your
body looks like it's going to help you
longterm to perform better focus at a
high level and be happier going forward
so with you I've got one a bit of a
paradox in my mind which I want to

[1:47:46]
paradox in my mind which I want to
clarify so um when you first got into
poker and you're moving up Stakes you
you mentioned that you wen't think about
money and you are quite fearless and
it's going to Next Level next level but
then you also mentioned at one point
that scared of going broke and being
passive is kind of built into your

[1:48:00]
passive is kind of built into your
hardware and your nature a little bit so
talk me through where they collided so
let's say you started out in Pocket not
really caring about the money but at
some point I'm guessing there's a
collision course with your your nature
being more risk ofers and how how's that
played
out yeah I think uh that uh this my

[1:48:16]
out yeah I think uh that uh this my
sport Bing uh environment helped me a
lot because when I was going up uh this
like 3,000 5,000 10,000 bank roll uh it
didn't feel like a success yet it feel

[1:48:32]
didn't feel like a success yet it feel
it felt like uh only just a
step and um so it wasn't like a big
amount of money for me but when I
reached like 100k uh that's when fear uh

[1:48:46]
reached like 100k uh that's when fear uh
fear uh approached me I I remember OT Ro
right
that's so he's like a mindset coach in
poker environment and um I remember his

[1:49:02]
poker environment and um I remember his
um one of his video I actually watched
lots of actually Lots tons of poker
stuff so I basically watch everything I
know all of the players of all countries

[1:49:15]
know all of the players of all countries
so that's what I'm talking when I um say
that I poker so OT uh once mentioned
that 100K is like the
most usual struggle for all of the poker

[1:49:31]
most usual struggle for all of the poker
players and uh yeah I would definitely
agree with that that's that's was my my
also struggle uh so when you first get
100K you feel like it's already pretty

[1:49:46]
100K you feel like it's already pretty
good and when you go to like 95 from 100
you feel like oh my god oh no no no it's
so bad I I should play 100 and 100 so I
could uh never lose to like 90 so yeah I

[1:50:03]
could uh never lose to like 90 so yeah I
think my nature is uh is pretty passive
and uh I I get scared a lot of going
broke and it just uh because before 100K

[1:50:17]
broke and it just uh because before 100K
the money wasn't so big that I would be
scared to lose but as it gets bigger the
um the more fear comes in

[1:50:31]
um the more fear comes in
so yeah this is just a struggle you have
to go with and just like you said you
have to understand your uh your nature
and uh build uh tolerance against it you

[1:50:47]
and uh build uh tolerance against it you
you have to reflect a lot and as for me
I I do lots of
um uh I just um made some voices uh to
myself when I go walking where I explain

[1:51:03]
myself when I go walking where I explain
like for example right now so we just uh
have been on vacation with my family for
seven days so just like I mentioned I do
rest and um uh now I'm okay I'm back to

[1:51:17]
rest and um uh now I'm okay I'm back to
play poker probably I would start
tomorrow I'm not sure uh because of some
other
stuff uh and yeah I I also want to say
that before starting playing poker after

[1:51:31]
that before starting playing poker after
rest uh I for sure should do some
studies so I already uh did um some uh
GTO wizard studies I played with u
trainer right and um yeah so I just

[1:51:47]
trainer right and um yeah so I just
um uh remembered all of the spots and I
feel prepared I feel uh that uh I miss
poer I I want to play and now I have to
be prepared mentally so I made voice to

[1:52:02]
be prepared mentally so I made voice to
myself where where I say like now you
want to go play but you have to be
prepared that in the first week you play
you you might lose 100K and you have to
take it um as a professional you you

[1:52:18]
take it um as a professional you you
have to know that it's possible it's not
like a trategy uh this is just part of
uh the game of your profession and so

[1:52:30]
uh the game of your profession and so
all of my career I do lots of voices
like that to myself I never even um
listened to them uh I think I listened
back to one or maybe two of them but I

[1:52:45]
back to one or maybe two of them but I
do that a lot and this is just kind of
reflection for myself
um which helps a lot because my my
nature uh
is at the same time is good for poker
because I'm not a gambler like I would

[1:53:02]
because I'm not a gambler like I would
go play too high of a limit or I would
I'm not a tilted person for example I'm
pretty lucky not to get tilted like uh
it's very hard uh to uh reach that uh

[1:53:19]
it's very hard uh to uh reach that uh
moment in my porker session that I would
be like I [ __ ] hate this game uh blah
blah blah so it's pretty easy for me
let's say if I start the session and I

[1:53:30]
let's say if I start the session and I
lose like three binds in five minutes I
would probably be like oh okay well not
a good start right and just laugh at it
and it's luck that I'm like that
probably it's also environment and box
and all that stuff but at this at one

[1:53:46]
and all that stuff but at this at one
time I'm pretty lucky to be uh that good
person mentally for poker but at the
same time my nature is very bad for
poker because I'm just so
scared person I mean I just um I'm

[1:54:02]
scared person I mean I just um I'm
so um conservative person right that
there World um so I I always want to be
like in Comfort not not danger not to

[1:54:16]
like in Comfort not not danger not to
risk too much and stuff like that but in
po profession is it's I would say if you
pick two person and one of them is just
a crazy mad and the other is just so um

[1:54:31]
a crazy mad and the other is just so um
like so calm and uh so strategic and
stuff like that the first one is either
go broke or go crazy good and the second
one would be like 200l free BB player

[1:54:47]
one would be like 200l free BB player
for his whole life it's it's
uh it's very often like that yeah and so
me uh from my nature is a 200 nl3 BB

[1:55:01]
me uh from my nature is a 200 nl3 BB
player and to get through that I I have
to do lots of work both mentally
physically uh sport uh environment
worker studing lots of that and I'm not

[1:55:15]
worker studing lots of that and I'm not
saying that uh I'm such a good worker
and uh
uh I'm not trying to say that uh look at
me I'm uh that good I'm just saying that
you have to understand this nature and

[1:55:30]
you have to understand this nature and
uh if your nature is that passive you
have to do lots of work in poker
because your nature is not good for
poker
in strategic way yeah so strategically

[1:55:46]
in strategic way yeah so strategically
uh I'm pretty bad nature yeah yeah great
great advice great advice and I really
like the audios as well I think that's
very practical and not even playing the
back as you mentioned just doing it as
almost like replacing journaling like

[1:56:00]
almost like replacing journaling like
writing journaling but it's getting your
thoughts out and I thought it's very
powerful actually the way you explain
that because it's a toolkit for dealing
with risk and building more risk
tolerance because what you were doing is
you were coming to terms with the worst
case scenario right and if you think

[1:56:15]
case scenario right and if you think
about risk what a lot of risk is
worrying about the worst case scenario
so for example if I say let's flip a
coin for $1,000 do if you can manage
dealing $1 th000 doesn't feel a lot of
money to you you're like yeah let's flip
a coin no problem if I say let's flip a
coin for everything you on now you're
like well who if I lose the worst

[1:56:30]
like well who if I lose the worst
casario is pretty bad I I I can't deal
with that so not being able to deal with
the worst Cas scenario is a big part of
risk so what you were doing with those
Reflections and those audios were going
today I could lose 10 bons I could lose
100K in the next week that's could
happen this is the logistics nature of
this game I'm okay with that as soon as

[1:56:46]
this game I'm okay with that as soon as
the M can go well that could happen
that's a spectrum of probability in
reality that's that's okay I can deal
with that if it does happen I would not
like it but it can happen all right cool
that's good I'm prepared for that let's
go and you're building some armor
armoring up the stoic much of you're
familiar with stoic philosophy but

[1:57:00]
familiar with stoic philosophy but
they're very big on like using negative
visualization as a kind of preparation
tool to allow you to go into hard
situations and go things might not go
the way you want them to that's okay but
I'm ready to deal with it so I really
like anyone who's maybe struggling with
risk as well could try those tools of

[1:57:15]
risk as well could try those tools of
preparing for the worst case scenario
and being okay with it cuz once you're
okay with the worst case scenario
life's easy life's an easy game CU like
what can what can happen that's worse
than the worst case so yeah yeah and
even more uh uh when I have uh a really

[1:57:30]
even more uh uh when I have uh a really
really bad down swing and also lots of
uh bad things happen in my wife there
are just some periods in life and it's
okay but in you are in the moment of
that period you feel like this is just
so bad this is just so tough uh why it's

[1:57:46]
so bad this is just so tough uh why it's
always me and all of these thoughts and
um when I have this right now
um I built this um thought which helped
me a lot and um it maybe sounds crazy

[1:58:00]
me a lot and um it maybe sounds crazy
but I would like to share it and it's
like that uh let's say you die right now
and this
ends and there are no problems but uh
are you okay to choose that option or
you just want to stay here and deal with

[1:58:16]
you just want to stay here and deal with
that all of that bad stuff and the
answer is completely always to and I
feel so relaxed after that and uh let's
yeah it maybe sounds very beautiful but

[1:58:30]
yeah it maybe sounds very beautiful but
in that moment when you feel like you
are cursed and everything's so bad uh it
helps me a lot and uh yeah poer is such
a profession that you have lots of down
swings and it's normal and if also at

[1:58:45]
swings and it's normal and if also at
the same time there are another bad
things so you you just might get in that
period of bad everything a lot in your
poker career that that's what I'm saying
and uh this thing that you you can just
choose to die right now helps me a lot

[1:59:02]
choose to die right now helps me a lot
and I'm not talking that I want to die I
never want to die but uh this thing this
thought helps me a lot to rebuild that
uh I'm lucky to be here in that spot and

[1:59:15]
uh I'm lucky to be here in that spot and
I can deal with all of that stuff and
it's it's soon it's be it it it will be
gone for sure it's it always like that
and
uh
yeah yeah so what you're doing there is
changing perspective so you're comparing

[1:59:31]
changing perspective so you're comparing
what feels like a big problem of losing
a poker and you're comparing that to
death and the other sudden you're like
wait a second like it ain't too bad I
think often a lot of our problems in
life are we get too zoomed in to zoomed
in on the the the dayto day like you're
you're on a down swing and you feel like

[1:59:45]
you're on a down swing and you feel like
you you've got the worst problems of all
time and your life sucks and your why
you you you're the victim but if you
realize like what like big problems
going on the world or dying or things in
your family that are going badly and you
start to take a second to just zoom out
from your zoomed in lens and look at
things around you and go actually life's

[2:00:00]
things around you and go actually life's
not too bad and often you'll you'll as
you mentioned you'll start to uh realize
actually I enjoy poker I'm actually
quite lucky compared to even most jobs
on the World to be a poker player and to
sit at my desk be my own boss and pursue
my own goals even that so yeah I think
often when you do that perspective

[2:00:15]
often when you do that perspective
exercise you come back to gratitude and
be more grateful for your situation now
doesn't mean it magically goes away and
all of a sudden like yeah this is
amazing I love down swings but it does
give you a um an angle to not overreact
to things going against you which I
think is a really powerful too so yeah
I'm really liking how you're ref your

[2:00:31]
I'm really liking how you're ref your
stories but also give little lessons and
little tools that other players can try
as well because I do think life is a
game of trying to uh understand how to
deal with adversity better especially as
a poker player so you can as you
mentioned protect your win rate and show
up consistently to uh to get your goals

[2:00:45]
up consistently to uh to get your goals
so yeah really really good stuff that
we're learning here so

Adam help you achieve your poker goals
in
2024 Ry I want to pass over to you now
in terms of your preparation and making
sure that you protect your win rate and
it doesn't drop anything that's been up
become more important over the years for
you to make sure you can do

[2:01:32]
you to make sure you can do
that I mean we touched actually on a lot
of points that I completely agree with
uh I would say my I think I I wrote down
in big letters the bigger picture that's
I think what we've been talking about

[2:01:45]
I think what we've been talking about
here it's very easy in poker to really
zoom in like oh I want to improve my win
rate and people dive into a solver but
like we have to zoom out way more and
basically you're an athlete and you try
to manage your life so you can perform
at your best and you can gain win rate
in many different areas I really liked

[2:02:02]
in many different areas I really liked
uh What uh what Nikolai said about the
aligning his expectations like okay
you're going to start playing tomorrow
and you can lose 100K and that's sort of
okay coming to terms with the best case
scenario I think it also helps then

[2:02:15]
scenario I think it also helps then
let's say for example I would go into a
session I would be like okay it's
possible that will lose five Bion right
now so then when it actually happens you
don't freak out whereas if you like you
go in you expect to win and suddenly you
lose five Bion you're like what the [ __ ]
is going on and then you can kind of
flip out whereas if you're like yeah

[2:02:30]
flip out whereas if you're like yeah
well this was a likely scenario so you
don't freak out and you manag to
preserve your win rate for the rest of
that session right that's I think a a
team that we've been talking about a lot
like you build your win rate Maybe by
studying but you actually turn that win
rate into money by preserving that win

[2:02:45]
rate into money by preserving that win
rate by managing Yourself by trying to
show up in the best way and there's
various tricks that we can do that I
actually once heard the the tip I don't
know where you record the voice but I
once got the tip like you can create a
WhatsApp group you add for example
someone that you know and yourself and
then you have that person leave and then

[2:03:00]
then you have that person leave and then
you have a WhatsApp group chat just with
yourself so that really helps to to
record audios I think that's really good
yeah I think that I think that's a very
good very good thing I used also just to
write notes or ideas to myself it's it's
pretty interesting actually I I I wrote

[2:03:17]
pretty interesting actually I I I wrote
down one one experience that had when I
was playing live in Vegas uh last year
there was I think it was towards the end
of my trip I want some money and I was
like okay well I felt like locking up

[2:03:30]
like okay well I felt like locking up
the win but no I had two more days to
play so obviously you know it's a
feeling that I can get like ah well I'm
up now you know we can also just call
call it a call it a trip but I was like
no no I'm gonna play and I was playing
but I wasn't I wasn't feeling I wasn't
feeling I was feeling a bit anxious I

[2:03:45]
feeling I was feeling a bit anxious I
don't know really know what was going on
and then there was a spot I don't know I
felt like a little bit of fear of losing
back or something like that and there
were and then there was a spot where I
remember I had like suited will Ace I
open I open from the from the big blind

[2:04:00]
open I open from the from the big blind
the straddled three bats I four bat so
it was like 150 400 1,000 or something
and then uh I think the board came if
I'm not mistaken King High I see bad he
calls turn brought double flush draw and
I had like Ace low so I thought ah it's

[2:04:16]
I had like Ace low so I thought ah it's
a good good hand to to Triple barrel
with he has a lot of the flush dos he's
going to call f y yada unblock FS block
calls you know the deal so I so I felt I
felt like some some resistance because I
was in like a more risk of state but my

[2:04:31]
was in like a more risk of state but my
logic took over it's like this is like
not combo not not run out so okay let's
go so I I I make the double barrel River
bricks easy triple and he snap calls
River was a queen he SN calls with
queens and I lost I lost my I lost my

[2:04:47]
queens and I lost I lost my I lost my
stack um
and actually after that I felt like this
sort of ease it's like ah the thing that
I was quotequote afraid of or that I
didn't want to happen happened and I
feel fine so I just grabb money from a

[2:05:01]
feel fine so I just grabb money from a
back reload and I was feeling great so
it was exactly what Adam said like you
kind of like you're maybe afraid of
something happening and then it actually
happens and then you realize listen it
was actually okay so actually that BL

[2:05:15]
was actually okay so actually that BL
being called was actually something that
kind of Rel Le me from it yeah yeah
exactly it's very weird you have to you
have you have to lose your stack in
order to feel okay but that that was I
guess what I was I wasn't feeling well I
really didn't know what it was but it

[2:05:30]
really didn't know what it was but it
was kind of a bit like fear I guess and
then when it happened I actually felt
felt pretty okay so that was that was an
H that was just a random hand that
popped up when I heard you were talking
about about that you also uh we we
talked a little bit about down swings as

[2:05:45]
talked a little bit about down swings as
well I think Adam pointed out that there
were two things you either start playing
more which is actually very counter it's
normal but it's counter Inuit it's
counterintuitive to not play more
because you want your money back so you
think okay I'm GNA play to get my money
back but as you mentioned if you play at

[2:06:01]
back but as you mentioned if you play at
a lower win rate then playing more is
actually maybe not the best idea right
and then Adam I think also manage you
study and then I would want to add to
that guy because like you could feel on
certain in a down swing and studying can
bring that that certainty and I fell for

[2:06:17]
bring that that certainty and I fell for
the trap in the past that you would then
just ignore the feeling of
uncertainty whatsoever and you just try
to rationalize that away but I think
it's very important to just view the
uncertainty and be okay with it like oh
listen you know I've I've I've got

[2:06:31]
listen you know I've I've I've got
beaten up it's normal that I feel a bit
uncertain or a bit low confidence it's
complet Define and I will get myself
back up but not to use studying as a
tool just to get rid of the uncertainty
and not allow any uncertainty to be
present I think that's an evolvement in

[2:06:47]
present I think that's an evolvement in
my emotional small management uh system
that I would like to to share with the
audience as well you also men mentioned
when you come back after a break we
talked a lot about the breaks and why
it's so important I think there's a lot

[2:07:01]
it's so important I think there's a lot
of knowledge in your head that is just
floating around and it needs kind of
time to settle and I think a break helps
helps kind of settle and then when you
look at the same problem like a poker
hand you suddenly get new ideas because
you literally freed up your mind to

[2:07:16]
you literally freed up your mind to
actually come up with new ideas right
you you gave your mind some time to
place all the thoughts you had in your
head in the right boxes to clean it up a
bit and now you can play and you can see
things way more clearly what I actually
like to do when I when I come back from

[2:07:30]
like to do when I when I come back from
a break or haven't played in a long time
I actually like to jump in straight
ahead because often we're we want to
prepare a bit better to kind of get rid
of the kind of pre-session anxiety a bit
you know to make sure that we that that
that we show up well but I actually

[2:07:45]
that we show up well but I actually
would recommend to just start in
straight away and just see what comes
out and usually you actually be
surprised I think you also mentioned we
think that we forget more than what we
actually forget yeah but I I I remember
I had a session with Jared about this
and then he said yeah Renee you keep on

[2:08:00]
and then he said yeah Renee you keep on
talking about how bad your game is if
you wouldn't prepare but have you ever
played Without preparing I was like huh
good point no I did not so what I would
then do is if I would come back there
actually a great opportunity to just sit
down play and see what comes out you
will see what your C game looks like and

[2:08:16]
will see what your C game looks like and
again that aligning expectations here is
very important you're not going to play
your aame okay most likely you're going
to be a bit Rusty but hey just see what
comes out so again aligning expectations
there uh I think are going to be very
important so yeah you guys you guys just

[2:08:30]
important so yeah you guys you guys just
touched on so much great topics about
like managing your career from a bigger
picture and this actually something that
I personally enjoy and sort of Miss
because I don't play I'm not as serious
about poker and playing poker at the

[2:08:45]
about poker and playing poker at the
moment but when I was fully on just
every day poker player poker player
poker actually what I really miss about
that is the fact that you're an athlete
and you can try to manage yourself so
you have to do exercise and you every
time try to be in a big state of
performance that whole routine around it

[2:09:01]
performance that whole routine around it
that's something that I would say I miss
the most of yeah really really taking
poker serious and playing every day and
trying to get the best out of your out
of your career is that something that
you enjoy as well because people can
feel like I have to exercise or I have
to do this no but you have to it's it's

[2:09:16]
to do this no but you have to it's it's
actually a lot of fun to try to up
yeah sure it feels great yeah you you
actually summarized really really good
all of the things we mentioned I think
and

[2:09:30]
and
um yeah uh poker being is an athlete
this is so good explanation as for my at
my in my opinion because yeah building
your win rate and uh maintaining your

[2:09:46]
your win rate and uh maintaining your
win rate is
much more than just uh playing with GTO
Wizard and like selecting the best games
it's much more than that it's lots of

[2:10:00]
it's much more than that it's lots of
lots of small details behind that and I
would say like that you can for sure
achieve like three four BBS uh doing
just uh
good uh just just playing and just doing
some

[2:10:15]
some
studing um if we talk about some okay
limits like 1K at least uh 500 1K but if
you want to go for 7 plus you have to do
lots of other stuff just not just

[2:10:31]
lots of other stuff just not just
practicing and studying poker lots of
other stuff behind behind like top
result win
rates yeah so and um going for that top
result win rate is a pretty good

[2:10:47]
result win rate is a pretty good
Adventure yeah yeah because um yeah it's
an enjoyable process I would say or at
least the way I'm wired I guess I guess
I enjoy it no I I would say the same and
all of this reflection which I do when I

[2:11:01]
all of this reflection which I do when I
make these audio voices uh
uh it feels so happy actually and um
when I just talk to myself um it feels
so it builds lots of confidence and it's

[2:11:17]
so it builds lots of confidence and it's
just
uh you feel life different when uh you
go through all of that stuff when you
like there is something you you afraid
of and you just go deep in that and um

[2:11:32]
of and you just go deep in that and um
yeah it's interesting and it's
enjoyable when uh you do uh that
regularly because when you just became
like

[2:11:45]
like
feeless and it helps a lot not only in
poker but in the whole life so now uh
for some reason I feel uh much more
confident in my life I I always was like
afraid that porker would end in two

[2:12:01]
afraid that porker would end in two
years and there's all actually a meme in
poker community that uh poker is ends in
two years and we we have to uh earn some
money really fast because yeah uh it's

[2:12:16]
money really fast because yeah uh it's
going to get closed in years yes and I
was really afraid of that and that's
basically the main reason why I didn't
have any breaks but now I feel much more
different because poker taught me a lot

[2:12:32]
different because poker taught me a lot
and I'm grateful for that it's not only
playing poker and earning money it's
also
like
um I I had to reflect a lot to achieve

[2:12:47]
um I I had to reflect a lot to achieve
uh my goal in poker and it helped me to
build U understanding and confidence in
like whole life and now I'm not scared
that I would go broke if I go broke I

[2:13:01]
that I would go broke if I go broke I
think I'll manage actually and uh even
though now my family is used to spend
lots of money we are we are having
pretty good uh level of life and uh I

[2:13:16]
pretty good uh level of life and uh I
need lots of money to to feel okay uh
but I don't feel like it's crazy bad and
I feel like uh I would just take

[2:13:30]
I feel like uh I would just take
it um
like as professional as um I uh try to
take all of my down swings in pocker
like the SC I think also the SC the
scarcity around it is gone and you've

[2:13:45]
scarcity around it is gone and you've
build it enough confidence in yourself
to be able to figure it out even if
worst case scenar worst case scenario
happens you've built so much more skills
than just playing poker that you'll find
a
way I I had to build those skills that

[2:14:01]
way I I had to build those skills that
that's a good thing about poker so just
like I said you can go 3bb and it's much
easier but if you want to go for like
seven and I always wanted to be a top
regular on my state it was like uh the

[2:14:16]
regular on my state it was like uh the
thing that um helped me a lot uh because
um I never wanted to go high stakes just
like I said only three last three years
I I changed my priorities but back then

[2:14:31]
I I changed my priorities but back then
um the main goal of myself was like be
the host of my limit you know like I
would just sit the table and like I can
play everybody I don't care you you
can't play and actually the funny thing

[2:14:47]
can't play and actually the funny thing
about that is that um when you are
hosting your limit um you are not scared
of anyone let's say uh before my high
stes uh Journey uh I was like playing

[2:15:02]
stes uh Journey uh I was like playing
one 2K and um yeah I um I played a lot
of volume already there I had lots of
down swings up swings I had lots of
experience there and I'm not afraid to
play anyone at those Stakes let's say

[2:15:18]
play anyone at those Stakes let's say
uh I'm running I'm like on the 2K table
and like L pops up and Stefan and then
one they want to play free marks with me
I'm okay that it's that's a great
experience that poker is not about money

[2:15:31]
experience that poker is not about money
only and I know that uh I might be
losing to that but actually it's not
that easy because right now they can be
in not their best shape they they can
have some games at the site they they

[2:15:46]
have some games at the site they they
can like let's say uh lenus can be just
practicing heads up too much recently
and he's not that good and free marks
and lots of lots of stuff and for
example he might just be finishing the
session he had like 20 uh year TW hour

[2:16:03]
session he had like 20 uh year TW hour
session at high stakes and he just
tiled so it's not that easy like lenus
is better player than me and he would
destroy me so I'm not scared to play if
this is my limit uh and if uh this game

[2:16:17]
this is my limit uh and if uh this game
would start I would play it and I would
enjoy it and I would enjoy even losing
it because uh poker is so much more than
just going there for money it's um a lot

[2:16:30]
just going there for money it's um a lot
of other stuff and I enjoy it a lot and
that's why I love
poker and um yeah
so it's also it's also interesting like
when when you take a shot at like two of
these guys for example let's say for

[2:16:46]
these guys for example let's say for
example you're a bit lower in the Rank
and like I said they could have already
been playing or they have other tables
that have their priorities and they kind
of put like their B or C game and you
actually show up to this game it's like
wow this is like it's like the most
exciting game you know so actually

[2:17:00]
exciting game you know so actually
you'll be playing more of your aame so I
think this actually will level out I
remember actually when I would battle a
lot I had one criteria which I thought
was really good I would only battle if I
would be the one starting the battle so
the way it used to work I don't know how

[2:17:16]
the way it used to work I don't know how
I think in G is the same right two
people sit but used it used to be like
that the Stars two people sit then one
can join and then usually the
three-handed game start what I would
then do is let's say for example I was
sitting most of the time if someone
would join I would leave the
table okay I would take 10 minute like

[2:17:32]
table okay I would take 10 minute like
10 minutes or so like okay who joined
the player what kind of player is he
what's my game plan and then I would
join on my terms yeah does that make
sense so like I would always have that I
will be the one starting the game so I
would have the edge to pick the seat I

[2:17:46]
would have the edge to pick the seat I
would be the one to decide now it's the
time I would I would take that 10
minutes just to go over my notes like
okay who's this guy ah yeah is this guy
okay this is guy this proxim me so I
would always join the join the game on
my terms and I think that gives you a

[2:18:00]
my terms and I think that gives you a
huge Adge just like as you said because
I I came in more prepared than the other
person it's a really good good attitude
in R battles I think um yeah this 10
minutes can help but by the way this
doesn't work if everyone does it right

[2:18:15]
doesn't work if everyone does it right
because then everyone keeps on leaving
it like okay guys let's just agree to
all come back 15 minutes later
okay yeah but actually like there is
some mind games between that as well
because like um when when you just leave

[2:18:32]
because like um when when you just leave
the table it feels like you feel that
he's stronger but then if you are back
then it feels like you just left because
of some other reasons and yeah I'm ready
to battle let's go and uh for him for

[2:18:46]
to battle let's go and uh for him for
your opponent it it might look
um much more um difficult than if he
just set sat in in the you you try you
yeah so when when he joined he was like

[2:19:00]
yeah so when when he joined he was like
okay I want to battle and then when you
when you leave him to calm down a little
bit like 10 minutes 15 minutes and then
you come in with that attitude you have
an immediate
adment so uh a little trick here and now
everyone in the high six m is going to
sit out sit in sit out sit in so we

[2:19:15]
sit out sit in sit out sit in so we
talked actually a lot about maintaining
women rate but let's talk a little bit
about building wiim rate I remember you
you just recalled again that for the
last three years you know you've been
building your game so you can beat the
high stakes before that you were mainly
playing mid Stakes you talked the main

[2:19:30]
playing mid Stakes you talked the main
thing that that changed right you
eliminated distractions of your crypto
your other Investments your business and
you went to live poker how does that
look like for Nikolai Nikolai is living
poker what's like a day in a day in the
life of Nikolai you know trying to

[2:19:45]
life of Nikolai you know trying to
trying to reach those highest Stakes
living poker I have pretty
um uh stable routine right stable is is
that a world or yeah yeah yeah okay
stable routine so now I'm living in

[2:20:03]
stable routine so now I'm living in
puket and um uh I wake up at 7 A.M and
um uh yeah I I try different I I try to
play night I try to play uh day uh and

[2:20:19]
play night I try to play uh day uh and
uh every time um I realize that uh for
me personally it's better to uh start
playing in the morning uh and I I think

[2:20:30]
playing in the morning uh and I I think
it's also um important thing that you
have to choose for yourself exactly
because people are really different in
lots of ways and you have to to know uh
your your best uh to choose choose your

[2:20:47]
your your best uh to choose choose your
best yeah so for me it's the morning so
even uh when I was in Russia my morning
games were pretty bad but um all of my
life um is much better when I play

[2:21:03]
life um is much better when I play
morning the morning so uh right now in
is cool to play the morning because it's
like nighttime in uh uh USA and uh uh so

[2:21:17]
like nighttime in uh uh USA and uh uh so
the games are pretty good especially at
wpn um and Chico I played lots of Chico
back then when I played 1K a
lot so um 7 a.m. um then I do my warm up

[2:21:34]
lot so um 7 a.m. um then I do my warm up
I always do the warm up I had lots of
sessions with girl who is like um with
back I don't know uh I don't know their

[2:21:45]
back I don't know uh I don't know their
word how to explain what she does is
just basically um building the best warm
up for your profession something like
that yes she just uh was uh she uh she
came back from gymnastics she did um

[2:22:03]
came back from gymnastics she did um
medical graduation and uh she knows all
of the muscles stuff behind it so uh I
have pretty good warm up for uh for my

[2:22:16]
have pretty good warm up for uh for my
profession so I would just sit and I
have like the table which can go up and
down which is a common thing in poker so
I warm up and uh I started playing poker
I I don't do like one hour study before

[2:22:30]
I I don't do like one hour study before
that all of that no I just warm up my uh
physical uh to to get like the blood uh
yeah because you're talking about
straight after you wake up you go to
your office you you get yourself a bit
moving physically with this 10- minute

[2:22:45]
moving physically with this 10- minute
exercise that that you mentioned and
then you go straight into playing
there's no yeah absolutely yeah every
time like that and usually my breakfast
uh my wife would uh get it right here
for me and uh yeah I would play um just

[2:23:02]
for me and uh yeah I would play um just
like you mentioned you said that you
think that after resting it's better to
just go play I think that after waking
up uh it's better to just go play uh
right after and not do too much

[2:23:15]
right after and not do too much
preparations you just have to
take your games responsible enough so I
wouldn't like just open all the tables
and uh wre War all of them straight away
um I would just uh open all of the

[2:23:31]
um I would just uh open all of the
tables I I see uh what games are um and
I would start like pretty slow pretty
slow and let's say in 30 minutes I'm
prepared enough and I can play like

[2:23:45]
prepared enough and I can play like
everything pretty much so uh I play for
I play one session for six to eight
hours uh I think so it's it's five days
a week not that much actually but um

[2:24:01]
a week not that much actually but um
that's my routine right now then I have
one day which is like um studying day I
don't do that much study I think
actually studying too much is also a
mistake um because poker is more of or

[2:24:17]
mistake um because poker is more of or
about practicing and it's actually more
about just being able to catch that game
which gives you lots of EV I mean a lot
of time I feel that mistake that a

[2:24:31]
of time I feel that mistake that a
player uh want to play a game only and
he would just uh leave after after a
mistake to to go to Wizard and study
that mistake and then when he studies

[2:24:45]
that mistake and then when he studies
there is a uh VIP player who just you
know
uh just all it's all the money yeah yeah
yeah so a big part of successful po
career is being there when the VIP shows

[2:25:00]
career is being there when the VIP shows
up right for sure yeah so you have just
spent hours in the lobby that that's uh
that's a very important thing I think so
uh I don't advise uh I wouldn't have
advised to study too much please play a

[2:25:15]
advised to study too much please play a
lot and especially
if you have a good enough win rate um
actually I uh did lots of coaching back
then in my career as well when I was
pretty uh good Crusher at
51k and I was like investing all of that

[2:25:32]
51k and I was like investing all of that
stuff I don't want to go for high stakes
so uh to uh earn some more money I also
did coaching and U I always uh say that
one you should move up move up in stakes

[2:25:46]
one you should move up move up in stakes
and be please if your win rate is good
enough just play a lot when uh you have
to go
study poker will tell you uh don't worry
poker will tell you when you have to go
study if you have if let's say you are

[2:26:02]
study if you have if let's say you are
just
U no NL 100 grinder and you have 5bb you
are very good mate you just go practice
don't care about studying you don't need
to study you just go play when you want

[2:26:16]
to study you just go play when you want
to go short taken 200 you would probably
get crushed because that's how poker
works and uh then you can go study but
now just please play and build the
bankroll because that's how poker works

[2:26:31]
bankroll because that's how poker works
the main EV we get is just from VIP
players it's not about uh finding some
secret special uh moment in GTO Wizard
or like canot and all that stuff it's
not about that it's just being there

[2:26:47]
not about that it's just being there
when the VIP player comes and when he
just throws away all of the table all
the money on the table and um yeah there
are lots of uh really good VIP players

[2:27:02]
are lots of uh really good VIP players
uh at online poker and if you just spent
a lot hours in the lobes and if you
would um wreck battles so uh I think
Rick Buton is a very important thing in

[2:27:15]
Rick Buton is a very important thing in
poker career if you want to go uh for
top results because one you would um be
prepared to play against the toughest
opponents where they would um they would
always put you in a tough spot so you

[2:27:32]
always put you in a tough spot so you
would uh have motivation to study and
you would um you would see uh where your
leaks are where your problems are and
second which is probably even more

[2:27:45]
second which is probably even more
important you would always be the on the
table when the IP comes and this is very
important because even let's say you are
really bad person and you have like the
best script ever sitting script I mean

[2:28:02]
best script ever sitting script I mean
uh right now they are forbidden on all
of the sites from as far as I know but
there are some people which still using
it and let's say your script is like
very very very fast but for sure it's

[2:28:16]
very very very fast but for sure it's
want uh sit you on the 100% tables it's
just impossible because there are tables
there are five guys Bing and when VIP
comes at that table you won't get the
seat and probably this VIP would lose

[2:28:32]
seat and probably this VIP would lose
like 15 bins on that table and you know
what that's how in rate is built in
poker
so um back to my routine I don't do too
much studying but uh five days I only

[2:28:46]
much studying but uh five days I only
play one day is for the studing if I
feel like studying I would study all of
that day but when you say when when you
say study do you mean like evaluate your
week and evaluate how how how the week
went in terms of you're studying those

[2:29:00]
went in terms of you're studying those
hand or are you studying like no no I
don't do that I don't do that and uh I
also would recommend to build your
strategy that's the main thing you
should study on is just like be prepared
to play every spot possible and uh for

[2:29:16]
to play every spot possible and uh for
these three yes I did all of that and
now I can say that I pretty much know uh
how can I play every possible six Max
spot not not perfect for sure but the

[2:29:30]
spot not not perfect for sure but the
main idea behind that how and why uh I
know the answers and that's um that's my
hours which I put in uh that's just uh
building that uh knowing about all of

[2:29:46]
building that uh knowing about all of
the spots
so that's was those were like the hours
you put it in preparing sort of to make
the jump towards high stakes I think I
think you mentioned to me before that
you know you spended like 10 to 20 hours
on every spot just to prepare like kind

[2:30:01]
on every spot just to prepare like kind
of your default strategy in all spots so
you kind of from there know what to do
and from there you know I have a good
default strategy and from there I'll
take a new information that's presented
to me at the table and I'll start to
adjust uh yeah based on that information
is is that about right default yeah

[2:30:17]
is is that about right default yeah
absolutely right and this default
strategy is not about just learning
their G2 it's about also learning the
best play against the population
Tendencies this is this is my default
strategy so uh I I should not only like

[2:30:32]
strategy so uh I I should not only like
play with trainer but also study the
population Tendencies yeah so so so for
example to get an idea of you you sat
down you said okay I'm going to reach
high stakes I'm G to have to study every
spot build my Baseline strategy which is

[2:30:47]
spot build my Baseline strategy which is
probably the first thing you probably
look at is solver right GTO frequencies
how does it play kind of in the laws
within within GTO then you mentioned
like data are we talking like H to note
MDA type of statistic compared that to

[2:31:02]
MDA type of statistic compared that to
GTO to see where they deviate and come
up with more optimal exploitative
strategies is that kind of what we're
talking about yeah yeah yeah sure and
also observing lots of games I I always
observe like all direct battles possible

[2:31:15]
observe like all direct battles possible
I always observe all of the like really
big interesting games so if I feel like
this game is interesting I would always
watch it or or probably I also did lots
of uh back then I did lots of like just
um um starting to um screen capture the

[2:31:35]
um um starting to um screen capture the
screen so I can watch after yeah I've
done this as well I've done this as well
quite a lot in the past yeah and and I
think um this is also helps a lot so it

[2:31:45]
think um this is also helps a lot so it
builds like um this understanding on
people Tendencies without uh really like
studying it in hand toote and all that
stuff because uh studing poer is
actually really boring and difficult

[2:32:01]
actually really boring and difficult
from from my point of view this is very
boring so I try to uh switch between uh
between uh like my starting
options uh so if I feel like uh I don't
want to go Sol right now I can just

[2:32:16]
want to go Sol right now I can just
watch game I can just uh you know also I
did lots of U uh just uh
database St studies uh uh on hand to
note I also uh watch lots of games on

[2:32:31]
note I also uh watch lots of games on
YouTube R battles and just tons of Poker
um videos and um and histories and also
two plus two fret I don't even have an
account on two plus two but this fret

[2:32:45]
account on two plus two but this fret
which is like K stakes poker yeah so I
read that a lot as well and yeah I think
um if you talk about starting starting
poker the the main struggle here is to

[2:33:00]
poker the the main struggle here is to
do it consistently and
consistency is the key I think and um so
I try to build my consistency right here
um and there are lots of lots of pieces

[2:33:15]
um and there are lots of lots of pieces
which helps me to to be consistent in
that for example I found um I had good
advice to study poker not at the same uh
room which you play in so you can just
take your laptop with your solar and go

[2:33:31]
take your laptop with your solar and go
like to the cafeteria have some coffee
and or tea or you can go to the park you
you can go like everywhere because it's
pretty easy especially with GTO wizard
um to study poker or you can just not do

[2:33:47]
um to study poker or you can just not do
it with solver you can watch YouTube
video you can do lots of stuff but when
you do it in the same room it can get
boring really easy and if you uh

[2:34:00]
boring really easy and if you uh
switch sometimes if you uh switch uh the
way you study if you switch the place
you study if you uh switch the person
you study with if you do that it's it
becames not that boring I also talked

[2:34:15]
becames not that boring I also talked
Lots of poker with different people and
it also helped so it's it's kind of a
mind hack actually that that that that
that you're explaining here in terms of
switching rooms I've heard about this
before and I think this is very valuable

[2:34:30]
before and I think this is very valuable
to the to start at the base layer you
should have a different room where you
play than where you relax because if you
for example put your office in your
bedroom your brain actually get quite
confused like wait I'm in my bedroom am
I here to relax and sleep or am I here
to [ __ ] perform and I'm serious like

[2:34:47]
to [ __ ] perform and I'm serious like
the brain gets really confused that's
why for the vast majority of my career I
had a separate office which was not even
in my home so I actually had to go to
the office and going to the office the
act of itself and then stepping into
your office your brain is like office

[2:35:01]
your office your brain is like office
perform and it's it does Miracles you
know and I remember I would drive my
bike because we're in the Netherlands
you know and I would always listen to uh
back then I think it was Conor McGregor
who was very popular and I would listen
to all these Conor McGregor motivational
videos on my YouTube driving towards my

[2:35:16]
videos on my YouTube driving towards my
office getting all fired up to start the
play and then you arrive in the office
like office perform and then when you
come home you know you manage to relax
better because your home and your home
is too relaxed and I know you have you
have a family as well it allows you to
also be to let go of Poker and to be

[2:35:31]
also be to let go of Poker and to be
more present with your family so I think
separating rooms and then uh exactly
what you explained I did exactly the
same I would grab my laptop go to the
cafeteria that's where I would do my
analyzing how I play that's where I
would do my my study work so I I I
strongly I think I think you're giving I

[2:35:46]
strongly I think I think you're giving I
mean that's a it's a bit it's a bit
narcisstic I was say I think you're give
a good advice because I agree but you
you you get what I mean uh um we also a
lot about sorry sure I think that
probably uh this thing that you have uh

[2:36:02]
probably uh this thing that you have uh
uh motivation videos Conor McGregor and
you driving on a bike to the office this
probably would give you like uh half BB
win rate for sure for sure yeah yeah for

[2:36:15]
win rate for sure for sure yeah yeah for
sure it's like it's like the bigger
picture you know yeah yeah in in bigger
picture it's crazy how it works because
uh poker especially poker at the top
level is just
so uh lots of small details like really

[2:36:33]
so uh lots of small details like really
small details but lots of them even like
remembering specific hand which you
played like against some uh opponent
would can can help you a lot against
same opponent in uh this hand and so all

[2:36:47]
same opponent in uh this hand and so all
of that small pieces and if if you study
like your database your hands and you
remember this hand it can help you in
one specific hand like a lot and all of
that small pieces build your win rate so

[2:37:00]
that small pieces build your win rate so
I think also Showdown Showdown related
studying like you mentioned see like uh
seeing seeing hands being played by
other players like you can obviously
study the numbers and see like okay this
note is overfolded or under bluffed and
compared it to the GTO frequency that's
one way it stimulates your brain in

[2:37:15]
one way it stimulates your brain in
certain way you get more yeah cognitive
knowledge but seeing showdowns and
seeing people actually play the hand and
seeing the hand turn out that kind of
trains more I would say your intuition
and it kind of one Showdown can indeed
like be grained in your head like oh W

[2:37:30]
like be grained in your head like oh W
this showdown really is grained in my
head especially if it's like outside of
the norm and that can really help you
make a better decision uh yeah later in
a hand that you play against that
opponent that's such a beautiful um
thing in Walker the when when you

[2:37:46]
thing in Walker the when when you
explain all that I I see the beauty of
this game and for me it's it's like
crazy cool be before before I want to
ask a question that I know a lot of
players are struggling with I want to
add one more thing about the the

[2:38:01]
add one more thing about the the
managing of your session that I I wrote
down this note but I didn't get to it
and you managed as well right you play
for eight hours and it's not like in in
the beginning you just jump into a game
like oh you know you wake
up oh lius is sitting lius step 300 oh

[2:38:16]
up oh lius is sitting lius step 300 oh
let me sit down let's go you know that's
not really the way it works like also
especially if you sit down and let's say
you know you're going to play 10 hours
today okay energy management for example
yeah is also very important like people
people jump into a game short pictured

[2:38:32]
people jump into a game short pictured
with the only question they have is am I
plus CV in this game that's the criteria
that they need to join the game and say
yes okay so you sit down and play I'm I
Plus in this game is all yes yes yes yes
and then before you know it you plan to
play 10 hours of good volume well if

[2:38:46]
play 10 hours of good volume well if
you're going to play 10 hours you
probably should not join every day but
that's presented to you that's plus
right we should think no I'm going to
play 10 hours so is this table worth it
or should I now waste a lot of my energy
wck battling or I'm already eight hours
into my session should I still join lus

[2:39:01]
into my session should I still join lus
and stepan
three-handed probably not a great idea
so maybe I should I should w Battle a
bit more in the beginning wreck Battle
less at the end of my session and be a
bit more selective with the games also
like you could even take this to another

[2:39:15]
like you could even take this to another
level like what I would then sometimes
do is I'm going towards the end of my
session that I've played for six seven
eight
hours and there's like a lot of marginal
hands that I could play like in solver
0.01% I would just be like listen I'm
here because this [ __ ] will is still

[2:39:31]
here because this [ __ ] will is still
here you know that's the only reason I'm
still saying I'm not going to open like
this bottom hand right now and get into
all types of spots because I don't have
the brain power for it I'm already six
hours into my session I'm not able to
make great decisions so maybe pass up on
like these very marginal

[2:39:46]
like these very marginal
marginal pre flop Ops in certain spots
or marginal three bets against opponents
that you know maybe just got fresh into
their session these all things to take
in consideration right we're not robots
that's I think also something that that
you mentioned right we're not we're not
the

[2:40:01]
the
machines yeah when you uh explain all of
that I just like I said I see the beauty
of this game because it's lot of these
small pieces and this energy management
like you mentioned that's a really

[2:40:15]
like you mentioned that's a really
really big part of your win rate as well
and this um difference between 3bb
player and like ABB player uh a lot on
all of that uh things like like you
mentioned uh energy management and like
R botland also um in the end of the

[2:40:33]
R botland also um in the end of the
session for example I think you you
shouldn't really w Battle I always uh
stop all of my w battles in the end of
the session especially if I have good
enough games and actually when the games
are really good and I have um time to uh

[2:40:48]
are really good and I have um time to uh
to extend my session I would just uh I
would just uh close all of the tables
which are like uh small plus CV I would
just play like three tables with huge

[2:41:01]
just play like three tables with huge
last plus plus TV but I would focus a
lot more on that and if I feel tired
enough I can even like uh you know
listen to the music or watch some
YouTube on the site and it feels

[2:41:16]
YouTube on the site and it feels
it's not like professional enough but
still it's a lot of plus EV and it's
much better if I just play like eight
tables with some R Buton on the side and
stuff like that because I would just
miss a lot of um important hands and

[2:41:32]
miss a lot of um important hands and
this way I can just okay this hand I
would play so I just stop my YouTube and
I would just focus on that hand I would
just you know see all of the showdowns
previously I would just open my replayer
and I'm Focus I I have enough money and

[2:41:48]
and I'm Focus I I have enough money and
enough time sorry and enough um energy
to focus and enough like um stamina I I
can say because yeah like uh when you
see uh when you start the session let's

[2:42:01]
see uh when you start the session let's
say you have like 100 points of uh
focusing energy and all of that and
towards the end of the session you you
have like seven left let's say and you
can just spend all the seven to some uh

[2:42:17]
can just spend all the seven to some uh
unimportant stuff like you mentioned
like opening hands uh for betting like
marginal cans like def defending like
for B against really tough player uh
with uh let's say uh A5 suited so you

[2:42:34]
with uh let's say uh A5 suited so you
you don't have to do that you can just
keep that spot and it would be fine but
uh if you try to uh play this spot
especially against really tough opponent

[2:42:45]
especially against really tough opponent
the thing is the toughest opponent is
the more energy you can spend to play
against him especially if you are like a
battler in your heart and yeah and if if
if you would play all these spots and

[2:43:01]
if you would play all these spots and
that would mean you have to quit 30
minutes earlier for example it's better
to not play these spots and play 30 more
minutes with the will at the table yeah
yeah
and like uh if we talk not about 10 hour
session um and like four hour session

[2:43:17]
session um and like four hour session
you can just get tired too much playing
too much and you would just quit because
you are tired already but at like 20 in
between 20 minutes you left the huge VIP

[2:43:32]
between 20 minutes you left the huge VIP
player might come so just like I
mentioned it so it's really important to
uh spend your hours in the lobbies and
to manage all of your energy and all of
the time uh correctly and it's also a

[2:43:48]
the time uh correctly and it's also a
very big part of Poker professional so
poker
professional too much players just sit
down I'm going to play three hours they
just fire up all the tables and they
might game select a bit more but they
don't take in consideration like okay

[2:44:01]
don't take in consideration like okay
I'm firing up like now these type of
Break Even tables I'm playing here with
like a semi VIP you know like is it
really worth your time or should you
maybe just close that table or if you
have no tables hey man just just breathe
a little bit for five minutes I don't
know stretch until you have a better

[2:44:16]
know stretch until you have a better
table that's actually something that you
were hating on the Bang Bang on the
seaing scripts here but remember in the
past when seing scripts were still
allowed I really love that man because I
you could just you could do some
stretching and you you wouldn't miss a
game because you suddenly heard and that

[2:44:30]
game because you suddenly heard and that
means it set you on the table that was
amazing man you could you could really
take you could take like a small break
close your eyes and you wouldn't miss a
game that was that was amazing times I I
wanted to touch uh on one topic that
I've noticed a lot of players struggle
with when and you mentioned that you

[2:44:46]
with when and you mentioned that you
spend like 10 20 hours going over every
spot to kind of prepare for the higher
thi game so you had a good default game
plan in every situation what's the level
of detail you go

[2:45:00]
into yeah um it depends on the spot the
the more frequent spot is the the deeper
I would go so let's say like uh
squeezing against MP uh it's not not uh

[2:45:16]
squeezing against MP uh it's not not uh
really important to study that much you
just basically want to know which sizes
are are used and uh how frequent are you
boring stuff like that which hands you
pick up how uh important blockers are on

[2:45:31]
pick up how uh important blockers are on
the river do you have to block something
or can you just uh go with the bottom of
your range stuff like that and and
you're done and you you shouldn't really
go back to that like in three years I
think

[2:45:46]
think
um and if we talk about like Baron
versus BB spot you can you should spend
a lot of time there and actually I think
like building if we talk only about

[2:46:01]
like building if we talk only about
strategic um point if we talk only about
strategic part of um your win rate uh
lots of your win rate comes from how you
play as
aggressor uh it's very important to play

[2:46:15]
aggressor uh it's very important to play
as caller uh really good at big blind
but as caller you you have to suck a lot
it's just the way how poker works so uh
it's you just uh have to be kind of

[2:46:30]
it's you just uh have to be kind of
aggressive and use like some sizes some
donks and but as aggressor there are a
lot of um a lot of Opp opportunities and
a lot of um space

[2:46:45]
a lot of um space
uh
to to a lot of space to be creative and
lots of stuff you can do I mean like
only let's say like you can uh just um
build your strategy that uh if it went

[2:47:02]
build your strategy that uh if it went
check check on the Flop you you can just
uh start to implement free EX or over B
delay on the Jour and against like
population in lots of spot spots it can
be really good strategy but it would

[2:47:17]
be really good strategy but it would
just be
um I mean like there are lots of space
to build an edge in those spots because
it's always like if your opponent is not

[2:47:32]
it's always like if your opponent is not
um defended enough in that particular
situation in that range you can just be
crazy and that what solver teach teaches
us uh that you you can and not be crazy

[2:47:46]
us uh that you you can and not be crazy
just like bluffing all the [ __ ] it's
also about just going like really thin
and really uh expensive and you have to
study a lot to to understand um how um

[2:48:01]
study a lot to to understand um how um
because small uh parts of opponent uh
your opponent's range can uh def for
your strategy a lot so let's say just in
um this is a spot uh your GTO bot would

[2:48:16]
um this is a spot uh your GTO bot would
check ra like 20% and people tend to
check ra 5% then if you log the strategy
this is just crazy what solar does in
those spots
so yeah um from strategic point of view

[2:48:32]
so yeah um from strategic point of view
um put in lots of hours as aggressor uh
in those just uh SRP spots these are
really important and also threee bad
spots as well like just ch crazing all

[2:48:45]
spots as well like just ch crazing all
of the free B spots is also very very
important thing you you have to put lots
of hours in that because uh lots of
people are just tend to uh 100% cat like
every possible board and this is still a
thing actually and and lots of boards uh

[2:49:03]
thing actually and and lots of boards uh
your um reaction supposed to be like
cing like 40 and this is so crazy and
you have to be prepared for that you
have to uh like working in solver is

[2:49:18]
have to uh like working in solver is
just like getting prepared for all of
the um ways which your opponent can go
and uh if you're prepared enough to
exploit all of the Tendencies you just
have to um to understand the tendences

[2:49:34]
have to um to understand the tendences
on uh your opponent on even on your
population you're playing against and uh
just use all of these preparations you
did uh back with Sol so yeah you learn I

[2:49:47]
did uh back with Sol so yeah you learn I
think a very important thing I I agree
with you I think aggressor spots is
these are spots where you kind of direct
the action right like you managed you
talked about creativity you can steer
the hand into many directions where the
defender he's usually kind of having to

[2:50:02]
defender he's usually kind of having to
respond to the strategy that the
aggressor chooses and what I like about
and what I think is effective as well
when you choose to focus more on
aggressor spots when you when you focus
on aggressor spots you kind of learn
what's correct and then by learning

[2:50:15]
what's correct and then by learning
what's correct you also understand okay
people probably going to screw up so as
a Defender if you understand how hard it
is to play a spot correctly you will be
able to defend yourself and exploit that
note in a better way so that's why
therefore I also think aggressive spots
are are very

[2:50:31]
are are very
important and in terms of like level
level of detail for example I see
sometimes students they uh they go over
different textures are you more of like
no I use one side let's just simplify
one/ third on all boards or do you add a
lot of new ones to textur or how would

[2:50:46]
lot of new ones to textur or how would
you recommend or how would you recommend
studying this that's actually the very
good question because um when I first
had my coaches with uh good um players
they always tend to say like you should

[2:51:02]
they always tend to say like you should
simplify your strategy as as much as you
can you should just go one size every
street you shouldn't do any dunks and
stuff like that and those are people who
beat in like 1K 2K uh or even high

[2:51:15]
beat in like 1K 2K uh or even high
stakes so it's not like NL 50 guys right
uh and I tend to simplify because of
them a lot but then uh when I reached 1K
2K and I was just playing it

[2:51:31]
2K and I was just playing it
consistently not going for the high
stakes because they are dead just like I
mentioned I find myself that uh it's
very boring for me to play poker and
even when I wre battle like tough
opponents it's really boring because I'm
just basically know what I would do and

[2:51:47]
just basically know what I would do and
this is just so easy and this is just so
it becomes not more of a pocker but just
like printing the money bum BLM BM so
boring and that's it's not an advice but

[2:52:02]
boring and that's it's not an advice but
if
you um if you have good win rate but you
feel like you're already bought please
go uh for the for the more complicated
strategy you you can you can start uh

[2:52:17]
strategy you you can you can start uh
throwing some donkey donkey yeah donkey
donkey Everyone likes a donkey donkey
yeah donkey donkey I I love those in
your videos uh all of these donkey
donkeys this is great so you can just
start complicating your strategy not

[2:52:31]
start complicating your strategy not
only because there is like huge Edge
between that yeah like everybody said
there is no much Edge if you go one size
or two size but actually it's not
completely true because it's not big
Edge against solver but against your

[2:52:45]
Edge against solver but against your
opponent it might be like a huge Edge
actually so it's not that easy as well
uh here is the beauty of Poker but only
for not to get too Bor in your poker
routine is it's already worth it I think

[2:53:03]
routine is it's already worth it I think
so now I I tend to uh study some like
rare spots
to and add some sizings like over Bing
flops like doning turns like um just

[2:53:17]
flops like doning turns like um just
straight uh jamming with the flops or in
for bed parts just using like uh two
Street game in fre bed parts all of that
stuff I just study and it's not because
I think uh this would gain me an edge

[2:53:32]
I think uh this would gain me an edge
it's just because I would like to see uh
the beauty of the game uh to extend my
knowledge uh to to be prepared for
different spots and if I feel like oh

[2:53:45]
different spots and if I feel like oh
this is very good I would Implement that
in my strategy but I don't have to I can
just study it to get the bigger picture
and it helps a lot uh and uh I see that
um doing that helps actually in

[2:54:01]
um doing that helps actually in
different ways um I find myself a lot in
spots I don't study that I took them
more creative you know like yeah
understand you understand like cause

[2:54:15]
understand you understand like cause
effect relationship when certain
variables line up in certain ways this
is usually going to be the consequence
so you're able to this is actually
something that the way I like to teach
as well you kind of zoom out more focus
on the impact certain variables have on
strategies kind of the mechanics behind

[2:54:30]
strategies kind of the mechanics behind
the game and that allows you to problem
solve better in game so that even if
you're in a situation that you've never
been in before well you kind of know
like what what Drive strategies right so
you're able to problem solve and be more
creative naturally not force you're not
trying to memor a complex strategy you

[2:54:45]
trying to memor a complex strategy you
know but it comes more intuitively
because you understand the drivers
behind
strategy yeah yeah sure and uh um at at
least it's more fun to play like that to
yeah you you think you think if you only

[2:55:00]
yeah you you think you think if you only
play simplified strategies all the time
you stop
thinking yeah that that's a point I'm
trying to say that simplifying
strategies is bad only because it's not
bad for your win rate it's actually
great for your win rate especially if
you want

[2:55:15]
you want
be just a pretty good pretty good rack
but not the top rack but it's very
dangerous because you can just stop
thinking and if you do all of these
complicated stuff you you can just uh
switch to the thinking mod in all of the

[2:55:32]
switch to the thinking mod in all of the
game all of the hands you play even in
those like which are so common when you
just uh snap bad 3 33% po because you
used to you can just like oh what what
if I go like half qut here uh how is he

[2:55:48]
if I go like half qut here uh how is he
supposed to react and uh Here Comes
Stefan as well again uh because what I
really like about Stefan is just he not
only feel this on the tables he is also

[2:56:01]
only feel this on the tables he is also
like really free to uh play every every
crazy idea he gets uh because like he we
had a spot on
5K maybe like two months ago which is

[2:56:15]
5K maybe like two months ago which is
pretty interesting I think I opened cut
off he
defended button blinds folded and B came
like 864 or something I checked and he
went for the 75% on that flop and all

[2:56:30]
went for the 75% on that flop and all
their uh solver guys would uh
screenshot uh this immediately and say
like you're supposed to go one uh 25%
20% 33% you you're supposed to go a lot
and very small but he just go 7 Stan he

[2:56:46]
and very small but he just go 7 Stan he
he can even overb this flap and what is
he trying to do is like hey I know how
to do that I know that I supposed to go
25 but I would like to go 75 and what
are you going to do with that do you

[2:57:01]
are you going to do with that do you
know what you should do how yeah how
you're gonna approach this spot what are
you gonna do about that and he does a
lot of this stuff and it's not only
building an a
it's just uh having more fun in the game

[2:57:18]
it's just uh having more fun in the game
which also gets people out of their
comfort zone right if you get people out
of their comfort zone out of the lines
that they're used to they're more likely
to screw up and make
mistakes yeah yeah so and he just went
75 and he does a lot of this stuff and I

[2:57:32]
75 and he does a lot of this stuff and I
respect a lot and I'm trying to do kind
of same uh but it's actually pretty hard
because you have to study a lot not to
uh [ __ ] up too much but but at least

[2:57:45]
uh [ __ ] up too much but but at least
it's more interesting that is the thing
right like I've I've I've been
struggling in ways to explain this
nowadays I feel like I have a good a
good way simplification has a place it
has a place what you what you mentioned
in like your Baseline strategy in your
Baseline strategy what you're trying to

[2:58:01]
Baseline strategy what you're trying to
do is you're trying to not [ __ ] up okay
you're trying to make the play that
can't be bad but from there if that's
all you do you stop to think and poker
becomes very boring and you don't get
the maximum out of your poker win rate
it's so that from there you can start to

[2:58:16]
it's so that from there you can start to
explore all the other option and try to
maximize your Rim rate TR to capitalize
on different place okay so both are
necessary to some degree if I would say
if you have no idea of what your
Baseline strategy is then by all means
go in the solver go build a good solid

[2:58:30]
go in the solver go build a good solid
Baseline strategy that's designed not to
lose try to simplify that as as much as
possible and then from there you can add
layers from there you can take more
information be creative on top of the on
top of the tables um uh actually this
reminded me the the thing that you said

[2:58:45]
reminded me the the thing that you said
what Stefan throw out of 75 reminded me
of something that Owen Mur said in one
of her previous episode he mentioned
when a thing when a thing that's not a
thing becomes a thing so basically you
do a thing that's not a thing but
depending on how your opponent response

[2:59:00]
depending on how your opponent response
it can become a thing yeah yeah yeah I
really I I really love that one that one
really stick stick sck by me I really
really really like that one also uh just
like I said I love the game and poker is
so beautiful because when your opponent

[2:59:15]
so beautiful because when your opponent
is uh going in some Direction all the
strategy actually shifts a lot and uh
sometimes you can say like uh I always
it's kind of funny that I always see
these like people who just screenshot

[2:59:31]
these like people who just screenshot
GTO Wizard and saying like Oh my he did
such a big mistake how he supposed to
play 5K and now he's just such a fish
there is no such a sent right here but
there might be a lot behind that and

[2:59:45]
there might be a lot behind that and
maybe he prepared and he doing just such
a great thing right here which you are
just don't understand completely because
um yeah if you try to loog strategies
and solver you can see all of this
really crazy uh shifts in strategies and

[3:00:04]
really crazy uh shifts in strategies and
uh
yeah and people would never play like a
GTO Bots I think because they're just
people yeah sure they can just go RCA uh

[3:00:15]
people yeah sure they can just go RCA uh
but if you are playing against people
and he's for sure honest and uh he plays
himself he would never play like a GT
bot I'm pretty sure and uh if you
understand his nature how and why is he

[3:00:33]
understand his nature how and why is he
uh deciding to to do something you can
actually uh differ a lot from dto
strategy yeah and I'm not saying that
I'm a huge Russia and I'm like
exploiting everyone but that's a really

[3:00:47]
exploiting everyone but that's a really
beautiful part of this game which I love
and which drives me a lot uh to keep
studying because it's so interesting
that and it's so competitive that um you

[3:01:00]
that and it's so competitive that um you
can um always do this like race you know
between you and your opponents and your
and population and all that so yeah I
mean like um some strateg which now
looks like yeah this is right strategy

[3:01:18]
looks like yeah this is right strategy
in two years in if people uh you know
change a lot can be not the best
strategy and other like for example
probably against people it's really good

[3:01:31]
probably against people it's really good
uh to uh like um I
remember um that um I love a Lain I I
don't remember his name mat I
he you had him on the pot and it was

[3:01:47]
he you had him on the pot and it was
really great po respect um and we
actually battle a lot on we wpn he is a
great player and remember he said that
he just um went crazy for betting every

[3:02:01]
he just um went crazy for betting every
hand from big blind and this is just
such a good thing that uh in pocker it's
possible to go like that and still crash
a lot and actually it might be really
good strategy in the pools where which

[3:02:15]
good strategy in the pools where which
don't have any like heart possible it
might be really good yeah I mean like
even let's say he played three bet only
he he played three bet only from the
from all positions right that's some
point he experimented he would never

[3:02:30]
point he experimented he would never
call only three bet all positions also
from
Big yeah and big blind is the most
important here I mean like the funniest
thing for me here is I think that it's
possible if you just um put all of the

[3:02:47]
possible if you just um put all of the
high stakes players in the pool they
don't get any H it's probably the best
strategy to just triet too
much I mean it's probably can be even in

[3:03:00]
much I mean it's probably can be even in
high stakes uh population it can be the
best strategy this is a really cool
thing yeah and czy I think I think kind
of kind of summing this up is like we
have to appreciate how and understand

[3:03:15]
have to appreciate how and understand
how fragile the equilibrium is right you
mentioned up there can do this can do
that for example I can throw out a
donkey but uh someone says hey you
shouldn't dunk here like well okay if I
dunk a board that should not be dunked
and if I'm over dunking it he should be
folding zero raising me 50 but he's

[3:03:30]
folding zero raising me 50 but he's
actually falling so who's the idiot now
you
know donke this thing about donkey is
just so crazy because every dunk which
is not supposed to be you should
supposed to raise like huge huge money
yeah you you should raise little and I

[3:03:46]
yeah you you should raise little and I
throw out a dunk on a board that I
shouldn't dunk and the guy FS I'm like
yeah then who makes the mistake here
yeah yeah and and he would take a
screenshot and say like yeah Wako is a
very bad shape he he haven't study por
didn't understand that this board should

[3:04:00]
didn't understand that this board should
not be dunked yeah exactly or also like
and also like like people don't know
your exact range it can also be that
let's say for example my dunk in a
certain spot I would say this probably
what happens more on turn river that
let's say my dunk is too strong or too

[3:04:15]
let's say my dunk is too strong or too
weak which part of the range should you
attack should you attack my dunk that's
too strong or should you attack my check
that's too too week and then like for
example if I don't dunk do they realize
I have a dunking range so my checking
range is not fully intact and do they
then understand the consequences of that

[3:04:30]
then understand the consequences of that
because you talked about sizing well
let's say I let's say I dunk out a lot
of my strong hands and I check a lot of
my weak hands then let's say the range
is intact the solver might be limited to
betting three quarters but if I don't go
on strong and check on my weekend
suddenly it can out bet 300% pot so you

[3:04:46]
suddenly it can out bet 300% pot so you
see someone you see Stefan betting 300%
pot while the solver says hey you can
only bet three quarters well probably he
understands the equities or how the
ranges are lining up in this situation
way better than the person
screenshotting GTO Wizard and trying to
make fun of Stefan right I would say I

[3:05:01]
make fun of Stefan right I would say I
would bet that Stefan has a better idea
of the ranges that are actually in place
and the equities that are are running in
this hand then than the person uh uh
observing
it I hope you you guys are enjoying the

over to mechanics ofp poker.com sign up
now and let me and Adam help you achieve
your poker goals in 20 24 Adam were you

[3:05:45]
your poker goals in 20 24 Adam were you
always in the simplified camp or are you
were you more trying to maneuver in the
rounds of possibilities that poker
strategy
offers yeah I think always star with
that simplified strategy that you can
execute at a high level so you've got

[3:06:00]
execute at a high level so you've got
that Baseline to fall back on I think
it's always really important and then
from there you can be more creative and
yeah I think I always had troubles when
my Baseline strategy wasn't strong
enough and I was trying to be too
creative on the edges but I kind of be
losing a bit of my kind of Baseline
strategy so being there

[3:06:16]
strategy so being there
Adam yeah get get too excited by novelty
sometimes and want to learn new things
so but I I do think it's really
important to uh as you guys were
speaking there as well I was thinking
about like the Pok player trying to get
better at the game and one element is
yes you want a good win rate but as you

[3:06:30]
yes you want a good win rate but as you
guys were speaking like to be curious to
continually want to evolve your strategy
keep getting better at the game there
needs to be an element of complication
problem solving to keep the Mind engaged
and and wanting to do more so yeah I
think there's a both camps I'm not on
either Camp to be honest in in terms of
where I said I think it's a very
important conversation to have around

[3:06:46]
important conversation to have around
build that simplified strategy to begin
with but then putting layers on top of
it and going into the Realms of the
complex strategies to uh to build more
more of more of strategy as well so yeah
I just want to bring a few more
questions I know we've had a long
conversation so far but I kind of want
to talk about like kind of going from

[3:07:00]
to talk about like kind of going from
the cube to the pocket table so um we
talk about some lessons you learn in
terms of thinking ahead from your kind
of speed cubing days what are some of
the lessons you've learned from your Pok
career that were unexpected going in

[3:07:15]
career that were unexpected going in
MH and that's a hard question I think
that actually I'm really grateful uh
poker in my life because it taught me a
lot like uh I'm I think you can poker is

[3:07:30]
lot like uh I'm I think you can poker is
like um this is too much of a beautiful
phrase but poker is like a miracle to
life because lots of thing lots of um
things you deal with and you struggle
with are like the same in poker and life

[3:07:48]
with are like the same in poker and life
and you have to do uh some steps to get
better in poker and same in in life and
yeah um so I I just like I said just

[3:08:00]
yeah um so I I just like I said just
really like the game even though
sometimes I can like cry about my run
and the like always poker all poker
player do I think uh I just love this
game because it's so beautiful and it's

[3:08:16]
game because it's so beautiful and it's
so complicated and it it has a lot of
stuff uh behind it uh which you uh have
to do in order to succeed in pocker and

[3:08:31]
to do in order to succeed in pocker and
this is the main thing which which I
love and as for points
uh as for compare
Compares on Rubik's Cube and
uh poker I would say that uh main thing

[3:08:47]
uh poker I would say that uh main thing
is just practicing I remember um in uh
speed cubin there was like this
Australian guy his name is Felix Zandex
and he was like a huge Crasher in that

[3:09:02]
and he was like a huge Crasher in that
uh in uh speed cubin uh back then and uh
he did lots of interviews and uh he was
like a star in speed Cuban he was a kid
and he was like 15 years old or

[3:09:16]
and he was like 15 years old or
something like that and he would always
say the same phrase and it's just stuck
in my mind H uh they would always ask
like uh how did you get your success uh

[3:09:30]
like uh how did you get your success uh
and all these question and he would
always answer just practice very much
just practice very much and it's stuck
in my head and yeah it's uh it works in
whole uh like in the whole life
I mean if you want to do something good

[3:09:45]
I mean if you want to do something good
just practice very much and just leave
it and I remember even it's not only
poker it's uh on my fourth uh year in
the University I lived in the dome with
a friend of mine whose name is Ivan and

[3:10:00]
a friend of mine whose name is Ivan and
uh he just uh at some point he thought
that he would like to play guitar and uh
he he just fell in love with playing
guitar and he started playing lot really
a lot and uh he was just playing every

[3:10:17]
a lot and uh he was just playing every
day like 10 to 12 hours and in one year
he achieved so much success in Guitar
like uh because he was uh my neighbor
and we live together uh I get annoyed a

[3:10:32]
and we live together uh I get annoyed a
lot uh and I was like just uh go [ __ ]
away from here with your [ __ ] guitar
I was just so annoyed but uh
I actually saw that PE that person came

[3:10:46]
I actually saw that PE that person came
from zero he never played guitar before
to playing such a good level he he could
uh play like every possible song which I
uh liked and I likeed pretty pretty uh

[3:11:02]
uh liked and I likeed pretty pretty uh
um I I I don't know for sure because I
don't play guitar but I think this a
pretty hard songs like Metallica and uh
yeah I so I love Metallica And I think
probably the songs are pretty H not sure

[3:11:18]
probably the songs are pretty H not sure
and I can uh just uh pick every song and
he would play it like perfectly and uh
within one year and U uh he played a lot

[3:11:32]
within one year and U uh he played a lot
for me I just liked the song and say
like play it and he would play like
really really good and uh hearing this I
was really amazed and I really liked in
the end of uh this year I I really liked

[3:11:47]
the end of uh this year I I really liked
when he played and I even begged him to
do that in front of me because he played
like really really good and this was
within one year but he practiced crazy
crazy a lot amount and everybody would

[3:12:00]
crazy a lot amount and everybody would
just laugh at him like uh always with
his guitar buying lots of guitar guitar
guitar guitar his life is just guitar
but yeah it's actually an example of my
life which I see that practicing is

[3:12:17]
life which I see that practicing is
consistency is the key yeah yeah I think
it's important as well like the the way
you practice and the way you get better
to like go back to the Matt Marinelli
episode of the podcast we heard he
talked a lot about deliberate practice

[3:12:30]
talked a lot about deliberate practice
and deep work and not just like shown up
to practice and learn skills but to
really be fully immersed in what you're
doing as you mentioned your friend there
he's just living that guitar like he's
fully going for it whereas some of
person will be watching a YouTube video
doing a little bit of some songs but
like not really fully engag in it and

[3:12:45]
like not really fully engag in it and
it's a very different type of practice
so even for yourself when you're
studying or learning poker you've
mentioned a few times in this in this
episode like um living it living poker
and that's very different to somebody
who's like kind of just dabbling or just
trying to get better so yeah I think
getting better at skills understanding
any skill is trainable and you can

[3:13:01]
any skill is trainable and you can
develop skills but you got to put a lot
of tension and effort into it deliber
practice for a long period of time and
do that consistently and once you do
that for a long period of time you
realize that wow everything's just a
skill that can be developed and which
skills I want to get good at and apply
my time to whether it's a Rubik's Cube

[3:13:16]
my time to whether it's a Rubik's Cube
whether it's climb the poker letter you
mentioned as well like how poker got
like lots of lots of things you're
developing as a person and I feel like
poker's like the ultimate hero's journey
so the hero's journey is all about
you're the hero and you take on like a
quest to u to achieve a goal and then

[3:13:31]
quest to u to achieve a goal and then
you as you on your path you hit
obstacles things don't go your way you
come create of challenges and you need
to level up your character in order to
keep going on the path and you keep
getting more and more challenges and
every challenge you go through levels up
your character so you're finally ready

[3:13:45]
your character so you're finally ready
to the for the end result to transform
or reach your destination and that's
normally when you have to fight like
your biggest demons or your biggest kind
of challenges and that's often when you
po the PO analogy is reaching high
Stakes or the vision that you had for
your career and that's when you have to
really work on yourself the most to

[3:14:01]
really work on yourself the most to
become the version of yourself at the
end of it and often you think that
journey is just this external thing
especially when you start out you like
make loads of money have the freedom the
lifestyle all external but really on
that Journey you realize it's all an
internal Journey it's all about you
becoming a better version yourself
everything around it the all the

[3:14:16]
everything around it the all the
external stuff was just that the outward
stuff but the internal Journey was way
more important and at the end of it when
you sit on the end of your career you
look back and go wow I became a better
version of myself from playing a card
game that's amazing that's so so cool so
you think for yourself like talking as
you related a lot of stuff I was like

[3:14:31]
you related a lot of stuff I was like
just picturing this kind of hero's
journey You' going through it leveling
up your character enjoying the journey
as well I think one thing I've got from
you from this conversation is the
importance of loving what you do the
importance of loving the pursuit the
journey itself and not trying to force
that I think for you even with the

[3:14:45]
that I think for you even with the
Rubik's Cube there's something about
your mind that gravitates towards things
and that just holds onto it I think he
mentioned I think he said it took a year
to go from for lot of people it takes a
year to go from 20 seconds of a Rubik
Cube to 10 seconds now that must be a
long year of fine tune and stuff that
most people go you know what I think I

[3:15:01]
most people go you know what I think I
think I'm done I I got a 20 seconds I'm
a pretty good Rubik's cuber I think I'll
call that one a good chapter but you
just kept going it kept going it kept
going so I think something out your mind
that seeks that want to be the best of
what you do I think you mentioned a few
times that competition so yeah really
really good I think I've learn a lot

[3:15:16]
really good I think I've learn a lot
myself in this conversation and I'm
hoping the audience go away and re
listen to a lot of the points anything
of yourself that you'd like our audience
to uh take note of from this
conversation or to go away from that
they could take action
on yeah I think

[3:15:31]
on yeah I think
uh I think I I have said enough uh and
uh I think when um you ask me this
question and nothing pops up IM
immediately probably I shouldn't say
much more so

[3:15:47]
much more so
yeah perfect well thank you very much
for your time I think you've shared a
lot of wisdom and a lot of ways of
dealing with challenges I think lots of
little lessons have have come throughout
this conversation and yeah I think it's
been very valuable we touched on a lot
of topics uh myself and R probably

[3:16:01]
of topics uh myself and R probably
sumarize at the end going forward but
yeah thank you very much for your time
we really appreciate the amount of yeah
energy you put into this conversation
and yeah I look forward to listening
back and thank you very much yeah I I
want to thank than you uh very much not
only for this PO but also for doing uh

[3:16:19]
only for this PO but also for doing uh
all of the pods because I
like I love the game and I love when
people try to um show it from like a

[3:16:31]
people try to um show it from like a
more athlet way let's say um Rene
mentioned uh much times in this SP uh
this word athlet and uh I don't think
poker is a sport but I think athlet is a

[3:16:45]
poker is a sport but I think athlet is a
very very good explanation of what you
should become in order to succeed in
poker uh yeah and so thank you a lot for
sharing this uh and for showing it's
more like in a way of uh maybe so yeah

[3:17:05]
more like in a way of uh maybe so yeah
sharing this way because all of the
ports you you really uh dive deep into I
I actually watched
uh lots of your parts really Lots um I

[3:17:17]
uh lots of your parts really Lots um I
can say that uh I'm really close to
being fun of your podcast and thanks a
lot for doing that uh and yeah thank you
for this fun thanks for having me um I

[3:17:30]
for this fun thanks for having me um I
had a great conversation and I practiced
my English which is also very good so
thanks a lot great conversation that was
with Nikolai Adam and he Main
takeways yeah I've got it quite a lot

[3:17:45]
takeways yeah I've got it quite a lot
he's got a fascinating mind and yeah I
think we start the conversation very in
depth with how he thinks about the
Rubik's Cube and then we went into uh
his poort career and one of the things I
wanted to note was the terminology he
used around this downswing period and
you might mentioned not losing your win

[3:18:01]
you might mentioned not losing your win
rate and the importance of when you're
on a down swing doing the right things
so that your win rate doesn't go from 5
BBS to 2 BBS to to negative and I think
it was really important how we talked
about rest and recover fre but the the
the mindset of thinking okay if I don't

[3:18:15]
the mindset of thinking okay if I don't
take precautions if I don't H take more
recovery study more do the right things
to prepare myself my win rate is going
to go down and it's almost like a bit
naive to think on a down swing you just
play through it and you come to the side
everything's great so I think his
experience of having a six-month long
downswing really reminded him that look

[3:18:31]
downswing really reminded him that look
like my win rate isn't guaranteed I need
to do things so my win rate to protect
my win rate so to speak so yeah I think
it was a really important lesson of how
not to lose your win rate use rest as a
as a tool and basically how to take
breaks to uh get your mental fatigue

[3:18:45]
breaks to uh get your mental fatigue
down but also your curiosity back I
think overall is thinking about how to
uh perform at a high level which takes
me to the next point where he talks
about treating poker like an athletes
and I think this is your your
terminology as well of how to prepare
properly for poker and Trea everything
holistically around performance

[3:19:00]
holistically around performance
optimizing your schedule your days so
you can perform at high level of what
you do and it's so important if you want
to play high Stak pocker to realize
you're competing against other guys who
are pretty smart they're pretty
dedicated so you've got to do everything
you needed to perform at a high level
and how much your win rate is dependent

[3:19:15]
and how much your win rate is dependent
on the things you do off the table I
think that's a really big factor as well
that as we if I listen back to this
podcast I'm sure I will take more more
notes on yeah the kind of advantages you
gain from approaching yeah poker more
holistically and maximizing all
lifestyle factors then another one I

[3:19:30]
lifestyle factors then another one I
want to wrot down was coming to terms
with the worst case scenario and he uses
I like these little Reflections he was
using on his phone where he was doing
these little audios very nice I I
thought about doing this myself but
never create a habit I've been more of a
Journal writer but it really made me
think how important it is to uh get your

[3:19:45]
think how important it is to uh get your
ideas out but for him he was using it as
a preparation tool for his grinds so
he's quite risk averse person or he
likes to uh yeah kind of scared of
losing his bank Cy as he mentions so for
him he needs to meet that challenge head
on so going into a poker session to
remind himself that it could be a losing

[3:20:00]
remind himself that it could be a losing
day losing session and to be okay with
that to come to peace with that so when
he sits down to play loses five bins Los
10 b as he's going through that
experience like ah I was pray for this
it's not that big of a deal so yeah lots
of Tools around preparing himself right
and also he mentions perspective skills

[3:20:15]
and also he mentions perspective skills
of remind himself that he could die at
any point or death is an option so how
bad is this down swing all this
experience he's going through I think
all of these are like little tools that
he's picked up throughout his
experiences that have allowed him to uh
not only progress to the stat of playing

[3:20:30]
not only progress to the stat of playing
but also enjoy the process what I liked
about the conversation was how much he
he loves PO he enjoys the game he enjoys
the pursuit and I think that has been
allowed to happen due to uh yeah a lot
of the kind of work he's put on into
himself away from the tables which I
thought was really really good how about

[3:20:45]
thought was really really good how about
yourself r one of the main things you
noted down yeah he got really fired up
when we started to talk about all the
little things you can do to gain some
win rate here right and we really talked
about like that bigger picture win rate
when people think win rate they think oh
I'm gonna improve my win rate let's dive
into the solver but no he was way more

[3:21:01]
into the solver but no he was way more
interested in like the management side
of your career how can I manage my wiim
rate I think that was really a big
takeaway from this conversation he also
at the end uh he summed it up I think
himself he said just practice very much

[3:21:15]
himself he said just practice very much
he said yeah you can just study poker he
said studying too much if thought was
actually a leak you should go out there
and play and he said also that a very
big part of your wiim rate is just being
there and showing up I think it was
Patrick Howard that said the same thing

[3:21:30]
Patrick Howard that said the same thing
I've heard this before in one of the
previous podcasts a very big part of
your wiim rate is just showing up and
being there when in this case the VIP
decides to uh yeah donate a lot of money
so he said just being around there being
the lobbies and also taking that in

[3:21:45]
the lobbies and also taking that in
consideration right I think we gave the
example if you play a 10-hour session
waiting for the V to arrive in the
lobbies then maybe it's not a great idea
to already waste all your energy in the
first few hours of your session playing
tables that are very bad okay so again
bigger picture uh we also talked like

[3:22:01]
bigger picture uh we also talked like
strategy quite a lot uh a main take way
that I wrote down is that studying GTO
and creating your default strategies and
maybe simplifying here and there
especially in the more
uh unfrequent spots is
definitely you know advisable right

[3:22:17]
definitely you know advisable right
we're trying to play defensive trying
not to lose have a good Baseline but
from there kind of appreciating how
fragile the equilibrium actually is and
how many possibilities actually open up
when we start to think okay when we
start to ask ourselves the right

[3:22:30]
start to ask ourselves the right
questions verying in line with uh with
our philosophy I think I got pretty
fired up when we talked about that topic
as well definitely something that we
like to educate in the mechanics of
Poker as well and last but not least as
you know New Year big goals decide on

[3:22:45]
you know New Year big goals decide on
having bigger goals and think about what
you have to do in order to achieve them
he was kind of just grinding mid Stakes
because in his reality it was like yeah
high stakes is that you know I'm just
grinding a little bit of mid Stakes we
also talked about like the safety
feeling that this gives right people

[3:23:00]
feeling that this gives right people
think that staying at a certain stake is
actually safe but actually it's not
because it's a constantly moving thing
there's no stagnation you had to go
forward or backward and often taking
that shot and trying to reach higher
Stakes is actually less safe if you
think about it than just staying there

[3:23:16]
think about it than just staying there
and being grinded away and at some point
you know you have to get back to a real
job but he at some point said okay I'm
going to go for high stakes and thought
about well what do I have to then do so
he builded a baseline strategy he
studied like 10 to 20 hours and every
spot creating a good Baseline strategy
not only GTO he also talked you know

[3:23:31]
not only GTO he also talked you know
looking at like exploits that he could
pull off based on stuff that he saw in
population uh and then from there just
execute execute toward that bigger goal
which for him was to to reach high
stakes so I don't know what your bigger
goals are in

[3:23:45]
goals are in
2024 I'm sure you have them and for that
