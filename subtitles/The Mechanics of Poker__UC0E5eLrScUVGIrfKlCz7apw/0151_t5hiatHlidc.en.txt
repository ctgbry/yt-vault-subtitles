i think this bad puts a lot of pressure
on
five sixes seven eight fives not so much
and having a club
probably jamming this river
don't you guys just hate it when you bet
flop and turn and then you end up on the
river with a complete air ball and
you're thinking to yourself
man villain is never gonna fold top air
here so you can either sigh
and give up
or you can grow a pair and jam all in
like a real box

mechanics
yes yes welcome back
another play and explain
the zumbo just started running
i am afraid though it might die
okay that's not good huh
because this poker mirko guy from
bulgaria joined i don't know him but
the three hands that i played with him
were quite
and all played
so
i hope another recreational joints so it
doesn't scare away the other
the other players
or that the poo just starts fitting and
people just
continue playing
but hey
corbin and getting anyway queens
maybe not against the er we're also
quite deep i think actually first er we
should probably fold
140 big blinds deep
jamming into two people okay yeah this
is probably a fault i would say
but i don't know the guy and that is uh
that is quite difficult about it
i think given the fact that i don't know
the guy
i would probably call but i'm not very
happy about it
i seriously because queens are i love
yesterday everything with queens he
raised he had he brought no king races
we're all in baby we're all in this is
it this is a big moment of truth this is
it
either we wing everything or we lose
everything but we come on baby there we
go tense is a good hand for us
no
what the [ __ ] [ __ ]
the [ __ ] [ __ ]
i lost everything
yes queens as well
i think that is uh
quite a good scenario
not really sure about that one
it normally would be a fault
so far he's been playing a little bit
wreckage but you know
not 100 sure
go for the check raise here with jack 8
good hand to double check raise
depending on the turn
and going to call the squeeze here with
pocket nines
yeah so for example i think this is a
good turn to go for a double check race
blocking the eight and blocking the jack
there's a check here by dennis
but
actually the the initial squeezer check
folded the deuce three nine which is
quite surprising as the do's and the
three
do not really connect all those well
with my range
like the pairs that i will most likely
have is five sixes sevens
eights
this is actually not really a donk bet
but
even uh
in the theme of the video
or given the fact that we are making a
video let's try a little donkey and see
what happens
007 out there dealer
ornate
or spade
one ace
i knew oh he knew i knew the donkey was
coming i
also know i mean
okay well we got it true
why do you do that the ace nine here
look quickly looked it up in the sim
just for gordon
it is indeed
gto at a very low frequency fifteen
percent dunking
i got a fan of the channel shout out to
mrs mr bianchi for missus you never know
but if you look at my youtube analytics
mister is uh
most likely but hey you never know
let's keep this channel uh
gender neutral
i'm just going to three but this this is
very loose actually i think this is way
too loose okay i apologize apologies and
five or something would have been fine
and three is maybe pushing it a little
bit but hey remote high
wouldn't have done it always
punish me dennis
dj dennis for the people who don't know
dj dennis
shout out to all my brazilian fans out
there
if you don't know dj dennis go to
spotify type in dj dennis
they hear some rio de janeiro funky
sounds
and my personal favorite
isukia vida
[Music]
let's just go back to playing poker
shall we
dj dennis goes for the check race or is
he from dj dennis ukraine
all right let's give the ukrainian some
money shall we and we should probably do
this huh we should probably
hey that's a half part i think check
raising river is probably good
you should just
that
oh jackax himself he shouldn't really
bet too much 5x and 7x on the flop
i'm gonna check back the seventh
five is very bad even though he should
probably barrel most if not all of his
5x
i would just win first queen 9. now
we're going to unleash hell on this
guy
i think the only strong hands you want
to check on the river are the ones that
can actually throw out the check race
i think that that is definitely
important you're just gonna check call i
don't think w there should come from
check calling with made hands
but if you can check race then checking
definitely gains something
pocket aces well that's a hand we're
gonna play
i think i did mention already in
previous videos the chances of you
getting a walk with aces are quite high
or faltered through a bet
like we have another recreational coming
in
see a flop
[Music]
they want to see a flop
it's a very bad flop
three four five
six
that's a king i bought never mind
king i bought so
let's not [ __ ] with the king i bought
here
firefox
he's gonna be pretty [ __ ] on this
board lacking a lot of strong hands very
unlikely that he has pocket force
or pocket threes
interesting turn
i think this bet puts a lot of pressure
on
five sixes seven states of fives not so
much
and having a club
probably jamming this river
don't you guys just hate it when you bet
flop and turn and then you end up on the
river with a complete air ball and
you're thinking to yourself
man villain is never gonna fold top air
here so you can either sigh
and give up
or you can grow a pair and jam all in
like a real box
even though the club isn't that relevant
only thing we block i guess is king
queen of clubs
okay so it is relevant in terms of him
having ace queen
i guess it kind of depends on his turn
folding frequency
with
other pairs in his range like for
example pocket eights or something or
pocket nines
or pocket sevens or pocket sixes
but yeah i think blocking ace queen
there on the river and blocking a flush
obviously we would prefer to have the
king of clubs to also block king jacket
clubs
but hey
cannot have it all
ace eight i'm gonna throw a small bit
i can also check
actually don't know how relevant really
my queen of clubs is probably it's very
unrelevant
as king queen of clubs usually just
three bets free like the call call range
it's very defined
with ace queen
a bucket paris
maybe some suited stuff like
king jack of clubs
and queen jack clubs just folds flop
so
actually i think the queen other than
blocking ace queen is very unrelevant
but then again we do get there on the
river with ace king i think also ace
queen there's not much else to do than
gem i guess
so i guess you just jam your king queen
off suit with club
and then
ace queen plus
should
we we're jamming for pot
but yeah you should probably actually
already this is one of the spots where
maybe on the river we should just not
bluff because
he has already folded all his weekends
on
earlier streets
for example first the half pot on the
flop he can probably already hold pocket
eights
maybe
my range is not tight enough for that
another sure
like
if if i would watch myself back
i think i would have played that i was
playing that hand quite sort of on
autopilot
i think both flop and turn are out of
better than the river given the fact
that i had a club [ __ ] ace queen and
i thought buckingham flush
made it quite an easy gem but maybe i'm
completely off
given the way his range is on the river
if his range on the river even though
how unlikely that is is basically ace
queen
rocket fours pocket threes
or a flush
not really a range we should try to jam
into
a really weko yes
the podcast with
with zenyao
for example if i tell you that that is
the range
then everyone knows what is the correct
play
and this is something interesting that
xeno said he said
if you give people the ranges they
probably know they usually know what to
do
but the problem is that people usually
don't know what the ranges are i thought
that was very
kind of bad to bear normal sizing and
just
see what this guy does
so if he gets an eight eight would
probably just check
also unlikely that is a jack because i
have attack i think it's likely that he
has
an just probably gonna bet something to
get the belly out of it
if he's a straight he probably still
raises or a worse boat
with the straight up mean the king queen
straight i don't think he has the eighth
grade
okay so he actually did have the eighth
straight interesting
that he because usually when the board
is like double fluster i expect them to
just fast play it on the turn
obviously versus a straight i just want
to jam the river but given how dry the
board was i figured he would probably
jam that on the turn so i thought his
range was made way more weighted towards
a miss flush draw
or something on the weaker side
and versus dead range
again a good example of
you know the range diverse dead range i
think batting small is definitely better
but versus a range that contains an 8
which is likely not raising the river
but always calling jamming is better
let's take a look at this king queen
hand we squeeze in the small blind which
we should do
some of the time
off of the time
this is then going to be the call range
of the button actually i wanted to start
with the call range on the button first
he had a screen off which he should go
on if you split on the button should
call some of the time
and some of these pocket pairs right and
as i also mentioned on the three four
four fours and threes are very unlikely
i was also very surprised if you
remember earlier on when i had nine said
on the deuce three nine the guy checked
followed them like okay basically i have
nines but i don't really have these
hands right
um
then when i squeeze
big man folds kind of falls
he is going to call always a screen
his suited hands like king queen suited
but
somehow here the weights they seem quite
high but king queen suited for example 3
bets 50 50
and here the weight seems a little bit
higher i'm not really sure why that is
and he should call some of his pairs
okay like i said usually what you will
see is that it's very pocket pair heavy
is queen and then like some suited
product
this flop however i said is very good
for me but actually it's it's not that
great for me in
hindsight we also look at the equities
i'm only 52 favorite
i actually thought that was different so
i'm definitely oversea betting here as
you can see king queen for example is
basically never betting i was actually
quite surprised
i would have definitely better this spot
more often so
if we then bet half pot he should indeed
i think i've already said i i just got
the ranges completely wrong i said that
even maybe he would already fault eights
but that's way more applicable let's say
we three bats small red versus ep and we
bet half pot then ace can maybe already
fold the plot but
my range is just so wide that yeah my
range is way wider than i actually
thought which i could have probably come
up with because i actually have king
queen off in the hand
um
during ace
we indeed see the smaller sizing that i
used i think i went 90
i think that's fine king queen with a
club definitely barreling i think now as
played it all makes quite a lot of sense
in theory now he should still on the
turn call with quite some pairs right
also depending on how often he had that
i think the six probably six and the
seven are probably worth so let's say i
have five six suited or six seven suited
you're blocking those so eights and
nines are definitely way better
in terms of suits it doesn't want to
have clubs in this
scenario because it blocks the bluffs
and the board is paired so if you hit a
nine it's always a good nine so usually
you want to
i think i talked about that in my
previous video as well when ranges are
really tight
you want to continue the pocket pairs
without the flush draw and this is a
perfect example
um
[Music]
so he should still be united and then
ask plate if we get on the river but
like i said king queen never bets then
on the river it's
an easy jam actually any king queen that
gets there probably also because in
position will sometimes have ace king i
don't
really place that way it's queen so it
probably actually weights it towards how
often
they now have this hand on the river so
on the river it's fine
depending on how often he calls all
these hands on the turn that now going
to fold the river actually it still
should call
river some of the time
especially now with the club which is
quite interesting so let's say for
example the turn you fold
you fold the ones that have a club right
because you don't want to have the
block the flush draws and now on the
river you have to call the ones with a
club if you if that's something that you
have in your mind then basically you
always fold
right if on the river you're like
i want to have nines with a club so you
know because we
uh
then we kind of blocked the flush but if
on the turn you fold the knives with the
club
then you don't have a calling rate
sometimes sometimes this happens you are
like on the river or on the on the next
street you're like oh i will only call i
think this hand is a better hand to call
it but in in truth you've already played
that hand different in the early streets
so you don't really have that hand it's
quite interesting you can catch yourself
uh
with that kind of operas on the river on
the river you actually still have to
call like some paris
um
the blocker in this case does play
because apparently he has queen jack
suited some of the time
and a screen actually sometimes starts
to fall but yeah we block ace queen
that's obviously very good
ace jack should also already fall some
of the time because it's blocking my
bluffs with the jack i guess
so
i'm not really sure what what to think
about my play let me know what you guys
think if the river is a good jam yes or
no i kind of feel like i got sucked into
it the way i played the hand but i'm
obviously oversee betting
this spot i mean snap called ace queen
which
it's not necessarily making that much
money in theory but definitely versus my
range it does
now you can tell me if
this was very low frequency that you
will show up with an eight there or
that you have a different read on the
situation
um
seventh
actually guys for the bet this is
actually one of the boards that you
could definitely uh have a betting range
on
i think sevens with a club we should
just help you
bye
i think we have if we have eight five we
want to get a lot of money in i think
with king five just over betting his
best
and then when i say with ace five we
want to get a lot of money in
this is definitely not the best play
with ace five
h5 probably wants to bat small
maybe even king five already but i doubt
it
he still raises
yeah that feels like eight five to me
i guess he could have king five as well
but it's very few combos and these
fights quite a lot of combos
everybody okay also skin five that's a
good scenario
so basically the fact that i'm not happy
versus the race
is the reason
5 should not overpat
basic
the king 5 here on the river i was
rambling about the difference between
as5 and king 5 and you can clearly see
that indeed ace 5 usually prefers to go
for the check race and the other 5x1 to
go for the overbet this is a very
important concept guys
playing your value hands in a way
that
maximizes
your profit
is very important
you want to spend oh if you know if you
want to spend your time on something
spending on that playing your value
correctly
getting the max amount of money
overbetting here at ace five i would say
it's a big mistake
but we overbet king 5
and he went for the race
he actually should still race
with
a 5.
that is actually quite interesting
that apparently i don't understand
what's going on okay then why
okay then we
okay so
i can see what's going on the ace
he's not betting the ace five because he
blocks the calls right a lot of the ace
heights are going to hero call you
that's why i personally think in game
that if someone has 5 8 here
they're not always going to find the
race
correct me if i'm wrong i mean you you
guys saw that i wasn't that happy with
king 5. for that reason i wanted to play
h5 different
you can you do see some calls here with
with the 5 that if you would check you
would obviously bet with a five
and then we can draw a little check rate
obviously it's also the benefit that we
can get some money out of some bluffs
that's always a benefit of checking as
well
but so yeah that is actually in the
solver at least the main difference i do
think actually in practice
it
people don't
really make the call now obviously i
don't have to look at what happens
versus the race yeah maybe actually we
re-raised with king five we do actually
revisit with king five all the time i
think that's very funky i think then
we're uh
over playing our hand i mean
but hey let me know what you guys think
we have some backup accuracy to go with
rh3
check race
trying to fold out two random cards
getting called by an ace
i don't mind this hand actually as a
barrel
and asia i'm just gonna check down
with both of a8
with a fellow youtuber in a pool shout
out to flashcall i'm not mistaken
i don't know if the a3 was spewy we will
look at that afterwards
very good word for me expect to get a
check
you can bet half bottle one third on
this exact board i personally prefer to
bet one third
but i think half part is the
gto strategy
do six
it's quite pretty
that's very spoon down let's try to dump
it let's see if it works
punta 1965.
don't try this at home guys
i will say it was fun
i won't say that it was necessarily
possibly
okay now we actually make straight
check
get queen 10.
we've also blocked the river
i think both blocker and check are both
fine
check is probably reserved if we're
talking theoretical okay check is
probably reserved for your two pair sets
type of holdings and usually if you have
a straight unblocking all the pairs you
just want to bet so probably this is
just a one-third bat
however i thought the versus the
perceived recreational
checking here was slightly better
as i think if
a lot of hands that would still call a
bet so let's say he calls the river with
two pair plus
i think those hands especially
recreational would have
already raced
on an earlier street so i thought those
hands were less likely and i thought it
was more likely just had two high cards
with a spade
that would bluff if i check
but yeah then you lose value from a one
per hand
if you think the one per hand would have
called
but there's a straight and a flush
i doubt so
oh so you're one of those guys waco you
bet when you are behind and you check
when you're ahead
in this case i was
but like i said we're playing versus uh
if
if i would have played this hand this
way versus the non-recreational i would
have bet the river
but i would probably not have played
that hand that way
with opening 3.22
and like i said perceive recreational
i'm not even sure yet
but hey we came to play some poker
it's a very good board for the eye poker
i'm gonna start off with a
ribetsky
and a call
and on the river if he checks most
probably we're just gonna fire out
and if he bets we're just gonna call
and we're quite happy about it he
actually uses the three-quarter sizing
which actually i think is good here
oh
reverse 10.
get king queen
versus strategy the bad skin queen three
quarters on the term we should probably
implement lead
i don't think leading on the 10
yes he will sometimes revert to 10 but
this is temporary going to go
because it depends on your size
but yeah if he has
if that if that bad sizing that he used
is very heavy weighted towards king
queen we should beat the river
do you want to make 2022
your greatest poker year ever
now i've done a webinar on how to do
that in our academy which we have made
available completely for free so go over
to pokerambition.com
and let me help you achieve your goals
hx63
i think our hand is good enough to bad
call check race
i would definitely not go too wild on
this board i think it's a good spot i
think he should definitely check raise
around
30 probably
i think that's good
he checks we're just gonna check as well
i think when the board is double flush
draw
you should especially because it's
parity should not be betting too much
with
like a three or pocket deuces
this is something that a lot of people
often get wrong they will bet
on the nine of spades but they will
check on the nine of clubs
and i think i'm just gonna check it down
and probably lose
versus like deuces or something
let me even check raise a7
we sort of had the same hand but then
different
similar properties
in queen we're getting a little bit
deeper
not deep enough for me to start calling
this dome you could make an argument for
it
for under 125 i usually
continue story
actually i don't mind puddling this
board
some of the time
let's just go
[ __ ] it
it goes
bad turn
and
check
check this one
and i think i'm just gonna check give
this one up
give another board run out
and given the fact that i made a pop pad
on the flop i expect him to do quite
some folding
oh what here
but
the reason i went pots is because we
were a bit deeper basically
depending on how deep you get but
usually when you become slightly deeper
than
normal
that you could call it that way
you're big sizing like normally i would
bet like three quarters on that board
but because we're a little bit deeper
your big sizing just becomes a little
bit bigger
there is a flipping point though it's
not like if you're doing a big glass b
deep you could i just bet twice the pot
okay there's a jam here from carl all in
boom what you gonna do
picture to play we don't block
the ace eight suited so i'm gonna fold
i think in general that's quite a
profitable play you're facing over bet
140 which i like like i said i don't
think this guy is recreational
this is actually a hand that wants to
sometimes race
let's just go for it usually
usually in these videos when i say
something that is sometimes
i'm usually just doing it
my resizing was a bit big though when
seven to fifteen
oh it's fine
i'm also doing this for the video sega
sometimes have uh
basically if there's a low frequency
play i'll usually try to do it on video
yeah
just creates for a little bit more
entertainment i guess
but we get
a little bit of a bad run out i would
say
we don't have a diamond that's not good
but you could say that
a diamond does also lower his value
betting
threshold is that is that the correct
word
so sometimes you know you could say that
a diamond there gives him more value
hands but then sometimes it gives him
less value hands than the hands that he
would now check back because the river
is a diamond and therefore he actually
bluffs more on the diamond than
not here big bad here good play i'm
going to call the check 9 because i
haven't got it to the nizzles
and
he bets again hey play this hand i
really like his size team
difficult what did this guy have
he had
a6
so
good value check raise on the flop
the river was
not a diamond we could again maybe
implement the leading strategy
at this end we don't really have
e140 which i think is good especially
when you become a little bit deeper i
think it's good to start a little bit of
a bigger bet
in the sim we only have 125. we can
indeed see that ace 9 sometimes wants to
check race and like i said we rolled
high because we were making a youtube
video so we decided to try out a little
track race indeed goes to
it's a meme race
right roughly
6 25
13. i think
seven yeah we went maybe a little bit
too big but that's fine
we go for the very small raise
and calls
diamonds
we block or do we check
check
correct it
he then does the block
we then do the call
and then do we lead the four river
let's say a deuce river right
i would say a ten percent is broke
weak
very weak very weak silver
okay
obviously
would say on the fourth diamond maybe
yeah we do have some gems now
okay 12 percent that's not very weak the
jambo in is not a very weak play
not a very weak play at all
jack and you should just assume check
behind his a6 i actually should indeed
he should indeed sometimes bluff the a6
he was onto something
he was on to something
guys
if there's even a 10
chance
or 10 frequency leads on the river
i want to find it
you can see i'm in the dunk bath fan
club
on all streets
if you are also on the dunk bat fan club
guys let's open a discord
the dunk bat fan club
and all we talk about is dunking
on all [ __ ] streets how awesome would
that be
leave a comment down below if you want
to
join the dunk bat discord
interesting actually daddy thought about
it on the river with a6
oh wait he actually had the ace of
diamond that's why i thought about it
with a6 maybe do something funky
oh i poker
very satisfy the gto crowd
this would be a little bit spewy
i'm just going to call this time
let's start with check out the force you
can also bet but i don't really want to
get raised
i can just check on
i'm just going to check fault
the h5
set phase
pocket force
can we squeeze out a bet if the five
pairs not it's way too loud
just checking and hoping to win versus
king eye is probably the correct plane
we even got three milder back guys
started to free mill to go follow him on
youtube as well i [ __ ] i [ __ ]
pensionized
but no instead of pensionizing he's just
you know
jamming stacks in the middle grow a pair
and jam all in like a real
suppose if i want to block by this i'll
go for it on it then
i think most 10x will probably just see
that
we've got the a7 very good flop
i'm not going to see what the board does
often but i like the a6 here i'm going
to go for the check
probably play check that
i like mine for a bachelor pad
just put some pressure on uh
the pocket pairs
i'm gonna check over here with the a6
he used uh
63 sizing or something it's a bit of a
weird sizing the four is very good for
him
he goes medium twice
yeah the
four's not a great card
we're hoping to see something like seven
eight offsuit with the seven of clubs
eight o'clocks something like that
but you know him just having a king is
also quite likely
but hey
and that's the thing right i don't know
with with the sizing scheme used maybe
he just always has king eight
because i can also imagine that given
the way the board ran out
that
he would definitely want to over bet on
the river wizard
so his sizes scheme seemed a little bit
face up then why did you call wacko
good point
but there's definitely something that in
the future to take in consideration
you would play more against his opponent
now i wanted to look at the strategy
with the a6 let's start actually on the
flop i mentioned that i wouldn't bet
this board that often indeed 65 checks
and you can clearly see that a6 of all
sixes is the one we prefer betting the
most
then on the turn
uh we bet one third he calls turn into
a6 definitely checking almost frequency
it sometimes adds in a little block but
if you run to a higher accuracy this
will probably just disappear
check and now we can see imposition
mainly doing a lot of big betting
the most dominant size i would say is
over
over bet
personally i would just stick with a pot
bet here
um he went for
something a bit
5 35
like 63 i'm not like i said i wasn't
really a big fan of it i then prefer to
bet a little bit bigger and then check
more that hands that king eight
let's just say he went 75
we sometimes actually already fold or
raise a six
we called i would have never folded a6
a river is a four
check
an imposition has a clear value but with
a displayed
a king eight and we sometimes have a
call with a six
so as played it's fine but like i said
the sizing isn't
as
commonly used
okay and indeed like a bluff that i that
i mentioned seven eight or eight nine
with a club for example these are very
clear bluffs and then in the higher end
as well right the jack 9 the queen jack
those are type of hands that you
want to look for
sixes doesn't really do actually much
because you can see that like a set
usually wants over bet at some point so
i don't think we really block any value
but at least we unblock all the bluffs
so
i think that is a fine smaller first big
blind
but mainly pay attention to to
do the turn strategy okay this is
definitely not a line that you should
take too often right
here i raised the flop with force he
made a small three but which i think is
a good play
i'm kind of forced to call and hope to
turn a four or hope he
gives up and i miracly somehow win
but you know these are all not great
scenarios the deuce is really good
actually
the deuce is really good i expect him to
do very little bluffing here
on the deuce as my line is very
consistent with the deuce
so
now we have to pray that he has a
queen
should we have blocked the river
actually
maybe we should have
but then we had the pocket force end
where we made a little flop race with
the pocket force
we can indeed see the pocket force wants
to race quite often probably a little
bit more with the ones that block them
for suited is that even relevant
and for suited is not in there right
okay it is in there so yeah
then it probably wants to block the them
for suited
um
yeah that's
because it doesn't raise space
well obviously we thought about that no
wait we didn't because we have a diamond
okay should have maybe taken that into
consideration
um
we raise and he found the flop three bat
with queen nine shout out to this guy
okay he actually went overboard with
queen anasud but to be fair i would
probably also go for portrait pocket
forces so
he raises
actually ray's smaller than this we now
call expected
turn as a queen then he hits the queen
and then he checks he's one of those
guys
that's when he's behind checks when he's
ahead
we nine
should now actually he should just
basically
do a lot of padding which i think makes
a lot of sense right the queen is a very
improved card for you
i still have all these low pairs
check
should we have pep maybe no of course
now the river is a deuce of space should
we bluff
that was a question today
looking at the range now we just win a
showdown often enough
let's check raise easy goal could
actually even through better flop
would i
that's right
i think wherever he's go
a really wacko you have thought backed
up kicker and a flush draw
i want to bet the river i think the turn
sizing
the three quarters it feels a little bit
like king queen
and we can have still quite a lot of 10
jack in our range
ace 9 i think we should probably be
barreling
given our hand
i think we're playing actually versus an
unknown here ico from bulgaria
queen jack
that makes sense
it felt like something like that
then we had the ace queen started off
with a high frequency i would have
probably got it a little bit more often
than what i saw here yes queen jack off
suit would basically should almost never
check race a screen if he did flat it
should always check race so he
definitely went on the loser side
with the check race here we had a screen
of hearts we just called
turn is the seven of parts
and i expect again to see quite some
over betting again you can see the 20
125 is going to be the most dominant
sizing
and then these half spots this kind of
hands are more reserved indeed for like
the medium hands like queen jack
um
however if we look at let's say we group
all spots and three quarters in there it
should for example also include some
queen sevens some queen nines sometimes
pocket fours
um
however the dominant the most dominant
sizing these really strong hands want to
do are the 125. so then usually what can
happen in a split like this is that
people too often put strong hands in 125
and weaker hands in the 50 75 region
which makes it easier to read them okay
you could for example prevent that by
using
uh
125 and check if you only have 125 and
check if you only give the solver 125 in
check
queen jack can no longer bet so it will
just go to the check
or you can try to play super optimal and
use all these sizings and then make sure
that with a certain frequency a hand
like pocket force or and like v9 is
going to be in there
but definitely something to look out for
so indeed better three quarters
we actually do some of those range
actually raising did actually
um
was actually something that i had in
mind because
like i said i already felt on the turn
with the 75 maybe we can now even race
for value versus that interesting that
he doesn't raise kings
i guess then he has less
king queen if we have ace queen
with more in queen
and we have obviously more equities on
backup equity
ah but then
probably if we then race he folds king
jack
and king 10 okay so that's that that
that is why we also can get some sort of
protection
uh and then indeed now we can get value
from the
actually would have been a good play
paul
reverses six
now queen jack should actually find the
ten percent i like this bet a lot too
this is really really kind of
sexy but he did check so here he did
decide to not include the smaller sizing
and now we have a screen i went for a
medium size which is fine
and
i would say oh
you should actually
no he should probably win
you should actually i mean he played his
hand
solver approved
but like i said versus players who you
play against with quite often it's
definitely something to keep keep an eye
out for
donkey donkey let's go
we get a fold just like that
let's call this with the
ico in the big lines let's see what i
could do don't squeeze ico
then it comes up betting
and we have nothing going on with our
hands
i thought the queen jack was
quite interesting i'm pretty sure that
i mean this really depends but these are
things to
just like with the king eight and
that
my name is carl plate obviously i'm not
drawing any conclusions we saw two hands
but from my experience
it's good to watch players
or keep an eye out when players use
certain sizings that could be too faced
up
or could be too weighted towards a
specific hand class
and this is definitely a good
tell if you can get an accurate read on
people
and then from there make adjustments
not saying that that's the case with
these two players and these two hands
that we saw but i'm just saying
especially when you move down in stakes
i'm pretty sure a lot of guys that
haunted now are quite transparent with
their bad sizing they would have
better the set or at least that would
have bettered a very strong hand for a
bigger sizing on
both
turn and river
and kept the medium sizing or
yeah the actual hand that they're saying
that they have for the medium sizing
i think this is also why especially if
you study poker
wait if you study if you study theory i
think it's
if you study the solver
if you study theory or solver whatever
you you should pay extra attention in my
opinion to
the
the three of the aggressors
because then if you start to understand
what is a thing and what is another
thing
you can start to see when people deviate
from the most frequent sizing and then
you can start to draw conclusions from
that if you see that more often first it
first it alerts you like hey something
is going on this does not really seem
optimal
and then the next question you can ask
yourself is why
why would you use a different sizing for
what purpose
is that because you have a very strong
hand or because you have a very medium
hand or
in a cent
this is something in my opinion that you
have to get good at especially at lower
stakes because there is just so much
information out there so it seems like
the poo has died
which is very unfortunate but
also a little bit expected as i said
already since the beginning
