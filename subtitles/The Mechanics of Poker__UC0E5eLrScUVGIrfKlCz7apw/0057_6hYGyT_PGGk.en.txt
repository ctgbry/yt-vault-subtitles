i don't really
see what this is
a seven ha a7
that made a lot of sense a seven
[Music]
do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo hello hello hello boys and
girls
we went for a little delayed see bet
and here we actually have a seven deuce
and even on a day poker guys we're gonna
be
representing the seven deuce here here
we got check raised we have an easy code
and then turned queen five into a bluff
and we actually flop something with the
seven deuce
i'm gonna start with the seabed i see
some future straight draws even so it's
very positive
this is definitely one of the best
scenarios i guess we could hope for
if we play the seven dudes we do get
check race which is
not that great but let's see what we're
gonna turn
it's good it's good that's good
that is very good come on i'm lucky
i am lucky um over bet
i think i'm still going to tag along
river flush and there we go interesting
interesting stuff
let's see what he does
are we gonna get cooler okay checks
interesting uh we have an easy gem
i love the seven dudes guys i love the
seven dudes we're always right
max yes
i mean
oh the seventies we got the servant
i just show them drunken style and then
take it for poker like bring some fun
enjoyment
he's thinking about it he's thinking
about it oh
we win this spot actually where we're
printing actually money now with the
seven dudes already
72 big blinds he folds now that is very
unfortunate
very unfortunate and we have our
favorite hand again five seven suited
oh oh whoa whoa that's a tripsy that's
what they call tripsy
here
king
where's mr burns straight out of the
simpsons
hey gems good luck
oh we have a free roll oh i didn't even
notice it i lost it quite late
well there with the ace jack wall it's
now five-handed mr helms joined the
table
and probably ain't folding basically any
any time hey barrels easy call again
and easy call them
and hollywood decided to come back in
the i'm back in the game
150 yeah i don't think i'm ever folding
uh ace jack so
like i would i would say especially also
version over bet i think this is a
better call than uh
i had like king three or something like
that
is jack eight shout out to the jack
eight bluff i face
a three-quarters barrel here with the
ninth so we have an easy call again
river is quite dicey okay he checks he
probably has
a 10 i'm afraid of oh we actually
actually choked it with a6
he choked it with a60 you know what that
means guys
called a race here from mr hollywood
there's a barrow with the king eight
i think actually i'm gonna jam
am i i'm just gonna call and let the
random factor do its thing
get general with the king six which is
perfectly fine and we're gonna call if
he ships it in
and we're gonna race versus this sizing
so hollywood's thinking about it it's a
good sign that's a good sign
oh he was considering it with a better
head than ours okay we didn't see that
coming
so hollywood is a little bit of a
conservative recreational
on the looks of it or how he played that
hand because i was actually just pretty
sure we were just printing and he would
just call us with ace deuce or something
here phases three but with the pocket
fives the swap is set for his mr burns
that guy has won enough money of me
three four seven
decent flop for me i will have the
threes in the fours and the sevenths and
he probably won't i will also have the
fives and the sixes
but even though everything i just said
he still decides to come up betting or
hotspot
i think we have a call
not the greatest of turns will give a
lot of the sea betting range
a good hand or equity
i think actually without a diamond i'm
probably just going to fold this
he checks off but flop
check turn i'm just going to make a
small bat at it
because
and i think i'm going to check the
ops ace king with a diamond
you turn the jack 10.
like i said the theorem wasn't the
greatest
going to check all this
and check the term
hey weka while moving up the stake you
played cash i always played
cash actually and i'm
going to what actually
there's a race quite a big race
batch flop next turn
i don't really see what this is
hey a7 a7
that made a lot of sense a7
that made a lot of sense
suckers think you're tripping with yes
i'm
i figured like because he was raising
quite big right
so he's basically saying that he has
the where's the hand he was basically
saying he has
the nut flush which i'd already see a
lot of hands stab
chagging checking that are not flush
but then he says basically he could also
have a boat
like sevens for example that makes some
sense on the turn to check
but even like if he would have let's say
he called king jack
or king queen offsuit or something the
button more likely i think to just
barrel the turn
and then race maybe a little bit smaller
yeah
yeah oh my god
am i the best 10 admit it sit say it
you have to say it or deuce on the other
hand i think i'm definitely calling i
think i'm definitely calling
hmm
we pink two pair
here with three by the a screen gonna
start over a small c bet
this is gonna be interesting what he's
gonna do basically we're calling
he checks good for him i'm gonna barrel
the ace queen
ah he gave up the six seven yes yes yes
yes yes
[Music]
and he's a jammer on the river with the
ace queen the knight
does pair which i'm not super thrilled
about we do have the queen
of diamonds so that's good but
yeah i think it's most likely holding
just going to be a worse ace
he indeed had a worse ace he has a great
hand to call down with
he also realized that and he snap called
and we took in a nice little putt thank
you very much sure gonna format here
with the [ __ ] queen
where we're gonna get our money in both
let's go okay that's a call
not the greatest of flops but i'm still
just gonna bat and hope he has queens he
just queens okay let's go
he has a skin flip
actually i think i'm just gonna jam here
with the pocket kings
he followed an ace okay probably an
eight screen suited we're making some
money here with the for
4.8k stack here with the forecast stack
as we doubled up through the flip we won
twice
we even made a set along the way gave
away our set
our set lock unknown but hey
but hey but hey but hey trying to see if
they don't want to play some 1020
four-handed
on 888 but they're not interested
because in my opinion five five-handed
wreck battling is quite useless
i mean there's literally nothing else
running so i was trying to get something
else to go
like it would be just way better if we
just if one just stands up
and joins the other table so we play
like three tables of five
and four-handed okay let me see
one king two king three king four kings
which is a four of a [ __ ] kind
i'm gonna start off with it too bad
i'm gonna rebat the ace king here
and i hope monza has a jack or something
oh this is a very interesting turn
gonna go for the jam bit greedy bit
greedy not really sure how this spot
works it's not every day that you flop
quads and the turn is an ace
obviously to turn it's on an ace we're
just gonna do quite a lot of betting but
when the ace comes it gets a little bit
dicey
i do like my turn block i'm not really
sure what the river sizing is supposed
to be
ace five suited
i'm gonna let this month ago i'm gonna
call
right out flop nacho well that's uh
we're
almost there
i think i'm just gonna jam on this board
jamming hope solid strategy
queen's okay 27 equity one time come on
charlie
where are you i am lucky i am
ah we're not lucky
while we flop trips
yeah and the plan is obviously that i
will just keep on making master classes
until we have all spots like i said i
already have all the spots laying around
as i gave all the lessons already to the
cfp so you're getting
premium cfp quality
without the long-term commitment i think
that was the sales talk
all through with wda's 10. here with
king 10
i think blocking is the correct strategy
let's start off with that high on c bats
we have an easy call during i don't have
a great hand to call a barrel
with much right off ace five or
something he checks
i think i'm going to
check on am i
gonna go for that
where's the checklist i think i have a
fold this is already i was already
doubting if i would bet this hand yes or
no
but i think
would be quite spewy for him to do this
with six five or something since there's
no draws on the board
so i'm gonna three right here with the
suit well that's cause i'm distributed
but
this case too bad
and that's not a bad flop i might say so
i'm gonna see that the flop
don't think i have to be very concerned
that if i'm in the big blind
or like lower paris as i don't think he
uh
he will always call him to the through
bat
i'm gonna three better pocket kings
get here fold you call so turn is not
the grades of cards but i
think we have to barrel
that's gonna do like i said i'm not very
concerned about fours
or fives so
i think barreling is still fine
i'm gonna check the turn on improved and
in general i have quite a
bad hand to do anything with
basically ever i think i'm just gonna
give up on this hand
unless maybe the river is a queen
queen of clubs or something or the jack
of clubs uh
diamonds
and then you suddenly go all in this is
kind of how it goes
and then false that's how it goes guys
[Music]
oh here it goes check check check check
check check check
he bets the river interesting
i'm tempted
ah king six king six
they try to bluff me guys they try to
bluff me
but it just doesn't work
oh we flop a straight that's good that's
what i'm talking about my
straight big bet that's what i'm gonna
go for
um
and we turn flush he leads
[ __ ]
let me raise this trade flushot to go
with my hand
actually i'm just gonna call let's let
it develop
better flush was like a better for some
raising but this one is actually quite
good huh as has everything going for it
but i decided to just keep a hand like
king tam with the king of diamonds
ace them with the ace of diamonds in
checks
betting and re-evaluating hey volts okay
